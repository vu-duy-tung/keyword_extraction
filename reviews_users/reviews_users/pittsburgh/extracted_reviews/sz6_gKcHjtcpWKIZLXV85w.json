If I had one complaint is the price point of the meal was a bit high for Pittsburgh and is one of the most expensive places to eat in Pittsburgh, but you will have a great meal, you can't miss with this place",

When we were seated downstairs we did not have anyone wait on us for at least 30 minutes. Then we still did not have a waiter the sommelier served us (Eric was great he took over our table completely)   My friend and I ordered the crab mac n cheese and it had no flavor. We also split the duck duck goose burger which was very dry and extremely tiny for the price. The bread fell apart so you had to eat with a fork and knife.   I had very high expectations but am very disappointed the only good part of our night was the bartender and Eric",

However, when we got our food my entire dish was cold and my eggs were not cooked at all, while my fiancees food was hot. When I told our waiter he quickly took my plate and got it replaced in a timely manner. Overall the taste of the food was decent, but the kitchen needs to work on timing so all the plates at one table are all warm.",

The prices were actually less than I expected and I got away with a $25 bill. My buddy Jack walked out after spending $42 so there's that. I'd skip the drinks if you can get by on water - haha. $5 for an unsweetened iced tea?! Melville would be mortified, but I digress. Amongst our group we ordered Herb Baked Eggs, a Savory Bubble Waffle, two versions of Eggs Bennedict, a Croque Monsieur and an American Breakfast. No one left disappointed or hungry. My herbed baked eggs were probably the lesser of the dishes, but I didn't mind. A bit too much \"herb\" and a bit oily, but not a terrible concept. Brunch competition in this town is TOUGH, so I'm not sure I'd go back again and again, but it was a lovely visit.",

I had a bloody mary and the steak and eggs. The service started off a little slow but we had a large group and they brought out some complimentary monkey bread while we waited for our food. The bloody mary had a bit of scotch in it and was a nice smokey flavor.  I ordered my steak for my steak and eggs medium rare but unfortunately it came out well done, although my friend's steak came out perfectly medium rare as she also ordered it.  Another friend also ordered a steak rare and one piece of it came out rare, but the other pieces were medium well.  However, the staff were gracious and apologetic and fixed these issues very quickly, comped our checks and gave us gift certificates for next time, so I really appreciated that.  They explained that they are still getting to know their fire grill.  The chef and the manager both came out to speak to us a few times to make sure we were having a good experience.",

I have to admit that I'm drawn to the farm to table concept. The people who work here are very friendly and efficient. The dishes incorporate as much of the New England feel as you can while being in Pittsburgh. I absolutely enjoyed my side salad. The dressing was bright, acidic and citrusy. I ordered the Eggs Chesapeake and while the idea is great, the poached eggs were a little over and the crab didn't feel fresh (understandable for being in Pittsburgh). The hollandaise was think and very citrusy with a bit of a kick. I enjoyed it but the lemon was pretty strong. I also had the mussels for an appetizer. Again, the sauce was great but the mussels themselves just didn't feel fresh. Overall, great little place and I'll probably be back!",

The Bloody Mary's were excellent, the Eggs Benedict were delicious, and the monkey bread was perfect in both flavor and texture.  They do put a lot of hollandaise on the benedict, but that's how I like it.  Of you like less sauce, then I would ask them to halve it.  The unexpected highlight was the little fresh greens that they put on the plate with the benedict.  It was very lightly dressed and balanced the heaviness of the dish perfectly.  A great palate cleanser.  We both ate it all.  The waiter was very friendly, and the check was  reasonable for such a terrific meal.  We'll definitely go back here.",

After doing some research, I realized that it hasn't been open all that long... so I couldn't count on my trusty Yelp reviews! The menu looked unique and delicious- I was super excited to be one of the first to check it out!  We had dinner reservations for 8 of us on a Friday night. The location of or, The Whale is in the new Distrikt hotel downtown. The atmosphere inside is very unique and is based off of Moby Dick. Every single detail in this restaurant is thought out from the nautical themed ceilings down to the chapter book menu. There was a raw bar and smaller tables upstairs but we were seated downstairs which was great for a large group! It wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be for just recently opening but it was a very relaxing atmosphere which was perfect after a long work week.   For my drink, I ordered the house gin and tonic. It was served with rosemary as a garnish and was super refreshing! Others around the table enjoyed an array of cocktails that they also enjoyed. For our meal, Chris and I decided to share one of the smaller seafood towers. It had shrimp, mussels, clams and oysters. We also ordered a side of the hot sauce to put on the mussels which was good! The shrimp on the tower was the biggest shrimp I've ever seen and was so good! The seafood tower was a nice light meal for 2 people but was way over priced for what you receive. My only complaint about or, The Whale is their prices but it is a fun and unique place to check out in downtown Pittsburgh for a night out.",

We shared an order of Monkey Bread, which was yummy but not as good as other homemade versions I've had- basically it's nearly impossible to mess that one up. I had their house mimosa, which was so tasty and worth $14 IMO. My husband was very satisfied with his espresso, which can be very hit or miss at restaurants that don't have a dedicated coffee person. I ordered the savory waffle, he ordered the steak and eggs. Mine was pretty good- but I wished they put less maple syrup as it sort of overpowered the savory aspect.  The egg was perfectly poached, which is a major deal to me, and the bacon was very nice. I could not even with the sausage. My husband got the steak and eggs with chimicurri sauce. The steak was cooked medium rare as requested but a bit chewy. The outside was nicely charred. Now here is the big miss. The fingerling potatoes that accompanied his dish were not cooked. We decided to leave well enough and not ask (he was questioning if that was intentional- couldn't have been lol) but that kind of did us in. We do not send food back- ever- so whatever.  I probably wouldn't suggest it for brunch, but I'd return if someone in my life were dying to go. So three stars for edible and I've had worse, but the Steel City offers many many many better brunch spots.",

    "text": "Eric was our waiter.   He set the tone for the evening.  My husband and I frequent Pittsburgh, but have never had a meal like this.   We started with a seafood tower. The shrimp was huge, and generally that means huge iodine flavor, but these were fresh and wonderful.   The oysters were perfectly briney and fresh - paired perfectly with the dry prosecco recommended by Eric.   Not a fan of prosecco for it's sweetness, I was somewhat dubious, but it was dry and full bodied at the same time.   Awesome.   Escargot was the very best We've ever had.  I had the monkfish - cooked perfectly with these deep fried parsnip chips and some heavenly light potato puree.  Hubby had a rib eye with herbed butter.  Let me say, the restaurant offers some sauces for the steaks.  It would be sinful to put a sauce on these steaks.   We've been to Berns Steakhouse in Tampa, and Carne Vino in Vegas multiple times.   The quality of the meat is equivalent, but the preparation was better here.   The spices were solid and wonderful.    The ONLY thing we didn't enjoy were the smoked mussels on the seafood tower.   NO BIG DEAL.   There were only a couple.  The bar is so diverse, and the staff so friendly.   This is the best meal we've had in Pittsburgh - and we've been to all of the downtown group (tako, butcher in the rye, floor 2, etc...).   Do yourself a favor and GO NOW!",

    "text": "When it rains it pours they say and it surely seemed like a hurricane the day my friend and I dined here for lunch. We had reservations since it was restaurant week because we didn't want to chance dropping in. We were seated/greeted right away.   We both had picked out our lunches prior to arriving and we both went with the or, the whale burger. She wanted hers done \"medium rare\" and I prefer mine \"medium well\". The first course was a choice of soup or salad. I went with the vegetable chowder and she went with the Caesar salad. These items should have been brought to our table timely, but they didn't arrive until 30 minutes later. Somehow they ran out of soup at 11:30 am. This was pretty frustrating because these things shouldn't take long to bring to a table. However, I will say the soup was the highlight to this meal because it continued to go down hill from here.   The first bite I took out of the burger was pretty much raw with some blood left on my plate. My friend ended up with my burger and I ended up with hers. Our waitress took the burger back to have it cooked more. My friend ended up eating hers anyway, but mentioned it was flavorless.   The third course was a chocolate chip cookie which I was really looking forward too since their pastry chef makes them fresh daily. However, the cookie was pretty small and solid. I was hoping it would be soft and warm. They were nice enough to take half off our checks, but I'm not sure if I would return given the lack of organization.",

Even though we visited the restaurant with no specific purpose, our server Ryan went above and beyond to take care of us.  His recommendations... just perfect!  The whole fish we had was charred in open flames and was cooked to perfection.    We came here with our little one too and they have an amazing presentation for kid meals.    They do have a nice wine list, but you would want to have some crafted drinks!  The main bartender made two of her custom-crafted drinks.   Reason why I don't have any pics is because they're that delicious.    Lastly, for an even truly unique experience ask for Harry.  He heads operations in the restaurant and the way he treated us, making sure that everything was perfect, was worthy of recognition.    We already made our next reservations.  We'll take more pics next time",

    "text": "I recently went to or, The Whale for a friend's birthday. I was excited but slightly nervous because of the prices. I thought it was seemingly slightly overpriced for the options. Our reservation was at 6 but I arrived early and had some cocktails. The drinks were excellent. My favorite was called the \"broken arrow.\" It was a warming kind of bourbon cocktail that even had  Maggie's rum in it (I hate rum) but it was delicious and not overly sweet!  For dinner, I ordered a half dozen of oysters and monkfish that came with parsnips and brown butter. The oysters were pretty disappointing. They just didn't have much of a flavor profile. The monkfish was cooked perfectly! It sounds like an odd \"go-to\" option but I do order monkfish almost every time it is on a menu and this may be the best I have had. I do still have some criticisms. The parsnip was on the plate three ways, pureed, roasted and fried. All three were delicious but the  combination of that and the brown butter was a little too sweet for my taste.     I liked my meal, I liked the ambiance, I liked the decor and the drinks. I do however think it all comes at a pretty high price that I'm not sure is worth it. I am never going to be that person that says \"this is Pittsburgh, not New York\" in reference to the pricing. Because, we deserve nice things too. I just eat a lot of really great food and I do think that there are restaurants where I have a beautiful meal, get my bill and am in complete shock at how small it is...where I think about how I would have paid double the price for the quality. Overall I really enjoyed the restaurant and would go back again.  I don't think I will rush back though...maybe for a cocktail!",

Given that, I did think our waiter still could have checked in on us more. As far as the food goes- it was delicious. Everyone loves their orders, I don't think you can go wrong. I got the eggs Benedict Chesapeake (eggs Benedict with crab) and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I also ordered the Bloody Mary, which I didn't love, so maybe order one of their other brunch cocktails. Overall- this restaurant is a Pittsburgh brunch must.",

    "text": "Came here for a fancy date night on a Monday evening. The restaurant had mostly empty tables when we arrived, so we were seated quickly and the server came to greet us to take our drink orders and see if we had questions regarding the menu. They have quite the book menu, so our waitress went through each \"chapter\" with us. We put in orders for the drinks (a Tuxedo and I've forgotten the name of the drink I got, but it reminded me of a mojito) and started looking through the menu.   The interior was quite beautiful, and we had a nice time looking at the decorations and art on the walls waiting for our drinks. After about 20 minutes, the drinks arrived and were delicious and really beautiful! Unfortunately, on an empty stomach, I didn't want to have too much alcohol too quickly. it took awhile to find the waitress to get our orders in - about 20 minutes after we got our drinks, so a total of 40 minutes after being seated on what appeared to be not too busy of an evening. Longer than what we hoped, but we were in no rush.   We got the smoked trout rillettes to start, which arrived pretty quickly. It had a nice side salad, two crostini, and seasoned cucumber as well. The spread was rich and delicious - a great pairing with the rest of the starter. They also brought over two buttermilk chive biscuits with butter which were soooo delicious!   (After eating all of that, I was able to dig into my drink more as well :))  For the main course, my boyfriend got the NY Strip Steak with Beef jus and sides of mashed potatoes and cauliflower, and I got the half roast chicken with a side of crab Mac and cheese (I am a sucker for Mac & cheese).  Steak - Medium rare, great flavor and great paid with the jus.  Cauliflower - grilled well and a super big serving! Looked like half a head of cauliflower on a plate!  Mashed potatoes - Very creamy and well seasoned. Super tasty.  Chicken - cooked well and also came with braised endive and a raviolo (was like a ravioli with a soft boiled egg yolk inside). I didn't care much for the dish unfortunately, as the mustard sauce was very strong and was all I could taste on the plate. However, once I dig into the chicken more, it was pretty good. Crab Mac & Cheese - rich and tasty!   No room for dessert, but we left with 2 boxes of food and a promise to come back again!",

They were out of two of the dishes we ordered, so we had to substitute.  That happens, I understand.  It was a little upsetting to find that the wine we ordered, which was quite tasty, for $75.00 normally sells for $18.99.   I do understand mark-ups, but this seemed excessive.     All in all, I wouldn't go back or really even recommend this place.  There are so many great places to dine in Pittsburgh, I'd try others first.  We were, however, seated next to a charming couple, so that made the night very pleasant.",

We ordered for main courses the lobster and crab rollatini whole lobster and sides were mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was so much food we had to take it home...and got to enjoy this afternoon for lunch. Lobster and crab rollatini had such a nice rich flavor and packed with meat.  The lobster was a nice size and the mashed potatoes were not what you think of when you think of mashed potatoes...looked more like a full potato broken up...still excellent. Asparagus nice green and Long. Also had a delicious drink and we ordered the cheese cake desert to go. We will be adding this to our food rotation.",

For my entree, the crab cake was well spiced and the hollandaise sauce was some of the best I've ever eaten. The egg was poached perfectly and the greens on the side dressed just right. My only complaint was the English muffin as one piece was a bit burnt. Otherwise, a fantastic meal!  Lovely atmosphere, great service (Thanks, Stephanie!), and good prices. This is definitely on the list for a repeat visit.",

You cannot expect customers to pay these prices and not train your staff. We could have had the same meal at Eddie V's for the price, and the staff there is professional and trained. Food was not bad but the prices are outrageous for the experience. We paid between $50-$100 per person and we were getting pushed out of the restaurant by the server.",

Second time there tonight to celebrate a special occasion was disappointing. We waited over 45 mins for our entrees to arrive for a table of 2. Table of 4 next to us ordered at the same time as us and had eaten, paid, and left before we received our food. The worst part is the manager clearly was aware of the problem but instead of asking us how our night went, he never came to our table but checked in with all of the tables around us. Disappointing service. The ribeye steak also didn't live up to the $65 price tag--not even close.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Whale for our anniversary. When we made the reservation they had inquired as to whether our reservation involved a special occasion . Pretty cool, because the entire waitstaff congratulated us after we arrived.. Nice touch. Also they provided a complimentary glass of champagne. Very classy. These touches did make for a very special beginning to our dinner. As a general matter our dinner was a positive experience. Ambiance was good. The food was well prepared, but there was nothing exceptional about it. I probably would have awarded another star except for the following: 1. Our waitress was totally unprepared. She did not know the specials nor the various preparations. Also her service skills definitely need improvement. She was friendly but disappeared for long stretches. We spent almost 3 hours there after being seated, much of it waiting for our waiters return. For the prices at this restaurant they definitely need to use a higher level of waiter/waitress. 2. This restaurant uncharges you for EVERY THING. I was charged $3 for butter to go with my $50 lobster. My wife was charged $3 of chimmichurri sauce.  Fortunately I did not order French fries-- I am pretty sure I would have charged me for the ketchup. Come on man, this restaurant will really turn off patrons if it continues it's ticky tacky up charge practices. 3. This place holds itself out as a seafood place but only had 2 seafood entrees. Frankly, the menu items ( especially appetizers) were not very extensive. 4. Seems they should update the restaurant seats. My seat reminded me of long grade school days sitting on a hard wooden ( not very comfortable chair). This restaurant is relatively new so I assume they are still working out the kinks. May try again later to see if they improve the experience",

The cod chowder is unexpected and beyond delightful as were the oysters and crab and shrimp appetizer. Only drawback is the pricing.  I dined with a crowd used to dropping $150 pp for dinner, but the prices are outrageous for a city like Pittsburgh which has a very affordable cost of living. Drinks - $15 each.  Bowl of soup -$15. Duck burger (admittedly had foie gras) -$45!  And was underwhelming. And the most insane part? Sauces are $5 each and butter is $3. What? I have never heard of a restaurant charging for butter regardless of how glorious it may be.  I recommend going to the bar for a drink and a seafood app.",

The service started very efficiently, but it did get slower as the meal went on (again, there were like 20 of us, so that's certain to have contributed to the wait).  Staff was very friendly though.  In terms of the food, I was really impressed.  The very small salad in a very huge bowl was a little odd, but the portions on the rest of the food were very satisfying.  We started with seafood towers, charcuterie/cheese board, and some crab dip and grilled octopus....I only tried a little bit here and there, but everyone was raving about it.  I had the seafood stew...spicy, but excellent.  Reminded me of a cioppino, but with more aggressive heat, which I personally like with seafood.  Several people had the short ribs, which were massive and, as I snuck a bite, deliciuos as well.    Atmosphere is so interesting and perfect for a date night.  The price is hefty, but the quality of the ingredients is enough to justify it in my mind.  Our experience left a good enough impression on us that we're eager to go back and try it on our own (though probably as a special occasion restaurant).  A very nice edition to the Pittsburgh dining scene.",

Our waitress was pleasant, but it was difficult to hear her over the music and bustle of the kitchen. I ordered the wedge salad and scallops and my husband hand the cod chowder and New York strip with garlic smashed potatoes.  We received the bread at our table. It was biscuits with butter (both of which were flavored but I don't recall with what).  They were mostly unremarkable, but fine.  The presentation of the starters was a bit over the top. The chowder was presented with the cod and potatoes on a dish and the servers poured the \"broth\" over these items at the table. Also, the wedge salad arrived in an oversized dish. I understand the \"feel\" that they are going for here, and appreciate it, however I think it could be achieved with a smaller salad bowl and a different approach to the soup.  Both were delicious, although there was a little too much dressing on the salad.  The presentation of the main course was spot on. The steak was perfect and so were the scallops. I will say that I was unsure what I would get based on other reviews, but they must have taken other reviews seriously and improved the quality. The steak was cooked just as requested and taste amazing. I'm not a fan of butternut squash, but the puree with the scallops was delicious. We did wait a little longer than expected between courses but the sommelier filled this time with her recommendations and anecdotes. Although our waitress was MIA, the sommelier more than made up for it. Also, the support wait staff was great. We also order a dessert that was the special. It was fine, but mostly unremarkable. The pleasant surprise was in the size of the coffee that was provided with dessert. Overall, the food was fantastic, but the presentation and staff could be better. I would definitely go back again.",

Eric, Somalia, introduced just the right wines to accompany our meals. Too full for dessert. Went back for brunch the next day and was just as pleased with the meal, ( the bacon !!!!)

Even though we had a reservation and there were a number of open tables it took 15 mins to get seated. Then 15 more minutes before someone took our order. Then 25 minutes for brunch food to come. Evidently the kitchen was very understaffed. The worst part (beyond waiting an hour from your reservation till your food came) was that the food was cold and not very good. Ordered Eggs Benny. The two poached eggs were literally cold and also overcooked. Hard to explain and never had that before. I guess the pre-poached the eggs and left them in tepid water for a while. Not what I would expect from a chef driven restaurant, at all. Even the bacon and sauce was lukewarm at best, so nothing was actually being made fresh or kept hot. My wife's eggs were similarly overcooked. We both agreed that we would not be back. We also heard from the staff that they are understaffed for dinner but didn't see that ourselves.",

The service though was A+ so that should definitely be given credit. We started with the escargot and that was good, well cooked, not rubbery. Then we ordered the ribeye steak, crab Mac and cheese, salad, and beets to split as our main. The dry aged steak was excellent but the beets had probably a quarter cup of pesto for 8 little beet pieces so it was over powering and all you could taste in the crab Mac and cheese was old bay. The salad was well done and had a nice peppery flavor but nothing to write home about. Also don't charge $2 for chimichurri if someone is ordering a $70+steak. All in all this was one of the most expensive restaurants we've been to in Pittsburgh (more so than appetizer, wine, and dinner for two at ace hotel, acorn, cure, morcilla, etc. ) and the food didn't live up to the price. It's a solid ok but not great. Which is a bummer because I LOVE merchant oyster co. So I think I will just spend my money there.",

The tables were totally booked so we took a seat at the bar (check out the cool wall paper, by the way).  The service was attentive considering a full restaurant with many drink orders flying in.    I began my meal with the cod chowder.  Priced at $15, I was a bit incredulous, but I have to say this was the very best and most unique chowder I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  The piece of cod was thick and succulent placed center bowl with a beautiful garnish of red radish, julienne strips of leeks, and seated over a selection of gorgeous young potatoes.  The broth?! Oh my gosh, the broth!  It was so rich and layered with gorgeous seafood and butter flavor perched over the onion/celery back notes.  Truly delightful and I will return just for the chowder.  No lie.  My entree was the scallops.  I don't feel they were as successful as the chowder because the corn puree was just too sweet.  It overpowered the delicate taste of the scallops and the tender herb salad.  I liked them but was hoping for more scallop flavor.   We skipped the dessert this time but would like to try it next time.  I love that we have a new fine dining option downtown.  Wishing this team all the best as they continue to refine their menu in the coming months.",

I knew it was farm to table by reading some reviews prior to our visit. We selected several appetizers: the featured appetizer was a mozzarella ball over mushrooms, apple slices with focaccia bread; escargot; grilled octopus and grilled quail. All were delicious and filling. We selected a Caesar salad to share (plenty big for 2 people I might add) as well as the Lobster/Crab Rollatini-so delicious! The noodles are made in house and they make most items from scratch. The wine selections were great as was our desserts-pound cake with beet ice cream (refreshing and light); a chocolate cake with stout caramel and glazed bananas and a small piece of cheesecake to go! Our waitress was attentive, friendly, informative and honest when we asked her opinion on the food. She even gave us a brief history of the building, which was nice. The ambience is eclectic and comfortable. Parking was okay; we parked a few blocks away since the Valet wasn't at the station when we pulled up. No biggie as it was a nice night to walk a few blocks. We'd definitely go back to this restaurant. Check it out if you haven't been.",

We had the savory bubble waffle and eggs Chesapeake and both were nice size portions and were delicious.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the service. It was very slow. We were seated for about 20 minutes before we even placed our order and waited 15-20 minutes at the end for the server to process our payments. Our total time for brunch was about 2 hours, which is longer than usual in ny opinion.",

We ordered and waited too long for our food. A man on one side of us said that yesterday's lunch was a 45 minute wait time. The table next to us said our meals were sitting under the heat lamp. Our waitress brought coffee, and I told her our meals were waiting. Soon the \"host\" brought them. Hubby's American breakfast was cold. My Benny breakfast with the Hollandaise was delicious.  I had asked for the Chefs breakfast, but was told the kitchen was out of it. A lot of mixed feelings here.",

The atmosphere & decor are beyond lovely; from the story book menus and sea blue coffee mugs, to the gorgeous presentation of the dishes, everything was so thoughtfully done.  We had a mimosa and a Bloody Mary; the mimosa was very good and the Bloody Mary was exceptional.  They had a thorough menu that looked great for breakfast, brunch or lunch. As a vegetarian, I felt like I had a lot of unique and yummy options. I had the granola with greek yogurt and steel cut oatmeal, both were excellent. The blackberries in my oatmeal were melt in your mouth.   One of my FAVORITE things was the lack of any straws except for a metal straw in the Bloody Mary! They said they also have paper straws. I have seen \"farm-to-table,\" \"vegan,\" etc places that put regular straws in all the drinks - WHY :( thank you or The Whale for your conscientiousness!!  Would definitely be back!!!  Lisa",

Tried it again last month and was IMPRESSED. Menu had more business lunch options like sandwiches, salads, etc.  Tried the Poutine and it was OUTSTANDING!!!    Had lunch there again today and was back to unimpressed.  Had the Poutine again and it was not so good. December version had fresh lose sausage and a hearty gravy.  Today, the sausage resembled slice up breakfast link sausage from Foodland and the gravy was the consistency of 2% milk.  Excellent if you catch them on a good day...not so much on others.

    "text": "Had an excellent birthday meal at Or, the Whale. We came on a Wednesday evening. There is valet parking for $8, which was nice. The restaurant has a very nautical theme. It was interesting that you had to walk down to the restaurant.   Their menu is all locally sourced and aims to be farm to table. Somethings were not on the menu due to them not being in season anymore. We started off with their homemade biscuits and butter. The biscuit was delicious and I could taste the fresh chives.   Our food came very quickly. I had the scallops. My friend had the mussels and we split the crab mac and cheese. There were 3 scallops, but each were huge! The squash puree and grilled green onions went perfectly with the scallops. My friend was shocked as her mussels was an appetizer, but the portion size was enormous. There were easily 50 mussels. I had a few and they were very fresh. The crab mac and cheese was also delicious, creamy, and rich in gruyere.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate pot de creme. The chocolate creme was very dense. The granola was an interesting addition. Overall, we had an excellent meal. The prices were moderate to high, but the food was worth it. A much needed quality seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh. Looking forward to coming back!",

    "text": "Just. Wow. I have been waiting for this place to open for what seems like years. Last night I FINALLY got to go to dinner!  **keep in mind that this is a seafood restaurant and can be pricy. I've seen some reviews on other media complaining about the price point.   Parking: we parked at First Ave garage since the night rate is a flat $6 and it was less than 5 min to walk to the restaurant.   Decor: absolutely stunning. The Moby Dick nautical theme was beautiful. The mural of the whale on the wall, strung up bulbs, ropes from ships on the ceiling and the pictures on the walls were so awesome. And the menus are old books that have been stamped with the restaurant logo! The menu sections are divided into chapter names. So clever and it appealed to me since I'm an avid reader and book lover.   Food: oh. My. God delicious! We started with the grilled octopus ($18). It was expertly wood fire grilled with the perfect char. The pieces were generous and not overcooked. The chimichurri was the stuff dreams are made of.  Next we had the Guppy Tower ($80). This thing was massive and perfect to share with someone else. There were 12 raw oysters, 12 raw clams (which I've never had before), 6 GIANT prawns, some steamed mussels and pieces of snow crab. The house made hot sauce was really tasty. The clams tasted like briny saltwater and weren't my favorite but weren't awful.   We got a side of the crab mac n cheese which was a real winner. Nice big chunks of crab, the cheese sauce wasn't overly cheesy or watery. You could taste every part of the dish.  Dessert was the ricotta lavender cake. I've never had lavender in food before and it was definitely perfumy and potent but not overpowering. The lemon ricotta on the side was amazing.  Overall I loved this place. I wouldn't get a tower again since it was so expensive (we only did because I had some gift cards haha). Can't wait to go back for brunch one day!",

    "text": "It astounds me the range of opinions on here for \"Or, The Whale\", and the lack of dinner reviews.  I also, right away, want to refute the reviews stating the service was slow.  Our (my girlfriend and I) could not have had more attentive wait-staff across the board.  Hopefully this one sways you to check this place out for dinner.   Located in the Distrikt Hotel in Downtown, \"Or, The Whale\" has quite the quirky layout.  The bar seems to be on the same level as the hotel lobby right on the other side of the wall--it and the restaurant have a separate entrance for guests not staying at the hotel--and after entering through a revolving door and going down a flight of stairs, you're in a very modern and nautical themed dining space, with a nice glance into the kitchen.   A disclaimer before I continue, \"Or, The Whale\" is in the category of \"a nice dinner out before any artistic ventures in downtown or as part of a special occasion or romantic night out. It would also be a good fit if you've got company in town or you want a nice, somewhat fancy sit-down meal.  That's a long-winded way of saying it's not cheap, which is a very good thing.   When my girlfriend and I got to \"Or, The Whale\" for our anniversary dinner, we were immediately greeted by the friendly wait-staff and led to our table.  We poured over the menu, much like we had online earlier in the week, there at our table and could not make a decision. Everything looked very tasty. After asking our sever a few questions, we settled on the Bread Board complementing the Cod Chowder and Octopus appetizers and the Brown Butter Ravioli and Braised Lamb Neck as our main courses.  We have to start with the bread board, as the selection that night was 8 made-in-house fennel and black pepper biscuits served with warm butter and a sprinkling of salt and pepper on the side.  We both agreed the biscuits stole the show, even going beyond the \"homemade biscuits are always good\" saying.   Then came her Cod Chowder and my Octopus.  Both dishes were excellent and very tasty, drawing more praise from both of us.  My only slight criticisms are that I would have liked a little spice in the chowder and that the portion of Octopus served could have been a little bigger.  But the food was excellent in spite of those minor nitpicks.   Then our main courses -- her Brown Butter Ravioli and my Braised Lamb Neck came.  The Ravioli was very tasty and again drew praise from each of us on how the flavors worked together quite well.  But, much like the Cod Chowder, it seemed to be missing a little something, like a hint of pepper mixed in with the butternut squash.  It was my Lamb that drew the most praise since the Bread Board though, as the meat literally fell off the bone.  I've found at various other restaurants that phrase is conjecture and, at times, hyperbolic. Not the case with \"Or, The Whale\"'s  Braised Lamb.  Our server said it was her favorite dish on the menu, and from the first bite, I knew why.  The flavors, despite the lamb tasting a bit burnt in a couple places, of the meat paired excellently with the asparagus and risotto and I could really tell it was a dish the chef(s) at \"Or, The Whale\" had essentially perfected.   In summary, \"Or, The Whale\" is, in my opinion one of the better restaurants downtown, worthy of your time for a nice dinner.",

    "text": "I hesitated to try this place because the reviews were not fantastic, Then a friend said she had a very good meal there so I figured I'd give it a shot. First impressions, the space is beautiful, we were greeted right away and escorted to a cute little corner table on the second floor. Very comfortable, we were offered drinks and water promptly. It wasn't very crowded, the music selection was fun but not too loud so we could easily hear each other talk. Cocktails on the tiny side, as they tend to be at hipster kind of places. Wine pours are decent. The food is when it started to go downhill for me. I believe it was the first week of a new menu and they really haven't worked the kinks out yet. My octopus carpaccio arrived frozen. I cook, so I understood that they most likely had to freeze the octopus to slice it thinly, but it was downright unpleasant to eat. I called the server over and he graciously swept it away immediately, but by the time he replaced it my husband was finished with his appetizer, which was the tartare and he liked it, and about 50% of the octopus was still frozen. He took it off the bill. Also the octopus was covered with housemade crackers that weren't mentioned on the menu, and I specifically ordered it because it appeared to not have any bread as per the menu description. I really dislike wasting food, so if it had said on the menu that it had crackers I would've asked to leave them off. On to entrees, my husband ordered the whole fish which was deboned tableside. The runner did the best he could to debone it, but our table was small, the tiny side plate he used to pile up the bones didn't really hold them well and they were sliding all over the place, which was awkward. His fish was delicious but so full of bones that pretty much with every mouthful my husband was trying to be as discreet as possible pulling bones out of his mouth. As for me, I got the fish stew, which was tasty but the sauce was room temperature, a little too thick for a stew, and extremely awkward to eat as it was mostly full of shellfish so I had to reach in with my hands and remove the meat. I think this place has a lot of potential,The wood grilled vegetables we ordered for a side were absolutely delicious, addictive - I coukd eat them every day - But I also cannot understand why the seasonal vegetables in May were broccoli and cauliflower, as they harvest in the fall. The service was fantastic and our server was right on top of everything. But right now for me, Or The Whale is just OK.I",

    "text": "I know that people often have phrases that are extremely meaningful to them, but do we really need to name a restaurant after an obscure subtitle from Moby Dick?  Is that where we're at now?  I get it, the owners wanted to evoke thoughts of the sea even before customers arrive at their restaurant.  Yeah, righto!  Please stop with the esoteric names and menu notations when your excellent decor, food and service is enough to warrant a visit to your restaurant.  I do mean EXCELLENT service!  Our waiter was fabulous and couldn't have provided better service if he fed us our meals table side.  The menu is short and sweet, maybe a little too short, but they do almost everything extremely well. (I say almost everything because I tried to order the Best Chicken Sandwich You'll Have Today and they were out of various components needed to make the sandwich.  What?)  Since I couldn't order the chicken sandwich, I ordered the Eggs Chesapeake with 2 crab cakes, poached eggs, old bay hollandaise, housemade English muffins and farm greens($18). Yummy!  One of my lunch partners ordered the same as me along with a side of bacon($8) and my other lunch partner ordered the Steak + Eggs with two fried eggs, wood fired bavette, hearth roasted vegetables and fingerlings, chile hollandaise and chimichurri sauce.($25)  Now let me just say that those prices are just a little steep for lunch in Dahntahn Pittsburgh, but as far as restaurants associated with and placed in hotels, the prices were about par.  Additionally, that side of bacon was in a whole nother class by itself.  Damn, that bacon was good!  In spite of the lack of ingredients for the chicken sandwich, Or, the Whale is a nice spot to try for the food, ambiance and service.",

I parked in the garage next door. Walked in the side door and was pretty sure I was in the wrong place. No signs for the restaurant.  5. The night started with a drink at the  bar where the hipster bartender complained about Pittsburgh and was excited about his \"assignment ending\". Hopefully that means he's leaving town because WE, speaking for all  of PGH, love this town.  4. We had reservations. Oddly enough when we walked up to the hostess she didn't speak. She didn't say hello. She didn't ask if we had reservations. She looked at a book, nodded and took us downstairs. Maybe we were the only ones? Still confused about that one.....  3. The entire restaurant was empty except one table. We were seated right next to that table. Just the 2 parties in a big ol' space at the same table sharing the same bench....did I mention they had a child and it was her first birthday? How awesome for two old ladies who wanted to drink and cuss. Thanks hostess.... That was fun.......  2. I'm pretty sure the guy who brought us bread, took it, and served to another table and 39 seconds later served us our bread was high. Charming, but totally stoned.  1.  Finally, I thought I was double billed which was nearly $400...when I checked my statement I found that the waiter must not have liked the tip I gave him bc he increased it $10.   Also, managers, if you are reading this, please listen and don't complain that Yelp Elite pretentiousness has anything to do with it. Your staff needs training in the worst way.    PS $30 for a drink...the machine that made the drink was broken so I was supposed to get a discount....and...I didn't. Still waiting for those pending charges to come off my bank account!",

Menu was good , variety of options. I had their eggs Benedict with crab cakes and house made English muffins. Eggs were perfectly poached, crab cakes were delicate and English muffin was not overly dense. Ordered side of roasted fingerlings potatoes. Also good. Can't wait to try other dishes.",

    "text": "This brunch experience was terrible from start to finish.    With family visiting from overseas and local family members coming together, I wanted to find a neat, new place for Sunday brunch.  Through and article from Next Pittsburgh, I read about \"or, The Whale.\"  The menu items were limited, but I thought they offered something for everyone in our party of 11.  I was delighted that after first saying they were fully booked at my desired time, they said they had availability for us.    We were still 20 minutes out from our reservation time when I received a call from the restaurant asking if we were still coming.  Confused, I asked if I was late somehow and if I was supposed to have called to confirm.  The hostess stumbled through saying something like \"You didn't, but we called you to confirm, and you didn't confirm back.  It's all fine!\"  I never received a confirmation call or message after I made the reservation over the phone.  I even checked my phone to be sure I hadn't missed something.  I had not.  No matter.  We were on time, and our table was still available.   Actually, it was TWO tables.  They were side by side lengthwise, so we pulled them together.  The waitress came over and separated the tables again and said that they had to have space between the two to serve food.  I have eaten in dozens of restaurants -- many far more limited in space than this one -- where this was never an issue.  We would happily hand plates across or dowthe table or move aside to make room.  The tables aren't so big that a waitperson couldn't reach the other side.  More than anything, it was her approach that put us off.  \"This is how we do it\" was her attitude.  Period.  Okay, move on.  I ordered a Bloody Mary. I had not read the description and found that it was incredibly spicy! My bad. My sister asked, then, for just a V8 or tomato juice and vodka. All they have is the tomato juice infused with habanero that they use in the Bloody Mary. We were starting to see that maybe they didn't have a full bar. My cousin ordered an Aperitivo Spritz on my recommendation, having had many Aperol Spritzes in other restaurants. This drink tasted more like a cheap wine cooler than a decent cocktail. My father asked for something (I didn't hear what) that was not available. He then asked for San Pellegrino. The waitress said she would find out if they had that. She returned to say that they had sparkling water, only Badoit brand sparkling water. Why didn't she know that?  We were still eager to dig into the interesting menu, drink experience aside. \"Chowder of the Day\" is listed on the menu. When I asked, I was told that they didn't have that. They had \"only italian couscous.\" I had to press the waitress to confirm that \"italian couscous\" was their soup and not a side dish. She seemed indifferent. One member of our party wanted to order the poutine. She was told that they didn't have gravy, so it would include just hollandaise sauce. Gravy is a key part of poutine, so she passed. Instead, she ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup, one of the few items on the menu. We were told that they didn't have tomato soup, only the \"other soup.\" She and another member of our party then ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was dry, the waffles were bland, and the fried egg was as afterthought--the whites had been cut off such that there was only a yolk and a bit of white. From the looks of my husband's shrimp and grits (with fried eggs), his eggs had been scooped away from the same batch.  My daughter and I ordered Steak and Eggs, which was advertised as being served with roasted vegetables and fingerling potatoes. Neither plate included one potato bite. When we asked if the dish was to have included potatoes, the waitress said that the vegetables are usually a combination root vegetables and potatoes. Our \"root vegetables\" were summer squash, zucchini and broccoli with one or two pieces of turnip or carrot. The waitress said she could bring us a side of potatoes if we wanted \"more.\"  We had to ask for salt and pepper.  Note to the next diner: medium-rare is truly rare inside, not warm.  I didn't ask, so that's on me.  Everyone else said that their food was either not very satisfying or just \"meh.\"    At some point in the middle of the meal, the dining room suddenly smelled sharply of smoke.  We hoped it came from a wood-fired stove in the open kitchen.    Shortly after paying the bill, my sister started having intestinal cramps.  An hour later, my cousin texted to say that she was having diarrhea, as well. Two more diners have since come down with diarrhea.  Four separate meal orders, but somewhat suspicious. Will call the restaurant just in case.   The limited menu was very disappointing in its execution. The lack of a full-er service bar (alcoholic and non) was a surprise in a brunch restaurant. The service was indifferent AT BEST.  We will NOT return to or, The Whale.",

We went in at almost 1pm but they only had a brunch menu, if you have read my other reviews, I really don't like breakfast because I don't like eggs or sweet breakfasts. We originally asked to sit at the bar, we just wanted a quick bite and we usually prefer to sit at a bar, but they didn't have a bartender so we took the table they gave us. I really liked how comfy the booth half our table was, I appreciate my boyfriend giving that side to me. My boyfriend ordered french toast which he said were great, just hard to finish while battling a hangover. As I was twice as hungover and exhausted and already dislike breakfast I just ordered the soup of the day which was a salmon chowder. I have never had salmon chowder before this point, it was very good, very salty but good. I think if I were to visit again I would visit at night when they have their full menu, oysters and just in general a selection more my liking.",

This is all high-end, high-skill chef stuff and I don't think my man Chef Brooks can do any wrong. Enjoy this gem of a restaurant while you can. Next on the list is the 100+ day dry aged ribeye (seriously? Butchered and Dry-aged in-house no less!!). I've had other sampling's from the menu too, and the next time I'm disappointed will be the first.   Everyone needs to try the duck duck goose burger one time. Seared foie gras on top of duck confit on a ground duck patty. My question for Chef Brooks after my meal was \"are you f***ing kidding me with that!?\"  All the stars for Or the Whale.

Last week, was my first time that I was there for dinner, we decided on Or, The Whale as our PGH Restaurant Week destination (wish we could have done more but the week got away from us), anyways we went on Thursday and both my boyfriend and I got the three course restaurant week menu, I did the risotto and he did the chicken, both were excellent.

We got the shrimp and crab cocktail to start. The flavors were really good on the shrimp and crab. I wish there was enough horseradish in the cocktail sauce to taste. It didn't have any spice to it at all, but that's just my preference! I got the Caesar salad, which was good. Then my entree was the duck burger and it was amazing. I actually miss it. I asked the server to pair a red to the duck, and bring it out with the meal. She worked with the sommelier, brought out a syrah, and it paired perfectly. This meal was awesome and service was great, too!",

    "text": "Had an average brunch here, although I suspect that their dinner offerings are much stronger.  I do want to say that the restaurant itself is beautiful.  The entrance is upstairs and overlooks the downstairs dining area, with a stunning mural of a whale (Moby Dick?) against the back wall.  Tables and booths are located here, with an open kitchen to the right.  Really cool spot.  We only got a few items off of the menu, one being the Eggs Benny, and nothing really stood out.  The English muffin that came with the Eggs Benny wasn't toasted and didn't have much taste to it.  The ham was overly salty and thin, and I honestly had better at Eat 'n' Park.  I probably won't be back for brunch, but if you're someone who enjoys trying new places it's probably worth checking out at least once.   One odd thing that happened here was that my card was charged twice.  When I called up and advised Or, The Whale of the mistake, they said that because they are a \"high end\" restaurant, credit card companies charge it twice, the first time being a hold that gets lifted after a week, and the second time for the meal.  I still don't think I understand the reasoning behind this, as I can't remember this ever happening to me before.",

Service was excellent, we spent a lot of time talking after our meal since it was before the brunch rush and the servers were very attentive filling our waters. Highly recommending to any friends looking for a fancy brunch or visiting the Pittsburgh area!

    "text": "Or, The Whale... Or, try someplace else.  We all were excited for dinner, we all had high hopes, but our excitement died with each passing hour we sat around without service.  Our evening did start on a high note though - at the bar. Walking into the restaurant you're overtaken with the beauty of the whale mural and the creative ropes dangling over the bar. We were instantly greeted by a couple handsome bartenders that were eager to assist us and even paired some delicious rolls and a sweet butter with our brews.  Once the clock struck 7:45pm, it was time to take out table downstairs. Little did we know our evening should have remained at the bar with the helpful bar staff.  We sat about 20 minutes without any assistance. Finally we got the attention of the sommelier who also happened to be the manager. He graciously took our drink orders, but then we became confused if he would be assisting us this evening or if we actually had a server? We didn't have a server.  There had to be at least a half a dozen bus boys, but maybe 2 waitresses that dodged glances with us at all times. Aside from the sommelier, we didn't catch a single name of anyone there and we only got his name because he went to high school with my dinner guests.   After about an hour or so we finally got our appetizers. My friend and I shared a disappointing crab Mac n cheese that lacked flavor, lost all cheesiness from the penne noodles and only clumped crab in the corner of the dish. My other friend ordered the octopus and enjoyed it.  By the time we got the main course we had spent several hours of our lives there and not by choice. My friend and I shared the Duck, duck goose burger.  I don't think I've ever had a more overpriced and average dinner in my life. It was creative, but also dry and the bun just crumbled in my hand. The goose mayolike sauce did salvage some flavor, but it was far from worth $45... yep, you read that right.  I can honestly say I've had better burgers at Burgatory.   The one positive was the bday surprise the manager brought me. A creme brulee with wafers and a balloon topper. That was really sweet and the balloons were a nice touch.   Check time - more waiting. We waited at least another 20 min before we got the check and we only received the check after flagging someone down - again!   Btw- the check was incorrect.  Maybe it's because the restaurant is fairly new, but next time, if here is a next time - you'll find me at the bar.",

It has a beautiful ambience and excellent service- their hosts/waitresses are amicable and knowledgeable. Their menu is diverse- seafood and steak restaurant with a bit of twist.  We visited them for the first time for our anniversary dinner and they were so very friendly/excited for our occasion! I had their fish special, rainbow trout, and my husband had the seafood stew.  Both entrees were cooked flavorfully. However, their a la carte vegetable sides were somewhat undercooked although rich in flavor.  We had 1/2 dz oysters - they were also locally caught. They were fresh and delicious but I hope they will bring in west coast oysters to diversify their oyster options. This is considered a high-end restaurant and would come out to about $50-70/head.  However, the portions were huge and we did leave satisfied with lots of leftovers.  I am excited to go back there again- lots of interesting items on the menu to be had!",

    "text": "We went for brunch, and since they offer it every day, we figured it would be killer! I left feeling rather underwhelmed, but still curious on how a dinner would go there. We got the mussels and monkey bread for apps, and while the bread was great, the mussels were severely lacking. The white sauce that was found on the bottom of the pot was not even an inch deep, but it was tasty. Unfortunately, hardly any of the mussels touched the sauce to cook in & about 5 weren't even open, and the rest were very bland. The bread they gave us was puzzling, as it was drenched in butter, was NOT toasted at all, but had a few grill marks at one end that tasted like charcoal? Bizarre and really gross, actually. The server never questioned why nobody ate more than half the mussels or why after only one bite of bread nobody ate any more. We only had our apps for about 5 minutes before our entrees came out....which was rushed & weird but I was happy to be moving on from the mussels. 3 of us ordered the crab cake Benedict & 1 person had the Benedict with the ham, which his entire plate was cold. I felt bad because he was pretty turned off by that. All of our plates were warm, but I found their crab cakes to not have been cooked at all??? This was not a pleasant texture, I don't know what more to say. It was more like shredded crab in some sort of sauce with a LOT of seasoning. And then they put a poached egg on top but mine was a tad undercooked and flooded my entire plate. Everyone else's eggs seemed cooked just right, though. It did taste good, but it's not something I'd ever order from there again.    One positive thing about our experience was that one of the chefs was able to shuck us some oysters, which they typically only do for dinner. They were pretty yummy, although several of them were gritty and poorly shucked. But, he was likely in a hurry to squeeze us in, so I can understand that happening. I would consider coming here for a dinner sometime, but it's been bumped pretty far down on all of our lists at this point.",

    "text": "First, the setting is great. You walk in and feel like you're at a New England eatery by the coast.   Second, the bar upstairs, including the bartenders and selection of beers, liquor, and wine, are also great.   We then moved downstairs for our 7:45 dinner reservation for four people. Having heard nothing but good things, expectations were high.   We sat for approximately twenty minutes without anyone coming over to even ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Eventually we made eye contact with the sommelier, who also turned out to be the manager. He was kind enough to take our drink orders, especially as the waitresses (there were two by the way walking by us all night) ignored us seemingly on purpose.   About ten minutes later, after still no drinks, the manager came back to take our food orders, and serve us our drinks.   Another hour goes by, and we finally get out appetizers. I had the octopus, which had a good sauce, and was a solid 7/10. Two people split the Mac and cheese with crabmeat, which they both agreed was mediocre at best.   Another 40 minutes go by (still no wait staff and just the manager coming by every once in a while) and then we finally receive our main courses.  -1. Two of us got the bouillabaisse which was a special tonight. It was enjoyable, and for $30 was fairly priced for the quality.  -2. The two other people split the Duck burger. One of them enjoyed it fine enough, and the other wasn't impressed at all. They both agreed though that for $45, the quality of the bun, quantity of meat, and flavor of the fries, should all have been top notch. We've all had better at any number of the burger restaurants around Pittsburgh, for half the price and infinitely better service.   Suffice it to say, the food was a solid 5/10, and the atmosphere was a 7/10. The service however is probably some of the absolute worst I've ever had in Pittsburgh, and I've lived here for 28 years.   I wish I could recommend this place, as I had high hopes, but unfortunately, I can't say I'd ever go back based on this experience.",

First, I had the Tall Soarr Mimosa, it was very delish but, pretty strong. I then switched to a normal mimi! The coffee was super hot and smooth.  We wanted to order the monkey bread for an appetizer and he said they were all out :( so sad! I was so excited... I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, it was soooo amazing! Buttery and crispy and the soup was non acidic and hot! My husband had the fish and chips, the fries were so crispy and well flavored, ah mazzzing again! Boom!  Our friends had the savory waffle and wedge salad, they were very satisfied.  I would love to come back again!",

I referred to it as a \"fine establishment\" because the location is great. It's located inside a hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. I also appreciated the set up/decor of the restaurant. It's very unique. It has a nautical theme to mirror the name of the restaurant. The food and service were below my standards and will probably be below your standards too. You and I both want the best in life and we're not gonna get it here. Maybe you can help me figure out why a restaurant would refer to a dish as a \"savory waffle\" and then have the nerve to not season it. While they were occupied with NOT seasoning the dish, they also overcooked most of it.  After I was served my plate of unseasoned, overcooked food, someone important forgot to use their manners. I know better than to expect southern hospitality in a place like Pittsburgh but no matter where you go, you always expect a manager to show concern about an unsatisfied customer. And no, I did not pull a, \"can I speak to your manager\". The manager actually came to me and asked me what I thought about the food. I explained that even though I already ate most of it, the majority of the dish was overcooked. He reacted by chuckling and saying, \"oh\". I didn't know how to respond to his lack of a response so I just sat there. Akward! That was the first and last time I sat in the fine establishment.",

    "text": "It pains me to have to write a bad review of this place. This has been at the top of my list for a while now and I was so excited to try it out. I was extra excited when I saw they had a restaurant week special and immediately made a reservation. Sadly, it was disappointing.  After waiting 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive our waitress came over to notify us that the soup my friend ordered wasn't ready yet and it would be a few minutes longer. She proceeded to ask if there was anything else she could get us in the meantime and we asked if they offer any bread for the tables. She told us she would check but never returned to let us know. Our appetizers did finally come and my friend said the soup was delicious. My caesar salad was a little disappointing but I'm also very picky about my caesar salad.  For the entree we both went with the burger. They mistakenly put my friends well done burger on my plate with my salad and put my medium burger on her plate with her fries. After spending nearly an hour already I decided to just eat it because I didn't have the time to wait for a new burger to be prepared. My friend did end up sending her burger back to be cooked more. When it was returned the guy didn't even apologize for the inconvenience which I thought was weird. People like their meats prepared very differently and if you don't get it right it will completely sway the persons opinion of the dish. I personally think anything above medium makes a burger relatively tasteless and you might as well give me a leftover burger from the day before because it tastes about the same.    While my experience was not that great, I was very happy when they gave us half off our meal for the inconvenience. I thought it was a very nice gesture after what had happened. While I'm not really in a rush to hurry back I would still like to try their eggs benedict for brunch one of these days.",

You'd never guess such a beautiful lobby and restaurant are hidden inside. But as soon as you walk through the doors of or, the whale, the atmosphere immediately surrounds you from the lights, to the open kitchen, to the giant mural, to the tables and chairs ... the attention to detail and style is so enjoyable. Every staff member we interacted with was helpful and kind.   If I can recommend anything, it's the monkey bread. We split it as an appetizer to our brunch and it was the best part of my day. So delicious! We also tried the eggs Benedict, the eggs Chesapeake, the chicken salad on a croissant, and the savory bubble waffle. It was all very good. The homemade English muffins for the egg dishes made the meal so tasty!   What a great addition for brunch to the city!",

This venue is perfect for any event need. The lounge gave us a space that was perfect for the party feeling we wanted for our guests. The roof top area provided a beautiful space that left us with spectacular pictures. A big thank you to the staff at Or, The Whale!",

    "text": "Was it the clothes we were wearing, or perhaps the exhaustion on the faces of the two hard-working professionals and parents of two? Was it something we said? It's never a good feeling to leave a nice restaurant wondering what we had done to earn the disdain of the staff. I will swallow my pride, confusion, and emotion as I try to objectively review this restaurant.  Front of house: two stars Despite reserving ahead and the house not being full, we were made to wait for our table, which turned out to be a backwater two-top in a forgotten corner, next to a larger more boisterous party.  Decor and ambiance: four stars The large mural of a whale, the nautical themes and federal-chic interior, and the old-book-style menus were nice touches, to be sure.  Service: one star, if that. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Sure, it was a Sunday night. But this was the night we had chosen to have the in-laws watch our kids and make it out for an evening. I felt put-upon, like I was inconveniencing our waiter with our presence. The service was lackluster and took the wind from our sails. We were not even offered a description of the soup of the day. I was given the wrong wine (more expensive than what I had ordered) and charged for it--the audacity! The subsequent sip-pour of the wine  I had intended to drink was too little too late. Our waiter and server/busser were lackluster milksops with no strong opinions about the menu that they were willing to share with us.   To make matters worse, I know they can do better, because I watched them do so for our neighbors.  Food: 3-4 stars (by dish)  Cheese plate: blue cheese chocolate truffles may have been trendy in 2005, but they are passe. Even in the heyday of the chocolate-and-fungus rage, one had to walk the razor's edge of flavor choices. Inartfully drizzling some Roquefort with congealed fudge can at times manage to accentuate the less-than-desirable notes in two otherwise-pleasant ingredients. One seldom aspires to serving a cheese tray redolent of an old shoe filled with spent coffee grounds. The other cheeses were wholly adequate and reasonably paired.  Mussels: they weren't sandy, and we competently prepared. They may not have been terribly memorable, but they were tasty. The charred baguette was a nice touch.  Carrots: for 9 bucks a plate, one could have been more imaginative than simply roasting them with a side of grilled lemon. tasty though.  Pork chop: sous vide with a nice reverse sear, this was a good piece of meat with a nice presentation.  Soup: butternut squash with curry. It was ok, but lacked soul. I blame an insufficiently-bodied stock.  Crab Mac n cheese: delicious, but of course it was. It's crab Mac n cheese. One bit-picky point: a pasta shape more interesting than ziti would have felt more special.  Value: 1 Star. In this city, better meals can be had for half the price.",

Our waiter was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. They have a great cocktail list and also a lot of beer and wine choices. The menu is cool, it's broken up into chapters. We started with the bread and olives, the latter were fantastic. Another person I was with had the oysters and said they were very good. My entree was the wood plank salmon, the veggies that came with it were excellent but my only hiccup with this place was that the salmon was undercooked, not sure if that was intentional. We ended with the fruit tart, also great. Would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

    "text": "I wish that I had had more time in PITT just so that I could have returned to Or, The Whale to try several more rounds of their technically savvy and creative, artful, sea & French fare food. Let's begin with the atmosphere - to quote Zagat \"Set in the refurbished gymnasium of a historic Salvation Army building, this Downtown French prepares locally driven, sustainable ingredients over a wood-fired grill, with a global wine list, craft beers and handcrafted cocktails. Hanging ropes and a large mural of a whale and a ship add to the subtle nautical theme of the contemporary space.\" This space was something really special. It felt like an enchanted, soft place in my heart that I had not yet discovered.   The food here is really quite remarkable. The chefs have all been culinary school trained, and this made apparent by the audacious execution of each fine detail in each dish. Each dish is properly and expertly elevated. The flavors all balanced and technically mounted. I was beyond impressed with the thoughtful design of each plate. The fresh-baked and sometimes perfectly grilled bread cannot be left out. The bread came on an inviting wooden board with a fresh spread of sea salt and pepper to blend at one's own discernment with a thick swab of butter. The salmon succotash and the fish stew are a joy to the pallet. Both are beautifully and artfully crafted to articulate the flavors of farm and sea. Wood-fired steaks & sustainable seafood is what this place boasts. We also had the oysters Rockefeller, which gave way to smokey, wood-fired char and thick cut bacon. The brine was beautifully blended with a soft butter sauce. A must try. Anyone would be happy with a meal here. Also the service is extremely personal, attentive and constant. This place is truly world class.",

    "text": "I have driven past this place so many times and I always said I wanted to try it, so finally tonight, I did. I was extremely pleased!   The first thing you notice about this place is the decor. It has the Nantucket, on the sea feel. From the ropes and netting to the wallpaper, the decor matched the theme and food. The lighting is dim but not too dim so that you can't see.   I sat at the bar and my service was great! The girls at the bar were very attentive and greeted me the moment I sat down. I got my food quickly. I didn't have a drink, however, but it looked like they had an array of liquor and made pretty unique drinks.   I ordered the wedge- which came in a very large bowl. It sort of felt unnecessary but it didn't matter once I started to dig in. The thick cut bacon was a delicious match to the cheese and the buttermilk ranch they use. It tasted homemade and they also made it special by adding dill. I also loved the pickled onions, that really made this salad over the top for me. This could've been a meal itself, honestly. It was lovely.   For my main dish I had the half of chicken and the crab Mac and cheese. It was really delicious. The mustard chicken jus and lemon paired together so nicely with the chicken, as well as the endives and even the raviolo. It was very lemony but not overpowering and I love that. The skin on the chicken was crispy and the chicken itself was moist. I loved the endive, especially the crunch and char on it. The crab Mac was crunchy and creamy and everything a Mac should be. It had big chunks of crab and a good crab taste. So so good.   What I ordered was A LOT of food. I didn't realize the portions were going to be so big. I definitely have another meal or two left.   Although prices are a bit steep here, the food is quality and definitely worth it. I would eat here compared to other high end restaurants down town.",

    "text": "We made reservations for a Friday night on a Thursday that put us in the later box, which we expected. I called because we were unsure of our parking situation and were helped graciously.  Loved the downstairs feel of dining next to the kitchen, which gave me a view of what was happening, that comes in later.   This restaurant, to me, is about the fresh seafood and presentation of a dish with minimal touch in the sense of over cooking or seasoning. With that I so want to give a 4, solely on the broccoli side I was dire for on this day of my own bad eating choices, yet the view I just mentioned cleared it to 5.   Very few places that offer fish (offer key word, not specialized) in Pittsburgh actually go out of their way to ensure it is fresh. I have yet to go to a fish specific place that's awful in this town. If anyone complains about the price online you clearly need to cool it and check their online menu to see if it's going to ruin the taste in your mouth.  If you haven't crossed a bridge and had fresh seafood near a shore, then you don't know what you're paying for anyways.   I would recommend Or, The Whale to whomever enjoys fresh plates from the sea.   Our waiter was wonderful with suggestions on the menu, quick to fill glasses paid and freely provided, plus 'food servers' to us who also seemed to be waiting on others upstairs were attentive and friendly while tending our table as well. When we left there were thank you and good nights.   Our server made a fine recommendation to do 1/2 of each the chef and featured oysters which was grand and I could tell the difference in the varieties. The chowder was made and presented the way I like soups; base and bits separately cooked then combined the way Grandma's do, scallops delectable with a sugary fry top, Mac and crabby cheese very crabby (seriously if you're irritated on the type of noodle you've missed the shell on this) and then the mashed potatoes with chili oil with lemon zest? Couldn't put my pinky in that last flavor yet mysteriously delicious.  Back to the view, for the broccoli, could see a hand held propane flame which is regularly used in kitchens being 'instructed' with three or so chefs at the hot shelf before our last plates came out.   Broccoli was scorched. We like charred, him more than me, yet I don't know anyone who doesn't get broccoli bits in their teeth blanched or boiled... so the charr on this was inarguably worrisome prior to going to the very nice lobby bathrooms. Didn't want to speak to anyone before I got there, yet more so wanted fresher vegetables.   We came for the fresh seafood though, and based on the view, think oTW will get it right for the rest of you. This is a place we'll be able to return to on an occasion.   So, my only suggestion is... toothpicks if you come here for green vegetables. Unless you take your server's recommendation on carrots. Probably just stick with the seafood though.",

We had heard good things and expected to like the place. Unfortunately every thing besides Erik and the wine were either disappointing, mediocre, or awful. The best things to order seem to be the oysters or the cod chowder but the radishes were swimming in salty liver mousse and the the linguine with cockles were so salty as to be inedible!!! And while my husband said the scallop entree was good, at $30 he certainly expected more than 3 scallops on the plate. With so many other places to get great oysters in Pittsburgh these days there is no reason to come back. Save yourself the trip and go to Union Standard or Muddy Waters or Poulet Blue.",

She gives us a nice welcome speech about where the bathroom is and the weather. We get to the table and she realizes it is not ready and we have to turn around and go back up the stairs and wait- which is fine, but weird and slightly disorganized. We are waiting for 10 minutes when we see another couple get seated at the table that was being prepared for us. The hostess comes back and asks what my name is because she forgot and didn't think to check her list. We walk to our table and get the same welcome speech we received 15 minutes ago as if it never happened. We ordered the escargot that was fine and the guppy tower to split. There were no utensils given to us for seafood (the mini forks and mini spoons) so we poured the sauce and vinegar onto our oysters. It was impossible to get the meat out of the clams- the clams that even had meat! Some basically were just full of salt water. We ordered the banana cake for dessert and two espressos. We got our cake, which was ok...but did not get our espressos (which showed up as Americanos in tea cups) until 10 minutes after we got our cake. For a $180 meal between two people...I expected much better!",

Our table had 2 strip steaks, a duck burger and rack of lamb.  The temperatures were unacceptable on 3 of the 4 meals.  The duck burger was raw and not edible.  The rack of lamb was to be medium, one of which was cooked to the correct temperature, but the other was extremely rare.  One of the strip steaks was over-cooked, the last was cooked perfectly.  I have a much broader tolerance for temperature variation when food is prepared on a woodfired grill where temperatures vary greatly and precision is not possible, but they missed the mark by more than a few degrees.  Raw food can never get a free pass no matter how it is cooked (or not cooked).  The bread was outstanding. Excellent flavor and moistness throughout.  The escargot and the shrimp and crab appetizers were also well prepared and perfectly cooked.  The crab was especially exceptional.  Lastly, we were a bit surprised to learn when receiving our check that our iced tea was charged per glass. We're talking regular, nothing special, plain old iced tea.  I'm ok being nickle and dimed if I am getting wowed in the process, the only wow here was $21 for iced tea, really? So all in all, I would give them one last try to see if I caught them on a bad day, but one more meal like the one we just had and they will be off the list for good.",

    "text": "Tonight I had the absolute pleasure of sharing a meal with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday (today) and my birthday (tomorrow). My brother has severe nut allergies and I am vegan and gluten free. We're not the most convenient people to cook for because of our dietary restrictions. While my mother made the reservation, she let the restaurant know of their upcoming culinary challenge. As someone who has grown accustomed to ordering the vegetable side and a salad, I was not anticipating a specialized course from this farm to table chophouse and seafood restaurant. However, the chef actually emailed my mother prior to our visit. Before even coming to the restaurant, I felt welcomed. Chef Erik Bates came out to greet me as my specialized entree was being presented. He prepared a beautiful dish - curried chickpeas, roasted onions/fennel/fingerling potatoes, topped with pea shoots and cashews. He made his own curry blend. All of it rested on perfectly cooked red quinoa. Besides being an aesthetic masterpiece, it was so fragrant. I tasted the dish and had tears well up in my eyes. I'm not used to eating something so thought out at a restaurant that does not specialize in vegan cuisine. Every meat eater at the table (minus my nut allergic brother) tasted my meal. Each had seconds or thirds. I highfived the chef. Every single member of our party was unbelievably satisfied with their meals. Please try this place - you won't regret it. Hats off to the chefs for a wonderful culinary experience. They have something extremely special going on.",

    "text": "We visited Or, The Whale for weekend brunch. The place is absolutely beautiful, with a two level dining room, amazing Moby Dick mural, and many small decorative whaling/literary touches. The staff was also extremely welcoming and professional--both the host and our waitress went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful during our visit. The menu was diverse and interesting and the ingredients of all of the dishes were clearly fresh and carefully sourced.   Unfortunately, the food didn't go down quite as whale as it could have. We found all of the food pretty underseasoned. I don't think the brunch steak had any salt on it at all, although it was perfectly cooked, so it was very bland. Most of our dishes were on the room temperature side and they didn't all arrive at the same time, so by the time I started eating my dish, the savory bubble waffle, it was barely warm. Aside from the temperature issues, it was generally a pretty good dish. I liked the slight sweetness of the corn waffle and the bubble texture of the waffle was great. The mix of hollandaise and maple syrup was a little weird over the top.   The bacon was really excellent, a bit chewy and slightly sweet, with all the fat rendered nicely. The monkey bread, which sounds great, was pretty much a disaster. The sweet glaze was grainy and just kinda slopped into the middle of the roll and the center of the bread was completely raw dough.   Generally, it was a totally fine meal, but there was nothing really spectacular about the food. If I were staying in the hotel, I'd go again, but we probably won't be back.",

For our entrees, I ordered a fish stew, which contained shrimp, clams, mussels, and scallops in tomato sauce (not really a broth), and my husband ordered a steak, which was cooked to his preference. The restaurant has room for improvement with its bread, which cost $4 and tasted too peppery, and its fruit tart, which should skip the sunflower seeds. Overall, the service was very good, and the food was good--but NOT good enough to warrant the $150 bill, which included a tip for the waiter but no charges for drinks because we drank only water.",

My group had dinner at 7:30, but two of the dishes we attempted to order, they were out of for the evening. We started with the mussels, but unfortunately they lacked flavor and did not come with nearly enough sauce.Next I had the pickled shrimp bisque, which ended up being the highlight of my meal. This soup was full of flavor and had a nice spicy kick to it. For my main course I had the En Papillote, which was a flounder. The fish was cooked to perfection, but again lacked flavor - even salt would have bumped this dish up a notch in my book. Lastly, we finished with the creme brulee - which is well worth it.  I will not be headed back in the near future, but I am hopeful that this restaurant turns it around because I feel that the potential is there.",

    "text": "I was thinking to myself: Chef Dennis Marron might have a few things in common with Herman Melville, the American novelist who wrote \"Moby-Dick; or The Whale\".  *One thing would be the degree of detail both men employ in their craft. Melville was known for his intensely passionate and detailed prose about whales. Chef Dennis and his team think through EVERY detail of the WHOLE dining experience, beyond the food. The color scheme in everything--walls, seats, pillows even the dishware feels calming and peaceful as a day on the boat. The roped hoisting lines on the ceiling and the open kitchen that resembles a ship galley--pretty cool. And you just can't overlook the purposely tattered book menus and \"torn/worn\" book pages that accompany the plated dishes. How about the serving staff --- all tatt'ed and bearded and gorgeous in those merchant uniforms? (heart eyed emoji here) Even the friggin' striped paper drinking straws--adorable and biodegradable!  *Second commonality, both men experimented with \"form.\"  Melville brought his central story of his revenge on the white whale to a screeching halt so that he could instead profusely lecture on the anatomy of whales. Chef Dennis wrote his own modern story by boldly telling a city known for its deep loyalty to Heinz ketchup that, um, he will make you fall madly for his OWN housemade ketchup. (Just order his frittes and you'll see.) No matter what you order here, you'll note that like any great Chef, Marron took what he already knew would work in a seafood/steakhouse restaurant and boldly challenged it--moving beyond it. I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here in the last 2 months. The details he brought to the food at OTW are just as swoon-worthy as his restaurant experience. I've had incredible scallops. Shitake gnocchi. A buttermilk wedge salad. Eggs Chesapeake. And the Shakshuka. (dear God, so good!) And there's so much more on this menu I can't wait to taste. *Lastly, for me, I think Marron and Melville both share an authenticity that shines through their art. Both deeply passionate. Both deeply knowledgable and interested in their subject. Both enthusiastic, imaginative and brave. I really liked what he did when he introduced The Commoner. But I LOVE  or, The Whale.",

I was nervous because the commoner is overpriced for the quality/taste of the food, but Or, the whale was fantastic. The cocktail I ordered , La Bouttanierre?, was deeeee-licious. It was vodka and lemon based, but not too sweet. My friend ordered some version of an old fashioned with whiskey and rum, which was also a great choice. We had the octopus appetizer and I'm beginning to forget that my awful octopus experience (rubbery and flavorless) at Tako ever happened. I would absolutely recommend the octopus appetizer, but there were so many other options that I have to go back to try. My main course was the short rib. It had great flavor and I loved the little sour cherry things that came with it. It just had a little too much sear on the outside, but the inside was tender and moist. We also warily shared a side of crab Mac n cheese despite a bad Mac dish at the commoner, but it was great! The crab chunks were generous, the crab and cheese flavor were excellent. The best part was a chocolate hazelnut slice of birthday cake at the end of the dinner.  it was an added bonus to the already attentive and hospitable service. We will definitely return. Four stars is because of the prices. I get it, but oy.... It's Pittsburgh. Let's keep it livable",

I'm not reviewing the meal or dining experience itself because it was all overshadowed by my experience calling the restaurant to dispute a charge on my debit card. According to PNC, the restaurant charged us the original amount (before tip) that night. The next day they charged us a 2nd time with the tip added. Called the restaurant to dispute the 1st charge. The host answered. I said I was double charged for a meal the other night and would like to speak to a manager. He said very casually \"Oh that happens all the time. That's just something that happens with how our system processes charges.\" \"It just does that with certain banks for some reason.\" He said that it happens \"every 30 transactions or so. It should come off in 3 or 4 days.\" He clearly thought that was the end of the discussion. He then asked \"Did you still want to talk to a manager?\" I did. I didn't get the manager's name. He explained that the problem only happens occasionally. I said \"Both you and the host immediately knew what I was talking about and both treated it incredibly casually. So it sounds like this happens somewhat frequently.\" He said it only happens every \"60, 70 or 80 transactions\" and that the charge would come off in a couple days. I said that didn't work for me. That I can't afford to just have that money hanging in limbo for an unknown number of days. He blamed it on the small payment processing company they use. He at no point said he would do anything to remedy the situation. So I asked for the name of the small processing company. He sounded annoyed and said \"Cayan\" (I later Googled them. One of the biggest in the industry. Valued at over $1 billion. A real Mom & Pop outfit.) I said \"Ok, so you're not going to do anything. That's cool. I guess I'll call Cayan.\" He said \"I never said I wasn't going to do anything.\" To which I replied \"You never said you *were* going to do anything either.\" He said PNC bank has a merchant number he can call and immediately remove the charge when this happens. I pointed out that it was Sunday and the next day was a bank holiday. He said he'd call immediately and if that didn't work he'd call on Monday and Tuesday and call me back when it was taken care of. Tuesday at Noon I called PNC and it had not been removed. They said both charges were still pending and the restaurant would have to call and cancel it. Called the restaurant again. Got a manager named Bill. He told me this happens all the time, everywhere. He said he's \"been in the industry for 30 years and this happens everywhere, it's not just us.\" I said I have been eating in restaurants for 30 years and I've never heard of this happening. He said there's nothing to be done, the charge won't go through, it'll be taken off in 2 or 3 days. I said \"The manager I spoke to 2 days ago said he could call PNC and remove it immediately.\" He did not address this point but instead said \"This happens all the time and nobody has ever complained.\" I said perhaps the average customer at this particular restaurant isn't bothered by a couple hundred dollars, but that's a lot of money for my family. He said that they run the initial charge to ensure the person has sufficient funds before running it again with the tip added. I said that was absurd. I expressed concern that this unauthorized several-days hold on the money could lead to an overdraft. He then told me \"Sir, I can't help it if you don't make good decisions and mishandle your finances.\" Yes. Bill, the manager of Or, The Whale implied that this was my fault. My fault for not being comfortable being charged 200% for my meal without warning. For being too poor for his restaurant. For complaining about the phantom charge that he claims happens at every restaurant, everywhere, every day. He said \"I've been in this industry for 30 years and you're the first person who has ever called in angry and irate about this.\" I pointed out that none of the 3 people I spoke  to expressed any concern or took any responsibility for the ordeal. He said \"Like I said before, I am concerned.\" (He hadn't said it before.) \"And like I said before, I am sorry this happened.\" (He hadn't said that before either.) I asked \"Do you think I am getting any sense of concern or apology from your tone or from anything you've said?\" To which he perplexingly responded \"Sir, I'm not going to get personal with you.\" Wha? He said there was nothing to be done. The charge will come off in a day or 2. It didn't. In fact, the amount of the initial charge somehow changed. It is now the 22nd. One of the charges went through, the other is still pending. I called the restaurant again tonight and asked to speak to a manager and explained why I was calling. No manager was available. Meanwhile, my money is unavailable to me for a over a week because of this place and they made it very clear that they simply do not care.",

    "text": "You don't have read Moby Dick to enjoy this book themed restaurant...though you will appreciate the chapter menu! While a little pricey, the food is well executed and well worth the price of admission. Skim the Loomings and Chowder chapters to select an appetizer; their rich and flavorful cod chowder stood out thanks to the potatoes, bacon and leeks. If you're going with the theme, definitely make a selection from the Nantucket chapter. Here, we've enjoyed the linguini & cockles and the woodfired monkfish. Subsequent chapters include seafood towers for sharing and other proteins like steaks 'n chops. Some time I'd like to splurge and share the whopping 45-oz. Porterhouse! There's nothing like quality meat cooked on an open, woodfired grill. But, the heritage pork chop was a solid offering. One of my favorite sides is the grilled broccoli. Its oh-so-simple in preparation yet it explodes with flavor -- don't forget to use the seared lemon! Lastly, it's a very unique and inviting space. And service was impeccable. So just go...it's perfect for your next special occasion. Or better yet, check it out during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.",

    "text": "I've visited Or, the Whale for brunch multiple times and every visit has not disappointed.   It's my personal downtown favorite due to the large open, airy space and typically short wait since it's located on the other side of the town (Blvd of the Allies + Grant Street) to the cultural district. There has always been a seat when I visit (usually 10AM on weekends or 11:30 with co-workers on weekdays)   Every time the service is impeccable. Quickly seated, quick to fill any drink orders, and quick to bring out our orders.   I have had:   The Savory Bubble Waffle (had once) with fried egg, potatoes, homemade sausage, and smoked bacon.  All of it covered in a very buttery hollandaise sauce. The waffle is raised (as opposed to waffles with little pockets) cornbread, making it easy to cut off one and have a bite with sausage or bacon. A little on the heavy side, but very filling and good for a hangover ;)   Shakshuka (had 3 times) - A generous amount of herbed tomato sauce (menu says: pepper ragout, leek carrot fennel), with two dropped in baked eggs, and a large heap of pita-like bread (chapati - Indian style flat bread).   Eggs Chesapeake (had once) - GIANT English Muffins topped with full crab meat crab cakes (not the ones with just filler and breadcrumbs, this is the real deal) and poached eggs, smothered in a hollandaise sauce. I think there was a little too much sauce, so I scraped some off, but still yummy. There's a small serving of salad which helps balance the meal out. I had to take the second one home.    Hoping the Gingerbread sweet waffle comes back in the winter (has apples and spiced whipped cream) - my favorite seasonal item.   Not a fan: the roast chicken sandwich (topped with arugula and comes with a au jus sauce). It's off the menu now, so hopefully it doesn't come back.   Bonus:  the ambiance is Moby Dick theme, so everything is very nautical and cozy. The menus are organized like a chapter book!   Pro Tip: Bathrooms are in the hotel lobby. You need to exit the restaurant on the second floor (street level) to enter the lobby.",

The Bartender - Nami - could not have been nicer. In  this day and age of everyone face down mesmerized by their phones, she was attentive and engaging to everyone. When I asked for recommendations, she was cocksure with the Cod Chowder.  Oh the Cod chowder!  Perfectly roasted cod - crispy and flavorful but not fishy. Over a top of chunk bacon and mushroom surrounded by chowder with topping of onion straws. It could be an entree  I paired the soup with their wedge salad. Again this could have been an entree as it was a wedge enough for four people. What a combination! Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, chunks of bacon and housemade dressing.  Truly a beautiful and flavorful dish.  To quote the bartender when training a new person: \"any cocktail served her should be Instagramable\". They have 8 specialty cocktails and I watched all of them being made with exquisite care. They might range from $11-$18 l, but they are all works of art and I am happy to Yelp about two of them: the Black Pearl and the Garden Party.  I am not CAPRICIOUS with compliments - especially on Yelp -  but their ingredients are wonderfully sourced. Blue cheese from Vermont. Smoked bacon that is to die for... House made dressing and pickled red onions on the wedge salad made the meal for me.",

It is smaller, but this along with the sea-like decor make for a really unique eating experience.  I had heard great things about the oTW Burger and fish and chips, so it was a tough decision.  I went with the burger and could not have been happier.  This was a very thick and juicy burger.  It was cooked perfectly.  The meat was a ground of rib eye which made for a really beefy and fresh flavor.  With a burger this thick, an equally large bun was needed.  It was perfectly toasted and held up to the burger, sauce, and toppings.  The rest of my party had the fish and chips, eggs Benedict, and the American breakfast.  All were very happy with their choices.  Will definitely be back to try some more of their options.",

    "text": "For the price I am not impressed, actually I was very nauseated, or say \"sea sick\" like after eating at Or, The Whale.    We made reservations for brunch on a Sunday.  There was no free parking nearby so we got a spot in the garage right next to the hotel for $6.00. When we walked in we were greeted and seated in the middle of what essentially is the lobby of the hotel.  The atmosphere was unusual for a dining experience but the hotel was very classy so it seemed to work ok.  Our server was very nice but slow and the slowness seemed to be on purpose as if we were spending hours there like one might for a special dinner.  I ordered a coffee which was average and decided upon the Eggs Benny, Chesapeake style with crab instead of ham.  For the $18.00 price tag I was looking forward to some amazing eggs benny.  Unsuitably, this would not be the case.  After a longer than anticipated wait, our food was served.  My dish looked a little sparse.  There was a handful of salad greens on the plate that seemed dressed with water, no joke.  At the other end was my eggs.  Now unbeknownst to me under the scant layer of sauce sat an undercooked egg.  Not the kind that has a nice runny gooey yellow center.  No I mean the kind that has a snotty look and texture with a cooler very runny center.  I took a bite before I could tell this.  It was unappealing but I thought maybe I was making too much of it, that I like runny yoke poached eggs and these were just a little under.  While I kept eating I felt my stomach flop and then start to ache.  I should have sent them back but I didn't and regrettably I lived with the consequences of that decision for several hours to follow.  My husband however loved his food, but I can't think of a reason to return.  Nothing about my experience was worth reliving.  Oh they do have a lovely bathroom in the lobby for restaurant guests.  I should know I spent a good amount of time there after I gave up on my meal.",

During our meal, we all commented that the steak seemed a bit small, given we've tried these type of steaks at other places before. I should note here that the cocktails were fantastic. Anyways, our bill came and since we were in a hurry we didn't initially ask about the steak size. I noticed our mushrooms never arrived and the waiter kind of caught my eye as I was looking over the receipt to see if we were charged. While looking at the itemized receipt I took notice the steak said it was 42oz. A significant difference from what we ordered especially given there was four of us.  So he stops over and asks if everything was alright. I said yes, but that the steak seemed seemed small and I noticed the size was wrong on the receipt. He said \"oh yeahhh...I noticed that but assumed it was a typo!\" Da hell? You noticed it but didn't investigate it until I said something? So he runs back to the kitchen and came back and goes \"yeah apparently they changed the offering a few months ago. Would you like us to knock a few bucks off the receipt or do you want free drink coupons?\" A little annoyed we were going to be late for our concert we accepted the drink coupons (which are for 8 dollars and don't even cover cocktails...lame). Get your act together. Money wasn't the issue, it was the fact we all left hungry and it could have been avoided if it didn't seem like they were hoping we didn't notice when we ordered the food and would get away with it. Lame. Could have been a 4-5.",

The flatbreads were nicely spiced.  Only two critiques: 1. The sauce was very very thin, it would have been 5 star if the sauce was a bit more hearty and tomatoey. 2. The flatbreads soaked up NONE of the sauce! They were so dense and thin, so you end up folding the bread and basically scooping up the sauce like a spoon.

SWEET BUBBLE WAFFLE ($12): This was some crazy fiesta on my plate of fruits and whipped cream and syrup. I do wish that they had the maple syrup on the side though, the waffle could've gotten soggy so I had to eat a bit faster than normal (I'm a slow eater, lol). I would like to try the savory bubble or chef's breakfast next time!  One thing I didn't like was the lighting. It was really dark inside although it was around 1PM. I thought that there would be some more natural lighting but the restaurant is down some stairs, with the front doors being quite a bit far, not allowing a lot of light (hence my dark photo).",

I was surprised there weren't as many seafood items on the menu for it being a fish restaurant!  We ordered the oysters Rockefeller and they were the most delicious way of oysters I've ever had. Free bread or biscuits or something would have been great but nope. Our waiter was not very responsive but some of the others were very friendly.   I did like that the bathrooms were super clean, nice and in a completely separate area. For an impatient 15-mo baby, that proved to be a good place for a breather. Oh yeah, there was no sign for the restaurant and I had no idea it was inside a hotel. No street parking either so we had to pay to get in this tiny lot next door. Please make the sign visible for guests!",

More importantly, there is a good selection of fun food options. My quick breakdown: - Yes to the monkey bread! - Fries had a delicious homemade ketchup. - Steak and eggs over the savory waffle (but if you can, get both :)). I say this because the steak was just cooked so perfectly and my sweet tooth just craved for a fluffy sweet waffle. But that being said, the savory waffle was still tasty, just denser than a fluffy belgian waffle, and the sausage served with the waffle was the standout.",

    "text": "We made brunch reservations here for a Sunday afternoon at 1pm.  We took the parkway getting here and got off at the Grant street exit and it's right there on the corner.  I drove around and found a parking garage right next to the hotel that this restaurant is in for $6.  You go to the front of the hotel and walk in.  Once you walk in their hostess for the restaurant is to your right.  We were greeted and took a walk downstairs to our table.       We got our seats in the middle of the floor which wasn't too bad.  The area is a little different.  You almost feel like your in the middle of a big hotel lobby but it wasn't bad.         We had already looked through their brunch menu but I still wasn't sure what I wanted still.  I was really hungry and we were going to go for drinks after so I wanted to make sure I was full.  I looked through pictures on Yelp and finally decided on the Savory Waffle.  The waitress describe it to me and with my wife's encouragement I went with it.       We both ordered waters and my wife got a coffee which was just ok.  Carrie got the eggs benny and it looked good.  The problem was that the eggs were underdone.  They looked ok at first but once she ate it she could tell they were a little under.  We should have had them redo the eggs when we noticed but we didn't. So that was disappointing but my savory waffles were awesome!  I was thinking it might be sweet but I didn't want something sweet.  I just wanted a lot of food.  It wasn't sweet because the waffle was made out of cornmeal and there was just a light maple sauce.  The waffle, sausage, eggs, bacon all came together so beautifully.  I loved it and it hit the spot.         So overall a decent brunch but it would have been really good if my wife's eggs were cooked better.  Also the service was really good I thought too.  Our waitress did a good job taking care of us.",

We started in the bar section and I got one of their signature drinks with bourbon.  it was nice, albeit a bit strong.  I followed it up with a cosmo which I don't think anyone has ordered in like 15 years, but they did a great job.  My third drink was a flirtini and I had to explain how to make it and they were spot on.  Props for making a drink on the fly to the bartending staff.  I ended the evening with a decaf coffee which I was not impressed with.  Not sure what was wrong with it, but it just didn't taste right.  For starters, we had the Hollywood oysters.  I hadn't ever heard of this type before, but the waitress's explanation of briney with a cucumber finish was precise.  I then had the cod chowder.  The broth is mixed in at the table and was outstanding.  Fingerling potatoes and a lovely piece of cod finished it off.  Zach got the wedge salad which was excellent but came in this ridiculously large wooden bowl.  I get it, it was cute, but way too big.  I then had the cockles and linguine.  I would be lying if I didn't just get this because they talk about cockles in Game of Thrones and I had never eaten them.  They are very similar to clams, but have a slightly different flavor.  This came with a light cream sauce and sea beans which are very salty and I was instructed to mix them in.  It was delicious if you like salty things, which I do.  Zach got the fish stew and wow, spicy!  Good, but spicy.  We finished off the meal with the apple tart and ice cream.  The crust was so buttery and outstanding.   I definitely want to come back for another dinner to try one of the towers and for brunch which sounds delicious.  Fabulous fish addition to Pittsburgh!",

The English muffin was dry. Crab cakes were decent, but the poached eggs were so under cooked the whites were running everywhere. My fiance got the steak and eggs, it was a bad cut of meat for a place that displays all of their steaks behind glass. Also it wasn't rested so it bled all over his plate.

They arrived, plates hot from the warmer, food cold, except top layer. Top it off, the selections - crab cake Benedict and baked herbed eggs- just not very good.

    "text": "We picked this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and we're glad we did. :) The environment was cozy and the staff was super friendly. We started with half dozen oysters; definitely some of the better ones we've had in town. For entrees, he order the clam bake and I got the scallops. The clam bake had some uniquely delicious flavors, but some of the clams were not as fresh, unfortunately. The dayboat scallops, on the other hand, were absolutely deciduous - definitely the highlight of the meal! While we waited for our desserts, the staff surprised us with a birthday cake! That's how we ended up eating three desserts for the night. :P Overall it was a great experience, and we'd definitely recommend!",

The bacon had an excellent smoke flavor and corn meal waffle was different, in a good way. The whole thing was delicious. She had the Herb Baked Egg. It too was delicious (for the first few minutes she was Mmm-ing with every bite). It tasted very good but would probably be too rich for me, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to finish that. Price was more than I'd normally pay for brunch but it was a nice splurge and well worth the price for something you're not going to find at most brunch places.",

You walk in from the outside ground floor of the Distrikt Hotel on the Boulevard and as soon as you walk in your immediately aware that this place is upscale and chic but cozy. The restaurant is downstairs and the bar is upstairs in the back. We made reservations but it was a slower evening. I'd definitely wear at least a polo and jeans. The food was SO good and their cocktail menu has something for everyone as well as a large book of fine wines. The menu is broken up into surf, turf, sides and apps. All sides are separate but only like 8 bucks or less. Get the mushrooms!!!  The mural is beautiful on the back wall. And all the seating is leather. Parking garage right down the street less than a block away! Go here and you won't be disappointed.   They change the menu for each season. For splitting an appetizer, getting a cocktail, a bread tray, a side and an entree I paid $62.00 before tipping.",

It's a smaller restaurant so for the amount of patrons being served I'm not sure why the service was slow.   We started with the bread board appetizer. It's a pretty simple appetizer and took about 30 mins to get served. We ordered two filets medium rare and the rib eye medium rare. My daughters steak was a perfect medium rare and mine was almost well done. You can't charge someone $53 for a steak and over cook it. I don't mind paying for GOOD food. I have a hard time paying a lot of money for food that is not good. Sorry I won't come back or recommend or The Whale.",

    "text": "May I just say that our man Andy was a superb waiter who worked to serve us 20 minutes after the restaurant closed. And our food was simply sublime.  We arrived at about 930 (restaurant closes at 1000), but they let us in anyway. It's not a giant restaurant, but it has ample seating and warm lighting that makes it feel intimate. The kitchen is open so you can see everything.   My daughter and I decided to get a variety of small plates and share. We got the smashed potatoes, garlic puree and baguette, lobster bisque, and the crab cakes. Well let me tell you, everything was just top notch. The garlic puree was solid. Nothing too crazy, but something really nice to balance out the decadence of the rest of our meal. The garlic itself was done well, without any hint of bitterness. The smashed potatoes were seasoned just perfectly. If you've had roasted potatoes before and are always having to salt them, you know what I mean. The potatoes in this dish had a beautiful crispy skin, and were salted exactly right. Every single potato was done perfectly. Every. One. It was like they came from potato heaven. And the crab cakes. Wow. The serving is 4 good sized crab cakes, with what seemed to be absolutely no filler and a beautiful crisp outside. This dish was also flavored very well and paired nicely with the potatoes. The crab cakes were topped with some dainty fresh greens and a red pepper remoulade.   But the piece de resistance was far and away the lobster bisque. The dish comes with the lobster cous cous and the tempura lobster tail already in the bowl. Then Andy comes over and pours the amazing lobster bisque all over the cous cous and the tempura. And then you have MAGIC. Now I have made cous cous before but my cous cous has never tasted like that. Like ever. Every single bit of that cous cous was filled with beautiful flavor and was perfectly done - no sticky mess here. The tempura was crispy on the outside and sweet and juicy on the inside - absolutely no amount of toughness at all. And the bisque. Oh mama the bisque. Just a beautiful beautiful pairing of textures and flavors. This presentation really made use of all those lovely lobster bits allowing each bit to just shine, while simultaneously preventing that sort of sameness that can overwhelm a dish even when the flavor profile is good. Really, there are not enough words to describe this bisque.   This lovely restaurant is located right at the entrance of the Distrikt Hotel Pittsburgh on Boulevard is the Allies. If you don't want to park in the hotel there is a public parking facility about two buildings down that is relatively reasonable at dinner. This restaurant is beautiful to eat in, has lovely committed staff, and serves food that is simply inspired. You must go.",

Amazing drinks (especially the garden party!) and all the food we had was incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Our friend had been a bunch of times so was able to give us the skinny on which dishes to get.  Some standouts were the charred octopus, trio of duck and the grilled Caesar salad (which was big enough to share with 3 people) although my most favorite thing we ate was the crab Mac n cheese.  It was so full of huge chunks of crab I just couldn't believe it.    Hubby, of course had to get the braised lamb neck which was done perfectly.  Our friend got the red snapper and wow - the skin was nice and crispy but the fish itself was tender and flavorful.  My scallops were huge and tasty - the bacon jam paired with it was perfect.   I really enjoyed the food - it was a bit pricey especially because a lot of it is a la cart but worth it for a nice night out.",

Definitely wouldn't fly in CA.   Garden Party (5/5): refreshing and yummy cocktail.   Roasted Salad (3/5): just okay, the dressing was mayo-ish which was weird.   Cod Chowder (4/5): unique and good, but could have a thinner consistency.   Crab Mac and Cheese (3/5): nothing special about it, would recommend ordering something else.

Definitely recommended. * Side of mushrooms. Solid, nothing special. * Shrimp scampi. Fresh, quality shrimp. But didnt really stand out. It was ok. * Salmon. Tasty, fresh, and high quality fish. The accompanyments were well-chosen. I would order it again. * Charred ceasar salad. Someone else in my party ordered it and didnt like it but I dont think they understood what they were getting. I'm not a Ceasar salad person * cod chowder. I cant really comment because I didnt sample it as it had bacon in it. * bread pudding dessert. Very tasty, definitely something I'd recommend and order again. It is a large piece.  So, considering all that, I'd say it is four stars. The service was solid though I think our server paid a little less attention once she saw we weren't ordering any alcohol.",

    "text": "I loved my trip to Or, The Whale with a friend for my birthday. We stopped in early before our reservation for a drink and hopped up to the decorative bar in the back of the restaurant. The bar was really cool because of its location above the majority of the restaurant on the level below. The rope decor that cascaded over the bar and draped down from the ceiling into the dining area tied together the nautical theme of the restaurant without being overdone.   I ordered the Garden Party and enjoyed the citrusy flavor of the drink. Not too boozy at all, but definitely had a kick. I appreciated the herbal notes of chamomile, lavender, and elderflower.   When we sat down for our reservation (which at first didn't seem necessary, but definitely was needed as the night went on--so call ahead people!), we were quickly greeted by our waiter, who was knowledgable but not overly friendly. My friend and I decided to strategically attack the menu--trying as many dishes as possible.   We ended up ordering a cheese plate, the bread board, and the clams casino to start. The cheese plate was one of the best that I've had. All of the cheeses were delicious and the pairings were varied yet complimentary to multiple of the different cheeses. I appreciated how the multitude of flavors easily mixed and matched with each other. The bread board was good (which was especially important because we had to pay for it); I preferred the sourdough over the black pepper biscuits. The clams casino were yummy, but definitely didn't blow me away. I was hoping for something more exciting because the dish is a classic that's becoming a bit tired. I wanted to see it reinvented.   For our second round we ordered the mussels, the crab mac and cheese, and some OTW fries. The mussels were phenomenal, and I appreciated the fact that they came with some grilled french bread to sop up the sauce (I can never have enough bread with mussels, though). The crab mac and cheese was unbelievably rich, but so goooooood. It was a large portion for a side order, so I definitely recommend splitting it. And unless you're a fan of incredibly rich food, I wouldn't order it as your meal unless you want cheese and cream overload. (Now that I say that, that really doesn't sound like a terrible thing...) If you order the OTW fries you will not be disappointed. The portion is HUUUUUUGE and the fries are seasoned perfectly. Definitely a good pairing with the mussels.   To wrap up our meal we ordered two desserts to share, of course: the chevre cheesecake dessert and the chocolate peanut butter lava cake. Both were divine! I loved having them right next to each other because the tartness of the cheesecake cut right through the lava cake. I was alternating bites and was pleased every time!  Or, The Whale is a great spot! I loved the food and enjoyed the atmosphere and service. Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "Or, The Whale is one of those farm to table places I hear about and want to try but then never think of when I'm wondering where I should go since I'm not often downtown for lunch or dinner.  But one day when looking for a nice breakfast/brunch spot in town to take my friend on a Saturday morning, this seemed like a good choice.  One thing I like about Or, The Whale is the earlier hours on Saturday.  Most places don't open for brunch until 10am but here they open at 9am (I'm more of a morning person).  The interior is an open space with seating around the upstairs area where you first walk in from Boulevard of the Allies.  Downstairs near the open kitchen and wood-fired grill is more seating.  Or, The Whale is located just next to the Distrikt Hotel in the old Salvation Army building (specifically in the renovated gymnasium).  There's a feeling of both comfort and luxury.  And that includes the service and food.  My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and a side of grilled bread which she enjoyed very much.  But not nearly as much as the breakfast poutine that tasted even better than I had hoped.  And just because, I decided to also order the chai cinnamon roll for breakfast dessert.  The combination of savory and sweet made this a marvelous brunch that I won't forget.    I may return to Or, The Whale for lunch and/or dinner.  But that brunch experience is definitely worth going back for.",

I was again disappointed with the wine offering, which is purposely limited to obscure bottles with prices that are probably too high, but you have no way to be sure. It's a limited menu place, like the many others in this category (think Union Standard, Acorn, Siempre Algo). These are high quality restaurants, but also indistinguishable. They don't inspire return visits, particularly because of the limited menus. I wish all of them well, but we surely don't need all of them.",

    "text": "Last night I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here for a girlfriend's birthday. We always try to do it big for this one night a year, and OTW was the perfect spot this year.   We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who offered a free coat check! Is it just me, or is there truly nothing better in the dead of winter?!  We had reservations for 5:30 and went early to have a drink at the bar. I loved the ambiance of their bar (the whole restaurant actually!) and they were super accommodating. We enjoyed the Garden Party cocktail and the tequila drink with a red wine float that I can't remember the name of but would absolutely recommend! Shortly after, we went back to the hostess stand and they took us to our table. It got really busy, so a reservation seemed like the way to go.   We ended up sharing several apps and sides throughout the evening. We started with the cheese and bread plates and they were phenomenal. Each cheese was served with a different sauce or jam and paired beautifully with the crisps it was served on. We then moved to the mussels and clams casino which were both fabulous. I loved the mussel sauce. Finally, we finished with OTW fries and the crab Mac n cheese. The fries were a huge portion but I can't say enough about how yummy they were. The crab Mac left me wanting more, but my friend loved it. Throughout the night, we drank wine based on the manager's recommendations and they were wonderful.   Of course, we had to end the night with TWO desserts: cheesecake and the chocolate peanut butter lava cake. WOW. they stole the show!   Overall, the atmosphere is really cool and I loved the open kitchen. Our service was good but not exceptional,  but I can't wait to go back!",

The attention to detail here is amazing, you'll have to ask of the background of the restaurant to know what I mean  We started with the Dry Aged Beef Tartare, which in all my Tartare tastings has been the best to date, definitely a great starter, and yes two pieces of bread is enough! My main course was the Lamb Neck, now I'm no fan usually of lamb but I'm glad I had went with this, it was perfection with the meat falling off the bone and so tender. Certainly will be coming back!",

(I am a Hilton Diamond Elite member) service was horrible the first day, got the eggs Benny, which was ok but drowning in Hollandaise Sauce. My gf hated the server and was annoyed they had no artificial sweeteners. The place felt pretentious but it was a complimentary breakfast.  The next morning, we waited 5-7 minutes to be acknowledged, THE PLACE WAS EMPTY, we were told there was a lot of reservations, but we can sit at the bar. We were ignored at the bar for about 10 minutes, we then asked what we can order with our vouchers, the waitress didn't know and didn't offer us anything to drink. She then asked her manager about the menu and he seemed to ignore her.... 10 minutes later I have a angry girlfriend who walked out and then I walked out and no one acknowledged that we left, even though we walked by the manager and waitress.",

    "text": "Phenomenal multi level farm to table restaurant located inside The Distriket hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. My fiance and I came here the other night for a date night and were very pleased. We couldn't believe it took us so long to give this place a try. We had a reservation but arrived early so went straight to the bar. Bar wraps all the way around so there is a good bit of space. The main entrance leads you to the upstairs and that's where the bar is located. You can look down to the bottom level of the restaurant which is beautifully decorated with lots of bright lighting. The bartenders served us immediately. They know their stuff and whipped up amazing cocktails. I had the garden party which was a refreshing mix of vodka and Prosecco. Cocktails and wine range in price form $10-$15 which is a tad expensive but the cocktails are great quality. I would totally come back and just sit at the bar next time for cocktails and apps.   Service was amazing. We had a fabulous server who made sure we were well taken care of. She was also very knowledge about the menu as well as beer, wine, and cocktail pairings with the food. She was constantly refilling our water. I wish I could remember her name anyway she gets 5 stars!   We started out with the steak tartare and cheese board. Steak tartare was full of flavor and served with grilled bread. For the cheese board you can choose 3 or 5 cheeses. We chose 3 and it was the perfect amount. The cheeses change all the time so you may get something different next time. Each cheese had a honey/glaze to dip and each one paired so well. My fiance had the pork chop which he raved about. The meat was cooked perfectly. I had the salmon succotash and was so happy with my choice. It had such a hearty flavor and the portion was just right not too big or small. I would absolutely get it again, such a unique dish. We also got the French Fries as they were recommended by the bartender...wow! Perfectly crisp and fresh and served with homemade ketchup. Best fries I ever had. For dessert we opted for the peanut butter lava cake which is perfection! It's to die for and you must try it, chocolate and peanut better what's not to love. I will be back to try the crab Mac it looked so good but I had no more room.   I absolutely recommend Or, the whale if you're staying at the hotel or just for a night out.",

The space was lovely with lots of nice, ambient touches. I'm a book nerd, so I particularly enjoyed all of the literary + nautical touches. But all of that is just window dressing and doesn't matter at all if the food doesn't deliver. Luckily ... it did.   We had the savory waffles -- with hollandaise and maple syrup, bacon, sausage, egg, and potatoes. It was a mountain of breakfast deliciousness, the perfect balance of savory and sweet. My kiddo -- who is three and enjoyed getting to spy on the cooking, looking into the open kitchen from the top level -- got the oatmeal, which was so tasty. Topped with caramelized bananas and fresh blackberries, it was amongst the most impressive oatmeal dishes I've ever seen.   The service was awesome -- our waitress Stephanie made some great recommendations of where we might take our toddler to play nearby -- and even stopped us on our way out the door with a last minute idea.   Thank you for the great experience!",

With this entree you got both bacon and sausage score!  The scrambled eggs were good, the potatoes solid plus the sausage was fantastic and had a nice spicy kick to it.  The grilled bread was tasty and they had a homemade jam you can ask for.  I did not leave hungry! The menu had a lot of good choices. A few in our party started with the monkey bread and it was a warm, sugary delight. It was all a bit pricy but what can you expect at a hotel restaurant.

    "text": "So wanted to love this place & excited to get Saturday night reservations for my LA friends, we did NOT have a good experience at all. It started with the cold greeting at the door.  When being led to our table we realized its a two-level open restaurant so being upstairs is like a balcony and you hear everything on the lower level. And not just murmurs, the noise is magnified. There was a large party with squeals and over the top laughter & yelling that was deafening upstairs. It was so bad that we almost left but when we spoke to a manager about moving tables, we were told they would be leaving very soon. So we ordered food and it was as slow coming to the table as the drinks when we first sat down. And regarding drinks, my friend ordered a glass of wine, and it was clearly from a bottle that had been opened for a long time, and her concern was then confirmed by the waitress. For more than an hour and a half, we suffered through the extreme noise, adding to it by yelling across the small table to have a conversation through the appetizers, a selection of cheeses, salads and main courses.  We could finally hear when finishing our dinner and through dessert, as the whole restaurant seemed to clear out at once at what seemed early too. So with the cold greeting and a painfully shy waitress who though nice, did not have good timing or responses to questions, the person in charge never came back to check on us even when the noise settled. We know that management can't kick out this party, but politely asking them to tone down the screaming would have been appropriate or tend to the other customers suffering. It seemed there was no concern about the effect on everyone else's experience. The couple next to us even commented on hoping the noise would settle soon for us as they were leaving.  In the end, I wanted to look for something good about the evening: the valet had my car waiting when we exited and opened all of our doors. Big check/Big disappointment.",

I just didn't get completely wowed with my meal and my friend with me left in an utter rage and would probably give one star if she used yelp. She got the eggs benny and her eggs were extremely runny and her salad had no dressing on it at all. She described it as dry leaves on her plate. My meal was okay but it was cold, purposely but I didn't know I was being served a non heated meal. It was hard boiled eggs, cold, mildly fatty ham, flavorless cheese, dried apricots, some pickled mix of stuff I didn't know what it was and a few small wedges of very chewy bread. I would not order the chefs breakfast again. I also would never order the eggs benny (what my friend ordered). The positives were that that restaurant is well themed and very nice to look at. Another negative was that the bartender took the sugar for my friends coffee away and gave it to the couple next to us without asking and never offered to return it even tho my friend got another coffee. The blood Mary was tasty but when the drink is as much as your breakfast I wouldn't order more than one! It was $10 - which I suppose is fine but the food should have been better.",

We were impressed when first walked in, immediately noticing the amazing mural on the back wall of the restaurant featuring Moby Dick (hence the name of the place). We checked our coats, gave them the name of our reservation, and the hostess sat us. Once seated we noticed that tables were quite long, causing people sitting across from each other to have to talk louder than normal, making the overall volume of the restaurant pretty loud, which was unexpected. We ordered some cocktails, both of which were good, but at $14 a piece, definitely weren't some of the best drinks that we have had in the city. We ordered two appetizers, the mussels and the octopus. The mussels were good, but we really wish we would have tried them before we ate the octopus, because it was by far the best octopus we have ever had. It was incredibly tender and covered in a delightfully salty chimichurri. The biggest downside was I was expecting more than one 4\" tentacle for the price. Again, the mussels were quite good, very large, and a good portion but taste wise couldn't hold up to the octopus. Then we waited for our entrees. And we waited. And we waited. Several times our waitress came up and apologized for the delay and that it shouldn't be much longer. Well, at the 1.5 hour mark we asked if she could find out how much longer it would be. Within a few min they brought them out. My wife ordered a short rib pasta and I ordered the scallops. Hers was a decent portion size, and had a great overall flavor although it was very salty. My scallops were great, but the portion size was minimal. It consisted of 3 fifty cent piece size scallops with maybe 6 home made potato chips. Once we got our check we let our waitress know that we in no way thought the delay was her fault, but if she could let her manager know that the wait was very disappointing. A moment later she came back to our table and said that the manger would be stopping by our table before she ran the check. Another 15 min passed before the manger was finally able to stop by. He was very nice and apologetic, and took a round of drinks off of bill. Neither him, nor our waitress, were able to tell us why our food took so long, just that they were sorry.  Overall most of the food was good, but beyond the octopus, I feel we could get better elsewhere and with it currently being one of the most expensive restaurants in Pittsburgh we just expected more. If I was just reviewing the food I probably would have given it 4 stars, good but not great. It definitely lost a star for the ridiculous amount of time it took to get our food.",

I've been in a  thorough search for the best eggs Benedict in town (I'm new in Pittsburgh) and I got the eggs Chesapeake here and they immediately became my new favorite all time brunch meal. My friends and I shared the dark chocolate mousse and the creme brulee and they were PERFECT. Apart from the amazing food and the beautiful navy decoration, the service was incredible! I asked for tea and Our lovely server, Cindy, brought us a full tray of the different teas they have. She also gave us a full description of every plate/drink we ordered. She was very attentive, helpful and sweet and made our brunch an even better experience. This is our new FAVORITE BRUNCH PLACE. And the great deal is that they have it 7 days a week!!  Thank you Or, the Whale for helping me complete my brunch research.",

So much sauce it made the farm fresh bacon sloppy and chewy the entire dish inedible. Also the shakshuka was bland and served with extremely crunchy burned triangles of pitas. The dish should have been served with actual soft pita bread on the side so you could use it to eat the food! The 6 meals my friends and I had were sub par and we were very disappointed in what we had. The best part of the meal was the MONKEY BREAD! That was the bomb!",

Hard boiled eggs, speck, mostarda, dried apricots, grilled bread, and cheddar. Everything was delicious and the portion was just right. Or, the whale is located in the brand new Distrikt hotel. They have valet service but we were able to find street parking a short walk from the restaurant. I'm excited to visit this new addition to downtown Pittsburgh again very soon.",

    "text": "So many good things!! The atmosphere is amazing! Kudos to the decorators for creating such an inviting place!! The biscuits and butter served first are delicious - a great start to the meal. The wedge salad was delightful, but I could have done without the extra large wooden bowl that it came in - was somewhat awkward to maneuver. My spouse ordered the $45 duck burger and said that, while it was good, it was not $45 good. He was bummed that he did not order a steak. My scallops were AMAZING!! Perfectly cooked and the corn puree underneath was the perfect complement. We were too stuffed to try dessert.    The bad thing for us, was our table. We were seated upstairs in the far corner. Within minutes of us getting settled another table was seated right next to us. As is the unfortunate trend in many fine dining establishments, this table was WAY too close for comfort. To make it worse, the other side of our table was smack up against the server POS station. We spent our evening trying not to hear everything the couple next to us said and trying to avoid the \"rear view\" of the servers as they put their orders in. Not what you would call \"romantic\" at all.    The other \"bad\" for me was when the couple next to us left and the hostess came to clean the table. She cleared the plates, lifted the placemats, wiped the table and then put the DIRTY placemats back on the table - never wiped them off. As you can imagine, we found this a bit off-putting.   Being that oTW just opened on Wednesday, I know there are some kinks that still need to be worked out, and I will not let that stop me from returning!! The food was delicious and the atmosphere very welcoming. We are anxious to try a steak on our next visit!",

Now for the not so good, the kitchen was ridiculously slow.  We went on a Sunday night before 8 with 10 people in the whole place and it took 20 minutes between course. It was an hour before our entree came out.  They apologized with a desert but then that took another 10 minutes for that. Also the octopus appetizer is just confused. The addition of olives just overwhelms all the other flavors and ruins the dish.  Hopefully the kitchen gets its act together.  Also note it is $$$ - $$$$",

I went with a date to Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.  I was really wary of this.  I've never done Restaurant Week.  I was worried that maybe they'd have something \"off menu\" to showcase the restaurant then if I came back some other time I wouldn't be able to find it.  I confirmed that the selections were available and perused the menu just to see if something REALLY jumped out at me.    It didn't.  That sounds negative, but I don't mean it to; the restaurant week menu looked good.  I didn't see anything that said...\"Try me I am way more amazing\".    The waiter seemed knowledgeable, and was helpful and attentive.  The ambience was...pretty, but not particularly memorable once you get past the statement-mural of moby dick launching over the bow of the Pequod (I assume that's the Pequod...*insert 30 minute google search for diagrams of Nantucket whaling vessels*...it's probably the Pequod), the only truly decoratively arresting feature would be a series of thick parallel ropes festooning the length of the ceiling.  I did like that the restaurant was two levels, and the stairway was eye-catching.    I don't recall the drink menu.  Does that mean it's not memorable?  I suppose by definition it WOULD mean that, but my short term memory is a bit suspect more and more lately.  So maybe the drinks are good.  Anyway...good seafood.  I enjoyed the experience.  But it was nothing that a dozen other restaurants can't match.",

    "text": "Brunch Club found its way downtown and landed on the tail of, Or, The Whale, a restaurant located in the District Hotel on the Blvd. of the Allies.  There was a lot on the corner of Grant, adjacent to the hotel, that had $5 parking.  My one friend parked on the street for free.  Keep in mind, there was not a big sporting event this day so it was a bit easier (and cheaper) to find parking.  The physical space sits at the bottom of the steps when you walk through the front door.  There is a mezzanine so you can look down at the kitchen and everyone dining before you are shown to your table.  Once seated you're surrounded by a nice nautical design - huge thick ropes streaming above to replicate the sail of a boat with great lighting hanging from the ceiling.  The back wall is painted with a scene from Moby Dick, with the whale being the centerpiece.  Staff members are dressed in blue and white striped shirts.    The menu comes in a booklet with a nice leather cover.  Each page is a different chapter in the book, appetizers, of course, being chapter one.  You get the picture.    I ordered an Iced Tea and the Eggs Benny, which, mind you, were served on a homemade English Muffin.  The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it.  Sitting across from me, my friend had the Croquet Madam which was even larger with a side of the extremely sugary monkey bread.  One tiny bite of the bread was enough for me - it was almost enough to fuel my trip back to my house.  Each of my friend's portions were quite large and everyone agreed that the portions were more than enough for brunch.  Our server was quick and attentive.   My only nit-picky criticism is that my iced tea, which was never even refilled, cost $5.  My one friend, who had a Bloody Mary, a cup of coffee, the monkey bread and an entree paid $42 for his meal.  My total bill was $21.40, and I think that is just a little high, but the cost of the iced tea was exorbitant.",

The waiter my girlfriend and I had was a bit chatty but he meant well. We were given bread to eat before our meal to keep us occupied while we waited for food. I ordered the roasted half chicken which came with a ravioli. I only ordered this dish because it was one of the cheaper dishes. This isn't a place I would frequent due to the prices set in the menu. It was a very delicious piece of half chicken with charred vegetables. It was flavorful but took quite a long time to get the dish out. I understand getting a fresh dish to the customer but I feel like they could improve getting the half chicken to the table a bit faster. The guy at the table beside me seemed to be waiting quite a while as well. I probably won't be back for dinner unless I want to celebrate winning the lottery. I might come back to try out the brunch if I'm somehow convinced.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch with some friends yesterday morning. This space inside of the Distrik Hotel (sp?) is small, but it is two floors. If you made a reservation for a group, your whole party has to be there before you be seated (FYI). Once we were seated, our drink orders were taken. They had the standard brunch drinks (mimosas, bellinis, bloody Mary's, beer, etc). The food menu was short, but they had a variety of different options for every taste bud. I decided on the smoked salmon dish. From reading the description, I didn't really know what to expect,  but I tried it anyways. I wish I would have gotten a picture of it because it was very interesting (and tasty!!). There was a bed of greens on the left, and surrounding the greens was smoked salmon and cucumbers rolled up to look like roses. In the middle of the plate was three slices of grilled bread (so hearty and so good) and there was also a soft boiled egg and some kind of sauce with capers in it. I ate the whole thing, it was so good! My other friends got the eggs benedict with the crab cakes, and the American breakfast. Everyone was so good! The service was superb. They even had an employee dressed like a captain walking around, I thought it was a cute touch.   The only issue I had, was that we had a reservation for 10:30 a.m. and they were already out of yogurt for the granola dish. I read other Yelp reviews and they said or, The Whale was out of ingredients for the day on other days too.   Other than that, I can't wait to come back for dinner one day!",

We sat near the bar, but overlooking the bottom of the restaurant. Perfect view to see everything that's going on (and the kitchen!).  The menu isn't super long, but all the options looked amazing. We got the monkey bread as an appetizer. Amazing. Perfectly sweet, and a good portion to split between two people. Also, only $6! I got the American Breakfast ($14, 2 eggs scrambled, fingerling potatoes, sausage, bacon, and grilled bread), and my friend got the Eggs Chesapeake ($18, eggs benedict with a crab cake and green salad on the side). Both of us thoroughly enjoyed out meals. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and I can honestly say, this is the best breakfast I've had at a restaurant in Pittsburgh. Everything tastes fresh, and I didn't leave feeling heavy or hungry. The scrambled eggs were creamy yet cooked through. The sausage was so great and made in house; I'm usually not the biggest fan of sausage but I ate almost all of it! The grilled bread is such a great touch to the meal. And the potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was truly a great meal.  The staff honestly made it better. Everyone was attentive to my friend and I, checking on us, making sure we had everything we needed. This was such a great experience - I can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner!",

The service from our waiter Tom was excellent and very accommodating. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hostess was lazy and non accommodating. We asked if we could have the wi-fi passcode and she said they don't have wi-fi...... really????!!! A hotel in the 21st century without wi-fi??!!! I doubt it. Luckily Tom was more than happy to give it to us. This hostess needs to learn the main part of her job is being a good host- thus, word hostess! Other than that , highly recommend   I did come back for dinner and it certainly didn't disappoint! I had the cod chowder, which was so delicious that I dream about it! Delicious piece of cod with a wonderful chowder poured over the fish and potatoes table side,  just wonderful. I also had the mussels appetizer that was sheer perfection. I also will be changing my 4 stars to 5 because the hostess Markia ( not sure if correct spelling) was beyond accommodating!  Fantastic restaurant!!!!",

We used valet parking ($8) and had our coats checked by the hostess. We were seated downstairs at a table for 2 in the middle of the restaurant. Tables are spaced out well enough that you aren't on top of the other patrons and the noise level isn't out of control.   Our waiter and all other staff were attentive and knowledgeable. We started with the shrimp and crab cocktail and the focaccia bread that was brought to the table. Both were delicious and we could have eaten lots more of both. I had the cod chowder which was really decadent and delicious, great savory flavor. My friend had the Caesar salad which also looked good and fresh.  Our chosen entrees were the pork chop and the bavette steak. The pork chop was met with rave reviews, the steak had great flavor and was cooked as asked but was extremely chewy. For dessert we tried the cheesecake, the bee sting cake and the salted peanut tart. All were excellent but the stand out was the bee sting cake. Baked in a crock and drizzled with some type of sauce this would be something I would every time I ate there.",

I wanna tell you the best people working in this place are the greeter, the man who presented our cheese, and the bar back. All friendly, the greeter helped us decide on seating and was very accommodating. We sat and none of the bar staff -- there were at least two, and it wasn't all that busy even made eye contact with us. We sat there for quite some time -- right in the front, and finally asked for a drink and food menu. Once we got the drinks - I wanna say mine was delicious, but my friend said his was only decent. This may have been overlooked if we would have had good service, but that wasn't happening. The man who brought us our cheeses did a great job of explaining them and they were pretty tasty except I thought maybe some of the toast had some sort of buttery spread on it, so it was at some points overwhelming and taking over the flavor of the cheese. The bar back who was kind of like our bff, because he was washing out the glasses on the ledge right in front of us was very nice. I had asked him to get us a few things but then my friend pointed out that he was the bar back so it probably wasn't his job. This man then came out, kind of with a derby hat on and asked us how everything was. So that was nice but we had to head off to the theatre so we just grabbed our check and ran. I really loved the atmosphere and maybe the staff was just having a bad day. Everyone who we talked to later said it is better place for brunch than drinks, so maybe we'll try that next time.",

My party arrived on time for our reservation only to be told they could not seat us because they had no menus? 7-10 minutes later the hostess & manager arrived back to the hostess stand with menus so we could finally be seated.......How weird.   Drink & appetizer orders were placed which came out as expected.   After perusing the menu each member of my party (5 people in total) placed their entree orders which all happened to be different menu items.   4 out of 5 meals were bland, over cooked, luke warm and not nearly worth the $30/plate we paid.   I had ordered the flounder with garlic risotto. There was absolutely no flavor- so little flavor I had to ask for salt. I barely took three bites.   I hoped to explain my dissatisfaction with my meal to my waitress however she was hardly present. The dishes were cleared by a bus boy before I had the chance.   For a restaurant that almost exclusively serves seafood & steaks, the quality of these items were straight up bad. I was terribly disappointed not only in the food itself but also the service I received. $250 later and I would not at all recommend this restaurant. 1.5 stars if possible.",

Today, had generously portioned lunch with friends. The burger was juicy and flavorful. The salad had a nice, light dressing. We all loved the bread and butter pickles. Dinner and drink prices are very high for Pittsburgh, but lunch prices are very reasonable - averaging around $15 for large portions with great flavor. This may become my go-to place for a lunch meeting, since it was quieter and easy to hear the conversation throughout the meal.",

It was literally like chewing rubber and tasted like it was under the warmer for 2 days or certainly reheated at least once, if not twice. It also looked disgustingly rotten in some spots.

From the outside, the building looks like a typical hotel that has it's own bar, but inside the bar is much more modern than expected. There are 2 bars, one upstairs and another downstairs. We were at the upstairs bar, where they had comfortable couches and chairs to relax and talk with people. Small tables in front of the couches had games like chess and Jenga, which was great for entertainment. The service was very attentive and circulated the area filling our water glasses and asking if we needed another drink throughout the night. The happy hour specials are also cheap, I was able to get a beer for $3. We were all very relaxed and comfortable in this bar, almost like we were hanging out in someone's house rather than a public place.",

I cannot speak for that, and the pictures do look good, and the price seems reasonable. Maybe worth checking that out. But I had dinner and was not impressed.  Also, I agree with everyone that the space is beautiful. I think there's a lot of potential for this if they can work on a few things.  What I would encourage them to focus on:  One: wait staff training. Our waitress clearly did not know the menu well enough. For a seafood restaurant, when I asked her what the Oyster selection was, she said \"they're from Virginia\".  Could not say anything else about them when I asked. Had the same problem describing some of the other menu items.  Two: plating. I thought the big wooden salad bowls were a terrible idea. It looks silly on the table and given what's inside them it's overkill. I also had some kind of seafood stew in a giant metal pot that was difficult to eat out of and again, completely unnecessary.  Three: menu items. Again, I think at this price point some of the food was less than outstanding and lacked flavor. Everyone at my table had the same response. Again, this is something that can get refined if they're willing to work on the menu some more. But there are too many good seafood options and steak options in town for them to be anything less than stellar at that price point.  I'm rooting for them to sort these issues out and make this one of the great restaurant to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere - very well designed space with a lofted second story. The aesthetic is beautiful. It evokes a nautical adventure but manages to not fall totally into kitsch. The attention to style was evident in all of the details - even when the pieces didn't quite work, such as the medicine dropper hot sauce dispenser.  Unfortunately they didn't seem to pay as much attention to the brunch menu as they did the interior design. The food was generally over cooked - dried out biscuits and practically hard boiled \"baked\" eggs and underwhelming.  And while an entire item was left off the plate of one member of my party (it was eventually brought out after we asked about it), service was friendly and attentive.  In the end, the atmosphere is a selling point, but not enough to overcome the disappointing quality of the food.",

We had a quick dinner at the bar which included mussels, shrimp cocktail, and scallops and each dish was the best I've had in town, with meaningful portions!!  We then celebrated a birthday party with friends, and Nico, the bartender and staff treated us great! Would highly recommend checking this place out!",

I can't say I've been to a restaurant where i have to pay for the bread. The food was okay, but definitely not worth the high price. The other couple we were with both ordered steaks. One was barely cooked  dessert and drinks were good, but meals were not worth it",

Katherine, our waitress, was so on her game and so knowledgeable with drinks and food pairings. No complaints at all. A must go!   Also, the \"Catcher in the Rye\" drink was perfectly balanced. Such a fun night with the hubby. Now it's time for dancing!",

    "text": "Went on a Sat eve at 6. Greeted nicely and sat immediately with our reservation that I made that day for 2.  Atmosphere is awesome and noise level is pleasant where we sat.  Service was very good. We had Mixed drinks that were basic and not on the menu.  We ordered the mussel appetizer and it was well worth it. We enjoyed the staring biscuits too.  We had the pork chop and the trout for our main course, cauliflower and the crab Mac and cheese. All were awesome but I do think there could be a bite or two more of crab in there. We concluded with a shared chocolatey coffee dessert.  All on point and served beautifully.  Services was well attentioned and not annoying. I would recommend everything we ate.  We spent $150 on 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, two main dishes, 2 sides and 1 dessert.  Go and enjoy!",
