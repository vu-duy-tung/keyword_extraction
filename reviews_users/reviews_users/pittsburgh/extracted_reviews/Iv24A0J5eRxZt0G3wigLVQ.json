I met a small group there Friday after work to have some drinks and eat dinner.  If you are a beer lover this is certainly the place for you as it is quite difficult to find a place with more Belgian beers on tap than here.  Also their bottle selection is top notch.  They are pretty pricey but it is some of the best beer in the world (this location being in Sewickley may have something to do with it too).    The food was also very good.  They have a pretty diverse menu with typical bar type finger foods to basic burgers.  But they also have some pretty interesting apps and gourmet burgers (Kobe beef, Lamb/Sirloin, Ostrich) plus quality entrees.  I will certainly be coming back to this place often, and will likely try out the other locations when in their neighborhoods.",

They have a rotating selection of beer on tap and a lot of seasonals. One caveat is that they refuse to put a cider on tap, even a local one like Arsenal. I have been told that the manager will not allow it because they are a beer establishment. Too bad because cider is coming into its own.",

Granted, it was a slow night, but our experience was wonderful.  We were seated immediately. And our waitress, Emily, came over with beer lists immediately. We all had burgers - 2 sharp burgers & 1 HTB. All of the burgers were perfectly cooked. I tried the Flemish onion soup & LOVED it - it's lighter & sweeter than your typical onion soup. One person in my party had the New England clam chowder that was on special & liked it. The only complaint I can come up with is that the fries were a tad undercooked - but the garlic aioli made up for it.  I am honestly shocked at the comments others have left about service. Emily was awesome & continued to check in on us & bring us fresh beers.",

The service wasn't the fastest but the food was okay.   Our biggest gripe was the misrepresentation of the entree prices in the menu.  On it, entrees are to include 2 sides.  At the bottom of the menu are only a selection of 5 or 6 sides.  We ordered our sides and when we got our bill, the entree prices were marked up a few dollars for the sides we ordered.  We asked the server about it and he pointed to a section of the menu under burgers where it listed up-charges for certain items.  OKAY, but that wasn't what the page of entrees said.  $18 for salmon and then have to pay a dollar more for a side salad and $2 more for the veggies of the day?!  The manager came out and rather than simply apologizing for the misrepresentation in the menu, she went to blame the server for not informing us on the extra charges and complained that the menu hadn't been updated and caused her frustration.    I definitely think the situation could have been handled in a more professional manner.  I highly doubt I will go back.  Food and drinks were mediocre and overpriced.",

I haven't noticed that this location had prices that were higher than the others like some other reviewers have suggested. It's a little high compared to your typical wings and pizza joint, but I'd consider Sharp Edge a few steps above your typical wing and pizza place, so I'd expect the prices to reflect that.   My favorite menu items are the boneless wings, frites, and at the East Liberty location, they have fried tofu which is to die for. I wish all of the locations included the tofu on their menus. I've had friends who have tried the sandwiches and enjoyed them as well.  I'm not a beer drinker, but they also have a large selection as far as beverages go.  I'd definitely recommend Sharp Edge to friends.",

Kind of a weird vibe - lots of bright lighting filled with masses of local post-college crowd that still live in mom & dad's basement. Most of the draft beer selection consists of very high alcohol content beer which is fine... but hard to drink a ton of. Anything else you might want is served in bottles. Everything is pricey. $8+  Never really had the food - but the late night buffalo bites (half off after 10pm) are quite good... worth it when half off   Don't forget to try the $4 \"mystery draft\" ... whatever the hell this actually is.

We were SO glad this place did NOT disappoint! They were accommodating & welcoming from the first step we made in and when we made a change from dining room seating to bar seating. The server was most gracious and escorted us to the bar.  Bartender was not in any way aloof but was friendly, patient & informative in helping us with beer selection from their vast offering of craft, imports and domestics. She understood what it means to take care of the customer when she assured us that the specific requests to the order we made and how it should be up to temperature on serving should be executed. So much so that when my Cracked Pepper & Garlic mussels were served they were delivered by both she & the Chef to be positive of their quick expediting.  The mussels were cooked perfectly, delivered hot, and the garlic - though prolific - was sweet and enhanced the mussels flavor but did not overpower them. Burger ordered was cooked nicely and had all the promised trimmings appetizingly presented. Homemade bleu cheese dressing was outstanding on the field green said which was completely absent of the dreaded \"wilties\" - it was chilled, fresh and flavorful.  We enjoyed more of the Sharp Edge cuisine and atmosphere while learning more \"beer lore\" from their head Cellarman Brett. He was both informative and knowledgeable whilst guiding us in our selections both Belgian & Craft beers. We were even given a personal invitation to attend their Oktoberfest in the coming weeks.  Meanwhile, we also had the pleasure of conversing with the General Manager Gino, who was very happy to list for us other Pittsburgh eateries he felt upheld the standard of good food & service Sharp Edge in Sewickley provides. His wine and overall food knowledge was also extensive.  Clearly the Sharp Edge has the edge when it comes to attentive, spot on service and treatment of even it's later dinner service customers during the week night's. We will return to this cozy quaint Bistro soon and had the polar opposite experience in comparison with our last review in Cranberry at Houlihan' s. We commend Sharp Edge' s team in the Sewickly Bistro striving for the leading edge in both food and service!  Job well done one and all!",

Sharp Edge is the only place in the city (to my knowledge) where you can find Gulden Draak on tap (and obviously Gulden Draak = instant happiness).  The managers, bartenders, and waitstaff at Sharp Edge Sewickley are wonderful.  They know their beer, and if you visit more than a few times, they'll know your name.  The food:  Well, the food pairs well with beer, but don't go to a Sharp Edge expecting a gourmet meal... you aren't going to get it.  That is to be expected at a restaurant where the beer menu is 6+ pages longer than the food menu.    Visit between 4:30-6:30 on Monday through Friday for Happy Hour:  1/2 off ALL Belgian drafts and $1 off all other drafts.  If you're anything like me, you'll only need 1 or 2 drinks (at 7-11.5% alcohol) before you have to cut yourself off.  If you keep that in mind, it's a reasonable happy hour paycheck.  Bud Light is the only domestic beer offered, and they'll charge you upwards of $6 for a bottle (but if you are the kind of person that SHOULD frequent SE, this is a nonissue).",

We made reservations, and upon arrival, the hostess looked at her book, which was completely blank, and said, \"oh somebody must have forgotten to write it down hahaha\". After about 20 minutes, we were seated. Our first server came by after a very very long wait and took our drink order. After several minutes, she came back to tell us they were out of the beer I ordered. I ordered something else, this time another woman came out to say they were out of that and half the beers on the list. She then told us that the first round of drinks would be on them. This was a nice gesture, but we didn't come for free drinks.   We got the boneless buffalo bites as an app. Pretty tasty. Two of us got onion soup, and two of us got a beef stew. When the soups came out, she warned us they were exremely hot. My stew was barely warm. Felt like it had been pulled out of a fridge and microwaved for 20 seconds on low heat. The onion soups were very very hot, but the flavor was pretty meh.  As a main course, I went with the small plate crab cakes. They were well-seared, but they were very mushy inside. Probably a pretty low quality meat mixed with a bunch of filler. The sauce on top was the only saving grace. My wife got the chicken salad, and took about two bites. It was served with some pretty sad looking pink mushy out of season tomatoes.   My friend got the beef stew pot pie thing, and they didn't even bring a spoon. It was basically a soup with a crust on top.  Finally, I need to talk about the ridiculous prices here. $4.75 for a Yuengling? Come on. You can imagine how much the imports cost. Thank god our beers were free.",

    "text": "Great beer selection, uneven service (the wait staff tends not to be seasoned fine dining pros, so take that for what you will), and food that is above-average bar fare but will NOT satisfy the specific tastes of foodies.  I'm only going to penalize one star for the service and food, because honestly -- this place is about the beer.  And again, a warning to foodies -- you will not like the food or the service -- I have yet to know foodies who are repeat customers unless they are belgian beer aficionados or unless they reside within walking distance of the establishment.  One final plus: food is served until bar closing, which tends to be around midnightish.  This place has great hours, especially if you tend to work until late at night and need to grab a meal before heading to bed.  These sorts of hours are hard to find in this neck of the woods.  At Christmas time, they offer a neat variety of belgian beer baskets which make great gifts for those hard-to-buy-for family members.  Also, Yelp: you have two separate listings for this restaurant.  Please fix.",

For the stuffed cabbage special (last week) came with only 2, & they were very small as stuffed cabbage goes, topped with a few tablespoons (maybe ) of some burn tasting red sauce. And to top it off the cabbage was bright green like it wasn t even cooked. And surprise, they were filled with white rice! Oh yeah, the brown half-a-pea-sized pieces were ground meat that wouldn t even equal a tablespoon. If I wasn t dining with my friends friends (people that I just met) I would have sent this back. The Waitress should have been just as embarrassed as the Chef for putting it on the plate. It cost $15. I can t remember what I had the first 2 times I was there, just that it wasn t memorable.

    "text": "I've been coming to Sharpe Edge in both Sewickley and downtown, but this was the last time. We should've turned around as soon as we walked in. The entire bar and restaurant was empty at 1:30 on the Sunday of Labor Day. We waited in the front to be seated for over 10 minutes. A waitress finally appeared from the back and sat us.  I was out with my fiance, my child and my little brother and his girlfriend. One look at us and it was easy to see it was a family situation with us being of age. When it was time to order drinks I was asked for my ID, which is fine. But then every thing went down hill. The waitress exclaimed \"are you sure this is you? It doesn't look like you.\" Uhhh excuse me? I told her it was me and even pulled out two other forms of ID but she wasn't convinced. \"I'm just thrown off by your hair color\" uh ok? People do dye their hair. She said that they had been having issues with fake IDs at their other location and needed to make sure. Very unprofessional to tell customers about your servers lacking the skill to be able to decipher IDs, don't you think?  After our waitress left I thought it was over, until a manager came to our table to \"investigate an ID\" what?? Are you kidding me??? I was beyond annoyed and offended at this point. No one in the establishment seemed to be able to wrap their heads around the concept of changing ones hair color.  After she hassled me about my ID, I was finally \"granted\" permission to drink. The manager came up again and said \"I want us to be on the same page, and I hope you're not offended. We've been having issues with IDs downtown and got in trouble by the liquor control board.\" Once again I told her that I certainly was offended and that this was ridiculous. And once again, how unprofessional is it to tell customers about your other restaurant getting in trouble by the LCB????? After that it was a painfully long time until we received our beers. Then another painful long stretch of time before our orders were taken, and then another to get our food. Keep in mind the restaurant was basically empty!  At the end of the meal our waitress came over and randomly started telling us long stories about all the issues with her kids in her life. Very strange, but definitely an attempt to salvage a tip at at the end of a disastrous meal.   In short: the service is bad, the food is overpriced, and management is incompetent when it comes to proper business practices.  I'm an adult and a mother with a career. I shouldn't be hassled at a restaurant to get a drink because I look young or because I changed my hair color. You have lost a customer of almost 10 years.",

    "text": "First and foremost, this place is now a Sharp Edge Bistro.  Not sure when that happened, but everything is exactly the same, just a newer name for an expanding local chain.  We were not in the mood for fast food the other evening and decided to just keep driving on Ohio River Blvd. until we found something different and not fast food.  There is a small outdoor seating area that can fit maybe six at most, when you walk in you find yourself at the bar and additional seating is available in the back of the place.  We asked for a table or booth in order to bypass the noise level of the bar.  The back area is rather dimly lit, and with the impending storms about to roll through that left the little natural lighting to come in be muted.  Service was rather quick, within minutes we had our drink orders in which gave us time to look over the menus.  We both decided on a burger and had our order in.  I decided that I would give their lemonade a try.  When you say it is made fresh, why not?  I had to add some sugar to the lemonade as it was a bit tart for my liking, but that's why there are sugar packets on the table.  Our burgers had finally arrived and we dug in.  I had ordered the BBQ cheddar burger with and upgrade of tots.  The BBQ cheddar consists of a sirloin burger patty topped with some cheddar cheese.  The BBQ sauce goes under the patty which was a bit odd and made for a mess.  This also comes with fried onion sprigs.  Basically broken apart onion rings.  You also get your old standbys; lettuce, tomato, pickle.  Overall, the burger was great on the way down.  The tots were nice and crispy.  Now, I am not placing any blame here, but later that evening me and my better half both got sick.  This was the only thing I had ate the whole day.",

My fiance and I who have been of age for years now got hassled by the waiter and then the manager because my fiance had changed her hair color. They continued to say they didn't mean to offend us but they did. There's no apologizing for that, do not hassle customers who are of age just because your servers are not doing their jobs correctly. Second, I had ordered a beer that I am very familiar with and know the taste. In this case I did not receive the beer that I ordered, if you have old beer people are going to realize. The taste is not the same, beer does go bad, keep your inventory up to date and good. And lastly do not try complimenting us when we are given the check, shit service will not get a good tip even if you are a kiss ass towards the end.",

Now all I have to do is remember it always and hope it's on tap forever! For the record, it's called the Fawn and let's pray it stays around!  My go to is always the Dried Cranberry Almond Chicken Salad Panini. A mouthful, I know. But it is also a mouthful of goodness too! I love me some chicken salad sammiches, and they do it right here! A great combo of chicken & mayo, crushed inside a toasty panini. Talk about creature of habit, but I can't not get this when I go here!   This location is larger than you'd expect from the outside. I guess because once you walk in, you're greeted by a large bar and then you must walk down a hallway of booths to get to a larger back room. While this one might not be as fancy as the Bistro on Penn, it's consistent, and I always appreciate a consistent restaurant!",

I know this place is expensive but seriously charging for a shitty fruit dish on a kids meal is where I draw the line.  They also charge $3 for a TINY kids milk with NO REFILLS and the fries taste like the frozen one you get precut in bags at Walmart.  What happened to the Belgian frites?  And last but not least their iced tea is from a fountain and not fresh brewed.    I've been coming to sharp edges for years (the crafton site was my hangout) but I think I'm done.  The price gouging and horrible service doesn't make up for the fact that they carry some expensive European beers.  The sharp edge used to be great but now it sucks.  Really sucks!",

One bartender was extremely polite but dropped the ball on multiple occasions and didn't wash his hands after his smoke break or after carrying a quad of beer glasses from the inside. Ew. Second one was more aware but lacked general motivation. Fries were cold. Drinks were overpriced and I think mine had turned. I get its a beer spot so I was willing to excuse that even though it tasted like it had been open for 2 weeks. Ambience was meh.  There was a game on so that helped. Other food was ok. But I can't go back. I was annoyed and frustrated by the time I left for a number of reasons, which rarely happens since I'm a server and I get it. But Pittsburgh just has too many awesome restaurants to eat at to spend time here unless you know somebody. So disappointed.",

They have amazing food and beer... Good enough that we put up with the terrible service over and over again.   In recent memory I had the bartender that would not let me order another drink, because she had already run my tab and didn't want to reopen it. The manager that insisted that what I ordered didn't have meat in it (I'm veg and asked about the soup of the day and when it arrived with little bits of bacon I wanted to send it back). And the server that spilled a whole glass of water on someone at our table and didn't really care.  I ended up paying for the soup anyways and not eating it, FYI you can't send anything back without having to pay for it anyways.  So, long story short ask for Rasheika, and good luck.",

    "text": "We went there for a friend's birthday and after reading the menu online, I was so excited for the dinner!  However, unfortunately I was drastically disappointed.    We started off the night with the Mediterranean Nachos.  They were the highlight of the meal, and still somehow lackluster.  They take pita triangles, deep fry them, pile them up and then pour cheesy spinach artichoke dip all over with tomatoes and olives.  It's basically your classic spinach artichoke dip appetizer served in a different manner.  It wasn't bad, just nothing to write home about.  For dinner I had the Abbey Burger which was a sirloin and veal burger that supposedly had roasted garlic involved and a red pepper aioli.  The bun was somehow magically white, like entirely.  Crust and inside.  I felt like I was eating one of those buns you buy at the grocery store that needs to be browned in the oven, that was never browned.  The burger was supposed to be cooked medium, but was solidly well done, very firm, and the veal was not reflected in the taste at all.  Honestly, I've had better burgers at McDonald's.  There was a small dime size amount of aioli that I couldn't even taste.  I upcharged for the sweet potato fries and were disappointed to find them limp and cold.  The waitress was very nice when I asked for a new bunch (I was really looking forward to those fries) and the replacement order was fresh, hot and crispy.  We wanted to watch the Penguins game after dinner so we moved out to the bar area.  I was surprised that there were some TV's at the bar, but not as many as I would expect in a sports loving team in Pittsburgh.  It wasn't very crowded for us, but on a big game day it might get a little tough to get a good view.    The service was very good.  We had a large group and the waitress was totally okay with separate checks.  Our glasses were never empty and she checked back often.  Overall, while the service was good, the food left me wanting much more.  I do not plan on coming back for more than a beer.",

The receiver of the wine didn't want to embarrass the server so they drank it.  I ordered their mussels ; ( the sauce was no more than hot sauce with butter that would go on wings and some blue cheese.  Mussels are a very delicate meat so it was like a pot of hot sauce and blue cheese since the Mussels were over powered.  A good chef would not allow unopened mussels to be served to a customer since they could make the person eating them sick since they could of been dead before process. There were 3 unopened and since it was advertised a pound it was not.  The food all came out at different times, salads forgotten... most said their food was good or ok.  When the different issues where brought to the server he said I'll let the chef know!!!  A server should know red wines from white wines... Beer selections were good but he really didn't know them.    We where the only customers there at the time in the dining area... Don't know if I would go back..",

The food was decent the frites were definitely not frites but just standard American french fries.  I found it nothing to write home about and the drinks were a bit pricey.",

    "text": "I am very familiar with the Sharp Edge brand, however, last night was my first time visiting the little Sharp Edge Bistro in Sewickley. Embarrassingly, I had looked for this Sharp Edge before, never knew that it wasn't on the main drag , and constantly thought I was overlooking it. I started to think Sharp Edge Sewickley was a figment of my imagination! It does exist though, tucked back down an offshoot from beaver Street. There is a huge parking lot out back-bonus right there since Sewickley parking, well, sucks generally. My friend and I made our way inside and I'm not sure if there wa smore in the back but this place was teeny tiny. Besides the bar, there were maybe 5 or 6 high top tables in the bar area. The tables were way too small to even fit two people's things on it so next time I come here, I'll just sit at the bar. Unlike some of the other reviews mentioned, we had good service. She did mention it was only her 2nd day on the job and, although she had to ask her trainer a couple of questions, she was friendly and prompt throughout the meal. I had an over the edge beer (love the over the edge mussells and highly recommend those as well) and my companion doesn't drink, usually, so he stuck with water. I ordered the roast beef and brie paninni (roast beef, brie, carmelized onions, horseradish sauce). I chose fries as my side because I love the thick steak frites they serve. The sandwich was really tasty-the bread was lightly toasted, the roast beef cooked rare and thinly sliced, the brie melted in my mouth, and the horseradish gave it a nice kick. Only complaint would be the onions-they were not cooked thoroughly enough and were borderline raw. It was fine picking them off the sandwich because there weren't that many but still for a $12 sandwich, I'd expect slightly better. My friend ordered the garlic burger special and it came with garlic cheese fries. If you enjoy garlic (and don't plan to be around human beings for the subsequent 5 hours), I'd recommend getting it, although it is just a special. I tried both a bite of the burger and a couple of fries and just be forewarned-very, very garlicky. Now that I know where Sharp Edge in Sewickley is I'll be back soon, at least for drinks if nothing else.",
