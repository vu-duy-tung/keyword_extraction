However, this place is not my fave in Pittsburgh, nowhere close. I would rank, Smiling Banana Leaf, Thai Cuisine, Green Mango and then may be BB. Well, after that remains the blah places (ahem Thai Place). In our latest venture, we asked for an 8, for each of our entrees. One tasted like a 3 another like a zero. The flavors were good, but nothing be wow-ing about, specially at that price-point. I think BB tries too hard to be the \"upscale\" Thai place and misses out on the \"good food\" part. I say focus on the food, not the frills.",

    "text": "I visited with a friend last night and had a pretty good experience here.  The atmosphere is nice, it wasn't too loud, we were seated with no wait (around 7pm) and as another reviewer mentioned, their flatware is pretty darn cool.  The only thing that bugged me is that the lights kept flickering, but that's a pretty minor gripe.  The service was attentive without being intrusive.  Some of the appetizers seem pretty pricey, but it's only $3.50 for two spring rolls which were pretty good.  We split a pumpkin curry and the bean thread noodles, both with tofu.  I usually like my tofu crispier and pan-seared on the outside and theirs looked like it had barely touched the pan.  I also thought the sauce on the bean thread noodles was pretty bland and sparse.  But the pumpkin was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the noodles were generally pretty good.  I've also tried a panang curry, which was delicious but the spice level of 6 was a bit much for me, and the pad thai, which was ok but a little bland.  It seems like the curries have much more flavors than the noodles, so maybe keep that in mind when ordering.  The total for the spring rolls and 2 entrees was $31 before tip.  Even though I wasn't blown away by the food, I am looking forward to coming back to try more.",

    "text": "I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants, and Bangkok Balcony is a favorite in Pittsburgh.  Being a pumpkin lover, my first choice was obvious--the tofu pumpkin curry! And a good choice it was. Thick, hearty, very pumpkiny, and very spicy. Usually 8/10 is a comfortable level of spice for me, but this definitely got my sinuses going. No complaints from me! The portion was large and the dish was very heavy. The tofu helped to balance it out a little, but I still had a lot to take home. Still, this had to be one of my favorite Thai dishes anywhere, ever.  Another of my favorites here is the mussel fritters. It's basically a bunch of deep fried mussels on a bed of beansprouts with a Pad Thai-like sauce. Delicious!  Their Panang curry, unfortunately, is thin and bland, and I also wasn't too impressed with the fresh spring rolls. They weren't terrible, but you can get much better at most other Thai places in the 'burgh. But the pumpkin curry...! I gotta give the place props.",

    "text": "My family and I were looking for a last-minute place to dine after our trip to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History one evening.  We had never been to Bangkok Balcony and decided to give it a try.  I was impressed not only with the food, but also the service, the facilities and the atmosphere.  Our server was very efficient and friendly; our food arrived in a timely manner and all the dishes were excellent.  We all eat Thai food fairly often and we thought this cuisine was up there with the best.  During the early part of our meal, the whole restaurant was entertained by two dancers dressed in traditional costume and dancing to recorded music.  Although I've never experienced live dancing in a Thai restaurant before, I thought the music and dance to be very calming and an enjoyable addition to our evening.  Finally, the restroom facilities were clean and hygienic, which I find to be very telling of the type of management.  My only caveat worth mentioning was that the lighting was incredibly dim; it made for a difficult reading of the menu.  But that's hardly a drawback considering the rest of our meal was so pleasant.  Overall, it was a great experience and I'd recommend it to any of my friends who are in the area.",

Portions are on the small side and the restaurant is pretty noisy. I've been there at least 3 times. The service can be uneven to the point of really horrible.  It's also not the freshest or most authentic Thai food in the city. The Massaman curry had a strange sour taste. The green curry was a little better. The coconut soup was okay, but was an extremely small portion. The pad thai was not bad, but I don't go to a restaurant to eat street food. It was the typical oily sweet mess of noodles you find it most places. I would not recommend this place for a romantic dinner.",

    "text": "Bangkok Balcony may be deserving of 3 stars, but the fact that it's been voted best Thai in Pittsburgh - well, we expected more.  Crab Rangoon, one of the popular apps was devoid of any crab flavor or noticeable chunks.  Instead, it was mostly just cream cheese.  And it's accompanied by the typical out-of-the-bottle neon orange corn syrup sauce.  Would it be that hard to mix up an original dipping sauce?  Green Curry with Thai Spaghetti was tasty, but the noodles seemed overcooked and mushy.  Unless they are supposed to be that way, it didn't add anything to the dish.   The curry was good, with a fair amount of shrimp included.  My wife had the Tofu with Eggplant, and it too was pretty tasty, but not special.  The tofu seemed overly fried, with no tenderness.    As far as Thai goes - this is just your average Thai place.  What makes it Best in the Burgh is still a mystery to us.  We don't really see the need to go back - especially since the prices really don't reflect the quality of the food.",

We asked if they had BYOB since we were actually planning to go to a BYOB restaurant, but the cork fee was $15 so it wasn't worth it. They do have a nice bar, so that's completely understandable. I got the usual, and now I kind of consider myself a pumpkin curry expert since it's the 4th place I have sampled it in PGH. My boyfriend got a sweet potato basil curry with chicken. Both of our heat levels were pretty weak, I ordered a 5 and got more like a 2, and boyfriend agreed. But overall the food was quite yummy, although mine literally had only 2-3 pieces of tofu, which was kind of disappointing.  I would definitely come back here though!",

    "text": "Bangkok Balcony is located in Squirrel Hill.  If you're walking on Forbes Avenue, hang a left at 5846, and head upstairs.  I can remember my first time there; I didn't expect to see a larger sized restaurant.  Seating capacity is around 75 people, with additional chairs at the bar.  The atmosphere is nice and uncomplicated- if you get a seat near the window you can people-watch everyone on the Avenue below.  The decor is nice, but not memorable.  My impression was that more attention was paid to the seating layout rather than space and interior design.  We ordered drinks first; a ginger ale for me (lame right?) and a blood-orange martini for my girlfriend.  The martini was excellent- very tart and strong; no skimping on the vodka here!  We also ordered an appetizer; Fresh Rolls- fried tofu, rice noodles, carrots, lettuce, mint basil, and rice paper served with brown dipping sauce and crushed peanuts.  I've had fresh rolls (or spring rolls) at many different restaurants, and these were just ok.  The one thing that really stood out was the thickness of the rice paper.  They were difficult to cut...too many sheets of rice paper.  Summer rolls should be light and fresh...and easy to eat, these were not.  That being said, the sauce was good.  For our entrees: Praram Chicken; grilled chicken on a bed of steamed spinach with peanut curry sauce.  My girlfriend ordered the Green Curry Veggie Style:  broccoli, green beans, snow peas, eggplant, basil leaf, and bell pepper in a coconut milk and green curry sauce.  The chicken tender, and moist.  The spinach was flash sauteed, and not overdone.  What I really love about this dish is the addictiveness of the peanut sauce.  It has a bold flavor with hints of coconut and ginger.  The green curry was equally good.  In lieu of meat, my girlfriend decided to add tofu.  The tofu absorbed the flavors of the sauce quite well, as did the vegetables.  Her entree was also served with white rice that was cooked to a satisfactory doneness- not too mushy, with the grains of rice easily separating.  There are many choices here, especially if you're a vegetarian.  If you're a non-meat-eater you may want to consider: Spicy Tofu with Mixed Vegetables $11.95, Praram Tufu $10.95, Tofu Eggplant with Basil Leaf $11.95, Tofu Platter $11.95, and the Tofu with Bell Pepper Dish $11.95.  When ordering, be sure to specify degree of spiciness, from 1 to 10.  The wait staff at Bangkok Balcony is competent, just unenthusiastic.  Our orders were taken in a timely manner, and the food arrived correctly, but there just seemed to be something missing- almost as if they were disinterested and ready to leave before they started their shift.  The food at Bangkok balcony is good.  I wish they could re-work those Fresh Rolls!  Overall our experiences at this restaurant have been nice.  The food is consistently good, and you can always count on getting a table if you arrive before 6pm. Bangkok Balcony 5846 Forbes  Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15217-1602 (412) 521-0728",

At $14/entree and with 6 very hungry people, this was a huge disappointment.   What we had:   - coconut soup - lemongrass soup - basil leaf stir-fry - ginger stir-fry - panang curry - pineapple curry - rad-na - tofu eggplant with basil leaf  My gripes:   1. Coconut soup was too salty to be edible.  2. Tofu was the deep-fried kind, which meant it was dry and rubbery.   3. Curry was watery and thin, with barely a cup of vegetables per entree. For $14 an entree, this was totally unacceptable. Getting full by eating rice drowned in watery curry is not my idea of a good meal, even at half the price.   4. Stir-fries all tasted exactly the same. At one point, I thought we had ordered two ginger stir-fries. Then halfway through the meal, we found noodles in one of them - this, apparently, was the rad-na noodle dish. Same exact dish, but with noodles. Take note, y'all, this is THE definition of lazy cooking.   Conclusion: Avoid avoid avoid.",

If you want to reach for your drink every bit or so, you'll need an 8 or a 9. Our Thai server told us that she usually orders a 15, but that it does give her some heartburn.

The quality of the food, speed food takes They're very consistent when it comes to quality of food and quick, attentive service.   Recommendations: See Ew noodles are amazing. I usually get 6 for spicy with tofu as my protein (the tofu are like sponges for the sauce) and it's simply delicious.    Green Curry is also great, especially if you love eggplant! Ask for extra eggplant, though, because they don't put a lot normally.",

Maybe I am just spoiled from Smiling Banana Leaf, but this Thai food was just ehh. I ordered the Fresh Rolls and pumpkin curry with tofu, very spicy level. The rolls were okay. The curry however was not spicy whatsoever, there were 3 pieces of \"pumpkin\" which actually had no taste or color (like its typical yellow/green) and could very well have just been potatoes. The tofu is the airy kind that holds no flavor. Bottom line, I will not get Thai food here anymore and would be willing to make the trek across town to Smiling Banana Leaf. I guess I will give the other Thai restaurants in Sq Hill a try first.",

We were seated near the black tinted window and the lighting made it all feel cozy but a little like we were warped back in time. Also the silverware I was not a fan of (they look like fiddlesticks which are ugly to me!). Anyway...  I couldn't decide between the yellow and mussaman curry so I asked the waitress. She said the yellow curry was good but on the sweet side and then her eyes totally lit up when she spoke about the mussaman curry, which was more of an Indian curry and of thicker consistency. I was sold on her description for mussaman and another friend actually changed her mind to order this too. By how excited our waitress was for us, we knew we were in for a treat.  Out came a pot of the mussaman curry and a bowl of rice. While the volume looks small, the contents are quite filling. The curry was absolutely delicious (I had a spice level of 5), not too sweet with a peanut coconut curry taste in potatoes and chicken. The potatoes were soft but the chicken was just the tiniest bit overcooked however once I smothered some of the curry sauce I ate it all up. Actually I ended up eating the whole thing up by putting the curry sauce on everything even though I was full!  Pleasant experience with the service and extremely satisfied with my dish that I will venture back.",

The fresh rolls were very good, but I'm not sure if I should trust that the curry is vegan despite her saying numerous times it is ok for me...she said the same about the salad. There are Thai places around Pittsburgh that are certified vegan friendly by Vegan Pittsburgh and clearly this is not one of those places.",

    "text": "COLD/WARM EXPENSIVE/WEAK  The above four words pretty much express how we felt after our dinner experience on Thursday evening, June 2, 2016.  First the cold:  {and expensive}  Ordered the Thai spring roll--deep fried and cut at an angle in half--perhaps to hide their small size at $3.95 for two.  When their cut before serving they tend to cool a little faster. Ordered the Praram Chicken ($16.95) over spinach and smothered in some kind of peanut sauce.  This dish arrive luke warm-cold and the serving looked like a lunch portion.  It was tasty but not much there and I could have made this dish at home.  They didn't sautee the spinach but put a thin layer of raw spinach under the chicken.  My dinner partner ordered the chicken satay ($7.95) for five.  He said it was ok but had better elsewhere.  He also had the chili paste chicken ($14.95) with more green beans than chicken.  Again middle of the road where you could have ordered the same thing at one of those asian restaurants with pictures on the walls and more chicken and at a cheaper rate.  Weak:  We both had Jasmine Tea which arrived in a cup with hot water and a tea bag--very weak tea and required at least two tea bags each per cup to make it strong enough to taste.  Asked the waitress if there were free refills and she said \"Yes, I can bring you more hot water.\"  I thought I misunderstood her and when we ordered more tea she said she would bring the hot water.  I explained the tea was very weak when she said you only get one tea bag of FOOJOY tea [$9.99 per 100] per person.  She finally gave in and brought us a small teapot of hot water with tea bags.  Does this restaurant need to nickel and dime guests over cheap/weak tea bags?  Warm:  Ever heard of AIR CONDITIONING Bangkok Balcony?  It was warm and humid that evening and there wasn't evening air circulating from any vents.  Maybe they are trying to keep their electric bill low.  I don't know about you, but I like to dine in a comfortable climate controlled environment especially at these prices.  Total bill $52.22 for two!!!",

The dishes are good but cost a nickel under $14 which is a bit expensive for a stir-fry dish. On my most memorable visit, I ordered a daily special which was served as a whole fish over rice with a Thai chili sauce. The presentation of the dish was rather surprising as they served an entire fish (head and all) as opposed to a fillet which caught me off guard.  One of the convenient aspects of the restaurant is that you can rate how spicy you would like the dish on a scale of 1 to 10.  There is also window seating available where you can overlook Forbes Ave while having dinner.  All in all, Bangkok Balcony is a nice and intimate restaurant but a bit expensive for the type of food they are serving.",

I spit the dumpling out, and threw the rest away. They tasted like an old mildewy dishrag or something. One of the foulest things I've ever tasted. Seriously.  It was our first experience with Bangkok Balcony. We got takeout, and my first impressions of the place were good. The hostess was nice, and the bartender who gave me my food was also really nice. It looked like a great atmosphere for dinner, as well, so I left the restaurant excited to try their food and already thinking about coming back to dine in.  Then I had to ruin it by eating the food:(  Perhaps we should've gone with one of their curries that had good reviews on here, but I just wanted something simple last night. I got pad thai, and It was okay, but definitely not worth going back for, and I didn't even finish it (a rarity for me, as I usually finish my meal AND whatever meal my wife orders).  We also ordered the fresh spring rolls and dumplings. I already discussed the disaster that was the dumpling order, and while the spring rolls were okay, I'm not sure I'd order them again IF I ever go back. They were poorly rolled and the tofu inside was so ridiculously big that all you could taste...was tofu. One positive was that their brown dipping sauce was good enough to get you through any bland spring roll you could ever encounter.  Overall, it's going to be a tough pull to get me to go back. I'd hate to hinge that decision on something as simple as pad thai, dumplings, and fresh spring rolls when their curries get such good reviews. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the mood for a curry last night, and just wanted a basic first taste of Bangkok Balcony...and that first taste was thoroughly disappointing.",

My only complaint is that with this particular curry, the chicken comes in larger pieces and is sometimes dry/overcooked. When we ordered this past week, however, the chicken was perfect.   My fiance loves their pineapple chicken curry, and with his the chicken is sliced thinly so he doesn't ever run into this problem. His only complaint is that I order it too much!   For the few times we have gone in to eat, the service has been very friendly!",

Given the location, number of positive reviews, and number of diners I always see there, I expected, at a minimum, a decent meal. However, I was sorely disappointed. First of all, this place is way overpriced: $14 for panang curry (of a minuscule portion size) and $4 for two measly spring rolls. Also, there was a $2.25 extra charge for getting brown instead of white rice. (Yikes!) This is Pittsburgh for god's sake. Secondly, the quality of the food was laughable. The curry was watery, the vegetables were sparse, and the tofu was rubbery and tasted like old gym socks.   On the plus side, the service was good. But, all things considered, I would definitely recommend that you pass on this place.",

Especially after having such great eats at places like Nicky's Thai Kitchen and the Smiling Banana Leaf.    Pad thai... dry and no flavor.  WE figured they would have gotten one of our orders right and at least one of them would have been tasty... well that was not the case.   Their steamed dumplings were dry, inedible and just downright nasty.... one bite and we tossed them away.    The only redeeming part of the meal was the fresh spring rolls which were at best, decent.    I won't be going back here after our experience.  Like I said, with better Thai options in town, it makes sense to continue to go there at this point as they have always been good and never failed us.",

Pumpkin has a texture that's better than sweet potato, potato, carrots, or taro for a perfect marriage with thai curry that will never ever end in divorce. If that EVER happens, I will be one VERY unhappy child.  One negative is the silverware. The head of the forks and spoons in my hand outweight the mass of the food, leaving me unsatisfied.

    "text": "I remember when Bangkok Balcony still opened. I was a college student at CMU, right down Forbes Avenue. Lemongrass used to be in that location, and it was pretty good. So, I was wondering what the new place would bring. Well, at that point I was pleasantly surprised by the renovated restaurant still making good use of the 2nd floor windows overlooking Forbes Avenue. The food was tasty and, coupled with the fact that it was close by, I remember coming here all the time. Someone's birthday? Bangkok Balcony! Stress Relief from Finals? Bangkok Balcony! Hungry and Procrastinating? Bangkok Balcony!   I went back for the first time in many years this past week and was let down. The food just wasn't what I remembered it to be. It's still okay, and for someone who doesn't walk in with high expectations, it probably will do. I had a very safe dish - the Penang Curry, which was decent but there are better ones in Pittsburgh (Thai Cuisine in Liberty, for one). The rice wasn't really that good either - and really, how do you f*&k up rice? Two of my dining friends had the Pad See Ew, which they really didn't like. One of them said \"it tastes sour, like vinegar.\" While I'm no expert about what ingredients should go into Pad See Ew, the look on her disappointed face told me the vinegar taste was not appreciated.   Overall I would give it 3 stars because I think a lot of the experience was tainted by high expectations. Even tho I still like the location and feel of the restaurant, I don't think I'll be going back because I just don't want to waste a good meal. I can enjoy myself much more with the Pad Thai from Spice Island, or the curry from Thai Cuisine.   Oh - and yes I admit that I have f*%&ed up rice before, but I don't cook and make other people pay to eat it. Restaurants don't have the same leeway!",

I was disappointed that most of the clothing stores were closed, because there was such a great mix of vintage and new fashions.   I digress. I really liked the layout of BB... how it's on the top floor and everything is modern without being sterile. We both really liked the flatware they use here, and that's something we almost never comment on. They had a good selection of tofu items and I loved how they asked me to tell them how spicy I wanted my food \"on a scale from one to ten.\" The food here is also more inexpensive than I would have thought, seeing how packed the place was and how nicely decorated.   Overall, it was good, but I'm biased -- I love Thai food so much that I could eat it all the time. The reason I'm only giving this place three stars is because we both felt a little sick later on in the evening.",

On top of all of this, the Balcony sits mightily atop Norka Futon, meaning there are four \"tables for two\" that give diners a nice view of Forbes avenue below them, meaning you can enjoy your food with a nice dose of people-watching.  For the year I lived in Squirrel Hill, the Balcony was one of my main eating locales (especially since they're open a little later than most Pittsburgh restaurants tend to stay open), and even after moving away from there, I still eat at the Balcony with some regularity.  Although the Balcony has been around for a while and has undergone multiple owners now (and several different variations in menu design), their food has remained pretty much the same - which is a good thing!  Their core curries and Thai noodle/rice dishes are presented well and taste flavorful without being overwhelmingly greasy.  Their more exotic fare, although sometimes less filling, are often presented even more nicely and taste just as good.  All of the food is brought on oval plates with serving utensils, which sit on your table in addition to everyones' own dinner plates, encouraging sharing of dishes among the party.  Their drinks (Thai Ice Tea and Coffee, and various juices including mango) are a nice treat for fans of Thai beverages.  With reasonable prices and a short walk down the stairs to walk off the meal afterwards, there's not much more one can ask for.",

A friend recommended this place and I quickly hopped in the car at the prospect of getting some \"Thai Food.\" I got the Green Curry and it was awesome. My friend group agrees, the spicy-ness scale is a little mild. I got a 5/10 and it wasn't at all hot, which was only disappointing for a second.   Plenty of great apps to choose from: old stand-bys like crab Rangoon and miso soup and some pretty elaborate lettuce wraps. Large selection of features for the more adventurous while maintaining a wide array of the dishes you come to expect like Pad Thai, See Ew, Curry, etc.   It's like 13.95 a dish, but if you're a petite eater it's two meals. If you eat like I do it's one glorious chow down that is well worth it.",

They have always welcomed large parties and have been happy to separate our checks. Their drinks are on point. We had a round while deciding what we were going to have. Everyone on our side of the table went for Pad Thai. Their Pad Thai is one of my top 3 in the Burgh. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice yet they nail my spice level every time. The portion is huge. I think it was the first time I conquered the whole dish. I hadn't eaten that day and I was starving. The other side of our table leaned toward a range of curry lovers. It got so quiet when our food came. We dove right in. Eventually people started asking if others wanted to try their dishes. Sometimes you don't want to share. This is one of those times. However you do want people to see what you are living so much. It's the crunch of the peanuts with the softness of the noodles, with the zing of the lime, and that small tang of cilantro. It's a great bite.  Their staff is very friendly and the service is great.",

I don't eat much Thai food, so the descriptions made it easy for me to decide what I might like. I ended up choosing not to venture out and just ordered the Beef Pad Thai. It was really good! My only disappointment was that I ordered it spicy level 8 and it wasn't spicy at all... My friend ordered the Chicken Thai Style Rice, and it was also really good!   Overall, prices were reasonable. Service was quick and all the employees were helpful and polite. The atmosphere was relaxing. The view over Forbes Ave. was cool though it wasn't anything special. I'd definitely recommend.",

My favorites are the red curry, the pad thai, the thai fried rice. Recently we tried the fried fish in chilli sauce, it was a bit pricy (18$) but the fish was very nicely cooked and tender&delicious to taste. I am also a fan of their thai iced teas. I like the seating area, the ambience is trendy as well as casual. Overall, a really good Thai restaurant in Squirrel Hill.",

First we waited in our seats 15 minutes before being helped.  The food was also bad (I can't even say mediocre). My dish was cold and the meat that was supposed to be beef was not identifiable as any type of meat.  The beans were barely cooked not al dente but almost raw.  After we finished our meal, we waited another 15 minutes to get our check. Actually we never got our check .  But when we started walking toward the door they gave it to me.  (I have never done it, but I almost would have walked out without paying.)  Try the other great Thai places in Squirrel Hill unless they get their act together again.",

The service was also really good.  The food was ok. I got the shrimp pad thai, which is kind of what I get at every Thai restaurant. It tasted pretty typical.

At first I was disappointed by the portions but I was pleasantly surprised by how filling the meal was.

We ordered the lunch specials , garlic pork for me and ginger pork for my husband.

In spite of the beautiful veggies and tender pork on both dishes, they had no flavor. We had ordered spice levels of 6 & 7 and there was zero spice in either dish.

Now, not that it was awful, it just was completely bland, without flavor, and with pork that was just a touch chewy. In fact, if I had never had Thai food before and this was my first exposure to it, I'd never eat it again.   The ginger pork was like eating soggy cardboard. I always like spicy Thai. This had no spice and no flavor. The salad, soup, and spring roll apps were ok. But the main entree? No thanks.   There are FAR better places to get your Thai cravings satisfied.

I was with my family and I asked to the bartender something and he went like Ask your server...  then the food took over 45 min to get on the table; when we six were the only ones in the restaurant at the time plus  a table of two behind us.  My father in low was no happy with his meal and he drove over 5 hours to eat in this place. On top, whenever the server came for the order I asked him to give me his best dish... he brought me Some fish dish.. I got two bites...  it was to blend.   But not done.... you guys included the tip on the bill! However and over what you charge us we decided to put some cash on the table.  To many mistakes in just one party! Sorry to say. No coming back.  It was April 29. 2018.",

Reservations are accepted but it wasn't busy when we stopped on a Sunday night. Staff was very professional and polite. They had Thai dancers performing in the dining room which created a fun atmosphere but it was still intimate and not distracting to those having a quiet meal.   The portions were large and I had plenty f leftovers to take home. The shrimp and tofu red curry was perfectly spices for me at a 4 on a scale of 3-10. Red curry is my favorite and I always order it anytime I eat Thai food. While I thought it was good here, I do prefer it elsewhere where I have had it with more vegetables and pineapple which I find to be a perfect contrast to the spice. I would probably not get this again if I return. I also had the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer which had a nice presentation, but I found to be slightly dry.   Overall, I probably will go elsewhere if I find myself craving Thai cuisine, but if I am in the area, I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again.",

Second PSA: the setting sun cuts into eye level - avoid the east wall around that time.  Ok now to dive into the rest of my experience: the service was on the slow side. I actually think they intended to bring our wine at the same time as our food, which I find a little weird. Either that or they forgot about the wine until I reminded them. Not sure.  I ordered the curry fried rice with tofu (my favorite thing to order at Thai restaurants). The fried rice was good except...there was tomato in it. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on Thai food, maybe tomato is a normal thing to put in fried rice, but I really did not like it. Something about hot tomato just didn't mesh with the rest of the dish.  They have a lot of things on their menu, and I'm happy about the wine. I'll probably come again in the future!",

    "text": "This was my first time my room mate and I tried Bangkok Balcony. We each got the green curry with pork, one a spicy level 0 and one a spicy level 4.   The curry was delicious! However the curry with a spicy level 0 was NOT a 0. I called to ask the restaurant if there was a possibility that they maybe made them both 4s or something and they said no. When I explained to them that the 0 shouldn't have been as spicy as it was, the woman on the phone told me, \"that's just how Thai food is. It's all spicy.\"  I get Thai food a LOT. So much so that I'm surprised I haven't turned into a giant bowl of curry tbh. I'm talking twice a week on the regular. I've gotten curry at a spicy level 3 that was less spicy than their 0! When I explained to her that if I ordered a spicy level 0 I should have at least been informed that it was still going to be as spicy as it was, she didn't want to hear any of it. She told me it would take forever for them to remake it for me and deliver it to me again (I got delivery) which I was fine with, as long as I got food the way I wanted it. When I said I was okay with that, it turned out that she wasn't okay with it.   She then tried to completely deter me from getting the order remade. She said their curry is automatically a spicy level 3 and that they can't make it a 0. Why didn't you tell me this when I ordered a spicy level 0? She said I was supposed to assume that it was going to be spicy. Well, when I ordered a spicy level 0, I did not assume it was going to be a 3. That makes no sense.  Eventually someone else got on the phone, I'm assuming the manager, and told me they would remake the food and send it out to me no problem. I appreciated that, after verbally debating over my order with the first person I talked to on the phone.   I work in the service industry. I know how the cookie crumbles when it comes to these kinds of situations. I had to ask for half of my order refunded until they offered to remake it for me. That should have been their first go-to decision.   And lo and behold, the spicy level 0 was significantly less spicy than the one I first ordered. Who would have thought?",

Service was good until the very end, when the waitress left me sitting with the bill waiting to pay. The food was excellent; I had the panang curry with beef, and he had the fried rice with pork. Plus, our entrees came with appetizers of soup, salad, and crispy roll. You know it's an upscale Asian restaurant when they have reusable (plastic) chopsticks rather than disposable ones. They even boxed up our leftovers for us. Word to the wise: if you only sorta like spicy food, 2/10 is plenty. 10/10 must be for fire-eaters!",

Lots of takeout whilst wee were there so your experience will hopefully be better. But there is just too, too much awesome food in that stretch for me to take another chance on this place.

The soup they give you isn't like the soup you usually get in other lunch specials. The portion is bigger than usual and it also has little tofu bits in it too. I was pretty full before my entree came! Sadly, I didn't really like the Panang curry. It was a little too creamy and thick, and this kinda masked the curry taste. My friend also got the curry fried rice. Taste-wise, it was just okay, but he was shocked by the excessive amount of oil left on his plate after he finished his meal..   That being said, I would probably still come back to Bangkok Balcony for a cheap, mediocre Thai fix. Just don't expect too much when you come here.

While these aren't the best I've ever had, they are fresh, crisp and tasty. I'm not sure how I feel about the rolls being served cut up (I'm used to getting the whole roll), but that doesn't effect flavor so I'm not that worried about it).   My standard is the Yellow Curry. Chicken and Sweet Potatoes stewed in a fantastic yellow curry sauce and served with rice. The chicken is always tender, while the sweet potatoes provide a great contrast to the wonderful curry sauce. If it weren't frowned upon, I'd probably lick my bowl.   My wife ordered from the Main Course menu - an item simply referred to as \"Garlic\". This Thai stir fry has chicken (your choice of meat) plus veggies in a garlic sauce and rice. The meal is light and simple, but still satisfying.   Overall the service was quite good. Servers were friendly and attentive, while also helpful with questions.   I will often do takeout (lunch or dinner), as the restaurant can get kinda crowded.",

    "text": "Amazing curries and unique decor - this place was perfect for a cozy winter dinner. Definitely a nicer Thai restaurant, there are cloth napkins, fancy silverware, and paper tablecloths. The service was great - they were attentive and helpful.   The whole restaurant is nicely decorated and there is a small bar toward the back. The coolest seating, though, is along the front window overlooking Forbes Ave. It's a pretty cool view, looking out OR in! The window seats are only tables for two, though. Good date spot!  We ordered several of the curry dishes - massaman and panang were my favorites. These dishes had a great coconut milk and fish sauce flavor - classic Thai tastes. The yellow curry was more like an Indian curry and made for great winter comfort food. We also tried the curry fried rice. The flavor was unique and I liked it better than typical fried rice - there were a lot of vegetables and tofu mixed in, so it could really be an entree itself. It was quite greasy though.   You can order all the dishes with a variety of protein options. Vegetarians should note that even if you order tofu or veggies, a lot of dishes probably have fish sauce. If that's a concern, they have a section of vegetarian meals on the menu!   They offer a spice level of 1-10, though a lot of the dishes with chili paste and curry are 3-4 spiciness to begin with. I like some heat, so 6 was the perfect amount for my panang curry. It was spicy, but I didn't have to drink a gallon of water or anything.   Definitely will come back here for a date night!",

My husband has recently cut out gluten and Thai food can be hit or miss with him but the staff was good with ensuring that our food was gluten free.  We got the pad Thai and the Lemongrass noodles. The lemongrass noodles were similar to a dish I have gotten elsewhere known as Drunken noodle and it was delicious. My husband liked it so much that he ate half my dish. The pad Thai was also really good, it had just the right amount of peanut in it.",

The peanuts had a burnt taste to them and the shrimp was rubbery. Mixed vegetable was ok but thought the portion size could have been a larger. Way overpriced for the quality and portion size. I had better Thai food for half the price. Sad that we had a bad experience because other reviews say otherwise.  Maybe its better if you eat in?",

I had the crab rangoon, chicken cashew, and the lamb curry, and it was all very tasty! The meat is pretty juicy, and not overcooked like many other places often do. Portions aren't super big, so you might want to order more, but everything tastes good, wasn't too heavy, and paired well with one another. The crab rangoon wasn't great thiugh, as it was essentially a fried chip with sauce inside, and not much meat.   I also got a Thai iced tea, and it was pretty nice.  I really liked the service here---waiters were very fast and nice about questions and giving recommendations for food. I will definitely come back to try some of their other menu items.",

Well we went here last night after drinks at HH and I have to say I was very happy with the results.   We had pad Thai and drunken noodles. We asked for both to be gluten free which pad Thai normally should be but drunken noodles often aren't. They said that was no problem.   The pad Thai was the best of the four Squirrel Hill Thai joints in my opinion. I've had the other three in the past month to compare and here's my take on the pad Thai here compared to the others:  1) it's saucier in a good way 2) the noodles are consistent and cooked well, not too chewy and not falling apart 3) the bean sprouts were cooked in not raw on top 4) there was ample peanut 5) the portion was large  The other Thai places miss one or two of those items above.  The drunken noodle was very good as well. And I can confirm that I have reason to believe they really were GF.   I've made my decision, for Thai in SQHill it's gonna be Bangkok Balcony Thai!",

The taste and presentation of the food were great! We ordered the chicken satay appetizer and it came with 2 delicious sauces. The Thai iced tea was a bit too sweet but still yummy and came in a beautiful V-shaped glass. For entrees, our party got the duck curry, seafood banquet and tofu garlic stir fry dish. They each came with rice and every single thing was finished.   That leads me to a few cons: -entree portions were small. It took no effort to finish everything on our plates even with the rice. The rice was also delicious but came in the tiniest bowls. More, please! -no spice level personalization. On their menus, it clearly displays a spice level of 0-10. I asked for zero spice in my duck curry and to have hot sauce or chili oil on the side. The waiter said the minimum spice level is 3. WTF? But when my father in law and husband ordered, they each asked for 2 and the waiter was accommodating. Is it because I'm Asian so they automatically assume I should be able to handle more? What is this? -prices weren't too high but for the portions, they were kind of high. Entrees ranged between 13-18 and appetizers were 6-10.",

You choose what spiciness level you want on an interval scale, from 1-10. I enjoy spicy foods and 6 was a perfect heat. I think any hotter would have affected the taste in a poor way. Anyway, the meal was delicious. Tender chicken and crisp vegetables in a curry/milk bowl. Moderately priced at about 12 dollars for a huge bowl of food. Appetizer was about $7-8.

I judge all my thai food by 1 dish - Panang and this was good but nothing that left me wanting more - may not even order it again from here.  Wife had a tofu dish with basil and eggplant - had good flavor.    Dining room is nice and a little more up-scale.  Still a little over priced but for some reason - dining in Pittsburgh in general is overpriced for the quality and quantity of food.  $40 for 2 entrees, a chicken satay and we picked it up as I dont think they offer delievery.    Portions are average to small but that also seems par for Pittsburgh.  I would go back and would not hesitate to take an out of town guest here.    spicy is on a scale of 1 -10.  I went 5 so I could share my dish... I would say 8 is still being safe if you are looking to share with somone who does not like spicy food.  They dont seem to use chili paste but rather red pepper flakes.  They also have a bar which is a plus.",

We clearly walked in with her burger and after 15 minutes and when our appetizer was served, our waitress stated \"No outside Food\".  Now, if they had told us that upon entry, I would have understood. They do not have a children's menu or any Amercain food.  We were not there for dinner and it was after the ususal lunch rush.   I wanted my daughter to finish her burger and then sit quietly but the waitress was quite rude and told us no outside food again.  We got up and left and too bad they have lost good paying customers in this ecomomy.  We have done this all over the country with our daughter, hopeful she will enjoy Mom's \"smelly food\". We traveled 30 minutes to get Thai Food and will never go again.  BAD customer service. We got up and left!",

But I was proven wrong the minute I was seated by a very attentive and kind waiter.   We ordered green curry with chicken, grilled beef, and steamed rice. The food arrived in a timely manner and they were delicious! I wouldn't say that they were the best Thai food I've ever had, but I really enjoyed them. There's the spiciness level, and we chose an 8 I think. It wasn't  spicy at all for me :p The waiter offered us some chili sauce, which made the meal even tastier. We only ordered 1 steamed rice, and it was certainly plenty for my husband and I.   We went there for dinner, around 6pm. By the time we left the place (8ish), the place was practically full. Everyone dining seemed happy; a good sign, no? I would definitely go here again!",

For what its worth the coconut soup was only marginally better than the basil leaf mainly because I could at least tell that they attempted to season it. The shrimp however were way overcooked to the point of being rubbery and there were only 3 of them in the soup. Next the basil leaf was only \"hot\" when the temperature of the food was; so much for the spice levels. It had no flavor at all and tasted like cheap chinese food which is unfortunate because the dish was not cheap. There you have it $20+ wasted on garbage. Dine at your own risk. If you are looking for Thai food I strongly recommend The Green Mango instead.",

Me and husband are food lovers and we definitely love our Thai but we were so disappointed on the food I had the flat noodle in their \"special\" gravy with shrimp which according to me was not so specially it lacked so much in terms flavor and \"specialness\" a total let down and I mean it I barely ate anything off of that humongous dish they served with sauce pouring down every which way so I thought of having the shrimp which of course you would expect to be deveined if you're getting food in a restaurant but no the shrimp had vein in them which pretty much grossed me out. Then moving on I thought \"let me finish the mushrooms at least since I haven't eaten anything\" I promise the mushrooms didn't have any flavor or seasoning whatsoever it was a piece of rubber in my mouth. The reason I love Thai is flat noodles! But j hardly had any noodles there was just a few pieces of noodles floating in the huge dish of tangy and sour \"special\" sauce and carrots. That's about my dish. My husband ordered the lemongrass noodle with chicken as well know lemongrass itself has an amazing aroma and flavor and in addition to that if you add Napa basil the aroma and flavor would be irresistible but nope! We had to be disappointed the there was no aroma, no flavor and let alone the seasoning and the chicken was so bland I can't even imagine the good thing about my husband's dish was it had noodles unlike mine. I am upset that I didn't get to enjoy their food like everyone else here on yelp.",

Really nice, loungey environment, bustling yet nice intimate lighting and quiet enough to have deep conversations with the person next to you.    My favorite dish is the chicken pad thai (yea i know) and I usually get a 5 on the spicy scale.  I believe if you LOVE spiciness you can ask them to go off the scale all the way up to 15 (instead of 10).  The soft shell crab here is also quite good.

It was wrapped in tin foil (which I knew going in) to preserve flavors, and the inside was also then wrapped in lettuce. To me it didn't look that appealing or exotic. It didn't taste terrible but it wasn't to die for and the portion was pretty small. The bill pretty much topped it off. Although the staff was pleasant and did well enough accommodating the large party, when you have food that doesn't look or taste great, is not a decent portion size (at least compared to other like restaurants in the area), and to top it off is pricey, then there is less incentive to express a positive viewpoint or to give it another chance.",

I got a green curried tofu dish, which was pretty good, but cost almost 15 bucks. I chose a spiciness of 6 and it was perfect, although if I come here again I'd bump it up to a 7 or 8. The staff was all very friendly and the service was great. Overall, though, run-of-the-mill Thai place in Pittsburgh.",

The meal was just ok. the appetizers were disappointing. The fresh rolls had a sticky and thick rice wrap and mostly pale lettuce. Dumplings fair. The dinner curry was good, as was the beef salad. But a noodle dish was not visually appealing and reported to be \"just OK\". The server was attentive. The beer selection and prices were fine. I would go to Pusadee's where the rolls are delicate and full of fresh herbs and the dumplings are beyond compare.",

    "text": "This is the probably best Thai restaurant I have found in Pittsburgh - the Tofu Mussaman Curry is fantastic and the spring rolls are always worth it as well. Never had a bad meal here!  It's on the second floor of a building on Forbes Ave in the heart of Squirrel Hill, and if you get a seat near the big glass windows you get a nice view of the hustle and bustle below. It has a great ambience and the staff has always been friendly.  The reason I deduct a star - last time I was there with a friend who is also a vegetarian, we ordered a tofu pad thai and found a few small pieces of chicken in it. Probably an understandable mistake, but still sort of unnerving. The service and the food was otherwise great, so we didn't make a fuss about it.",

    "text": "Bangkok Balcony = nom.  I've never eaten in here, but I've gotten take out twice and it was awesome both times.  We ordered a ton of food to feed five of us last week, and still enjoyed a few days of leftovers.  We got..... -Thai Spring Rolls (some with chicken, some with shrimp, some veg) - all crunchy and delish. -Coconut Soup (my boyfriend likes it, I didn't try it) -Pad Thai  -See You Noodles -Mussaman Curry -Panang Curry  And everything was really good.  The curries were a huge hit - I loved the mussaman, but everyone else was raving about the panang.  The see-you noodles (Pad See Ew, essenially) were delish, that's one of my favorite standards.  It's pricey, for Thai....well, it's pricey for take out Thai.  Back in Chicago, my boyfriend and I were happily living in the land of $7 curries, and the idea of paying $14 for curry was ridiculous.  I'm bummed that there is no cheaper Thai place near us, so we don't go to Bangkok Balcony as much as I'd like to.  But when parents are in town, or if you want to sit down and really have a dining experience, I think it's worth it.  And it's really high quality and delicious so that makes the price more justifiable.  Sort of.",

It was filled at around 8 when we came in, but we just had to sit at the bar for about 15 minutes and we were shown to a table right by the window.   Definitely try the Thai Iced Tea with coconut milk(?), it's excellent. We started off with the wonton soup, which was really good; there were a lot of good vegetables in it. I had the Panang Curry with pork and I couldn't get enough of it. For every meal, you have to pick how spicy you want it to be on a scale of 1-10. I did a 1, and it was mildly spicy but not bland or anything. The atmosphere was warm and inviting and out waitress was very attentive. The food came quickly for how busy it was. There was no loud music or anything like that. I've been coming here since I was about 12 years old, and it's still my favorite place in Pittsburgh for Asian/Oriental food. Lunch is great, too.",
