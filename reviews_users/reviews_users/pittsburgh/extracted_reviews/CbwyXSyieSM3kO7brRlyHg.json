    "text": "So I was off from work and decided to give this place a shot since I heard they would be close to my house. I pulled up and saw one of the largest lines I've ever seen. I had no idea this place had such a great reputation the line had around 30-40 people. I waited for at least an hour maybe more so I was very hungry by the time I got to order. So I just decided to get both rolls and try them out. Getting both rolls sure didn't come cheap spending $35. Both of the rolls were very good however, for the price the size of the roll I'd say either needs to bigger and more lobster or the tots come with the roll free. Because I spent $35 and I honestly was still a little hungry. I'd definitely go back and try the lobster bisque and I'd order the lobster roll again I liked both of them equally the same. I loved the fact the gave you a fresh lemon wedge too. Definitely nice to have lobster truck here in Pittsburgh as there's seafood is hard to come by.",

Yes, I get that lobster is expensive, but for $15.75, it would be nice if they threw in a little side. I ate the sandwich in three bites. The bisque was barely lukewarm and not much flavor.

And C) the service I've received from cousins Maine Pittsburgh has led me to want to have a Maine lobster truck of my own someday. I strongly support Cousins Maine Lobster. If your lucky enough to come across a Cousins Maine Lobster truck someday, I suggest having the Lobster grilled cheese will the lobster bisque on the side, only if you've already had the lobster roll. I'd like to believe that all Cousins Maine lobster trucks are created equal, however that can't be True. Because I know that the one in Pittsburgh cannot be topped. This may seem like opinion, however, it is not. And I say this for one reason. To have you come to Pittsburgh and try cousins Maine lobster Pittsburgh. Because once you do, you will understand that my review is in fact, Fact.",

    "text": "Wow, wow, wow. I had heard about this truck and was so excited to finally be at an event where it. It was at the 2018 Greater Pittsburgh Food Truck festival at the Meadows Casino. The festival started at noon, we showed up at 12:10 And the line for Cousins was already very long!. Note to self, this truck is more popular than I was led to believe, show up early! After a 40+ minute wait in the hot sun I made my way to the window. They had tv's on the truck with the menu items and prices, but honestly they were very hard to see because of the sun. They also had printed photos of their items and it would have been a much better idea for them to have the prices listed on those pictures for people to see. It would also speed up the line because I could see people were taking forever to order. I was smart enough to examine the menu on my phone whole I was in line so I didn't have an issue. Another note is that they take cash or credit which is nice because their items are not cheap, $15/roll. I went with the Maine Lobster roll, their cold lobster roll version. They also have a Connecticut Roll which is served hot, lobster tots and tacos. I was so very surprised when I saw the roll, I had been anticipating this moment for quite awhile! Large, and I mean very large, hunks and claws of lobster. I loved the fact that is had his the absolute bare minimum amount of mayo and there was a little wedge of lemon to squeeze over the succulent lobster. So fresh and delicious. I was almost sad I didn't order two! Forgive my skepticism thinking that a Food truck in PA would have a good lobster roll!  I will most definitely be back for another when I see this truck at a future event. Loved it!",

Quesadillas with cheese are very inexpensive to make. You should at least see some bulk between the slices to warrant the price for the lobster, yet it is flat as it really just has cheese in it. I don't mind paying for good food but there is nothing to rave about here. Such a disappointment as it's a unique food truck. At the end of the day it's either butter bread with minimal lobster, or a quesadilla with cheese and not enough to taste.",

    "text": "Food Truck day at Work!  I chose Cousin's Maine Lobster cause quite frankly, there aren't many places in Pittsburgh that have a Lobster Roll and its been a while since I had one.  The wait was extremely long, and slow.  Only three people working in the truck, but lets be honest, you can't fit that many people into a food truck, so I was not surprised or discouraged by the wait time.  I didn't wait as long as a lot of other people that showed up later than I did.  I've read a few other reviews here on Yelp and there is a consistent trend, the prices.  Yes,...paying $12 for a grilled cheese sandwich is absurd, but how many grilled cheese sandwiches have lobster in them?  You are paying for what you get, and that is a premium meat that costs more than a lot of other things, so you shouldn't have too much sticker shock going in when you realize the reality that Lobster is expensive.  I went with the Maine Lobster Roll and also ordered some Lobster Tater Tots which I shared.  The Roll bun was great, perfectly toasted and crunchy.  I did order extra lobster meat and it was falling out of the bun.  My only small critic would be for more mayo on the roll (but I generally like more mayo on things than most other people do I think) and I did come across two small shells in my roll,...not a big deal but you know, would rather have no shells in there. ;)  Lobster Tots were AMAZING!  Great tots and good Pico de Gallo salsa on top!  Big hunks of lobster claw meat,...this was by far my favorite of everything.  I'd like to try the Lobster Grilled Cheese and maybe the tacos some day.  I did find the link to Pittsburgh Food Park and will look out for Cousin's to be there some day.",

    "text": "Wow am I on the fence about this one. Was the lobster roll fresh, meaty and delicious? It most certainly was. If you are looking for big chunks of lobster this will be your roll. If you are someone who prefers more of a lobster dip type consistency (wholey's), meaning a whole lot of mayo and smaller pieces of lobster, you will not enjoy this.   I ordered a side of tots which was a no brainer. Tot life over everything! These tots were pretty unsatisfying. They had no flavor and were pretty soggy. I'm not sure if this was due to the fact that I didn't eat them at that very moment or if they didn't cook them enough. I had a 10 minute drive back to the office before I could chow down. For $22 I wish the roll was a little bigger to hold the meaty lobster claws. I felt like it was gone in no time, which is a good thing because that means I really liked it.   I ended up choosing the Connecticut roll which is served warm with butter and lemon. I would definitely try the Maine roll which is served cold with mayo. Initially I was going to order the lobster tots, but I am happy I decided to go for the roll instead.",

We had studied their menu online beforehand so we could game plan what we would order and share.   We ordered one cold served Maine style lobster roll, one warm served Connecticut style lobster roll and their lobster tater tots. On the way down, we stopped at a Get Go for some Iron City Light beers to accompany lunch because you need some \"bee-ah\" for your \"lobstah\" rolls. I wish they had forks for their lobster tater tots because it was pretty impossible to eat without one with all that was going on, but I managed.   The lobster truck delivered epic Maine lobster goodness. Can't wait for my next trip.",

I went with my aunt on the grand opening in Pittsburgh. We waited 2 hours in line, but it was a nice day and the owner, Sabin, hung out and chatted with me for about 40 minutes and definitely helped pass the time.   I got the Maine lobster roll, lobster tots and clam chowder (thanks Sabin!) and all were so good! So good that I went back a few days later to another location to get more lobster.  This time, in addition to the Maine roll and chowder, I got a lobster grilled cheese. One word: YUM!!  It is expensive, but that's the cost for delicious and fresh seafood. It reminds me of home so I'll continue to go and support this business and the owners really care about their customers and food.",

When I found out that there was a lobster food truck in my area, I stalked them until they came to my area.  I gathered family and friends and placed a huge order (5 Connecticut, 1 Maine, and one grilled cheese lobster sandwich.)  We got home and tore into the bag.  Were we ever DISAPPOINTED!!!!  The rolls were small and BLAND! We couldn't tell the difference between the Connecticut and the Maine rolls if it weren't for the temperature difference.  There wasn't even the faintest hint of butter on any of the rolls.  The grilled cheese has pepper jack cheese which completely overpowers the lobster.  So after everyone ate, we took a vote and all seven said we would not be interested in eating from their food truck again.  The taste was just not there.",

    "text": "\"I know you can be underwhelmed, and you can be overwhelmed, but can you ever just be, like, whelmed?\" This is exactly how I feel about this food truck. There is so much hype surrounding it, lines are crazy long and sometimes they run out of food. My husband and I were amped to try it when it came to a food truck rally \"near\" our house.  I got a Connecticut roll and he got the lobster grilled cheese and tots... $40 later we got our food.  Mine was supposed to be warm it was as if someone held the lobster in their hand for a few mins and then put it on the roll, there was supposed to be lemon and mayo. It was all in the first bite... nothing after that. My husband said there was one discernible piece of lobster and the rest was just a grilled cheese sandwich. The tots were just tots nothing exciting-not even seasoning.  I guess we can say we've tried it. But I can assure you we won't be back.  $40 and we were still hungry not worth the hype.",

But I think you can get a lobster roll down at Rolland's for a better price and larger portion. I mean since they've been endorsed by shark tank and other investors, etc. there are a lot of good reviews and it already has a name for itself. I'll probably try the quesadilla if I get to the truck again, but I'm not going to break my neck to find the truck again. I'm not convinced it's the best in pgh.",

The wow factor occurred when given the choice between having the lobster roll served warm or cold .  I chose cold, Maine-style.  Portion was generous,  I did take advantage of adding more lobster meat for an additional $4 , but it lacked any kind of flavor.  The mayo was a small dot on the buttered grilled bun.    Doubtful if I order the lobster roll again, but I might try another item on the menu if I find myself passing by this food truck another time.",

My fiancee couldn't understand why I would even consider paying over $20 for food truck sandwiches, but soon she would comprehend my excitement.   I had heard and seen pictures of the famous lobster rolls and lobster grilled cheese for months and I was in disbelief that I was finally about to experience this wonderful feeling. The saying better late than never, couldn't be more True when it comes to how long I waited to try Cousins Maine Lobster. The huge, hunks of fresh coldwater lobster were present in every bite! My fiancee proclaimed it was easily the best grilled cheese she'd ever had in life, and I know for a fact that the lobster roll was the best I'd ever tasted.  Cousins Maine Lobster has a reputation and a name that precedes itself for good reason. I can't describe the warm, happy feeling I got seeing this truck and finally having the chance to eat their lobster. I pinky-promise you don't want to miss out, find out where they'll be and go!",

I ordered one Maine Lobster Roll and one Connecticut Lobster Roll but when we sat down to eat they were both the same which was OK because it was good but just too bad they could`t get the order right especially when you are paying $15.75 each. They also Have Lobster gilled cheese, Tarter tots, Lobster Taco`s and the two Lobster Rolls Maine or Connecticut, and a Whoopie pie for dessert. They have Napkins foil bags hot sauce outside the ordering window but no silverware. There is a computer screen on the outside that you can see when they ring you up.  Pros: Lobster Rolls are DELICIOUS   Cons: They were an hour late to event staff is not friendly and did`t get my order correct.  After arriving late to event the line was a half of block long and still did not open for another half and hour, so that is why I only give them 4 stars. I will try them again in the future and hope the customer service is better and they are on time and can get the order correct!",

When I saw the long line I was annoyed because I thought, all these people were getting in the way of me and my lobster !  After a 35 minute wait, it was my turn to order.  We ordered a Connecticut roll, 2 lobster tail and tots, and a kids grilled cheese.  The lobster  roll was to die for.  The tail and tots were also good, had a little kick to them, but the salty balanced nicely with the meal.  I am so glad I finally got to try this place.   On another note some are complaining about the price but lobster ain't cheap, so $15 for a lobster is pretty standard fare.    Eat up, butter cup!",

I got the lobster tots and I about passed out in the parking lot where the truck was parked. I don't think I have ever thought bout how well beautifully buttered lobster and tater tots could go together. They should get married.

For $26 I had the Maine lobster roll, tots and a root beer  The roll was on what looked and felt like a hot dog bun only mildly toasted. The lobster was like warm and had no lemon or butter taste at all. Extremely BLAND.  How can the signature menu item be so lackluster? I could have steamed a lobster at home and tasted better.  The tots were $5 , and in my guess frozen tots.  I have had much better lobster (Roland's in the strip) AND much better food trucks.  I have never been so disappointed after spending so much money especially when there is so much hype.  Thankful I didn't travel far or take my family If you are like me and have been wanting to try this truck you probably will, but will probably be disappointed",

Lobster was fresh and plentiful in the rolls.  The lobster tacos were mostly onion.  Service was not wonderful - the server did not apologize for dropping half an order of (cold) tater tots on my mom's head and was rude when we asked for the soup missing from our order. I know it's only their second or third week - so hopefully things can be improved.  For $68 for 3 meals they will need to step it up.  Revised Opinion - Many months ago Cousins was new to Pgh and I was disappointed.  That was not the case today!  If the crowd was any indication of the following the truck has gained around the city....I was hoping for the best and I was not disappointed.  Service was excellent and the food was great!!",

I think that's the best deal for your dollars. The shrimp tacos were a bit of a disappointment. Since this is a seafood-based food truck, I was expecting regular sized shrimp. These were the super tiny shrimp, like the size of the shrimp you get if you buy the Chicken of the Sea shrimp in a can.   Definitely on the pricier side.

I got a lobster roll and lobster tacos.  The bill came to $31.  It was so small that it didnt come close to feeding us.  It was good, just really small.",

    "text": "I've had my eye on this food truck for quite some time now so when I learned it was going to be at the greater Pittsburgh food truck festival at the Meadows my husband and I headed down there.  We arrived almost 30 minutes before the festival opened and there was already a line about half a block long for this truck alone! Not counting the time we waited for the festival to open we waited approx another 25 minutes until we made it to the front window to order.  I decided to order the Connecticut hot lobster roll and my husband ordered the Maine cold lobster roll. For $15.75 a piece they each come on a New England style roll. Condiments and napkins are right outside so I would suggest that you get them before you order. They have no silverware. Gluten free options are available.  We got our food fairly fast-team is very efficient! We were able to take our food inside the lobby of the Meadows to sit down and eat it.  Mine was partially heated but tasty. It had the buttery taste to it and there were large chunks of meat. I would assume it was the butter that cooled it off.  It was a bit messy so I'm glad we took a bunch of napkins before we ordered.  I sampled my husband's Maine lobster with the lemon wedge and I found it chunky and fresh! It does comes chilled and had a touch of mayo on it. It is cooked lobster but served cold. He really enjoyed it. Both rolls included lobster claws.  This food truck is pricey but that's what I would expect to pay for lobster. It's not cheap. We decided to forgo the side of tots and whoopie pie since we wanted to get dessert elsewhere. When we returned I saw that the line had tripled!!!   I like the fact that they will show you your order on a computer screen to confirm accuracy. Most people pay with cards because this place alone really adds up.  Not too often one finds real Maine lobster and it is a luxury dish. They have a few restaurants in other cities and we are one of the few cities to have their food trucks.  If you wish to try them out then they have a website which gives their schedule one week at a time. My suggestion is definitely to get here as early as possible because you may end up waiting over an hour to get to the front of the line. This appears to be one of most popular food trucks in the Pittsburgh area.",

Looking at the menu I thought ok this is a little pricey but it everyone says it's amazing then it's worth it. I ended up ordering the Connecticut roll. I was sadly pretty disappointed with it. Seemed like it had little to no flavor. Just tasted like lobster between 2 slices of bread. Would be nice to have a little sauce or extra flavor of some kind. My coworkers told me the cold roll was much better so I would be willing to give it a second chance.",

    "text": "Huge giant chunks of lobster?  Yes please!  My trusty sidekick and I obviously had to try both types of lobster rolls (Connecticut- served warm w/butter and lemon or Maine- served chilled w/a touch of mayo) to see which one we preferred.  While both were loaded with huge lobster pieces and both were good the Connecticut was the winner in my book.  It was a little pricey for food truck food but honestly it was loaded with so much lobster goodness I gladly forked over my money.    I will continue to stalk where the food truck will be so I can indulge in this deluxe treat.  So glad they're in Pittsburgh now so we can have authentic and delicious lobster rolls - my latest obsession.",

    "text": "I really can't say I agree at all with the 4.5 star rating, unfortunately.   I was very excited when Cousins Maine Lobster came to the office I work at, and the large line in front of the truck seemed to indicate I wouldn't be disappointed.  The truck is adorned with various media placards, such as \"Shark Tank\" and pictures with Gordon Ramsay. The menu is a flat screen television built into the side of the truck with a flap that swings up in order to shield it from the sun and make it more visible. After ordering, a touch screen is in front of you, again on the side of the truck, allowing you to tip and request a receipt by email. And you also get a pager for your order.  But all of this bling must be the reason that the food is, in my opinion, extremely overpriced. I ordered a lobster grilled cheese ($14) as a combo with tater tots and a drink (+$5) while leaving a 15% tip, which is the minimum tip suggestion on the touch screen. After tax, my total came out to $23.18.  The grilled cheese consisted of two standard sized, Texas style slices of toast, the sort you would find in a grocery store -- not oversized, like you would find in many restaurants -- with two slices of cheese, one cheddar, and I believe the other was pepper jack, and then pieces of lobster on top.  The grilled cheese by itself can't be more than something you'd pay $5 for by itself. There was definitely not $9 of lobster included on it. The can of soda was likewise not worth more than $1 after markup, and the tater tots certainly not $4.  The food was OK, but not anything special. After feeling so let down by the overcharge, I researched the franchise, and found that buying in to a truck costs a minimum of $160,000 to $360,000. Because of this, I don't blame the owners of the franchise at all for the price they're asking, but I do feel the customer is paying in excess to recoup the cost to run one of their trucks.  I just can't recommend it at all, unless you're a big lobster fan, and don't mind being overcharged.",
