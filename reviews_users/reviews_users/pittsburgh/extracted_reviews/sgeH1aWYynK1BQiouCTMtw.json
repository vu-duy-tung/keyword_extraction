    "text": "J & J Family Restaurant and & Caterer has the longest name ever when it simply is a diner. That being said, the food is good if you like that type of food which fortunately I do.  If you're looking for atmosphere don't go in. When you go in you'll see white walls, old furniture and elderly people gawking at you because you don't have the newspaper under your armpit. It is what it is there. The service is usually decent but they don't take debit card which to me is always a minus. Get with the times. It's okay to have a limit but at least have it available. The price point is typical for dines in this region.  This place is ideal for anyone who is hungover, easily impressed and/or just hungry for some good breakfast. If you want class you should stay at home.",

    "text": "Whoa. The Big Country breakfast is no joke. It's a lot of food to consume but it's all pretty good. Typical breakfast/diner type of food but it certainly hit the spot. The coffee was great as well. There isn't too much seating inside but it wasn't too busy when we went with a small group for a late breakfast just before noon on a Sunday, and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. My friends who live in Mt. Washington come here often and my first time there with them did not disappoint. It seems and feels like a great neighborhood diner and I can understand why people frequent the place quite often. Contrary to some of the reviews on J&J's, they do accept cards now.",

    "text": "This is your classic family owned diner (but i cant say that is technical, i mean that as the style of the place). The staff is friendly, and its classic atmosphere. I cant give them an awesome review because i have only been there three time. This last visit prompted me to write (the other two visits were lunch with contractors from a project near by, amd we drank pop). This time with my wife, we had coffee. Its ironic they have a rustic wall sign saying \"best coffee.\" She and had a good laugh about this for the hour we were there. We tipped well, fyi, but i had to force myself to keep a straight face everytime they asked if we wanted more coffee. You mean ice tea, right? Batch after batch, decaf or regular.. we saw pots of tea churn out.. and not even a dark rich tea... but really weak coffee. I put more beans in a little french press for two! They REALLY need to fix their coffee. Saving the scoup of coffee every batch is NOT cool. And on a side note, my wifes bacon was delicious and crispy.. i had the bacon stuffed pancakes... and literally I am part of the clean plate club, but i ended up leaving bits and peices. Sooo rare. Why? Because there were chunks of chewey or squishy lard. I guess they put the good bacon on the plates... and the sub-stsndard bacon goes in the pancakes. That is not hidden... we still have to eat it. For $3 for bacon... you can make sure its a good experience please? Otherwise.. great place... classic diner. I am sure the food might have been a one time thing, but the coffee? Clearly poor management choices to save a few pennies. FIX please",

We had been looking forward to trying this place for a while. When we arrived, we were thrown onto a 6-person table with 2 random strangers, whose chairs blocked the way to the inside chairs my husband and I were supposed to sit in in the corner. We asked for water and drinks...it took forever to get our water and our drinks were gross. The restaurant didn't feel clean at all, and our waitress wasn't super friendly. We ordered food, and I remember not being able to find anything on the menu I was really crazy about, and it was pretty gross as far as taste is concerned. I didn't end up finishing half my food. It took forever to get our check, and our day just started off really bad because of this. I'm willing to give it another shot, but I probably won't because the Micro Diner is consistently amazing so why mess with what's good.",

Good, fast, friendly service.  Food quality is everything I want for breakfast - the meats are top quality; thick cut bacon, bulk savory sausage, thick ham steaks.  And God bless them, real salted butter on everything - nothing tastes quite like it.  With all of that being said, don't walk in the door expecting anything other than an urban neighborhood diner.  I starting eating here just out of convenience when I lived on Mt Washington but I still find myself making the trip back because I just can't find anything that compares anywhere else.",

We went this morning and the menu has changed since our last visit, the steak salad is no longer on the menu (which is what I went there for) but they told me they could make it for me anyway. They came back and said they didn't have any hard boiled eggs (how does a breakfast place not have hard boiled eggs?) So I opted for sausage gravy and biscuits. They came out and I kid you not, the biscuits were refrigerator cold and the gravy was tepid at best, but to add insult to injury they are no longer homemade biscuits but Pillsbury southern home style instant biscuits. The kind that pop out of the exploding can and had the yellow food coloring grease dots inside that are supposed to be butter tastin'. They took them back and brought me fresh ones and fresh gravy but either they took the new biscuits out of the oven too soon or they just nuked them because there was no hint of crust or firmness to the biscuits they were just warm and soft, it was like eating gravy over a hamburger bun. I asked if they had been bought or were under new management and I got a very quick and curt \"no\". So sadly J & J is off the future weekend list.",

    "text": "Come for the breakfast ... only get the breakfast.  I came for the breakfast.  I was in the area about three years ago and many of the smaller Mom and Pop diners that I actually liked had closed.  Thankfully this place was still open and I was hungry.  Located near the top of Mount Washington, this little diner benefits by its proximity to the Mount Washington Parking garage.  Rather stark inside, the locals and owners like to dress up the interior and exterior for the holidays.  While we were looked at suspiciously at first, we were accepted into the fold when we placed our order:  Chicken and rice soup Ham and cheese with homefries Big Country Breakfast: eggs (poached medium), bacon (soft), and blueberry pancakes with toast and homefries  The chicken and rice soup had very little chicken and A LOT of vegetables and the broth was rather flavorless.  I would like to take this time to rename it to Vegetable and Rice soup -- now if only it had some flavor.  As we muddled through the soup, our entrees came to the table.  Did I mention I was hungry?  The Big Country Breakfast looked great.  I went straight for the blueberry pancakes and enjoyed their flavor.  They were good and fluffy and the blueberries had good flavor that just popped in my mouth.  After eating about a quarter of them I moved on to the  eggs.  They were cooked perfectly -- egg whites fully solid and the yolk slightly viscous in the center.  I love eggs when they are cooked perfectly like this since a majority of the yolk will adhere to the whites and then I can come in with my toast and mop up the rest.  OH SO GOOD! And back to the pancakes....then the eggs...and then the bacon.  They listened to me and brought out my bacon soft.  I swear that I am the only person in the world that dislikes crunchy bacon.  I looked over at the omelet but decided not to try it.  It had been browned.  I know it is a psychological thing, but if my eggs are browned I will not touch them.  I will accept my friends comments that it was good.  He finished it and appeared to enjoy it.  The only other down point about the meal were the homefries -- not a lot of flavor to them at all.  I decided to just leave them at the side and eat the rest of my meal.  I enjoyed this experience and will return from time to time.  Even though there is the garage, it can be hectic to find a parking space.  I think that the only reason I would choose this diner over O'Leary's is the pancakes.  They were so much better.  That is fine, though, I go to O'Leary's for the French Toast.",

First of all, I love American diner places,there's something about diner food that just makes me feel at home (missing my motherland). So my husband ordered the Egg Benedict with the side of fries and i only ordered 3 piece french toast with no sides..(i was trying to eat less because we r trying to hit buffet for lunch)..the french toast was good and it was a decent 3 piece,i also asked if they can put whipped cream on top which they did. Just a tip,if you order french toast,make sure you get something a lil salty on the side like a bacon or sausage. Overall experience was good,food  was good and I will come back again.",

I will start off by saying that our server today was not very attentive.  There's only about ten tables in the whole restaurant, so I know she couldn't have been too overwhelmed.  I ordered the works, which comes with ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes.  I also ordered their new cold brew coffee with a shot of caramel syrup.  I very much enjoyed the cold brew. Each visit, I have been disappointed by the blandness of the potatoes.  I had to cover them in salt and ketchup in order to fully enjoy them.  The Italian toast was very good, and the meats and eggs were definitely satisfactory.  My wife and sister in law both got the cinnamon roll pancakes, which are AMAZING.  They require no syrup as it comes with some sort of cinnamon icing.  I would definitely come back to J&J's, but I would only order specific items.  It seems to be rather hit or miss.  I would have to go with Micro Diner as my first choice based on overall quality of meats/potatoes, but the cinnamon roll pancakes at J&J's most certainly win best sweet breakfast award, and will keep me coming back.",

That is what makes it alright that the service isn't your typical career servers. They are mum and pop serving your food. So if they drop your food or spill, you get a \"woops hun, sorry baat that\" Again, the reason I enjoy the place.  The food is well priced and filling but lacks anything overly special. I had their loaded pancakes which were confusing but I liked them nonetheless. I hate giving mom and pop shops much less than this but i wasn't in love. Welcoming, Cozy, old fashioned and filling.

The food is always served piping hot & the service is excellent, on par with the high-priced restaurants on the mountain with the views. Eat here and enjoy the views for free. You won't leave here disappointed!",

If you are expecting a high brow affair, go somewhere else. But the breakfast was great. I had the 'loaded pancakes', pancakes mixed with chunks of bacon and sausage with two fried eggs in the middle. How can you go wrong with that! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and, while I didn't get one, they have bacon milkshakes! Mmm...next time....  Oh yeah! CASH ONLY!!!",

I'm originally from Kentucky and I'm certain my mother would be happy with the food here.   It's a smaller establishment, but that adds to the at-home atmosphere. The cinnamon roll pancakes are amazing with 3 huge pancakes topped with cinnamon and frosting.  The cinnamon raisin French toast is delectable and my daughter, who doesn't normally like FT, devoured these. The meat lovers omelette is stuffed with chopped sausage, pieces of thick cut bacon, and diced ham. On the whole, you really get the feeling that everything that comes out the back has been made by hand and with love. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!",

I swear we received the friendliest service possible. The decor is outdated, the food was decently good, but if we ever back, it'd definitely be for the service. I swear, the waitress has the smile and positive attitude that would make anybody fall in love with her.  There were some interesting items on the menu that tug at curious minds. Bacon milkshake? Hmm.. bacon is always good, but as a milkshake? Should I try it? Maybe not this time around haha. One of my friends said the loaded pancakes sounded like a terrible idea (on his stomach) but you know, they don't offer such a treat many other places. He went with it with no regrets afterward. Everything else was pretty good -- I'd recommend the 2, 2 & 2 for a bit of variety and The Works for a hearty, meaty breakfast. Don't forget to read down the center of the menu, for their special combos.  The coffee is great, but order it before you order your food. It's piping hot and stays hot for quite a while. It was the perfect temperature by the time our food arrived.  I wanted to trick everybody by paying for the entire bill when no one was looking, but the waitress informed me that it was cash only. Fail. D:",

I ordered the Brunchadilla ($10.99) for breakfast, and my friend and I split a side of grits.  The brunchadilla was massive and loaded with eggs, bacon, peppers, and possibly some things I am forgetting.  It was a nice combination of things, and I enjoyed my meal.  I don't eat potatoes so my friend ate some of those and said they were average.  The grits were not good and went mostly untouched.  My friend did enjoy her meal minus the grits, though.  I would stick to the meals and skip the sides if I returned.",

It was early afternoon so he ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and his one friend ordered a burger while the other three ordered breakfast. From the time we got there until we left it was well over an hour. Breakfast food does not take long to cook. One table that had been there before we got there got their food an hour after we were seated. To make this even better I have attached a picture of the buffalo chicken wrap. No one else complained about their food but I will say that the biscuits were clearly from a container. I also noticed one of the cooks was wheeling around on a computer chair to cook. To top everything off my boyfriend became very ill not long after eating which is a big sign of food poisoning. He said the chicken tasted weird but figured it was just because it was COLD.  Sadly this review doesn't even touch on the slow service from wait staff. It was pretty busy but it shouldn't take as long as it did to get waited on or have our drinks brought to us.",

I also love the stuffing bread that comes with the hot turkey. If you have a large group though, this place is not for you. Seating is limited as they only have maybe 12 tables.

I went once on Black Friday after a long work week that included working Thanksgiving. I felt overwhelmingly grateful to the staff for being so gracious and giving me a slice of home.  The food is the epitome of \"down-home cooking\"; not fussy or elaborate, just honest-to-goodness food made by genuine people, and generous portions of it.  I usually get a Spinach, Tomato & Mozz Omelette, or the delightful Monte Cristo Sandwich. Their specials, however, are not to be ignored. I've seen them range from Banana Split  Pancakes to Pumpkin French Toast, and that's only breakfast.  Plus, they have an impressive array of milkshake options, and are up to concocting any type you can imagine!",

    "text": "I have lived less than a block from this place for 2 years and never tried it. My husband finally went today for breakfast. I will admit I was hesitant. I love Micro Diner and couldn't imagine anything else being better.   I ordered a breakfast that came with cinnamon roll pancakes, eggs, toast, and potatoes. The cinnamon rolls were delicious - super fluffy, and the icing on them was awesome. They were huge! Easily a whole breakfast on their own. The eggs and bread were great. The potatoes were fresh, but a little lacking in taste. I think they would have been good with cheese or something else to add flavor.   The service here was incredible, and ultimately earned this review an additional star. Especially in comparison to some other eateries up on Mount Washington. I also love the atmosphere inside. Feels like you go back in time, or escape to a small town where everyone knows everyone. I will definitely return and add this to my list of local favorites!",

    "text": "Three words: Cinnamon Roll Pancakes!!!   Went here for a late breakfast on Saturday and I loved it!  Very cute diner with a homey atmosphere. I ordered cinnamon roll pancakes..... My taste buds did a happy dance while I savored them!  I couldn't finish them, but oh how I wish I could have!!   Prices are more than reasonable. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I will go back time and time again, hopefully to try more of the menu, but i cant promise I won't go back to those cakes again.",

    "text": "Yummy food, large portions, reasonable prices, friendly service! I was visiting Pittsburgh with family and we wanted to have breakfast before taking in the views from Mt. Washington. This was the perfect spot. My avocado toast with poached eggs, asiago cheese, and tomato salad was delicious. The bread is thick and crusty. Poached eggs were perfect. Everyone loved their meals which ran the gammut from pancakes to bacon, ham, sausage, potatoes. The potatoes were real and hand cut, notfrom a bag.  Thanks J and J!",

    "text": "J & Js is a small local diner at the top of mt Washington. The waitresses were friendly and the prices were reasonable. I ordered the Greek omelet which was good, just a bit on the small side. It looked more like two eggs rather than three. But at least it had flavor. They were pretty busy when we walked in, but our coffee cups were never empty. Not sure which is better, micro diner or J&J's. But I'd patronize them both again.",
