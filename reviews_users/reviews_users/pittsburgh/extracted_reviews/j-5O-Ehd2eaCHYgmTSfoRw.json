Plus, I used to eat this all the time on my \"student budget\" when I lived at UCLA, so I'm really, really happy that they have one in downtown Pittsburgh...feels like home. Also, I love that you can order online and just pick it up in 10 minutes to skip those long lines. Secret revealed!!!! Okay, not a secret, just a tip. But, even if you're in those long lines, it moves pretty fast.",

We needed food to help soak up our free cocktails, and we needed it now!  What better way then with a yummy burrito?  Service was fast and friendly, and we got our burritos to go so that we could sit in Market Square and people-watch.  We listened to the music coming out of NOLA, and nommed our burrito snacks.  I always enjoy Chipotle, sometimes even craving it, and I like how they aim to serve sustainably raised ingredients.  It's always super satisfying and tasty, and you get exactly what you are hoping for.  And this one is in a great location, perfect for sitting outside and relaxing.",

Music is blasting to the point where you can't think. The food is good enough that its bearable going there, but too many times have stupid technicalities caused incredible frustration.

Have you read the disclaimer that due to how they source their food (local, fresh, natural, etc.) tastes can differ from geographic region?! Well let me tell you - this is True!   A Chipotle in NYC is what got me initially hooked to this chain and then living in Chicago with a Chipotle around the block from where I worked solidified its status as a top 5 eating place preference for me. So you can imagine my enthusiasm when I had heard Chipotle was coming downtown (I work downtown). My coworkers didn't have to imagine my enthusiasm they heard about it until I finally got myself down to Chips and had a go.   I came back sorta like Charlie Brown on a rainy day - head hung low, sad music in the background. I struggled to tell my coworkers that something was just off and the Chips in downtown wasn't all I had hoped.   I still encouraged them to go, but with a caveat that there are better Chipotles out there and if they go to another city to check them out. While I've gone to this Chipotle a handful of times, I can't help but feel nostalgic about the memories of a 5 star Chipotle.",

And hey, I'll give credit where credit is due, and this is not an easy location to work at. This Chipotle is smack in the middle of a hubspot of downtown activity. It always has a line, and they have to do their best with the space, hands and time they're given. So seriously, good on them - they at least seemed to have a handle on keeping their line of patrons moving when I stopped in.  What they clearly don't have a handle on, though, are online orders. I had ordered my dinner via the Chipotle app specifically because I knew I would have about 20 minutes to get where I needed to go that night downtown after parking. So I put in a pickup time for 7:45 so I could eat as I strolled on over to my next appointment. Unfortunately, even though Chipotle promises that ordering through an app will guarantee your food is ready to go when you arrive, the staff ruined my plan, and didn't even start to make my order until I arrived. As a result I basically ended up in the back of the line, and I had to eat as I half jogged on down to my next stop that night; it was either that or not get dinner until 11pm.  After that, I'm definitely going to avoid this location if I can. Their food may be worth a 5 star rating but that type of failure to meet company standards is a definitive 1 in my book - my 3 star rating is basically a balance of this. I certainly appreciate why they're always busy. That's not the problem. My problem was that they completely ignored my order until I arrived, the exact opposite of what app users are promised. If they're too busy to make app orders on time, they should look into being removed from the online ordering system. In the meantime, I'd rather spend the time and money necessary to avoid that kind of service during a rushed lunch or dinner.",

In fact, I once stopped in halfway through a pretty soul-crushing afternoon. My attitude must have been obvious because the manager comped my meal just in hopes that it would help cheer me up. It really did!",

I was second in line, when the person dishing the food started complaining to the guest in front of me about his job. I get it, we all have rough days so I wait a while until they finish their conversation & it's finally my turn. The man comes back and starts a to-go order and totally ignores me. Finally, it's my turn. I typically get brown rice but they were about out so I had to get white. The rice and chips had no flavor. The place in general was dirty and my belly is still rumbling.

Anyway, I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend and there was a Chipotle in Market Square that I hadn't tried yet, so I figured I'd go there for lunch.   First thing I noticed is the food line was long and slow-moving. This is not a problem unique to Chipotle though. It happens at Qdoba and Moe's as well. The bottleneck is when each customer has to pick the toppings they want. I ordered the burrito bowl with sofritas. This probably depends on the person scooping the rice and ingredients, but in what I got, the portion size was disappointingly small for the price. The dining area is small and cramped for the crowd. Even when I was seated, I had people bump into me a bunch of times, which was annoying. That's probably a result of limited space in a city location.   And finally, restroom access requires a key code, which can be found on your receipt, so I hope you saved it.",

He basically said \"...and?

I don't know what happened to the previous team but the servers at the front don't seem to know what they're doing. Lots of standing around and not offering an explanation for the delay. No \"sorry, we're waiting on veggies/brown rice/chicken/etc.\" This causes aggravating and excessively long lines during lunch hour (even for chipotle).  The two stars are really just for the nice cashier and the taste of the food. I don't plan on going back to this location unless there's an obvious change in management and cleanliness.",

I just recently started working in downtown and have been trying out a lot of new lunch places. A lot of my friends are Chipotle fans, but I had only been several times throughout the country and never quite understood their love for it.  Except that changed yesterday. I'm not sure what lured me into Chipotle, but something did.   The environment is very attractive and trendy with lots of seats lining the windows overlooking Forbes and Market Square. It makes for a great zone-out, people-watching lunch that is often needed mid-day when you work in an office with no windows.  The prices are inexpensive, and the quality of food is exceptional. Why have I been going to Qdoba and Moe's all these years? I just wanted to kick myself for somehow overlooking how great Chipotle is all this time.  I highly recommend the Burrito Bowl, the featured item when I went yesterday. Very tasty and filled with fresh ingredients. Plus, I didn't feel like it was very bad for me with its mix of chicken, rice, and toppings. OK, now I might just be deceiving myself, but just go with it for me!!  If you didn't guess already based on my review... I'll be back!",

I asked for salsa after I saw the receipt and one employee told me \"he couldn't do that\" in an exasperated tone. To his defense, he was handling meat but I had already asked the other two employees who were actively ignoring me. Also, the chips tasted like an entire bottle of salt had accidentally been poured out on them.

Well, against my better judgement, I tried again using the website for delivery. I ordered two burritos, two drinks. The order was late, and when the delivery man handed the bag to my husband, the bag fell apart. He then realized that there was a bowl inside the bag instead of two burritos, and showed the delivery man that the order was missing a drink and was wrong according to the receipt. The delivery man insisted that it had to be correct and that he couldn't do anything about it. No refund. No offer to correct the order. Nothing.

    "text": "It's Chipotle, so how can I not give it 5 stars? As my fellow Yelpers have mentioned, this place gets as packed as a can of sardines during lunch time. Everybody's trying to get a little piece of the greatness. It may seem daunting waiting almost half an hour for food, but when you're staring down at that beautiful, juicy, voluptuous burrito, you'll know it was worth the sacrifice. The employees here are great and keep the line moving out of fear that we're all going to riot.   On a more serious note, if you have not signed up for their text alerts, you are a FOOL and depriving yourself of their fantastic BOGO deals!",

    "text": "There's always a long line here at lunch time and with good reason. The food is inexpensive (I paid $6.95 for a chicken burrito bowl), good quality and it's tasty. To the credit of the people behind the counter, the line moves very quickly. It seems like you're in store for an eternity of waiting when you first get in line, but before you know it you're picking between white or brown rice and black or pinto beans.   Sure it's a chain. Sure it's fast food. But it's a relatively healthy, low carb, low fat, high protein alternative to the greasy burger you'll get at other fast food establishments. It's no wonder there's always a long line at Chipolte.",

    "text": "Don't waste your time here, it's disgusting. I placed my order at 9:45 pm, the young man behind the counter didn't greet me or say anything, just a blank stare, weird. As I started eating my meal the manager began harassing me about taking my food in a bag because apparently they were closed. I told her it was not 10:00 o'clock yet, their hours are stated everywhere as closing at 10:00 pm, and not 9:45 pm. She said they were closed and I needed to leave (???). She was nasty and unprofessional, I called her up on it saying it's rude to kick people out while they're eating, suggested they change their closing hours to 9:45 pm instead to make people aware. The entire staff seemed way too thuggish, no manners, no customer service and to top it off a nasty manager threatening people to leave. The place was extremely dirty, every space filled with food and trash, including tables and floor. I asked her if I could use the bathroom, she said it's already been cleaned. Again, it's not 10:00 pm yet, shame on you. I was very professional to her and was simply pushing back at the harassment, when suddenly a friend of the manager that was there waiting for her approached her in a threatening manner asking her if he needed to take care of me. Whaaaa!? LOL #ThugLife  I ate my entire meal in about 5 minutes, and when I came out of the bathroom I said thank you to the cashier that was there while manager and her friends were still talking about me. I will never come here again.",

    "text": "I try to avoid this Chipotle location at all costs, but being the only Chipotle downtown, sometimes a strong Chipotle craving will come over me that forces me to stop in here, which I leave with regret every single time. I rarely have good experiences here. Compared to other Chipotle locations in Pittsburgh, this one is really stingy on the ingredients. The service is usually quite slow here too. Other locations seem to have the method down to a science but this one seems to always be training new employees or something to that effect. Since this is the only Chipotle in town, the lunch rush is insane; the line usually wraps around the entire store and extends back to their back door! Having a rather small dining room doesn't help accommodate the lunch rush either.   Ok - here are the real reasons why I cannot bring myself to come here. The chicken has been raw on one occasion. I mean, completely raw. Granted, we got a refund for our meals but raw chicken is unacceptable. On top of serving us raw chicken, when we notified the workers of our raw chicken, they did not replace the chicken they were serving but rather, continued to serve that batch of chicken to other diners. Not good. On another occasion, my burrito bowl was so incredibly over salted that it was inedible. I couldn't tell if it was the rice, the beans or what component that was over salted but like I said, it was like eating straight salt.  There are other locations that do it way better. Avoid this one if you can.",

And the employees are fun and upbeat!  One of my favorites is the chicken burrito or the steak bowl. But everything I have tried on the menu is a hit!   So the next time you venture to downtown Pittsburgh, stop in and enjoy some Mexican....I LOVE CHIPOTLE!",

    "text": "I love Chipotle as much as the next person, but this location has been disappointingly inconsistent. Don't get me wrong, there have been been many times where the food was superb; however, that is sadly not always the case. These inconsistencies include issues such as stale chips, over salted rice and beans, and smaller-than-average portion sizes.  Surprisingly, I've noticed that the quality of the food is usually best when they are busy. Also, if you visit this location anytime after 9PM, there is a 50% chance that they will be out of some of their ingredients.   My Chipotle obsession will not stop me from revisiting this location. Hopefully, I can update this review when I notice some more satisfactory consistency.",

They were out of lettuce and just wrapped my food up and didn't ask if I wanted to wait. Sorry to everyone else who went tonight and were treated the same way.",

We usually go to the Oakland one unless we're in the downtown area. My order is never right at this downtown location. Today, it was missing salsa and everything was just dry and lacked flavor. My boyfriend opened up his tacos and pulled a long black hair out of them. This is totally unacceptable. Save yourselves and go to the Oakland location. We have NEVER had a complaint there and the food is delicious.",
