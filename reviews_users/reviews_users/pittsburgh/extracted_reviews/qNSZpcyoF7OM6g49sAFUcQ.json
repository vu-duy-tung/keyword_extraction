The setup is appealing to my inner southern tendencies/roots (christmas light canopy/rustic cheque ). Ordered the pizza and was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong - I ate some of it- but factored in having had to skip lunch due to work obligations. I was at the point were stale bread would have tasted like truffle butter.  Service was very pleasant and attentive without being obnoxious (unlike the hipsters two deep...*sigh* to be young and blissfully ignorant)",

    "text": "Social is a good restaurant.   I would say the beer list is worthy of 4-stars (although sometimes they run out of the items on their menu).  I'm also a fan of the pierogi pizza and homemade ice cream sandwiches for dessert. And the salads are quite large so be forewarned.    Servers are also worthy of 4-stars, with timely and informed service, able to make good recommendations about food and beer. The server last night immediately brought drinks for the kids and had recommendations for us with the beer list.   The reason for the 3-star rating is the length of time its taken on a few occasions for the food to come out. With a family of 4, this can really be a problem when the kids start to get hungry.  For example, last night it took 20 minutes (possibly 25) for the food to come out. Which is just too long.",

Just know that of there is a major sporting event it will either start early or be canceled. The addition of a ping pong table and fooseball table on the porch are a fun touch. As for the food and drinks, the happy hour specials are excellent, though the food options change with the seasons. The food is pretty good but pretty standard. The tots are delicious thiugh, just make sure you ask for extra \"awesome sauce\"!",

The portion sizes are the size you would expect for a \"small plates\" dish and while the food was not bad, it was not good enough to command the price of tapas. My old fashioned was equally miniature. After we finished our food and first drinks, I was tempted to order another round of EVERYTHING (both food and drink) but decided that was quite socially acceptable since the dishes were not supposed to be small plates. We ended up just getting more drinks and leaving hungry.  Our waitress was overly nice, almost to the point of annoyance, but I guess that is better than the opposite. The patio is Social's one redeeming factor, but since it is almost winter I will have no reason to go back any time soon.",

You can get MUCH better honey mustard out of a squeeze container. We ordered the GCBLT...the bacon was inedible. It was totally burned and gave a bad flavor to the whole sandwich. The chicken was overcooked and dry. While all of the food was hot (appreciated), the tots were ice cold. This is supposed to be something special from them. The fruit salad had either been frozen or sat for many hours (or both). It was soft and slimy. On the plus side...the cauliflower patties were outstanding. The Cuban sandwich was good. The ham and cheese sandwich was acceptable. This will be the ABSOLUTE last time we make this MISTAKE!",

    "text": "Underwhelming, if you're coming for the food. If you're just here for drinks, I'm sure this is a much better place.  I came for lunch, and ordered the soup du jour and a side salad. Kind of hard to mess up, right? The salad was supposed to be a caesar salad, but had the barest essence of dressing, pretty much non existent cheese, and the lettuce was wilted. As in, floppy limp whythehellwouldyouservethis wilted. Whatever, it was a side salad, and I get it. Who cares about side salads. It's not like you're charging $4 for stuff you probably wouldn't feed your own kid. Oh, but there were a few giant croutons. Guess that's what made it a caesar salad. Maybe I was just disappointed because for a place that has a \"build your own salad\" option, I wouldn't have thought that a side salad would have been so disappointing.  The soup was \"baked potato\" soup, which was really just creamy potato with some bacon and sour cream. I'm not sure what I was expecting, come to think of it, so I'm not going to give them a hard time about this one, but it wasn't anything I would come back for.  My friend had the veggie burger, which came with a whole bunch of tater tots. Now, I haven't had tater tots since elementary school, so I actually give them props for appealing to my retro side. She said the burger was very good.   The service was fine, and it's got a nice informal atmosphere that I am sure makes it the perfect place for happy hour. But as a person who doesn't much drink... this place is not impressive at all.",

I wish that I could rave about all of the delightful menu items but I cant.  This shrimp salad has spinach, peas, orzo, feta cheese, and kale (my fav).  I always go with the lemon basil vinaigrette that the menu suggests because it is the BEST for this salad.  The lemon in the dressing gives the salad a nice kick to an otherwise mild mannered albeit delicious salad.  If you are a salad lover I suggest Social and the Grilled Shrimp Salad.  Hopefully I will break from my comfort zone and try other salads on the menu.  If I do, I will tell YELP first :)  note* The staff at Social have always been kind and attentive which is a HUGE Plus in my book!",

At first appearances the menu suggests interesting twists on standard pub fair, but don't be fooled.  I ordered the \"dewedged\" salad that claims pancetta as an ingredient.  What actually appeared on my plate was cold chewy bacon bits.  The consensus at the table was that the food fell far short of what was touted by the waitress as being made predominantly in-house.  There's a caveat to the $2 can Tuesday happy hour: It only applies to beers $4.50 and under.  Sadly, the beer selection is limited generally.  The beer selection priced at $4.50 and under forces you to choose from run-of-the-mill beers like Red Stripe, Blue Moon, and Yuengling.

    "text": "I had been wanting to go to this place for a while, and finally got to go last weekend. I remeber when they first opened they had some Google (it's located in Bakery Square right below Google) shin-dig and the food looked really good. It has an outside seating area but the when we were there it was raining so they covered the outdoor area with an awning thingy. I rather enjoyed the sound of the rain pelting the plastic awning, but, I'm a weirdo, so...  The menu is a lot of the norm- salads, sandwichs, pizzas- but with a kind of flare. For example, I got some sort of western salad with corn and black beans but it had mahi mahi on it. SO GOOD! The mahi mahi was delicious and cooked to perfection! Even was boyfriend who thinks everything is so-so declared it was fantastic!  And they have delicious, unique dressings like bacon bistro and chipotle lime. Very good! A lot of the sandwiches have unique, unusal ingredients that shake things up as well.   My BF and I ended up spliting a pizza and the salad. Like I said, the salad was amazing and the pizza was close behind. Because I picked the salad he picked the pizza and chose a buffalo chicken with blue cheese. Now, being a bread lover I always try the crust first. Having a good or bad crust strongly influences how I feel about a pizza. It was pretty good. Not too thin or thick with a nice wood fire oven taste even tough I don't  think it actually is cooked that way.   Now, like I said, it was buffalo chicken, which I like, but I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese and this cheese was, I was told, a strong, aged blue cheese. Way too strong for my weak palate. Other than that the pizza itself was good with a tasty buffalo sauce and lots of chicken.   Overall I really liked it. Food is definitley about average for a casual joint and the atmosphere is pretty cool too.",

Social has an option to create your own salad which my girlfriend and I both did.  We ended up being served the incorrect meal twice and on the third try, just sucked it up and ate it.  The waitress was extremely rude and as she served our food told us \"As I told you we're out of x, y and x\".  Actually, we had been informed that many other items we tried to order were unavailable (only to see them served to other customers and accidentally ourselves).  She then refused to return to our table.  We had to ask to speak to a manager 3 times before he was able to stop by our table, only to realize, he'd been working near us for the past 30 minutes.  He also could care less about the situation.  He was kind enough to offer a discount on the bill, but what we really wanted was an apology or assurance that this behavior is not acceptable.  All in all, it was OK food and horrible service.  Part of the dining experience and cost is service.  We won't be returning to pay to be treated poorly.",

My friends, it's the best turkey burger I've ever had!  But the thing is, it was good on all levels. The smoked gouda, lettuce, tomato and mango ketchup made it a dream. And let me tell you, I usually have to douse my burgers with condiments, but everything was the perfect amount. And the bun was awesome. I believe it was a potato bun, but whatever it was, it was a really good bun:)  I also ordered tots, which were good and crispy... but that burger just shined! Oh yeah, there was also some good ahi tuna nachos too. They were really good actually, but... you know what I'm gonna say... the burger was the best! But just so you know, the nachos are not necessarily nachos, but one singular chip with ahi tuna and gauc on top. They're a small portion, but a good starter.  I also like the fun atmosphere. It's really just all about being social. I like the wide open feel. So even though I was there for lunch, I'm definitely going back for a happy hour or late night with friends. Definitely a very strong start for this new joint!",

    "text": "Finally made it over here for a friends birthday get-together, which is to say we probably won't be back.  My first impression as we grabbed a drink menu from the bar is that I wasn't sure what the theme was of the place. Was it a beer joint? Not really. Was it open seating? No. I'm still not really sure.  Their drink menu is decent, and they have several low price options which was good to see. They were pretty busy though and there were long stretches of time where no one was behind the bar. This meant we had quite a wait for drink #1.  Our group congregated by the dart boards as we didn't want to wait for a large table. Once we caught a waiter dropping off some food we asked if the two of us (my wife and I) could order some food and initially he didn't want to take our order. And when he did, he wasn't very pleasant about it.  Now to the food. We had wings and pizza because that's what we saw most people eating. The pizza itself was great - we had the margarita pie with an incredibly sweet chunky sauce and a nice crispy dough. The wings were supposed to be jerk wings but they didn't have much flavor, mostly were just coated with a dry seasoning which certainly isn't jerk.  If you do go, get the pizza, but otherwise this joint did less than impress.",

    "text": "Wow. Another 5 star review. Can I help it that PGH has some awesome places to go out and eat?  Went here for lunch with my wife today - we had it on our list since the Yelp Geeks Out party, where we enjoyed a sampling of some of their appetizers. Rachel had also written a lot of great things about the place, so we decided to check it out - so glad we did!  It's great to see a new place packed... PACKED for lunch. We were politely told by the hostess that we would have to wait for a table, but could sit at the bar and order if we wanted to. Once again, glad we did! The bartender was friendly, efficient, and attentive. He certainly was skilled at making a whole variety of interesting drinks for the patrons while we were deciding on our order.  We decided to try their shrimp 'tacos' (the taco shell is actually a rather tasty wonton, much like their tuna 'nachos') and a beet salad and shrimp salad. Awesome. The grilled shrimp were pretty much the tastiest shrimp I've ever had. Anywhere. The goat cheese and beet salad was tasty and filling, and the nice part was that both salads came with the dressing on the side, so you can dial it in or out as you see fit.  Prices are reasonable, and overall, this looks like a great place to have lunch or meet up with friends to watch a game or two. Will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "I visited Social with a friend, and we were both excited to try this place we had heard so much about! I live really close by, so it's a shame I hadn't tried it yet. I noticed right away that while there were vegetarian options, not many of them were remotely healthy or unique, which was a little disappointing. I went for the quesadilla with black beans and some kind of avocado cream. My friend ordered soup and a sandwich, and we shared fries.  The service at around 4pm on a Saturday was not extraordinary, but they weren't rude either. It was just slow during a slow period. The servers were knowledgeable and helpful, so they get points back there!   My food was good. Just good. Nothing really stood out, it wasn't a super memorable meal. More memorable to me is the environment that Social has, which is pretty casual and comfortable.   I hope to go back and try a few other things, but I don't find myself jumping at the opportunity even though it's one of the closest restaurants to my apartment and reasonably priced. I'd really like to see them offer more interesting options for vegetarians too, which is a big selling point for me.",

As salads go, it was mediocre.   Had a few of my buddy's fries which were amazing. He got the steak sandwich and said it was really good, although not as big as you would expect it to be for the price. A few folks at surrounding tables had pizzas that looked great. The service was fine. If I go back I'll get a pizza or sandwich and steer clear of the salads.",

    "text": "Had to make a trip to Target, so we stopped by Social for lunch first. They have outdoor seating but it was drizzling out, so we opted for indoors. We were brought to a table by the window and got to reap the benefit of natural lighting. Boyfriend chose the Eggs in Hell from the brunch menu and liked it (but wished it came with more than one small stainless steel sauce cup of tots). I got the Social burger (rare, minus tomatoes) from the normal menu. This was the rarest burger I've ever consumed (see photo; so much red if the picture does it justice), which is not a bad thing at all! I enjoyed the rareness quite a bit. It was so rare that it didn't taste much like meat--more like cheese or mashed potatoes? I don't know if they always make their rare burgers like that, but that's how mine was. Yum. The Social sauce was a nice finishing touch too. The main problem I had with the burger was that it was too salty, but luckily it didn't ruin the whole experience. The fries that it came with were good. They have multiple TV screens in the dining area, so that's a distraction for you if you're with boring company (not that I was :P). With great prices, friendly staff, and a casual atmosphere, this place is good for a brunch or lunch with friends.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5",

    "text": "This is a revised review.  I continue to have a love/hate relationship with this Bar, so I will attempt to be objective with this review.  The Ups: 1. It's the closest and only bar within walking distance of my house 2. I run into nice random people here all the time.  3. They rotate their drafts regularly 4. Free Wi-fi so I can watch my movie homework at the Bar 5. Roomie event space for groups 6. Outdoor seating  The Downs: 1. Overpriced Canned Beers 2. The original opening menu has been revised and they took off my favorite Caesar Salad [it came with awesome strips of anchovies] 3. There is an imbalance in staffing [more about this later] 4. You are oft forgotten by the Bartending staff because they know you come to hang out 5. Will give another try but the mixed drinks are awful 6. The food is hit or miss even if you continue to order the same thing [the attempt to substitute Kale for Spinach was a fail, the jerk wings vary in spicing and the meatball sliders have an overly intense seasoning]  The improved: 1. The Bartending skills and attentiveness has improved since they opened [between replacing the bar or training them to be better]  The latest: The reason I knocked the rating down to 2 stars rather than a more appropriate three or 4 is and remains the service. Personally, I am an efficiency freak [duh - CMU ops]. So I cannot help but comment on last Sunday's experience:  I visited on a Sunday at around 4:30pm so it must have been right when shifts were switching. The place was fairly empty as there were no sports games on TV and it was pretty cold outside, but that did not stop them from having 2 bartenders, the regular hostess and not 1, 2 but 4 waitresses on staff. Of these 4, only 1 of them was actually hustling and working. The remainder were BS-ing at the Bar with what I presumed to be the owner [recalling from memory once being introduced at the beginning of Social's existence] and it was almost unidentifiable whether their shifts were over or not. If they were on, you gained a sense of abandonment as a customer, who would routinely look around for refills on beers, if you were off shift, take off your aprons! Now I understand about giving your boss attention but still.  Same with the Bartenders, my regularly seen bartender would drift back and forth between the kitchen and within the Bar, however ignored my need to refill by Beer. It took a while to catch the attention of the second one, who stared at my 15% full glass and never bothered to ask if I wanted a refill. Now, I was doing homework, however I would have enjoyed my black and white movie more with an additional dark beer or two.  Naturally, will continue to come back from the given \"Ups\" listing above. But I seriously hope they smooth out their regular experiences.",

    "text": "I visited last night at around 6:45.  Because I was meeting CM here at 7, I decided to sit at the bar and take advantage of happy hour.  I was impressed by the long list of $2 beers, which included Woodchuck Amber hard cider, which I ordered.  Happy hour here seems quite popular--the bar was almost full at the time that I arrived, and was completely full by the time CM arrived--and given the selection and discount, I can certainly understand the attraction!  Once CM arrived, we got a table.  Having heard good things about the fried cauliflower patties, we decided to get an order of them to share.  (This worked out nicely, since one order comprises 4 patties.)  They were quite nice, esp. with the lemon aioli sauce drizzled on them, tasting similar to potato patties.  Cauliflower patties aren't an item that would normally hold a huge appeal to me, but I'd definitely recommend them!  For my entree, I ordered the turkey burger, since I'd also heard good things about it, and CM ordered the Social (beef) burger.  Based on other reviews, I was expecting a mind-blowingly delicious turkey burger.  Alas, this was not the case.  Paradoxically, the turkey patty and bun were extremely dry, whereas the toppings were overly moist.  As I ate the burger, the far end became soggier and soggier, to the point that I found it inedible, only finishing 2/3 of it.  The burger wasn't nearly as flavorful as I was hoping, either--I could barely taste the gouda cheese, and the lettuce and tomatoes didn't add much to it in terms of flavor, either.  In general, the ingredients struck me as low quality.  I ordered the cheesy tomato soup as a side, and it wasn't bad--it was thicker and creamier than Campbell's, though it wasn't quite as cheesy as I would have hoped, and I'm not sure how I feel about the toasted bready thing floating in it.  The burgers came with fresh cut fries, which was a nice touch, but they were nothing too special.  Aside from the food, service was pretty lackluster, with our waitress making minimal conversation, etc.--although she did keep our water glasses filled, which we appreciated.  As for the ambiance, I'd describe it as rather loud and somewhat boisterous--which I suppose is to be expected for a place called Social.  People were engaging in some fun activities, such as ping pong and darts, which was cool to watch.  Overall, with the exception of the cauliflower patties, I wasn't very impressed with the food at Social.  (I found out later that Social is owned by the same group that owns Shady Grove, for which I have similar feelings.)  If you want a solid turkey burger, I'd recommend checking out BRGR nearby. I'd consider returning for happy hour, but would definitely go elsewhere for dinner.",

It was later in the day around 1ish so it wasn't very crowded, however we got to sit next a meeting of the backwards hat club. Sorry, a personal pet peeve I HATE IT when men wear baseball hats in restaurants. Sure, yeah it was a Sunday brunch and I'm sure they partied hard the night before and it's not like Social is a \"fancy schmany\" place, but come one guys, take a freakin shower and comb your hair.    Okay, personal rant over. Anyway, my husband(who was NOT wearing a hat) ordered the corned beef hash and eggs and we were both impressed with that dish. I was lame and got a salad, but it was a well-sized portion and came with pickled eggs(!!!) which I love and was very pleasantly surprised by. I also ordered a virgin bloodie as I am currently expectin g and unfortunately we got charged the full price for a Bloody Mary and alcohol tax even though it didn't have any vodka and my husband just got coffee. We didn't make a big deal about it at the time, tax was only 28 cents. But, in future will definitely ask/follow-up on being charged for booze here and at other locations. Lesson learned.  I'm only giving this 3 starts for now, am interested in coming back for dinner and taking advantage of their on-tap beer selection once I have this baby.",

When I last visited, the service was extremely quick, friendly, and efficient.   As for the food, I really like their pizzas and their grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato soup. However, if you end up ordering the grilled cheese, the portions are smaller for that dish so it's possible to be not quite full from that dish.

I have tried a few of their appetizers, the tuna wrap appetizer is pretty awesome as well as hummus is pretty standard, the veggie dip, which was good, as well as the coli-flower patties which in my opinion are pretty excellent - love that sauce they use!!  In terms of their main dishes I love the Argentinian salad. This is really my go to dish when I am here. They use field greens, sauteed portobello mushrooms, I opt for medium rare steak, blue cheese, onions, and tomatoes all topped by a fried egg with some chimichurri dressing on the side, which is pretty spot on.   I have had a slice of their buffalo chicken pizza and their BBQ chicken pizza, which was pretty tasty as well. I especially like the fact that their crust is fairly thin.   In terms of service it is pretty good and have had no real complaints. Overall, this place is pretty solid and as long as their trivia and drink specials exist and they don't tweak their Argentinian salad, I will be coming back.",

    "text": "The worst service I've ever experienced.  Upon arrival, the manager acting as the host did not offer us the option to sit in their patio area and seated us at a high top table in the middle of the bar on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. Our server, Erin, introduced herself and brought us drinks and that was about all that she did during our meal.  After waiting about 45 minutes for our breakfast pizza and mushroom spinach scramble, I asked the manager who was walking by if he could please check on our food. In the meantime, our server did not stop at our table once. Other couples seated in our section that arrived after us had their meals come out and Erin refilled their waters and checked in with them all the while walking past us and not even glancing in our direction. The manager came back to tell us there was a large party ahead of us and we were about 2 tickets away. He refilled our coffee and was apologetic for the wait. After another 15 minutes, our food arrived. The breakfast pizza was extremely hot. The scramble was a mess and clearly made in haste, the \"toast\" was soggy bread not even toasted, and the tots were cold. The server finally came by after the manager had already gotten us butter and Sriracha and mumbled an apology about the wait and asked if we needed anything for the first time in an hour. My meal was inedible and after waiting an hour we got a few apologies and $2.70 knocked off our bill. As an experienced server myself, this was completely unacceptable service and management. Will not return ever again. Steer clear!!",

    "text": "I always ride past Social it usually has a large crowd .I read some good reviews and decided to try it . I was with a group of 8 people . They have a Groups of 6 or more gratuities are included policy . Which was very apparent because our waitress was awful . It was a Sunday afternoon not at all crowded she was just prancing around the room  she would show up then leave and not come back for what seems like forever she wouldn't even look our way .. We had 2 kids under 4 yrs old she never acknowledged them. at one point someone in our group had to get up and go get her . Other times we had to yell and wave across the restaurant for her attention . Before we knew her tip was included everyone was talking about this horrible service . Then it all made since she already had her tip included in the bill and she wasn't willing to work or put in effort for more . I work in the service industry . I actually work in a first class setting and she is everything a waitress shouldn't be . I let her know on my way out the door how her service was and she said Oh sorry you can fill out a comment card . Now to the food . One person in the group said it doesn't smell like any food is cooking and when we got our food it didn't taste like it either . I ordered the jerk wings . The jerk wings are not JERK . They were beyond crispy that chicken was over by about 5 min. The jerk wings are hook n fish wing dings with a chili dipping sauce on the side . Jerk requires a marinade of unbelievable spices I really want then to change the name some of my Jamaican friends would be appalled . The pizza was tasteless though it had a nice thin crust which I like but still no flavor . The Thai Shrimp tacos looked great but were ice cold and had no flavor . My sister had a $12 glass of Pinot Grigio which is a complete rip off  ..she didn't look at price before ordering she said oops .my drink Sangria with fresh fruit taste like raspberry lemonade no trace of alcohol.. The buffalo chicken pizza had to be sent back because of the huge globs of bleu cheese that overwhelmed the pizza  ..Like I said I'm a foodie also a cook with a excellent palate I won't be back . Nor would I recommend this to anyone ..Ugh",

Hmm for others it could be a hit or miss. Ya never know.  Drinks: There are several mimosa choices. I ended up with grapefruit mimosa. Yummy!  Service: Not too shabby. Our party sat outside. Our server seemed busy and did forget couple basic things but it happens. Although, later throughout the night it was odd. They have a \"bouncer\" who is poorly dressed and checks ids by the entrance. To make the place more welcoming, give him some kind of uniform...like a black polo shirt or something.  Then the guest became a little too drunk, a little too quick...which became humorous.   All in all, the place isn't too bad and I wouldn't mind coming back for the food and drinks.",

The staff was friendly and accommodating...I was seated and serviced quickly by Caitlyn, who by the way was super friendly and helpful.   I had my taste buds set and fixed on the \"Steak\" burger, unfortunately it was so good that it was sold out. I then shifted and ordered the \"Social\" burger...at first bite I was sold.   It was seasoned and cooked to sheer perfection. The fries it was served with will quickly remind your of the potato patch fries from Kennywood. (you know what I mean if your from the Burgh) only they were much better....so that says ALOT!   Social also has a bar with ample seating and tv viewing from all angles. The outdoor seating is great too.   Because I couldn't get the burger I originally wanted I gave a rating of 4 stars vs 5, however it was a 5 star experience all the way and a nice setup for me to return!   Great job Social! I'll certainly be back!",

Bad - I had the mushroom Panini and my partner the shrimp po' boy.  Eh.  I don't think the Panini was on actual Panini bread (seemed like just the bread ends or something) and the shrimp on the po' boy looked pretty dull and unappetizing. 3.  Good - French fries.  Done right, and fresh cut.  Dipped in ranch, which is the \"yummy\" ranch, very tasty. 4.  Bad - Loud, with dated music.  Maybe they're pandering to a certain generation (30-40 year olds), but I don't see why.  Google is right there, Bakery Square seems to be up and coming with youth, so why the \"oldies\"?  Was a penguins game night though. 5.  Good - outdoor seating.  Always a plus. 6.  Good and Bad - Beer.  The list is pretty long, but nothing too exciting.  Wish they had more local brews.  We did happen to go on a night where all cans were $2 or $3.  That's a great deal!  4 beers for $12.  That's the price of two drafts, depending on what kind of beer you drink, anywhere else.  Verdict - we'll stop again, but not on our list of tops.  Its a good place to go if you have some friends in from out of town, want a diverse and medium-priced menu, and don't mind the standard drink list.  Kids would also be fine there too.",

He was friendly, up beat, and made a killer mojito.  I went with my mom who was in town visiting, and we decided to order appetizers since it was happy hour. We got the Buffalo chicken dip, which is my favorite app and we also ordered the Reuben balls (not sure if that's what they are called). We really enjoyed the chips, but they still don't give you enough chips for the dip!! We didn't ask for any additional because I know they cost extra. The Reuben balls were ok. I've had them before and they were much better the first time around. As for dinner, we ordered my favorite a pepperoni and red onion pizza. It was delicious per usual. I actually love the pizza here. It's better than the local pizza shops by far and I don't mind spending a little extra on good pizza. They use a thick cheese and real pepperoni. The pepperoni is thick and tender. The onion gives the pizza a little zing and balances out the meat and cheese. And if you were wondering the small feeds two people!",

I lost my voice for 6 days after that, so I would never have a party there again. We even asked them multiple times to turn it down and they turned it up instead. Not very speedy with service.   I love the Asian salad. And their pizza is pretty good, too. Overall I would come here for good drinks.

Even though we just had happy hour drinks and apps, he remembered everyones order without even writing it down. He was very attentive to us and kept making a point to refill our waters. At the time that we were done, he gave us all separate checks without even having to ask! He remembered who had what, and even split shared items on checks. Normally servers have a problem with splitting checks, especially for how many people we had, but Griff did not. Overall he was a fantastic server and I look forward to seeing him the next time I come in!",

Outdoor seating, with game tables is a bonus. Pet friendly too.   Only complaint is that they seem to be google priced. Beer is way cheaper at WM Penn Tavern nearby, but that doesn't take any points off.",

    "text": "I've had hit or miss experiences with the food here.  The menu is large so at least there are lots of options.  I also love that they allow dogs on the patio.  This is why I continue to go there despite the slow service this place is notorious for.  However, after the experience I had today, I will not be back.  I showed up here with my dog and two friends right before a Steelers game. The patio was understandably packed, and after standing around for a few minutes without seeing a single staff member, we decided to seat ourselves. (I've been to social 5+ other times, and have never once been seated by a host)   All we could scrounge up were two 2-seat tables.  My bf began to move the two tables together since they were literally our only option.  An extremely angry employee charged very aggressively at my boyfriend and said \"DID YOU GO TO THE HOST STAND? NO! YOU DIDN'T! YOU'RE OUT HERE MESSING UP EVERYONE'S SECTIONS!\"    At that point, we just turned and left.  I will not ever be returning.  I can understand being annoyed that people are coming in and moving tables, but maybe there should be clear signage so people know that a host will eventually help them.  Beyond that, there is simply no excuse for a staff member to ball up his fists and posture like he's about to enter a fistfight with a customer.  My mind is absolutely blown.",

The menu itself consisted of unnecessary complicated twists on traditional brunch items, I'm assuming to appeal to more hipster crowds (i.e. see hipster Benedict on the menu). The menu just makes you ask yourself instead, \"which food will I probably hate the least\".    I got the French toast medallions and a couple of them weren't even cooked the whole way through. It was just mush on the inside, very gross and unsafe since it was essentially uncooked egg. Took a couple bites of my friends food as well (he got the breakfast burrito) and again- nothing to be impressed with. With how many breakfast places there are in Pittsburgh I can confidently say that I will not be going there again.",

    "text": "Had brunch at social for the first time today with a large group. I thought my food was pretty good, but the service was somewhat lacking.  When I arrived and asked if anyone from my group had shown up yet, the first waiter who spoke to me was super rude, and made fun of me, as if saying \"I'm looking for a large group, name ---\" is a bizarro thing to say when you come in! Then he went to \"double check\" and never came back. Luckily, a nicer waiter came while I was waiting and took me to my table with neither hesitation nor snark.  The restaurant was basically empty except for our table, but everything took forever to come out. Six of us ordered bloody marys (maries?) and it must have been 25 minutes before they came back. During that time, nobody checked with us about anything.  The bloody mary was enjoyable - it was very spicy, which I liked, but not very strong, which I didn't like so much. I ordered the breakfast pizza without the bacon, (tater tots on pizza just sounds delightful). It was ok, but the eggs were scrambled and pretty set, and there was no sauce. This made for a very dry pizza. I think it could have been much improved by a generous drizzling of some kind of sauce (a sriracha mayo maybe?)  The rest of their menu intrigued me enough that I will likely return for dinner. I hope I don't run into that waiter again, though.",

Brought my family there last weekend and ordered a bunch of appetizers and each ordered an entree. They brought nothing for a long time, forgot to bring one of our drinks, and never asked about refilling our drinks... Finally they brought the entrees, closely followed by the appetizers. I spoke to the manager about that one. Honestly, you'd think this was run by high school students.  The wait staff all seemed to be about 16 years old, perhaps 20 at most, and they seemed... confused....    OK, as for the food: we ordered wings, which were dry (not coated with a sauce like every other wing place I have been to).  Their pizzas are decent and served on little platforms that take up so much room that we ran out of room at the table. I ordered tacos, which were really unimpressive and kind of dry.  Overall not a good experience. Probably a good place to go after work and have a beer if you work at Google.  Not a place to bring a family. Too noisy and badly run.",

Parking can be rough in this area, so it was pleasant to deal with bike parking instead of car.   I started off with, what I would call, a \"rustic\" Bloody Mary that was awesome. Ordered fries for appetizer but they couldn't be awesome with awesome sauce because that is not vegetarian (Boo!). Fries alone were only ok, but then again, I don't share the same fry taste buds as most Burgher's because I don't like Kennywood fries!  The 2 small pizzas came and they were so filling that we were eating the leftovers for several days. The mushroom Bianca and the Roasted Cauliflower were so tasty!  All of the service was friendly but a bit slow. We've visited another time and it was the same. The acoustics were not the best. What I found odd was that the outside enclosure was pretty loud as well.  But this doesn't out-weigh the positives so we will go back.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I am very critical of restaurant staff because I am a fifteen year industry veteran and have zero tolerance for phonies. This place is filled with them.   We had a large party and a child. We ordered uncomplicated items and tried to make it as easy on the staff as possible.   Our server, Christian, did a great job and was the ONLY one hustling during a fairly brisk pace of business. She deserves a pat on the back and recognition for basically carrying her team the entire time we were there. I watched her running around the entire restaurant as the rest of the staff slowly meandered around shooting the shit and basically doing nothing.   I watched three times as our drinks sat at the service bar maybe 15 feet away from us while multiple staffers walked by, made conversation with the bartenders or by the computer station. I almost got up and told them to get our drinks multiple times but my girlfriend wouldn't let me as we were with her family. It was so annoying to see one person working so hard while everyone else had social hour... Maybe that's where they got their name, who knows.   Two of our food items were wrong but we only mentioned one issue which took far too long to resolve. We asked for more cheese on our pizza and it took LITERALLY 12 minutes to get our pie back. The 'manager' brought it back to us and apologized but after watching her underperform for the entirety of our visit I was less than willing to accept her apathy as authentic.   All in all it may be a good place to drink as their happy hour includes half off pitchers of shitty beer (they have good beer but its not included in happy hour, wtf) so there's that. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either, could be best described as concept-centric completely lacking in creativity.    Christian was the only saving grace. She was really trying and is the only reason we stayed. She should look for work at a better restaurant where her abilities won't be squandered.   We were given a gift card to return as a gesture from the same 'manager' but we passed it off to a neighbor who likes shitty beer as we will not be going back.   Get your act together or get out and make room for something worthwhile.",

Unfortunately, it's just the pizzas, salads, and some soups and apps. They don't have GF bread or buns for the sandwiches and burgers, which was disappointing. I started with the tomato soup, which was good but a little tart. The soup was slopped into the bowl and there was dried soup all over the sides, and it was served with crackers in plastic wrap (tacky). The margherita GF pizza was lackluster. They used sliced heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil, I just wished for more toppings and I wished the toppings went all the way to the crust. It's in a great location. I went one night for drinks and it was filled with 30 and 40 somethings and very bright. It is just ok.",

We ordered a large buffalo chicken pizza and we were not fans of it. If I could describe it, I'd say it was toasted bread soaked in buffalo sauce, with some blue cheese chunks and chicken scattered on the pizza. The pizza was dripping with buffalo sauce. That's what threw us off. The pizza crust was also too thin for us. The service was fine, and the setting was awesome. They had many other items on the menu, they might be great! We also did not order any drinks that night. This pizza was just not our favorite, and I would not go back for the pizza. I would like to go back and try some of their other choices!",

    "text": "I went in there with plans for a salad.  While the salads are awesome - they give you a paper menu and you pick out what you want thrown in, I didn't want to end up with a $40 salad.  And trust me, with toppings like grilled shrimp, steak cooked to order, artichokes, asparagus, cheeses galore - it would have definitely been 40 bucks.   So the hubby and I started with the ahi nachos.  I think it's a bit of a misnomer to call them nachoes since it was just single chips with tuna and guac on them, they were awesome no matter what they were called.  The tuna was very fresh and had a nice sauce on it.  The guac was the perfect amount.  The chip was super crispy and nicely seasoned.   We then decided to split the pierogie pizza and damn, are we glad we did.  It was gigantic, seriously huge.  The crust was cooked to a buttery golden brown and very crispy.  Very unique type crust.  It was covered with carmelized onions, bacon, sliced fingerlings and a garlic aoili.  Absolutely fantastic!  We will be back, oh yes, we will be back.",

Nacho app had great flavor but a little soggier than preferred. Loved the 'build your own salad' concept, but I wasn't impressed with the mahi. I'd try it again with chicken though. My husband's meatloaf sandwich with smashed egg was by far the best thing ordered at our table. We'd try this place again; the pizza at a neighboring table looked goooood.",

This was a dinner sized salad with lovely bits of edamame, carrot, and crunchy wonton strips. The steak was perfectly cooked and paired nicely with a spicy peanut dressing.    The service was a little rushed and scattered, but all in all, good.  At the end of our meal we were encouraged to stick around and drink more at the table, which I love (although I understand kicking people out to sit at the bar, I still hate it!).     Get your drinks while you can during happy hour, though, because the prices sure do get high afterwards!  I'd definitely be back and I'd be excited to take people here in the future.",

    "text": "Great happy hour stand-by. There is lots of free parking either in the surface lot at Bakery Square, or the parking garage, so that's a bonus. The place has a fun atmosphere in the evenings with sports on all the flat screens, darts, etc. The food is tasty, and the menu shifts often enough to be interesting. I would skip the brunch, which I have found to have no stand-outs (especially in light of the several other amazing brunch offerings in PGH), and instead head in for happy hour, which I think goes to 7 or 7:30 on weeknights. Great app and drinks specials. The hubs and I usually split 2 or 3 half price apps as dinner, and grab a couple of beers. The flatbread is great--as anything with bacon jam and a fried egg will be. The Rueben balls are great, and I don't even like ruebens. On the regular menu--the turkey burger is delicious, actually my favorite turkey burger anywhere. Skip the pizza, and resist the urge to get the chicken/waffle sandwich-- it's greasier than sin, and not as satisfying as you want it to be. Grilled cheeses are great. All in all--this will not be a healthy meal, but will hit the spot, and if you go during happy hour, can be pretty cheap.",

    "text": "We went to Social for Brunch this past Sunday around 1pm.  We had a great time.  We parked at the garage in Bakery Square and it's free for your first 3 hours.  That's all we needed!  It was pouring rain outside too so that really helped.       First of all the place looks great inside.  Anywhere that you sit you can see the television if you were watching a sporting event.  I always look for that when I review a place.  We sat in a booth but the bar looked great.  It's nice and open and I will sit there then next time that we visit.       I was really hungry so I ordered the French Toast Medallions.  My brother in law and his girlfriend ordered the Breakfast Burrito (without the chorizo) and wifey got the Hipster benedict.  They had no complaints about their food.  It looked good and they were stuffed after they ate.  My medallions looked great.  I couldn't wait to eat them.  They were really good I just wish I had more.  I was so hungry that I should have ordered a side of eggs to fill me up all of the way.  The French toast did come with 2 pieces of bacon that were very good but it still wasn't enough for me.  I think if I would have ordered the burrito or the hipster benedict I would have been more full.  Anyways that was my fault I should have known to order more.       Regardless it was a really good brunch.  My brother in law introduced us to a beermosa.  It was just a half of glass of orange juice with a half a glass of a lite beer.  It was really good.  I'm going to have that more often and it's cheap!         The only  negative was their service towards the end of our brunch.  I thought our waitress was really good at first.  Just after they served us our food she checked back once but she never came back after.  I wanted another drink and we would have ordered a few more if she ever came back.  We had to go out of our way to flag her down just to get our check.  That was really weird because she was great at first.  Oh well we will still comeback and probably just sit at the bar next time.",

    "text": "Drink specials are fine, pizza is fair, but the food overall leaves something to be desired.  Came in for dinner here, it seems more of a drinking place than eating, which is a shame since they're clearly trying to be a restaurant and attract customers who may be staying at the hotel across the parking lot (I was, BTW).  It was a Thursday evening, I ordered a beer that caught my attention on the menu. It's $6 per 12oz can here just to warn you. However, since this was Thursday, 12oz cans from a certain brewery were half price. But I was not told of this by the waiter, and didn't find out until it was too late, so I ended up paying $6/12oz. Thankfully I only had a couple beers, but really they should inform customers if a special is on for certain drinks on certain days, because i would've gotten the beer on special for $3/12oz if I'd known.  I ordered the appetizer \"Reuben Fritters\". Description is: Corned beef, Swiss, rye, and sauerkraut, fried to perfection with Social's house sauce. This was not good, plain and simple. It was just deep-fried balls of batter, with some meat and other stuff mixed into it, that had no taste. This dish has corned beef in it, which is famous for strong flavor. This dish has sauerkraut in it, which is famous for strong flavor. This dish has rye in it, which, likewise, is famous for strong flavor. Well, I couldn't taste any of these flavors in the fritters. All I could taste was the fried batter. The dish was just so BLAND, even the \"social sauce\" they put on it couldn't save it. Severely disappointing, which is too bad because a dish like this has so much flavor potential given its ingredients, but either it's not being cooked in the right way, or the chef simply cannot cook it.  For my main, I ordered the Social Distortion pizza: Consists of: marinara, mozzarella, banana peppers, salumi, roasted mushrooms and oregano. It was fairly decent. The pizza in general is cooked pretty well at Social; crust is crispy and it's easy to break off triangles and eat by hand. You'd be surprised how many pizza restaurants can't even get this right. The toppings on this are supposed to be unique to the restaurant I guess, but I didn't really find them special or all that different to what I might get somewhere else. Seasoning was nothing special either, so it was a decent pizza, nothing more nothing less.  2 stars means you were disappointing, Social, but you were not horrible. But in this case it also means that I KNOW you can do better. Especially with those Reuben Fritters. What are you thinking taking ingredients that are known to be so flavorful, and deep-frying them to hell so that they have no flavor left? Maybe it's because there's more drinking than eating going on in your restaurant, that customers don't notice this? Well, I did. You need to step up your game, and I definitely think you could. The pizza at least has a solid foundation but I think this place could improve on that too, with seasonings and fresher ingredients and the like",

In True cheapskate form, we made a meal out of just appetizers. Penny pinchers unite! Don't let the appetizer title fool you, these portions were pretty hefty! My friend ordered a plate of tots and ended up with enough to feed a tiny army. She also got an order of the jerk wings which she thought was delicious. For myself, I ordered the black bean quesadilla. SO GOOD! The black bean filling was great and avocado crema was a nice complement. Last but certainly not least, I had the roasted red pepper hummus which came with pita and tortilla chips - also fantastic! We each got 2-3 meals out of it and paid less than $10 each. Success!  The ONLY thing keeping me from giving Social a 5 star rating is the horrendous customer service. My friend arrived first and was not acknowledged by our waiter until 20 minutes after being seated. Once we were finished with our meal, we wasted half an hour trying to find him to get our checks. I was 5 seconds away from calling up a search party. The dude was seriously M.I.A.! We ended up asking another waitress to fetch us our check because it was getting ridiculous. Even though it was a rocky experience with our waiter, I would absolutely come back because the food is great and the happy hour deals are just too good to pass up!",

There is an outdoor patio which is spacious and the inside is well decorated with outstanding service. prices are good for portion size!   We got the mac and cheese (10/10), tomato and cheese soup, the kale caesar, shrimp salad, and the chicken salad wrap. The mac and cheese is oven baked in a skillet with the perfect hint of spice. Not overpowering but gives the dish something a little extra that you wouldn't normally taste in mac and cheese. The kale caesar has these homemade croutons that I honestly would buy an extra side of. The chicken salad is unique as well. it had peas in it which I never had in a chicken salad before but it was amazing!   Really good restaurant! I would consider it a cafe because of the soup and salad options, but I also heard the pizza is great. Will have to test that out next time!",

It's a nice spot but the decor confused me? Brick and bark and 4 styles of lights. What are trying to be? Staff: 5/10 - Our server was very nice and attentive enough to make it a pleasing experience. The hostess, however, seemed to really not care for her job. Not going to get into details but I just feel that if you're the *first face* the customer sees, you should at least attempt to be friendly.   Food/Drinks: 7/10 - Meh. Moscow Mule didn't come in a copper mug which would be fine if it were tasty. Nachos were subpar (and your girl LOVES nachos). I got the steak salad and it was very good. Nothing special.  Overall Experience: 6/10 - Social won't ever be my \"first choice,\" but I'd go again if someone asked me to meet them there.",

Every time I go to Social something is seriously wrong with the service.  Today, I was told by the bartender (I had lunch at the bar) that wine was 50% off so it might more sense to buy the bottle (rather than order 1 glass) and take what is left over home with me.   So, I did just that.   When the bill came, my JW Morris Pinot Noir was billed at $18.00.  When I asked if a full bottle was really $36, the bartender said yes.  SAY WHAT?  I swore it was much less than that on the menu and it retails in a wine store for around $15.00.    There was not a drink menu to be found when I went looking for it and the bartender didn't offer to show it to me...I'm just sayin'!  Oh and the burger came out cold but the fries were nice and hot.",

My date and I sat at the bar and both ordered appetizers and drinks to share. First drink my date got - cracked glass.  They just poured that drink into another glass.  What if there was a sliver of glass that made it's way into the cup?  A new drink should have been made.  I know it seems wasteful, but it's better than injuring someone.  Then...it took significant effort to get the attention of anyone to get more drinks.  Thank goodness we didn't want more food.  The bartenders were too busy flirting with the ladies at the end of the bar.  Or maybe they were regulars.  Regardless - you never know who your next regular could be.  My second experience, again was - eh.  I probably won't go back.  My co-worker and I decided to go after completing a few weeks of what seemed like HELL at work.  We were both looking forward to a grilled cheese and tomato soup.  What a disappointment!  I would have rather gone to panera for their tomato soup.  Our waiter - again, took significant effort to get attention.    What got us is the picture I posted.  Before I posted it, I checked their menu and the other pictures on here.  Sometimes restaurants spell things different because \"that's their thing\".  Yeah, learn to spell special correctly.  These were cards on ALL the tables and the bar.    Just disappointed all around both times.  I drive past Social every day on my way home from work.  It'd be a great happy hour location, but after my 2 experiences, I'm doubtful there will be a third.    The only reason they got 3 stars is their Cauliflower patties are pretty awesome.",

I understand that the place is fairly new (I think right now it is not even 2 months old) but the service stuff, even though polite and helpful seem to not be aware of the menu and some basic processes (e.g., remembering orders, splitting bills, leaving straws for drinks etc.).  Coming to the food part I have mixed feelings.  Whatever I have tried tasted ok, however many times most of the people in my company are not really satisfied with their plates.  All in all, I think I will give it a try again but maybe a couple of months later so as people to have some time to improve.",

I felt compelled to write this review after noticing some lackluster reviews on yelp. The service was great. The hostess and wait staff are pleasant and upbeat and worked to accommodate seating for us, as our party grew from three people to six quickly. Our server, Dan, was very helpful throughout the evening, making suggestions on substituting different greens in the grilled shrimp salad, since some of us were not fans of kale. Social's willingness to do so, where many kitchens frown on substitutions, was noted and another reason to love this place!  The food was flavorful, fresh, and plentiful. Grilled shrimp salad and southwest salads were group favorites and they had fresh, delicious salad dressings (on the side). The salads were large, but amazingly they disappeared - many clean plates in this group! The turkey burger was declared flavorful.  Drinks were also good. We ordered the happy hour special- 2 for 1 social cocktails. The \"social punch\" was fruity, not heavy on alcohol, and at half price, a great deal. Served in mason jars. Nice. Didn't have wine, but it was just $5 per glass and many beers for $2.  The decor is urban, the outdoor patio is kept comfortable in cool weather with heaters, kind of a neighborhood bar/restaurant feel that we enjoyed. The only negative is the loud background noise I think dining area. The music could be lowered as the place fills up. We decided to sit outside, which was a bit quieter.   We'll be back soon.  (Also note- Garage with 3 hours free parking nearby. Can't beat that!)",

He wasn't wrong the place was pretty good, nothing amazing, but good. Service itself was ok, a lot of times our waitress would simply walk past us when we all had empty glasses on our table but it was quite busy and the food came out quickly so it's a rough in between I guess. The food for the main course itself was pretty good, not terrible but nothing special either. I had the Reuben and my parents had salads (I forget which ones) and all of our meals were quite large. My Reuben tasted quite nice, albeit really greasy but good none the less. We also had their nachos for an appetizer and I have to say that those were probably the nastiest thing I've ever eaten in my life, it was like eating overpriced Taco Bell, so skip those. They do have a full bar though, so if you want to knock back a few drinks they had some nice specials going like $3 Leinenkugel drafts among others. All in all its a decent stop, not some place I'd recommend to go to regularly or actively seek out, but if you're in the area and it's a convenient stop for you, you should go.",

I think the restaurant could have done a better job of controlling these issues and creating a pleasant dining experience for everyone. We both ordered \"build your own\" salads, which is a bit copy-cat from Bites and Brews, but is a nice option for those of us with food intolerances. The salads were good, but nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a nice outdoor space to eat, this place is great, but I wouldn't make the trip for the food or drinks otherwise.",

We had our dogs with us and luckily they have a very spacious patio outside so this wasn't a problem. Our waiter was superb! Often times when you sit outside you can feel forgotten about, but he was great about checking on us..refilling drinks..etc. Plus he was super warm and friendly without being over the top. I was in the mood for something healthy so I was ECSTATIC when I saw the \"build your own salad\" paper! Such a neat idea! It was pricey, but then again I put everything but the kitchen sink in mine so that added to the cost. My only complaint would be that the portion was way too small for the price, but other than that it was yummy and fresh tasting. By far the best part of this dining experience was the drinks! OMG. On Tuesdays they have 2 for 1 mixers so I got the berry margarita and my friend got (wait for it...) PUMPKIN SANGRIA! Both were phenomenal! Just the right amount of sweetness to alcohol ration and the sangria was one of the best drinks i've ever tasted.   Overall a great lunch and i'm so excited to have a place this cool so close to my house.",

Natural wood and terrarium accents clash with bright lights and colors which compete with the multitude of TVs which interrupt the idea that this is a place where you would come to have conversations which questions the whole pro-new-media-we-are-located-in-the-same-building-as-google vibe. But I can kind-of get it; it is Pittsburgh's updated version of socializing (watching and talking about sports in a bright and airy post-industrial space while posting on Facebook and Instagram, or whatever, via smartphone). However, I don't think the atmosphere appeals to anybody in particular, certainly not to me, even though I love terrariums; and I've heard sports fans complain that they keep the volume off (or maybe it was too low) on the TVs (that's just what I heard, could be a rumor! But that's a natural consequence of Social contexts).  I half expected Social to have more techy stuff, like iPads at the table with apps that allow for communication with other tables to play games of sorts or select the music, or something, I wouldn't know. So, I've tried the veggie burger and it was just OK, and I had some pizza at an event once which was also alright. Then, there's a couple of REALLY well crafted things about Social: The Brooklyn Bridge and The Bourbon Blast.",

My biggest complaint is the poor service. We came in on a Monday for dinner, which apparently is their trivia night. The music and announcer's microphone were so ungodly loud, we could barely place our orders with the waitress, let alone have dinner conversation. We asked if they could lower the volume, and were told that the trivia emcee doesn't like to go lower. Seriously? So, your emcee trumps your paying customers? If I were going to a rowdy bar, I might understand, but not at a casual restaurant. They did offer to reseat us at a farther away table but the speakers were still so loud it made no difference. Sure, the food is decent and it's nearby, but the insolent customer service is enough of a turnoff to make this a \"if it's the apocalypse and this is the only place to eat\" kind of restaurant.",

The kraut has a great texture and flavor. It's grilled without being \"smashed\" like some places are known to do. I give the sandwich a FIVE but I'm rating the overall experience a four because it is a tad loud if you're seated next to the bar and the wait staff were assigned too many tables to really be attentive. They tried, though.",

Their drinks are on the pricy side when not on special, but unless there's only one thing you drink, you can find something very affordable. 2. FREE PARKING!  It's super close to where I live, but I can convince friends to join me over in 'Sliberty because of the ample ample free parking--both surface and garage. 3. Tasty tasty pizza.  The green eggs and ham...oh man. Rarely do I order the same thing twice, but I've had that delicious pizza on several occasions.  The pizzas look pricy from the outset, but once you see their size, it makes some sense--2 can easily split a large with a couple of slices to take home. 4. Friendly service! I've sat at the bar most of the time, and have gotten great recommendations from them.  They're generous with the pours (my companion had ordered a beer that came off the tap with a thick head of foam, and without any prompting from him, the bartender pulled him a fresh pour), and well-informed about the menu (allergies, etc).  But for Pete's sake, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FLOOR. I realize they're going for something a little \"industrial-chic\" but the floor is a huge eyesore, especially in the bathrooms.",

The prices averaged maybe $1 per item higher than the many comparable places in Shadyside.  Which begs the question, why come to a less pleasant neighborhood for the same menu we can find (slightly cheaper) nearby at Mario's, Harris', Shady Grove, Bites and Brew, Elbow Room, 1947, etc?  There was also a diner with a dog on the patio while we were there.  I personally find it slightly off-putting to see a dog licking off one of the dishes.  But, if you have a dog, it might be a pet-friendly place to go for a meal.  I noticed another there as I was passing by today.  I wouldn't mind going back if someone I was with wanted to, but I just can't see a compelling reason to chose this place over the similar options on Walnut or Ellsworth.",

I got there quite early and sat at the bar; figured I would just have a drink until she got there.   I ordered a lemon drop martini--a favorite drink, and something that most bars can handle. I have no idea what the bartender put in this. I think it was sour mix and a very small amount of vodka, based on how incredibly sweet it was. The bartender asked if it was ok; I said it tasted awfully sweet so he kindly offered to add more lemon juice. He added quite a bit more \"juice\" from a container behind the bar and the drink tasted exactly the same--which is why I think it was sour mix. Oh well, I thought, I can stand to drink this and I'll switch to wine afterwards.   The bartender apologetically explained that he \"is not a martini person\" and left. Fine, I get that...but this isn't a complicated drink and *you are a bartender*.   I finished that drink and waited about ten minutes for the bartender to notice (again, at about 5pm on a Tuesday, when the bar was perhaps 1/4 full). He finally came over. I ordered a glass of wine. My friend texted to say she was finally on her way. Five minutes later, still no glass of wine in sight. I told her it wasn't worth coming and we met at Casbah instead.  I finally flagged down the bartender ten minutes after this. He seemed to have no recollection of my wine order so I paid and left. Definitely won't be back! The specials were...nothing special, and certainly didn't rival the many better happy hours in the Shadyside area.",

Speaking of looks, my present company did not receive welcoming looks from management during our recent visit at this establishment and service was weird overall! Not worth the food, trip, neighborhood or price at all. They should be re-named Anti-Social instead!",

Half priced mimosas on Saturdays which was a nice surprise, but still $4 even half off. Generous size of the drink, though. I like that the mugs of coffee were large too.   The waitress was attentive and made sure our water and coffee was topped off.  I ordered the scramble and it was fine. It had too much cheese for my taste and made it a little too heavy, but the portion was generous. The wheat toast was served a little burnt and hard, and we had to ask for butter. Not sure who eats dry toast with breakfast! It also came with tater tots, which were just normal.  Overall, social is a safe choice because of their large dining room and available parking lot. Nothing too crazy to write home about either way, better during the weekdays for their happy hour specials.",

Their happy hour features a long list of $2 and $3 beer and half off appetizers! Some of the \"must try\" options are their nachos, buffalo chicken dip, and fries.  They offer a merlot blue cheese to dip the fries in that is AMAZING and I cannot go without. In the summer, their outside patio is lit up and a wonderful atmosphere, and inside is fun, too. My only concern is sometimes service has been very slow/inattentive.  However, don't let that steer you away!   PRO TIP: 3 FREE hours of parking in the Bakery Square parking garage!",

Ordered a turkey sandwich and I order the French Onion soup. The sandwich order came on 2 plates because our waitress thought we were sharing. Nope! Never even mentioned sharing. After a few minutes of not receiving my soup I asked her and she forgot put in the order! I think she even wrote it down. When it finally came it was hot but served in a very small bowl. I'd call it more of a cup. The croutons were garlic which is different. It was hot when I finally received it.",

On this night, nearly all of the beers are priced at $2 or $3 and the selection is pretty good. The waitstaff can be slow and forgetful sometimes, but always very outgoing, friendly, and apologetic. The food is decent as well, particularly their build-your-own salads. However, there is one factor every Wednesday night which every potential Social-goer should be aware of, the dart league. Every sh@* can night, about 20 of the most impolite people in Pittsburgh swarm over half of the bar like a bunch of gnats seeking rotten fruit. I am a fan of participating in bar sports myself, but one must be aware that there is certain etiquette to abide by whilst playing games, or doing anything else, in the presence of other people. These pathetic, ignorant lowlifes pour their heart and soul into throwing objects at a board, carelessly stampeding and shouting around the bar like they own the place. I've seen them slamming barstools and glasses, standing over other patrons' tables while they're eating or trying to watch the tvs hung above the bar, and I saw one guy scream in the ear of a +80 year old woman, making her cry, because one of them hit a double 18. This unkept, careless faction of the bar practices reprehensible behavior every Wednesday night and I highly recommend sitting on the other side of the bar, if you even go at all. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.. at least until Social does something about these awful people. Otherwise, Social would be a great place to eat, drink, and socialize.",

The space is a bit industrial, but also very open and conducive to socializing.  The menu has fun \"prompts\" written along the top in case you need a little help getting the conversation started.  Or you could go with my preferred method of social lubrication, alcohol, and get yourself a drink from the fully stocked bar.  Your choice.  The menu is standard bar food, kicked up a notch and freshened up a bit.  Instead of plain ol' nachos and cheese, they're serving up a delicious app of ahi tuna nachos, complete with guac, wasabi, and sriracha.  Be aware: this dish comes pre-portion controlled, aka you get five nachos, individually topped with an appropriate amount of ahi tuna and guac.  This is a good thing, because you'll have plenty of room to enjoy your main course.  I went with a salad known as \"The Beet\", a lovely combo of arugula, goat cheese, walnuts, roasted beets, green apple, and orange walnut dressing.  From looking back at the menu, I also noticed that this salad contained an item known as \"roasted reds\". I cannot recall what the \"roasted reds\" were, I may need to go back and investigate. But I digress.  Mystery item or not, the salad was tasty.  For all you picky salad eaters out there, Social offers a \"Social Market\" option, where you can use a little mini golf pencil and a checklist to create your own salad.  Perfect for when you're feeling particularly persnickety.  Finally, the drinks.  I was sticking with plain old water on this trip, but I did stare longingly at at the pitcher of sangria across the bar.  They've got a small but diverse wine list, some interesting cocktails, and a few \"social mixers\" that can be ordered by the pitcher.  They also have a blackboard of seasonal drafts and a large selection of canned beers.  Be sure to check out the daily specials, \"Martini Monday\", \"2 for 1 Tuesday\" etc. for deals.",

Very bland, poor quality, cheap meat, can mushrooms, watery chili, flavorless cheese. Black bean quesadilla is just a can of black beans with no seasoning inside a chared tortilla..beans were cold. Not served with salsa or sour cream....plus I think they stole the layout and theme of Burgatory. You can customize a salad, however it will cost you about $20 for toppings on it. on the plus or minus side, depending on preference you can bring your dog. we were sat at an outdoor table next to three dogs, we asked to move, kind of annoying. overall if you want a fun place to drink this is ok, but don't go for the food.",

Although a bit pricy, I don't mind going here because I know I'll always have a good time. The atmosphere is super fun - indoor or outdoor seating, bar, big TVs, corn hole, ping pong tables, people bring dogs - it's great. (also kid friendly)  As far as food, my regular is the grilled cheese with orzo as a side - really good! I've also had the cauliflower patties, pizza, and brunch. All great!",

    "text": "This restaurant has the rudest manager ever. We had a coupon that they sent us a week or so ago on the LoyalTree app. When our server said he wouldn't honor it, the manager came out and told us we were using the wrong app (even though they sent us a coupon in this app). He didn't know the name of the correct app though and refused to honor our coupon and just kept saying he would give us the coupon if we downloaded the app (which he didn't know the name of). He just kept telling us he didn't know how the app works because he \"doesn't do coupons\" even though he is the manager of the restaurant that gave us a coupon. Eventually another server came over and set the record straight and we got our discount but this experience completely ruined Social for us. We've been there a bunch of times in the past since we live near by but we will never be going back. Previous experiences were that the food and service was OK, maybe 3.5 stars on average.  That's down to one star now due to a Manger who didn't know how their own app works and who literally yelled at customers in the restaurant.",

When I reached the bar, there was no one on the side that I was sitting on. I waited about 5 minutes before the waitress even greeted me. She asked if she could help me and I told her I never received a menu. After asking about vegan options, I decided to just use the create your own salad feature. It took another 15 minutes for her to even come and grab my slip, after walking past me at least 5 times, taking other people's orders. At this point there are at least 6 others on my side. They are receiving appetizers and meals and yet I still hadn't received my salad and fries, which was a to go order. She finally brings my bag of food over, which apparently had been sitting there for quite a bit. I pay my tab & she brings me back the wrong amount of change. I wait a few more minutes and then I had to basically yell for her attention. I started to ask for a manager but I decided to write this review instead. I will never go back there. Oh and my fries were awful.",

We were quickly greeted by Aubrey (?) who started us off with 2 beers (a 21st amendment IPA for my boyfriend and a Slyfox 113 IPA for me) and waters. Just FYI, pretty sure they have only cans and a few draft selections-no bottles. Friday was half price bottles of wine but we both stuck to beers. The menu I'd classify as \"new American\"-pizzas,salads,sandwiches,etc. My boyfriend started off with the soup of the day-a chilled squash soup with basil and creme freche. I had only a spoonful but can report it was yummy. A great cold soup for a warm summer evening! For entrees, I ordered the cheesy bacon grilled cheese on white. It came with a side,of which I chose the side salad with jalepeno lime dressing. The grilled cheese was apple bacon and some gouda. It was tasty but the bread overwhelmed the ingredients. I felt there should have either been less bread or more ingredients. The salad was a standard salad but the dressing was excellent-had a spicy kick naturally, being jalepeno dressing. My boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich with fries. On the Cuban was swiss,pork,capicola,pickles,and Dijon. He said it was very tasty but did not resemble a \"typical\" Cuban. I noticed a lot of tables had pizzas and they smelled delicious so I'd love to go back and try a pizza. It was not too loud outside at all and our service was good so really no complaints on our dining experience!",

    "text": "I wasn't expecting anything special given the quality of reviews here, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's not anything gourmet, but my sister and I had a very pleasant time having dinner here.   It was a nice cool evening when we came so we decided to sit at one of the outside tables - a very cute little area to sit and chat, and the tables aren't too close together for comfort. Bakery Square is pretty adorable, with kids nearby playing ping pong and people enjoying the patio with their dogs.   I ordered the classic pierogies for a starter; this was the least impressive part of my meal. I'm from Buffalo, so I was interested to compare the pierogies here to those at home, with both cities having such significant Polish populations. Unfortunately based on this sample, Buffalo definitely wins - these were decently tasty, but more or less had the quality of something that you could get out of a box in the freezer section of the grocery store (still though, how much can you really mess up dough filled with potatoes and cheese!). Also were way too drenched in butter, to the point of leaving our lips feeling greasy.  I'm pleased to report that the entrees went over much better. I had a Reuben sandwich, which was delicious. Really loaded up with corned beef, and the flavors of the meat, kraut, and sauce melded in a really pleasant and tangy way. The French fries were also above average quality, for this type of casual restaurant. My sister was similarly pleased with her Buffalo chicken sandwich.   Overall, would be happy to return here on my next visit to Pittsburgh, and could see myself hanging out here often with friends due to the casual, low key atmosphere and solid quality of the food at a decent price.",

    "text": "TL/DR : Social is : a GREAT place for groups, a great place for a drink, and a good place for food after said drink. But it's not .... the best .... if you are there to have a meal that is quality in a quiet or even medium noise level space. If you are allergic to dogs sit inside! They DO allow dogs on their porch which is awesome  It's a good place to watch the game with friends and just an all around welcoming place that could use some tweaks on the front end of service   I deducted two stars due to quality of food and service.   Social, it's a place I walk by or ride by nearly everyday. And yet it took me months to get there. My date and I chose this place because it was convenient. It was trivia night (Monday night!) so not to knock trivia but we wanted to sit outside to avoid the noise. Trivia night is pretty loud.   When we asked for outdoor seating they were accommodating, until I asked to be seated fully under the covering; and the hostess wanted to know why. I had to quickly make a reason up, that she found sufficient, so we could be moved.   The noise outside wasn't much better. And legit everyone had a dog. I'm a HUGE dog lover; but if you are afraid of dogs or allergic this might not be the place for you (outside at least! ).   So right now I'm taking one star away -- for the hostess experience -- it wasn't accommodating and I felt unnerved that they asked why we wanted to switch to a table that wasn't in the sun.   Onto the food. The fries are good! Really good. Get those. I had the veggie burger and it was cold / tasted like it had maybe come from an expensive box. It was dry and if I wasn't really hungry I wouldn't have eaten it at all. My date had the turkey club and he couldn't eat it. I had to take a star off for food quality.  Our server was nice but it took forever to get the check.  The bill for drinks, apps, and two dinners was only $35! as well . look forward to going back; but not on trivia night and I won't get that veggie burger again haha!",

My sister and I split the Mac and Beer Cheese, Pretzels with beer cheese (not mustard), and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.   To say the least, everything was extremely bland and honestly mediocre. We personally were not a fan of the Mac and Beer Cheese. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza tasted extremely bland - I totally wasn't expecting this because it looked so good!! Our favorite item we tried were the Pretzels (we decided to get them with beer cheese instead of mustard). Again, the pretzels were pretty basic with nothing special to them. Our favorite part was the beer cheese dip, which was the only item that really stood out to us.   I probably would've given this place 2 stars based strictly on the food, but thanks to the lively and fun atmosphere it receives 3 stars from me!  If I decide to come here again, it'll probably just be to grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere.",

In terms of food, they used to have a kale and artichoke dip which was outstanding, but when we went a few days ago, it was spinach and artichoke dip. I'm sure it's still amazing though. The first time I went there, I made my own salad with falafel, goat cheese, apples, and walnuts and it was absolutely incredible. Recently when we went, I got the gluten free mushroom bianca pizza. It was lacking seasoning and a whole salad basically came on top of my pizza, but it was still alright. The crust itself was delicious for it being gluten free. My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken pizza, and the rest of my family got sandwiches which they all said were delicious. The fries however were way overdone and again, lacked seasoning.  The drink selection here is amazing! I recommend either getting a moscow mule or a salty dog cocktail because they were phenomenal and STRONG!   We had a little problem with out waitress though. My dad asked for tator tots, which he did not get, and was still charged extra for them. We paid it anyway because it was a dollar, but still, we paid a dollar extra for food he did not get. Additionally, the waitress came around several times, but never asked if we wanted any more drinks or anything like that. I don't know if it was an off day or if she was new, but still.  Overall, I'd say go here if you're looking to grab great apps and watch sports and have good drinks.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing. I ended up with a terrible stomachache and nausea after eating at Social. The food and service were very bad too.  First, I ordered the grilled mushroom panini on gluten free bread and added grilled chicken to it. I also got a side of tater tots instead of french fries. The panini, as listed on the menu, had grilled mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, and arugula pesto on it. In reality, there was only like one tiny mushroom in the entire panini. There was hardly any grilled chicken, so  I was baffled by the upcharge for it since they don't even add that much in the panini. The arugula pesto did not taste like pesto at all, it was bland and just tasted like they threw some arugula in a food processor and called it a day. The \"roasted tomatoes\" tasted like those crappy sundried tomatoes you buy at Giant Eagle. Once again, they only threw one little \"roasted\" tomato in the entire panini. A complete waste of 17 dollars.   A few hours later, I end up with a terrible stomachache and nausea, to the point where I almost threw up. I was up all night with this terrible stomachache. A day later and I'm bloated like a pufferfish. I'm guessing it's the \"gluten free\" bread they used to make my panini. Because the bread they used did not even look like gluten free bread- I've been gluten free all of my life so I'm smart enough to know what the different types of gluten free bread look like and taste like. Gluten free bread is typically grainy, dense, and has a lot of seeds (think chia or flax) in it. The bread I had was not like this at all, but that doesn't mean it was good- it was stale.   Finally, the service was horrible. My waiter would disappear and I kept having to flag him down. At one point, I had to get another waiter to go get my original waiter. I understand that waiters are busy and have other tables to take care of, but please, don't disappear from your customers and not come back!   My fellow gluten free friends, please do not go to Social unless you want to be on the toilet all day/night long. But in general, the food here is poor quality and the service is poor. I'm not one to give harsh, 1-star reviews like this review, but in this case, I felt the need to. I can't believe I dropped almost 20 dollars on a sandwich that tasted like garbage. Definitely not coming back.",

That being said, Social is a solid choice for Happy Hours and work lunches, with plenty of food and drink options to keep everyone happy.  I appreciate their ability to accommodate a gluten free dietary restriction, especially given how bread- and flour-heavy bar food can end up being. The gluten free options are plentiful, and their gluten free buns are really fantastic. I actually had to double check the first time I had a burger to make sure the bun was actually gluten free.  Overall, the food is decent, and great for when you're looking for a burger or some wings, but the atmosphere can be very loud and unpleasant depending on the time. I came for lunch with a friend and it was already borderline too loud for a normal conversation. I will definitely return when I get the hankering for a burger or some tater tots.",

The wait staff is attentive, and they know the menu well and are able to make good suggestions.   I like the craft beer selection, especially the East End Big Hop.

We ordered the cauliflower patties off the appetizer menu. We didn't realize we would get 4 patties! They were really good and I'm glad there were some left to bring home.  For our entrees we ordered the chicken and waffles and the mushroom panini. My panini was just okay, nothing to write home about but wasn't bad by any means. My husbands chicken and waffles were really good.  I think Social is fair in price but you have to go for that happy hour deal. They have a nice outdoor area to sit in which we took advantage of. Perfect for summer days.  We parked in the garage which is free for your first 3 hours. We will be back again and most likely for happy hour!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Social, I really did, yet while they have a great space, both the service and food was lacking.  I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my fiance and two other dining companions. My fiance and I had been looking forward to coming here since we noticed that it opened.  From the street it looked like a fun place and the same could be said whenever we walked up to it.  Outside of the restaurant is some patio seating and a ping pong table while the inside has a dominating bar in the middle with seating around the outside.  There is a lot of open space though and so it feels quite large.  After looking at the menu I was having a hard time making a decision as to what I wanted for dinner.  This night I was not in a mood for a sandwich which pretty much left me the options of having a salad or a pizza.  They did have an interesting concept for the salad though where you could make your own.  They had a pad of paper and you could pick the toppings that you wanted on the pad and give it to the server.  I ended up passing on that as it seemed too pricey and ultimately went with a large Pierogie Pizza.  Whenever it came out my first though was that the name was misleading as the pizza had cheese, some onions, scallions, some potato pieces that reminded me of home fries, only a bit larger, and pancetta.  Granted I know that in its simplest form a pierogie is potato, dough and topped with onions but I still think they would be better off to call this a loaded baked potato pizza as that resemblance is much stronger.  No matter what it was called, I can't say that I enjoyed it too much though.  The crust was at least done right as it was a little crispy and had a good taste to it.  The sauce was MIA and I honestly couldn't tell if there was any of the garlic oil that was mentioned on the menu on my pizza.  Finally the toppings were good although not exactly what I had been expecting with the caramelized onions being my favorite part.  Beyond the food I have two other things to note about our experience.  The first is that our waitress was slooow.  I understand that she had tables both inside and outside (poor decision by the manager?) but she went missing for long periods at times which made it difficult to order extra drinks.  The second item is that one of our dining companions had a quite large and sharp piece of a walnut shell in her salad.  She bit into it and hurt one of her teeth pretty good on it.  We were not looking for a free meal or anything from it and pointed it out to the waitress who said something like \"Ohh\".  Awesome, we just wanted you to let the kitchen know so that they could be more careful.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future but certainly not for food.  Both the service and the food disappointed me and while I did not order any of their drinks, they have a nice list and I was eying them up and imagine that I could enjoy one in the environment that Social has.",

The canned beer selection was interesting and I found a style of Anderson Valley that I hadn't seen in Pgh before. Bonus!  Pizza was fantastic. I'd rate it up there w/ some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. My wife had the grilled cheese and enjoyed it. It wasn't mind-blowing, but classic and it hit the spot.  Our friend had the cauliflower patties, which we'd tried -- and loved -- at an event earlier. She wasn't disappointed. She happens to be gluten free as well so the availability of a hard cider option was welcome.  The build your own salad options looked cool too and I'm looking forward to trying that out.   Overall, this is a great space. The patio looked cool and possibly a great lunch spot. The noise/distraction level may be a turnoff to some and is the only reason I couldn't go full 5 stars.",

It's pushed up against Penn Ave., and hence is wonderful every five minutes or so when the stop lights line up just right to quell traffic. Otherwise, not so much. There was a strange intermittent smell of sewage as well. Bummer. The inside wasn't appealing as it was ice cold.  On the plus side, the shrimp salad I ordered was made with fresh crisp ingredients and was quite tasty. I also sampled the Thai pizza which comes on an incredibly crispy crust. It was vaguely reminiscent of something you'd get at California Pizza Kitchen. There's also a decent beer list.   Overall, I wasn't terribly impressed, but that wasn't really their fault. The sewage smells while eating don't exactly help a meal. I'll give them another chance in the future and probably sit inside (and bring a jacket).",

I'm not sure if this is my fault for going during lunch during the playoffs for the Pirates or if the place is always so damn loud, but the volume of the television was laughably loud. It became a running joke the entire meal how my friend and I couldn't hear each other across the table because the game was so loud. The place is all metal and wood too, so the acoustics made it even worse.   It was very very busy and there seemed to be tons of later 20 somethings/early 30 somethings there to watch the game. Our server was upbeat and friendly, and the artichoke dip we had to start with was fantastic. I had the shrimp po boy and it was messy and forgettable. My friend got the steak sandwich and instead of coming shaved it came with huge chunks of chewy meat. He said the flavor was good, but the texture was ridiculous.   Overall I'd try this place again on a non-game day because I actually like to enjoy the company I'm with. The branding of this place is so cool and I really really would like it to become a regular spot.",

I have gotten salads both times which are delicious and they even have a create your own salad option. Top that off with the scrumptious ice cream cookie sandwich is a must.

We're not big eaters, so the \"dirty bird\" (a Thai skewer type starter) and Margherita pizza sounded great to share.  The skewers were small, but done well; paired with rice, I ate most of this, glaring at the poor man when he went to reach for another.  The pizza was mostly basil, but we still ate half.  It was better as leftovers the next morning, for sure, but nothing incredible. I think the saddest part was how boring our bevvies were. Delicious, but too simple.  The wolfhound is my kind of sweet + vodka (with elderflower, of course) dream, but at the crafty cocktail price, no.  Overall, the service this night was great, and we decided overall we could come here again.  It would work well for groups with pissy, picky eaters (me!).  Unfortunately, the next time I was here, not so lucky.  A girlfriend and I were out for drinks and wanted a little munchies.  Upon arriving, we were carded at the door by some random, unmarked man just hanging out.  There weren't any servers or hosts, so we figured bar only, fine.  The crowd was horrific.  Kids that looked not old enough to be there seated around the packed bar with rowdy older couples .. The whole thing was not my style. We were finally given drink menus without a word.  Kitchen must be closed? Fine again.  We ordered our drinks about ten minutes later when she chose to acknowledge us, two prosecco cosmos.  They arrived, frothy and low in the glass.  There is no nice way to say it, but they were soapy, almost a pear shampoo (use your imagination).  We laid our $25 on the counter in cash and got out of there.  Silver lining, we had our lyft driver drop us off at Aiello's to make up for the horrific time at Social. It was necessary.  Looking for creepy patrons and horrible, boring, overpriced drinks?  This is your spot. Get excited for nonverbal bartenders too.  If you're desperate during the kitchen hours, it's okay.  I wouldn't suggest it, but I'd grudgingly tag along.",

Hubby and I were able to sit at the bar, several open tables around.  Nice crowd of people, mostly couples.  Ordered the stuffed peppers--they were delish!  Each of us had two drinks, I had a berry mojito for $9, and although I could not taste the alcohol, it was yummy.  Hubby had two Guinesses.  Overall, prices are comparable to what you pay in the rest of the city, bartenders were very friendly, I'm sure we will be back.  I would not say this would be a destination for us (mostly because of the parking in Bakery Square), but it is a nice \"lay-over.\"",

There is plenty of space both inside and out on the patio hangout and relax after work.  I personally like the beer selection which has a variety of craft beers including a local selection with a few of my favorites. They carry Fat Heads and East End regularly. They also have a variety of specialty pizzas, of which I recommend the Green Eggs and Ham.  They also host a corn hole league night through the Pittsburgh Sports League during the summer. It's a great atmosphere and a good time. The location is convienent for those in the east and northern parts of city.  Additionally, my girlfriend has done company happy hours here and the service has always been great. The owner and the staff are friendly and helpful!",

We chose to sit at the bar which was a great choice and the only reason for a two star rating. The bartender was super knowledgeable and really enhanced our visit. However, we waited for our food over 40 minutes and when the Eggs in Hell arrived, that is exactly what they were. The eggs were so over cooked they were inedible. The cheeses were baked on to the bottom of the iron skillet and had to be scrapped off with a knife to eat.  The hot pepper was indiscernible and the sausage had to be cut through the black crust with a knife. Sooooo disappointing.  And I didn't realize there was any marinara as it too was over done. And what! we waited 40 minutes for this!?!  Here is the description of what I thought I was  having for brunch:    EGGS IN HELL- iron skillet filled with sausage stuffed banana peppers, marinara, provolone, mozzarella and two sunny side up eggs with toast and a side of tots.   - Definitely sounded a lot better than what I was presented.   I reiterate that we enjoyed ourselves because that's what we do. Even if the food was disappointing our cocktails were superb. Kudos to the bartender - she and the drinks were the best part of our experience.    We will return for cocktails but not sure if we'll order food again.",

    "text": "Well this used to be my favorite casual restaurant. Three stars because the food & our server was okay, would've been two because of the overall atmosphere being weird and drastically different from how the restaurant first started out. Three years ago when I lived in Shadyside I would come here at least once a month. The atmosphere was fun, the \"Social Workers\" were very personable and cool, and the food really great, especially for a casual place. After moving a little further away I didn't come here as often but would still crave the turkey burger and tots. It had been worth the drive until now. There has been a change in management (per the server, as I had to ask). When we walked to the host stand nobody came around for like a few minutes. When we finally got a table a server didn't come around to take our beverage order for about ten minutes. We had to ask for the fill-in-your-own-salad-order sheet (probably not a big deal but this is kind of their main thing). After that everything was average. Our salads were okay. The server never checked back until we were done with our meals; I could've used more dressing for my salad because the chicken was dry. What was going on around us was bizarre too though. A party of four came in and asked for a specific table to which the host straight up said \"No\". It was not busy (8p on a Sat). There were a ton of open tables. They ended up being able to sit there but not til after a slight argument. Another party of four came in and legit had to wait for a table but what was weird was the host asked to see someone's ID even before they sat down! The guests were totally confused. I hope this experience was a fluke although I don't see myself making a point to come again unless I'm already in the neighborhood. Unfortunate.",

I ordered the grilled shrimp salad and it all tasted great, but was disappointed that the shrimp was iced cold. I understand that this is a salad, but I'd prefer fresh grilled shrimp. Then I asked for extra dressing because the amount of dressing that was given to me did not cover the entire salad. Later did I know that they charged extra for extra dressing, which I thought was ridiculous, as I had never been charged for extra dressing at a dine in restaurant.   My friend had ordered the crab cake sandwich which was $15 bucks, of course we would expect a decent crab cake sandwich. To our surprise, the crab cake was fried and there was barely any crab. Most of all, extremely salty! Very disappointed...  Overall the food is below average and definitely not worth the price tag.",

I have to admit I love the premise but the execution felt as if it was opening night. They just didn't have the finished feel to the recipes and the plating was non existent. I was also underwhelmed fans disappoints from the bitter \"dirty Palmer\" that was really watered down Jack, to the 6 Fritos on a cup of chicken chili that was unremarkable in every way except to say, \" bland heat- right out of a can\", to me. I also took a chance with the \"Satey\",(quotes intentional). I won't hold it against them for offering a pan-palate selection- it's hard to do cafeteria food as shadows of international fare, but at $12 for 2 small chicken breasts dipped in a teriyaki sauce straight out of the local buffet resturant, and a presentation that felt \"lazy\" bs casual, and it aligned with he vibe of he place but just not my expectation given the other superior offers within a mile of the place. Anyways, all In, a cocktail, cup of chili, and two chicken breasts was $30.00. I'm not seeing the value of the experience and won't likely be back. It may work for others who want a convenient place to go if they live in either of the Condos and don't want to pull your car out of the garage.",

I think of Social as more of a place to visit with friends for drinks and appetizers or even for lunch, than a place to visits for dinner. it has such a modern, fun vibe that makes you want to keep drinking and being social. the only downside was the service was a bit slow. our server was so nice and attentive when she was with us, but it took her a while to come to our table. I'm not sure if it was because we were a larger group and she wanted to let us talk or what, but that was really the only minor complaint I had. everything else was great!   some of the things we tried were: jacked Arnold Palmer: not very sweet. has a strong whiskey flavor. I just expected something totally different social punch: dangerous. this stuff is so good!  black bean quesadilla: everyone loved it social sticks: so addicting. the cheese is mixed perfectly on these and the dough is so so good Luis' spicy chicken dip: this is very cheesy, but it's so good. it's very smooth and has the right amount of spice to be appealing to all  fried chicken and waffle sandwich: this was ridiculously yummy! it has a maple aioli which I think was overpowered by the fried chicken, but was really good on it's own. when ordered again I'll get a side of maple syrup for it too  BBQ chicken pizza: my husband said it was \"unreal\"  so many things I want to try... various grilled cheese, pizzas, build your own salad..

Finally an hour later we got a text our table was ready only to discover it was not cleaned off yet. The waiter then proceed to give us water and didn't take our order for another half an hour. The food came and we were then charged extra for asking for more chips for our apps. The waiter was also upset we wanted to split our checks and told us it would probably be another 20 minutes. It was a Thursday night so I understand restaurants can be busy but this was an exception. The food was good but the employees attitude will make me never come back.",

Service was service... A slightly shy server kinda just went through the motions. \"Menza-menza,\" (so-so) as my italian mother would have said.   Server introduced me to the \"build your own salad\" that will most likely be my selection on my next visit. But, since I came for the burger, a burger I ordered. When it came, I asked for Ketchup (one of the reasons I order a burger; a good excuse to dip something in my periodic native craving for heinz ketchup) so the server says, \"it comes with Social sauce on it so you may not want ketchup.\" Poor kid! Must not be from Pittsburgh.   The burger was good. Very, very juicy; borderline too sloppy. Tasty, but the texture bothered me a little. It reminded me of a time I put way too much Adolphs meat tenderizer in my burgers at home.  So, nice taste, a little small for $11 quite honestly. Nice size for lunch.   I'd go back but I would try something else.",

The first time I tried a sandwich which was basically all bread.  The second time I had a BBQ chicken pizza which was overcooked and not well designed to begin with (I could write an entire separate review on what was wrong with it and how to fix it).  The third time, I tried just eating snacks and desserts, both of which were bland.  And last night I had some decent meatball sliders with over-fried and over-salted wings that came with a sickeningly sweet and hard to apply dipping sauce (though to be fair, my excellent waitress did recommend the other sauce, but I wasn't in the mood for it).  Maybe I've just been unlucky.  But the next time my friends want to do dinner and drinks at Social, I'll probably eat somewhere else first and just join them for the drinks part.",

I can't say I have had a consistent experience, some menu items I love, some I hate.  Let's start with the love:  The Buffalo Chicken and Spicy Chipotle Sausage pizzas.  Both are incredibly tasty and made with a thin crust.  Fresh ingredients with a good ratio of cheese to ingredient.  Hate:  the Mushroom Bianca pizza.  It appears that a mushroom \"paste\" is slathered on this pizza.  Just not my thang.  Alcohol - specials are good here!  For example, Sundays they have $5 Bloody Mary's.  Not Pittsburgh's best Bloody, but certainly not the worst, and the price is reasonable.  They also have $2 beer specials and a nice array to choose from.  The service here isn't awful.  In the summer it gets busy and you can sit outside and enjoy the weather.  Actually, in the cooler months they have this patio area covered with heated lamps.  I dig it.  Although, with busy Penn Avenue just a couple feet away it is a little noisy.   I'm just glad there is a decent bar/restaurant, like Social, within walking distance from my house.  Because parking at Bakery Square just aint fun.",

    "text": "Had a great night at social yesterday. I was leaving east end food co-op in east lib and I was looking for a very good salad.  I had only been here once almost two years ago after a yelp event but never ate their food. We were seated right away and ordered out drinks. I was driving so I ordered a virgin margarita. It was so delicious and somehow carbonated but extremely tasty, not overly sweet with a sugar rim.   For our entrees we ordered two salads and a turkey burger with the tomato soup. My salad was the grilled shrimp one with a hard boiled egg. It came with the lime vinaigrette but their southwest dressing was way better. My hubby ordered the southwest salad complete with black beans, corn, warm chicken and avocado.  First off even without dressing my salad was great! The feta cheese alone was so flavorful that each bite tasted greAt!! The shrimp had that great grilled flavor and was nice and juicy. Instead of tossing the salad in the dressing I decided to just dip it in the dressing to save on calories. This worked really well because I only needed half the dressing for the entire salad.  My husband really enjoyed his salad as well, the warm chicken tasted so good with the cold lettuce cheese and onions. Onions always make a salad taste great!!  We split a turkey burger and tomato soup which I was surprised how well it tasted. The turkey burger was plump and juicy not dry, accompanied with sweet mango salsa and Gouda cheese. Very simple burger yet very delicious. The tomato soup is probably the second best I've ever had which will definitely make me come back for more. I was never a huge tomato soup person but this place hit the nail on the head for me. It had some nice texture to it unlike the Campbell's that's basically red water in a can.   Food, drinks, atmosphere where all great. The noise level was acceptable, music was good but the lights were a little too low, even for me and I have good eyes.  I will definitely be back soon!",

Their drink menu was extensive with micro brews and local brews. I chose the ever popular Iron City. After perusing their menu and seeing some of their pizza come out of their kitchen, we both chose pizza. They have two sizes, 12\" and 16\". We both chose the 12\", ordering a pepperoni and a veggie pizza. Neither one of us could finish our respective pizzas. We were seated promptly, served quickly and our server checked on us several times. We had an excellent experience here and will most likely return.",

We live at Bakery Living just across the street, so it's great having a solid restaurant outside of the basic chain options (Panera, Jimmy John's, etc.).  As many people have mentioned, they have a nice range of drink specials, depending on the day of the week. As far as the food goes, the pizza is excellent. Very nice bubbly crust that's soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. The Mushroom Bianchi is a little too strong on the truffle flavor for our tastes, but the pepperoni, margarita, and BBQ chicken are favorites.   You also can't go wrong with one of their big salads. Ask for Blackened Chicken instead of Mahi Mahi on the salad that comes with jalapeno lime dressing. You won't be disappointed.   The quality of service can vary a lot based on the day and luck of the draw, but overall we've been very pleased with this place and give it a strong recommendation to anyone looking for a nice, casual place with a tasty variety of menu options and good drink specials.",

Showed up with five people on a Saturday night and was seated without a wait at 8 p.m. We sat outside on the patio and it was quieter than it looked around the bar.  Menu is extensive and everything sounded delicious. Confirm what another Yelper said about the portions being huge. They are H-U-G-E. I ordered the cobb salad with chicken and it was packed with flavor. Avacados, chicken, eggs, simply delish. Got the nachos as an app and also falling off the plate- great for a group to share with a little extra kick to them. Washed it down with a Shipyard pumpkin beer to cancel out the salad. Shh, don't tell.  The menu is a fusion of basics with a twist. I was eying up the sandwich selection (peanut butter, honey and bacon grilled samdwich) and was between a few entrees. Beers on tap, too! Felt like I was getting tasty food and lots of it for a fair price.  I'm looking forward to coming back from 4-6 to try the Happy Hour... rumors of $5 apps. There's also a daily special like half off mimosas or half price wine so take advantage of those, too!",

The cocktails are made with fresh fruit, and Social offers a nice variety of craft beers in the can and on draft.  My fav drink so far is the margarita, and my fav special is BOGO cocktails on Tuesdays (you can mix and match).  The food is OK - for me, it's there to soak up all the alcohol I enjoy at Social.  It's not bad, it's just....average.  They offer the option to build your own salad, with a notepad on your table to do just that.  Be careful, all those extras...they are going to add up and you may have one pricey salad!  When the weather agrees, enjoy the large seating area outside.  You can park in the spots in front of Social, but it can be difficult to find a spot - you are better off parking in the free garage.  Social filled a void in Bakery Square, as there was not a full-service restaurant located there for years.  I've read some complaints about the sparse, industrial decor, but I kind of like it.  The large bar is the feature of Social, and the drinks are their best asset.",

    "text": "Wow, people were right about the smell outside.  I really hope that if you do come here, you take a seat inside.  I hope that they figure a way to overcome the storm drain right next to the patio area, it's unsettling.  Asides from the smell, the atmosphere is, um, how do I put this, uppity.  I felt like I was looked down upon by the other patrons.  Really, you're in East Liberty, a block away from Larimer and Homewood.  So what, you're in the same building as Google, that doesn't make you any better than me.  Now, to the food.  The most amazing part of this place.  My favorite was the kale and artichoke dip.  The chunks of artichoke were so big, so tasty, that it made me forget the other things.    The service here too was well above average.  Very nice, and very happy.  Knowledgeable about the menu and able to answer all my questions.    A return visit here would definite have to be one where I sit inside and go at a different time in the day.",

    "text": "Social is a hip, informal restaurant located in a newly revitalized area. Food is good for the price, but the service leaves much to be desired.  Every time I go to this establishment, I order a pizza but ask that one half contain no cheese. However, the staff is often confused by this request, and I end up having to send the pizza back and wait for them to fix their mistakes.    During my last visit, we had two different waiters that didn't know the other was taking care of us already. We had to point this out to them, and the restaurant was not busy at all. Not sure how this confusion occurs so often.   I keep coming back because the food is incredibly delicious and the drink specials are great. I just wish that they could get the staff trained properly.",
