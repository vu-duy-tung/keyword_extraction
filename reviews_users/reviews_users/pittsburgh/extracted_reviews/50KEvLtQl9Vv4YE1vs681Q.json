    "text": "This is quickly becoming a favorite restaurant of mine.  The food is delicious, the prices are great, and it ends up being a crowd pleaser in my family especially when there is quite a bit of indecision on what to eat.    I've been here a few times and here's what I've had so far:  - Thai Toast - pretty good shrimp toast with a little more spicy kick than you would normally get at a Chinese restaurant. - Thai Dumplings - OK considering they're probably frozen. - Roast Duck Noodle Soup - rich broth that isn't as salty as I've had in other places - a great dish. - Pad Thai - I've ordered it with chicken and tofu. There's a slight upcharge for the chicken and tofu. But, it's worth it! Chicken is very tender and flavorful. The tofu is firm and holds up even in leftovers the next day. I order it spicy and ask for Thai Peppers on the side for some additional kick.",

    "text": "Excellent chicken lettuce wrap with plenty of lettuce for all of the chicken. The Tom ka was some of the best I ever had. Not too creamy just the right amount of sour and spice. Normally I have it with chicken but this was with tofu and it was just as good. The pad thai was good however it could have used a little more sweetness to complement the sourness. Nothing a packet of sugar from the table could not resolve. Plenty of peanuts on the pad thai. The bobba milk tea was excellent and the tapioca balls were cooked just right. It would be nice if they had more private seating and booths instead of a cafeteria like atmosphere. Overall a restaurant food that I would highly recommend",

    "text": "My husband and I love Thai food and eat it whenever we get the chance, so we were excited to try this little locally owned joint out in Robinson by the Market District.  The excitement soon faded.   PROS Quickly greeted and seated by the host. Cost The sauce that comes with the Thai Spring Rolls Tofu is available for some entrees (although the menu doesn't say it)  CONS -Parking lot is swamped @ 6PM on a Saturday night (not Thai foon's fault but still irritating and good to know ahead of time you may have to stalk for a parking space)  -Waitress never brought us water.  -Ordered \"hot tea.\" The first was a cup with a Lipton Black tea bag. The refill was a full pot of green tea.    -The Thai Spring Rolls were flavorless.   -The \"extra-spicy\" Pad Thai and Thai Curry Noodles were mild at best.  -The abundant red and green peppers in the pad thai (this is of course to the personal likes or dislikes of the consumer but as purists, non-traditional vegetables are irritating)  -We waited so long for the server to check in on us and refill the soda that my husband went to the drink fountain and served himself while two employees walked by him. Both looked at him but neither said anything to him.    -The thai ice tea, while not ordered, comes pre-mixed with no clear line between the condensed milk and the thai tea. It was also an odd orange color unlike I've seen before. It just looked bad.  -The only time we got quick service was when payment was due. We were not asked if we wanted desert.  In conclusion, if you like Americanized-Asian food, this will do, but it isn't anything special worth going out of your way to try.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch today and had #29 Spicy Garlic Chili Sauce ($7). The food was very Americanized, but it was quite tasty. I liked all the vegetables provided, except the pea-pods, which is a rarity for me.  I ordered it very spicy, but the spice level received was about 5/10. The portion size should have been a tad larger. The waitress messed up my GF's order: chicken instead of tofu. She took it back and came back nearly 5 minutes later, which pretty much guaranteed to me that they just plucked out the chicken and stuck in the tofu. Some people are probably okay with that. We didn't get one water refill the whole meal.

The service wasn't that great. The food was just okay, but I wouldn't call it Thai food at all. They didn't even have peanut sauce. The Pad Thai was lacking flavor and didn't have any spice. The Crab Rangoon was only okay (my husband loved it, though, so that could be me). When the server brought my phone back after scanning the groupon, there was ink on it. I still can't get the ink off. I want to call, but this might make me a douche bag. I'm not sure...  If you are in the area, skip Thai Foon and head to P. F. Chang's instead.",

    "text": "Great Dollar Menu at Thai Foon - A slice of lime and three strands of Cilantro - More important is the Owner's Attitude towards the Wait Staff.  I used to be a huge fan of Thai Foon until this incident occurred a few weeks ago.  I have ordered the Indonesian Fried Rice for years and it used to come with a lime and cilantro.  Then a few months ago, it did not come with it, so I asked the waitress and she said that some people don't like it so they stopped adding it automatically.  During the next four or five visits, I made sure to ask for the lime and cilantro and they obliged graciously.    This time around, I noticed that they had added $2 for lime and cilantro for 2 orders of Indonesian Fried Rice.   When I asked the waitress, she said that she was just following orders and that she needed her job.  So I asked to speak to the Owner, who flat out told me that they have been charging for lime and cilantro for years.  When I said that was not what I had experienced, he asked me to point to the waitress who had been giving me free lime and cilantro and said, \"Show me the waitress and I will take it out of her paycheck.\".   While I did not care about the charges at this point, I was dismayed with his attitude towards the very people who make his business work.  While I still love the Indonesian Fried Rice and don't mind the extra charge, I don't feel good about supporting such a businessman.",

    "text": "This place is mediocre at best. I was hesitant to go in because they had no customers at a busy time of day, but my wife was in the mood for Thai and I didn't want to drive to the North Side. I also have two coworkers that go to this place at least once a month for dinner. By the time we left, my wife was saying she wished she would have wanted a burger or pizza. The wait staff look and act like they are a bunch of college kids hanging out. We had four different people come to our table. Since we were the only ones there, it was pretty easy to hear the original waitress say to her friend, \"Can you check on my table?\" It seems that she was too busy texting or playing a game on her phone. Now to the food. I ordered Green Curry Chicken, but Green Curry Onions arrived. The sauce was good and I used it to flavor my rice. The waitress came by to see if I wanted my onions boxed up, clearly missing that the bowl was full of onions. My wife ordered vegetable lo mein. Her noodles were way overcooked and the sauce had way too much salt to be edible. We left this dish almost completely untouched after the first couple of bites.  The waitress mentioned that we must not be familiar with authentic Asian food. However, my wife is from Hong Kong (Asian by most standards) and I have spent a enough time in Asia to become a Permanent Resident. If you are in the mood for good Thai food, make the effort to drive to the North Side, Lawrenceville or Highland Park.",

IT has just the right amount of kick and sweetness and the chicken is super tender.  I've tried replicating the dish on my own, but I can't get it so I guess I'll have to keep coming back for more!  Best pad thai I've had also and the spice basil is really good if you're looking for a punch of heat.  Prices are reasonable, although they've increased since they first opened.  I'd rather take out than eat in as the seating arrangements are really odd - you're about 6 inches from the table next to you unless you're in one of the two private booths.  Overall, great eats and flavors.  It'll make any trip up to the cinemark theater a goodie!",

My favorite, which I pretty much stick with, is the spicy basil noodles.  I usually get a side of chili oil so I can adjust the heat.  I like many ethnic foods.  It doesn't have to be perfectly authentic, it just has to taste good to me.  It is a fast turn around at lunch.  It does a brisk business, but usually no wait.  Dinner it is usually much quieter.    It isn't a fancy place, the decor is spartan but modern. You could have a dinner party here, but it isn't really that kind of place.  It is more of a lunch or dinner for 1 to 4 people type place.   It would make a great quick dinner before walking a couple doors down to the theater, but don't forget you will probably order popcorn, so don't pig out.  Give it a try.  It is inexpensive, and I am sure you'll find something you like.",

    "text": "I consider myself a True novice when it comes to Thai food. Read: NO EXPERT. So please take this review with that caveat in mind.  Looking to eat anywhere without reservations at the Settler's Ridge complex on a Friday night can be very frustrating, from the parking issues to the just plain crazy wait times at certain places.  Thai Foon had a table available, and the 3 of us are all fans of (what we consider!) Thai food.  Notes: Seated immediately at 7PM.  BYOB; there is a retail shop for an area winery next door, if needed. I noticed that the restaurant had very nice wine glasses for those who brought a bottle.  Why are many Thai restaurant interiors painted in shades of pumpkin?  Menu was not exclusively Thai by any means.  Service was spotty; I noticed that other tables served by a different waitress got lemon wedges on their water glasses--we did not. Waitresses seem to do all of the busing, and our waitress seemed to not know this.  Our waitress was very obviously new to the restaurant and new to waitressing, so I'm giving her a break. (But she was pretty bad)  Kitchen was slow for our order, people seated after us were eating long before we did; also it was obvious that my H's curry noodle dish was ready well before my & daughter's pad thai. Both pad thai's were steaming hot, husband's was very much not.  Our order: daughter loves Bangkok  Balcony's Thai Iced Tea. She did not like this version. ~Cold edamame-unscrew-upable ~Summer rolls-very fresh tasty, mint leaves inside were nice. Have to admit to never having had one before, but I thought the texture of the wrapper was gluier that I would have expected. Wanted a spoon for the peanut dipping sauce--super good, peanutty and spicy ~1 shrimp, 1 chicken Pad Thai-very nice. Noodles perfect texture, plenty of fresh cilantro (no stems!). Daughter loved the shrimp, I wish I'd gone meatless. Chicken pieces too large and kinda slimy.  High quality take home containers. ~H had curry vermicelli noodle dish with chicken (you can chose protein-chicken, shrimp, beef-for many of their entrees and soups). He enjoyed it all.  I would try the place again, and hope for a more experienced waitress/waiter. The food was plenty fine and very reasonable.  Our bill was in the $30 range!! Can't remember the last time we paid cash at a restaurant :))",

They have a pretty big menu selection of noodles, rice dishes, appetizers, etc. Some of them are more thai inspired items, but you definitely see your Chinese takeout variation of dishes as well.   I have had their curry and found it to be less than stellar with carrots, peppers, and russet potatoes. I prefer sweet potatoes of sorts. I must admit their noodle dishes are pretty good though. I always go with pad Thai when I go to new Thai restaurants and thought it was pretty good. They give you a healthy portion of food for the price - so I think it's a good value for under $10.   They have good service and are quick with getting people in and out. A lot of people come here for their lunch breaks because of it's central location in the Settlers Ridge plaza, so if you want to beat the lunch crowd try to get in before 12 or expect to wait a good 10-15 for a table.",

Six per order. The Pho with chicken was good, though I needed a little soy sauce in the broth. Even with my very little experience with Pho, I thought that a big component to Pho was adding different side items to change the taste, but no side items such as hot sauce, soy sauce or chili's were on the table. It was still good none the less.",

I know lots of people like their Indonesian fried rice too :) you will love this place",

Also, the portion sizes are not bad either. Due to our busy schedules, we have been going here a lot more often for takeout (2-3 times a week, not kidding). Both of us get shrimp pad Thai every single time with only noodle, shrimp, and egg.   Last night, my boyfriend ordered it and I picked it up on my way home. When we went to eat, we saw that our entire order was messed up. This is the first time that this has ever happened, so we weren't too upset. However, noodles are difficult to eat whenever you have to pick through a bunch of extras that you don't like. My boyfriend called and told them the situation on the phone. The woman on the phone said that they would make new ones and to just bring the food back as it came. When we got there, they refused to give us new ones. A man who I believe was the manager yelled out something along the lines of \"I CAN'T DO IT\" out of frustration and walked away. The woman who he spoke to on the phone then proceeded to say that next time we should know what we are ordering. The thing is, there won't be a \"next time\".",

Neither were spicy (our server didn't inquire about our spice preference), and we asked for some hot sauce.  She brought us sriracha and chili paste, but it didn't hold a candle to Nicky's!  I like my Thai SPICY.  My favorite part of my meal was the coconut rice--it was delicious and totally worth the upcharge.    Service was a little slow, but they were pretty packed.  Also, try to avoid sitting by the door--we were COLD!  People kept holding it open, and the restaurant wasn't heated well to begin with.  I don't think I would make a special trip back to eat here, but it's okay Thai if you're in the area.  I did notice it was very family friendly; there were lots of babies and children running about and playing with toys, so if that's something you consider while choosing a dining options this would be a great choice for you!",

I got the wonton noodle soup (which I had been craving and you can't get this everywhere) and that was $11. Portions were decent sized though and we had a little bit of leftovers so that was good.  The taste of the curry was excellent and the fried rice was actually close to what my mom would make and tasted really good. The wonton noodle soup broth was a bit bland and unseasoned though. The noodle they used were the wrong type for traditional yuntun mein dish. They were fine on their own, being eggy and thick but in this particular dish, they should have been the Cantonese thin, yellow, egg noodle. Oh, well, apparently it's a tricky thing to get right. Green Mango couldn't do it either. It did come with 8 yummy wontons and plenty of bakchoy (qing cai). 4/5 overall.   Our waiter Jeff was prompt and got everything pretty quickly. Great service! I hope I get to sit in the domed area next time as that looked cool.",

I usually love getting take out from here during the work week, usually always tasty and I have never had a problem until today.  Today I ordered my usual red curry shrimp with coconut rice and a side of wonton soup.   I have ordered the wonton soup before and they were big noodles. Today it looks like small dumplings with some sort of watered down chicken broth on top of it and it tastes disgusting.   I called the restaurant to make sure I picked up the right soup and they told me yes. I told them the inside of my \"dumplings\" looked raw and the broth didn't taste right. The girl I spoke with told me that the small order has different noodles in it and I told her it wasn't what I expected. After a lengthy conversation with the hostess I was then transferred to a manager. What a joy this man was. He did not introduce him self, answered the phone with \"Hi\" and I had to lead the conversation from there. He talked in circles about noodles and wasn't willing to consider what I had to say. I ended the conversation with telling him it didn't seem like we were getting anywhere and hung up. I wish someone would have offered to do something for me, even replace the soup with a different one or refund me the $5 for the gross one.  This is a busy location with a lot of loyal customers with me being one of them. The hostess was easier to talk to than the manager. I might have to go on strike from Thai Foon for a while. So long coconut rice.",

The place is decent enough, just don't expect the food to be authentic otherwise you will  be disappointed.   Our meal started out great with TOM KHA (with tofu). My hope was high because this soup tasted authentic to me.    Our next dish, the BEEF SALAD, while was good (it's hard to mess up a basic salad) it was very confusing in taste: it didn't have an identity, a problem partly because of the choice of dressings offered. I guess I was expected a salad accented with Thai flavor and didn't get that.   Next, we tried the SPICY SQUID, because I love spicy food. While it was spicy, loaded with jalapenos peppers, it was more of a Chinese dish than Thai, and for $15 I would have liked more than 8 pieces of squid. The rest of the dish was filled with green peppers, onions and jalapeno. The brown rice that came with this was undercooked and not edible. We had to switch it out for steamed white rice.   Our server was decent as was the service.",

Today I got the sauteed mango with shrimp and extra coconut rice. I am so glad this place turn itself around. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep it up.",

The front line staff is incredibly unprofessional. We ordered take out tonight and i decided to use the restroom before we left. I accidentally walked down the aisle between the seating and the kitchen and one of the waitresses very rudely told me to not walk down through that section again (there are no markers indicating no customers) and she acted like I was being the rude one.   Also, within the 5 minutes we were waiting for our food, one of the front staff members were bickering and swearing about a problem with one of the other members of their staff. Keep that stuff in the back or in the kitchen. I would be incredibly irritated if i had children and they hear the staff swearing like that.  Those are only examples of the terrible service we've received at this restaurant. IMO, if you want to eat food from this place, order take out and try to be in there for the least amount of time as possible. I didn't not feel welcome the entire time i was there.",

The very first time I ordered it, the waitress asked me if I wanted to leave out the \"fish sauce\" since she assumed I was vegetarian. I said yes and appreciated the awareness of the waitress. Every time I have ordered there since (at least 20-30x) I have asked without fish sauce, all waiters/waitresses saying yes and noting it on my order. Today I ordered and the man working the front desk said ordering without fish sauce was not possible as it was already made into the sauce. I asked if this meant the last two years if I have been given fish sauce even when it was requested without and he responded with \"yeah, probably.\" It's highly disappointing that a restaurant who tries to market to individuals of all food preferences (especially a tofu meal made for vegetarian/vegan) would be deceptive with their ingredients. I will not return nor recommend any longer.",

You could split a meal between two people and still be full.  The Pad Thai was just okay though. The sauce wasn't the best. A little more flavor would have been better. Plus, it was a little runny and I wished there would have been a tad more veggies.   The bubble tea was a nice perk though. I just went with the traditional black tea and tapioca. I'd definitely pop in to grab one of these, but coming back for dinner, probably not.",

The decor of the restaurant was clean and modern and we were seated in what I would describe as a circular room big enough for 4.  It was an odd place to sit and was probably inconvenient for the server but proved nice enough for us to have a conversation without many distractions.  For my dinner entree I decided to have the Red Curry with Beef, extra spicy.  Like most curries, it came out as two separate plates,  one for the curry and one for the jasmine rice with which it was served.  The presentation of it was nice with the red of the curry going well with the brown of the beef, green and red of the bell peppers and yellow of the pineapple.  In its taste, it was unlike most of the Thai curries that I have had before.  It had a sweetness to it and while being spicy was not exactly what I had been expecting.  Regardless of that it still tasted good and I was more than happy to eat all of it.  When discussing with another dining companion later in the night she also mentioned that her Pad Thai was not exactly what she was expecting either although still tasted good.  We then decided that it was almost like a food court type of Thai food where you know the dishes that they are making but they are not exactly like you are expecting them, yet still tasty.  The bottom line for me is that I enjoyed the food here and it was more than reasonably priced.  I do not know if I would make it a point to come back but it proved to be a quick, affordable and tasty place to eat before a movie.",

Our common go dishes Pad Thai, Fried rice, Curries always taste good. They might go overboard a little with oil and salt occasionally but let me tell you, when I was pregnant I had a very very bad heart burn and yet managed to eat at this place without any issues(this was just an example of how loyal we are towards this place). Yet, today's rude service and (unreasonable)billing led me to share my experience. We were visiting this place after a long while to ge together with our good friends. We were a party of 4 adults and 3 kids of whom 2 were a year and year and a half old and the third one was 4 something. When out order of big soup bowl arrived my husband asked the  person serving us if he could divide the soup into 3 bowls and give us to which his answer was 'this is how we serve it' which I felt was rude. And at the end comes the biggest question that I have, we were given the check and it included 11% service charge top of our actual bill!!!! I am not sure if the kids are counted too because on whole we were 7 in number. My baby is not even an year old how could they charge us the extra 11% service charge ?? And not definitely for the kind of rude service that we were provided.  Thumbs down for today's experience. Once again ppl the food is good but may be we had a bad experience today, but the service charge is ridiculous",

When I asked for my food to be \"as spicy as you can make it,\" they didn't skimp, and brought me some chili paste on to boot, without me even asking!  Much appreciated.  TOM YUM SOUP:  Pretty typical tasting for an Americanized Thai place--flavorful without being very lemongrassy or very soup.  In other words, very palatable, as well as full of mushrooms and tofu.  PHO with BEEF: Came with all the toppings (basil, sprouts, cilantro) already mixed in and lime wedges on the rim.  Flavor wasn't very deep or authentic, which didn't surprise me in the least--good broth is a time investment, not something a lunchtime rush-kind of a joint can just mimic easily--but it was fine as long as your expectations are appropriately tempered.  TL;DR: This place remains a Robinson fixture.  Come here for your Thai fix for a work lunch but don't expect to be wowwed by authenticity.",

Service here is usually quick as almost every time I have come it hasn't been too busy. For whatever reason they have amazing unsweetened iced tea. Kinda weird, but it is really good!   I have tried their creation rangoons and they are OK. Nothing that special. My friend always gets the chicken and string beans that she says are extra delicious! Seems like we both always stick to the same dish!!   I will keep coming here while I'm in the area, and probably will always get my pad Thai!",

The set up inside is really cute with bright walls and they even had a few private little cozy booths towards the front. The service was prompt and accommodating. I went with the usual Chicken Pad Thai and my mom order hers with shrimp. I have dined at many Thai places and I can't say Thai Foon wowed me. My chicken was very dry and tough and it just ruined the entire dish for me. There was something off with the flavor as well. They did give you a rather large portion and I did see a lot of chicken in mine, but I am not a fan of dry chicken so I just ate the noodles. I can't say I would jump at the opportunity to come here again. It's not the worst, but it's not the best either.",

We then got 4 dishes for 5 people: the Pad Thai noodles, Indonesian fried rice, triple delight, and spicy basil chicken (dinner portion as recommended by our waiter). Two of the dishes came with rice and we chose brown rice.  I liked everything. The flavored of the Pad Thai noodles (slightly sweet) complimented the Indonesian rice (slightly salty). I liked the brown sauce with the triple delight which is a good dish for a crowd since it contains a lot of different things. The spicy dish was mildly spicy;. Both the triple Delight and the spicy basil chicken had broccoli and I liked how crunchy it was as well as the bite size pieces.. Service was attentive and he offered suggestions. Drinks were constantly refilled. We were offered chop sticks.  I would come back here again.",

It was made differently from the way I've seen the dish typically. For instance, it has skinny flat noodles, as opposed to the typical wide noodles, it had tomatoes in it, and 4/5 was not very hot. I wanted to order the Tom Kha, but it is pricey and does not include a protein for some reason, so I passed. The space is lofty feeling; has ample seating and parking. Not my first choice for Thai food, but I wouldn't completely rule it out in the future.",

Not a good name for a restaurant.  Anyways, the decore is bland and ugly as well as the food.  My dish was overly saturated with sauce and the vegetables were not fresh.  My date had the spicey basil dish and it gave her a stomach ache(not unlike another reveiwer Alisha's experience).  There was 8 large slices of jalapeno on the plate, which I have never seen before on a spicey basil dish.  You could tell the rice was not made fresh as well.  Everything is pre-made and horrible.  I think maybe I should give this place a lower score than I was originally going to give it.  Why?  Because it is sad that restaurants try to get by with minimal effort by producing an inferior product, especially when they have a capable wait staff.  When you cut so many corners by using frozen food, or not making things fresh it is just a disaster.  Some say it could be considered a natural disaster, or in this case a Thai Foon.",

She didn't stop by once to check how our food was. I drank all my water and had to flag her down to get more. She grabbed my glass and scowled and then disappeared. When I finally saw her again, reminded her about my water. She brought it back and didn't apologize for the delay or anything.  We had to ask her for take out containers and she only brought out two when there were clearly four of us with leftovers. We ended up asking another waiter for the additional take out containers. Then our party got the checks and my friend's soup ended up on mine. We pointed this out and she took them back to correct them. Again, no apologies, she just dropped them back at the table without waiting two seconds for us to put our cards in the check.   Everyone has bad days, but she was exceptionally rude and unfriendly. Waitressing does not seem to be her forte.",

I go here a lot for lunch, so that's why I guess the bubble tea is never ready since they don't open until 11 or 12, I don't remember. Nevertheless, I will keep coming back, I just hope they get it together earlier for bubble tea.",

You would think that famous known spots like Nicky's Thai Kitchen or Smiling Banana Leaf or a place called Thai Cuisine could serve decent Pad Thai or Pad See Ew, curries, etc.  I have struck out everywhere I went of course except for Thai Foon.  Thai Foon is located in Robinson Township not too far from the airport.  Though on a couple of visits they had a few \"off days\", overall their dishes were flavorful and reasonably priced.  I typically like to order:  Crab Rangoons- light crunch and not too thick or oily  Drunken Noodles - I always ask them to substitute the thick rice noodle they ise for Pad Se Ew since that is the CORRECT noodle to use for this entree.    Fried rice - most times good but a few times too much salt or soy sauce added  Panang or Red Curry - rich and great over rice.  Jap Chap - delicious glass noodles that really is a Korean favorite called Jap Chae.  Keep Thai Foon in mind for your Thai craving.",

    "text": "Seriously one of the worst Thai restaurants I have ever been in this country. Whenever I travel and visit new cities, I visit a Thai restaurant (I crave Thai food more when I travel!). I was visiting a friend near Pittsburg and we were looking for a place to eat near the airport. This looked cute and clean from outside, so we decided to go in. The menu looked ok (although there were many non Thai  items such as triple delight, which is a Chinese item). The appetizers (Thai toast and spring rolls) were ok..but the spring rolls were more Chinese-y than Thai. The toast was better , but not the beautiful shrimp and pork paste on toasts that you get from a really good Thai restaurant. Then came out main dishes-Lemongrass stirfry with you and Chile stirfry with chicken. They were not Thai at all! They were both like gooey Chinese buffet dishes. Thai stir fry dishes are never gooey or starchy, or too sweet without much definition of flavors. I could taste a bit of lemongrass, but there was so much sweet and strangely flavored sauce on that I could not enjoy it at all. Broccoli was cooked well, and the the chile stirfry was a bit better (closer to what it's supposed to be) , but I just couldn't believe how bad it was. Usually Thai food does not fail like this. Maybe I should have known that it was a \"fusion\" place. Service was good, food was prompt, and it's clean.. hence the 2 stars, not one.",

I have somewhat of a bias for Asian restaurants because I'm Asian myself and I want to see them succeed. But my most recent visit turned me off so much that I felt I had to let people know.   So the food just didn't taste right. Spring rolls were ok. The Tom Kha soup was a disaster; it was coconut milk with a layer of chili oil on top. There wasn't anything in it except a few pieces of over cooked mushroom and onions. The Pad See Yew had no flavor whatsoever, which it should at least have a soy sauce taste. The Pad Thai had a burnt flavor but it didn't taste natural. My husband compared it to eating burnt plastic.   Thai Foon never was my favorite Thai restaurant but after this disappointing visit, I can't bring myself to ever come back.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch.  Ordered their appetizer of summer rolls and their Thai noodle soup with tofu.  Total was under $20 (without tip).  What's Hot - Quality.  My summer rolls were delish.  Good pieces of shrimp, veggies, and vermicelli noodles.  Their peanut dipping sauce also had a slight spicy kick to it, which was nice.  My Thai noodle soup was also a bit spicy, which added more to the flavor. - Portions.  My Thai noodle soup had a good amount of noodles, broth, and tofu.  It looks like about 1/2 a block of firm tofu, which was nice.  I love tofu, so that they didn't skimp on that was good.  The summer rolls have a generous amount of filling in it, as well. - Location.  It's in a convenient location near a movie theatre, other shops and restaurants, and a Giant Eagle.  It doesn't look like it's hard to find parking either, which is nice. - Layout.  It's nicely laid out with booths and tables.   - Service.  Up until the end when we paid our bill, the wait staff were polite and attentive in checking in on us.    What's Not - Asian fusion.  This place isn't really just Thai food.  It's a combination/fusion of Thai, Vietnamese, and some Chinese.  For example, their summer rolls and Pho are really Vietnamese.  Having had authentic ethnic cuisines, I'm not a fan of restaurants labeling themselves a particular ethnic cuisine, but really being a fusion.  It gets confusing and somewhat misrepresentative.  That also means you find items on the menu that aren't really part of that ethnic cuisine.   - Quality.  There were barely any veggies in my soup, which was disappointing.  There were slivers of bamboo, carrots and bak choy (I think it was bak choy).  Good Asian noodle soups always have a good amount of veggies.  Veggies take on the flavor of the broth, which adds to it.  This didn't have it. - Service.  Be aware, this place doesn't have chopsticks already on the table.  You have to ask for them.  Once we paid our tab, we stuck around and chatted a bit.  However, the wait staff left us alone and did not check in on us.  I've been to other restaurants where the wait staff will check in on you and at least refill our water glasses.  To me, that's the mark of good service.  Final Answer This place rates between 3 to 4 stars.  It's not bad, but it doesn't stick out.  I've had better.  Willing to come back, but may not be a first choice.",

I like to stick with the Chinese food options better than venturing into the Thai options. Their General tso chicken is pretty tasty, and their coconut rice compliments it sooo nicely.   I tried the pad Thai today, and it was alright. I'm a die hard Thai food lover, so I always have some high expectations set in my mind for certain dishes, especially pad Thai. Mine today was pretty oily, so I'll definitely just be sticking with what's familiar for now on. The crab Rangoons aren't that fantastic either, but they fill the craving.   Prices are pretty general for Chinese food around $9-15 per meal. Like I said, I only stop here if I don't feel like going out of my way to a better Asian restaurant, so it's not really anything to write home about in my opinion.",

We started with an appetizer of edamame which were a little over cooked and under salted. I ordered pad Thai and not being a big fan of spice, I got just a level one. Unfortunately, that had almost no spice so I would recommend leveling up for a little more flavor. My friend ordered the fried rice and she loved it. The portions were super generous and priced extremely reasonably. I also loved the selection of hot and iced teas.   Newly renovated, this is a great spot to check out if you in the Settlers Ridge plaza!",

For my meal I got the Thai chicken salad with ginger dressing.  There was nothing Thai about it, as expected, but it was large and had fresh ingredients.  Overall it was a good lunch.",

I usually travel to this area at least one week every year, and today I was hoping to find a good Thai place that was conveniently located near my hotel.  A search on Yelp brought up Thai Foon, and I decided to give it a try.  The dining room was nice and service was really good.  I ordered General Tso's with tofu, and it was absolutely one of the best Thai dishes I have ever had.  The sauce was delicious, unique and not too sweet.  The deep fried tofu was delicious and abundant.  I love tofu and it was way more than I could eat.  More than half of my meal went into a take out container.  My coworker ordered drunken noodles with chicken and she was very pleased with her food as well.  She also order the hot and sour soup, and we both had summer rolls.  Everything was truly excellent.  Servings are huge, prices are very reasonable.  Definitely I will return here soon.  .",

There was also a giant hair in our pad Thai but I was grateful to just return it anyway and get my money back and get out of here ASAP. I guess this place makes money cause it's near a movie theatre but... ya trailer park \"Thai\" food. Like why why why I'd given a choice would you spend money here versus anywhere else?",

As others have mentioned, the wait staff is lacking.  If you ask specific questions about the dishes you will not get an informed answer.  Also, the lack of attention to their customers is obvious.  Often times you are tracking down your server for refills, the check, etc.  However, this seems to be the standard for all restaurants lately.

I got the Tom Kha soup and the spicy Basil noodle with beef. I really love Tom Kha soup and there is only one place that constantly blows me out of the water with it so it's hard to change my mind. This Tom Kha soup was okay. It has good flavor but not the best. Lots of onion, though, which is good and there was a good amount of tofu.   The spicy basil was pretty spicy and they leave whole jalapenos in it. The beef was not that good, though. Unfortunately, this dish gave me a stomach ache. I've had a lot better Thai basil dishes.   The service was fine, though. Nice people who work there. I most likely will never come back to this place, though. I know a lot of other better Thai places and one that don't have dishes that upset my stomach.",

The Thai Salad is bland and like something you could get from Panera, the pieces of chow mein noodles made it taste inauthentic to me. I've had authentic Thai salads many times before, and the balance of sour-spicy-sweet is just not present in this salad. However, the pad Thai is a good gauge for a Thai restaurant, and the pad Thai here was pretty good and the spice level was definitely on point. Unlike some places, Thai Foon will bring the heat if you ask for it, and for that they get 4 stars.",

I had to stop! I ordered the Pad See You (more commonly spelled Ew), which is a wide noodle, with bean sprouts, broccoli, scallions with your choice of meat. I ordered it with beef. Also ordered some jasmine rice. Although my bill set me back $12 (a bit pricey, especially nearly $3 for white rice), the order was large and delicious with a kick of spice. The rice was perfectly sticky. Service was excellent as my waiter came over at least a half dozen times. Will definitely come back, but given it was a Saturday I think the pricing needs to be a bit more competitive compared to all the other restaurants in the Giant Eagle district (about $1-$2 too high for most items). For those of you with dates, they have two \"date booths\" which look like futuristic Jetson-esque rooms built into the corners of the dining area. GREAT idea. They also have a large selection of Boba Tea and several Chinese options as well.",

Their food is not consistent, but when its good - it's really good. Funny thing - I haven't actually liked their Thai food. The best thing they have on the menu is their version of a Korean specialty, Jap-chae. They call it Jap-chap - I have no idea why. Its sweet potato (glass noodles) with eggs, veggies and your choice of meat. It's miles apart from real Jap-chae but it's got unique flavor of it's own. The soft glass noodles paired with crisp vegetables and egg are infused with a smoky well spiced garlic and soy based sauce. Any meat including tofu goes great with the dish.  Another item that scores high on \"yumm\" factor is their coconut rice.  Steven got the red curry and the coconut rice was a fabulous complement to it.   This is definitely not the best Thai place in town but its got some goodies if your taste buds like exploring. Just don't expect fine dining! :)",

Their food is okay at best, not very authentic and not that tasty.   The reason for the bad review is the poor service. I drove about 15 minutes to pick up takeout from this place. Got my take-out and drove 15 minutes back. Opened the food and realized that they screwed up the order big time. So I called and let them know and after being very confused about what to do got the manager on the phone who helped us out correctly. But not after trying to get me to drive back there again to pick up the correct order. But they said stop back and they will give us a gift card to compensate. However, when we returned the next day for the gift card they knew nothing of the sort. The owner was there and argued tooth and nail with us over the gift card, even called the manager who promised it at home to confirm. Then tried to give us a $10 gift card for a $30 dollar meal that they screwed up. Instead they end up giving us half of the cash in return.  I can't see why any business wouldn't want to keep a customer happy. I had gotten takeout from there several times because it was the closest Thai place to my house. I would rather travel to Thailand for takeout now rather than give this business my money. They lost me for good...",

There's no such thing in the US.  Most people I know would run screaming out of the kitchen of most traditional restaurants in Bangkok. Trust me.  Then...cut me a break. Dude. lol  I've eaten Thai food from all over the world and this compares favorably with 80% of the Thai restaurants I've eaten in.  Their dishes have the \"kick\" they should. Their curries are sweet when they should be, sharp when they need to be.  Is their chef going to win awards?  No, but then again, most chefs would be satisfied if the majority of people in the restaurant love what they're eating.  Basil noodles are very good. Their soups are interesting and flavorful, but not over the top!  If you like Thai food, try it.",

You only make yourself look ridiculous -- rather than \"in the know\" or \"like a sophisticated foodie\" -- if you complain about how some dish at Thai Foon is not made the authentic Thai way. Seriously.    Dude. It's a place in a strip mall. Called THAI FOON. Painted orange inside. With no Thai people eating or working there. With a glossy menu and stuff like crab rangoons. Dude. How can you come here and expect traditional Thai fine dining? Are you the guy who calls the Top 40 station and requests Sigur Ros? Dude. No.   It's Thai-inspired. And it's damn good. The noodle dishes are a bit like fried spaghetti. The soups are like Campbell with a kick. Nothing bland here, and if you just close your eyes and imagine we are now eating the cuisine of a country called Thaifoonia, you'll love it too. I promise.  Prices are reasonable. Service is typical for high school kids who have no financial stake in the business. Decor is like McDonalds turned up a notch.  Bask in it.",

The crab rangoon was okay - probably the best of the three, but by no means something I'd come back for.  The only worse crab rangoon I've had was from Sushi Boat, 2 days ago.  ((It's been a bad weekend for me, if judging only by the quality of my crab rangoon.))  The wonton wrapper was crispy, so that's a plus...?     I only had one bit of the pad see yew - it was my husbands - but both he and I didn't really enjoy it.  There was just no flavor.  I can't really elaborate on more, though, since I had only one bite.    The tom kha.  It's by far my favorite soup.  I get it every chance I get.  But this had several drawbacks.  1) tomatoes? Since when are there tomatoes in tom kha?  2) tofu.  Okay, but I wish it had been chicken. I wasn't even asked.  3) there were little slivers of lemongrass that were un-chewable and kept getting stuck in my teeth.  Yuck.   The taste wasn't quite right - it was basically there, but I think it was missing creaminess - it seemed more a tomato/chicken broth base than a coconut milk/chicken broth base.    An okay atmosphere, but I'm used to the quaint coziness of most thai places (e.g. bangkok balcony, thai cuisine, smiling banana)...this wasn't quite the same.    I'm glad I tried it, but likely won't be returning.",

Recently I was staying in the Robinson township area - close to the airport and discovered Thai Foon. The shopping area in which Thai Foon is located, is very new with several restaurants, a movie theater and shopping. It was a nice surprise directly across from my hotel (Hampden Inn). I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants so am always on the lookout for something original. Thai Foon fit the bill on this trip. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it had very good flavor and was quite spicy, which I like. The chicken was tender and everything was fresh and delivered to my table hot. I also enjoyed the Thai Iced Tea. It wasn't as sickeningly sweet as some other version of Thai Iced Tea - it was still plenty sweet, but didn't taste like dessert. All in all, I really liked the variety of items on the menu and the choices that I made. I will definitely return on my next trip to PA and try some of the other specialties.",

Maybe the novelty wore off for me, but I am glad it pleases my palette again! The vegetables are fresh, and I particularly like the green curry. I wouldn't say it is authentic Thai, but it is flavorful and delicious nonetheless. The atmosphere is relaxing, especially at lunch when it is quieter. The dinner prices have raised significantly over the last few years, but the lunch menu is very reasonable.",

On occasion it can be a bit slow depending on who the server of the day is. But I can almost always get in and out, and back to work in a lunch hour. Even on a Friday. I've never ate there with someone who didn't enjoy what they ordered. Food seems fresh and I keep going back for more.  I tried a few Thai places in San Francisco, and this place of course is Americanized. You're in Pittsburgh, what do you expect? It is worth a visit!",

I told her it was chicken but she insisted it was tofu, only when she took it back to the kitchen did she come back and say they got it wrong. I ordered a stir fry udon with chicken, she got me  stir fry chicken with a side of rice. I told her i ordered a noodle dish, she kept saying it was the correct order. Asked her to get the menu n she said \"ohh ok, its the same thing. Do you want me to get noodles?\" \"Its the same thing. Il get u noodles on the side\". I told her i ordered a noodle dish because i wanted noodles, and the dish is to be stir fried with noodles not served on the side. What followed were ugly and angry stares from the chef in the kitchen, the manager n all the servers before i got my dish.   Not once did she come back to ask if everything was ok.  Please train ur servers Thai Foon!",

Aside from fish I don't eat animals, and I love how you can choose your meat, shrimp or tofu option for many of their dishes.  We split an order of the yellow curry (tofu) and General Tso's Tofu.  The yellow curry is a sweet coconut curry (I've had the red curry before and it is equally as sweet) and it's pretty good.  My husband polished off the General Tso's and practically licked the bowl clean.    Our waitress was prompt and attentive.  Our food arrived quickly, but that was not surprising as we were the only diners.  The dining room has slick, modern decor.  There is a window which enables you to see and hear the cooks who were speaking Spanish.  Latino cooks in a Thai restaurant? Talk about diversity!  Ok, so it's definitely not the most authentic Thai food you will find in Pittsburgh, but it works in a pinch on a weeknight when you live on the other side of town from Nicky's Thai Kitchen.  It's BYOB, so you can pop over to the Winery at Wilcox next door and grab a bottle of wine to take with you.",

We got the pad kha soup which was honestly the best part of our meals- but at the time we did not know. I ordered the Crispy tofu which was pretty much dry, without flavor except for the salt. Not impressed.   Then came the entree- Pad Thai, a staple at every thai restaurant in America. There was not much taste- the basic ingredients were there but it had no spice and was missing the exotic flavor associated with Thai cuisine- it just tasted like noodles eggs and meat- which was definitely disappointing.   The location was clean but when you look at it in detail seemed a little tacky with wallpaper peeling off the walls. Service was par at best- very nice but not as attentive.   Prices and portions are pretty good.   I will not bring anybody back because this place is a let down. Maybe there are some redeeming entrees but I will not risk  bringing anybody else with me to test it out.",

I didn't mind because I didn't want to have a long wait and Robinson is notoriously busy during that time. The service was a bit stunted, as our server wasn't all that friendly, but it was also helpful because he wasn't interrupting our conversation every five minutes asking if we needed something.   We started off with some Thai iced tea that was served in two huge glasses. We both enjoyed them thoroughly. We had summer rolls that didn't have nearly as much mint or vermicelli noodles as I would have liked, but the cucumber addition was a nice surprise. I had Tom Kha soup that was mega spicy and a nice balance between coconut-y and sour.   For our entrees my partner had the Thai stir fry and I chose the massaman curry. The curry was mega good--rich sauce and juicy pieces of meat just how a curry should be. The veggies weren't too soggy or too crisp, and though they didn't ask us to specify a spice level, it had a nice kick to it. The stir fry was alright and tasted more like just about any stir fry you'd order at a Chinese restaurant, but we both agreed the curry was the better dish.   All said, if I'm ever out this way and in the mood for some Thai food I'd consider coming back for sure.",

    "text": "So yesterday after we got back into town from going to Warren PA we stopped at #ThaiFoon at #SettlersRidge in #Robinson for #dinner. A friend of ours had been there before and said how great their food was so we thought we would give it a try. The food is AMAZING. Their house fried rice is AWESOME. My hubby had #PadThai and my Mom had a #Udon Noodle Bowl. Their chicken broth is OMG good. Now to the bad part...  Our #waitress Alexis (I didn't know her name till we got home and I looked at the check) was terrible. I asked her if they could make my Mom's soup with chicken broth rather than #Miso. She said no and looked confused. I asked her if she could check and she said yes and proceeded to stand there. I had to ask her to do it now before we ordered in case my Mom had to change her order. She came back and said yes they could use chicken instead. When our food came she served my husbands entree over my head instead of walking behind me and serving between us. Thankfully nothing spilled or I would have been in the ER. She rarely came back to check on us and when she did you would have thought we were bothering her. At the end of the meal she brought our check and said I didn't add the second #BubbleTea and that our check would be $4.75 more. I thought to myself well shouldn't you make sure the check is correct BEFORE you leave it but oh well we gave her our credit card and paid for our dinner. When she came back with the check so we could sign it she dropped it off and my Mother was trying to tell her how great everything was but Alexis ignored the fact that my Mother was speaking and ran off. I was unhappy at that point and we didn't leave a tip. Tips are NOT mandatory but if we would have gotten half way decent service then Alexis would have gotten a tip. We signed our check and as we were walking out my Mom stopped and told them Manager how great the chicken broth is EVEN after Alexis not giving a crap. We walked out to our car and I look up and Alexis had came out the back door and confronted us about not leaving a tip. YES you read that correctly. She chased us outside. My husband told her we were not happy with her service and its our right NOT to tip. She stood there for 5 minutes or so arguing with my husband, At this point I was on the phone with the manager letting him know that his server chased us out the back door and all he cared about was the fact we didn't tip. So we went back today and asked for a refund on our meal because of the actions of Alexis and the Owner Teejay got all nasty and told us we were not welcome in his restrauant and told us to get out. So we get kicked out but Alexis gets to keep her job? Not sure how that works since she was in the wrong.   And BEFORE everything thinks that we are crappy people for not tipping please asked Kaddie Cadillac Rogowski or Angelin Marte D'Perdomo if we are bad tippers.  So if you want good food and crappy service and ownership please visit Thai Foon in Robinson or SAVE yourself money and aggravation and eat somewhere else.",

The last few times I've been there I ordered the Pad Thai, which was excellent, but I don't like sticking with the same thing too long. . . it's a character flaw.  So I'd never heard of Shrimp Jap Chap, but that made it intriguing.  The waitress asked me what I wanted and I told her, \"Shrimp Slap Chop\", but she didn't crack a smile and just wrote down \"Shrimp Jap Chap.\"  We waited at our table, which was a round, but somehow too small.  Everyone seemed too far away, and if one of us pulled it close enough the rest were way too far.   A little asian man came over with our food.  He said, \"Shi-sha-sho?\"  \"What?\" I said, confused.  \"Shi-sha-sho?\" Just as quickly, just as unintelligibly.  I turned it over and over in my mind for what seemed like an uncomfortably long time, but for what was, in all actuality maybe a second at most.   \"That's mine,\" I said.  I wasn't positive that it was, but I figured that's just how you said it, if you were from Thailand.  The rest of the table looked quizzically at me.  I looked up.  \"Shrimp Jap Chap. . . shi-sha-sho.\"  I gestured at the bowl of noodles with my fork.  They chuckled.  It was excellent.  We finished and stood to pay at the counter.  The woman there was NOT thai.  She asked me which meal ticket was mine.  I pointed and said, \"Shi-sha-sho!\"  I'd been practicing.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  \"Shrimp Jap Chap\", I sighed, disappointed.  Good lunch.",
