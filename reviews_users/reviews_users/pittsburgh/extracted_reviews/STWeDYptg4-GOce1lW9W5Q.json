The salad bar, for me, was a bright point.  I made a salad out of romaine and it was fresh as were the toppings.    The floor in this place was absolutely filthy.  It's winter so you expect some dirt but there were plenty of food bits lined up along the carpet edge.  It took a long time for tables to get cleared away.  The dishes are all plastic and eating off of them was kind of weird.  Seeing the scratch marks from so many eaters prior to my own visit was a little off-putting.  My 15 year old had been here with her grandparents in the past and she tried to warn us away.  We will listen in the future.",

    "text": "My server was Evan who was very prompt to accommodate mine and my guests needs.  The manager at this Golden Corral (not sure of his name) consistently goes out of his way to make sure that it is an enjoyable experience for the patrons.  He makes sure silverware is filled, food items are being rotated, and stops and says hello to the customers.  All of the servers were very polite and the cook staff was very attentive and friendly.  The food is good and some aspects make this Golden Corral GREAT which is why I would like to commend them.    There was a great selection of menu items: the rolls were pipping hot, the steak was tasty, great selection of veggies at the salad bar and for the hot items (I really enjoyed the brussel sprouts and carrots - yum), the macaronni and cheese was very tasty, and our server went the extra mile to deliver a plate of rotisserie chicken to our table as soon as it was put out.  They do try to monitor the cleanliness at this location and work as fast as they can to bust tables.  Some visits the food is better than others but I always have very tasty, nicely prepared food items to choose from when I go.  The soft serve (especially with fruit), carrot cake, and chocolate cake are REALLY good.  The roast beef with root vegetables (red skin potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions) is also a good go to menu item.    Hands down I can see the care that goes into preparing the items and creating a positive experience at the Monroeville location.  Kudos to the manager, he does an outstanding job and is very sensitive to the needs of the patrons and supportive to his employees.  I am quite impressed with their business demeanor at this Monroeville location (I only go in the evenings or late afternoon).  I do prefer this one to the Golden Corral in Robinson Twp.    The price for the dinner buffet $10.69 per person plus tax and tips.  Soft drinks cost extra.  I was feeling down today but I can always count on that manager being cheerful and the glow of his personality is really duplicated by the staff.  Much thanks...    11/11/12 I went back for brunch.  I wish some of these breakfast/brunch items were on the lunch menu.  The bacon was perfectly cooked (some of the best bacon I have ever eaten), the juice bar (guava, orange, cranberry, and apple) really add alot to the meal experience, the biscuits were sky high, the sliced potatoes (home fries) were excellent, but my favorite were those warm glazed star doughnuts.  The managers and wait staff once again were very attentive at wiping down the tables the selections were plentiful for a brunch outing.  I was glad that they had macaroni and cheese because that just really hit the spot.",

    "text": "We went to the Golden Corral in Monroeville, Pa last week. I was reluctant, because I have been to Golden Corrals before, and wasnt happy, but the rest of my group suggested it, so we went along.   From the moment we sat down, we started noticing things. The floors were filthy, the seats had food all over them, nothing on the table was clean. We walked up to the buffet and TRIED to find some clean silverware, which was nearly impossible. When we went to look at the food, we noticed that hardly any of the food was replenished, and had not been in awhile (EX. the nacho cheese sauce container had clearly not been re-filled, it was hard and dark orange in color), food was messy around each container (nothing was wiped down), food was spilling over into other containers, etc. I attempted to put some chicken on my plate, when I noticed a hair in it. I managed to find a few items that looked \"somewhat\" decent. We ate quickly, it was crowded and someone near us smelled very badly. When the kids in our group went up to get some cotton candy for dessert, we noticed how gross the dessert bar was too. Chocolate (from the chocolate fountain) was EVERYWHERE, cotton candy pieces were strewn all over the sauces for the ice cream...it was disgusting!   Honestly, we couldn^t wait to get out of there. I have never experienced such a filthy dining experience in my life. I was upset that we had wasted money on it. Instead of eating at \"Golden Corral\", it felt like we were eating at \"The Slop Stop\". I am not even usually one to complain, but we seriously all felt nasty when we left the place. I will NEVER return to the Golden Corral restaurant again! This place needs cleaned up, in the worst way!",

The cashier and waitress were very nice, and the waitress repeatedly brought us drink refills and cleared our dirty plates, but I saw other waitresses blocking the traffic of customers by standing around complaining and swearing about other employees. The price per person for the all-you-can-eat buffet was inexpensive, only about $11 each. I liked the fried chicken, green beans, fruit, etc.--basically the foods that are very easy to prepare, but some other foods did not taste good. For example, the meatloaf was very bland. My husband said that he hated all of his food and was hungry after leaving the restaurant. Aside from the mediocre food, another problem with this restaurant is the customers. Some of them looked dirty, one woman let out a phlegmy cough near my plate of food without covering her mouth, etc. The restaurant is so crowded that the customers swarm around and you cannot escape them. I will not return.",

Had to look for clean silverware,  people up your backdoor in line for steak, the salad bar is trashed and many of the crocks are empty, like always,  total chaos at the register, we've only seen the waitress once.  The bathroom?   Gross and no soap, only hand sanitizer.  Seriously, it's a gallon jug with a pump in between the sinks.  How can you'd place not have hand soap! ?!?  Do they have any on the kitchen areas?  I didn't even eat that much and my stomach is in an uproar.   This is the last time.   Ever.    Short edit, 5/1/16:  Haven't been to this location in a long time.  By the looks of the recent reviews nothing has changed.  I've really been wanting to go to GC.  Looks like I won't be today.    This evening (Sunday, Feb 18, 2013) was the most disappointing experience at this location.  To start off with, I understand they were busy.  We stood in line for about a half hour before being seated.  They had one young guy seating people, and he didn't seem all that concerned with getting people seated in a timely manner.  We saw empty tables everywhere while we stood in line.  I watched a manager in a green shirt wandering around, but it appeared he didn't seem to concerned with what was going on.  After we got seated, there was no silverware.  After we got through the food lines some, but not much finally appeared.  There was a young man wandering around bussing tables at the pace of a snail while the line still snaked out the door.  The hot food area in the middle was well stocked, but the salad side wasn't much to be desired. Much of the salad items were empty or almost empty, and the one and only guy I saw working in that area really didn't appear to care.  The ladies room.  This was an experience.  One toilet full of who knows what with a plunger sitting in the middle of the mess.  Another toilet seat covered, and I mean covered in urine.  The rest of the stalls where dirty, but useable.  One paper towel dispenser empty, another full but not working.  Hair all over the sink.  Over flowing trashcan, tampon applicator on the floor.  I can came out and the manager in the green had disappeared, I looked because I was going to inform him about the bathroom.  The rest of the time there I never saw him.  The chocolate fountain had chocolate splashed all over the place, covering everything.  No bowls at the ice cream machine (not to mention almost empty ice cream and chocolate sauce.)  The service was eh, but I understand she was busy.  I think this is my last trip to this restaurant for awhile.",

    "text": "Over $30 for my wife and I to eat here.  I would pay that for a buffet if the food was good, the place was clean, and the atmosphere was decent. Unfortunately none of this was the case.   When we arrived, the employee filling drinks announced she was going on break and just left and the people in line behind us had to wait an extended amount of time until the host actually went into the back and found someone else to pour drinks. A lot of the food was empty on the buffet and at one point there were 11 people standing waiting at least 20 minutes. for 4 or 5 items on one side of the buffet to get refilled.  They advertise \"steak the way you want it\" but all that was available was medium rare and the grill cook just kept yelling for the line to move and whatever you asked for, you got medium rare.  The food that was available was luke warm at best and the bourbon street chicken was cold.  The employees all seemed very angry and did not want bothered.  Did not see a manager anywhere.   Another issue was sorting through plates and silverware to find something clean.  There were food scraps and sauces left in the middle of the stack of plates and silverware.   Finally we decided to get yogurt for dessert, and the machine didn't even work correctly. It gave us soupy milk like yogurt which looked disgusting.   I've visited before and now after the \"re grand opening\" and can't tell if anything even changed. If anything it got worse.",

    "text": "Golden Corral is a franchise buffet, I seen them in Pennsylvania and Kentucky.  They aren't common like McDonalds, but there is definitely a consistent setup.  Now that I've been to some, considering the price paid, they rank from 1 star to 5 stars.  The better ones tend to be in the south imo, more \"southern hospitality\" from the waittresses perhaps.  When they're \"5 star\", it really is a bargain to get some steak and home-made chow.  And it's usually filled to the brim way past 8pm to reflect that.  This is a one star one.  At the other 2 golden corrals I've been in Kentucky, when they seat you, a server promptly brings a stack of clean plates, steaming fresh rolls with honeybutter packets, and ask everyone for their drink selection.  The rest of the night their job is to clear dirty plates away, bring new ones, and refill drinks.    If they're any good, they would earn as good tip from me as any waiter in a normal establishment for this service.  For a business trip I make to Monroeville anually, I've been at this one two years in a row now, thinking the first time was a fluke.  Nope.  The servers just don't give a f**k.  No plates, you get them yourself, which btw are pretty dirty like the washing machine doesn't work quite correctly.  I also never got rolls from their own iniative, the one time I asked, the server went \"oh, yeah\" and got several right from the buffet into a basket with the honeybutter packets.  The rolls looked like they were made days ago, were dented, lacked that glaze, looked like something a bakery would throw away.  My butter packets were even wrong, the server gave me packets smear with ketchup/thick_salsa and then never showed up the rest of the night.  My 2 used plates were never cleared away.  Half the dressings in the salad station were empty and half the ingredient were contaminated with ingredients from neighboring bins.  The rest of the food reflected this lack of care.  At a good golden corral, the workers really hussle and are busy.  Here, the server's attitude is reflected in the rest of the staff.  A big disappointment - I would rate it 0 stars if I could.  It was one of the few times I gave a 0 tip.  Twice in a row 1 year apart.  Even if the food sucked, I tend to tip if the service at least gave one iota of caring for their customer.  They just don't.",

Some of the seating areas are louder that others -- I always take a quick tour of the restaurant to see where there are some empty tables available and what the \"neigbors\" are like.  I enjoy the crowd, as long as the neighbors are not loud.  This is not \"fine dining\" but the food is good home-cooking and the crowd can be fun if you pick your table carefully.  I have usually found the wait staff to be pleasant and efficient.  In all of the GCs that I have been at (in PA, Montana, OH) the wait staff just clean the dirty dishes away and bring coffee on request.  I leave a normal tip.",

My son in the car begging us not to go... Should've listened to him!  I can't even start to explain how unbelievably FILTHY this place is! The tray they give you on the way in to put your drinks on had food on it and was all wet...... Then walk to the dishes to start this friggin nightmare.... Had to go through so many forks and spoons to find one that doesn't have food and nasty on it..... Then to the food bar..... Looking through.... Everything was UNBELIEVABLY FILTHY! Lettuce had food all through it.... Dressing had food like olives and croutons floating on the top, and the dressing was all over the outside of the crocks... On all of them..... Nasty food all through the different crocks that had other foods you put on your salad... Well i decided i would skip the salad and go for the other stuff... So i walked over there....  FILTHY!!!!!!!! Old food that looked like it was sitting there for days.....i saw they just put out some chicken so bolted over there to get something fresh.... Took back to table.... My son brought these old old pancakes over.... They were so old and dried out he couldn't cut it with a fork.. Had to use a knife... He's like ewwww what's that, pointing to something nasty on his pancake...i said it's prob a bug.... He said, dad, did you see the chocolate fountain? I said God no... I won't go near that thing from the last time we were here... He said you gotta look at it....i walked over and it was all dried out.... Dried Chocolate spattered everywhere!!! I mean freaking NASTY!   Wife gets to table and was grossed out because some lady was putting lettuce on her plate with her bare hands!!! Haha... Now it started getting funny because it was one thing after another....i went up again and saw a guy that was working there dump cooked broccoli in the bin and guiding it in with his other hand, that had a freaking band aid on his finger!!! So i get back to the table and tell my family and they are busting up laughing because it's so damned disgusting!!! Ok here's the clincher..... We are all sitting around the table still discussing how Groce this place is, and all of the sudden my son looks over to the carpet and yells... Is that toilet paper???? I looked over and started busting out laughing.... Freaking toilet paper about three feet long just laying in the middle of the floor.... And nobody picking it up!!. People.... DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!!  I said to my wife and son when we were leaving, at least we got some great laughs out of all of this! My son said at least they have a gallon jug of sanitizer here to use!! (It was full to the top as no one was using it!) It was so damned FILTHY it was comical....i felt like i was in an episode of Sanford & Son!!! Freaking awful! Wish i could give it a zero!",

After checking in we head for our table which is hard to find one without dirty dishes on it. The ones that have been supposedly cleaned haven't been wiped off. Once we find one we take our pops and set them down and put a napkin from the filthy holder over our drinks (so that no pest can get to them)  and we head for the food \" using the term lightly \" every one in there is there for the fried chicken,  but there are only a few dried pieces in the tray. How you let  anything run out is a mystery to me. So I walk around to see what else is there, trays are empty, what is left looks dry. Ohh yeah. The dishes are dirty with food on them. It looks like they just ran water on them and brought them back out. I end up eating a couple pieces of sausage and a little corn and that is all. You don't see the server until they see that you are preparing to leave, I guess so that they can collect a tip. My GF always wants to come here but I hate it so I don't tip but she always does. Some people are easily impressed, I guess that's how I got her haha. But anyway, don't waste your money on this place it is not worth it and should be closed down.

    "text": "Please don't go here. It was the absolute worst eating experience I've had in the last 10 years. It starts as soon as you walk in the door. You pay a ridiculous amount of money. My total was over $13 for lunch and a drink. (Instead you can have the much healthier, local-sourced ENP soup and salad buffet as an add-on to multiple $10 entrees plus a drink while your kids eat off the bar for free.) You get a dirty tray that's wet--they say they just washed it; don't believe them. I took a napkin to wipe it down just so it wouldn't be wet, and it made the napkin all dirty.  The disgusting food is laid out in several sections. Gross salad with fattening, wilted toppings, fried things, sauce-covered things, etc. There are 3 vegetables, but you have to have a secret password to eat anything that might be good for you. Items are not exactly \"pure\", e.g., my salsa had a glop of butter dropped into it. Yummy! (All jokes aside: The rotisserie chicken was really good. If you can get $13 worth of that, go for it!) About 1/3 of the items are in the dessert section. There is a chocolate fountain, but that is only to cover the crapiness of the items you dip in it. I tried to eat one of the rice krispie treats without the chocolate, and I nearly choked. Also, the chocolate is luke-warm.   EMT crews are available for heart attacks.  Anyway, thank God I brought \"Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models\" by Gelman & Hill because at least it gave me something positive to say about  my experience today: \"I love how Gelman sees problems from multiple angles and builds flexibility into the models. I can't remember the time I enjoyed reading a textbook!\"   It was this food that made possible for me to finally enjoy a statistics textbook!!!",

    "text": "I'm only giving one star because zero isn't an option.   As with many buffets, it was very very busy and the staff seemed to be unable to keep the in-demand items stocked for the demand.  Several times my wife and I attempted to head up to the buffet to get the items we missed on our last trip only to have rude people cut us off (not the fault of the restaurant, but still kills the atmosphere).    Waitress that we had was attentive and ensured our drinks were always filled, which was the ONLY plus for the visit.   After leaving the buffet, my wife and I were hit with food poisoning.  As this was the only meal we had eaten together in several days (I had been out of town on business), this was the only common factor.  We both spent the next two days not eating anything solid (I spend 3 days as I ate more) and taking typical steps to stay hydrated enough to function (we had a 6-month old child at the time that required us to care for him through this illness).    We contacted customer service both via email and by phone.  We received absolutely no response via email and by phone we were told someone would call us back - this didn't happen.    The absolute only thing we were thankful for during our visit was that our son was too young to eat anything from the buffet so that all three of us were not suffering from food poisoning.    When mentioned to my friends, some were surprised to hear this but admitted that they had not visited that specific location.  Others, that had visited that location, relayed similar stories and experiences of not getting any response from Customer Service.    We will absolutely, without any hesitation, not be visiting this chain ever again.",

Because they are very interesting to me, especially the ones that are packed to the brim like this one, and all for only $9.99! Everything you can imagine. There is so much food to try that you can't even get to the desserts.   Also, I am kind of surprised by the dummy down below who expects plates to be handed to him. Its a buffet asswipe, get a clue. However, the one thing I will mention that differed from the one i went to in Florida...you have to seat yourself. Ok, pretty easy right? No, not when its packed. It would be nice if they had peeps keeping tracking of where the open tables are at. Oh but one thing I did like was the self serve bread because there were like 10 different kinds to choose from.

All of the food was terrible last night.  It was all dried out, which I was surprised about, because it wasn't packed, but it was busy enough that they should have been making new stuff.  They must have made it all earlier and kept it in the warmers or something.    I was going to get a salad, but the lettuce was black.  Not a little bit on the edges, there were big black pieces of lettuce in there.  It was nasty.  Nice to see how much the workers care about the food they're putting out.  This place has always been the worst for little kids.  There are always a million kids running around, not paying attention to anyone, messing up the buffet.  Last night, there were a bunch of kids over at the chocolate waterfall putting food in it, taking bites of the food, then putting the food back into the waterfall.  That was super nasty.  I told my wife I was never coming here again, and she said that's what I said the last time we were there, but I guess I forgot just how bad it was.   Plus the place isn't really cheap.  With 2 buffets, and 1 drink, it was $26.  You can eat at most other chains and get better food for that price.",

The service itself was good and drinks were refilled quickly without needing to be asked.  The food left much to be desired.  Most of the stations were dried up and had hard crusty food on it from the last refill.  Some of the employees did not have gloves on handling the food.  2 of our party had to get to the restroom quickly before even leaving.  Upon arriving at home 3 of our group became fairly sick including vomiting, stomach aches, diarreah and just a nice feeling of malaise.  Would not return for free.",

They never restocked the burgers even though there were plenty ready on the grille. The roast beef was kind of gross and the one dish... bourbon chicken...

We also decided that we would eat like gluttons and if we were, we didn't want to spend a ton of money.  And yes, my friends, we know when you sacrifice price, the quality of food isn't going to be top notch.  So what, who cares.  We arrive, we pay, we sit, we devour.  Halfway through our time there, and about my third plate in, I decided to venture over the station that is situated right in front of the door.  I look at the register and notice a large party waiting to be seated.  I become puzzled at how they are dressed.  Suits and dresses, much too dressy for such an establishment.  I think about it for a minute and ponder that maybe they came from a funeral, being that it was a Thursday.  I go back to my table with my plate of food and tell my colleague what I had seen and we don't really think much of it until we see the bride and groom.  o_O  Not what you usually see in a chain buffet restaurant or for a regular Thursday for that matter.  These two were dressed to the nines, full train and veil and him in a white tux.  And this wasn't a small wedding party either.  I suppose they were housed in what could be considered their banquet room, fancy.  I mean how much do you love your bride if you decide to hold your wedding reception at a Golden Corral?  Asides from that delightful tale, I doubt that I will return.  Some of the people preparing the food kind of scared me.  They all had summer teeth.",

The food itself was less than appetizing, dried out and stale.  We love Golden Corral in Wilmington, NC, Williamsburg, VA, and several others, but this location is just beyond terrible.  I waited while the guy served ribs to a customer in front of me and then instead of serving me he walked away.  I waited and finally grabbed the serving tool and served myself.  He then returned, took the serving utensil, placed it out of my reach (along with the utensils for the ham) and walked away like he was angry without even asking if I wanted anything else (this was the chubby guy with a beard).  Most of the food on the buffet was pretty picked over (it was 7:30pm) so we grabbed what we could and left.  A waste of $28.11.   The one bright spot was Erica, our server.  She was very attentive and quite pleasant.  The other reviews and pictures here really say it all.  Management and ownership in this location should be ashamed of the product they produce.  F-",

Which was absolutely delicious! The rolls, meatloaf, and Sesame chicken tasted fantastic. And, don't even get me started on the brownies. The bottomless pit in my stomach is satisfied, for now.  So 10/10 I will absolutely be back to the corral of golden standards.",

Eh. The best part about the whole place was the salad bar, and the fact that I was able to get some cotton candy on the way out. Other than that, the actual meal was a joke. On top of that it was over $30 for a joke of an experience.  My girlfriend and I only went here to try something new, they had balloons and signs saying grand reopening or something along those lines. I am not sure if they changed anything, because that was the only time I have been there, but it will also be the last.  Save some time and money, and go somewhere else to eat. (Here's a hint make a left or right at the light, there are tons of options!)",

    "text": "Welp, it wasn't too bad this time. Lucky me, my hubs loves this place. We arrived on a semi-busy Friday to partake in a food frenzy. The lines weren't too long and we were greeted by a professional host who took our order, processed our payment, and served us the cold glass of ice water we'd requested. We grabbed a table and my hubs headed to the buffet first. Upon his return, plate loaded, I headed to the salad bar.  There are a variety of offerings, from spinach to eggs, seafood salad to soups. I then grabbed a few pieces of baked chicken and a yeast roll. When the crowd volumes are high, there is usually a line for the grilled steak, but today wasn't bad. The food was fresh, although the salad bar area could use some refreshing or an attendant to monitor it a bit more. The second round we tried the fried fish, bbq pork ribs, onion rings, fried chicken, all of which were fresh and hot enough. The waiter quickly collected our plates and checked in on us frequently. The dessert round included very moist red velvet cake and brownies which were good. Overall, everything was good, nothing special. They now give you silverware and changed to all white slightly smaller plates, which may cut down on waste.  I gave an extra star for having Heinz on deck! If you want a quick family friendly, economical buffet meal and miss the old Hoss's or Ponderosa buffets of the past, and don't mind the crowd, this buffet will not disappoint.",

But since we were stopping in here on our bus trip, we had no choice but to try it.  To my surprise the food was actually pretty decent. A couple of items on the bar looked like they had sat there a little too long, but the staff quickly replaced them when they saw a large crowd coming. I'm sure the other patrons were glad we came since this happened.  The staff was very friendly and keep our drinks filled and dishes cleared.  So if you are on a bus trip and need to stop, hopefully you will have the same experience. If you come in midday with just a couple of friends, I'm not sure you will be so lucky.",

After moving away from Pittsburgh, I was excited to come back this month and hit up my favorite all-you-can-eat buffet. Since the Golden Corral in Robinson was too long of a distance, we ended up coming here instead.   This Golden Corral has gotten worse since I last came here. The food lacks seasoning and is either under or overcooked. I remember years ago going to GC with friends and one of them said, \"You gotta be a damn fool to come all the  way here just to eat a salad!\" We laughed and nodded in agreement because we thought GC food was the diggity back then. But now? The best thing you can get here is a salad!   Oh yeah, I can't forget the dessert station! Messy with empty trays containing crumbs. The chocolate fountain was turned off and the small amount of chocolate that remained was dried up and appeared parched. It was like a chocolate desert. The chocolate ice cream looks like poo. The sugar free desserts were hardly touched. I saw many people had bypassed the dessert station and got fresh fruit instead.   If you want to come here and be entertained, then by all means come here. I find the food here to be mediocre but different strokes for different folks!",

    "text": "So my first review was deleted several years ago for what was deemed an offensive racial comment pertaining to the clientele at GC.  I find it odd that people often confuse inappropriate comments with truthful comments.  Anyway, I ate at GC last week for the first time in two years.    I must say I was really surprised how they have come up.  First thing I noticed is that they now place silverware with an abundance of napkins on your table.  This is a major step up from the antiquated way at which you had to wrestle people for the last fork, only to find it was still coated in mashed potatoes.  Well, what you thought was mashed potatoes.  This is a major step forward in quality control.    I went early, so the people watching was at an all time low.  Nobody smelled, yelled or shit their pants at their table.  So, that was a major disappointment.    I was there for Prime Rib and Shrimp.  I can honestly say all selections were very good.  The Prime Rib was excellent, breaded shrimp and veggies all done very well.  I don't know how they prepare their cauliflower, but it's always done perfectly.    However, in typical GC fashion there was no cocktail sauce to be found, no serving utensils in some of the chaffing dishes and still stacks of plates with caked on food items which you needed to choose from.    And to add another shock, the carpet was clean.  I'm not sure I have ever been here when the carpet didn't look like a restaurant-wide food fight just occurred.    My server was o.k.  I all needed the entire time was one refill, and she was spot on.  I did notice that the cashier kept herself busy wiping off the food service area and sweeping, which is nice to see.     Even the servers behind the counter were rather pleasant.    This place turns over Managers like Liberty Avenue turns over Johns.  But if they can keep this current guy, I may just return once a month.",

That totally kills any chance of a juicy steak.!!! You might as well grind it up for sloppy joes! Man!... anyhoo, mashed potatoes are amazing, pot roast,and meatloaf are really good too.. but they consistently let things sit on their buffet too long.. you have to ask if they will replace it... so on aspect, they need a person to be in charge of quality control.. if they do that they will get more people in the door... they can save on steak costs if they offer hamburger sliders all day.. it's not rocket science.. especially on Tuesday when they offer 2.99 kids meals.. you want a kid to eat a half eaten slider then hit the chocolate fountain or a half eaten steak?? Also the place needs to hire more help.. always short staffed!! And the bathrooms are consistently horrendous!! You have to expect on a all you can eat buffet that the bathrooms are going to see a lot of action... they need to be checked every half hour by the manager.. there is a manager that has short brown hair and is a slender build that bent over backwards for a special request one time I visited, these are the stories people will tell over and over... you have to say that about the bad aspects of my review.., I've been in food service for 20+ years, I really know the ins and outs of the business... this restaurant can do better , and when they do , the profits will reflect that.. also, be more kid friendly, offer hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches every night , baked beans and apple pie too, you will be surprised how far that will go... a special discount for senior citizens that is above and beyond like a 50% discount.. seniors will be talking about it to everyone!! And make sure you accommodate them when they come... maybe offer a fresh newspaper to the men, and be very friendly and refill their coffee..",

    "text": "Being Easter Sunday and meeting up with my family for early dinner it was my mom's call as to where we were going.  Unfortunately she always wants to go to some buffet for as she puts it \"where there is always something for everyone.\"  This statement is simply not True.  But again her call and I went along with it.  I really have a dislike for almost every buffet place I have ever eaten, especially one that is so cheap, you know the quality goes down with the price.  Over the years I have come to know what BUFFET actually stands for, The B is for bunch, and the E & T are eating together... Message me if you want to know what the UFF stands for:)  So after Easter service we left Mass for the masses of people flocking to the Corral.  I really see no need to rip this place apart, I mean it is what it is.  You can't go here and expect grade A food, it just doesn't work like that for 11.99 a person all you can eat.  The employees for the most part seemed to be hard at work stocking plates, cups, bowls, and whatnot.  There were some waits on things which is ok.  I was disappointed with their steak.  Again I am aware this isn't Morton's or anything but the med rare steaks were more medium well, tough, and 34 of fat encased whatever meat in there that was edible.  I ended up getting three of them because off one you could only get one or two bits then you have to pitch the rest of the fatty beast.  I really liked the mushrooms though, and sadly they were the best part of the meal... Ah maybe that isn't that sad... Again it is what it is.  Clearly this place is great to go if you have a big family on a budget, love to overeat, or just don't care what things taste like.  I really wish Mom would have opted to cook this year!  Oh well, they are a successful chain so there must be a lot of individuals that fit into the above criteria.",
