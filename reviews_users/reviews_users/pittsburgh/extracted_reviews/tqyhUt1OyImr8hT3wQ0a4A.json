Whew! It was pretty hefty, and although I thought the price would have stayed at $4.50 (the price of either the gyro or the eggplant parm hoagie), it ended up being $5.50, which I guess is fair, because I am a pain in the woo. Plus, a vendor had recently dropped off some experimental chocolate baklava (what a day!), of which I got to try a piece. So, that gyro: hefty, yes - delicious, yes - signs of frying life (oil!) all over my hands and napkins, yes - memorable, sure, I dunno. What most stuck out to me was the service, really - everyone there, including the owner, is thoughtful, sweet, and down-to-earth. Definitely a good place to grab lunch!",

The owner of this establishment, John, is such a genuine, kind, community-minded guy, you feel great supporting him. He is truly salt of the earth. He comes from a family who has long been in the local restaurant business; his parents once owned the Shiloh Inn on Mt. Washington. I believe it is more casual now, but at the time it was an elegant, old school affair, in the best sense of the words. That's not why you should frequent BFG, though. The food is delicious and so affordable! My understanding is that the baklava at BFG is homemade by John's Greek mother, which is truly a gift. Name another pizza joint where you can get a dessert made with such tradition and TLC. Not only is the food great, but the prices are so low, I can only assume they're designed to support a high-volume business. So, please, help them to sell out every night!

I am now officially a BFG junkie. Best Gyro's in Pittsburgh (sorry mike and tony's, but I'm over it), and the prices are obscenely low. Also, the employees and the owner are wonderfully nice.

    "text": "It's taken me a year to find out that the BFG cafe wasn't named after a weapon in Doom, and that it therefore wasn't some sort of internet cafe as I had expected. No, in fact, BFG cafe stands for Big Fat Greek cafe, presumably because if you eat here regularly you will be big and fat, and the fact that they serve gyros. Additionally, BFG stands for Bloomfield-Friendship-Garfield, the three nearest neighborhoods to the cafe(Well actually East Liberty is probably closer than Bloomfield but nobody wants to eat at the Enormous Large Fat Greek cafe, it's simply too verbose).  Walking in to the cafe is a big open kitchen, well over half the room, a few vending machines for drinks, and a seating area to the side. Seating is actually plentiful here as it appears the cafe is two spaces combined. The food here is my favorite kind: cheap. The most expensive item on their menu is a large speciality pizza for $13. 9\" hoagies and gyro sandwiches are $5 and under, fries are about a buck, and \"pittsburgh-style\" salads and 12\" pizzas are about $5-7. Simply put, they're hard prices to beat: a spinach-feta pizza and a gyro(big enough that I didn't even make it to the pizza) cost me $11 after tax.   The gyro was excellent, and though not enough to usurp my stomach's other Big Fat Greek champion(My Big Fat Greek Gyro), the price and convenience of this place easily makes up for it.  The pizza had a very thin crust and had a nice seasoning to it. Toppings weren't skimped on, but I had a little trouble finding the feta on the slice I did attempt. They also threw tomatoes on it for free, because the guy on the phone thinks they're a nice touch, and, I did too.  Shockingly, BFG didn't replace Salt as my favorite restaurant in this stretch of Penn ave, but for cheap sandwich while I'm working from home or for a pizza dinner when I don't feel like cooking, this is a great place to have in the neighborhood",

The area by the door is more for carry out; there's a couple tables. Inside, though, there's a lot more seating. The restaurant area is roomy and, although it's not fancy, it's homey. The owner and employees also really contribute to this feel. I got the impression that the owner knew everyone who walked in, and customers made it a point to say goodbye to everyone working there on their way out. There was also a mix-up in our group about when we would eat, but the owner was extremely patient and accommodating.  We only ordered pizza, so I can't speak for the Greek items on the menu that they're named for (Big Fat Greek). I did hear they have good gyros, though, and their prices seem pretty low for everything.  I watched them roll out preportioned bags of pizza dough and add sauce, cheese, and toppings. The pizza was served hot and delicious. Their pizza sauce has no sweet taste like others I've tried in the area. The pizza overall was good, but not particularly spectacular. I did really enjoy the crust, though--it was crispy on the outside (including the part under the sauce and cheese, which is often soggy) and soft (almost too soft and doughy) inside.  Although this place is a little out of my way, if I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely try other items from their menu.",

    "text": "Turns out the BFG is not just a childhood storybook  classic by Roald Dahl....it's also a hole in the wall restaurant conveniently located across the street from the children's home of Pittsburgh in Lawrenceville. I've had the privilege of eating here for lunch these past few weeks and trialing several different items from the menu, each one equally delicious and satiating as the last. The falafel has a unique creamy and thick texture, the grape leaves are warm and wrapped around delicately seasoned rice, and the Greek feta salad is a generous and fresh portion of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta cheese - make sure you ask for the homemade Italian dressing (it's addicting, I sometimes wonder if I'm ordering the salad as a vehicle for the dressing itself!)... and every time I brought over my lunch to a meeting back at the hospital, all the staff recognized the bag it came in and noted how delicious the food is - definitely felt like the cool kid at the table! Thanks for making lunch the best part of the day over the past few weeks, I will certainly be making trips back here!",

    "text": "My first take of BFG cafe - since there are many things I would like to still try on the menu.   Our fam. Called in for pick up (which was busy for 15 minutes) just before giving up we tried again and got though. Maybe online ordering option in the future?   I ordered grape leaves, humus and pita,  Results on That: I like there humus although it was not what I expected- it's more like a red pepper hummus and it's very sweet - not as nutty as a tahini flavor i expected. Still good though.  The grape leaves - (okay so it's unfair a little because my father makes grape leaves as do I, family recipe I may be bias) it was very daring to put lentils in. To me its under-flavored. Could use Fresh lemon juice on top and the leaves are a little firm - easier to roll but harder to chew up.  I think it has potential but just needs a simple tweak and then I would order it again and again. I do love lentils and it might help to salt the mix a bit (more?)  Daughter had pizza- can't really screw that up  Hubby had chicken gyro and fries. He says the veggies taste great but the chicken maybe a slight bit dry for his taste. He anticipates on trying the original next.   Overall good start. They seem very friendly at the counter. Oh we also bought up the last Baklava at the time! Yum was perfect  I'd like to change this review to five stars next time next week.",

The food was amazing, the portions were huge, and the price was extremely reasonable. We ordered ahead over the phone, and the time they estimated was almost exactly how long it took for it to be ready. The service was great, and the staff was friendly.   We only ordered out, but there was a dine in area as well. There Greek menu included many great options, and they had limited dessert options as well! We also ordered the chocolate cheesecake, which was delicious as well.   The locality of the restaurant also made me love it. The design was simple, and they had many posters of local events posted on the windows! I will be back in the near future to try more of their food!",

    "text": "Since I've been here several more times and tried several more items since my original review, I feel that an update is called for.  I may have been a bit too harsh in my original review, so I'll try to be more balanced and articulate this time.  There are several things that I like about BFG.  I like that it's an unpretentious community eatery that serves the neighborhood in which it's located, a fact that's reflected in the type of food that they serve, the price point, and the employees (yeah, that's right, I refuse to use the term \"help\") that they hire.  This contrasts with some other eateries along Penn Ave. in the vicinity, which draw a more yuppie East End crowd.  (Disclaimer: I'm an East End yuppie!)  BFG's commitment to the community is even reflected in the wall art, which is from local artists, as I mentioned before.  The owner and staff are very friendly, and are gracious hosts to a group that I attend that meets here on Mon. evenings.  On the other hand, I find the food to be rather hit-or-miss.  Some of it, such as the grape leaves and pita with tzatziki, the fries, and the baklava, is pretty decent.  Other items, such as the pizza (which I find too greasy for my liking) and the chicken gyro I mentioned in my previous review, leave room for improvement.  Given the price point, though, I can't complain too much, and since I return regularly, I'll figure out what I enjoy and will stick to ordering that.  As a side note, BFG was broken into the weekend before last, and is still struggling to deal with the repercussions of the break in (when I visited last night, the glass on the front door was still broken).  If you're in the neighborhood, consider stopping by to show some support!  3.5 stars for providing good hospitality and A-OK food on a consistent basis.",

Fries were almost too big of a portion.  The inside is pretty nice, and kind of reminds me of some unassuming Mexican restaurants down in Austin - warm colors, bright artwork, stucco-feeling. Unfortunately, it was like 90 degrees and the place surprisingly doesn't have air conditioning, so we took our food to go. I'd like to come back on a cooler day to actually dine in sometime!  I'm surprised how early they close at night - it may be unlikely that I'm ever able to get dinner here. It'd be nice to have an alternative to Spak for when they are so busy they aren't even picking up their phones.",

When I saw that they had gyros, I had to check it out.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a classic gyro*.  Both were good, and the gyro had a generous amount of meat compared to other places I've tried in the are so far.  In short:  good food, great prices.  The man who served me, who may have been the owner (I was too hungry to be chatty), seemed a very pleasant individual.  Seating was ample, atmosphere was comfortable, and they offered me water, which I did want but forgot to ask for.  No complaints.  I highly recommend eating here.  I will be back to try the pizza, and of course have more gyros.  *Note - a cheeseburger AND a gyro would probably be too much food for most people at a single sitting.  The portions are not small, I just have the capacity to eat a lot.",
