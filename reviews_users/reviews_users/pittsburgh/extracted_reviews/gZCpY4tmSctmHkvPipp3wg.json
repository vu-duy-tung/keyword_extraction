The rice, beans and cabbage are a very good compliment to the chicken.  FYI the jerk wings are phenomenal. I stop in about every other week it's so good",

Ultimately, what keeps a restaurant open with continuous positive reviews isn't only the food. It's the CUSTOMER SERVICE. And in True Jamaican fashion, theirs STINK. Luckily they aren't the only restaurant in Pittsburgh that provides great Caribbean dishes because I sure will not be a repeat customer. Based on their customer service alone, I threw away over $40 worth of food in the TRASH. It's that serious! A recommendation would be to address their Receptionist/Cashier's ATTITUDE along with her choice of clothing since she is clearly IGNORANT to the concept of presentable work attire or customer service! Represent your country and your culture better! Damn DISGRACE!",

This Ox Tail tastes like they flew it in.  The cabbage is cooked to perfection and the cornbread, lord Jesus the cornbread... It has a carrot cake taste that's out of this world.  I was going to get Classic jerk chicken and the bro came out with a piece of Ox Tail for a sampling and I immediately changed my order.  The greatest part is I shook Leon's actual hand.  I'm proud to say I met him.  We talked about #MCMstudios and different topics till I made my way.  I promised him not only would I be back, but I'd send everyone I knew there.  It's located right in the thriving revival neighborhood that is Arlington Pittsburgh.  Go there, this is THE real deal. #pittsburghfood #imsoburgh #leonscaribbean #islandfood the pic does the smell and flavor and look no justice.",

The chicken party had good flavor and dough was likely filo dough. Ratio of chicken and dough was not what I had expected, with there being more dough than filling. Since the pastry looked as if it had puffed up and opened during cooking, some filling may have came out. I would be willing to try a beef one though.",

I waited 1 hour for an order of Oxtail Stew, with absolutely NO regrets. It had me gnawing on bones (like a lady, of course), hungry for every last bite, The food is the reason this place has won over so many loyal fans. Delicious, worth-waiting-for food. Spiced to absolute perfection, I could not be happier with my meal here. The guy even threw me a piece of the delicious bread (which honestly tastes like coffee cake, but pairs extraordinarily well with the savory/spicy fare) while I was waiting. If you like well-spiced, savory, delectable food, you absolutely MUST try Leon's!",

The prices are reasonable. You can get a lunch special for $6 of either curry chicken, brown stew chicken or jerk chicken. I've only ever had the curry chicken and it was great. I've had the jerk wings and they were very spicy and I typically like spicy.   I've also had the curry goat. Not the best. It needed to cook for a little longer because the meat didn't really fall off the bone. Some pieces were actually a little tough to get off the bone. My mother in law makes the best curry goat so I'm a little biased!",

I ordered for pickup and my food was ready for me half an hour later, smelling delicious.  What'd we get this year?  ESCOVITCHED SNAPPER:  I didn't order this.  I ordered the BROWN STEW FISH, but ended up with this instead.  Which wouldn't have been terrible except that it was SUPER dry and we didn't enjoy it...at all.  The snappers they use are already on the small side (like 1/4 inch thick fillets), so they definitely need to be cooked in some sauce.  The brown stew gravy is normally perfect.  OXTAIL STEW: A knockout, per usual.  Rich, fall off the bone, with beautiful bits of tendon.  JERK CHICKEN: No complaints here, our small order came with 4 big, saucy pieces of tender chicken meat.  ESCOVITCHED WINGS:  Ordered this to try something new.  The wings came topped with vegetables, which weren't our favorite flavor.  I mean, they were wings, so they weren't bad, but we vastly preferred the jerk chicken.  I guess the escovitched style just isn't for us, taste and moisture-wise.  We're saucy people.  While we still had a great meal, I was deeply disappointed by the fish mix-up, as this was my favorite dish previously.  But I suppose there are much bigger disappointments to be had on Valentine's Day, so cheers to an otherwise successful date night.",

The jerk chicken is to die for--every single piece is smoked perfectly, and the meat is so tender that it literally falls off the bone. The spiciness was also a surprising kick. They don't hold back on the spices! Which is a big reason that everything is so tasty here. Other good choices we tried here were the oxtail and curry goat, both of which, though bony by nature, came with a lot of meat and just as seasoned. Portions are overall pretty big, and rice and beans make a good side. Just don't come in too late, since the one time we did they ran out of rice and some of their entrees!",

Unfortunately,  because I arrived after 6:30 pm a couple of the dishes I ordered were substitutes (wanted to try the chicken patties and jerk pork; but they were out). I bought the last beef patties and was nervous they would be dry. They weren't.  The dough still had a velvety texture and the meat was seasons well.   I have a mild tolerance for heat, so the jerk wings were too spicy for me. The more heat tolerable members of my family were more than happy to eat my share.  I would go back for huge bowls of the rice and beans.  So good. The cabbage on the side was also very tasty. Parking was difficult and the street difficult to navigate.  I plan to go back, because there are more items I want to try.  Only reason I didn't rate this a 5 is that I desire a more welcoming atmosphere. I figured it was due to them being busy (phone orders were also coming in, along with the 3 orders being placed before mine).",

    "text": "Ordered: Large jerk chicken, Large oxtail stew Price: $23.54 w/o tip  Ambiance: The place is very barebones with minimal decorations and only 2 tables for dining in. They were playing rap music in the background and the cashier flipped between singing the lyrics, struggling with his iPad, and taking my order. It also didn't help he seemed impaired by some substance or other because he was mumble-slurring his words and difficult to understand. To their credit however, the place seemed clean and the server genuinely seemed proud of the food when he gave it to us, saying to remember where the food came from, to enjoy it, and to come back some time.  Food: The oxtails were a smidge dry (happens when cooked at too high a temp) but the flavor was rich and savory. A large portion had maybe 4 larger bones with 4-5 smaller tail bones and most of the pieces were tender enough. The jerk chicken carried a good amount of heat (coming from a spice fiend) but the strongest notes were the allspice and cloves. A little more soy and maybe some coriander would've given it more earthy body to round it out. The rice and boiled veges were perfectly cooked and not too mushy although I'm always sad when there are no fried plantains included like other places I've been.  Overall I thought the food was good but not something I'll seek out again.  There are better meals in the city that actually offer a dining experience, are better executed, and aren't as shady for a similar price.",

What I love about this place is that it's no-fuss and very casual, and they serve delicious food. I had such a hard time choosing what to eat though; everything sounded excellent!! I did end up choosing the jerk shrimp though. It was wonderful. I could definitely taste the flavor and it had many different spices to it. The rice and beans and cabbage were great as well, they were fresh and tasty. The cornbread was awesome; it had a nice cinnamon-y taste to it which kind of reminded me of eating a cinnamon roll. Dessert with dinner, that's a bonus!!!!! ;) It was very moist and was hot, like it had just been taken out of the oven. Mmm. :) I really wanted plantains, so my dad and I shared those on the side. The plantains were the perfect combination of sweet and savory; they were exceptional. The food portions are huge, they give you a giant styrofoam container and fill it up with your meal all the way to the top. For a lot of food (my dad, my sister, and I ate here), the total cost was under 50 bucks! You can't beat that. The man at the counter was friendly and cared about making our experience a great one. All in all, I'll definitely come back to Leon's!!!!",
