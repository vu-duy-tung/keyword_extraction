    "text": "Live in Bloomfield and have been here many times: Good:  1. Salads and cheesy bread are consistently good. Also the cheesy bread is enormous and costs less than a draft beer. Since it comes with marinara sauce, the cheesy bread is a cost effective hack for a medium pizza. Homemade balsamic vinaigrette is also solid. 2. Nice variety of craft beers... Both draft and bottle, which is self-serve. They also change the draft beers frequently. They even host events where breweries from throughout the country come up and do keg-tappings. 3. Lots of televisions... Good place to watch sporting events. Bad: 1. Service is consistently bad. Slow service. Inattentive service. Obscenely long waits to get food. Etc. Don't come here expecting a quicker meal.  2. Although they have a good, rotating variety of draft beers, the majority of them (at least as of the last couple times I'd been there) have a higher ABV and are served in small glasses like tulips or snifters. I'm not anti-high ABV but it would be nice to have some craft beers that are not as strong, served by the pint. Even some beers that have more normal 5-6.5 ABVs are served in smaller ounce glasses but still are charged as if they were served by the pint. Kinda seems like price-gouging. Indifferent: 1. Ambience is dark even during the middle of day. One large front window is tinted and all the walls are black; however, there is a lot of cool brewery memorabilia on the walls. 2. They have a downstairs bar that features some different drafts. Never been.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I love beer. I love beer not in the \"yeah I drink KBS when it comes around\" way, I love beer in the \"I trade, travel for, and cellar some of the rarest beer in the world\" way. Fuss if you will about the food, that's subject to opinion, but fussing about the beer here is asinine.  Your glass smelled of bleach? Say something, I've never had an experience here where they wouldn't correct it! Your beer was too expensive for a small pour? Do your research. Those beers are very difficult to acquire, the kegs are extremely expensive, and typically the bar owners take a small margin just to be able to offer said beers at their establishment. In addition, most of those beers are very high in ABV, so it's responsible serving to not give 16oz of an 11% beer to customers.  I moved here from Philly (consistently rated one of the top beer cities in America), and it was extremely hard to find the rarer beers in Pittsburgh. Establishments like Caliente and a handful of others are bringing credibility to the craft beer community in Pittsburgh. The first day I walked in I breathed a long sigh of relief and thought, \"damn, I'm home\".  As for the food, I can't speak of the delivery as I always go in to enjoy my food with a beer. The pizza has always been properly cooked, and the other Pittsburgh standards of fried foods and rolls are pretty spot on. I don't go there to get a charcuterie and roast leg of lamb, I go there for solid wings and a world class beer. I really couldn't ask for more of a craft beer bar in Pittsburgh.  Last, I've had the opportunity to get to know the owners during my visits in the past year. If you see something wrong, think something is off, or are generally displeased, just tell them. Write your review, that's cool, but have the courtesy to let the business owner know so they can right the wrongs. Turns out they're really normal, nice people.",

    "text": "I go back and forth on Caliente. On one hand, it has one of the best draft lists in the immediate area. On the other? The service, pricing, and food leave something to be desired.   The good first. Caliente's draft list is awesome, and I've really enjoyed my visits to the basement bar (open weekends). It's a very different feel than the upstairs bar and restaurant, which lacks any sort of atmosphere. Caliente's Happy Hour deals are fantastic--from 4:30 to 6:30 on weekdays the drafts are half off!   After Happy Hour, my issues with Caliente outweigh the positives. First off, the service is nonexistent. I can't blame this on the staff itself, I the place seems severely understaffed. Every time I've visited, servers are running around trying to help everyone out, and in the end, it takes about double the time to place orders or get drinks.   I don't mean this as a cheapskate, but I've found some of the pricing on the draft list to be off. Last night, the always awesome Big Hop was on tap for $6.50... for a smaller goblet. That's a hard pill to swallow, since you can walk across the street to Lot 17 for a $5-6 Big Hop in a pint glass. I do understand the high price for many of the rare beers, but this just seemed fishy to me.   I've eaten in several times, and everything has been meh. I mean, it's bar food, so nothing fancy, but I'd rather get a pie down the street.   I recommend visiting Caliente for Happy Hour, getting an order of the Buffalo Fries, and allowing plenty of time for the slow service.",

Most of the beer selection was offered only in a tulip glass and ranged from $7-8.50 for a portion significantly smaller than a pint. BUT, the selection is extensive and has several local brews. Several televisions within a small place which is good for watching sports.   Would and should be a 4ish... I do recommend it though.",

Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. Maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?  Pros: +Pizza is GOOD  Cons: -Slow inattentive service -Slow delivery -general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons",

    "text": "When you're a pizza joint in Pittsburgh (or any city, for that matter), you better have something awesome going for you or you'll just be another pizza place lost in the numbers. Count Caliente in the latter group.  Caliente really offers up nothing new or memorable, unfortunately. The service we had while sitting at the bar was poor. The bartender was nice, but she spent more time talking to her friend who wasn't even paying for anything than waiting on us and other customers who had empty beers at the other end of the bar.   The mozzarella sticks weren't very hot when they came out, but were still the delicious kind that I love, so I wasn't going to let it bother me. The only downside is that you only get 4 sticks. The bummer in that portion was only magnified when the rest of the meal left a lot to be desired.  My chicken parmesan hoagie was clearly made with frozen patties, and there wasn't a lot of cheese or sauce on the hoagie. I definitely wouldn't order it again if I, for some strange reason, was eating there again.  The white pizza we ordered was okay, but it was more of a bland cheesy bread than a white pizza. Very little flavor, very little cheese, and none of that garlic/oil/seasoning flavor that you expect with a white pizza.  It's not a bad bar, though. Decent beer selection (although a beer list would be nice on the menu). We also liked the actual atmosphere, even though it was dead while we were there. Unfortunately, without an improvement in service and food, I don't see it being full of customers on a regular basis any time soon.",

Also have at least one beer or brewery on special each day.  The pizza here is pretty good but definitely not my favorite in the city.  Haven't tried much else on the food menu other than the burger which was decent.  If you're into craft beer though you HAVE to give callientes a try.  They make it a point to carry the best selection of bottles and drafts including hard to find brews from across the country.  I have come hear for several special tappings (Canadian breakfast stout, bourbon county stout, etc...) and the events have always been well run and gone smoothly.  Also they have a recently renovated downstairs bar which is open on busy nights and is great!",

I was a little disappointed during my last visit as on draft they mostly had Dogfish Head which I believe was leftover from a special event they had. Also the bottled beer selection was pretty low.  This is not typical though and I was still able to try 2 new bottled beers including the Deschutes summer ale which had a nice light flavor.  Their pizza is delicious and we went with a  medium sized pie with chicken, bacon, tomato, and ranch dressing as well as a small Hawaiian pizza. Both had lots of fresh toppings and even a few slices left to take home.The prices are right but the service is slow- I was surprised by how many waiters and waitresses they had on a Friday night and still it took over 15-20 minutes to order and a long waits in between  beers.",

Two nights ago my boyfriend and I were hanging out a friends, and we were crazy hungry at about 10pm. Caliente was suggested and chosen. We went for their five-cheese calzone and jalapeno poppers.   The food took about an hour to arrive, which I guess makes sense for a late night. We probably should have just walked there, but we were too lazy to do that, plus we were gaming.   The food arrived and it looked amazing. The calzone was definitely big enough for two people, but certainly could have fed three. At first bite I was in love. Cheesy deliciousness danced around my tongue and my hunger was sated. I was a bit of a challenge to eat it all though, so I shared with my friend.   The jalapeno poppers were pretty tasty too. They weren't overly fried or greasy. They were just right! They could have been spicier though.   There's not a lot else I can say about Caliente. Their pizza and food is consistently delicious, they employ friendly people and the price is right for what you get. I highly recommend Caliente and some of their great happy-hour deals.",

Just got delivery first off the delivery driver was an older dark haired woman I paid with a credit card over the phone she gave me the receipt to sign when she got here..I signed it and gave it back and she said \"what about the tip\" I said haha funny you ask as I had her CASH tip in my hand. Never ask for a tip I should of kept the tip I gave her just because she had the nerve to ask.  We took our food and opened it up I got a chicken ranchero pizza it had no ranch on it at all and also asked for a side of ranch with my friends chicken tenders didn't get any... my pizza is so dry I rather feed it to my dog. HORRIBLE.",

We sat there for a good 20-25 minutes before we were even acknowledged. The server walked past us plenty of times to wait on her other tables and never said a word to us. I get it if you're busy but you could at least acknowledge us with something like a \"be right with you\". Nothing. Finally she comes over and is the most miserable person I've ever experienced. She was short with us and very rude and very inattentive. They had Yard bottles on special and when we asked what varieties they had she literally said to us, \"It's whatever bottles are on that top row of that cooler. It's a 'serve yourself' deal\" as she pointed annoyedly at the cooler. We walk up to the cooler to find they're completely out of all the yard bottles, which would have been nice for her to know before she charged them to our tab. Another customer was the one to tell us they had been out for awhile.. Brought us our wings with no ranches and one napkin each..really. It's wing night, we need napkins... The wings themselves were either over or undercooked. Some were hard and dry, some had pink in the middle. Surprised we didn't get sick. Caliente was never mind blowing but it was never this god awful. Never, ever again. I truly don't know how they stay in business if this is now their norm.",

    "text": "I visited last night around 6pm with a friend to check Caliente out, since I'd never been before and had a City Dining Card.  Our visit got off to a poor start when my friend and I went to order the winter sangria that was the daily special, and were told they were out (it's not like it was super late).  I eventually ended up ordering a sour peach lambic that was interesting, if pricey ($7.50--I could have had a cocktail at that price), and my friend ordered nothing but water.  For our food, we ordered the following: Cajun fries ($5.99), cheesy bread sticks ($6.99), and 16\" chicken ranchero pizza ($16.99).  Shortly after taking our order, our waiter returned to inform us that the kitchen was out of salsa for the fries (???).  He told us the fries also come with nacho cheese, so I asked him to put it on the side for us.  In my experience, Cajun fries are fries with a Cajun spice rub, and do not include salsa or nacho cheese (maybe these were Eastern Texan Cajun fries?).  I was glad I ordered the nacho cheese on the side, because my friend and I agreed that it tasted weird with the Cajun rub.  The Cajun rub itself was good, but the fries were pretty greasy, with some sticking together, so be forewarned of this.  As for the breadsticks and pizza, they were less than impressive.  Since they both include crust and cheese, they tasted pretty similar, and the amount of bacon on the breadsticks was less than impressive.  I didn't find them particularly flavorful, and the marinara sauce that comes with them was watery.  The pizza was a bit better on the flavor front due to the ranch dressing, but the amount of chicken was less than impressive.  The crust of the pizza is thick, and the overall effect and flavor reminded me of Bites and Brews' pizza, which I also find mediocre.  The fact that we only finished about (and took) half of it is evidence that both of us found it unimpressive.  Needless to say, my friend and I were less than impressed with Caliente.  Now that I've used my City Dining Card, I probably won't return, given the number of better pizza places in PGH.  One positive is that they do have good happy hour specials, so if you want cheap food and drinks, this may be your place.  However, if you're looking for quality, I suggest that you go elsewhere.",

When I opened up the pizza, which was pepperoni and extra sauce, I found two large containers of marinara, smashing two of the pieces of pizza down. I can't even fathom how anyone who works at a pizza shop could possibly think that's what extra sauce means.... I'll never order again. Try Ephesus instead!",

It was prefabricated--I'm guessing Lipton Brisk, not freshly brewed. I'd asked for no lemon, but it was lemon-flavored. The service was worse.  We arrived at 5:15 PM. We ordered by 5:30. We'd ordered the above-mentioned salads and three pizzas. The pizzas got to our table at 6:42! The server said she'd take 10% off after we'd waited for 40 minutes. When the pizza finally came, my brother asked to speak to the manager. The manager argued (!) with my brother about what was going on and then blamed short-staffing. My brother said we could have ordered for pick up and it would have been quicker. The manager said all orders were done in order.  Problem was, that another table had come in after us, ordered pizza after us, and had eaten and left before we got our pizza. There were major failures all-around and nobody would just confess to having made a mistake. They ended up giving us 25% off, but all-in-all, it was a terrible experience.",

If you look at their draft list, there are few beers than make it into a pint glass now.  Snifters and tulips seem to be the norm. I'm sad to say I've stopped going to Caliente because of this.  While I love what they bring to the table and their pizza is really good...I can go elsewhere and spend less, and have the same experience and beer now.

I handed it to her and she just tossed it on the counter and said she didn't know who's it was.  Then when I got home my pizza was cold...not just warm...cold.  I won't be back and I feel bad for whoever's hoagie that was.",

They had one poor bastard working there on the Sunday night before Memorial Day and it was like one of the only places open on the street. One person at the bar and doing table service for food. Service was predictably, cripplingly slow. Assuming this was a one off because of the holiday weekend I would give this place another try. The patrons having shouting matches outside also provided nice, light evening entertainment.",

We would order from them probably once a week. they had fantastic specialty pizza and great plain normal pizza as well.  HOWEVER, they went through a change in management and I think they changed their food company because all of a sudden it went downhill quick! We ordered salads from there one night and not only did they tell us that it was going to take 45 minutes for PICKUP but they weren't even ready when we got there 50 minutes later. we asked for extra ranch when ordering and asked if it was in there when we picked up. The response was \"uh, it should be\" Needless to say it was not.  The salads were disappointing to say the least. Another time, the delivery driver \"supposedly\" got lost coming to the house. we literally live on the same block one street over! Such a shame because this place was awesome when it opened.  I will never order there again.",

    "text": "For the record, me and the girlfriend WANT to love this place, but after 2 visits over the past couple weeks, it is simply in our \"okay\" column. Why?  Well, first, let me say that Caliente's hits 2 of our 3 metrics for becoming a fan favorite: beer selection and food quality. Both times we've been to Caliente's the pizza, wings and fries have been pretty good to great. And the beer selection is perfect for microbrew worshipers like ourselves, with bottles, cans AND drafts galore. However, they score low in our 3rd metric of service. Not that the service is rude or absolutely terrible. It is just not good. It is the slow, lack of attention and detail that irks us. We tip well and we demand more attentive service. First trip we sat at the bar. The guy there was nice enough, but several times he passed us when we had empty drinks and twice we asked him for things like a glass of water and we actually saw him start to get it, but get sidetracked talking to coworkers and regulars and remember after 5 minutes when he came back to our part of the bar. Last night, we were inadvertently charged for an item we \"won\" on their Facebook page. And the waitress went out to smoke while our empty water glasses remained at full attention in the end if our table...in the dining room area with no one else there. I'm starting to wonder if this is why the place seems empty on weekend nights. This place is so close to being a contender...the service just needs to pick up before we will come back again.",

Apparently this is the new \"cool\" hangout spot, or so I've heard. I guess they're hosting shows, etc. and really trying to make this more of a bar than a restaurant, which is cool since I didn't find the food particularly good.  BUT...the bartenders here are HORRIBLE. I mean, they are really just bad bartenders, at least the two that were there the night I was there (and apparently are like always there). The one girl looked angry the whole time and wouldn't give me a straw for my cranberry vodka (seriously, who wants to drink well vodka without a straw?). She also gave attitude when my friend asked for a lime for her Tecate (again, who wants to drink Tecate without lime?). AND she didn't even open the beer, which I'm pretty sure is illegal (my friend has since been back and said that this is a common occurrence). The male bartender tried a lame attempt at flirting with me by continuously mentioning my bright red shorts. And then my friend's double gin-and-ginger-ale got knocked over literally a minute after she paid for it, and the bartender witnessed it, and he charged her for it!! I know the bartender's not required to comp you a drink or anything...but every time this has happened to me (most recently, at Mad Mex...I was talking with my hands a little too enthusiastically...), the bartender hasn't made me pay for a replacement drink. And I didn't have to ask, either. LAME!  Weirdly...the pizza I saw some people eating looked nothing like the pizza I received when I ordered delivery from them. So maybe I did get a bad one, who knows.",

Today the staff experience was an exception (in the beginning), but rest of the visit left me with a sour taste. Decided to stop in for a quick burger and a beer before meeting up with friends. Ordered a beer and a cheeseburger from the very nice female bartender. I sipped my beer, so as to make it last until I was able to enjoy it with my burger...then 30 minutes went by. The cheeseburger finally arrived overcooked and under-cheesed. It was basically boiled meat on a deli bun, no juice at all. By this time, the nice female bartender had been replaced by a man who was very curt with his customers. No, I'm not mistaking busy for curt. The gentleman who sat next to me asked what was good on tap and he just turned away and said \"all of it's good.\"  I was hoping this could be my go-to place for a quick bite and a brew, as I live just 2 blocks away. Turns out stopping in for a quick bite is actually an hour commitment. I'll probably go back for the pizza, but that would be about it.",

If I could look past the service this would be a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but again the service consistently sucks.   Let's review the service first and just get this out of the way. Tonight we came in and it was moderately busy so we sat/stood at the bar.  We all ordered beers (at least 3 on their draught list were kicked but still on the chalk board. How hard is it to erase a chalk board?) and our friends ordered a pizza.  The wait wasn't long for the pizza but when the kitchen brought out the pizza they just set it on the back bar. And there it sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender and servers walked by it and wouldn't make eye contact with us.  Finally my friends were served their lukewarm pizza after we pointing out that it was there.  No apologies or acknowledgment of an issue were given. When it started to clearing out we moved to a table and had some more beers. At the end of the night a friend had to leave early so he cashed out his tab.  After our friend had left the bartender came over and stated that he had given our tab to my friend whom had left so we would need to pay his which was much larger.  He stated that we could just get the money back from our friend for the difference later on.  Once again no real apology was given.  I am really not sure how his mental error became my problem but it seems kind of ridiculous that I became responsible for it and it isn't like there is a manager on duty to deal with.  Onto the good stuff.  The pizza is well above average and my wife especially loves the buffalo chicken pizza. The wings are some of the best in town.  Fried crisp and sauced properly.  The beer list is also one of the best in the east end.  They boast around 20 taps and the selection is always unique and well rounded for even the most demanding beer guy or girl.  Bottom line, I'll come back. But I know that service will probably continue to suck and that I really have to be proactive as a customer when I am there.",

Someone brought us pizza and salad from Caliente a few weeks ago and it seemed like a lot of food and the pizza and salad were good so we decided to try it for ourselves.  Although the pizza was tasty and the quality of the food seemed good, the little amount of food we received was insulting.  For $100 plus delivery and tip, we got only 2 pizzas and 2 VERY SMALL salads.  The salads were supposed be large and feed 15-16 people and they charged us $65.  I think we maybe were able to feed 8 people.  $65 for salad?!?!  People wanted to eat mostly salad with a piece of pizza which we were unable to do because the salad were so small.  When i called to speak to the restaurant, they said \"nothing we can do\"  We will never order from here again and you shouldn't either.  The service is obviously terrible and they do not care about their customers.  Spend $100 elsewhere, I'm sure you will get more for your money.",

We've been here a handful of times (maybe 5?) and have been disappointed every time.  While the beer selection is great, the prices are simply outrageous.  A 22oz specialty beer for $19?  I've found the same beers at around $12-$14 in other spots.  Our experience with the food is limited.  The only thing we've tried is the fried zucchini, but it was pretty awful.  Limp, flavorless mush with a side of marinara that was basically just plain tomato sauce.  We have avoided their pizzas on the assumption that the same sauce is used.  Despite the over-priced beer and mediocre food, we may have continued to pop in from time to time, but for our 2 most recent experiences which made me feel like the management/ownership of this place is just downright dishonest.  Caliente has taken to advertising pint nights (buy a beer, keep the glass).  The first one we tried to go to, we got there around 9:45, and were informed that they were out of glasses.  They said the special started at 7.  OK, that's not unreasonable.  So the next time, we got there around 7:20.  What do you know?  Out of glasses.  The manager looked at me and said, \"They go fast!\"  That may be True, but then: get more glasses!  I don't need free glassware to patronize a place, but I do find it extremely insulting when a business advertises something like this to get you through the door, then doesn't deliver.  Running out of a special in 20 minutes isn't a special - it's a fire sale.  The beer selection may be good, but we won't be going back.",

At least have the decency to display your prices so your customers have the option I walk out before ordering. But I guess that's part of the plan because no one would stay if you did.

On another night I had a steak sandwich... the meat was cold and tough, the bread was dry and stiff, and the fries on it were also cold. Least this time the fries on the plate were cooked. So recently the sandwiches have been terrible. I'm afraid to try the pizza... hope it hasn't gone downhill as well. Fortunately, the bartenders are still friendly",

After happy hour there are usually some other great specials that start at 7:00.   My only qualm is the normal draft prices and the prices on toppings for pizzas (spinach in particular). In my opinion, soggy canned spinach should not be a \"premium fresh\" topping that costs close to $5 to be tossed onto a pie.   In summary, check the online draft list and if you see something intriguing, head there for happy hour.",

When we got there we were told they had run out at 5 PM of this pizza. We received no notification of this until we got to the restaurant. Since we still wanted to try the pizza we called the Bloomfield location and they had two left, but a 45 minute wait for pick up. We drove down to the Bloomfield location and decided to stay and eat it there since there were seats open at the bar. Our first impression was that there were toppings missing. In looking at the articles and pictures of the pizza online there was a very sparse amount of bacon on it, no porchetta at all , and no shaved Parmesan. There was Rapini, but not much flavor of garlic or shallots in the pizza. The dough was undercooked. They had indicated they were busy , but perhaps they forgot part of the toppings on the pizza. We were disappointed in not being able to have this pizza made the way it was supposed to have been made and not getting what we paid for. I realize this is a newer pizza, but they need to get consistency down with making it correctly.",

If you can even call it chicken, it was rubbery and gross. But my friends pizza was good, I like th crust. Even if the chicken was warm the salad was still pretty gross.

This was because they did not make the original order (although it was paid for), and simply reentered the order a second time.

This is was definitely a good plan B!  The atmosphere was pretty chill, we sat in the small dining room in the back of the bar. As the night went on, it got to be a bit crowded, but still decent enough to hear each other's conversations. The decor is pretty urban and has a city-feel to it.   I was impressed by their selection of beer. I'm not a beer-expert, but I feel like most fanatics would enjoy this place. Their specials were good and had lots of interesting choices!   We ordered an appetizer of loaded fries and a buffalo chicken pizza. The fries were awesome and massive! Definitely worth the money. They were thin-cut and fried perfectly. The pizza was great, too! It was my first time trying a buffalo chicken pizza so I was a bit apprehensive, but boy was it good! It did have a kick to it (good news for you hot sauce lovers out there!) that made me reach for my water quite often.  The only downfall was service. Our waitress was friendly, but wasn't around often. We als waited a decent amount of time for our food to come out. She did look like to have the whole dining room to herself, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt.   We will definitely be back soon to try some more! We tend to eat dinner later than most, so I love the luxury of a late-night kitchen!",

We ordered the loaded fries and breaded zucchini to start. They were both delicious! Although they were amazing, they weren't anything out of the ordinary when it comes to bar appetizers.  Next, we ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and the jalapeno bacon rolls. I assumed we would be receiving two small orders, since they were only $7 each and I became adjusted to receiving small portions of rolls at restaurants.   No. There were six rolls in each order and they were HUGE. I was only able to finish one of each and I was completely stuffed. They were homemade and absolutely amazing. The flavors were awesome and they went deliciously with their homemade ranch.   I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Caliente's. I assumed it was going to be just another pizza bar, but it wasn't at all. Awesome service, a great selection of drafts and OUT of this WORLD rolls! I also ordered pepperoni rolls to go and gave them to my cousin- she loved them too!",

    "text": "First, I want to state that this rating is NOT in relation to the food quality. The food we were served was superb!  The reason I am giving the Liberty Ave store this two star rating is due to the quality of service. My friends and I arrived at the bar after two other bars had quit serving food hours ago. This was my first time at any Caliente location. My friends had informed me about the delicious food, even one secret item named after my friend, the great beer and the good people who run it. So needless to say that on a Saturday night,where the weather had turned for better, I expected what I had been told.   The server seemed frustrated that there were so many of us (to be clear we were only 8). She begrudgingly gave us individual checks and she was not attentive to our needs as far as refills. She also did not inform us of last call, I had realized the lights were brightened and then inquired. She wasn't interested in getting our last round, and another friend of mine had to hold her attention so she wouldn't run off with only 2 of us giving the last orders.   My friend and I were the only people who got plates and silverware because we ordered an extra large pizza. Everyone else was served in to go boxes. At 1:30am! I was shocked at how rude this was. Then at 1:50pm \"Closing Time\" came on the radio. We were all amused and joking about it, until it came on again and again. Whoever was on duty for management last night was an embarrassment. The made callous choices and did not hold up to the service level I was told about.   I don't know if I will return to this location. Which is sad because my Thai pizza was fantastic.",

    "text": "The pizza is some of the best in Pittsburgh but time and time again I go in there and get the worst service in the city.  This time, my last, all I wanted to do is put in a to-go order for a pizza. I walked up to the bar, waited 10 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged me. Asked what I wanted to drink and I told her I'd like to place an order. Hands me a menu (I already knew what I wanted) and immediately walks away without taking the order.   She then starts talking with other people. Hugging what I assume were her friends for another 5 minutes. Then gives me a water. (Still hasn't taken my pizza order yet). Walks back and forth another 5 min and then FINALLY asks what I want to eat.   This is the norm here. Getting ignored from servers and bartenders and getting terrible service when you finally get their attention. Acting like you're doing someone a favor is not how you treat people coming to your restaurant. But, that's the price you pay for above average pizza and good beer selection I guess.",

We sat down at the bar waited a good ten minutes before we got drinks and given that the bartender was pregnant we cut a lot of slack because we r also in the service industry.  So we tried several times to put in a food order but she never came back to our side of the bar but the guys four seats away got there food order put in, so when this wonderful lady that was making sure everyone had there to go orders she came and she acknowledged the fact that we needed more things ( I didn't kno the ladies name but she was shorter with glasses) she took our order gave it to the bartender to help her out because she wasn't moving fast at all and right in front of us she said to the girl next time tell them to wait and were just like we tried to give u our order and she is trying to help you out and in the ugliest tone and attitude u tell us to wait until u have time to get our order I totally understand the business and she was the only one there but accept the help and don't racially profile because our money spends just like everyone else and we were the only ones not being served CALIENTE never again",

    "text": "I am giving Caliente one star because I can't give any less. This used to be a place I went to often when in Bloomfield. When it opened, it was a pizza place I could sit down at with my friends, after Doc's in Shadyside closed. However, in the last few years, I have been growing increasingly unhappy with Caliente. My last three experiences have sealed the deal that this establishment will never get my business again. About a month ago, I moved to Bloomfield after living in multiple neighborhoods in the city. Some friends and I went to celebrate the move over happy hour. The three of us ordered a round of beers, pepperoni rolls, a dozen wings, and an order fries. We waited an hour for our food (please note, this was at around 3:30pm and with very few other patrons in the building). All of our food came out together despite the pepperoni rolls being requested as the appetizer. In the two hours we were there, we ordered one more round (not without trying to order more) and our checks.  The second experience was my friend and I ordering pizza for delivery. A simple cheese pizza. The pizza was paid for, but it never came. She was offered a free pizza when she went in to complain the next day, but the damage had been done. The third and final straw was a few days ago. My boyfriend and I went in to grab an easy and seemingly quick meal. We ordered breadsticks, pepperoni rolls, 1/2 boneless wings with fries, and a fish sandwich. Within 20 minutes, the pepperoni rolls and wings came. The waitress admitted that she forgot to put in the fries. I declined to wait for them. She, also, promised that my boyfriend's breadsticks and fish sandwich would be out soon. I made the decision to wait until his food came so we could eat together. We saw two tables of 3/4, that sat down after us, get their full pizzas for each person before our entire meal. After 45 minutes, we began debating our options. My boyfriend has worked in the service industry for over a decade, so it takes a lot for him to negatively speak about a place while in it. While we were non-verbally discussing things, his food finally came. The breadsticks looked like they gave up and just tried to get the food out. They were of various sizes and shapes. Just dough thrown together in a vertical way to be baked. Our waitress gave us a discount on our meal, but the damage was done. We paid and left. When we were walking home, we saw four cooks standing outside bullshitting. I have no problem with breaks, but with four cooks, they should not have been that backed up. Additionally, the service is usually what holds Caliente back, but in my last experience, the flavor was not there. I will not be back. Sorry, Caliente - it's been real.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a cool local place to hang and enjoy some good beers, Caliente is it.  Their beers, both bottled and on tap (including many local selections), rotate frequently so there's always a fresh selection.  I usually order a flight so I can try a few beers when it's too difficult to decide on just one or two.  The website is also updated regularly with the current draft and bottle list.  It's also good to know that they will fill any growler with almost any of their draft selections.  Caliente offers daily food and drink specials in addition to their weekday happy hour specials.  The food isn't high class, but I'd say it's better than your average bar food.  I've thrown the kitchen a curve ball when I ordered fries with the special request that they be tossed in the garlic parm sauce used for wings and they delivered.  I've tried several of their other wing flavors (I prefer the boneless in the Blues Brothers sauce), the Italian and Steak subs, the gourmet pizzas and even a calzone (which they will warn you might take some extra time to bake but is well worth it).  I don't always go there to eat, but I end up smelling the food and at least order something to go most nights I'm there.  While everything I've had has been good, I would definitely recommend the gourmet pizzas before anything else.  (The Thai Chicken is definitely worth your time.)  I wouldn't recommend delivery but instead order take-out ahead of time.  Or go for a beer while you wait for your food.   Don't forget to check out the downstairs bar, known as the Railsplitter Speakeasy.  It's got a different vibe than the upstairs bar which can feel a bit more divey and crowded.  The Railsplitter has a more cozy feel and I find it a better atmosphere for enjoying a good craft beer.  (If it was up to me, the whole place would look and feel like the Railsplitter.)  I get some of the complaints, but on several of my own visits to Caliente, I find the problem is with the clientele.  In other words, people go in for a beer and then don't know what to do when they can't get a Bud Light.  These are the people who can ruin a good night for an otherwise great server.    Just remember if you're thinking about checking it out it's called Caliente PIZZA and DRAFT House.  And if you enjoy a great beer and a perfect slice, buy the crew a 6-pack as a thank you.",

    "text": "Met up at Caliente's with a social group that I belong to yesterday after work for \"drinking practice\".  I must say that I was very impressed with the selection of beers on tap. It's a rarity for me to find a bar that has quality craft beers on tap that I have not yet tried or haven't had in a long time. Caliente's sure did deliver in that respect.   I started out having a long time favorite of mine, Bell's Third Coast Old Ale. It was correctly served in sniffer glass and it went down just right. I followed it up with the Brew Gentleman's Mammoth, then a Bullfrog Blackberry JuJu, a Draai Laag Yodeler, Lost Abbey Lost and Found, a Free Will Barbera Grape and finished the evening off with a Dogfish Head Raison D Extra. Nice selection of beers eh? I think so. And the best part about it was that most of the brews were consumed during happy hour meaning that they only cost me $3.50 each!  We started our \"drinking practice\" on the first floor of Caliente's then as our group grew to double digits we took it down stairs. Both locations were comfortable and accommodating yet distinctly different from one another. The first floor had a more \"old skool\", traditional Pittsburgh pub feel to it contrasting with the metro kind of lounge atmosphere of the basement. It was like bar hopping without the benefit of enjoying every one of those February 8 degrees that we were blessed with outside yesterday evening  I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the pizza at Caliente's. The group I was with ordered a number of pizzas and I had the opportunity to enjoy a few slices of the Meat Lover's pizza and a few slices of a BBQ Chicken with Pineapple pizza. They were both delicious and could stand toe to toe with just about any Italian pie in the Burgh.   I can't say enough good things about this place. If you appreciate good craft beers and enjoy Pizza, this is the place for you. If I lived a little closer to Bloomfield, I would most certainly be a regular of Caliente's.",

I gave it 10 minutes until I decided to leave, even as I was getting up from the barstool, a bartender walked past me without a care in the world.

The burger was nice and big, made sure it filled the bun. Topped with the usual lettuce, tomato and onion. Bigger than burgers you may find at other places in the city. I ordered fries as my side and was not disappointed with them. Nice size portion for the price. They had some type of coating on them that made them a little more crunchy than what you would find at any fast food place.  Deliver is through GrubHub, so a fee does apply (this fee varies on the place you order from, from what I have noticed).",

It was actually delivered in a pizza box.  It has lots of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, plus some Italian meats.  The bread part of the calzone was very good.  The buffalo chicken salad was also a quite generous portion and was exactly as described:  mixed greens (arugula, baby spinach, etc.), red onion, green bell pepper, french fries, grilled chicken tossed w/ buffalo hot sauce and cheddar cheese.  I got the homemade ranch dressing and it was really good.    I thought given the portion size, the freshness of the ingredients, and the fact that the calzone was made from scratch (the dough, sauce, etc.) it was reasonable.

    "text": "I have bee nmeaning to review Caliente for a long time now. I has been my boozer of choice since I moved to Bloomfield almost a year and a half ago. It was actually one of the first local businesses I patronized following my move.  The bar is small. A few seats and tables with a larger raised section at the back. The space is small and the bodies pack in during peak hours. The big focal point, besides the myriad of beer signs from over a hundred different breweries from around the nation and globe, are the chalk walls. The first holds the draft list and usually a cool piece of seasonal chalk art. The back wall has a very VERY cool piece of chalk art depicting the storefront and surrounding buildings on Liberty Ave.  The service is usually top notch. I tend to go on Tuesdays (cause I am a secret karaoke whore) and see Angie. Angie is a peach. Always quick with a smile and a drink. On a side note she was also first runner up for a best bartender in the Burgh competition this past year. There is a small downside though. The management seems to never schedule an appropriate amount of staff, so during volume you can face a bit of a wait, unless you become a regular, then you get taken care of.  The food here is bombtastic to boot. Pizzas are incredible, my favorite being the spinach and feta. My all time favorite item on the menu is the Italian Sub. The col cuts are great, the cheese is awesome, the veggies are fresh and crisp and it is all contained by a chewy crusty sub roll. Also, kitchen is open till 2 so big plus for me.  The biggest reason I love Caliente is their beer selection. To have one of the biggest and most eclectic selections in all of Pittsburgh and literal stumble (long story involving way too much North Coast Old Rasputin and Fireball) from my front door is truly a double edged sword. The bar features about 20 constantly rotating taps with the worst beer being Yuengling. They also have a very nice bottle selection to boot. The beers come in appropriate glassware, which is unique. Most bars have pints and maybe snifters but Caliente had pislners, snifters, tulips, and goblets. The only drawback is that I find the drafts to be a little over priced.  Like the Toby Keith song, I love this bar. It is quick, convenient, and fun. It only loses a star for being a hair overpriced and understaffed. Neither of these will keep me from going back again and again.",

I think it's a mistake that they put the ranch on top because it cools down the pizza too much.  We live ten minutes away and it was room temperature by the time we got it home.

The last time I stupidly waited the extra hour for my food to show up cold and mushy.  This time I had the good sense to call and cancel it.  Never again Caliente.",

He loved Caliente and so did I. This is your a-typical dive bar with really good drinks, an excellent beer menu and pizza that's well, to die for. They've actually won national pizza contests, something that is abundantly clear upon your first bite.   Service is friendly and attentive with prices that are more than reasonable. I also love the Pittsburgh themed wall murals painted throughout the back room. Hell, I even kind of liked the cramped men's room with partially revealing stall door.   Leaving Pittsburgh this time was bittersweet. I'll miss vising my son there and a few really great places to eat and drink. Of these, Caliente was definitely a favorite. Just wish it wasn't a 7 hour drive away.",

The food has always been good. I loveeee their pizza sauce, especially with banana peppers and sausage.  I have a few qualms, though, and I feel like they can be pretty easy fixes (maybe).  1. I used to always order buffalo shrimp salad and they were always out of the buffalo shrimp so I had to settle for buffalo chicken -_-. I've since stopped ordering it, so I'm not sure if that ever panned out. 2. I have had multiple occasions where we will order something, go to pick it up, and it's not ready - not only is it not ready, they haven't even started to make it. One time, I ordered pick up, and they ... delivered it (they already had my address on file, lol oops). 3. The service is hit or miss. I do love sitting at the bar though, they are very attentive. 4. This is such a privileged thing to complain about and I'm so sorry, but if you order a pepperoni pizza, you better really love pepperoni because the whole pizza will be COVERED in pepperoni. It leaves it very greasy but admittedly, pretty tasty.  Again, I love Caliente's food... there are just little things that I think we should all be aware of :)",

Theme:  Hipster pizza    In my head, this place was going to be so packed that I wasn't going to be able to find a seat.  To my surprise, there was a few open tables so we sat down immediately.    The beer list is quite extensive.  They have a wide variety of styles.  I am an IPA drinker and a few options tickled my fancy.   We started to check out the menu and guess what?  it is happy hour  until 6:30.  Half off drafts and $5 personal pan pizzas with one topping.  Cha-ching.

Since then  it's all been down hill and I won't give it another chance.  Ordered delivery to a address about a mile away and it took an hour and half to arrive.  They claimed they could not find our house and turned around and took the order back without calling us.  I had to call the restaurant when it didn't arrive and they sent a second driver and he still stopped 8 houses down so I had to run through the rain to grab it.  Our street address is not difficult to find it is clearly marked and one house down from the corner.  The second time we ordered through GrubHub and it turns out they still use their own drivers and we also had issues.  Ordered at 04:40 and it took a hour and forty minutes to arrive on a Monday.  After an hour we called for a status update and they told us it had just left, but it still took them forty minutes to arrive.  The pizza was left on our doorstep in the rain with a note that the wrong number was left, even though it was placed through GrubHub who I've been contact by many times without problems.  The pizza was cold of course, the buffalo fries were normal (sad looking) fries and they did not include ranch that was a extra charge.    I just feel they are not honest about what is going on with your order and cannot make simple deliveries within a 4 minute drive.",

    "text": "Great, cheap pizza.. Definitely nothing to write home about, but my plain 18\" pie was less than $9 for takeout. The pizza itself tasted good - light on the sauce and heavy on the cheese, and the crust was excellent for your basic American-style pizza. Most of the menu is under $10 for pasta, hoagies, etc, and they have some pretty good coupons as well. They appear to have some daily food and drink specials. Monday wing night and thursday burger night, and maybe a half-off pasta on wednesday.  Inside Caliente there is also a bar. Reasonably priced, the selection didn't seem out of this world but $4 Sarnac seasonals tied us over while we waited for our pizza to come out. We also got buffalo fries - which unfortunately were not as we imagined, the potato-based cousin of the wing, but rather a knock off of Buffalo Wild Wing's buffalo chips(thick-sliced potato chips with curly fry seasoning). Tasty, none-the-less, and sometimes thin enough that the edges were crispy like a chip, delicious!  All-in-all, just a neighborhood bar and pizza joint. If you're looking for a cheap pizza and you live around here, definitely give them a call.",

There is better pizza in the area, but I would still rate the pizza slightly above average.  The crust is a little chewy, but the overall taste and toppings are good enough.  What sets this pizza place apart from others is the beer list.  You can walk in at any time and get 1-2 drafts that would be hard to find at other places.",

    "text": "I went here with a friend last night and was surprised by the experience that I had. First of all, if you're advertising your restaurant as a pizza place, you have to have great pizza.... bottom line. And unfortunately, I think that the pizza was the worst part of my entire experience here.  I walked in and sat down with a friend for dinner.I had a Groupon and was eager to use it- but I unfortunately had heard that this place was a little below par, so my expectations weren't very high. However, I was surprised, almost floored, at the variety and diversity of craft beers- good for you guys! The waiter, who was actually a really nice guy and great, offered to give me a taste of anything and I tried the chocolate stout- mmmmmhmmm. I ended up getting the night special of a 22oz average beer for either 4 or 5 bucks, but enjoyed the menu nonetheless.  And the food.... the food was actually pretty damn good. I had to spend 25 bucks for the Groupon, so we got a smorgasbord of bar food: onion rings, breadsticks, and a pizza. The waiter was even nice enough to come back and say we had enough money on the Groupon to get fries too- so we did just that (all of this for $25!) . The fries were average, but the onion rings and breadsticks were amazing. Good service, very little wait time. However, ironically the pizza left a lot to be desired.  Overall though, a tasty and fun little night. This place was a nice little hole in the wall in a small space right on Liberty, and I probably would go back again.",

But if you get here early and stay through \"the game\", you're sure to have a good time!!",

    "text": "Okay, I came to this place a lot for karaoke last year. It was fun cause I could take off my shirt and stuff and no one cared. They also had bar bingo which was a sure fire way to get drunk for under $15.  Recently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \"bar pizza\". Pizza that is doey and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the day there is nothing special or redeeming about it. Think of Pizza Hut or frozen pizza you may purchase at a grocery store. I gave the pizza another try. Perhaps I was wrong. No, it was the same doey, bar pizza. Not amazing by any standards. I asked the pizza mAker about the inspiration behind their pizza, his response \"I don't know... My mom bought a lot of tombstone when we were kids\". Aside from this pizza with a bad personality, the beer is way over priced, they don't even serve straub or pbr. The bartender told me they \"we're trying to get rid of that crowd\". The crowd however added to the subpar experience. The best I can describe it is Bloomfield's jersey shore.  In conclusion, if you wanna eat wack pizza, pay to much for beer while being surrounded by douches Caliente  is the place for you! The best thing this place can offer is they DO serve pizza till 2 pm.",

    "text": "After my two very different dining experiences at Caliente, I believe that I have a fair picture of the establishment. If you're thinking about trying Caliente, my advice is to avoid ordering takeout or delivery at all costs, and always opt for dining in.   Why not delivery, you ask? I tried ordering a pizza for delivery around 7pm on a Friday night before going out with some friends. The delivery was sent to my friend's apartment, which was only a few blocks away from the restaurant's Bloomfield location. Understandably, I expected a considerable wait due to the fact that it was during a busy time: the estimated delivery time was 30 minutes. However, I was disappointed when after an hour the delivery was nowhere to be found. Not only was I frustrated, but my friends were too because this pizza was holding up our plans. When I attempted calling the restaurant, I was told the order was \"on its way\" and that the driver was very busy. After another 45 minutes, I called again and got the same response. Everyone was getting more and more impatient, and I was wondering if it wasn't too late to cancel the order. When the pizza finally arrived over 2 hours later, it was room temperature- although I have to admit it was delicious despite the fact. The delivery took over four times longer than expected, which ruined the plans for the night.   I was willing to give Caliente another chance, so recently I went to the restaurant with a group of friends late on a Saturday night, around 1am. The experience was much more positive, because the food was ready in a reasonable time, even though my party was quite large. The pizza was fresh out of the oven and was fantastic. Our server was friendly. So if you want fresh, tasty pizza, please go to their restaurant- I highly recommend it for a late night snack! Just learn from my mistakes, and don't order delivery.",

The atmosphere is much of what you would expect from a bar.  People jabbering away and TV's in the background with sports, all standard good stuff.  The decor is in the process of changing with the new owners, more cool stuff on the wall and the addition of the chalkboard paint listing all the tap brews (all 20) is really cool.  What makes Caliente welcoming is the staff, none of who I have ever had an issue with... From the handy man to the owners, they know how to treat patrons.  As for the food, it is pretty damn good.  The pizza is, in my opinion, the best in Bloomfield.  It is obvious that they use fresh ingredients, many of which I believe are local.  The wings are solid and the sandwiches are put on superb bread, which I think makes or breaks most sandwiches.  Drinking!  If you like craft beer then Caliente is your place to go in Bloomfield... The selection on tap is fantastic with Hercules Double IPA, Raging Bitch Belgium IPA and Dogfish Head Burton and Baton only to name a few... There is 20 on tap in total and one will not find a miller lite or bud light in the mix... IF you prefer bottles, well they have two full coolers full of craft brews, including my personal favorite, Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA...  And for you hipsters, they most certainly have Pabst Blue Ribbon available...  You can't go wrong with Caliente.",

We got no askew looks for requesting the Kay Kombo, and with beverages and tip, our total was still less than 20 dollars.  On the atmosphere tack,  I have no idea what Caliente becomes like as the night grinds forward, but when we visited around 5PM, the bar was rather quiet and calm, and Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations was on the telly. Having written that, I feel that Caliente was a pleasant, inexpensive choice for a payday Friday night dinner, and I think you will also if you visit.   P.S.

    "text": "Finally, a pizza place worth raving about in Pittsburgh!  So Caliente looks like a typical bar from the outside but the inside seems like it's in limbo between bar and restaurant.  The menus are takeout menus - what?  Yeah, this got my expectations really low but when the food came out I was pleasantly surprised.  The Caesar Salad was nice and big and the dressing automatically came on the side.  The garlic bread (only 99 cents!) was delicious with just the right amount of crunch.  The personal pepperoni pizza had all the things I look for in a pizza - just enough grease, great amount of toppings, and not too much crust.  The pesto pasta also didn't come out dripping in oil - very hard to find.    I will be coming back or ordering from here whenever I get my pizza cravings.  They deliver to Shadyside!  Seriously, give it a try.  Great value.",

Whenever I got waited on I asked about the special release the waitress told me she had none which I was fine with. So my party all picked out a good amount of pricey bottles from the fridge to take home. Whenever we went back to the bar a new customer asked about the same special beer release I asked about and she told him that they had two left. Not only did they lie but were also very rude when I questioned them about it. Will not be stopping in again.",

The server immediately took our Beverage orders as soon as we say down. Once everyone showed up he quickly took our food orders. We ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese and it was really good. The crust was perfect, the sauce tasted homemade and had a perfect flavor texture to it and the pepperoni and cheese were just right. We also got a ranchero steak sub and it was amazing. Great steak, Fresh cut French fries, and ranch dressing. The bread was perfectly toasted and the steak was very flavorful. Everyone else in our group enjoyed their food as well. The server was outstanding all night long. We will be back to this place for sure.",

    "text": "Alright, I have to level with you - I'm giving Caliente a 5 star rating, but it's for a combo of above-average 'bar food' AND the fastest delivery in Bloomfield, hands-down. (Who enjoys waiting an hour and a half for food?! When ya hungry, ya hungry!)  Thus far, I've sampled: chicken tenders (delish), popcorn chicken (okay, but more crispy breading than meat), onion rings (the best!), white pizza (solid, not as good as Angelo's, but you can add ricotta), regular pizza (good), mozzarella sticks (decent), chicken parm with pasta (the chicken is diced up and kinda mixed with the pasta, which is different, but still good), and -- duhn, duhn, duhhhn -- the gyro.   I have to elaborate on this one, because I was kinda shocked by how good their gyro was! They toast the pita, so it has a satisfying crunch to it, which I appreciate. They deliver it with the cucumber sauce (decent, but not Mike & Tony's) on the side so ish doesn't get soggy -- a plus in my book -- and the right amount of lettuce, tomato, and red onion comes on the luscious lamb. We've ordered the gyro about five times now, and have never been disappointed!   On top of all that, the food is usually delivered within 20-30 minutes. How awesome is that? I mean, when you call and order delivery, it's because you are hungry and, in my case, too lazy to put shoes on and drive to Wendy's. Caliente always comes through for me here. In fact, last night, they delivered our food in FIFTEEN minutes! That's cray-cray. Unheard of. Usually, food delivery peeps seem to like to flaunt their power over you. \"You're hungry? We have food. Yeah, you want our food?... Well, ya gotta wait!\" Not Caliente. They're quick, pleasant, and they take credit cards over the phone, so you don't have to have cash either. :)",

I went for a birthday party in the downstairs room and found the place to be lots of fun.  A bunch of us filled up the entire downstairs, so we pretty much had the bartender two ourselves.  The bartender was really nice and served everyone quickly, remembering everyone's drinks.  The beer selection was fantastic, especially for a random bar in Bloomfield. The food was pretty good and not greasy.  I'll for sure be back from a trivia night.  Only drawback is that only the (kinda gross) women's restroom is on the first floor, rather than the basement.",

Was a little late but not overly.  I got a large pizza ($12.99) with red onions. The pizza was pretty small for a large and I got it at room temperature. You know, when pizzas been sitting out for a while and the cheese turns into a hard gummy layer.  But let me tell you, as for the onions, at $2.59 for a toddlers handful of unrecognizable crisps, I got screwed. My girlfriend actually had to ask me what the heck was on the pizza, she really couldn't tell. Sad!  I also got the \"broccoli puffs\". For $5.49 I got 5 pieces, half of them crushed. Tried to pick one up with my fingers and it just fell apart. I ate one, my girlfriend had a bite and we threw the rest away. The marinara they came with took up more space than they did.   Like I said, I have never in my life felt the need to take time out of my day to review a restaurant, but this place sucks. The judges at that \"World Pizza Expo\" they always champion must have all been drunk, or dogs. Stay away.",

The food was properly cooked, fresh and tasty . I will definitely come back here again and again .  Thanks Joe!",

Their pizza is consistently delicious with generous toppings. Their salads are made with lettuce that contains actual nutrients (aka not iceberg) and their ranch dressing is home made.  The buffalo chicken rolls and bread are favorites amongst coworkers.    I personally really enjoy the spinach and feta rolls for myself.  For those dining in, they have a top notch craft beer selection that is always changing based on the seasons.   Their prices are very fair based on the ingredients they use.  If you're getting delivery, you don't have to spend an arm and a leg for a minimum.  I believe it's like $8 or something.  They're also one of the few places in the area open late for delivery.",

No one offered a drink on the house or a compensation for the rolls until we took a bite and they were raw. It took raw rolls and an extra twenty minute of our evening for them to remove the rolls from the bill. They could tell we were unhappy but didn't even show any type of concern.

Super cozy and it was practically empty except for three guys at the bar and the bartender (also our server). To hurry things along in your quest for food, I will include my review of that first.  The food and beer saved this review. The honey siracha wings are to die for, and the luau gourmet pizza is really good also. The first thing I noticed was the crust - thick and fluffy on the inside, but a nice crisp outside. Lots of food options to choose from on the menu and at a decent price. Their beer list also has plenty to choose from and several really tasty ones. I wanted to try them all!   The service: Our waitress first approached our table seeming very annoyed that we had chosen to sit downstairs. Every time she visited our table she was very unpleasant. We did NOT feel welcome. Once she was back behind the bar, she would be smiling and twirling her hair in front of the three guys. Perhaps next time I will order Caliente through Grubhub.",

    "text": "Don't ever order delivery from Caliente.  They just lost my business and the department I work for - business.  We called at 6:10 to place an order for 3 extra large pizzas.  It took 20+ minutes to even place the order because whoever was doing it did not know what they were doing. They asked for the address 3 times, the phone number twice, and what the order was at least twice. However - I was told the pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes.  Fantastic.    Well - I finally call at 7:15 to find out where my order is - cause it's been almost an hour.  Turns out - they wrote the wrong phone number down - and didn't bother coming to the building.  I sat in the lobby of the hospital for 30 minutes - wasting time - waiting.  They re-delivered the pizza - but it took another 20 minutes.  Another 20 minutes?!  I swear he walked, cause no cars pulled up.    After over an hour of wasted time and not even an apology when I called (I was scolded for not answering the phone).  It's not worth it to waste our money there.    Did I mention the pizza was cold when it was delivered?  Not even warm.  Cold.    Tread carefully.",

    "text": "I spent the entire day looking forward to TV and pizza night. When I got off work I ordered a big \"Porky's Revenge\" pizza for delivery so that I wouldn't have to wait long for it after getting home.   I got home, booted up the DVR and turned on Big Brother which, by the way, can you believe that Sam almost nominated JC? What the hell is she thinking? She's gonna screw her whole game.   As soon as I started the show, my pizza arrived which was perfect timing. Unfortunately it was the wrong pizza. I was dissapointed but no big deal. I was mildly inconvenienced. It was mildly inconvenient.   Big Brother was ending, I was watching Rock Star cry about going up, and my replacement pizza still wasn't here. No sweat, I still have multiple shows to watch. I kick on the last episode of Cloak and Dagger that I missed. It was good. You should watch that show. So it ends and my tv and pizza night is still missing it's pizza. the next show that I planned on watching was the new Gordon Ramsay show where he makes over kitchens and restaurants and I don't want to watch that without my pizza.   So I call up the restaurant and it turns out there was a misunderstanding. I'm not sure what happened but I'll take the blame and say that I didn't make it 100% clear that I wanted a replacement. The pizza was going to be paid for in cash so there had been no money exchange yet.  Matt gets his ass on the phone and says verbatim \"Jason. I'm going to save your pizza night no matter what it takes, but in like 30 min because that's how long it takes to make this pizza and get it to where you are.\"  No sweat. I still have the Gordon Ramsay show to watch, but I kind of want to wait for the pizza so I turn on an episode of Catfish. Don't judge me. Don't. There aren't like a ton of shows this time of year and you know what... I don't have to defend myself for this.   About 27.5 min later a beam of light filled my living room and I heard the majestic sound of the original NES version of the theme from Kirby's Dream Land which is my ring tone. Fast forward about 2 minutes and I had a pizza and got to watch Gordon Ramsay save a restaurant that let's dogs in it.   Thanks Matt for saving my pizza and TV night. I ate all but two slices and I'm not ashamed.",

It's not that the bartenders and servers are bad - they're all lovely - it's that whomever is scheduling them is horrific at their job .Constantly understaffed. If you're running specials everynight and draw a moderate to full crowd, you need more than one person. The staff is apologetic about it and it's not enough to keep me away but holy crap man, take some burden off your employees for god's sake.  Last four times I have been the wait times for service have been on the absurd side, you're doing nobody a favor here.  ------  Cannot believe I've waited so long to go here, kicking myself for wasting time with the smaller pizzerias (no offense).  Went on a Sunday, great specials on the pizza. I think it was 13 dollars for an XL pizza and you get four toppings for free. The pizza was delicious, went with spinach, feta two times, and ricotta, nice greek pizza. Got a side of fries which were quite tasty and fairly priced, big portion too.  GREAT beer selection, server knew her stuff and suggested a peanut butter porter which was phenomenal.   Cool place too, lots of TVs and seating. They have good specials every night on food and booze, will definitely be making Sunday nights pizza night now.",

    "text": "Whenever I go to a new city, beer and wine spots are the first things I look for. I happened to stumble across Caliente Pizza by accident while searching for a winery. It popped up on google maps and I was like pizza AND draft beers - hello heaven. I clicked on the link and was immediately drawn in by the draft list. It was beautiful. Then I saw a picture of the pizza and I was sold. I like to pride myself in being a self proclaimed pizza connoisseur and my husband loves beer so we knew we had to try this place. I sent them a tweet in my excitement and they replied to me a few hours later seeming equally as excited (I love when places interact with their customers on social media!) So we show up on a Friday night and the place is packed, but we expected it. It's Friday and they had a special flight night going on. We get seated within a few minutes in the downstairs basement area that has another bar and some TVs. It was great. I ordered a half cheese and half pepperoni pizza (I like to judge a pizza place by how well they can do a basic style) and my husband got a steak calzone. My pizza was pretty good, but the crust was a little lacking in flavor so I asked for a side of ranch dressing, which is house made and fantastic, and BAM that pizza was perfect. Now, pizza and ranch may not be your thing but seriously try it. My husband's calzone took a little longer than we would have liked but again it was a busy Friday night and calzones take longer to cook by nature so he just kept chugging along with his flight of beer and stole a few bites of my pizza. All was well.  The best part is that one of the owners saw my check-in/tweet about being at Caliente and stopped by our table to ask how everything was. HOW IS THAT FOR SERVICE? Angie was a sweetheart and Caliente pizza will be a MUST STOP place for us anytime we are in Pittsburgh.",

We ordered their buffalo chicken pizza and it was barely edible. Way too hot!. A sauce is meant to enhance the flavor, not numb your mouth. Nobody warned us that their buffalo sauce could wake up a mummy, and they should have. Last, service was slow.  Overall, not a great experience so they won't see us again.",

    "text": "I will never order another pizza from Caliente ever again.   Tonight I decided to use my \"credit\" for my botched pizza from my last review. Apparently wrong thing to do. So they told me the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes. Ordered this at 1218. I don't get any calls from Caliente about my delivery or that the driver is even outside. All I get is a knock on the door but by the time I get outside no ones there.   It's 130 I call for my pizza.  At this point after 3 undercooked pizzas and an undelivered one what can I say I'm pissed. Not only do I get yelled after asking for a refund for the credited pizza as well what I ordered on this ordered he tells me I don't deserve the refund (from apparently \"2 weeks ago\" he says I'm pretty sure it has only been 5 days let me check my Yelp records) for the credited pizza I never received. By the way everyone this is coming from the exact same person who botched the order from the last review. Now hes saying that he didn't even make a mistake on the last one after he owned up to everything in the last review. Um. What? Im over it.   I speak to the manager who apparently likes to let his employees yell at people over the phone and tell him I want everything refunded and that no I don't want a free pizza. I don't care if he makes it and that all I want is an apology from his employee for yelling at me telling me guess what I'M WRONG. Even the manager doesn't think I deserve an apology.  Caliente heres a few lessons for you: 1. Employees need to show professionalism regardless of how annoyed, rude, pissed, off a customer is. There is no back and forth. 2. Hanging up on customers too is a no go. 3. Learn how to make a pizza. The pizza that you were probably going to give me this time was probably undercooked too.  Time to start ordering from GIovannis at least their pizzas are consistent.",

It's a smaller place, but the dark lighting and appearance of the place definitely make it a pretty relaxed setting. They have TVs and there's always music playing.   As far as the food goes, the pepperoni rolls are my absolute favorite. They offer food specials nightly, and the personal pizza for $5 is always a good go-to. The beer selection and draft list seem to always be updated when my group stops in, and they've hosted plenty of events with different featured beers.   it seems like a lot of people are starting to find out about the new ownership of this place. That's really great for business, but it seems to be making it much more crowded on any day of the week. Plan for some extra time for the kitchen/servers to catch up.   Lastly, the prices. They aren't out of the norm by any means.  For me, this is a gem of Bloomfield and definitely one of my favorite places to visit in the burgh.",

    "text": "One star is just for the ability to post this...I wish I had read some of the other delivery reviews prior to ordering, but Caliente had messed up my orders in small ways twice in the past. The first they forgot my dressing and one of the minor vegetables was missing from my salad. I could overlook it. The second time I ordered the delivery was beyond the estimated wait time. This time, I waited 10 minutes beyond the estimated delivery time to call the restaurant to ask where the food was. They purposely picked up the phone and hung it up on me three or four times. When a girl with a bad attitude finally picked up they told me my order was out for delivery, and it wasn't, because it took another 20 minutes to get to me (1.5hrs later), and I live less than 5 minutes away! When I finally went to meet the delivery boy he seemed under the influence of something...slurred, slow speech, and delayed response time. What he gave me did not seem to be all of the food, and I told him to wait...sure enough one of my items was completely missing, and when I brought the rest in, it was cold as ice, and completely unenjoyable. I am now waiting for the rest of it to show up, but I'm doubtful I will see it because he assured me they 'were closing early' tonight. I'll never order from them again. Absolutely terrible customer service, and cold, missing food certainly isn't what anyone orders for. Plenty of other good delivery places to try in the same area , I'm sure. They need to get their acts together. It's embarassing.",

I usually don't like that much but it was nicely cooked and not burnt like it can sometimes be. The person at the booth was fun. Ran inside to use the restroom...atmosphere is a little dark/duvet/hipsters/small but it worked. I would go again when in the area but wouldn't make a special trip. Cheers!",

Personally, I think they do their best work with the classics-- cheese, pepperoni, breadsticks.   The Grandma Ruffa pizza is also amazing. It's drizzled with olive oil and topped with red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, and basil.",

Can't remember his name though ):   We ordered cheesy bread, which came out basically the size of a pizza for a lot cheaper. We also got buffalo fries with ranch. There isn't a strong buffalo taste, which was a little disappointing. It's a buffalo powder that they sprinkle on top. Next time I'm definitely gonna ask for more of the seasoning. Food was decently priced for the amount that came out. Cheesy bread was AWESOME. We got regular cheesy bread initially, but stayed for a while and ended up ordering the buffalo chicken cheesy bread. I like buffalo, can you tell?  The buffalo chicken cheesy bread was really good, I was surprised I liked it so much. Good amount of buffalo on this. It was something different to try, but I still think I'm gonna stick to the original cheesy bread next time.  We also ordered drinks. My friend ordered a rum and coke pitcher which was on special that night. It was a small personal pitcher.. don't expect to share! Definitely portioned for one person.   I ordered an IPA, but wasn't a fan of it. The bartender could tell. I wasn't going to say anything, and just finish the drink and order something different but he came over and placed a sample glass in front of me and said \"try this instead\". Much better IPA. He poured me a glass of this instead. I wonder if a lot of people don't like this particular beer? I can't quite remember the names of them, but it was really cool that he offered me a different one. Not too often you get this level of customer service.   Definitely will be back soon.",

Caliente has a pie for every palate, from your standard cheese to the Quack Attack (my choice this trip) which is topped with pan seared duck, wild mushrooms, baby arugula, cherry tomatoes, and finished with truffle garlic oil. It's crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside crust was some of the best I've ever had, but at $33 for 9 slices (which was split between 2 hungry mouths), I'd like to see a bit more duck. Overall, I highly recommend it, but it's more of a splurge than a go-to.  What makes every pizza better? Beer of course! If you're looking for hard to find, or highly sought-after craft brews, Caliente is the place to go. At $8-12 for a snifter of their some of the heavy hitters, the bill can add up fast, so I suggest getting half-price drafts during happy hour if you're looking to indulge.",

Well.... We were really shocked that all of their utensils and plates were plastic (and non-recyclable). It is 2018-we should be using real plates or bio-degradable disposables. When I got a plastic cup for my water I instantly felt like I was in a college bar expecting my shoes to stick to the floor. (Thankfully, they did not.) The wine glass was actually glass. Before ordering anything, we ordered cheesy breadsticks. I would love to tell you how good they were, however, we never got them. We got all of our main meal items first. We asked about the breadsticks and she said they would be out soon. Well, once we were done with our meal, we told her not to bring them. She said they were ready. No, we are done. They were to be appetizers, not dessert. We ordered a grandma pizza, boneless wings, and french fries. Everything was really good. Although, the grandma pizza was a little too thick! We'll go with a thinner crust next time. Speaking of next time, we'll order food to go perhaps, but not for there. I didn't like the price point combined with the plastic plates. Also, the forks and knives and napkins are on the table ahead of time. I was a bit worried about cleanliness (I know my hand touched other forks while retrieving ours.) If I eat at home, I can use re-usable plates and cutlery and enjoy all of the food we order.  Service was average. She really seemed to be pre-occupied.",

Caliente offers daily food and drink specials and happy hour deals.  You can't beat half off craft drafts during happy hour!  So why three stars?  Each time I've been there, they typically only have a manager on staff and a bartender who is doubling as a waitress for the whole place.  The staff is always friendly, but for-sure overworked.  Don't expect to come in here and get out quick, and you may wait in between drinks longer than you'd like.  They offer special events, like karaoke, live music, and trivia night.  Hope to check those out in the future!",

Our server had two deuces (including us), one four top, and one guy at the bar. She spent the entire two hours we were there with an earbud in staring at her phone.

    "text": "NEVER ORDER DELIVERY. This is the second time we ordered pizza for delivery from Caliente. This is also the second time we waited for 2 hours for our pizza to arrive and it arrived cold. We live less than 10 minutes away from the restaurant, probably closer to 5 minutes. Both times we called after an hour and a half and they told us \"it is out for delivery now\". We will never order from here again. The pizza is not cheap and to wait two hours for a cold pizza is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the pizza is really delicious when you go to the actual restaurant. Extremely disappointed.",

Especially the buffalo chicken sandwich..don't waste your money.  It is truly a PIZZA AND DRAFT place.    One of the only places around that will serve food until 2am however!",

Came last night with a friend and she ordered a veggie burger, provolone sticks and I ordered simple pepperoni rolls. 30 minutes after giving our order the waiter came out and said they don't have veggie burgers. It would have been helpful to know that ahead of time. So my friend got her provolone sticks about 20 minutes after that and I was still left waiting for my pepperoni rolls. It's now an hour and I finally get my Pepperoni rolls . Again food is great but kitchen management needs to be worked on. Last time I went there their special cupcakes advertised on the menu weren't available either. Please update you menu as well .",

The parking sucks, but that's every place in Bloomfield, and it was easy to find. My wife and me took our 3 kids and my only gripe is we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table, then again it was a Saturday night. The dining area should be way bigger. But the food was great. The breadsticks with homemade ranch were awesome and the Broccoli Puffs were amazing. We had a Pepperoni pizza and a Meat Lovers Pizza and they were both great. Good crust, lots of toppings. My wife had a Buffalo Chicken salad and she loved it. I would highly recommend Caliente. Our waitress was really good too. Even without a Groupon we will definitely go back.",

On my last visit to this location tonight I ordered a steak pizza and my wife ordered wings both honey sirracha and garlic parm. First let me say the food order was placed at 1255 am and they are done serving food at 2am. Typically I have a rule of not ordering food an hour before the restaurant closes. However not many other options on a Tuesday night. The food came out of the kitchen at 120am. Typical time frame for wings and pizza. The order was to go so by time I got home at 130. I was ready to eat. Disappointment is all I can say. The pizza was stiff as if it was sitting back there from another order that may have gotten sent back hours prior and the wings where so where obviously over cooked and just thrown together as if the cook was in a hurry to go. 35 dollars wasted.",

Anything that contains pizza dough here is 10/10 - the stix and rolls, the the pizza, the calzones. They do this and they do it right. I would suggest a hoagie, any of the salads are average. This place always has an excellent draft list, so feel free to drop in for a nice microbrew.  I enjoyed the pepperoni rolls and pepperoni Bread. And the $5 personal pan pizza during happy hour also gains mad respect.  Their draft list is a great place to find rare microbrews from near and far.   The Staff Friendly but not the fastest.  The staff here is friendly and knowledgable but always a little slow. I won't hold it against them.  They do what they can.   The Ambience Regardless of time of day, this page is always a black hole of regret. Next level classic rock is always on the juke box.  They have some solid chalk art on the walls.

She obviously didn't want the business and made it very obvious.  She brought the items ordered and just placed them on the bar and yelled what was out.  We had to get our item each time.

Then I tried the other, after one glass that was out also.   Moving on to the food. We asked our waitress (who was nice but had friends at the next table so was less than attentive to us) what a good one would be. We were debating between fried zucchini and cheesy bread- well, we got both for some reason. We didn't order both, but because of the waitress paying attention to her friends I don't believe she was paying much attention to our order. Sadly, we didn't try the pizza after two appetizers.   I watched the waitress serve the table in front of us (that she knew) free drink after free drink, but couldn't remember to bring us napkins. It was mostly because she was socializing with her friends about getting high and reminiscing. I don't mind if you know people, but please give others the same service.   I asked for wine, they only had two reds and a white. I took the white, and then we decided to leave after that. We still had no napkins, or refills on water. Overall, the atmosphere is hot, small, and personally good if you know the workers. If you don't know the workers, you might be fucked.",

At the Caliente's in Bloomfield the food was ok...it was slightly better then what i ate in Castle Shannon. The pizza was still sort of blah and the toppings were probably the best part of the pizza. it's the kind of pizza where you don't want to eat the crust because it's just extra crappy dough.  The service was terrible. They had a huge party in the back and the front tables were filled and the girl manning the bar was supposed to be the waitress for everyone. It was laughable. The huge party in the back wasn't impromptu, so it was sort of appalling that they couldn't figure out scheduling for that.   Also, their featured beer of the month was sold out, and it was the first week of the month on a Saturday. Seriously? You are promoting something that is not even in stock?  It just makes you wonder what other poor management things are happening if this crap is bubbling to the surface.",

There was clearly confusion on who was waiting tables because the other bartender was like \"oh I she said she was taking his order\".

The last visit we tried the square, thick crust.  We even splurged for the 5-cheese specialty topping.  I will NEVER order anything but at Caliente again!  Yeah, a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  Then, the beer.  They have a ton of great, local beers on tap, as well as other not-so-local.  Caliente typically plays a large part in Pittsburgh Craft Beer week, which is really cool too.  I've immensely enjoyed the tap takeovers they've hosted as well.  Agree with some other reviewers that the service can sometimes be subpar.  Not that the staff isn't supremely nice, but the place is hard to navigate when crowded (which is often), and its not like the servers can make food cook any faster.  For how great the food I've had there is, I'm okay with taking down a few beers, chilling with my homies, and waiting a little extra time for a tasty pie.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with saying it was Not my first visit to Calienti's.    On Saturday, and I understand establishments were busy because of the Festival, what we experienced indicated a total disregard of a business to its customers. And that's why I'm writing this.   First of all the upstairs bar seemed to be short staffed and the bartenders not experienced nor motivated enough to keep up with the flow. People at the high tops were told that if they wanted a beer, they would have to wait for it at the bar. I saw $30 tabs being rung, and $2 tips. I wanted to jump in and return to my college day's job. Let me jump in. I'd have been thrilled to pour my customers beers. And I would not have had a $2 tip. I'd have made money!  I mean, what an opportunity to rock and roll. Totally lost.  Second, many of the beers had kicked and the excuse was \"we're too busy to put new ones on.\"  Hel-lo management!?!  Step up to the plate and help the staff to do what you want your bartenders to do. SELL Beer. Not to say, kicked, kicked and oh, that's kicked too. See where this is going?  Third and also disappointing. The bathroom at the bottom of the steps was deplorable, ladies room on the main floor has been out of service for what? A year? Mentioned to the one bartender about the disgusting bathroom and she said, \"do you mean from last night? Oh, we're too busy to take care of that.\"  And walked away!  Last but not least. There is a huge sign stating best happy hour in town. I agree that when its not \"all kicked\" there is a great selection of beers which I've enjoyed during happy hour as well as other times of the day. However, your competitors, and I know you know who they are, use 12-0z pours for the high octanes not 10-oz pours. The price is comparable but you get less.   Calienti's really missed a great opportunity to shine over this weekend. Those of us who go there will continue to do so, but for those people who may have stopped in for the first time?  As they say, you can only get one chance at a good first impression......",

Resting on the laurels of their \"Best Pizza in Pittsburgh\" label, they certainly don't carry a similar attention to detail when it comes to customer service. Twice now that I have ordered delivery online, the pizza has been late (really late, like 1.5-2 hours late). After speaking with the restaurant on the last order, I was given the line that \"we are told by our manager to tell you at delivery will be at least one hour.\"  What does that even mean? It's 2pm on a Monday, I highly doubt your staff is currently taxed with orders at this point. And really? It takes 2 hours to make and deliver a pizza? So there goes my first Yelp review, and unforunately, as much as I'd like to be a positive person - this place definitely grinds my gears.",

    "text": "REVIEW FOR Castle Shannon Blvd Location.  Imagine, if you will, planning a bridal shower for your future daughter in law. You take the reins on location and food, because of course, you have an establishment in mind that you always use. You book the party, send out the invites. You're confident you are gonna be the cool future mother in law. Then ten days before the event you find out the trusty go to place has been sold and the new owners will take over .... two days before the party. Not only that, they are completely redecorating. Under normal circumstances that would be a cause for panic and excessive drinking, possibly a minor temper tantrum and freak out, but that not happen when Caliente Pizza took over the old Pub and Pizza.  The owner Angela reached out to me before the event, and Lou (Marylou) made sure we communicated details and the transition went smoothly. I was treated wonderfully by the new owners almost as if they had known me  forever. She walked me through the menu planning and even saved me money by not letting me over order, assuring me that more food, if need was an order away.  The new improved, redecorated upstairs party room was awesome. I was super pleased at how fast it was done and loved the new look and floors. It was clean and refreshing.  Laurie was our server in charge and she did a spectacular job of keeping all drinks filled, tables cleared, food brought out in a timely manner. She was fun and positive. I liked Angela kept checking on things, too.  The food was above and beyond what I expected. The Broccoli puff were addictively delicious, the zucchini was crisp, tasty and perfect. I ordered the 'Ten for' hoagie platter and got a variety, the guest raved about them all, I particularly like the Italian hoagie. I wished I could have sampled them all. In addition I ordered pizzas. Three of them., Simply delicious with a sturdy crust, sweet chunky sauce and the right amount of toppings. The pizzas were such a hit, I had to order more. Oh, wait, did I mention the antipasta salad? Hello? Heaven in a bowl.  The staff and food is second to none and I highly recommend Caliente Pizza for private parties, catering and dining. I plan on having them be my new 'go to' place, and have already placed a catering order for an event in four weeks.  On a personal side note, I just want to thank Angela, Laurie and staff for going above and beyond to take care of my mom who had just gotten out of the hospital. They made her feel very welcome and catered to her special needs.",

Additionally,  they always forget the ranch...  If you love hot wings with ranch,  and don't have any ranch...  The wings become pointless.   Also, one of the 'grubhub' drivers isn't very nice.

We were there the week after PCBW and they were having their left over night. There were a bunch of oak aged selections which I loved. My big problem is their serving size. They sell many of their higher abv servings in baby size serving glasses. I find it tacky and insulting. Its a shady business tactic to serve less beer. I'm really disappointed in this practice and would not consider this a prime beer spot. I have never seen such a tiny serving glass.   The pizza was decent. There was nothing extraordinary about the food but it was fresh. We wanted to go and try their first place, pan pizza. We ordered this and a few of our friends ordered a different type of pizza. It took the staff 45 minutes to inform us that they were out of the pan pizza. Our fiends got their pizza 5 minutes later. So we had to wait longer and watch them eat.  We were there around 6pm so it's not a late dinner. Things can run out, but don't take so stinking long to tell us! As much as I want to try this special pan pizza, and compare it to a real Chicago style, I'm not sure if I care to go back.",

    "text": "I'm a frequent visitor there.  The good:  - When they make the pizza right, it's top notch. No real complaints when its done right. That's why we go there. Like a lot of home made places though, they have their off nights.  - Chicken wings are good and the meal-a-tizers(aka appetizers...more on that below) are pretty good as a whole.  The bad:  - They have meal-a-tizers, not appetizers. Your appetizers likely won't come before you get your main meal, but after it. Sometimes it even comes at the same time. The whole point of apps are to get food for while you are waiting.  - Their men's bathroom is one of the worst bathrooms ever. Very very small and cramped.  - Can be a little pricey. XL pizza's got their prices raised $3 recently with no real explanation given and no increase in quality.  Parking is on street and they do deliver.",
