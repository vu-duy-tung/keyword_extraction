    "text": "The Last Straw...  I am always dragged to the steel Cactus on Walnut Street by my coworkers, I have tried my best to give this place a chance over the past year.  The men's bathroom door upstairs does not lock. The men's bathroom door downstairs will not stay shut. Very few times has there been hot water to wash your hands in the restroom and sometimes there is no water available at all. Not long ago  there  was a guy  with a bulldog  in the restaurant, one of my co-workers has a severe allergy  to pet dander  and we asked if we could be moved to a different table. After a few inquiries  it was revealed that that indeed was not a service dog  but it was a pet of one of the owners and he always had his dog in the dining rm. He was quite rude and disrespectful in a typical d-bag fashion. The employees were very apologetic. I wish he would have seen it again so I could have called the health department. All Summer Long there was a temporary cooling tube strung through the ceiling, it was discustingand always dripped condensation on the customers. The upstairs deck floor it's so filthy and disgusting it makes do you want to throw up. The retractable roof was never retracted all summer and there are several broken panels patched with plywood covered in black mold. Last spring only a couple of the heaters were working, and this past fall only 2 of the heaters worked and unsafe kerosene torpedo heaters were strewn around the deck. Last night we came in and the front door would not shut and we can see our breath all the way to the top of the stairs. The poor guy at the door was inside and had many sweatshirts and jackets on to try to stay warm. We tried to go upstairs and we're informed that it was closed. I mentioned that the reason why we enjoy the place is for the for the upstairs deck. An employee apologized and said that the pipes were frozen and it could not be opened. We all turned and walked back out the door. I will now only visit this establishment to do my own inspections and see if anything has changed. According to the employees I spoke with over the last year, they probably will not.",

We got there and after being told we could sit on the bar the bartender told us we couldn't sit there, when other costumers were sitting there. We decided to give it another try and sit on a high top to enjoy dinner. After a long wait the waitresses came and VERY rudely told us that the high top was reserved, when the whole place was empty and it didn't have a reserved sign. After that horrible service we decided to leave. There are so many better restaurant/bars to eat on that street with much better service. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.",

    "text": "We went here for brunch earlier today for a friend's birthday. I was very disappointed in the \"Bloody Mary bar\" I got my glass with ice and vodka and trekked over to the bar. There was tomato juice and  2 3-tiered stands with one bowl of lemons. Bacon strips were placed in cups and 6 or 8 different spices were at the end of the table. That was it. I assumed they were replenishing so I sat back down and waited a few minutes for the servers to bring out all the goodies from the missing spots on the tiers. After no one showed up, I asked the girls by the table if they were filling the empty spots and they said \"no, this is all we have. We ran out yesterday.\"  No olives, celery, hot sauces, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish. No celery?! Nothing fun but the bacon. All they had to offer was the lemons, bacon, and spices. By the way the spices were in jars and they only provided 1 spoon. You had to use that solo spoon for all of the options. I was bummed. 7$ was too much for that sad display. Why even offer a make your own Bloody Mary? I really should have skipped it and got a beer instead.  With that being said - our server was very friendly, we were seated quickly, food was tasty, and everyone else enjoyed their mimosas and beer.",

I will also usually have a Yinzerita. Beyond that, I'm not convinced. This particular visit, I felt as if my table was an annoyance for the server. I did not have iced water until after my appetizer was served. I had to ask a different server for menu's because mine was not response or anywhere to be found. I always give this place second chances and leave feeling truly disappointed. Great environment but mediocre, at best, entrees.",

    "text": "We had the lousiest night at the Steel Cactus in Shadyside recently.  We were at the restaurant with out-of-town guests who we brought to because we heard it was a great place for Mexican.  We had reservations for six at 7:30 on Sat. Aug. 20.  While we had heard it was Jam on Walnut night, nothing prepared us for the horrendous evening at the restaurant.  The staff allowed the bar crowd to take over the place, especially the top floor where we were seated.  Despite being seated in the back corner of the dining room, we had bar patrons leaning up against our chairs.  The noise level was atrocious!    But even more upsetting was the service.  Our drinks - now remind you we were dinner customers, not merely bar flies - were served in small plastic cups for the same price as the glasses to which we are accustomed.  Margaritas were not even rimmed in salt.    Appetizers: Our trio of sauces with tortilla chips was an embarrassment for the Steel Cactus.  Each ramekin was less than half filled.  We ordered Mexican street corn which while it appeared to have something on it, was incredibly tasteless.  And the cost for one ear of corn split into three....!!!  Ridiculous.  Our main dishes were just OK.  Perhaps because we were having a lousy time - not being able to hear, being jostled by bar customers infiltrating the dining area, and a totally inattentive waitress who took 20 minutes to bring us appetizer plates, forks, etc. - we could not really enjoy our food.  We couldn't wait to get out of there!  While I understand there was a big event in Shadyside, the Steel Cactus should have been prepared for it.  It's not the first time for a Shadyside event.  Perhaps because of this, everything was super subpar!  We attended Little Italy in Bloomfield the night before.  The establishments went over and above to put on a great night for their patrons.",

The drinks have been on the weaker side, and seem overpriced outside of happy hour.  I've had the margaritas, and they aren't as good as the ones at Mad Mex.  I believe they do offer free chips and salsa, and they haven't been remarkable.  I haven't ordered other food here, so I can't comment on its quality.  Obviously, the main draw here is the rooftop bar, which can be a fun place to hang out on weekend nights, and offers a nice view of Walnut Street.  Be forewarned, however, that it gets busy at these times.  For rooftop dining and drinks, I recommend BRGR in East Liberty, which offers a more relaxed atmosphere, and better food/drinks.  The Chinese restaurant across the street also has a rooftop deck, though I've never been there, so I can't offer an opinion.  Overall, not a place I'd go out of my way to patronize--there are many other places in Shadyside and East Liberty offering better drinks, service, and ambiance, and many better, more genuine Mexican places.",

    "text": "MUCH BETTER!  After yelping about a few awful experiences I'd had at Steel Cactus my friend and I were invited to come back and try the food again after they'd had some time to work out the kinks in the kitchen.    It was GORGEOUS outside (last Tuesday, pre hurricane) and we were seated under the new roof.  The atmosphere was very cool and there's a pretty rad fan they have going over the bar that kind of gives the deck a cozy industrial vibe.  Is that possible?  It might not be, all I know is it looked cool and I liked it.  When we were seated the table next to us was RAVING about their food, so much so I thought someone must have been rude to the waitress and was trying to make up for it or something, but then the I overheard the one girl say the fajitas changed her life, so at that point I was pretty much set on fajitas.  Our server, Alex, was really nice.  We started out with the chipotle salsa and chips.  I've NEVER had a salsa that tasted like that, and it was AWESOME.  It almost tasted like it was made from green tomatos or tomatillos.  It was somehow sour, and sweet at the same time w a kick from the chipotle.  I am pretty much obsessed with it.  Its so good I'm convinced it could cure cancer, and I swear after eating it my skin was clearer, my hair looked inexplicably awesome, and my dining companion was 50% more handsome.  This may also have been because I'd had a yinzerita.  Those things are fantastic, but one will get you wasted so be careful, it is a sipping tea!    The fajitas were excellent, the girl sitting to my left didn't lie!  The best part about the fajitas were the roasted red peppers that came with it.  My friend had the chicken enchiladas and he thought they were excellent.  They were pretty good.  The only thing about Steel Cactus is all the food is pretty salty, so you may want to go easy on the hot sauces so as not to overwhelm the food completely.  Otherwise, it was great.  The manager came out and told us about some of the changes the kitchen has made and they really have come a long way since opening weekend.  I look forward to going back.  Try the chipotle salsa!",

Another 40 MINUTES go by and my friend's chicken burrito is still not here. I asked for the manager because we were rightfully upset. The manager took 20 min to come to our table. This whole time NO ONE checked on us. We probably could've left and no one would notice if we wanted to. They finally brought my friends food - never any apology or anything -also her order was completely wrong and her rice was so hard she literally could not chew it. There was no way we were going to ask for another one because they are obviously incompetent at directions and we'd be there another 2 hours. No refill of her drink ever. Again, she was given no service to even eat her meal. The people next to us were pissed as well so it was obvious we weren't the only people unhappy here. The manager was around 24 and gave some excuses for the staff and kitchen but it was not crowded at all so idk what happens when they actually are crowded. This was the worst service and food and im never going back and neither are my group of friends. Need new staff/management asap.",

    "text": "Probably the worst Mexican I've had in Pittsburgh. The service was bad, they somehow didnt have normal silverware even though the place wasn't even busy (gave us plastic), they played bad music at way too high of a volume, and the food was terrible. I got the mahi mahi tacos and the fish was so fishy smelling and tasting (p.s. mahi mahi should not be fishy tasting) that the smell literally stuck to my hands till the next day. Plus stomach was not right all the next day and I'm convinced that it was because the fish was bad. Went with 2 other people and they also said the food was not good so I know that it wasn't just me. Overall just a bad experience and I will not be giving this place any more business. I would suggest you do the same unless you want your hands and breath to smell like dirty vag",

    "text": "After a very long night of drinking, me and my friends headed to Steel Cactus for the bloody mary bar and some delicious Mexican breakfast options. Upon sitting down at the rooftop bar, it seemed as though Steel Cactus was a bit hungover, too. Only one other seat in the whole place was filled, and it casted this eerie morning-after vibe across the bar.  We sat down and I ordered my much anticipated bloody mary and headed to the bloody mary bar, which had plenty of options for mixing into your drink. One thing I would have loved to see at the bloody mary bar was a freshly-grated pepper option, but the jar of lemon pepper had to suffice.   As I sipped my spicy bloody mary, I ordered the huevos rancheros which, upon arrival, were underwhelming. I wasn't as impressed with the enchilada sauce and i found the hard corn tortillas difficult to eat. Everything needed a bit more salt and pepper and copious amount of hot sauce. Seeing that I was extremely nauseous from my hangover, I could not finish my bloody mary or breakfast. The bloody mary was quite tasty and I really wish that I had been able to drink it but I was not in the right state to be drinking it.   I must say though, as this experience was rather unexceptional, our waitress was the kindest person and was very personable. Even when I asked for an extra plastic bag in case I puked in the car ride home, she never judged me one second!   Discalimer: Steel Cactus's to-go bags are NOT good for puking in the car. The bloody mary does taste just as good coming up as it does when it's going down (if you know what I mean).  Update: after my hangover subsided and I reheated my huevos rancheros in the microwave, they tasted much better. Perhaps Steel Cactus should nuke their food before serving it as well.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Mexican food, so I'm always on the lookout for restaurants like the Steel Cactus. Granted, I consider Steel Cactus a little lower on the quality scale than most other Mexican restaurants, but they have a great happy hour which my roommates and I frequent.   One of the things I really like about the Steel Cactus is the rooftop bar. This is such a fun place to be in the summertime, enjoying a fruity drink and looking out over Shadyside. As I mentioned, my roommates and I usually come for the happy hour, so I can't speak too much to the regular entrees. Concerning the happy hour - it's one of the best we've found in the burgh. They have a whole list of house wines (about six of them, I believe) that are $3 a glass...and they are pretty healthy pours! Additionally, all of the specialty cocktails are only $5. I appreciate this a lot as I enjoy getting cocktails but most happy hours only put one or two cocktails on special. I usually get the mojito; it's pretty good, and there aren't many other restaurants in the city that offer mojitos year-round.  On the food scene, all of the appetizers are half off which turns out to be a great deal when you come with a few friends. For example, the guacamole is usually $8, down to $4 at happy hour, and thus only a little over $1 per person if you come with two other friends. You can't beat that! My roommates and I LOVE dips, so we always go straight for the guacamole and the queso dip. The quesadillas with chicken are good as well. One of my friends is gluten-free, and she was easily accommodated by switching out the flour tortilla for a corn tortilla on the quesadillas.   Is this the best Mexican food I've ever had? Well, no, not by a long shot. But man, you can't beat the prices! If you're looking for delicious authentic Mexican food, the truth is that you probably want to look elsewhere. But the Steel Cactus is always a great choice if you're looking for a super cheap happy hour where you can share a few tasty drinks and apps!",

I like the spot for sure, it would be great for beers in the summer with the windows open. Cute and comfy and great for people watching.   The host was great, funny etc.... we had a laugh. He also turned the heaters on for us because in the winter it's a bit chilly up there.   Waitress was fine, didn't know the menu at all, and certainly had no idea what a vegan was....which is fine because she asked the kitchen .  I'm on prep so I had water because they had no hot tea. Jeff had a couple beers - on draft, nothing too much to offer but some Mexican beers.   I had a taco salad with added tofu less the guac and cheese and dressing - lol...in the taco bowl. It was fine but for my purposes these days I could've eaten 2.   It was taco Tuesday so Jeff had 4 hard shell tacos with \"vegan beef\". It is not vegan beef, it is beans and rice blended into putty with onions.   It was pretty greasy, not ultra healthy even if you try but we are the extreme so you can definitely find something to eat there. Not a vegan hot spot, but worthy in a pinch if you're starving, or if you eat cheese the nachos looked ok...how do you kill nachos though?   Oh! they did have vegan cheese...and I think it was the kind that melts so you could opt for that too.",

The first thing I appreciate about this place is how every design detail has been thought of. As a detail person I can so appreciate that. Lighting fixtures, tables, chairs, the stairs, the wall along the staircase, the open air windows in the warmer weather, the music... This place definitely has an ambience and I dig it.  We got here just before 5 on a Saturday night (tonight, actually), and it wasn't too crowded or too empty. Our waitress, Megan, was absolutely great. Knowledgeable about drinks and food, and on top of everything. We were never waiting around for her to come back which is such an awesome thing. We were still looking over the menu twice when she came back and most waiters get miffed and ignore you for a while when you get to talking with your party instead of reading over the menu (the nerve!), but this girl was back in just the right amount of time. I've never done it, but I'm sure waiting tables is a frustrating azz job, so I can appreciate someone who does it well.  Anywho, on to the food. I ordered the Taco Burrito and I'm not sure I've ever made a better decision. I love tacos. I love burritos. Combine the two and I'm pretty much really excited. The beef was seasoned deliciously, the rice was tasty, there was cheese and beans, sour cream and lettuce and diced tomatoes. I'm the kind of person who just keeps going 'Mmmmm' with delight when something tastes good and YO that was happening with this burrito. It was a little messy to eat since the sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes were on the side, but I'm sure it's so the lettuce doesn't get soggy and the sour cream doesn't melt all over. I'd still devour another one gladly, messy hands and all. The more I think about it the more I decide that I'll be returning for another burrito when the craving strikes. For some reason it's so hard to get a decent ground beef burrito and I'm so glad to have found this one. Am I sounding like a whack job? SHUP it was just a really good burrito, okay? The rest of my par-tay was very pleased with their meals as well (another burrito and tacos were ordered), and they were raving about their margs, which were on special for $5 for cinco de mayo weekend.  My only advice on this place (other than ORDER THE FRIGGIN TACO BURRITO)  is to avoid it at all costs after 8 PM. It seems to get boisterous from what I can tell walking by on an evening stroll. Unless you're looking to get belligerent on Yinzeritas. Then this place will be perfect for you.  Oh oh oh and also, I did want to comment on the staff's garb. I think it's a requirement to wear short shorts for the female waitresses, which I find pretty distasteful but, um, America, eff yeah, or something like that. Just wanted to note that as an interesting observation.",

    "text": "Been here 3 times. Been treated poorly every. Single. Time.  I understand that a lot people only review a restaurant when they have a bad experience, but in this case, they disappointed me every time and finally insulted me.  First visit: came here with my friends to drink. Rudely kicked out at 1:25am (?) by a mean bouncer who wouldn't let us finish our drinks, and were physically pushy as we left.  Second visit : came here for lunch. My food was slow to arrive, oversalted, and PRICEY (way more than other mexicans restaurants in the area).  The quality was much worse than Mad Mex's food. We were solicited with coupons for parties that the restaurant was hosting for their bar-crowd (most of their income), which was unwelcome.  Third visit, and most egregious: (this is epic, gotta read) We came for a big party. They gave us the upstairs floor, which was freezing, an blaring loud bar music at 7pm. One waitress was assigned the group of about 30+. We ordered, and waited, and waited. Some people in our group got their food at 7:55, our food came at 9pm, because the one waitress decided our food should come in \"waves\". Other people had finished eating and were leaving when my food came. We were so frustrated and hungry when our food, came, but when it did come, it was hurried, oversalted (again), and just low quality. Lots of undercooked rice and beans and veggies, little quality.   This is miserable enough, except for that it was all exacerbated by our very unprofessional waitress. The single waitress they assigned our party of 30 was overworked and couldn't cash us out in any organized way.  She was clearly stressed and overworked, and yet, the managers and other waitstaff never once stepped in to help despite her repeated pleas.  I  would have empathized with her, but the situation went further downhill when she claimed that someone lied about giving her a $100 bill, which she lost tand hen blamed on him.  We were literally standing up in our coats ready to leave after 2 and a half hours, and she still couldn't get everyone correct checks.  The most insane, incredible part of this mess: All of our checks had 20% (yes, more than the regular 18%) gratuity added. Slap in the face, absolutely insulting.  Never going here agin, not even to drink.",

It might be a better idea to just order beers here because if you're looking for some Mad Mex strength margaritas you aren't getting them here.",

    "text": "I would not recommend going to Steel Cactus, unless you're just having drinks on the rooftop.  I went to dinner with 10 of my friends on Saturday night and we all had an awful experience.  Ambiance - the decor is nice...very modern, clean, and urban though it is quite possibly the loudest restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh.  Granted it was a Saturday night, but we were forced to scream at one another just in our normal conversations.    Service - given our large party size, we should have had 2 servers, though we had one frazzled and sadly under-trained waitress.  Steel Cactus also doesn't seem to have busboys, which would improve this experience.  It took us about 20 minutes to get drinks - and I'm talking about water and Diet Cokes in addition to margaritas.  Also I ordered a bottle of wine that never came (in fact the server just disappeared and forgot about it altogether)...the only saving grace was that it didn't appear on my bill.   Food/Drinks - half our table liked their margaritas, while several others sent theirs back as they were terrible.  I got a vodka and soda and the soda was flat...and even their beers on tap were flat, so I think they just had issues that night.  I had a carne asada steak, which for $12.50 was a steal, but you could tell that it was old poor quality meat that was graying on the counter prior to it being cooked.  Overall, I wouldn't go back to Steel Cactus as there are better venues with mediocre/good Mexican food and better service and ambiance like Round Corner Cantina or Verde.",

Steel Cactus is particularly good during early and late night happy hours where you can get great drink specials, $2 tacos and $5 for GINORMOUS juicy burritos.

It had obvious fillers like black beans and rice but I wanted to give it a shot.  The meat tasted pretty good.  But it was overpowered by black beans and rice.  We also ordered a Chicken Quesadilla.  It didn't differ from my burrito all too much because all I tasted was black beans.  Worst part about this place are the tables.  The tables have holes all over them to mimic holes in wood.  Looks great except we find bits of old and new food in all the holes.  How disgusting is that?  My friends said the drinks were good but how bad can any place mess that up?  Overall, it's an ok spot to hang out and talk.  The hostess was nice and the waitress was good.  I had no problems with service.

A freak 70 degree day in March, and a restaurant with garage door Windows and a patio- they should've anticipated the crowd and scheduled a few more people. My friend and I waited awkwardly at the host stand for about five minutes (2 pm) before someone hurriedly grabbed us to sit us down, table was unbussed and dirty but the man took care of it right away. High top at the bar, right by the windows so the breeze was lovely and the view was ideal. He grabbed us our drinks and told us the server would be right there. The bar area was moderately crowded, with a few j crew dressed ex frat boy tables and some retail walnut street workers lunching, but nothing that would warrant the 20 minute wait we had before our adorable little server finally came over. We ordered some chips and salsa to start as well as our entrees. We could feel her pain, clearly she was struggling with what looked like an understaffing issue. As we idly chatted and stared at or empty iced teas, 20 minutes later our food came. The appetizer was forgotten about but whatever who needs the extra carbs (we weren't charged so no harm no foul). No complaints about the food, my pulled chicken tacos were delicious and my friends fiesta salad looked fresh to death. By the time we were done eating the little server came over and cashed us out promptly. We are easy going humans so obviously will give them the benefit of the doubt but in all actuality, the place was not crowded enough to excuse the slow, slow service. I'll be back tho, love me some avocado cream sauce.",

We got seated relatively easily for a weekend, however, so it wasn't a huge deal.   I am a big margarita fan, so I started off with a frozen mango. It was one of the only, if not THE only time in my life I have hated a margarita. It was sickly sweet and extremely artificial tasting. I ordered the chipotle beef tacos with pomegranate seeds for dinner, which were good, but unable to be enjoyed through the margartia-induced nausea.  I tried out Steel Cactus again last night hoping for redemption. I ordered a regular marg on the rocks and ended up giving away 2/3 of it. The bartender made it with orange juice (?!) and some other juice out of a bottle and it tasted nothing like any margarita I've ever tasted. Sickly sweet and frothy on top, just like the last one. Bleh. I'm usually very amenable to this kind of food and I adore tequila based drinks, but I'm going to stick to beer here,",

    "text": "Steel Cactus is not a Mexican restaurant because it doesn't serve real food. Their food tastes like plastic. Even their chips are gross-- how do you mess up tortilla chips?! I do like the open-air space and cute decor, and have been for drinks a few times. The drinks have always been made well and are tasty, but are seriously overpriced compared to other bars in the area. Every time I have come, I have had to deal with staff with attitudes. Most recently, I had not one, but TWO unpleasant incidents. On a Saturday night around 9:00 PM as things started to get busy, I was ordering from a female bartender who was moving around while listening and ended up next to her coworker, causing me to talk across him (he was taking orders from other customers). The male bartender (shorter guy with piercings, I believe) very rudely snapped at me and was like SHUT UP AND WAIT YOUR TURN, I'M HELPING SOMEONE ELSE. I was appalled that he would talk to a customer like this to begin with, much less one that wasn't even talking to him. I informed him that I was talking to his coworker and that was that. About an hour later, things started to get too wild for my group, so we went to close out our tabs. When I got my bill, I almost toppled out of my bar stool. There were charges for things I did not order and the drinks that I ordered that were on special did not have the discount applied. The girl said her manager decided to cut off the special, but since I had been there for hours and was not aware, they would honor it. I was willing to wait for the manager to come take care of the extra items and drink prices, but luckily the bartender was able to take care of it on her own. So she said/so I thought. Thank goodness I saved my receipt, because when I checked my credit card charges two days later, there was a separate charge for the amount that she \"took off\" my bill. Rather than remove the items from the check, in an effort to get me to leave and free up the bar stool quicker, she split them off onto a separate check and ran my card twice, only giving me the one receipt for the correct amount. I did call and speak with the manager, who was very understanding and refunded me the unauthorized charges immediately. I am glad the situation was remedied, but I am shocked by the dishonesty and disrespect exhibited by the bar staff at Steel Cactus. Steel Cactus isn't overall awful, but it will never be my pick when it is my turn to pick where to eat/drink.",

    "text": "I'll keep this short and sweet.    The food is standard PennaMex.  Think Mad Mex, but not as good.  The chips have been stale two out of three times.  The chicken tacos were bland--cumin, cayenne, black pepper, cilantro...any or all would have been welcome.  The guac just made me sad--and tears of guac depression could have only improved things.  The draft beers are small and the \"yinzerita\" makes me want to punch someone.  The regular marg is all shades of awful--the mix is just bad and there's either too much or not enough salt.  The music selection can be fun.  The bros are always in high numbers here if you're looking for chest bumps and high fives.  Why did I give it three stars?  It's totally fine on a summer night with a few friends on the top floor either before 11pm or not on a weekend.  Or it's okay for sitting at the bar on the second floor and enjoying a whiskey--the top shelf liquor selection there is decent .  I've only had terrible and very slow service at top bar and at the tables on all floors, but I've found the security staff and second floor bartenders to be super nice.  It's a bro bar on the new Walnut Street, so take it as what it is.",

    "text": "Great addition to Walnut Street.  I highly recommend attending for happy hour as I think they have one of the best happy hour deals in Pittsburgh.  From 5-7 it is half off all appetizers which includes guacamole, chips/salsa and quesadillas.  The specialty drinks at $5 and they usually have $2.50 beer specials and $3 wine specials.  This past visit I went with the specialty margarita (also the Yinzerita is only $7 at happy hour) and my date choose the Moscow Mule.  We ordered chips and guacamole (the guacamole is delicious!) and I got a beef taco and he ordered the pork quesadilla. All super delicious and it only came to $21!  On Tuesdays it is Taco Tuesdays so you could order as many $2.50 tacos as you would like and can pick from flour or corn soft shells (they do not have hard shells) and pick your meat as well as the toppings.  Great place in the summer with the rooftop bar! When it is busy sometimes the service is not that great but I can live with that. Also recommend trying a pitcher of margaritas (great deal).",

After a late lunch at 3 pm we wanted something simple so Steel Cactus it is a place I am aware of from living in Pittsburgh but never visited. Let me make it known I could tell this was not some super authentic Mexican restaurant so I didn't review it on that level which I'l leave the private owner that spends 24/7 in his kitchen doing the best he can to make the best in town Mexican dishes. So rating scale let's do Tex-Mex vs the Competition !   Starting out we got some chips and salsa which if I recall mild and hot but the hot didn't seem really hot but it's just chip's and salsa were not going to make that much of an impact here but note it anyway. A margarita my gf got which was tasty and a cheap Miller Light on top for myself.    Main meals I got a 3 of the special tacos. I can't actually recall the name of the taco as it is not updated online on there main menu at either locations. Bistec (steak) taco with corn salsa, queso fresco and pickled onions.. Really tasty and hit the spot.  All around the place is neat, the service was good and the prices are decent. I will return to try some specials and tacos. 3 stars on the rating scale here but in reality let's do 3.5!",

All of the food came lukewarm. Not to include, everything tasted the same. There was no distinct flavor. The meal was blase and left me feeling disgusting. I only give it one star because the food came out quickly, but everything else was not good. Do not go to Steel Cactus- there are wayyyyy better Mexican restaurants to eat at!",

    "text": "The worst meal we've had in a long time.  20 minutes to get our drinks after we sat down, another 15 for the chips and salsa, and I wish our main courses never showed up.  We had two waitresses (waitress in training), how hard would it be for one of them to run over with our drinks and chips?  And the place was empty!  Anyway let's just say the service was lousy except for another waitress (extra fit young lady) who was very pleasant and helpful. Now to the food- first we ordered the chips and salsa and of course they charged us $4 each for two salsas without notifying us.  Ok so be it, but the problem was that the salsas were fermenting like they have been in the back of the frig for months!  Anyway, I needed to eat something after 45 minutes so I ate them but everybody else was grossed out. Next, I had the burrito and luckily it was fairly edible but rest of the table ordered salads and they looked horrible.  My wife had the chicken fajita salad but came out was lettuce and uncooked red peppers, that's it!  No chicken , no guacamole, no nothing.  The others were Cobb salads and the chicken looked totally burned like a charcoal brickette.  They didn't want to complain and said it was nonetheless tasty but I'm sure they went home and are probably still talking about it. Finally the place just didn't appear or smell clean.  It had that sticky feel and smell almost like a Sunday morning in the fraternity house. It's a shame because it's an A1 location with a great outside seating area and nice decor inside. Need less to say we will not be back.  Patrons and mad mex are much better options.",

I walked in to be greeted by an extremely friendly host who sat me close to a giant window with a gorgeous view where I enjoyed an over the top but delectable margarita with a corona known as a \"Yinzerita\". My co worker got a blood orange Margarita which was one of the better I've had. You can tell this place uses real ingredients rather than High fructose corn syrup off the shelf mix. It had a real kick and a wonderful fruit flavor too often lot in a modern margarita. I wish they had these where I'm from.  was served by a young woman who was incredibly cheery and quickly answered my few questions about their admittedly complex menu. I ended up ordering a set of fabulous fish tacos and guacamole, my co workers ordered enchiladas which I stole a bite of and were somehow even better than my meal. Overall i have to say my time at steel cactus was my favorite of the restaurants I visited in Pittsburgh, It was cheery had a great atmosphere and great food, and the service was excellent. My server was lovely and helped me and my coworkers find other exciting sights and attractions in Pittsburgh while we were there, while also providing us excellent service even while the restaurant was packed.  We all left with full bellies and smiles on our faces my only regret is that they don't have one of these back in my home town or I would visit it all the time.",

Service: 1/6 I've been here countless times, and have had bad service almost eveytime. From taking very long to get a drink, or even any attention, to food taking very long, to the attitude of many of the servers, it's pretty poor across the board.  Affordability: 4/6. Not overly pricey. About average for what it is Atmosphere: 6/6 very nice bar. Comfy. And the rooftop bar is very nice as well. It feels like I place I want to be.

I can honestly say this was the best guacamole I have ever had. I had three beef tacos served gringo style as my entree. It was slightly hotter than I expected but delicious.  Out dessert was the fried oreos. All I can say about that is ...yummy. I highly recommend Steel Cactus for the drinks (Yinzer margarita was delicious although could use a tad more alcohol), the food,  and the service (our server Courtney was awesome). We were also",

It's decent enough for a happy hour when you're getting drinks and chips and dip, or even just to get drinks, but I wouldn't recommend the place if you're looking for a great Mexican dining experience, or great dining experience in general.",

One had a lot of sauce inside and no pico, the other barely any sauce and lots of pico. Chips and salsa were good. Service was horrible. The two hostesses are more interested in talking with each other than seating guests. They kept looking at us, but kept talking. We finally asked to seat ourselves, then they seated us. Our waiter was HORRIBLE! He was rude. He kept asking us if we wanted seperate a checks. We were seated at a four top, but sat beside each other. We were both wearing our wedding rings and my 5carat diamond...we are obviously married. My husband said no, but the waiter wouldn't let it go. He kept it up. Then before we left he snidely said \"sorry to make this uncomfortable\". Save yourself the trouble...drive another mile and go to Mad Mex...always great food!",

I asked for a Yuengling draft...she said they were out and walked away. Then I had to get her attention again and ordered a Blue Moon draft and she said we don't have it in draft, its not even up there (pointing to the drafts). It was clearly labeled with the other draft beers. Again she walked away. My friend then ordered a Margarita and she glanced down and said they don't have any glasses for it AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN without asking what else she could get us. When I asked her if she was making the drink she practically yelled saying \"I TOLD YOU WE HAD NO GLASSES\". Another bartender came over to us and I ordered a Blue Moon draft and he got it for me with no problem while I watched other people drinking Margaritas. I was so disappointed in the service and disrespect we received. I liked the bar but will never recommend it because of that one bartender",

The person with me ordered the carnitas nachos and a house margarita.  I had a order of the picante guacamole, the Mexican street corn and two build your own tacos.  (It was Tuesday and Happy Hour).  The nachos were OK.  The quest they used was kinda thin and watery, so chips were a soggy mess within 20 min.  My tacos were good - grilled chicken with some fixings.  The Guacamole was also good - smooth with pieces of jalapeno on top.   I would order everything again EXCEPT for the Mexican street corn which was clearly frozen corn on the cob from Costco.... the flavors with the dressings on the corn were fine. It the corn itself was clearly boiled and soft and not fresh AT ALL.  It was actually kind of gross.    Overall, I would go again, but definitely avoid the Mexican street corn at all costs unless they decide to start using fresh corn.  OR they make it a seasonal appetizer for when corn is in season.",

We were allowed through the bottom door after showing our ID's. Then we get up to the upper portion of the bar where we were harassed by a bouncer for our ID's again. Granted we thought this was a little outrageous but we complied again. The bouncer refused to believe we were 21 even though we are all 22 and 23. He asked to see our facebook (of all things) to match with our ID. Then he asked to see our credit cards. I have never had that happen before in any place. Three forms for people who are 22 and 23. We were getting a little agitated as you might imagine. Especially since we were cold sober at this point, which makes it even worse. The bouncer who obviously had an agenda decided to kick us out anyway. He physically assaulted two of us.   Unfortunately for steel cactus this happened to me, and probably fortunate for all the other people this might have happened to. I work for the Pennsylvania AG's office, and you better believe there will be an investigation into this, and whether this is a pattern. Due to the sensitive nature of those investigations, I won't specify the exact reason I filed the report. Two of us have also filed police reports against the bouncer as well for harassment and assault.  All the owner has to do is look at the camera's and he/she we will see his/her worker was in the wrong. I hope they take this seriously as you better believe I am.  If anything like this has happened to you at Steel Cactus, please contact me: <a href=\"mailto:marksmith191576@gmail.com\">marksmith191576@gmail.com</a>  Please explain describe what happened, and when it happened. I will gladly add you to the report already filed.",

The chips literally tasted like cardboard. The guacamole was very very cold and didn't have much flavor, didn't taste or see any cilantro or garlic. Just a little bit of diced tomatoes and onions, so nothing special there.   Then the food came. I had the grilled tofu tacos with avocado and spicy cabbage on top. Honestly, my favorite tofu tacos ever. The flour tortillas were tasty and the rice and beans were good. The waitress was very nice and the food was exactly as we ordered it.  The drinks were reasonably priced, $4.50 for a corona.   The atmosphere was average sound-wise at 6:30 on a Saturday and there was a family with a baby there as well as what looked like several large groups of friends there when we went. So it would be suitable for anyone. I would go back.",

The atmosphere is also really nice, especially if you get to sit on the roof top during the warmer months.   I've visited several times for drinks only, and loved it. Went for food and it wasn't too great. Had the chips and guac (half off for happy hour!) which was really good, creamy and garlicky the way good guac should be. My two friends had the enchiladas and they both enjoyed them, but I did notice they were pretty small. My shrimp and Carnitas burrito didn't taste like Carnitas, but some other sort of mystery meat in some weird sauce. The shrimp were excellent, and if I ever give this place an order chance I will stick to only shrimp. And the sauce on top tasted like spaghetti sauce. Don't know what was up with that, but I was not a fan.   Like I said, service is great and so are drinks, so I'll probably be back in the warmer months, but I wouldn't call this a destination spot for food.   Oh, and if you're short and have short legs, do not attempt to sit at the high tables with the high chairs. Trust me on this one.",

Chicken and potato wedges were great, as well as the grilled onions. The huge chunks of romaine were undesirable, and the ranch was probably the worst ranch I've ever had. The chipotle ranch was a bit better, but not impressed. I would classify the food as average, and I would eat here again during the happy hour specials that they have, because it's not worth paying full price. The apps were the best part, check out my pictures of the Mexican sweet corn and chorizo dip... Though the chip to dip ratio is wayyyy off. We thought the frozen margaritas could be a bit more \"frozen\", but they were pretty tasty anyway. Tips:  1) There are few places in Pittsburgh that have nailed  authentic Mexican cuisine, but the ones trying for spin-off food aren't quite there either... And this is one of them.  2)Go to Mad-Mex for flavor, quality, and delicious wannabe Mexican food. After 11 it's half off in Oakland.  3) If Taco Bell sold margaritas, it would put Steel Cactus out of business.  4) Try El Burro Comedor in north side if you want the real stuff.  5) Read Yelp reviews on everything! I don't take my own advice, but I'll learn eventually!",

    "text": "\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is actually a pretty good description; thanks Yelp. I have just never been impressed by Steel Cactus, and more often than not, let down. I really try not to go here, however, this place is popular amongst a group of people I spend some time with that work close by... so most of the time its me trying to persuade them into going somewhere else.   Being that it is in Shadyside, and on Walnut specifically, I'd expect it to be one of the best not only in taste, but also service. I honestly have to say Mad Mex is way better. I would expect this place to be better even if it weren't on Walnut.   My first time there I had the blackened mahi mahi with edamame succotash, cilantro rice, and a grilled lime... sounded fantastic on paper, but in reality it was quite bland and forgettable. I thought the lime would have at least enough juice left to squeeze on the fish, but it was just a piece of dry green pulp, so its inclusion was quite pointless. Sad to say, it was probably the most boring meal I've ever had. Same with the house chips, salsa, and guac, they are just lacking flavor and don't keep me wanting to eat them (and trust... I love me some chips & guac). On another occasion, I had their tacos - carne sarteneada. Containing: carne, guajillo pepper salsa, red onion confit, chipotle ranch, bleu cheese, & scallions. While a step up from the mahi mahi, it was nothing to write home about.  To their benefit, they do have a great space. I like the layout, everything looks nice. They have a great outdoor patio area, and I like their sangria. Their mixed drinks and margs I've found to be prettttty weak on the pour.  In all, I think Steel Cactus is out of place in this area, it belongs in the Southside or maybe some suburb where multiple good options are less prevalent.",

The space is really cool, and the menu is very promising, but the execution just doesn't quite work out and we ended up disappointed.  We ordered: --chips and gringo salsa:  shouldn't chips and salsa be free?  That gripe aside, these were quite good.  The salsa had a nice favor and good kick from the jalapenos, and the chips tasted fresh. --fish tacos:  \"Grilled Mahi, red onion confit, pineapple, avocado, cilantro, & cayenne lime creme\" sounds amazing, and it almost was, except they burnt the fish.  I'll give them points for the idea, but it didn't quite work out. --chipotle brisket tacos:  another dish that sounded fantastic but then just wasn't.  I tried a bite of my husband's lunch-- the barbecue sauce was fantastic and the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch, but the meat itself tasted oddly like bacon and not at all like slow-cooked brisket. --rice and beans: came with both tacos.  Nothing extraordinary, but no complaints. --Pacifico: I'll give props to anywhere that carries my favorite Mexican beer, but lime and a glass would've been nice.  Also-- do they have breakfast, or brunch on Saturdays?  There was a bloody mary bar, but we didn't get a brunch menu.  Then I heard someone at the table next to us ordering a breakfast burrito, and was kind of disappointed because that probably would have been my order.  On the bright side, the prices are reasonable, the service is good and I'm a fan of the neighborhood.  I haven't been thrilled with Pennsylvania Mexican food yet, and unfortunately Steel Cactus was not the exception.  I'll have to keep looking.",

The rice accompanying the burrito had a strange flavor.  I have to give it to them, the chips and salsa were better.  Then, to make our experience more weird they opened the window; in the middle of the winter. I guess the guys in the kitchen were hot. Haven't they heard of a fan?  It's a trendy place. The layout reminded me of the old Cozumel. I miss that place. Now that was a mexican restaurant!   Service was ok, but I guess it's because they only had three tables to wait.  I give them 2 stars for the chips and salsa. Way to go!",

    "text": "The rooftop deck is a nice touch in the friendlier seasons, but the food could be better. They have a decent happy hour with cheap mixed drinks, house wines, etc.. The chipotle salsa we ordered was good and definitely repeatable. The chips were thick and strong--perfect for dipping into guacamole, which was unfortunately subpar. The avocados must not have been ripe enough and were stringy.  My fish tacos came on double corn tortillas which I approve of, with a side of rice and beans. The tacos themselves were only \"meh\" however, same for the rice. The beans were pretty good.  Overall, my feelings are mixed about Steel Cactus. It has potential, but currently is just a good place to get a drink, salsa, and enjoy the nice weather. The food quality could use improvement.",

They force you into a mediocre brunch menu....unless you want to wait. Too hungry, we ordered brunch. I had the eggs and chorizo burrito .  It was cold. When I asked the waiter to heat it up, he said he would have another one made. They head waiter came out and told me the likely reason was that they put avocado Guacamole on it and that made the rest of it cold. When they brought out the new one, it had the guacamole on the side. It sounds like a lot of people have sent it back. Even the Redone one was not that good. It was dried out chorizo and eggs were like warm. The other people in my party got other items that were just as mediocre. The only redeeming quality of this place is the chips and salsa. The bathrooms smell like a fraternity house bar, and are about just as clean. If you want decent Mexican food, I suggest going to southside.",

I went about two months ago with a large party that eventually dwindled down to four people. Our waitress was incredibly slow at taking our order and bringing us drinks. Then, when we were ready for our checks, she brought them out incorrectly at least three times. Each time we would tell her what the correct order was, and it would still either be incorrect or incorrectly priced. Now, we all got sick of waiting so we just wrote on the back of a receipt what each order had and how much it would cost. Then she took a long time bringing our checks back, but at least they were correct this time. We ended up spending 40 minutes waiting to pay, because of how slow she was and how many times the checks were incorrect.   I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend anyone else going either.",

There is a Bloody Mary listed on the menu with two options, regular or loaded up. He could not tell me what was included in the regular or what the options were for the loaded up version. We asked other simple questions regarding menu items that he also could not answer. Nor did he ever offer to get the answers. In addition to his lack of knowledge, the food was less than satisfying. The chicken for the tacos was flavorless, as was the guacamole, rice and beans. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were hard boiled instead of poached. My entire family loves Mexican food and were excited to give steel cactus a try. Never again! They should be ashamed of the subpar product that they are associating with their brand.",

After 20 minutes we were finally able to put in an order of chips and salsa and it literally took 30 minutes to come out to our table. No one ever came to see if we needed drink refills or silverware, plates, napkins, nothing. We literally never got any of that. There was no manager in sight to speak with either.  The worst part was, it wasn't busy. It was during a Penguins playoff game. Half their tvs werent functional. They absolutely should have been expecting a crowd and they were horribly incapable of providing any service to us or any of the tables around us. When we arrived, there were tables covered in dirty dishes that were still untouched when we left an hour later. When we were finally able to flag any employee down to get our server over to us so that we could pay and leave; it genuinely took them 15 minutes to run our card. How is that even possible? At this point in expecting to find fraudulent charges on my account soon given how long they held my card for.  I can't express my dissatisfaction enough. I will never visit the restaurant again. I will likely never visit a steel cactus again either. If I could I would give zero stars. Stay away. Please don't give this place your business. I hope a sink hole swallows exclusively this business,  because I rather enjoy the neighborhood.",

My friend ordered the \"vegan beef\" tacos, which are apparently just tacos with rice and beans. \"Vegan beef.\" The rest of our meals were honestly sub-par.  The only reason I am giving this place 1 star is that they discounted 10% off our meal and put the apps on the house after we complained to the manager. Our server was unattentive and there was no excuse considering the restaurant was not even full.

They have all these taco options and it's so painful to just pick one flavor, so I like to get their three taco combo so I don't miss out on anything! You can pick the kind of sauce that goes on top, which I love! The tacos come with one pork, one steak, and one chicken. I of course had to get the avocado creme on all three because YUM! Not so much, as instead of sauce, they just put avocado on it. With NO sauce! And overcooked, dry meat. So you can imagine how dry it was overall. I had to take a sip of water with every bite of all three tacos just to choke it down. It was cold on top of that. Unfortunately, everyone at the table had similar experiences and we were all a bit bummed. Only saving grace are their margaritas. Worth it for the drinks, but I wouldn't order food if you go!",

Either way we decided to go to the rooftop bar to have a drink. Ordered a pitcher of margaritas and chips and salsa. The pitcher was given to us in a carafe so it didn't even seem like it was the full pitcher compared to other people's orders. The chips and salsa (even though that was separate from the kitchen back up) still seemed to take forever to come up. Then overheard someone ordering a beer and apparently the kegs were not working. Just very confused as to what happened to this good restaurant that has declined so much in quality and service. I rarely give less than three stars but this one definitely deserved it for the recent visit. Hopefully this was just a fluke and maybe they're in the process of revamping management.",

Food took longer than expected, with 1 person receiving a completely different entree than ordered. The manager then tried to charge us for the wrong entree as well as the additional food. The tacos were all cold and did not come as ordered. When we spoke to manager she said she never told us that. Then took half an hour to get our correct bill. This was my second terrible experience in a month here - I will not be giving them my business again.",

I've been going since they opened and I'm sad to see how the quality of this business is decreasing , service is awful, the servers are killing this restaurant, the only good experiences I've had has been at the bar, I've waited over 10 minutes to get our server just greet us, i've gotten a mimosa spilled, moved from a table after getting our drink order because the host forgot they were closing it for a private, waited over 40 minutes for an order of tacos, the bartender serving us because the server didn't show up, and food is not too bad, management needs to get it together and improve, there's always something going on with the front of the house, it's beyond ridiculous!",

It was very crowded probably due to it being a Saturday night, but my group and I were able to find a corner to have all to ourselves and had a blast! I ordered some different fun and fruity drinks and they were good and priced low-moderate. The first floor is really dark and flooded with people at the bar and eating. The second floor has some tables, some booths on the side and standing room by the bar and at the corners of the building. I would definitely come back here on a drinking night, or even to try their food in the afternoon some time! Definitely check this place out for the atmosphere, drinks and location!",

I did order soup yesterday and it took almost 5 minutes to get a spoon for it because apparently the waiter didn't actually have access to the soup spoons and had to get one from the kitchen.  It's ok though because it wasn't particularly good (cold or warm) anyway.  Another thing I would like to see is some consistency.  The PIC and I order pretty much the same things when we go there, but each time the dishes are different.  Do the nachos come with black beans or was that a mistake this time?  How do I get a little cup of chopped up jalepenos once and the next time I get whole ones?  Why do I get a different salsa each time?  It's all very confusing.  There is one thing that will make me give this place an extra star - get some darned refried beans on that menu!",

I almost don't want to mention it here so it doesn't get crowded, but they pour a hefty glass of wine for just $3. Other drinks are also reasonably priced and the appetizers are 1/2 off.  It's great. -Service.  I've sat at both the bar and dining area, and the service was great at both locations.  It did take a while for drinks to come out, but our food was served right away. -Tacos.  They double-wrap their tacos, and I think the use a corn tortilla instead of a flour one.  Delicious.  Steel Cactus can improve on a few things: -Menu.  It's not a huge menu, which I usually prefer, but I wish there were more vegetarian options.  The tacos were good though.  The guacamole was just okay.  They had a great choice of salsas, and the one we had (there was corn in it! was great). -Drinks.  I had a regular margarita on the rocks and it wasn't the best.  My friends' specialty cocktails were also on the sweet side.  I'm not giving up on Steel Cactus just yet.  Their happy hour is great and I still have to try their other 4 salsas!",

Instead of being the mahi taco that we ordered, it was a taco full of shrimp. If I had taken a bite of this taco I could have had an anaphylactic reaction. Thankfully, I saw that it looked different and immediately put it back in the box. I am very disappointed that they not only got my order wrong, but also put my life in danger.",

Which was fine.  She was trying to sort it out.  Two bouncers then came toward us, one a bald, black gentleman, and one a blonde tall white gentleman.  They yelled at us to \"Get OUT, Bar is Closed!\"  I told them, I am waiting for a corrected check.  The server messed up my check.  The blonde guy yelled back, directly at me, while I am in front of my friends, \"I DON\"T CARE, GET OUT!\"  He did not stop staring at me for the next minute or two.  I asked him if he didn't want me to pay my check.  Again, he yelled \"I DON'T CARE.  GET OUT!\"  This was intensely unprofessional.  And i will NOT return to this establishment.  There are plenty of other places in Shadyside where I can spend my money.    I was with friends.  And I was embarrassed.

Got pitchers of regular margaritas and they were absolutely disgusting. Too tart. Between that and the hot box that the glass roof creates, people were getting overheated and sick.

    "text": "Oh man, I wanted to like this place so hard for multiple reasons: Mexican food is one of my top three favorite types of cuisine, they have rooftop seating (score!), it's affordable eats in Shadyside - ohmuhgawd!  We visited during the Shadyside Arts Festival, which was a bad move on our part. Everything in Shadyside was crazy packed. However, we weren't in a rush to get anywhere so that didn't bother us too much. We put our names on a the list for a table and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, they seated us at a table that had a speaker situated about 2 feet above it. As loud as they were playing their music, this was not cool. I saw a couple leaving the bar so we snagged their seats instead.  The bar area is neat and reminds me of one of my favorite bars back in Florida (Monkey Bar in Orlando!). The open air design is very nice. The bar was packed, which was not surprising as it definitely has the best seats in the house, besides the rooftop.  I've read and heard of others complaining about the service and it was no different when we visited. My boyfriend had actually come earlier in the week and said there was barely anyone there and the service still was incredibly slow. So there's that.  I decided to start off with a mojito, one of my favorite drinks. This place goes down as making probably the second worst mojito I've ever had. There was so much club soda! It's just supposed to be a splash! *sigh*  We put in orders for carne asada tacos, Pescado tacos, and the roja salsa and chips. The salsa was just straight up awful. I don't know what they do to it, but I have never had salsa that bad. I asked one of the bartenders to take it off for us because neither one of us would be eating it.  I was delighted to see that they make most of their food authentically: cilantro, queso fresca, salsa, etc. Sadly, the steak in my tacos was way overdone. It was crunchy. They should also greatly consider double wrapping their shells. While tasty, those things do not hold up at all. It's no fun eating a taco with a fork. My boyfriend said his mahi mahi tacos were super delish and they looked it. Whatever they do to the black beans is to die for and the spanish rice was really good. However, I don't think they'll be knocking off Round Corner Cantina for good, authentic Mexican food for me (and it's cheaper!).   Pros: great bar area, would be fantastic for hanging out and having drinks  Cons: slow service, so-so food",

A couple that was seated a few minutes after us was finished with their main course 15 minutes before we even go ours.  And when we did it was very disappointing.  The \"guacamole\" was just mashed avocados, no seasoning whatsoever.  The rice was clearly a mix like Zatarans or something and the beans were equally unseasoned and appeared to have been poured out of a can and undrained.  Really gross.  The shrimp in the tacos were well cooked, but it was all downhill from there, no flavor, overcooked veggies and to top off- two really thick and cold corn tortillas for each taco.  Having no flavor is the worst crime against Mexican food. Being slow and rude, the worst crime against service.  Really terrible place.",

I came in and posted up with a few friends at a table right by the bar and closest to the open windows allowing one to see Walnut street. On my particular visit, the iPhone 5 was being released, so it was fun looking at all the Apple peeps waiting in line to get their hands on the newest parcel of apple products.   I went with the Yinzer Margarita that comes with an upside down bottle of Corona in a giant margarita glass. It was mois bien.   For the fare, I went with the Mahi Tacos, or some kind of fish tacos, and they were spot on. Just as good if not better than Mad-Mex that's for certain.  I'll be back Steel Cactus. You can count on that...",

First and foremost, the location/environment/ambience/decor of this place is fantastic.  The split level structure, open to the outside as well as the roof top deck are all amazing.    Now for the negatives...The bar service though was somewhat mediocre.  Yes, it was kind of busy, but it seemed like they were staffed with plenty of employees and should have been able to do a more efficient job of handling the flow of patrons.  The food was somewhat bland.  No complementary chips were provided.  Not a huge fan of their traditional guac as it really lacked the taste of True avocados, and could probably benefit from more garlic and salt.  The veggie burrito was quite bland and lacking enough beans and veggies.  It really tasted like fast food.  I suppose the food was reasonably priced, but I've had better for the amount I paid.  Unless you're in the area and are dying for a margarita or something, I would just come here for drinks and just skip the meal.  There is better Mexican food to be had in this town.",

Their margaritas are unbelievably sugary and have almost no alcohol in them. The interior has a musty smell that is really makes me lose my appetite every time I walk in. I really don't get this place, a little seasoning on the tacos, and a new salsa and guac recipe could go a long way",

We were able to sit at the bar despite it being relatively busy and were able to snag two margaritas for $6 a piece. Not a terrible price and they were really delicious! I recommend trying their seasonal blood orange and cranberry ginger margs. Worth it.  Thankfully we were in no rush to eat as it took about an hour of waiting for us to be seated for a meal. They had the upstairs closed (not sure why, possibly because Cinco de Mayo was the next day and they had decor up there?) so it took significantly longer to seat people. What agitated us was that there were several small, 4 person tables COMPLETELY EMPTY that they would not seat anyone at. Just our luck, as soon as we waited a full hour to eat and were seated in the back area, they began to seat people in the front that had been empty for an hour. Go figure.   Our waiter was great, he announced that he was new to serving and that he would do his best to make sure we got everything we needed. He was incredibly friendly and he did an outstanding job at taking care of us. Food in general is pretty standard, nothing terribly unique, but if you are simply looking for general Mexican fare, this is a good option.",

The food itself was very bland, not a bunch of seasoning and no spice.   Came for drinks on the rooftop bar, it was a Friday night and there was only one bartender. I felt bad because it was pretty crowded but that also meant that drinks took awhile to come out.   Came here for appetizers and drinks as well. This is the main reason I'm giving the place two stars. The bar wasn't open so we were sitting at a dining table. Service was slow, we didn't even get napkins or silverware on the table. Drinks were not refilled often and it was hard to get our server's attention. The nachos ($9.50 for the chicken nachos!!!) were structured super weird. toppings were divided into portions?? So it was hard to get a full scoop of all the toppings on your nachos. Also, the cheese was under all the toppings so the cheese soaked through and made a large soggy tortilla on the bottom. There wasn't a lot of chicken and the chips were pretty soggy. Super super disappointing. Also the downstairs eating area literally smelled like diapers???",

Air-conditioning was broken, restaurant was extremely hot (that you could have passed out), kept all the doors closed and they offered no compensation for our inconvenience.  Ordered food and everything lacked taste & flavor.  What gives with the kitchen?  I think they need to close for a few weeks and regroup to really determine how they should run a Mexican restaurant.  I won't be returning any time soon,",

The bartender (young man working the rooftop) appeared rather inconvenienced when we simply asked for two drinks while waiting to be seated. We asked him to see a menu and you would have thought we asked him for a million dollars. Next, the food was sadly disgusting. Our waitress was friendly; however, the chips were soggy and the chicken had thick chunks of chewy pieces. Nobody was able to finish their food. Overall, worst Mexican food I have ever had.",

When we came here last during happy hour in September it seemed like one waitress was staffing the entire seated area on the upper deck. She was trying her best but service was not great - we ordered a quesadilla and reminded them about it 2-3 times but never got it. I wish the restaurant would make sure to support their waitstaff.  Happy hour and daily specials are a fantastic deal! There are food and drink specials. The drinks are yummy and strong. The food portions were large and well priced, everything was yummy. The bartenders upstairs are quick.  The upper deck area is really nice and definitely the place to be, if fills up during busy times. Just note you have to walk up 1-2 flights of stairs and I am not sure if there is an elevator for handicapped accessibility.",

    "text": "This is one of those places I can give or take. In my opinion it is kind of like a knock off Mad Mex. While I am all for trying some knock offs, I would prefer to stick with the real deal here.  First off, we were seated up stairs (it was February, 40 degrees out, and very windy). Of course they have the whole area covered in plastic, which is terrible when it's windy out. Sounded like we were on a rocket ship about to blast off. It would have been a plus that we had a heater right beside our table, if the heater actually put off any kind of heat.   The fresh chips are pretty good. We decided just to go for the Roja salsa, which contains roma tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos. It had a good taste to it and had just the right amount kick to it that I like.   I for whatever reason decided to get the Shredded Chicken Enchiladas. It comes with 3 rolled enchiladas topped, and I chose to have it covered in verde sauce. There is also some kind of cheese covering them. Honestly, if it wasn't for the sauce, the enchiladas would have been completely bland.Not much I can say for the rice. It was bland as well. The beans tasted like beans, nothing special.  All in all, I might come back just to see how the tacos taste. But It really isn't somewhere that I would recommend to anyone.",

The margs are pretty decent, although I vow to never try the yinzeritas... There's just something about beer and maragaritas that doesn't mix for me.  The quesadillas are great here, always crispy. The salsa options are delicious as well. I had a mango salsa in the summertime, and it was delicious.   The service here can be a bit spotty, so I usually don't come here during the cold months when I can't sit in the rooftop bar area. But if you're looking for a good view in a good location, this is definitely a fun spot to try in the warmer months.",

Service was very good and we had no problem splitting checks in a large group.  I love the space Steel Cactus has, the rooftop seating area is roomy and heated when needed.    I ordered the Camarones Tacos (grilled shrimp, sweet chili sauce).  The tacos were very yummy, but I am admittedly a sucker for faux mexican.  If you like Mad Mex, which this place will inevitably get compared to, you should be able to find something you like at Steel Cactus.  I wasn't too excited about the rice and bean sides, but I ate them all, so that says something (I can eat an unlimited amount of any quality of rice, though, to be honest).  During my happy hour I did hear people's disappointment with the Yinzerita, as others have reviewed here.  My advice:  avoid it, go for happy hour, enjoy a Dogfish Head or two (or more), and don't expect to be transported to Mexico CIty.  It is what it is, folks.",

    "text": "The Steel Cactus is def. A-OK in my book.  The biggest selling point is the deck - I would go as far to say this is one of the best decks in the 'burgh.  It's HUGE, with ample seating, AND offers a glass-covered ceiling so you can enjoy the outdoors without worrying about the elements.  In our fair city, that's key since it does rain here every once in awhile ;)  Daily drink specials are offered, as well as Happy Hour and Late-Night deals.  This makes Steel Cactus ideal for a slightly-younger crowd than myself.  No hate there, just an observation.  The peeps enjoying the deck last night were most certainly in the mid-20s age bracket.  I enjoyed the Carna Asada Enchiladas, per @Kristian M.'s suggestion.  I'm usually hesitant to order steak in any of my Mexican food, at the risk of it not being a good cut and then ruining the whole entree.  Not the case at the Steel Cactus; the steak was tender, juicy, and had a great flavor.  SC is a fun place to enjoy tasty adult beverages on special and above-average Mexican treats in a youthful, energetic atmosphere on one of Pittsburgh's Premier Porches.",

She was extremely apologetic and her constant communication with me showed that they really value their customers, going well above the call of duty.  On our visit this past Friday, I was able to sample an item I had heard so much about from a friend--the molcajete bowl--and it turned out to be as amazing as promised. The meat and seafood in the bowl were well prepared and the flavors of the sauce complemented them nicely. My wife had the tacos which she found very much to her liking and we both also enjoyed the dip trio and the deep fried oreos for dessert.  Had you asked me about this place immediately following our first visit, I most likely would have not been very kind.  But that's why I didn't review it right away. I believe in giving every establishment a second opportunity and that additional chance proved to change my opinion 180 degrees.  Our server, Courtney, was very energetic and attentive and the chef even stopped by at our table to inquire about our food. Everyone made us feel very welcome and, overall, the food quality was superb. I would definitely return!",

Barely anything but American beers (i.e., Coors, Bud). I ended up with a Dos Equis Amber Lager--not a bad beer, but it looked like they didn't have the Special Lager. Their mixed drinks weren't bad. I had a mojito. I'd give it 3/5 stars. But again, the selection wasn't that great.   I ordered their fish tacos, and I thought they were pretty good. It came with black beans and cheese, but I was still hungry after eating my dish. For $12-14, I'd like my stomach to be filled. My advice, order the burritos or enchiladas. They looked to be a lot bigger.   My other complaint was that--and this seems to be a trend with restaurants--the appetizers cost almost as much as a meal. My friend ordered taco chips and a soup/salsa appetizer. Around $8. For chips. And salsa. Come on, mate. You're not running a Michelin 3-star joint.",

I wouldn't say the food is anything to write home about, but I've not had a bad experience here either. I've only had the apps so will comment on those. The shrimp ceviche isn't the authentic mexican or peruvian quality, but it is passable. Can't go wrong with the guac and chips and would recommend those for sure, the spicier version has jalapenos in it.  Queso dip is pretty standard but satisfies the crave. The rooftop is pleasant when the weather's nice. It's in a great location, so it's convenient for a quick or casual bite, from which you can move onto your next great adventure. It's a great meeting place, accomodates large groups, and I always see the after work crowd there to unwind. Overall, I feel like the food is in the same range as a Chili's or Applebee's, but given the vibe and location of the place, it feels like a step above.",

To be fair, I only ever come here for lunch or weekday dinner when it's not filled with drunk Shadyside girls and the \"yinzerita\" crowd (ew). I really like their tofu tacos but they definitely need extra hot sauce poured on for flavor. They give you options between REALLY American (\"gringo style\") and Mexican-ish American. They have fantastic drink specials, especially the $2 mimosas on Sunday (however, why on earth does brunch only happen until 1pm?). Prices are lower than Mad Mex and portion sizes are more friendly to non over-eaters.   Space is huge, including a rooftop deck, and I've never had real problems with the service. Ultimately, Steel Cactus is the kind of place with something for almost everyone, and a good place to bring parents.",

    "text": "Hmm...our server was nice, lol  I think that this place just needs to close for a couple of months and renovate. I hate to be too candid, but upon entering, that place smelled like a public restroom. Upon walking upstairs to the seating are, the smell faded somewhat, but not really. It was just very dense and warm in there...the place needs some ventilation.  I decided to only order chips and quac, which were actually very tastey and they give you a large portion (and we sat close to the open patio, which allowed me to breath some fresh air, if only for a minute or two). We also had the Friday $10 margarita pitcher, and it was pretty good and relatively strong! They went a little heavy on the sour mix, but I didn't mind.   Our server was super friendly and was trying to accommodate us well, so I appreciated that! But I just couldn't get over the smell and humidity. I (grudgingly) went to use the restroom and (not to my surprise) it was pretty gross. There was a giant hole in the ceiling that was leaking and splattering an unidentifiable liquid everywhere, and the toilets and stalls were old and just gross. I was ready to get out of there at that point, lol. Shout out to our cool waiter! But I wouldn't go back unless they gutted the place and renovated.",

It took quite awhile to place my order as the bartender was visiting with the servers at the far end of the bar with her back to me.

I came with a group of friends for happy hour (half off appetizers) on a random Wednesday night - it was quiet and we had no problem getting a table for 6.  the service was okay - our server was training another server and when we asked about specials, neither of them were sure what they were, but overall, they were friendly and did their job.  the food was aggressively average. I ordered the Three Amigos - one chicken, one pork and one beef taco on corn tortillas, \"cactus style\" (cabbage slaw, corn, cheese). Nothing stood out, but at half price, it wasn't terrible. We shared nachos and guacamole for the table which were also average - not bad, but not worth writing home about. One friend complained the next day of stomach problems after eating the steak quesadilla, but none of the rest of us had issues (despite some people also trying her dish).  Overall, happy hour half price apps aren't a bad deal if you're just looking for a place to catch up and eat something cheap. If you're looking for solid, authentic Mexican food, you're better off looking elsewhere.",

We picked a table among many that wasn't dirty, and the waitress eventually brought a menu. I ordered a rum drink and since we weren't too hungry we got the basic nacho appetizer and a 3 taco appetizer.   50 minutes later we finally got our appetizer. Just imagine if we had decided to order an entree. In the meantime I saw 7 other tables with 2-3 people and several waitresses milling about. No basket of chips to tide us over, small plastic water cups instead of glass (ours cracked) and saw some other people who came in later get served. And during the entire time, no one ever came over to clean the dirty tables around us, with salsa and chips spilled on them.   I didn't want to blame the waitress, who I was told by another waitress was \"doing everything she could\" to get us our nacho appetizer. Another couple who had arrived when we did with a special needs teenager who was pacing  commented to me own the way out that she had to actually had to go downstairs and find the manager to see when they were going to get their food. She was livid. I don't know if it was the cooks or the waitress, but it's times like these I regret eating out and leaving a tip.",

I've been here before a few times and never have really thought very highly of it, they just seem to cater to the college crowd and it's more of a drinks place instead of food -- today reinforced that. Brunch was awful. First, they gave us regular lunch menus and then when we asked what the brunch specials were, they took away our menus and gave us the smaller brunch menus as they don't serve from the lunch menu. Our waiter was a big part of the bad experience, he was slow and just seemed super apathetic about being there. Most of the time he was just standing at the bar seemingly doing nothing except chatting with other employees. They have a build your own tacos part of the brunch menu, you can't mix and match taco types. They were out of a few things on the menu. We started with the queso which was not very good at all, it was bland and had a bad after taste. The food did come rather quickly, unfortunately it was not very good. The chorizo in the tacos was a little rubbery probably because it had been sitting out all morning. The rice was way overcooked and the black beans had zero flavor. Overall, just a bad experience all around and won't be back. Mad Mex has it's problems as well but you'll definitely have a better time there.",

If I go to a place that calls itself a 'Mexican cantina,' I expect to not get a blank stare from waitstaff when I ask to see a tequila list. (To be fair, once they located said list, I was pleased to see that there were a couple of decent tequilas on the list. They were mostly spelled wrong, but they were on there!)  I guess I just can't understand the circumstances in which you would say, 'Hey! Let's go to Steel Cactus!' after the first time you accidentally show up there. It was crowded and hot and disorganized. We'd hoped to order food, but couldn't find a server anywhere in sight. Most people were drinking what appeared to be a huge frozen margarita with a beer bottle in it. If that's your thing, go on with it, but it kiiiiiind of grosses me out.  If I want a huge margarita, I'll go to Mad Mex. If I want authentic Mexican food, I'll go to Cuzamil. If I want good tequila, I'll go to Verde. If I want to feel old, have to pass by half a dozen bouncers to get anywhere, and watch millennials try to pick each other up, I'll go back to Steel Cactus.",

I've gotten food here numerous times and have had several bad experiences with food of questionable freshness, so now I basically just go for drinks from time to time.  With that being said I find their margaritas to be overpriced for what they are, even on happy hour special.  Their other mixed drinks are decent and are about 7 bucks.  Their happy hour deals on wine and beer are okay, but the selection marginal.  All in all, I go back because of the rooftop deck, and in truth, they probably have one of the best set-ups in Shadyside to kick back and meet up with friends.  If only the food/drinks matched the atmosphere.",

However, we only had to wait for about 5 minutes before they discovered that there was, in fact, a table available.  Anyway, after we got seated everything was much better. My sizzling fajitas were served on a very hot cast iron skillet, as they should be, and they were very tasty. The small tacos were also good. I didn't like the specialty cocktails much, though--the mango one tasted kind of like soap.  Assuming the seating service was a fluke, I'd say 4 stars.",

I don't hate Steel Cactus.  I would totally go here for happy hour or dinner, mostly because I am a Mexican food fanatic and could eat it pretty much every day (it's a convenient location for me, and sometimes one just needs a taco immediately).  If it weren't convenient, it's unlikely I'd go seeking this place out.    The best parts: the rooftop patio, and happy hour drink specials.  Kudos for that, Steel Cactus.    The least-good parts: the food is, in general, bland and unexciting.  While the price point isn't bad ($10-13 for most entrees), they could use a happy hour food special or two.  My personal preference is for more authentic, cheaper Mexican food, like Emiliano's on the South Side.",

When my Mom and I got there, we sat up in the rooftop bar area which was really nice. It was enclosed in glass since it was threatening rain all night. All the other people there for the event had ordered drinks and food, so we decided to do the same.  I was put off a little by how expensive a lot of the dishes were. I wasn't so hungry I wanted a full-out meal but even some of the appetizers were a little high. My mom and I both just ordered some chips and dips. She got the pineapple salsa and I don't think she was too crazy about it. I got the picante guacamole, which while good, was nothing to write home about. We both ordered $2.25 Blue Moons because we didn't want to pay more for drinks. I did notice some other people at this event had those Yinzeritas, which were huge. Not sure how they liked them though.  All in all, would I come back? Maybe for a drink. But the food... I don't know. Sometimes I can be a bit on the cheap side when I go out to eat. I don't normally order stuff over $10-12 unless I know it's going to be good. And based on other reviews, it's probably smart I didn't order a major meal.",

Place wasn't too crowded so that meant we got stellar service from the moment we walked in the door until we left for the night.  For not being here before, the staff were patient enough to take time and point out a few suggestions on the menu before I opted for the Pollo Queso Burrito.  The poblano/chocolate salsa that came with it, amazing.  As we waited for our food to arrive, I browsed over their drink menu and decided to go with their take on a classic, a margarita.  Typical margarita with the top shelf stuff, the first sip made me feel all warm and fuzzy, so I knew that meant the rest of the drink would do me good.    The wait staff were totally on point.  Never faulting when it came to our order, even when I requested no salt on my glass rim for the Margarita, she took it back and got me another.  She even had some time to chat with us as we waited for our food.  Even when we were done with our food and requested to leave it there as we stepped outside, she was fine with that and ensured that it would remain there until we got back.    There was just one downside.  The table.  I mean I liked the way they looked, rustic and unique.  But cleaning them has to be a difficult task.  I only say that because when I put my hand down on the table I somehow got a piece of glass stuck in one of my fingers.  But our server came to the rescue almost immediately with a band-aid in hand.  All in all, it was a great experience and I'm sure to return again.",

I've gone here several times for their happy hour and late night bar experience. For happy hour they have a ton of appetizers for half off and drinks including the mojito and yinzerita. The appetizers and drinks are just ok.  The ambiance is pretty nice during bar hours. If you don't like having smokers in your bar you could try steel cactus as no one is allowed to smoke on the main 2nd floor.

There is no reservation fee for parties, but Michele did mention that there is a spending minimum for larger parties (our reservation was for 20 people).  I loved the rooftop seating. It's open air with a clear glass/plastic roof, so that you have a view but don't have to worry if the weather turns bad.   Our server was attentive and accommodated a couple of special requests with our order. I don't like Mexican food, so I didn't eat much. But I have to say that that the queso was delicious, and my colleagues enjoyed their food. The drinks are overpriced (to be expected) but I thought they were good and rather strong.

I told him I liked fruity drinks and I get straight liquor.  We got our order, waited five minutes to get silverware and by that time my six shrimp that were in my flour tortilla (too bad I ordered corn tortillas) were cold. The rice was dried out, the beans were straight from the can with a little Parmesan cheese on top. I watched the male bartender throw ice across the bar length wise hitting some guests sitting at the bar. Then I proceeded to watch him make a mix drink and right when he strains the drink; he uses his fingers to cover the mouth of the container and use his fingers as a stopper for the ice. My experience was terrible. The bartender said right before he gave us our check 'should I get my manager over here for you so you can bitch more about me?' I replied ' ya, that'd be nice!'

    "text": "I don't get to come here as much as I would like to, however when I have business in the area I always make time to stop in or meet up with clients here for drinks.  It's a pretty cool spot and the food does what I need it to.  While the decor far from screams Mexican in anyway I'm pretty okay with that.  I can't think of a restaurant I went to specifically for the vibe since I was a kid.  And that restaurant was chucky cheese.  I do like how everything is set up.  It's got a really modern clean look to it.  I like that they open the windows when it's nice out.  No reason to waste a beautiful day.  Saturday for lunch I met up with a client at the bar.  The bartender, a tall pretty brunette who was very friendly, took our order and got them back pretty promptly.  I ordered a party platinum.  When I come here I like that I get drinks that are well mixed and actually give me pleasure when drinking them instead of some liquor with something to water it down.  I'd have to recommend the party platinum  One thing I like about the \"modern\" mexican restaurant is that they try to change things up a bit.  I mean there's only so much you can do with tortillas, beef, beans, and sour cream.  I usually get the carne asada tacos but was looking for something a bit different this time around.  I asked the bartender and she recommended the polo enchiladas.  I can honestly say it's one of the best things on the menu and a new favorite of mine.  Even though the place was somewhat busy we were taken very well care of and I didn't have to wait half an hour to get my check like I do at the elbow room down the street.  All in all the steel cactus is one of my favorite spots to frequent when I'm in the shadyside area whch unfortunately isn't frequent enough.",

The pulled chicken in the De Muerte was perfectly seasoned and the burrito was full of cilantro and jalapeno peppers - definitely lived up to its 'spicy' distinction.  The picante guacamole was plentiful (not very spicy, though) & the salsa was terrific. The frozen traditional margarita was one of the better ones I've had & my craft beer-loving husband found several options that made him happy.  The staff was all very welcoming, friendly and attentive without being over-bearing.  It was a positive experience all around -  we'll definitely be back !",

    "text": "Oh Steel Cactus, where do I start?    When we walked in for an early dinner this place was pretty empty. Even though it was so empty there were a good 15-20 staff members just hanging around. Some were at the bar, five or six were at the hostess stand and still more were standing around outside of the kitchen. I have never seen so many employees in such a small restaurant. When one of the hostess' finally decided that she was going to seat us we asked for a booth. It took three more requests before she actually seated us at a booth though. She tried to sit us on the deck (it was about to storm, really?) and then she tried to sit us at a table and then she tried to sit us at another table. So finally, we got a booth. The table was sticky and greasy and so were the menus.   We ordered the appetizer trio where you can pick three dips to order. We got the guacamole, queso and pineapple salsa. It was lackluster to say the least. When I was a kid my sisters and I would cook for our family once a week. We really young so often times our meals were pretty much inedible but our parents were good sports and ate the terrible food we provided. The queso dip at Steel Cactus reminds me of a particularly disgusting concoction my sister created that consisted of salsa and Kraft cheese slices melted in a bowl to make spicy cheese dip. It was plasticy, tasteless and seemed solid as a rock. the guacamole was tasteless and generally disappointing. It had giant (I mean like a third of an avocado) chunks of avocado in it. The pineapple salsa was interesting. It tasted exactly like pineapple, which would maybe be interesting if they got different chips to go with it. The chips. Let's talk about those for a second. It seemed to me that somebody took normal chips and gave them a salt rub. They were not good unless you are into super salty chips..   Our main courses were OK. I had the San Jose burrito. Our waiter, who genuinely seemed to be a really nice guy and was a good waiter, said that people love the San Jose sauce. Love it! I did not love it. It tasted like they take unripened tomato and mash it up. I'm not a huge tomato person to begin with. Luckily the San Jose sauce was on the side so I was able to just abandon it.  The chicken in my burrito was acceptable and even varied to the good side of things. The rice in my burrito was salty, very salty, and I would get a bite every once in a while that had rice that was undercooked. The ride had litter flavor. the menu said it was cilantro rice in the burrito so I thought GREAT! It'll be like Chipotle rice. WRONG! No flavor at all and I'm not even sure I tasted cilantro in any of the dishes I tried. Everything just tasted like salt. Speaking of salty, let's talk about the salt content at this place.    I don't really cook with salt. I don't use a lot of salt. It's just not a flavor that I find appealing. Steel Cactus loves salt. Everything I had there was slathered in it. The chips practically had a shell made of salt. The chicken was salty, the rice was extremely salty.  I felt like a rabbit with a salt block. Honestly, I went through a few glasses of water with dinner and it wasn't because the food was spicy (which is normally why I would drink so much water at a Mexican restaurant), it was because I was trying to flush the salt out of my system.   The service was OK. Our waiter was really very nice and he was very attentive but not hovering too closely over us.  Random members of the staff would flutter by from time to time because there really weren't enough customers to justify so many staff members being there.   Let's take a minute and talk about the bathroom. It was OK, clean enough but the thing that really pushed me over the greasy tabled edge into hysterical laughter was the sign in the bathroom asking patrons to please hold the lever down until the \"toilette\" had flushed completely. Really? Toilette? If you need to have a sign up asking people to hold the lever down, you are not a nice enough restaurant to throw extra letters onto the word toilet.    My favorite thing about this whole experience was that they gave us a customer loyalty card. Yep, because I definitely want to come back and have my sodium intake for the year again!  I will just say this, I have always considered the Shadyside area to be sort of a college hangout. So if I were still in college and had consumed a lot of alcohol, the Steel Cactus would be the perfect place to go soak up some of the booze in my stomach with salty burritos and plastic queso dip.",

The food is spicier, the cocktail list is lengthier, and the roof top...well, the roof top has always been amazing (and definitely the key component that added the 4th star for this review :)  The roof has been constructed to allow it to be opened during warm summer nights, but water proof during the fall and winter.  Heat lamps adorn the majority of the space, so every spot is cozy!  The charred tomato and sweet corn salsa ias amazing, as is the freshly prepared guacamole and chipotle salsas- I couldn't get enough!  The pollo tacos and carnitas tacos were both well spiced and flavorful.  A new item on their menu is the crispy tofu taco- a must try for non-meat lovers!!   For cocktails, we tried the skinny-rita (didn't taste skinny at all!) and the premium margarita (delish).  Will definitely be coming back to sample more of the cuisine...and, of course, to enjoy the roof.",

I am not one to complain and I will make this brief. My boyfriend and I went to your establishment around 10 pm Saturday night. We were seated by the hostess table and sat there for quite a while. I looked, made eye contact, and smiled at a server but after watching her walk by us four times I realized she wasn't our server. While waiting to get her attention prior to ordering many other tables were sat. The server eventually came over and asked what we would like to order. This server was indeed the same girl that I attempting to get service from initially. She apologized and was happy to take our order. I ordered queso, a pollo burrito without pico and and a yinzarita. She promptly came back with the queso and informed me that it was going to be about 15 minutes to make my drink. She then asked if I wanted something else. I said no and that I would wait.  There were three females who also ordered yinzaritas. I know they were seated after us because I thought about asking to be moved to that table. We got our food and I still had not received my drink. The server did come over once more and tell me it would be a few more minutes. I had pretty much finished my food and I realized the girls at the other table were all sipping yinzaritas. After a few minutes the server came back again, said it would only be a few more minutes and I asked her to just cancel my order.  I mentioned the girls having their drinks to my boyfriend and he (being passive as always) said, yeah, I was hoping you didn't notice that. I didn't ask for a manager or complain to the server I just wanted out of the restaurant. That was the second time eating at Steel Cactus and we had issues with rude staff before. The manager was more than polite but it doesn't make up for a bad experience. We will not be coming back to your restaurant. I hope eventually, you get either new staff or retraining needs to be implemented. I will be telling my friends about my poor experience and the few people I've already told have then told me their bad experiences with your restaurant. Good luck, with your reputation because its going downhill fast.",

Ordered chips and queso and a beer, which was thumbs up. I like how their chips are seasoned. I ordered the chicken tacos but the food lacked flavor. The chimichanga dessert though was the bomb! The second time we ordered chips and guacamole traditional, which was (standard) delicious. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the salmon and pineapple ceviche and I was not a fan at all. The ceviche was a big bowl of mush by the time I received and the flavors did not meld well together. Also we tried to order Dos Equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer. And while the waitress didn't charge us for that draft beer she handed us a bottle of Dos Equis and charged us for that, as oppose to asking if we wanted another type of beer. What a bummer as had high hopes for Steel Cactus.",

You have to walk up a few flights of steps once you get there but this place has some cool decor and two floors of seating. The top floor is the roof and my friend and I decided that a second flight up was worth it to enjoy a perfect day.   This trip to Steel Cactus was purely in the name of happy hour. Too bad we were there a little early for happy hour (starts at 5PM) so we couldn't get the reduced price.  No worries, that wouldn't stop me from ordering Pumking on tap!  We decided to share an order of chicken nachos to offset the high ABV content of said Pumking and I'd rate the nachos a 2.5 out of 5. Definitely not the best ever.   I don't often mention restrooms in my reviews but I must say the bathroom at Steel Cactus was sparkling clean. Like, you could eat your nachos off the floor clean. Also, good friendly service to be found here.   Good happy hour destination and if the weather is nice I highly recommend heading up to the roof.",

Catch their happy hour, which doesn't end till 7pm.  Nibble on whatever their daily special is.  Enjoy the lively atmosphere, and possibly use their photobooth, tucked away by the bathrooms.    The food was just ok and the margarita very \"from-a-mix\" tasting, which is the main reason I'm giving 3 stars.  Generic mexican food, nothing special.  (I'm pretty biased and picky about mexican food.  Usually, I'll reserve mexican food for trips back to Texas or California.).  But again, I stress that this would probably only be a place I go for casual meet ups over drinks.  Don't be expecting the most authentic best tasting mexican fare.  Service is pretty good, considering the high pace/bar atmosphere.  The bartenders are always hustling around during happy hour, so they're very quick and no-nonsense.  But definitely not rude.  The last time I was in, there were a few credit card technical difficulties and also some order mixups, but they were handled very quickly and the bartender was very apologetic.",

    "text": "Went there for lunch yesterday. There were very few tables when we arrived yet it still took a while to be greeted by our waiter. We ordered the queso con chorizo appetizer which I've gotten before and loved. It was actually the reason that I selected Steel Cactus for lunch--I was craving the queso. The appetizer came out and the cheese was bright yellow--looked like velveeta and tasted awful. When the waiter came over I asked if the recipe had changed. He stated that the recipe had not changed but was sometimes inconsistent?? Not sure exactly what that meant.  I told him we didn't want the queso because it just wasn't good. He apologized and took it back to the kitchen. Within 5 minutes he brought back a new bowl of the queso which was white in color and tasted the way it was supposed to. I'm still so confused as to what and why we were served the first mess. Then as I was about to take a drink from my iced tea, my boyfriend asked what was in the glass. It was a piece of sticky paper stuck to the inside of my glass--which I had drank out of several times already. Gross.  I've been to Steel Cactus about 6 times prior to yesterday and always had a good experience. In fact, yesterday was my birthday and this is where I opted to dine. Needless to say, it was a disappointment.",

The rooftop is so fun to hang out with family and friends, and during the week their happy hour is awesome! It's $3 glasses of wine and $5 specialty cocktails, which is an awesome deal. I've had the food, and it was absolutely average. Nothing to rave about, because it was kind of bland. However, I'll definitely go back for the good atmosphere and the drinks!!",

It's tastefully decorated and has a very relaxing atmosphere. Great music playing in the background. Steady stream of people but it didn't feel overly crowded. We were here during the week, so I imagine it must get quite packed on the weekends by the young college crowd in the area.   Drinks were okay. I felt like my margarita could've been a little stronger, but it was fine. Our server was great both times. The second time I wish they would have closed the windows. After awhile if your sitting too close to the outdoors, you wish you had a warmer jacket even for a summer night.   We ordered a dessert on one of our visits. It was okay, but I can't say it was all that impressive. Just okay. Much better than any Chevy's out West where I live. But I think they wouldn't be first on my list if I wanted truly authentic Mexican food experience. It's mostly about the nice atmosphere, fun music, and people you're hanging out with that make this a memorable experience.",

We were without drinks for extended periods of time and waited over 40 minutes for our food. When it finally came out, my tacos were ice cold and my friends nachos were also cold. Who wants to eat cold nachos? We had to send our meals back and they were re-heater obviously not re-made. This would have been fine, had they not burned my hard taco shells. At this point I decided to not even bother saying anything because it just was not worth it. They did deduct a percentage off our bills for the cold food, but The icing on the cake was that all of our bills were incorrect. My bill had my friends beers on it, which was annoying, but I still didn't bother with it because we really wanted to leave. Overall, just come here for margaritas, don't even bother with the food.",

Our table was set then no one came to tell us we could be seated, so we had to ask if we were allowed to sit down.  The manager gave us a complimentary pitcher of margaritas (nice gesture) but they were no good, not mixed well and barely any alcohol in them.  Like I said, guac was good.  After waiting almost an hour for our food, the tacos were pretty bland, some luke warm and some cold, none of them were hot at all.  Not a good experience here.",

I was about to order a second, when my friend advised me otherwise, as he had been waiting half an hour for his. So I asked for my check instead. And waited. And waited. I asked the waitress a second time for my check. She said as soon as she gets a minute she'd bring it. (It had been about 20 Minutes.) 10 minutes later she came back and asked about what appetizers should be put on which bill. #1- these are questions that should have been asked half an hour ago. 2-At least one of those items should have been comped considering the wait time, and their errors in our service. The wrong food was brought out, the wrong drinks were made. All of which we accepted with an understanding smile. But that question put us all over the edge of patience. We all had to put more time on our meters...simply because we were waiting for our check.   The food was adequate, but nothing Mad Mex hasn't done better for years. The service was exceptionally awful. Don't be a bar in Shadyside on a Friday night if you cannot handle a Friday night crowd in Shadyside. I understand being understaffed, but this was beyond inexcusable. We all felt completely ignored and disrespected. Won't be going back, and neither will any of the 7 people I was with. But given the way we were treated, Steel Cactus won't be missing us, either.",

Chips are also always fresh and never have that stale bite to them.

Service is awesome, everyone is friendly and we usually get seated and served rather quickly!   Atmosphere is awesome with 2 levels of seating and when it is warm they open the roof and windows to take in the views of walnut street in shadyside.

Vegetarian options should NOT include tofu  There are many ways to do vegetarian Mexican dishes that don't involve meat substitutes. And if you want to do meat substitutes, seitan and tempeh are way better in the context of a taco or burrito.  If you are absolutely set on doing tofu, crumble it (a la Chipotle). Cubes of tofu do not have the right texture at all for a Mexican dining experience.  Given my background, I order instead the 3 peppers burrito, which is always solid. The service is good, as is the drink selection. I also think the prices are fair. Therefore, Steel Cactus gets a solid 3.",

Would give 0 stars if I could--do yourself a favor and never come here for breakfast/brunch.  Steel Cactus used to have good breakfast with fresh eggs and enormous fluffy pancakes. My visit today was extremely unpleasant.   The pancake was not only smaller, but the batter was gritty and had an off taste to it. Also they definitely made the pancakes on the same grill as the ones they cook their meat.   Also they must have thought that using powdered eggs while charging the same amount of money is okay. The scrambled \"eggs\" were cold, gritty, dry and chalky. Definitely the most disgusting thing I received today.   Disappointment really, since this was a nice alternative to standing in line at other breakfast places on Walnut",

We ordered mimosas with warm orange juice and almost no champaign.  We had to request that the table be cleaned.  We had to ask for plates, flatware and serving spoons.

We've been nothing but pleasant and cheerful, just wanted to be able to review the actual food!  We're outta here.",

I mean, they offer margarita's with beer bottles stuck out the side of them!  How do you take that seriously?!  I can tell you how.  By the quality of their roja (roma) tomato salsa, which I could not get enough of.  Or their (Camarones) shrimp taco's, which I ate every bite of.  Or their black beans, which I never usually touch, that I ate half of (big feat I know!).  Although delicious, my pineapple cocktail probably could have been non-alcoholic with the amount of liquor included.  I might order a marg next time, or perhaps just a brew.  Or both, apparently!  Sure, maybe it looks a bit like they've replicated a Mad Mex, but it's a Burgh staple, how can you not?  Add in the huge rooftop balcony, toted s the highest in Shadyside, and I'm a happy little burrito.  I believe that means I'm wrapped in a warm embrace of delicious Mexican food and I'm happy!",

It's literally the WORST tacos I have ever had - the chicken was bland, the beef tasted funny and the carnitas was barely acceptable. I also got this in a soft corn tortilla, and they only wrap the fillings with one so the tacos break apart super easily. I basically forced myself to eat one taco and then couldn't do it anymore because it tasted so bad. DON'T GET THEIR FOOD. Their drinks are decent and are probably the only things I will order from there.",

The atmosphere indoors is loud and bar like.  My major complaint is that Steel Cactus is overpriced for serving the same quality of food as Chipotle, but the prices are double.  I wouldn't chose to come back here on my own, but I guess I would think about returning.  At $12 for 3 regular sized tacos and $11 for a burrito, I would say it's just ok but nothing special.",

    "text": "So I used to love going to steel cactus solely for the vibe and rooftop bar, especially in the warmer months.  The atmosphere has always been laid back and not so \"collegey\" as other bars which I loved.  Recently, a group of us decided to get drinks there before getting ready for a wedding event.  This was earlier in the day around noon. This is the time we first encountered a not so nice hostess.  She was very stand offish but we continued to the rooftop.  The bartender up there was very attentive and did a wonderful job.  We just had basic mimosas which were alright and bloody Marys which were below average.  The sun was pretty intense that day so a lot of our friends wanted to move out of the sun downstairs.  We had to go get one of our phones fixed at the apple store and called it a day and left, but when the phone took longer than expected we decided to go back into SC but on the regular restaurant level.  Now mind you, at this point in the day there was maybe one to two full tables of people, that's it.  It was DEAD. We wanted to get more drinks but there wasn't enough seats clustered together at the bar so we asked this hostess if we could just sit at the table because clearly none were being used.  We realized (as she so rudely explained) that tables were for people who are eating, but Since there were no other customers we didn't see a problem.  I have never met a hostess who was so blatantly rude for no good reason seeing we were very nice and understanding while talking to her.  With angry sighs, multiple eye rolls, and an attitude she basically shrugged us off and told us to do what we wanted.  We ended up standing at a high table by the bar in the corner to where we were greeted with more rude eye rolls from one of the waitresses.  But guess what...it didn't even get busy to where we were hindering other customers eating.    Other than that bad experience, I've always had an okay time at steel cactus.  Their food is okay, I definitely wouldn't choose it as a place to get Mexican food.",

We went as a group of 10 celebrating a special occasion on a Friday night. Our waitress was SO RUDE. She rolled her eyes every time we made a request which was mostly because she messed up our order and we waited over 15 minutes for bottled beers to be delivered to the table. When one of us walked up to the hostess stand to ask for a toothpick, she said that she didn't know if they had any and instead of asking someone or going to check, she went back to chatting with a guy hanging out near by.         There was no soap in the men's bathroom from the time that we got there until the time that we left. OVER 2 HOURS! Which means any of the employees using the bathroom were unable to wash their hands. We even witnessed one employee leaving a bathroom stall and bypassing the sink entirely. DISGUSTING!     When we asked to speak to a manager, we waited over 20 minutes before finally just leaving. Clearly the management is as sub-par as the service and employee standards.        We will definitely NOT be back!!",

It was packed on a Friday and CMU was having an event there so the drinks took a little longer than the food, but.....SOOOO what?

I came in for lunch this past Friday, and had the same sentiment as the people I had talked to. I feel like my experience at most Mexican restaurants can be predicted by my experience with the guacamole, and this held True at Steel Cactus. The gauc was neither good nor bad - while the avocado seemed fresh, the flavor wasn't great, and the guac itself was pretty bland. I had the soup of the day - Lobster Bisque - as that is one of my favorite soups. There was quite a bit of lobster in it, but the flavor was lacking. I also had the chance to try the Chicken Soup, which had a bit of a kick, but I still wasn't particularly impressed. The Veggie Burrito was decent, although again, nothing that left me wanting me.   All of that being said, I would still come back because the venue is so incredible. They have done a great job renovating the place. The rooftop is amazing and they have now winter-proofed it to a degree so they can keep it open as the weather changes. The bar is also very unique and decorated nicely. Although I was a bit disappointed in the beer selection, they have a full bar.",

    "text": "First entering the restaurant you get a pretty cool vibe of the atmosphere with dark colors, bright lights, interesting tables and designs and music at a loud but good volume. We went on a Friday night, and it seems to be a popular choice, so for the weekend seems like a good place to hang out not necessary a sit down dinner. Service was quick in asking what we would like to drink. On a side note, it is interesting for a Mexican Cantina to have a low selection of Mexican beers, and being hispanic and new here from California it is sad when the waitresses has trouble pronouncing them, not to say she wasn't nice, our waitress was very friendly.   For the meals, the menu was a bit limited, pretty much tacos and burritos were the option to eat with a couple different selections. Missing an assortment of authentic meals that come to mind.  We ended up ordering a Mango and Shrimp civiche appetizer which tasted a bit different from normal civiche but it was definitely a flavorful experience. After looking over the menu, we ended up going for the shrimp and Carne Asada meal and what I believe called the chicken burrito de muerte (named for its \"spiceyness\"). The food was from ok to pretty good. The Carne Asada plate has very good sauce poured on top of the shrimp and steak and it overall was cooked great and tasted wonderful, For some reason they grilled onions and left a big pile on one side of the plate, kind of confusing, didn't seem to go with the carne asada or the mexican rice with the plate, maybe a better idea if they chose to put a side of beans instead.  The burrito was stuffed with rice and cheese, and could have used a lot more shredded chicken but it has a good taste. Came with chipotle sauce and sour cream. And for being a burrito de muerte, I sensed no spice at all, this opinion seconded by my pregnant wife. Though the chipotle was delightful.   Of the three options for dessert, we went with the deef fried banana cheesecake with vanilla ice cream. The appearance was nice and totally through us off, we thought we were served chimichangas. Ended up the dessert was great! Very sweet and flavorful, went great with the ice cream.   Overall with a great atmosphere and shopping near by, I would suggest coming for sit down dinner or lunch during the week. I cant say about going out for a beer or to hang out, but by the appearance of the crowd and the vibe of everyone, seems like a good choice. If you want AUTHENTIC, this is not the place to go. BUT it is good food and good prices. Appetizer, dinner for two, dessert, and drinks came out to a little more then $50.",

I recently went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. They have $2 mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar. The food was excellent as well. And the best part was it wasn't crowded at all! Definitely beats waiting in line at Pamela's or Cafe Moulin.",

The location seems good though. The bar has a lot of space around it, and I assume the patio is quite nice.",

    "text": "Multiple take out orders, never right. Last time (6 weeks ago) I picked up on my way to work around 9p and it wasn't even close to right but I was already gone by the time I looked in the bag. Called back and they told me I had \"a week\" to go back to claim a new meal. Not likely to happen, sorry; especially only within A WEEK!!! I also recently went for drinks on the top deck and waited well over 20 mins despite there being only maybe 20-30 people up there and 3 people behind the bar, 2 of whom were just washing glasses. They really, really need a manager. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry before, there just is no supervision and it seems this is another top-down disaster in Shadyside. Great concept, poor execution",
