Service has been outstanding every time I've visited. The staff is inviting and knowledgable. I don't think I've ever seen the frown.   3. THE FOOD IS LIKE NOTHING ELSE! I ordered a chicken dish which a never do out at the recommendation of my server. It was by far the best chicken I've ever had. We also ordered the scallops and the short ribs at her recommendation and we were not let down.   Over all, it was a wonderful experience and we will be back for our 3rd visit.",

It was 6 slices and just enough for us to have with our drinks. Our server, Sullivan, was very attentive and knew about everything on the menu! He described the each item in detail and made it all sound very tasty. He also made us special drinks based on our preferences. This was by far the best service and food experience I've had at a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. It is also a very nice venue, with low lights and black and white silent films play throughout the day. I will definitely be back to try more food and drinks.",

The food was not prepared well either and the menu items were not what you would expect.  We got corned beef hash and eggs Benedict, but the Benedict was over cooked and over whole wheat english muffins with thick ham.  The corned beef  was cooked separate from the hash browns.  And the hashbrowna were burnt and over peppered all around.  The toast was server without any butter or jelly.  Overall it was bad.  Pergaps, it's because this is a hotel restaurant attached to the Hilton Garden Inn, but beware.",

None in our party eat pork for religious reasons and when we got the daikon sauerkraut it clearly had pork in it which is not mentioned on the menu. All the sides from what I recall were vegetables. In this day and age with dietary restrictions commonplace, listing that the veggie has meat should be mentioned in the menu. Waitress and manager were apologetic and gave us another side. I also thought for the money, the entrees were a bit on the small side",

We were greeted immediately upon arrival my niece said \"this place is NICE\". It was a beautiful spring day in PA so we grabbed seats by the open garage door seating area. These seats were like sitting right outside (I'm sure this seating isn't for everyone ) but I'm all about being outdoors lol. The price points on the food are great not to pricey. We shared the bucket of fried chicken and the garlic Parmesan fries . The fried chicken was served in a bucket which I thought was cute. The chicken was fried to perfection but the thing that took it to another level was the raspberry dipping sauce that accompanied it. It was a kicked up sweet and sour sauce with a lil heat. We had to request extra sauce it was that yummy. The garlic Parmesan fries were delish. If your in market square and looking for something refreshing and hip I would recommend Revel&Roost!",

    "text": "Because of our positive experience at the Revel, we decided to try the Roost on Thanksgiving Day. It's hard to imagine this interpretation of a traditional Thanksgiving meal. The entrees and sides were served in small soup bowls, three bowls on trays with no serving utensils, and we were each given a tapas plate. We sent the gravy back because it was not hot and we ended up picking on the \"bite-size\" pieces of dark meat. We tasted the sides, but we never tasted the turkey breast or ham which appeared dry. We packaged nearly the entire dinner ourselves. So basically, my husband had soup, a glass of wine, a dessert, and I had a kale salad and two glasses of wine. We gave the food I packaged away to a homeless person outside the restaurant.  The base price of the Roost was $17 per person higher than The Capital Grille, where we completely enjoyed our Thanksgiving 2015 dinner. The Roost will be remembered by us as the worst Thanksgiving dinner in our 60 some years.  We should have voiced our concerns to the server at the time but instead communicated with the manager by email afterwards. We were offered a gift card to Roost, not Revel, but declined. Why would we go back?",

We started downstairs for drinks which were good bartender was good too.  At 650 we were taken upstairs to roost for our sit down dinner.  We sat for 15 minutes before any person came over to our table.  Finally , bob, our server came over an absolutely sweaty mess and apologized because he had a larger table that was consuming his time.  He did however comp our drinks for this; ok cool.  At this point it was 20 minutes since we were sat so we decided what we wanted for dinner.  He came back with drinks and said \"I'm going to go check on my other table and will come back for your order.\" We pretty much knew at this point it was going south quickly.  Ten minutes later bob came back, dripping with sweat again, telling me of his time spent with his other tables; I wasn't really interested in hearing it so I placed our entire order at once .  The ahi Tuna poke was amazing! I got the ribeye Med rare which came out med well and over charred on an extremely large plate with a random sweet pepper and a RAW mini onion that was absolutely disgusting ; at this moment I cannot understand why a raw onion was on the plate.  I would be embarrassed to be the chef to serve that. A $33 steak looked quite half ass to be honest ; it was torn apart and over cooked by a good five minutes.  My wife got the filet medium and came out med rare.  Again , the steak was solo on a giant plate with the sweet pepper (bonus, this one was orange lol) and the famous, RAW mini onion.....I was embarrassed for them.  The mashed potato were pretty good ; the baked beans however .......WOW; beans were raw and clearly over spiced.  No balance in flavor and just gross; It was like chomping on mini rocks . They clearly had no clue how to soak beans and/or cook them.  Bob didn't deliver our meals (another server did) , didn't ask once how the steaks were cooked as I immediately would have sent them both back.  He asked about ten minutes later how it was again apologizing for his absence.  I hate complaining but for a total bill of $105.00 it better be god damn PERFECT and it was farrrrrrr away from that .  I'd compare it to ruby Tuesday's and that's being generous .  I myself have waited tables for 10 years, so I get it. However I would never straight up complain to my customers about how needy my other tables are as an excuse to not giving good service to them. A complete and utter disappointment on Christmas Eve!",

After waiting over 45 minutes for our food, my daughter found our server to mention we had tickets to a play and politely ask if he thought we  would be getting our food soon. About 15 minutes later our food arrived.  I ordered the special eggs Benedict and requested my eggs to be very well down specifically with no run or \"dip\" as they say around here.  The dish was to be braised beef served in potato skins which had a pool of oil inside. The braised beef was more like left over pieces of warmed up steak. It was tough and dry.  When I cut into my eggs, the yolk ran over my plate and the hollandaise was not much more than a teaspoon of watered down cream with no lemon flavor.  My daughter had the pork and said it was just ok. We both were disappointed snd certainly will not be back. I do not recommend!",

We made a reservation and told the hostess (who was a chef stepping in to help) about it and he sent us upstairs (bottom floor is lunch, top floor is breakfast/brunch) but we wanted lunch food so we had to go back downstairs. We were seated shortly after. Our waiter was new so we excused the slow service. Our food took longer than normal to get. I ordered the chicken & apple panini and was a little bit disappointed. There was a lot bread and not a lot of meat/apple/other. We told our waiter we wanted separate checks but someone else placed 1 check on the table at the end. It took our waiter and the manager to discuss how to split it.... Wasn't bad but wasn't the best. Probably better as a happy hour spot.",

No ones fault, sometimes water doesn't taste that great from the tap. I substituted it with soda water and that was fine. I ordered a salad with vegetables and goat cheese, creamed corn, and twice baked fingerling potatoes minus the bacon. All the food was pretty tasty. My only suggestion would be more flavor in the potatoes, but I'm the one who ordered them without bacon so that's on me. The presentation was lovely. I'd be curious to try some other options here.

    "text": "When my job first moved our offices to nearby Market Square from the USX Tower, my co-workers and I were heartbroken.  Aside from the Primanti Bros, The Oyster House, Dunkin Donuts and Bruegger's Bagels, you were hard pressed to find anything else.  Fast forward a few years and when I was moved back to the USX Tower, I was devastated.  Most of the restaurant choices of my dreams were in or around Market Square and I would now have to hike to get to any of them.  So needless to say, I was dismayed that yet another new restaurant was opening near Market Square and I was posted near a vast restaurant wasteland. (Yes, there are restaurants in my office complex, but the variety is not that varied and how many time scan you eat the same things over and over and over, again?)  Anyhow, I went to lunch at Revel + Roost with a friend of mine and neither of us had been there.  She ordered the Market Vegetable Salad (Single-$7) with seasonal vegetables, romaine and endive spears, goat cheese, peppercress, honey dijon vinaigrette and added grilled salmon.($10).  I ordered the Salmon Sandwich ($12) served on a brioche bun with lettuce, tomato and house made tartar sauce.  My friend also ordered the House-made Chips and I ordered the Hand-cut Fries with Garlic and fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  I must return to suck up additional food and ambiance.  We both loved our food and we loved the service...  And just like me, my friend is a sucker for decor aesthetics.  Why can't we have anything like this in the eastern suburbs???    Pittsburgh is really stepping up their restaurant game.  Thank you Jesus for restaurants like this and others for not subjecting us to endless rounds of pizza!",

We were kind of caught off guard when we were told to go upstairs, bc the live music was downstairs. We obliged. There was one other woman upstairs and the bartender said he was closing shortly. Still confused why we were sent upstairs, we sit down.   Bob was the bartender and I must say he is an absolute delight! Whether it was the booze, ambiance, or just good conversation we all started chit chatting and lost track of time.   Also, the upstairs has private meeting rooms and is five times bigger than I even imagined. Bob did give a flyer for happy hr which looks amazing! We will definitely be back to try the food!",

We ordered 2 soups, fries and a green salad to share. The salad was old and slimy- just a few old slices of cucumber and baby tomatoes were here as garnish. The soups were ok: my chicken soup tasted like canned soup. The waiter was very cordial during this experience and they didn't charge us for the salad. It was still a waste of time and money!",

    "text": "Beware of the upstairs/upsell! And they don't respond to customer emails...  A friend and I visisted Revel & Roost before a show last week after our prior plans fell through.  We knew nothing about Revel & Roost, and had selected it based on seeing seats available at open table (and having walked past it previously and seeing a casual bar setting on the ground level).  When we arrived, we saw folks having pizzas, etc. in the lively area by the bar.  Then we were taken upstairs by the hostess, without any explanation of the concept of the restaurant (which now we know after looking it up after dining).  We just thought that she was taking us to a quieter area.    When we were seated (the atmosphere is lovely), there was again no explanation of the concept of the restaurant - that the upstairs is more upscale dining and the downstairs is casual (and a lot lower price point). We were not asked what we would prefer or what we had intended our reservation to be for.  After were were seated, it took the server 10 minutes to acknowledge us, though she had only one other table.  There was no explanation of the menu.  My friend ordered a salad and an entree, and I ordered the ribeye and a side of the potato gratin.  The salad came out, and then the bread.  While the bread was good, there were no bread plates.  Since I didn't currently have a dish in front of me (as I didn't get a starter), there was no place to set my bread between bites, and there were crumbs that stayed there the entire meal.  The steak was a little disappointing for the price- it was on the thinner side for a ribeye, and had a lot of gristle.  We had walked out of the restaurant and my friend forgot her coat upstairs.  While waiting for her, I saw the \"downstairs\" menu posted- much different than upstairs, with more reasonable choices.  I felt as if our lack of familiarity with the concept allowed the staff to \"upsell\" us upstairs withour our knowing, and without offering us a choice.  We were too embarassed and confused to say anything.  The following day, I sent an email to the email address listed on their website, providing feedback on our experience.  I held out on writing this Yelp review to allow them a chance to respond, but they never did.",

Anytime I eat at a hotel restaurant (which is rare) I immediately lower my expectations, assuming it will be an overpriced, mediocre meal. Well, my expectations were met because that's pretty much what we got...but with a nice view.  I went with the Great American Breakfast, where you can pick on entree, one side, one bread and coffee and juice. Sounded easy to I opted for the French toast, bacon and English muffin (because I apparently really needed the extra carbs). It also came with both coffee and juice, which was rare, but nice.  The cinnamon swirl French toast wasn't anything special or sizable; the bacon was slightly overdone, and the English muffin looked like it was taken straight from a bag and put on to the plate...not toasted or buttered. Huh...seriously?  Again, it wasn't utterly horrible, but for $15.95 it was easily the most expensive, yet unsatisfying breakfast I've had in a long time.",

The place is very nice and we were overlooking Forbes avenue. Service was great. We were in and out with a 3 course meal in an hour.. I know these places usually keep you there a little longer but I was ok to get the food and have some drinks, and get out into the square for some more drinks.   I had the short ribs for an app which were great. They melted in your mouth and had a little bit of BBQ sauce on them which was awesome. My girlfriend started with the salad with vinegarette which was small, but she said tasty. We both got a fillet and lobster tail which were both cooked perfectly. There were no complaints there. It was accompanied by green beans and mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent. For dessert, she got the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream which was amazing. I was too full to eat my s'more dessert and forgot it at the restaurant.   The only thing that went wrong was I had a bug in my first drink I ordered. Sitting right on top in the hole of the ice cube. I was quick to get a new drink though. Also, they dropped salad on my shoe.... I'd come back here for another visit during non restaurant week for sure. Check it out!",

I sat at the bar for 15 minutes. 4 employees came back there but none said a word, much less handed me a menu or water. It appeared they were servers and no one was actually responsible for the bar. Several others were waiting unattended. I walked out. Plenty of other options on the square. This place has a culture issue. Skip it.",

This was my very first experience in Pittsburgh. I'd never been there and was told it was a great city for food. So I searched around for places that were open for brunch on Christmas Eve. We didn't make brunch, which is fine, but the lunch menu has a lot of amazing items on it.    We ordered the communal shrimp & grits (which were VERY salty), a brisket sandwich, Brussels sprouts and a burger. There's NO way all of that food took 45 minutes to cook. The longest dish was the burger for obvious reasons and even that shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.   If they were busy I would have understood but we were the only people there.

Aside from those issues, it was apparent to me that they had some talent in the kitchen. The presentation and the quality of the dishes were spot on.

My mom shared some of her garlic and Parmesan fries with me and they were to die for, still salty and just the right amount of garlic.

We had made reservations for 6:15 PM earlier in the day and arrived to the restaurant a few minutes early.  That didn't matter as it wasn't really full and we were immediately taken upstairs to our table.  You see Revel and Roost is actually a two restaurant in the same building concept.  Revel is a little more casual and bar like and sits on the first floor while Roost is a little fancier and sits on the second floor.  Since it was after Thanksgiving the restaurants were decorated for Christmas and looked quite nice.  For dinner on this evening our table decided to start out with the artisan cheese.  The appetizer consisted of four different cheeses including a blue, a Brie, a cheese made with Porter and a white cheese all along with some cherry compote and crostinis.  Overall it was pretty good and I enjoyed all of the cheeses with my only complaint being that they could have given us some more crostinis.  Then for my dinner I ended up ordering the cavatelli with duck confit with a side of the braised red cabbage.  The cavatelli came out with a big piece of crispy duck skin in the top and a cream sauce.  It was very enjoyable as the somewhat salty cream sauce paired nicely with the duck and pasta while the duck skin gave the dish some nice and crunchy texture.  After I had finished with my pasta I dug into the red cabbage.  For some reason I had it in my mind that it was going to be a German sweet and sour red cabbage, however that wasn't the case.  Instead it was a nicely braised red cabbage that had some bacon in it as well.  Even though it wasn't as expected it still tasted quite good.    The bottom line for me is that I would head to Roost again in the future.  All of the food that I had here was pretty good and I enjoyed the ambience as well.",

I couldn't believe it, my assumption was it was going to be some boxed wine and a paper plate with some slices of American cheese, but hey I'm always up for something new! We arrived outside, we were greeted at the door and immediately I say \"we're here for all your wine and cheese!\" we go upstairs and are greeted by the friendly bartender who informs us his name is Bob.  Well Bob, we'd like two glasses of wine and two small cheese plates for your $10 happy hour special please! He remarks we are the first two customers EVER to order the special. Well look at that, we're trendsetters. I go ahead an humble brag on face book that this is the deal of the century and we are the first to check it out! The wine is decent (I went for the Cabernet) and the cheese plate comes out and I cannot believe my eye. It's an actual honest to god real put together cheese plate. Bob goes about explaining the cheeses. A brie with candied walnuts, an alpine swiss with a drizzle of local honey, a Wisconsin cheddar with a berry mostarda (cran? Ras?), and a fontina cheese with fresh berries (I may have gotten the exact descriptions wrong... i was drinking wine on an empty stomach), it also came with slices of crusty crispy bread. It was perfection! I look forward to going back some time in the near future to get some more wine and cheese!  the atmosphere was relaxed, it was impeccably clean, everything was very modern and crisp.  Bob was an absolute joy to have wait on us. He was nice, informative, he asked us questions and engaged us in conversation (since we were the only people upstairs for the first 45 min). He really did a great job describing everything to us and being completely helpful and totally funny!  I look forward to trying more of the menu next time, but I will definitely be hitting up the wine and cheese $10 happy hour special.  Deal of the century! If you're downtown, check it out!",

Server, Matt was a delight and came through with solid suggestions that we really enjoyed. Through no fault of his own, he was spread a bit thin in his section. Server assistant were attentive to table needs in the event Matt was busy.  Devin, the assistant General manager of operations(? Can't remember exact title) noticed the slip in service and jumped right in to make up for it(helping serve, not just apologizing). He went WAY above and FAR beyond to \"make it right.\"   Overall, food was excellent(get the crab cakes and chocolate burbon pecan pie), service was good, management seems to know what it's doing.",

The bacon-wrapped frog legs were lacking in flavor (how can that be, with bacon?).  The grains underneath were edible but forgettable.  The carrots, beans, and brussel sprouts salad topped with shrimp was fine, but again, totally forgettable.  Again, could have used more flavor.  The mushrooms, for instance, had no inkling of flavor.  The shrimp were cooked well but all in all, an unremarkable meal.   The portions were also small.  I was starving when I finished eating half a salad and half of the frog legs dish.  Considering that each dish was $18, totally not worth it.  I won't be returning.",

Revel is more of a loungey, casual happy hour feel that is a bit louder than the more fancy dining feel of Roost. The food is great, but the staff is even better. They definitely make you feel like you're being well taken care of. And for the Market Square area, this excellent service comes at a pretty low price comparatively.  Also, the second time I came here was for my mom's birthday, and they surprised us with a complimentary cheesecake that was insanely delicious. The manager even came over to wish my mom a happy birthday. Overall, it was a great experience!",

We had reservations for 4 on a Friday night downstairs, when we arrived there was a great live musician playing and it seemed like the happy hour crowd was trickling out.  Our waiter was great, he was very attentive (not too much) and helped us with the menu. Chris and I started our night with a bottle of Pinot noir while the other couple enjoyed some of their unique craft cocktails. For our meal, we decided to share off of the communal section of the menu. They had a wide variety to choose from and are perfect for sharing. Chris and I went with the short ribs, deviled eggs and banana peppers. All were delicious! The other couple shared the spicy tuna bites, lobster roll sliders, and garlic Parmesan French fries. They also enjoyed their choices! I loved the atmosphere in the bar area, I can't speak for the upstairs, but I'm sure it's similar. I think this is  great place to come with a group of friends or family and share off their small bite menu.",

    "text": "We went to Revel + Roost for #PittsburghRestaurantWeek - and we never could have recreated the meal at that awesome price! I already can't wait to go back to try brunch!  R+R is located right off Market Square. There is valet parking; however, there is a parking garage right next door, as well as one that is a two minute walk. Revel is on the first floor - and features an ala carte menu and an entire wall that opens to the outside.   We had a reservation for Roost, which is a an affordable upscale environment upstairs. The decor is gorgeous: wood floors, driftwood chandeliers, and all sorts of interesting knickknacks. Our reservation was right at the beginning of second seating - so we were fortunate enough to get a nice table by the window.   Two other random notes: 1) Since Revel is largely open to the outside, Roost got increasingly warm as we ate. It was almost uncomfortable. 2) The background music was fantastic. We really enjoyed the chill electronic vibe.  On to the food: #PRW was three courses...  -- For appetizers: My husband had California tuna, which was perfectly prepared rare/seared and disappeared off his plate fast; and, I had a summer riff on bruschetta that featured corn, heirloom tomatoes, cucumber, and avocado puree with basil crema.  -- In between appetizers and dinner, we were served a bread board, which included cheddar biscuits with pepper jam and toasted white bread with cinnamon butter. Delicious!  -- For our entrees: We both had surf & turf, because why wouldn't you order it when it's on a prix fixe menu?! The plate feature the most masterful medium rare petit filet I've ever tasted, butter poached lobster tail, mashed potatoes, and green beans. The meat was like butter (could have cut it with a spoon); the lobster tail was soft and fluffy; and, the sides helped to cut the richness of the proteins.  -- For dessert: My hubby had peach cobbler; and, I had a smores tart (graham crust, chocolate ganache, meringue points, house-made marshmallows - I could have eaten a whole bucket of the meringue!).  So why am I giving R+R four stars? The service was painfully slow. While our waiter was very friendly and checked in often, we had huge gaps between courses. I don't know if his timing was off or if the kitchen was backed up - but there seemed to be plenty of staff and empty tables around us to not warrant the wait. Our meal took two hours!  Let me reiterate, however, that the quality of the meal saved the day. My husband and I both agreed that every single bite of our meal was memorable and executed with an eye to presentation and taste. I believe that if R+R can improve on customer service, then they will join the ranks of Pittsburgh's 5-star restaurants!",

It was dinner time already but no one on the first floor was eating and we watched chefs from the kitchen just stare out and look bored which concerned me about the food.  But once seated upstairs the food was great.  I had the lamb rack which was tender and well dressed and we also had the petite filet which was great.  Overall the meat was excellent and the reason we would be back.   The reason for 4 stars and not 5 are some kinks I feel the restaurant is still working on.  First we were a party of 5 sat at a cocktail style high top table definitely made for 4. There were center pieces and lots of glassware making it impossible to put appetizers in the center. We ended up using the window ledge to hold some excess table settings. Also after ordering wine the manager came back with the correct bottle, started to open it then left.  He then returned with the wrong bottle and began to open that only for us to say the first was correct, it was just strange.   Our entrees came out very slow but our waitress Dani (think her name was) was polite and apologized and overall was great. Meat entrees were great, staff a little frazzled, small tables, and kitchen slow but still think I will be back for good food.",

    "text": "We went to the Revel section for lunch today.  I came in at 1 pm when the place was clearing out.  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over to me, which wasn't the best start.  My husband and I were wanting a quick lunch, so as soon as the waitress came over, I ordered our entire meal as I waited for my husband.  It did come out timely, but that - and the bacon - were the best parts of the meal.   We started with the twice baked fingerlings.  I don't know what we were expecting, but it wasn't this.  Out come 8 halves of potatoes - I guess they were fingerlings, but I would debate that.  They were hollowed out a bit and stuffed with cheese/butter mixture.  On top, was a tiny bit of scallions and bacon.  The bacon was delicious, but the rest of it had no flavor whatsoever.  I am not sure if there was cheese or butter in them - other than the description on the menu.  It needed salt desperately, but there was none on the table, so we had to track some down.  That helped, but they were still pretty sad.   Then I got the spinach salad with an add on of hangar steak, medium rare.  John got the shrimp gumbo.  The gumbo came in the smallest little container with a crostini.  The gumbo was very spicy and good, but for 9 dollars could have been a little bigger.  My salad consisted of huge pieces of spinach, a decent hunk of steak, some pickled onions, mushrooms, bacon and half a quail egg.  Half.  At first, I was impressed with the flavor of the salad - that was soon overshadowed by the ton of dirt/grit that was left on the spinach leaves and thus in my mouth.  I wanted to say something, but we had a short amount of time for lunch and I was starving.  And the waitress never really came back to fill our waters, so I wouldn't have expected much in the way of doing anything about the dirty spinach.    For 43 dollars for lunch, I expect a bit more.  Clean spinach, flavor, an actual whole quail egg if you are going to bother with the quail egg to begin with and a bit more attentive wait staff.",

Two of us got the Revel burger and were the only two to rave about our food, so based on my experience I have to give four stars. This burger is nothing shy of delicious. Conversations at dinner and with other friends suggest that the soup and salad are not worthwhile investments and you're best off with any kind of sandwich and potentially fries... one issue... all sandwiches come a la carte, and so that combination will end up quite expensive at least $4 more. My friend had the garlic Parmesan fries and the soft shell crab burger and seemed to enjoy both even with the price tag, but I for one thought $12-$16 on a burger was plenty. Service was slow at first but very attentive and friendly and drinks were tasty (Can Can and Daddy Warbucks are decent bang for your buck in content but will also cost you a pretty penny). If you're ready to eat a burger and fries at the price of steak then you shouldn't have issue here.",

I enjoyed the crab cakes Benedict that was made with real crab meat, however my husband ordered the hash and specifically asked for no peppers and it was full of peppers.  The restaurant wasn't busy when we went, so it should have been an easy request.  The weekly screwdriver was the highlight of the brunch with the bloody Mary being small in comparison to what is served elsewhere.  I would go back for lunch or dinner, but may skip brunch here for other excellent options in the city.",

    "text": "We went to the \"Roost\" part of the restaurant, which is the quieter and more classy part of the restaurant. It had some interesting decor upstairs. Although my husband found it to be too bright upstairs, I thought it was okay.  The service - we had a nice girl that checked up on us regularly to make sure things were ok. The other staffs were also friendly and very polite! The service was definitely up to par. The second my husband dropped his fork, they brought him a new one right away!  The food - this is the main reason why they got the review of 3 stars. We got a large Seafood Tower as appetizer, and the lobsters and uni are great! However the presentation is a little bit lacking (but at least it tasted good). There are a lot of raw clams, so make sure you are okay with that before you order. The drinks we got are decent, but again the presentation is slightly lacking with the price we paid for. As for the entree, I was definitely disappointed in the porter house I ordered. My medium rare turned into medium well, and the taste was more on the salty side. Maybe it is the quality of the meat, but it wasn't as tender as I thought it would be. My husband ordered Snapper, and that was better. The most exciting part of the meal was probably the bread! They give you three kinds of different bread and two different spreads. Overall - we won't be coming back soon. But if we do, we will just check out downstairs (Revel) for a few drinks and the party atmosphere.",

Anyway, we had a drink at the bar before dinner. Bartender Bob is very personable and efficient. I didn't find anything on their specialty list that appealed, so I had a really well made Cosmo.  Nice wine selection, but more 'by the glass' selections would be welcome.  Our friends knew the very personable waitress from previous visits to Revel.  2 of us split the cold seafood appetizer. When we couldn't identify the Uni that was supposed to be on the platter, our waitress apologized and brought some separately.  We all ordered various things. The soups (carrot ginger, seafood) are very special--don't hesitate on those. I got the butternut squash ravioli---awesome with the soft boiled egg. Cheese platter appetizer looked good and there were no complaints on the other entrees either, including the salmon and the chicken.  No room for dessert.  I'd love to stop again and try the Revel side.  Enjoy--these people know what they're doing!!",

I decided to order the Shrimp & Grits, which were very good.   It was a Friday evening, so Revel had a live musician, which we were able to hear upstairs and he was very good.

I went with the Revel & Roost burger which was a fancy blend of various meats, field greens, a marmalade sauce and we added cheese.  You have to pay extra for a side and we went with fries which you get your choose of salt/pepper, bbq or garlic parmesan. The garlic parmesan fries we so good and a hearty portion.

The crab tasted odd and unpleasantly dry. There was a burnt layer of...something...on top of the already bitter biscuits, which made each bite extra unpleasant. Not sure if that was intentional, but I was really not a fan of the burnt taste. I ended up just eating the egg on the other one. Although the menu items were exciting, the food disappointed.

If the restaurant can't handle large groups, they should not accept reservations of that size but I do not feel this is the issue. I think had we been a smaller group we would have had the same experience. Overall, disappointing and don't plan to go back!",

    "text": "Revel + Roost is more disappointing than DiCaprio at his first five Oscars. Way to completely let me down after all my high expectations. My boyfriend took me to Roost for dinner, the fancier upstairs section of the restaurant which is contrasted by the trendy bar atmosphere of Revel. The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was very, very loud. Perhaps we were just unlucky with timing, but the big parties around us were hollering at each other the entire time. Ear plugs recommended.  We were seated promptly, but our server was very slow to greet us and take our drink/food orders. Basically, she was just slow at everything.   The vegetarian appetizers left much to be desired, so we decided to go off the books and start with some add-ons: the Potato Gratin and Asparagus with Bearnaise. The asparagus was nothing mind-blowing but still enjoyable which is more than I can say for the potatoes. Someone went a little too crazy with the black pepper because the pungent taste was so overwhelming that I felt like I was choking. If you don't enjoy inhaling a pound of black pepper, I suggest staying away.  For my main course, I had the Pasta with Beans which I found out afterwards that it is actually NOT vegetarian. The waitress had told me prior to ordering that this was a vegetarian dish, so I trusted in her \"expertise\", however, the menu does mention there is pancetta if you look closely. Oblivious, hungry me started chowing down on the pasta as it came out. Only a third of the way in did I notice something wasn't right. After notifying the waitress, she still stood by the fact it was vegetarian until she checked the menu again. She replaced it with a fresh vegetarian version, but I barely received an apology or any reparation beyond that. The pasta dish itself was delicious but nothing mind-blowing. Average quality pasta dish with tomotoes and fava beans. I was just so mortified after being fed meat that it ruined the entire entree for me.   Hoping to forget about the pancetta debacle, we tried to end on a good note with some dessert. We selected the Chocolate Pudding & Banana Trifle which was definitely the star of the show. Highly recommend! It is chocolate pudding layered with fresh banana slices and topped with delicious chocolate brownie. Perfect size for sharing between two people. Prepare yourself for the chocolate coma afterwards.",

There were five of us this time.  We were greeted by one server, who started off really well.  He disappeared and was replaced by another.  he was also very friendly, but fell down a little on the check preparation (communal dishes should be able to be split without having to split the entire check evenly, IMHO).   There was a busser that came back literally 12 times asking for dishes, so we felt a bit rushed despite the fact that the place was empty.  Frankly, he seemed bored with nothing better to do but come back for one dish at a time.      Food.  Again, we were mostly disappointed by the portions.  The burgers were good sized and the communal mac and cheese was hands down the star of the evening.   One of our group asked for a medium rare burger with no tomatoes.  She was served a well done burger with tomatoes.   The single portions of appetizers were very small, as were the desserts.  Overall, we all felt a little underwhelmed.    Atmosphere.  The booth was far superior to the table I had previously and since the place was dead, the noise wasn't an issue this time  All in all, I have given it two valiant efforts, but I think there are better places downtown for the same price point.",

Went here for lunch on a Saturday, and it was not at all crowded--no one else when we arrived, two other tables an hour later. How do I know that there were only two tables an hour later? Because we were looking around, wondering what possibly could be causing our food not to be out an hour after ordering. Slowness was a theme.  When we did get our food, it was just barely warm. There were bites I had of the mac and cheese that were cold. I ordered mussels. The broth was flavorless, and the texture of the mussels was bad--some were too tough, some had the beards still on, and the last one I ate before stopping was a weirdly soft (almost liquid) texture. The toasted bread that came with it was burnt on one side and untouched on the other.  I tried a cocktail (Fire of 1825 or something like that), which was really quite nice. Nice blend of spicy and sweet, and the jalapeno vodka had a smokiness that you don't usually get. However, it took 15-20 minutes to get it when, again, the restaurant was empty. When we ordered a second round, the order didn't seem to register with the waitress and we had to put in the order again.  It took probably 20 minutes to get the waitress's attention to get the check after our plates had been cleared. Overall, it was about two and a half hours there for a bad lunch.",

The decor was very appealing. The menu had many different types of options: burgers, seafood, etc. I decided to order the brisket sandwich. 5 minutes after ordering I was told they didn't have brisket which seemed odd for a restaurant that just opened 2 days ago. I switched to the crab cake after hearing the recommendation from our waiter.  I will say that the crab cake was amazing. It was served over corn and mushrooms. At first it sounded like a weird combination but it was very good! The corn tasted like cream of corn. I also got a side of the garlic Parmesan fries. In comparison I think they were just average. Overall the only complaint about the food is the price. A lot of the appetizers were very pricey which is the whole reason we didn't opt to get one. In addition, there was no lunch pricing so I ended up paying $23 for lunch not including a tip.   Ambiance: 5 Food/Drink quality: 4 Presentation: 4 Price: 3 Overall: 4",

Today however, I went in for their brunch. The Maryland crabcake Eggs Benedict were wonderful. I also decided to do their Bloody Mary bar. I went up and got my first bloody Mary and made a mess.  I have an intentional tremor, and drinking coffee doesn't help it.    When Ben, once again my server, came up to see how things were going, I explained my situation. At that point he asked what I would like in my Bloody Mary and he went and made it for me and it was just like I like it.  Thank you again, Ben!",

    "text": "I picked this place on a whim when some of the more popular restaurants near Market Square were totally booked. I looked at the menu and thought it sounded really great, but was surprised there was so much availability at both restaurants on a Saturday night. This restaurant is actually 2 in 1, with a fine dining restaurant on the second floor, and a more casual dining experience on the ground floor, and both menus looked exceptional. We chose Roost (second floor) in hopes of getting a view of Market Square, but unless you are a two-top sitting right at the window closest to the square that isn't possible. That doesn't matter, though, because the atmosphere and decor are quite lovely and enjoyable. Our server, Bob, was very professional and pointed out all of his favorites on the menu. These did happen to be some of the more expensive options, but that's to be expected in a place like this. We asked how long they had been open and he told us only about three months, so that explained why they weren't booked solid on a Saturday. I think that will change before much time goes by. The food was all phenomenal. We got the cheese board, which had a nice selection of cheeses, the spinach salad, which was maybe the best spinach salad I've ever had, and the seafood gumbo, which was quite spicy but very good. My mom and I shared the Sea Bass, which was cooked perfectly. My friend had the Petit Filet and gave me a piece, which melted in my mouth. We had the au gratin potatoes and the asparagus for sides, which were also quite delicious. I would highly recommend this place and we will certainly be coming back.",

Pros: parking garage was right next to the restaurant.  $5 all day on the weekends is a plus. The atmosphere in Revel (downstairs) was great. Aluminum tiles on the ceiling, concrete flooring, lots of natural light, marble and wood along the walls, Tencel-like material for the drapes, plenty of seating, very comfy plastic chairs with plenty of room, and there was a projector playing The Three Stooges. Dominic was our waiter, and he was great. Very knowledgeable and helpful with all of our questions. J ordered the hanger steak with salt and pepper fries and a Dr. Pepper, and I had a white Zifindale with crab cakes, creamed corn, wild mushrooms, and tartar sauce. The food was banging! Everything was so delicious. Bonus: the chefs brought out our food after it was plated, which was great b/c our food was hot. For dessert, we both had the warm apple pie with cinnamon and brown sugar and bourbon ice cream. Hot damn was that delicious! Food coma inducing delicious!! All in all, everything was perfect. We will definitely be returning!",

A huge disappointment for our weekend trip, especially with so many other great options in the area that we passed up to try this awful place!",

The atmosphere is open and inviting and the staff is quick to please.  We both crafted our own Bloody Marys using their \"checklist\" where you customize everything from the mix to the add-ins and type of alcohol and the bartender makes your drink. This is such an upgrade from the other Bloody Mary bars around Pittsburgh where I have seen people touch everything and even eat off of their toothpicks before poking it back in to the condiments provided. The fact that you can make your own Bloody Mary but not have people licking the various options is enough to bring me back!  We had the oysters to start. They were good but not memorable. With that being said, my husband had the Crabcake Eggs Benedict.  It was very good - lots of jumbo crab meat and perfectly poached eggs. I had the Fried Quail and Waffles and it was amazing! The quail was fried perfectly and the waffles were tasty without being heavy. The spicy raspberry sauce was a great compliment and the portion size was appropriate. We will be looking forward to adding Revel to our brunch rotation!",

First time we arrived only to learn they closed the kitchen almost an hour and half early than the website said because \"it was slow\". Second time we went, excited to try a new place, we had to send back multiple drinks and dishes. Baked beans were not fully cooked, fried chicken was tasteless and burned, the cocktails were not consistent and also terrible, salad was bad, the \"communal\" lobster fritters were ok but with six small pieces for $14, I hate to see the size of the portion for a \"single\" order. To top it off the waitress dropped off one broken pen for the whole table to use when signing out checks. So we had to find our own pens to use. To their credit the management understood we were not happy and tried to fix what they could, but you can't hide bad food. One positive, the lazy Susan in the middle of our table was cool.",

First, the atmosphere is modern and trendy and would be great for a date or with a group of friends.  Then, our waiter was fantastic.  He was incredibly friendly, made excellent recommendations for every course, and was able to balance the fine line between being attentive and being intrusive very, very well.  The cocktail menu was a little small, and I like one or four cocktails with a good dinner, but on the bright side they are willing to create you your own cocktail if you tell the server what liquors and flavor combinations you like, so it's pretty impressive to be that accommodating.  We each had two of their bourbon-based cocktails, and they were strong but well balanced.  The one was essentially a boiler-maker with IC Light and a few other liquors...it drank like a beer but caught up to you like a shot...well worth the money.  The scallop and tomato tart appetizers were both really good (the bread plate they start you with was good, but there were only two little pieces of bread for like a disproportionately large ramekin of butter, so that was the one little oddity that I might critique).  The chicken and sea bass entrees were fantastic, and as per our waiter's recommendation, we split the blueberry pie with peach bourbon ice cream for dessert.  It was definitely shareable...very substantially sized dessert.  It was also delicious (and that's not the half a bottle of bourbon talking). Overall, I'd probably give it a 4.5 because I tend to be stingy with my 5 stars, but the incredible service warranted rounding it up.",

The cost was a great middle ground (not so high that it was hard for some of us to afford, but not so cheap that it felt like a pub). They split the checks for us. The selection was great for those among us who had food sensitivities and special diets (gluten free, vegetarian, etc). Our server, Matt, handled our large group professionally and juggled our many substitution requests. Food was creative and drink selection was interesting. Couldn't have asked for anything more.",

My coworker ordered a Cobb salad and their \"killer\" mac and cheese, and I ordered a soup and salad combo, that included the shrimp and lobster gumbo and kale and romaine salad. I would imagine these items would not take too long to prepare, but it took Revel about 40 min to bring our food out to us. Even with a not so full dining room.   I wasn't thrilled with the salad, but the gumbo was pretty good. I tried a few bites of the mac and cheese and I don't know if I would call it killer.

    "text": "Bad.  Stay away.   Sunday brunch at 1:30. Hostess didn't want to seat us in one of the many open tables as they were \"reserved\". So we offered to have a drink at the bar and wait for a table. Hindsight being 20/20, we should have left then.   This place is a cold mess. No one knows their roles. You have the bartender going MIA, a manager waiting, bussing and making drinks, a lost looking woman not helping at all, just trying to look busy by walking around, and one rookie server for the entire restaurant.   She ordered the unlimited Mimosas for $14.  I ordered the make your own Bloody Mary for $10. I asked the server what that meant and she told me it simply meant that I choose the vodka. So, Spicy Stoli Bloody was ordered. At the same time I ordered the crab cake sandwich with potato hash.  She ordered the breakfast burrito.  I asked the server how the potatoes were prepared as fries are another option. She left and returned to tell me they are cubed, served with green peppers and onions. So I went with it.    10 minutes later, no drinks. The above listed people were lost as we could see them all coming and going behind the bar without anyone actually doing any work.  The entire restaurant was at a full stop.   So I went to the bar to get the drinks. I sat unspoken to for another 5 minutes.  A bartender attempted to serve me an old Bloody Mary that was sitting at the end of the bar that had been made for another customer.  I asked if it was my spicy stoli and she said no. So after a quiz, she started a fresh one for me. What I got was tomato juice, some hot sauce and Stoli.  I asked, \"that's it?\"  She says, \"well it's a make your own and you ordered Stoli with hot sauce and that's what I made.\"  I say, so you're not going to make a Bloody Mary, no celery, olive, lime, or any other elements?  She says, you didn't order that.  I say, \" I ordered a Bloody Mary with Stoli, and I assumed you as a bartender know how to make that.  I shouldn't have to ask the server to write down directions and the recipe for you.\" She reluctantly put an olive and lime in the glass.  Then she poured her Mimosa.    While this back and forth was taking place, my sandwich was delivered. I witness our server grab that same old Tomato Juice with vodka that was previously attempted to be passed on to me and take it to our table. WTH?  I go back to table with our drinks. No breakfast burrito. But potato hash is there. Potatoes, one 1/2 inch skinny slice of a green pepper and 5 very small cuts of an onion.  The kitchen had given up.   15 minutes later after multiple conversations with the clueless staff, a burrito is delivered.  Ice cold sausage.  No avocado as advertised.    She sent it away to the manager she flagged down. He did offer to remove it from the bill.  Now, another 10-15 minutes waiting for the check that was requested to multiple staff.    Finally I go to the bar and ask for it.   Here's where you have to pay attention.  Revel + Roost upcharges you on your check from the menu prices. The $14 mimosa was now $16.  The $10 bloody is now $10.85.   Taxes added later on the bill.  I circled and noted the up charges on the check and gave her my card.  No adjustment made for me.  They simply get away with overcharging customers for bad food, very poor service and an hour plus experience from hell.    It's very clear that the kitchen staff has given up, the staff is clueless and and the entire place is poorly managed.  Your hard earned money is best spent elsewhere.   The owner seriously needs to watch the video from the security cameras, if there are any.  It would be a wake up call.  You, the owner, are being robbed of your money and reputation by an inept staff.   Don't go there.  The most recent reviews are all 1 Star reviews. Stay away.",

First of all, it looked like it was closed. There was one small group of older ladies there. They left a few minutes after us and then it was just me and my boyfriend...  I saw a picture of a bloody mary on the front sign and decided upon walking in that thats what I wanted. It looked nothing like the picture though, which was disappointing. It was small and only garnished with a lemon, lime and olive.  Upon initially ordering, I wanted the chicken panini but was told it wasnt ready? What? It was about 2 o clock in the afternoon I was there soooo not a good sign...I ended up with the fried quail and waffles. It sounded interesting so I went for it. The quail was pretty good, lightly battered and fried. The waffle tasted fresh and homemade. It came with a side of spicy syrup which was good. What I didn't like; the entree was topped with what tasted like pickled green beans (which tasted like garbage) and a random pickled carrot which after tasting the green bean I didn't even bother tasting. The carrot and green beans were so out of place, they brought the entire dish down.   I had some of my boyfriends salmon burger and fries which were pretty good. Chances are though, I will not be returning.",

I was really surprised that this place wasn't packed. I loved their drinks and the food. I would suggest Roost for any happy hour. It is easy to get to downtown and super spacious. The service, was amazing!I loved it.   Appetizers: Artisan Cheese Plate: YUUMMM. But really how can you go wrong with a cheese plate? I would hope that anyone that goes out with me would want to order any thing with cheese plate in the appetizer name. It had about four different types of cheese and some nice jam and fruit. It mixed well. Yum!  Entrees: Ora King Salmon: mashed potatoes, haricot vert, wild mushrooms, blackberry beurre blanc. I ordered this first when I got in and it was awesome. The wild mushrooms were delicious. I liked the blackberry beurre blanc, I was weirded out by this at first, but in the end it was great. A really amazing thing. Also those mashed tatoes, yuuuummmm.  Salmon Sandwich: brioche bun, lettuce, tomato, house-made tartar. I was accidentally got this at first instead of the Ora King Salmon. I was happy that they let me keep this instead of throwing it out. I liked it. The brioche bun was a real treat. I would say that for a lunch treat this would be great. I just wanted the dinner portion because I am a hog.   REVEL: I went to Revel for Valentine's day with my girlfriend. THEY HAD A FREE PHOTOBOOTH. Basically, because of this, I will always love them. The service was really nice and they had a great VDay menu. I did not order anything on it, but it looked really good.  Appetizers: Scallop + Potato Gnocchi: Tomato + red pepper jam, crispy pork belly with preserved lemon caramel, squid ink braised calamari + octopus, arugula, grapefruit supreme. DANG. This was the weirdest thing I ever tried and it was totally worth it. I loved it. I thought that that squid ink was a little salty but other than that I would get this again for sure. YUMM. Super weird with a lot of flavors mixing in your mouth. Totally worth it! TRY IT OUT.  Salad: Carrots, Beans + Brussel Sprouts: spicy tahini-yogurt, grapes, pine nuts, winter greens, date jam, pickled beech mushroom and eggplant, garlic-parmesan crouton. OK. Now that I am looking at this with all the ingredients I just realized that we were missing a few in our salad. Our salad was missing the mushrooms and eggplants, grapes, winter greens, and the garlic-parm crouton. We just got beans, brussel sprouts and the carrots. That is weird....right? I didn't like the salad that much, but maybe it was because it was missing most of the ingredients.   Soup: Curried Cauliflower Soup: brown butter cauliflower, earl grey raisins, coconut milk, baby cilantro, crostini. This was ok. I wasn't over the moon about it. It tasted like it needed something else. Maybe cayenne? Some spice? I don't know. Something extra was needed. It was ok but not stellar.   Extras: Brussel Sprouts with Bacon: Just order two and be done with it. So good. So good. So good. Trust me. It was worth it.  Wine: House Cab: $5 during happy hour. Totally worth it.  I like this place a lot. I think that both of the restaurants are stellar. I would suggest both of these places for a nice happy hour or a nice dinner.",

The vibe in here is really calm, but trendy. The food is good, but not great. I did, however, love the crispy cauliflower. The aioli on the side is perfect, too.   I definitely would rate the atmosphere and location higher than the quality of food at Revel, but if you're going out for a dining experience with the ability to enjoy good company in GOOD LIGHTING (I find so many places in Pittsburgh that have you eating in the dark!), this place is worth checking out.   The cocktails are great, too. Lots of flavor and they're priced decently compared to other bars in the area!",

    "text": "When I got downtown it was so frigid cold I had to duck in here just to get warm. I was the first to arrive so i was seated immediately. My waiter was very friendly and helpful. I learned from him that Revel and Roost are two separate restaurants. Roost which is located upstairs was serving breakfast brunch and was told it was more upscale dining.  Down here in Revel I looked over their lunch menu and saw that everything was ala carte. At my waiter's suggestion I ordered the breaded fish sandwich and for $6.00 extra (my goof on the tip I posted) I could have a side of brussel sprouts with bacon. I have had this side at a different restaurant and really enjoyed it so was anxious to try it here.  I got my sandwich which came with lettuce, tomato, and tartar sauce. It wasn't overly big but it was a bit messy. However, it was delicious.  The brussel sprouts and bacon were literally to die for!  It was so good that if you were choosing any side I'd recommend this one.  My waiter even packed me an extra of my ice tea to take with me. I was pleased with my meal. It would be nice if they included some basics with the sandwiches rather than everything ala carte but it is what it is. They do have a full bar but didn't have time for that. It is located on Forbes Ave as you approach Market Square across from the Dollar Bank.",

    "text": "I came here - well, to Revel specifically - earlier this week for dinner with a family member, and we were very happy with our meal here. The ambience was great, the decor chic, and the photo displays of old Pittsburg (nope, that's not a typo!) were something that any good Pittsburgher will appreciate. The service was also exceptionally prompt - our water glasses were never empty, and we were asked about the state of our cocktails more times than I can count.   Food-wise, my dining buddy ordered the salmon sandwich - she got a massive square of fresh salmon presented on a big bun. It was one of the freshest and tastiest fish sandwiches I've had in a while, and was immediately a winner in our books. I on the other hand ordered their shrimp and lobster gumbo, as well as a spinach salad that came with bacon lardon, pickled shallot, mushrooms, deviled quail egg, and bacon vinaigrette. I added chicken atop that glorious salad for good measure, and every bite that I ate equaled a mouthful of \"yum\". The gumbo had the perfect amount of kick to go along with its flavor, and while the chicken was slightly well done around the edges it was still tender and tasted great atop that ensemble of salad toppings. Any place that can add its own spin to a plain old spinach salad gets mad props from me, and Revel + Roost certainly succeeded in doing so.   For good measure, the great cocktails meant that both of us were able to drink our dessert during dinner - I ordered a Jacks, because 'tis the weather for fireball whiskey. And it was goooooood, assuming you like fireball of course. My dining buddy's Maple Fashioned was admittedly not the tastiest version of the beverage I've ever had, but it was respectable nonetheless.  Great food, fantastic service and a lovely looking restaurant make for a killer dining spot. It gets a bit loud here, so that's the only thing I would caution against if that's not something you go for at dinner. We'll see if I make it to Roost in the future, but the chances are good that I'll at least dine at Revel again!",

My husband and I arrived at 10:30am to a nearly empty dining room and got seated by the windows: A perfect spot for people watching.   We were given a bread basket full of muffins, scones, and spreads to start things off. This was such a pleasant and tasty surprise. I like surprises but I probably wouldn't have ordered a side of buttermilk biscuits ($3) had I'd known this basket of goodies was provided. But oh well, you can never have too many breakfast carbs.   I got the deep fried eggs ($6), my husband got bagel n' lox ($15), and we shared the lamb hash ($9). The yolks in my deep fried eggs were perfectly cooked and the brown butter hollandaise was very good. I wished the fried part was a bit crunchier. I think the hollandaise soaked in, making the coating soggy.   The lamb hash was topped with house-made lamb bacon, smoked romesco sauce, and quail egg. It was extremely delicious packing tons of flavor and texture. I could definitely eat this over and over.   Service was attentive and the overall atmosphere was nice. I'll look forward to coming back to try the dinner menu.",

We ate on the second floor and this Is the review for the restaurant, not the bar. The atmosphere was pleasant, not very loud for our Saturday night reservation. Our table of 6 all ordered drinks. Most of us tried the \"Fire of 18??\" Reading the ingredients you would have thought it was going to be hot, but more of a slight kick than any real heat. I switched to martini afterwards and sorry to say I have had better. We ordered a couple appetizers to start. The Short ribs were very spicy, which the menu did not mention anything that would make it so hot. The scallops and gnocchi were just alright. The scallops were cooked well and very tasty, but the rest of the dish was ehh. Again there was a heat to the sauce which the menu failed to mention. Cold calamari & octopus and the gnocchi was just barley warm. Not a dish I would recommend, plus the squid ink in the dish was not necessary at all. We also had the frogs leg wrapped in bacon. I'm not a huge fan of frogs legs to begin with, so I won't give my opinion. One of our guest did say the legs were much smaller than what they are used to having. Next was the lobster and shrimp gumbo, personally the best part of the meal for me. Although for $6 they should give you more than what they serve you. Looks like it's about 1/4 - less than 1/2 cup. A shame to as it was very good. For the main course 2 had steaks which looked good and cooked well. One had the fish which looked good. Two of us had the Osso Bucco... what a disappointment this was. First we were told by the waitress that they are well known for the pork dishes. So trusting the word of the waitress we tried it. Now if you aren't sure what Osso Bucco is normally it's slow cooked veal shank, this place does it with a pork shank. Came out looking char black, we think from some type of sauce but not really sure. We ate what we could, was way over cooked, just looking at the Char that was on the bone itself any decent chef could see how over cooked it became. Very very dry, did not get the chance to make comment as waitress never came back once we bit into it. Really disappointed considering that this is what there known for as per our waitress. I wound up getting very sick at the end of the night and I'm not saying this restaurant made me sick, but all I could taste was the Osso Bucco trying to work its way up, so you be the judge. We discussed this on the way home, and think the chef should pay attention to the rule of \"less is more\". He seems to be trying way to hard to put too many different flavors together at one time. Personally I don't think it works, but you be the judge. FYI might want to keep garbage can next to bed at end of night just in case.",

    "text": "Nice looking--Not very busy--but noticed 2 bartenders and only one waitress!? Various people brought us things--even the bus boy brought out food--the bartender brought out our app--service was slow--very slow--and our waitress took one order at a time--we were sat by hostess and waitress came by to give us water and did not take an order--said she would be back for our drinks...waited awhile, she came back and took our drink order then left...upon bringing our drinks then asked if we wanted to start with anything--took that order then came back for our dinner order--we were ready to order when she took app order...then waited for our soup--then one item was done wrong, had to send it back and out came something completely different--order the Revel Burger with no dressing, but it had dressing on it--it comes with bacon and no bacon on it--so asked for the bacon and no mayo/mustard dressing again, and out came just a bacon burger--then they charged me $2.00 for bacon??   This burger was for a teenager--so he had to wait for a new burger--should have been comped because the waitress admitted she told them no bacon.  I said we just requested no dressing...all the rest was fine--so her mistake--then she rings up add bacon?! So food was okay--Cheese tray is lovely--great presentation--but food was ok--not great. Service was slow--took forever to get our waitress flagged down to correct the burger...noticed a large group of 7 come in and sit next to us and they too waited long time for their drinks. So--understaffed in front of house-- But--to boot--Valet service wrecked the car!  Not a ding or dent--a sideswipe on garage wall!!  Saw valet come into restaurant 2 times--thought he was getting a water--not sure if valet associated with restaurants or--a service on Forbes Ave/Market Square--or if valet has an agreement with restaurant that they can come in and out of the place--but--bet that is when he hit my car--but conveniently parked on street when we exited restaurant--damage side facing away!  So be careful--garage parking right there--I suggest you park yourself!",

    "text": "2.5 stars. My husband and I stopped in for breakfast on a quiet Tuesday morning while traveling back home after the holidays. The decor is very trendy/hip. I can tell that Revel is probably a popular after-work drinks and dinner spot. Roost serves breakfast upstairs and has equally cool decor, lots of natural light and windows overlooking the street below. Our server was very attentive and gave special attention to our almost 2 year old son, but beyond the service and atmosphere, the quality of the food was sub-par. My husband said the coffee was watery and overall our food was very bland. My over-easy eggs had no flavor and were over-cooked. My waffle tasted old like it was a few days old and warmed up, not made-to-order. The hash browns were good (peppery) and bacon was good. However, my husband's Egg Benedict had a ham that more resembled spam and his toast came out cold without any butter or jelly/jam. I would give this place another chance for a cocktail but I won't ever order food here again.",

I first dined upstairs, which I may add the atmosphere was perfect. The decor is great and allowed for a relaxed dining experience. I ordered the Butternut Squash Dumplings, which is something I usually would not order because the poached egg threw me off a bit, but I am so glad I tried it. It was amazing and I have been craving it since I went. Our server was also great especially with recommendations on which appetizers to try out. After dinner we headed downstairs to the bar area where we continued the night. All around, a great place to start and end your night, I would highly recommend trying out Revel + Roost!",

We then were seated in the bar  area of the Roost where we had a wonderful conversation with Bob the bartender and as our sever ! He was very knowledgeable .. As for dinner .. The Murray's Chicken and Petit Filet were amazing ! The filet ranked within the top 3 of best steaks which  by my husband ! Yes he ranks them !! Very tender .. But .. All in all..

I ordered the breakfast burrito with braised beef and my wife ordered a blueberry waffle and eggs for her and my daughter... waffle was fine. Nothing special but no issues... the burrito's eggs were fine..again nothing special but the braised beef seemed to taste like leftover that they quickly threw on a skillet... very tough and areas impossible to even pull apart with hands... we also ordered blueberry fritters for a side... you guessed it, came out completely uncooked in the middle.. straight runny dough!  The manager sat at the bar drinking a Starbucks coffee (should have been a sign not to order their coffee) and never once came over to check on us even though we were only one of 2 tables when we came in and 3 when we left... we naturally sent the fritters back and they took that and the cappuccino off the check but felt more should have been done...  But wait, in the words of the late Billy Mays, THERES MORE!   As I had to get up to use the bathroom prior to leaving I had to walk passed the kitchen.  Smelt of sewage and dirty dog kennel... I thought it had to come from bathroom but was pleased, yet terrified to open the bathroom door to a clean and nice smelling room... terrified as to know the smell wasn't coming from the bathroom. I had my wife check the women's room to confirm... yep, that one was clean and smelled nice too. So the kitchen was the culprit and we were both appalled and left with a sick feeling in our stomach...  Yeahhhhh I don't think we will be back...  would have discussed with manager if he even pretended to give a damn...",

The restaurant has a good layout with a large bar area for happy hour with a smaller dining room with large windows that were open to the fresh air. Happy prices on house wine and draft beer were good ($5 each), though the beer selection was weak.  Our table ordered 3 burgers and the PLT. My bacon cheeseburger was supposed to be medium and it was served well-done. My mother-in-law wanted her burger well-done and got medium. I didn't notice the switch until after a few bites because my toppings were correct. She got my toppings too though, so I don't know wtf happened. I had difficulty tasting the bacon lardon even though there was plenty topped on the burger. The french fries (for $1 upcharge) were unremarkable. My fiancee said her PLT (a prosciutto BLT on focaccia) was tasty but not worth the price. Our service was average. The place seems like a solid happy hour spot, but there are much better options for dinner in Market Square.",

I ordered a crabcake sandwich with a side of slaw for 4.00 extra. The crabcake was good but the slaw was a fail. I remarked to my girlfriend I was with that it was swimming in mayo to which she retorted more accurately \"no, it was drowning in it\"! True, that. Price for sandwich, slaw, and iced tea was about 21.00.  If the slaw had been unique and excellent I probably would not have minded so much but separately priced and not well executed? Hmm.  3 stars for average.",

The Dark Knight cocktail was good, according to my friend. The Vernicular was surprisingly kinda sweet for an old fashioned, I guess because of the vanilla flavoring.

Below is the result -    $10 up charge for a salmon filet atop a salad seems a BIT much. If the salad didn't offer meat to begin with I could maybe better understand the cost. The waiter didn't at all indicate that an up-charge may occur, I fully expected a few dollars, but not $10 additional! Not impressed at all!!!! Maybe explains the empty dining room.",

I enjoy some things about this place - great location near Market Square, big open layout, nice selection of beers and cocktails. But things kinda fall apart when it comes to the food.   It's not bad, per se.... just uninspired, boring, bland, and inconsistent. When I came during lunch, the fries were burnt. A colleague and I both ordered the Chicken BLTA wraps - hers had comically huge chunks of avocado while mine had two tiny slivers. My wrap was also loaded up with lettuce and skimpy on the chicken, especially for the price.   I probably would not come back here for the food... there are plenty of better restaurants downtown nowadays. But I would come back here for drinks or happy hour.",

I highly recommend the brick oven pizza or the tempura shrimp tacos if your looking for something light on your stomach and wallet. The Lemeiux Carre cocktail had a perfect balance of sweet and sour and there were a handful or so of drafts in special.  Revel has yet to disappoint.

    "text": "This place is a solid 2.5-3 stars in my book. It's nothing great but I had a decent experience. I wanted to give it a try so my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for appetizers and drinks before a show. I made a reservation on open table. I arrived early and was sat right away. I asked if we could sit at a table by the open window and the hostess said absolutely so we were already off to a good start! Happy hour is 4-7 here which I love because at most places when it starts at 4 it ends at 6 but not here so we took advantage of the $5 house wines (Woodbridge). They had live music playing which was great! Not sure who the guy was but I'd go back just for that! He was playing all the best 90's hits and sounded amazing! The inside is nice and modern with two huge TVs on the wall. The downstairs Revel where I dined is casual fare and Roost the upstairs is more upscale with dinner options on the menu. The service we received was pretty good. Our waiter was attentive and the wait staff did seem to help each other out by clearing plates and getting refills for all the table around us.   I didn't want a big meal so I was in the mood to get small plates and share and this was the right place to do that. The menu offers a variety of communal dishes (great for sharing), soups, salads, pizza, and burgers. I was surprised by the crab cakes! They were actually pretty good and the best thing we ordered. I also liked the chicken sliders. They were fried and crispy but lacking some flavor, not bad but need kicked up a notch. The tuna appetizer was not what I was expecting and I wasn't impressed again not bad but nothing special. The wedge salad was huge and had the right amount of dressing however for such a big salad they need to add more bacon and blue cheese crumbles. It was way too big of a salad with not enough toppings.   I'm not dying to come back for the food but I liked the atmosphere so I will be sure to stop in for a drink sometime. I also would like to try Roost!",

    "text": "Walked into Revel because it was the restaurant next to my hotel. I didn't expect much, but as a single woman traveler, I didn't want to travel far for a bite and a drink.   What I got really exceeded my expectations. Interesting bar food, attentive but not obtrusive service, and excellent drinks. Revel is several cuts above your average hotel restaurant!  First, let me honor the waitstaff and bartenders, because they were excellent!  DJ explained the menu and was very attentive without getting in the way of my meal, which can be a fine line. He and the bartending staff (who mix a fine perfect Manhatten) had a nice rhythm going with drinks and the kitchen, so delivery to my table just flowed!  I wasn't in the mood for a large dinner, and I'd had a burger for lunch, so I ordered small plates:  fried cauliflower, crab cakes, and pork bao. The cauliflower and crab cakes were excellent! I would have liked a few more hot peppers to offset the grease of the fried cauliflower, but that is personal preference. The bao were also very tasty, but the pork belly was a little fatty for my taste. If the bao had included the advertised special Carolina pulled pork instead of pork belly, plus everything else in the dish, it would have been my absolute favorite plate.  The restaurant also offers pizzas, soups, salads, and a few entrees.  In short, Revel is an upscale bar with interesting food and attentive service, including being nice to women traveling solo. I'd recommend the restaurant for a upscale bar food and good drinks.",

We had the fingerling potatoes, cheese curds, and quail and waffles.  Everything was so tasty and arrived quickly which was surprising because it was so busy.  I love unique and different combinations and these were really unique.  Server was very friendly and knowledgable.  Only downside is they got my drink wrong but they fixed it right away.    Then we went upstairs to Roost and that was even better.  I had the crab cake which I'm very picky about and it was out of this world good.  The cream corn was the perfect combination.  We also had the pork dish (amazing), butternut squash dumplings and salmon.  Food was so good.  Our server was great upstairs as well.  Decor is gorg!!  I can't wait until the summer when they open up the big windows downstairs at the bar. It's going to be such a great spot.  All in all, super nice addition to Market Square and really cool vibe.  Unique dishes that are unfussy and down to earth but upscale combinations. Loved it!! Going back this weekend.",

    "text": "NEVER AGAIN. BAD POLICIES DESERVE ONE STAR: I have been to Revel a couple of times and Roost once, and my experiences were generally positive, but my most recent experience was pathetic to say the least, and prompted me to edit my review and reduce it to one star. I entered Revel on a Saturday night, after a Penguins home game and on the eve of a Steelers home game -- downtown was hopping and Revel was pretty busy, though there were a handful of empty tables, especially inn the front in what I'd term the \"restaurant section.\" It was 10:03 p.m. and I asked the hostess if the kitchen was still open and she promptly replied that it was. She then busted her butt to quickly wipe down and re-set a table for our party of three. After all of her work as we were about to head to the table, she apologetically informed me that the kitchen had closed. I inquired if the restaurant had a set closing time and she said that it didn't. After leaving and going to nearby (and very accommodating) Sienna on the Square, where the three of us quickly dropped $50 each on a late dinner, I looked up the hours posted on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frevelandroost.com&s=13efb4259f593a1872e9ed5d9ddca26926471cc554f05fac66d6e5de7903f220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">revelandroost.com</a> only to discover that there were indeed set closing hours, which happened to be midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. As if the kitchen of a bustling casual restaurant suddenly deciding to close two hours early on a Friday night wasn't bad enough the hostess outright lying is a reason that I'll never set foot in the place or recommend it to anyone again.   For what they're worth at this point, myy original reviews for these dual restaurants appear below Don't be discouraged that this is part of a Hilton Garden Inn, as it's well-thought out, attracts locals and is not a typical hotel restaurant. It's two in one, with Roost, the more upscale restaurant on the second level, with Roost on the street level. It's odd to review them together, but there's only one Yelp entry for the two of them, so here goes... REVEL: There are a number of interesting cocktails. I was pleasantly surprised by the Ryse+Shine (Bulleit Rye, Milagro Respado honey simple syrup, Fernet, lemon juice, ginger beer), which was refreshing and tasty with none of those ingredients being overpowering. The chilled melon soup with with minted compressed melon, currin scented cream and micro mint, may be the best chilled soup that I've ever had (and I order them frequently). The braised beef sandwich with slow-cooked braised roast beef, taleggio cheese fonduta, pickled shallot and arugula on a toasted baguette was very good, but not as interesting as the ingredients lead on. The spicy roasted  cauliflower was interesting though. The bartender was able to answer all questions and provide great advice for both food and drinks, and she was polite, gracious and kind as well. The large handsome room has an open feel and a lively vibe, even when it's not full. Two large screens in the dining area are playing silent movies, though those at the bar can watch conventional silent televisions. My only very minor quip is that they don't have soup spoons, though their regular spoons were better with soup than your typical table spoon. ROOST: Also has interesting cocktails, though if I'm not mistaken, they're a bit different than Revel's. The menu is definitely taken up a notch from Revel's, but it shares the same creativity. Roost's options are all full entrees in contrast with Revel's diverse offerings that include sandwiches. I ate at the bar and the service from the bartender was top notch. Dessert was also good.",

I just had a great vibe and you can tell by the range of hip people coming here. From young business adults to older 60's and up can also blend in well.   I went on a Thursday after work for drinks and dinner. We got there around 5 and was easily able to get a table. Plus they are on open table so it's easy to get a table.   We sat down stairs which has a different menu with smaller bites and less expensive prices.   I started with the soup. It was awesome. I had the jambalaya and it had great flavors.   Service was good too. The entire staff constantly checked on things for us. It was certainly a team working together to serve the clients. Finally a place that gets service!   I got the shrimp n grits. At first it looked great. The shrimp had a nice grilled char but we're in the smaller side. I had three mid size shrimp. It was also paired with two pieces of pork belly which was over cooked.   Now the grits were just disappointing. I love grits and make them all the time. It tasted like pure cheese. It was almost too much that I could not eat them alone. With the bites of protein they balanced out nicely. But just too much cheese.   Overall a good experience and I look forward to trying other items on the menu. Might even go for upstairs menu on date night with the wife.",

That may work for some but it was too strong for my wife to drink. After a few sips we asked her for another splash of sprite and a few ice cubes but it did not help much. We ended up leaving the drink and our $12 behind. All good, you live and learn. I usually play it safe and did so again this time with a beer. I was ecstatic to see they had Firehouse Red beer. It is not the best but I do enjoy it-lets just say it holds a special place in my heart. We did not order food but based on the pics from my fellow Yelpers it was probably a wise decision. The food just did not appeal to me. I doubt we would return, so many other places I prefer in this area (Hello McCormick and Schmick's, Primanti's, Las Velas).",

When we finally got our food my whole 3 small diced potatoes that didn't even equal a full potato came with my entree was undercooked and hard. I had the chicken which was tiny and left me still hungry, the sauteed greens were extremely salty as well. The waitress brought us dessert to-go \"for the long wait\" but when we opened it up it was another tiny dessert that two people definitely could not share which felt like a slap in the face. I don't mind paying $100 for dinner but I expect it to be fully cooked, edible and filing. The restaurant was completely dead which was why I was very upset that it took so long to get our food. Especially since we ordered two apps. since it was dead, there should have been no reason to take that long to cook food which was ultimately undercooked. I did not complain to the manager because my girlfriend talked me out of it. EDIT: After multiple attempts to reach the GM as directed I had no luck. I have tried since I got the comment back on yelp. Unfortunate.",

    "text": "My dining companion and I stopped by Revel + Roost after biking through the city, as he knew someone who worked there. The atmosphere was very elegant, but we were not made to feel out of place, despite our slightly sweaty condition. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly.  We shared two appetizers--Barbecue Short Ribs and Chilled Melon Soup--and I ordered the Apple Smoked Chicken Panini while my companion ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger.  The Barbecue Short Ribs were absolutely perfect! The sauce was just sweet enough, enhanced by the bread and butter pickle garnish, but not lacking in that smoky flavor you get in good barbecue. The pieces of boneless meat fell apart to the slight touch of the fork and simply disintegrated into juicy morsels in your mouth. I don't order short ribs, well, ever, but this was heaven in appetizer form.  The Chilled Melon Soup was also a delightful surprise. If you are not familiar with such a dish, it has the texture almost of a thin applesauce, and the cooling effect was much appreciated on the hot, summer day. The flavors were further intensified with a slight hint of mint and cumin-flavored cream, providing a contrasting mouthfeel with the somewhat granular consistency of the soup.  My Apple Smoked Chicken Panini was not exactly was I expected--I was thinking of a boring chicken breast with stuff on it--but it was more like a diced chicken salad with a piquant cheese instead of mayonnaise, and crisp apple slices completed a full sensory experience. The bread was toasted to perfection as well: not too crisp, not too soft.  I am sorry to say that I missed the opportunity to taste the bacon cheeseburger freshly prepared: I ate the remaining half of it the next day. I had to remove the tomato--I hate raw tomatoes--and unfortunately the tomatoey-ness had of course seeped into the bun. Burgers don't hold up well the next day, so unfortunately it seemed a bit dry, and I did not have any condiments to add to it. The beef patty was well-marbled, and I could tell that it would have been very juicy right out of the kitchen. I love me some ultra-processed American cheese most days, but the creaminess of smoked, sharp aged cheddar perfectly complimented the sweet and salty thick-cut bacon was thick-cut. I hate when the bacon is wimpy or thin-sliced, but you could actually feel the bacon with your teeth as you take a bite of of the burger!  Because my dining companion knew someone who worked there, we got a brief unofficial tour of the space. The downstairs \"Revel\" part is more casual dining, where the upstairs \"Roost\" is a fine dining experience. There are also private dining rooms, so the can probably host events, and the upstairs seems to have a full kitchen as well. I don't drive, so I wasn't paying close attention, but I believe Revel + Roost has a dedicated parking garage, or maybe it shared one with the attached Hilton? Either way, that sounded like bonus points to me.  I immediately recommended Revel + Roost to my friend the next day, and I know that he is very picky about his eating establishments. I certainly plan to return again soon.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this new place but unfortunately the reviews are overrated.  I was in the \"Revel\" section downstairs so maybe \"Roost\" is better (and should probably have a separate Yelp page since it's a different restaurant).  When I arrived the hostess didn't explain the restaurant concept so we just sat downstairs and it wasn't until after being seated that I realized the upstairs was a different restaurant with a different menu, but we were looking for something more casual anyway so that was fine.  We had planned to go for happy hour knowing there were drink specials, but the specials were only a dollar off drafts or wells or a couple of house wines were discounted, but none of their special cocktails were on discount and most of the wines were full price.  For the food we shared the lobster fritters which were tasty but way over priced for $14 as they were essentially just hush puppies with tiny bits of not fresh lobster and mostly breading. For my meal I ordered the half bucket of chicken plus the fingerling potatoes (technically an app but I ordered as a side).  The fingerling potatoes consisted of just 4 tiny red potatoes (see photo) just sliced in half with a tiny bit of cheese scallions and bacon but they were flavorless and required salt, which I had to ask for. The \"bucket of chicken\" was not actually served in a bucket but on a plate (see photo).  When the waiter brought it I was confused and was like \"that's the bucket of chicken\" and he said \"yep.\"  Why would they call it that if it's just served on a plate? I was expecting a more fun presentation.  The chicken was flavorless and not at all crispy (some of the battery was mushy and just kind of slid off) and a little bit too cold in the center (though fully cooked--I suspect it was sitting out for awhile).    The chicken was supposed to come with a spicy raspberry sauce which it didn't.  I asked for it and they brought me a side of it which was tasty but not spicy at all, which was part of why I had ordered the dish. The pickled veggies that surrounded the chicken didn't really make a nice side for this as they were way too tart or sour and overpowered the very bland chicken.  I was surprised for the price that it didn't come with any kind of starch on the side.My friend ordered the \"Chicago style pizza\" which was most certainly not Chicago style by any definition of the word (see photo).  For example, the crust wasn't right at all and the cheese was on top instead of the middle, and it was thick but not deep dish.  They shouldn't call it Chicago style if they aren't going to make it Chicago style.  On the positive side, the cocktails were all pretty good, the server was very attentive, and the ambiance was a nice modern design and very comfortable, with plenty of space between the tables and old movies being projected on the wall next to the bar.",

The venue was well thought out and elegant.  Appetizer: scallops were pricey but very good! There were only 3 with the order, but it also included pork belly which was a nice pairing.   Bread: I didn't know that with ordering your entree comes 2 types of bread with dipping sauces (for lack of a better word). It was a cinnamon butter and a Thai chili dipping sauce with 2 types of bread.  I have also been here again, maybe 1 month later for a large dinner birthday party with girlfriends during restaurant week.  The experience was EVEN better!  I'm so pleased with the quality of service from servers, bartenders, cooks, and management. They worked with us in a relatively short amount of time.  I would mention the food I had, but it was a special menu during restaurant week so it probably wouldn't do anyone any good.    This venue is soooo BIG it can pretty much accommodate anything (party, corporate meeting, corporate dinner, etc).",

Reasonable price  All bases covered in a trendy, yet comfortable atmosphere makes this a nice stop to get the first meal of the day.  Given that it won't break the bank, either gives that added bonus for a meal away from home.

The breakfast was held in the upper level of the restaurant and appeared to be put on my the Hilton hotel that is attached. Noticing that I was immediately turned off. If I wanted hotel breakfast I would have stayed at my hotel. They had a typical breakfast buffet and a small but surprisingly expansive breakfast menu. I ordered a build your own omelette and oats. The omelette was well made, not too overcooked, and had ample ingredients. My oats were a little raw and cold, but not enough to deter me from eating them. One of my coworkers ordered the frittata and it came out looking like sliced meatloaf. None of us were sure how it was made or why it appeared the way it did. He said that it tasted okay, but wasn't great. I wouldn't have eaten it simply based on appearance. Another corker ordered an omelette with hash browns. The first order of hash browns came out covered in heavy black pepper, so she sent them back to be remade. The second order came out and they tasted like sour milk.   Maybe the actual restaurant is good (the ambiance seemed nice and the decor was pretty), but this hotel breakfast was not the best.",

We were instantly impressed by the decor & atmosphere and it helped that we were seated rather quickly.   The menu (on the lower level - more casual/bar-like atmosphere) was expansive enough that there was something available for everyone, yet it wasn't overwhelming.   We all decided to get a couple apps in shareable sized portions: Cheese curds Lobster fritters Twice baled fingerling potatoes Mesclun salad Heirloom spinach salad Chicago style cheese pizza Pepperoni & mushroom New York style pizza  Everything was so amazing and none of us disliked any appetizer that we ordered. The portions were just enough for all of us to share and it was nice to be able to try many different things. The service was impeccable and Tyler (our waiter) was very attentive to everything and so friendly. The manager and chef also came to our table multiple times to check on us. I felt that prices were reasonable for the area and the portions we received. I would go back here in a heartbeat and I can't wait for my next visit.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a highly anticipated Happy hour with coworkers. The 5 of us were seated in the downstairs section immediately and I instantly inquired about any specials. Unfortunately, \"because they are new\" they don't offer HH specials yet. That seemed odd but we carried on, browsed the food and drink menu and decided on beverages and a few sides.   I started with a cocktail named, The Fire of 1845. Jalapeno infused vodka, ginger beer, habanero bitters and mint. Two of my coworkers also got this drink. If you enjoy a little kick in your mouth but also appreciate the depth of flavor in a well made cocktail, this drink is for you! I ordered this for a second round and I can't wait to go back and order it again! The other two in our group stuck to IPA beer.  We decided not to order dinner so we picked three sides. Two orders of fries (one BBQ and one garlic parm) and I ordered a side of the seasoned wild mushrooms. Fries didn't wow me. The BBQ flavor didn't pull through and the garlic parm needed salt. The mushrooms were excellent and the portion size was great. I will order these again.   Service was good. Our waitress timely and professional.  The decor is beautiful and I am looking forward to exploring the upstairs section next time I stop in!",

The Atmoshere was lovely, the food, spectacular - I had their crab cake - nothing but delicious, buttery, jumbo lumps of crab meat, served with awesome creamed corn and wild mushrooms!!!!!  The service was amazing!!!  Very friendly staff all the way around!!!!!  Food came out fast and hot!!!!! After dinner, we went upstairs to Roost for a cocktail and to check out their fine dining area - beautifully decorated and, albeit pricier than Revel, their menu looks amazing - can't wait to eat there next time!!!!!  The bartenders at Roost were wonderfully attentive and entertaining even on a very busy night!!!! Really looking forward to a return trip soon!!!!!  Well worth the $$$!!!!!!!",

The menu is limited so it took us no time to decide. They had eight tables filled so it wasn't busy. Just not impressed.",

    "text": "There was a nice vibe in the room Saturday night at 745 when we entered. Although the restaurant was just about full, we were given a comfortable four top even though we were only two - the restaurant honors reservations.  Dating couples seated in the windows and a large group celebrating a birthday. We were able to have a conversation despite the energy level in the room.  We began with a glass of fine Dr. Loosen Riesling and the restaurant's Fire of 1845 vodka/ginger beer/mint cocktail - the latter refreshing and a definite bargain at $8.  We shared the duck.foie gras ballotine en croute as a starter. This was one of the more authentically French presentations I have experienced in the States, and the trumpet mushrooms were a nice lagniappe. It just tasted right.  Bread arrived next - biscuits and home made bread on a plank with a spicy pepper jam and honey butter. The biscuits were fantastic more should be brought.  Moved onto a glass of Persona Non Grata.  I had the rib steak, which disappointed slightly. There was a nice crust on the outside, but that was at the expense of the center which was closer to medium well than the requested medium rare. The creamy mashed potatoes underneath were superb, and the french beans were perfectly cooked. I'd have plumped for a slightly thicker steak for a few more $.   My partner's butter poached halibut was the better choice. The accompanying sunchoke had been scooped into spheres which looked like onions.  We would have had the blood orange cake for dessert but our over taxed server took too long.  Note to Roost -- the tables in the window needed to be cleared faster.  Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant, and if you are staying at the HGI the convenience cannot be overlooked.",

The shrimp were grilled perfect and the hint of old bay added just the right amount of spice to perfectly prepared grits. Great staff and very knowledgeable of their menu. Plenty of wait staff and runners. Overall great place to eat. I'll be back on my next business trip to Pittsburgh.  Came back to try breakfast this trip into town. Again the food is wonderful, however breakfast service may not be their forte.  They were late opening by ten minutes the hostess seated me but was never at the hostess station to seat any of the patrons that came in after me. They only had one server working and she seemed to only have one speed slow.  I'll stick to lunch for this one.",

Oddly when we first asked the waiter for input regarding what we ordered, he was very blase and without any comment about them. Also, presented the waiter the 1 inch crack in my rocks glass and he simply brought another glass and transferred the bourbon into it! Just a less than average waiter, unlike the staff at several other Pittsburgh restaurants such as those in the Big Burrito Group.  The menu is very creative, not overly extensive so that you don't know what to choose. I had the spinach heirloom salad, followed by sun shrimp & grits. Very tasty, spicy and nice portion size.",

We ordered the single cheese plate.  It was surprisingly large and definitely tasty.  We shared it between two people and it was plenty big.

The filet was thick and it was still juicy. I ate the 1/3 that was hanging off of the bun and it was delicious. It came with house made chips that were light and crispy. They had a seasoning salt that made them tastier than just regular sea salt. The whole \"you can't eat just one\" slogan came into play.  I definitely want to go back and try other dishes.

We, being of Southern persuasion know our way around some fried yardbird, skillet or pressure fried, bucket, box or white tablecloth. This misrepresentation of a dear favorite was borderline offensive. A Gummy skinned thyme and sage bomb topped with some pickled vegetables in an unlined paper bucket.   It was clear that this bird was improperly seasoned, dredged and washed before frying. Then it was fried at too low a temp to set the skin. After it was just dumped from oil to bucket with no time to drain. It just became a sweaty mess of doughy, greasy protein. We couldn't even finish it. To make matters worse it wasn't even edible cold and everyone knows even cold fried chicken is good fried chicken if done right.   It's very disappointing to spend $30 on a single fried bird that fails on all accounts. I dont think we will return.",

Fries were over peppered.  Nearly a whole dish of the communal cheese curds remained unbeaten among a party of 12 adults.  The kids remarked that the curds tasted just like their salty burgers.  My spicy chicken sandwich was a 3 out of 5, maybe.  So, if you visit, maybe ask them to ease up on the seasoning.",

The sides are unique and tasteful, make sure to order some to try. Also The fire of 1845 (or something like that) is a spicy cocktail that they have on the menu really good if you like spicy.

    "text": "I ate at Revel and in Roost and I'll say that both parts of this restaurant are amazing.    Firstly, we made reservations at Roost in the beginning of October.  The atmosphere of Roost is nice, I wouldn't consider it a romantic atmosphere but it was very nice.  Our waitress was incredible.  The service was great.  There was a moment when we had finished our meals and our waitress came over to apologize for the delay because she had a big table she was waiting on.  However, we did not think there was any delay and were not even concerned with how long we were waiting for her.  In addition to our waitress, we had about three other different individuals come over and refill our water and clear our table.  We never had to ask for more water, they were on top of it.  You can tell the servers/water servers put a lot of effort into their jobs. I really liked that.  Next, the food was amazing.  I had the brisket for appetizer while my husband had the gumbo.  Both appetizers were really good.  I had the Duck Confit Pasta and my husband had the Shrimp and Grits for our entrees.  Both were great! In fact, the shrimp and grits was so good we had to go back and get it for lunch in Revel!  And this coming Saturday we have reservations and will most likely be getting the Shrimp and Grits again.  It was one of the best shrimp and grits we have ever had.   For dessert I had the Salted Caramel Panna Cotta - oh my God it was SOO GOOD.  My husband had the brownie sundae which was kind of boring and the brownie was dry.  That was probably the only thing I didn't love about this place.  I do not recommend that dessert.    When were in Revel for lunch, again, the service was great.  My husband got the Shrimp and Grits and this time I got the Quail and Waffles.  It was really good.  It was a single serving and satisfied me just enough, however, I probably could have eaten the communal serving size myself. The atmosphere inside Revel is more laid back and comfortable. They have a big screen and you can see into part of the kitchen where they have a fire for pizza making.  I always think that is need to watch them cook pizza.    All and all this place was great and look forward to eating there many times in the future.  This Saturday is their Halloween Bash and I already made reservations, I am excited to dress up and eat some good food Saturday night.  This place is definately worth 5 stars!",

    "text": "After hearing a variety of reviews on Revel + Roost I decided to check things out for myself. I met some friends at Revel after work for dinner and drinks. The first thing I was impressed with was their happy hour. It goes until 7pm and includes a variety of different drink specials.   The waitstaff was extremely attentive and knowledgeable on the menu. We started with the single Quail and Waffles and communal Cheese Plate. The waiter directed us in the right direction regarding what size dish to order. The single Quail and Waffles portion was plenty for the four of us to share and the communal Cheese Plate was large and more than enough for four people.   Then, we decided to get a pizza to share and some French fries.  While these aren't gourmet menu items, they were well prepared and tasty.  We were all able to get 2-3 drinks during happy hour which cut back on our bill. It was a very reasonably priced dinner and we all left with full stomachs.   All in all, our experience was wonderful and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "For our appetizers, the BBQ short ribs tasted good but were not tender, and the crab cakes contained vegetables but were still meaty. For our entrees, the petit filet mignons were a bit overcooked but were flavored nicely with crab meat and scallops. The waitress was prompt and polite. The seating area had few customers and was very quiet. Overall, I did enjoy my dinner at this restaurant, and I recommend that more customers give it a try.",

    "text": "Okay, y'all.  I wanted to be more impressed with this than I was.  I'm really feeling the decor--it's definitely more on the chic end of the hipster continuum than likes of, say, Meat & Potatoes or Butcher & the Rye.  And the service was fine.  What was really \"meh\" was the food. I took a friend for lunch. She ordered a burger and seemed to like it (didn't comment and ate the whole thing), and I got a chicken and apple Panini with a side of fries.  The Panini, I'm sad to say, tasted reminiscent of a Lean Cuisine Panini sandwich.  I think it was the cheese that seemed a bit off.  And the fries seemed like the ones that are left at the bottom of the bag--a lot of scappy pieces compared to the nice long intact ones.  For the price of the meal, it was just \"ok\".  I would, however, give this place another shot for an after work happy hour.",
