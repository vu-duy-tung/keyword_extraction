    "text": "This is not my first rodeo at Lin's, but it is the first time my husband and I have been here with their sushi bar open. I started with Egg Flower soup, which is pretty standard as an egg drop soup goes but served very hot (keep the ice water close by!). He put in an order for a blue crab Philadelphia roll at the same time we ordered our entrees, white meat sesame chicken / broccoli and vegetable lo mein. The chicken is delicious and their lo mein is always spot on. The roll didn't come until after the entrees and he wasn't impressed. The roll was much too large and the presentation was sloppy. No soy sauce for dipping was brought to the table until requested and there was less than a pea sized dollop of wasabi. He said he would have sushi here again but they have a lot of work to do. Hopefully this service will improve with more experience. Overall, Lin's is a good choice for Chinese food but Nakama or Little Tokyo is preferential for sushi as of now.",

I mean honestly how can you screw that up?   Well Lins did. The gyoza were burnt and the beef and broccoli/general tsos was bland. Apparently as far as the southside is concerned good Chinese might be a rarity.  I guess I'm done ordering Chinese from Lins I'll stick to china house in bloomfield.",

We both started off with soups Tofu Veggie for me and Egg Drop for him. My soup had big chunks of veggies and tofu in a tasty broth.  I order the Curry which was a yellow curry with shrimp and veggies. I thought it was strange that they only offered one kind of curry. The dish came with rice and the portion was huge! It was solid and spicy. Service was attentive but the place was dead!   PROS: Cheap, BYOB, nice interior, friendly staff, large menu with different protein options, large vegetarians options   CONS: The food was good but it didn't blow me away, the place was dead on a saturday night ( like 2 other tables), quiet   OVERALL: Might come back for a quick bite but its not going to be a \"Go-To\" for me.

    "text": "I was driving by when I saw their sign for Boba Tea -- I knew I had to go in.  My love affair with milk teas and tapioca pearls will never end.  Morgan hit the nail on the head when she said they have few flavors.  I was surprised to see that there are less than 15 flavors on their menu.  What made it worse is that they don't have almond.  How can any Asian place NOT have almond flavor?    I moved on and ordered the Taro milk tea with pearls.  For those that have never tasted Taro, it tastes quite a bit like pecan.  After I paid, I received my purple drink and ran out the door like a child with a new toy.  As I took my first sip, I was a bit shocked due to the sweetness.  Wow!  That was a lot of sugar.  My next trip, I ordered the honeydew at the suggestion of the associate behind the counter.  I told her that I wanted it less sweet.  She said she only put in a drop of the sugar compared to what they normally put in.  Amazing how the sugar can mask the flavor of the milk tea.  While I enjoyed the honeydew, it wasn't a flavor that I would crave.  On my third trip, I ordered the taro again and this time had them put in only a drop of sugar.  It was SO much better.  While I will never crave the taro, it will definitely help quell my need for milk teas.  Talking to the owner, I learned that the remaining flavors she carries are the flavors that actually sell in the area.  I wonder if she would order the almond or pineapple flavors for me if I paid for them?",

The last time I had Asian food in the Southside it was at a shady place that looked more like a Laundromat than a restaurant and the food tasted a lot like gasoline. The interior of this place is beautiful. High ceilings, large windows in the front (both times I've been there they've been wide open and inviting in the fresh air), and a great color palette. I've heard though that on the weekends in the evening the open windows sometimes invite in not only fresh air, but also some solicitation from the roaming homeless and drunks either asking for money or doling out insults or sexual harassment to the restaurants customers.    I've been in twice now and both times I've chosen items off of the lunch/dinner menus as they were quick and clear in what was included. The staff was quick and friendly, I even had a chance to speak to the owner at length about future plans to better and expand his business. While it does have that slight air of a new business just getting off the ground, it's not at all reflected in the food options. I definitely recommend this as an option when you're looking for a break from the usual bar food found on Carson Street.",

I ordered just a milk tea, which was served up within a few minutes. You can taste the tea, though it has a bit of a strange, artificial aftertaste.

    "text": "I am very glad I never ordered delivery from this place before I stopped in there this Sunday. Put these clues together: The menu was ragged and torn, then laminated over the tears and missing hunks of paper, then the lamination was peeling off  over half-way and the whole thing was sticky. The table tent signs were also covered in flecks and bits of food. The dining roon staff were inattentive and seemed inexperienced and a little awkward around adults. I ordered some tea and was perusing the menu for what might be safest food. It was pouring down rain and I was on foot without an umbrella and hungry. Call it serendipity that I stopped in. I went back to the restrooms and the air freshener smell in the ladies room was suspiciously strong - think about the air freshener scene from the movie Se7en. Well, it would be suspicious except you have to walk past the kitchen to get there and I couldn't even smell food cooking - only a strong smell of mold and a well-represented smell of sewage back-flow to go with it. It could have been the result of old architecture near the river in a low place with a downpour outside - not their fault, but not my problem either. I was actually embarrased for the proprietors, so I ordered a couple small things to go and tipped the waitress. Forunately, the order arrived as the rain was slowing. I left and tossed the food completely untouched in a trash can down by 18th Street.",

After some negotiations, she said she would only take meal off, which still wasn't going to work.  After about 15 minutes, she finally agreed to only charge us for the food we ate.

If you order a smoothie bubble drink, ask for it in a to-go cup. TRUST ME. I ordered a pineapple smoothie and it came heaped into a little martini glass, spilling all over the place and dripping down the sides. Also, I had no idea how to approach drinking it. My meal was good. I sat outside and the waitress kept coming out to tell me \"not to rush,\" I wasn't, but for some reason that made me feel a little uncomfortable!",

    "text": "I really prefer to visit a place a few times before rendering a verdict, especially when the menu is varied, but I was so pleased to discover the pad thai at Lin's is pretty delicious that I have to let Yelp know right now.  I now work in the South Side, but far enough off Carson that most of the delicious restaurant offerings aren't within walking distance (given a half hour for lunch). I noticed Lin's as I drove in to work one day and decided I needed to give it a shot; this was only reinforced after a coworker went for lunch and deemed it Tasty.  So, on a payday, my craving for pad thai won, and I called in an order. I asked if they had bubble tea; it's not listed on the takeout menu, but they do, so I added a milk tea on to my order. I walked down and my order was ready when I got there -- perfect timing. I did have to wait for them to make the tea, but I understand that it doesn't make sense to prep an iced drink ahead of time and have it sitting there getting warm and watered down.  The pad thai was pretty darn good. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but I liked it more than I like, say, Lulu's. Which I also like! So that's a win. It's got that combination of hot and sour and sweet and salty that is what really makes me crave it, and the shrimp were plump and flavorful. I'd definitely have this again, and am in fact contemplating getting it today, now that I'm thinking about it.  The bubble tea was good, fairly standard bubble tea. Plenty of tapioca pearls, thankfully, and a good, strong black tea flavor. I couldn't find the bubble tea flavors listed while I was in the restaurant, either. I wish they'd make them more obvious.  All in all, it's no Thai Cuisine or Thai Suan Thip, but as a quick and reasonably priced takeout lunch at work, Lin's gets four stars from me.",

    "text": "First, let me break down the 3 star rating: If it were not for the prompt correction and customer service, my experience would have warranted 1 star and Lin's would have landed on my restaurant black list (dun dun dun)   It all started out so well. My date and I were craving sushi and it was Labor day. We used our trusty Yelp app to filter sushi restaurants in the 'Burgh but we struck out with the first four restaurants that we called. To our delight, Lin's was open & they had a salmon and tuna sushi special. Score!  We settled on a to-go order of spicy shrimp and vegetable vermicelli noodles, a spicy salmon roll and a tuna lover's roll. We picked the spicy salmon roll because even though the ingredients were not listed, we've had many spicy salmon rolls from other restaurants and the recipe has never been anything but rice, seaweed wrap, salmon & spicy sauce. The ingredients listed for the tuna roll did not include tempura and that is the reason we chose that roll. My date and I both avoid gluten so tempura is a big no no.   Once we picked up the food & settled back in my apartment with our gluten free soy sauce, we were excited to dive into the rolls. That excitement was gone in a hot second when we realized that the spicy salmon roll used tempura as a filler! Instead of using more fish, the sushi chef rolled the salmon in tempura and loaded it into the roll. We opened our Tuna lover's roll and found the same issue!! Let me remind you that tempura was NOT listed in the ingredients for the Tuna lover's roll. At this point, we were unable to eat both of our rolls so my date called Lin's. He explained our situation and they told us that while we should have asked for the specific ingredients of the spicy salmon roll, we were correct about the tuna lover's roll. They offered to re-make our rolls and we could come back down to pick them up. My date had to be at the airport that evening so we were crunched for time. Lin's didn't hesitate, quickly took down my address and about 30 min later, their delivery driver arrived with two fresh, tempura free rolls. He apologized & explained that they hired a new sushi chef and that he tends to make rolls his way rather than following the menu and they are actively trying to fix the issue.  While I believe the driver, I am very disappointed that their sushi chef's method of making rolls is to use tempura as a filler. It's ultimately a cost saver for the restaurant and cut in quality for the consumer. Lin's sushi rolls are not any cheaper than average so the quality shouldn't be either. Due to Lin's customer service & correction, I will not write them off. In fact, I will make sure to ask about their tempura filler the next time I order sushi to see if the problem is corrected...and that's my advice to all of you!",

My husband read the description for his food which didn't have anywhere in it that it contained shrimp. He has a shellfish allergy. When we got our food and his had shrimp in it he immediately called to inform them of the situation. The manager got on the phone and was very rude. He blamed us for not calling to see what was in it and said he didn't make the website so it's not his fault for it being left out of the description. Then he said there is nothing we can do for you if you don't want to waste the food bring it back and I'll eat it. Then he hung up. Very unprofessional and disrespectful.",

    "text": "My boys and husband would eat Chinese food every day of the week if they could. All four of us were able to have dinner together. It was a little bit of a celebration for my oldest son buying his first car. We all like Lin's so we headed there for dinner.  There are so many great things about Lin's. They have great Bubble Tea, appetizers, and lots of entrees. We started with Crab Rangoon. They are crispy shells filled with crab and cream goodness that come with a dipping sauce that makes a great bite.  We ordered Triple Delight, Street Noodles, Sesame Chicken, and Beef Noodle soup.  The Beef Noodle soup comes out in a big white bowl and smells heavenly. It has pieces of beef, beef broth, huge/thick Udon noodles, mushrooms,  and ski sees of carrots and other veggies. They also bring you out a shaker of \"Magic Seasoning\". I don't know what's in it but you definitely have to put some in your soup.  It brings out even more flavor. They have a Grilled Chicken Noodle soup that's even better. (IMHO).  The Sesame Chicken is small bites of chicken that are quick fried, plated with broccoli and rice and is finished with a sauce that is a little bit sweet but also savory. Sesame seeds are the icing on the cake.  Triple Delight is Beef, Chicken and Shrimp with mushrooms and veggies like carrots, celery and broccoli. It has a savory brown sauce that brings the 3 proteins together.  The Street Noodles are slim noodles that have the color of a yellow curry and smell a bit like curry. It is a little spicy but not so hot that you burn your taste buds.  It's good to know that any time you walk in you are going to be eating hot, fresh, and flavorful food.",

We get home and realize instead of one of our meals, we had an order of potstickers, not even close. So I call, and they tell us to bring the potstickers back to the restaurant in order to receive our food...are you kidding?? They were open for another hour, couldn't have driven it over and we could've exchanged it? They explained that no one else ordered potstickers so they don't know why we got them and that's why we had to bring them back...how is it our fault that the kitchen messed up?

Delivery almost always arrives much sooner than expected, they also give you silverwear (which is always exciting), the food always arrives super hot, and the delivery people are very nice. I only ever order via grubhub or foodler because I prefer to not speak to humans when I order food, so I can't say much for the friendliness of the people who answer the phones. All in all, I 100% recommend this place. Then teriyaki chicken is really good, but again... Cantonese Egg Noodles for the win.",

The inside isn't huge, but feels roomy and is decorated well to provide for a pleasant atmosphere.  Lin's has, in my opinion, one of those menus where you really can't miss on what you order. The combination lunches/dinners are a fantastic deal at under $10 and are more than enough food. These boxes include a combination of two of their dishes with fried rice and an egg roll (dinner box only).   The sushi is also very good and I've yet to have a complaint about it. They run a lunch special of 2 sushi rolls for $8 which has become a staple for our office on our lunch break. I believe that you can also add a sushi roll and soup/salad to any entree for an additional $3 or $4.  This review has got my mouth watering, it may be a Lin's lunch kinda day!",

The lunch specials have small portions and don't quite satisfy what you really wanted (pre-determined combinations of three options that usually have two you were interested in and one that you wish could be subbed out).  As with most Chinese joints, the trick at Lin's is to order right to achieve maximum food success. You'll find your own path after a few trial-and-errors, but I've learned to stay away from the crab rangoon and egg rolls in favor of the gyoza and hot and sour soup. When it comes to entrees, my favorites include the lo mein, the seafood udon noodle soup, and the coconut chicken. Don't be fooled by how cheap the combination bentos are: your best bet is to order family-style.",

The flavors are clean and while some of the sauces can be a bit sticky-sweet, it never is to the point where you don't know what you are eating or feel like you just had dessert instead of a meal.  My favorite thing on the menu has to be their Hot and Sour Soup.  It is definitely one of the best you will find in the area.  It is actually both spicy and sour with a hint of sesame in the background.  Not over spiced and not overpowered by vinegar.  It has a wonderfully full flavor and the bits of meat, tofu and mushrooms work wonderfully in it.  Their lunch special bento boxes are an awesome way to taste multiple main dishes on the cheap as you figure out what your favorites are.  Other great things are: All of their sushi - very fresh and very tasty Schezwan anything Pan-fried wonton with garlic sauce (SOOOO GOOOOOOD!!)  Go.  Order.  Enjoy.  You won't be sorry.",

I'll be honest, it took us a few trial and error moments and a brief hiatus for us to get our order right, but now we have it down.   Here it is:  - Triple delight w/ fried rice - Mixed meat udon - Honey chicken w/ steamed rice  Sometimes if we're feeling crazy we'll add: - Singapore Mai Fun - Crab Rangoons - Soup of any kind  We've also eaten in the restaurant and have never had a bad experience.",

The honey chicken is to die for because it's so crunchy and sweet. The general tso chicken is also really delicious.   They usually aren't super busy, but tonight my friends and I caught them at a pretty busy time, so it took a while to get service. I've never had this problem before though. We went around 6 on a Saturday night, so that's prime time. Everything else was great about our meal.  Update: came here again the other day with my boyfriend and we had a great experience. Our server Melanie was awesome and happy to take care of us! Our food was so tasty, and the mixed drinks were great too.",

I've honestly come here around twenty times and still it's always so darn good. They have amazing lunch specials and they always have a lot of open seats. Even in the summer they set up tables outside and the windows even open up in front of the building. The service here is quick and I think there's something for everyone on here from sushi to soups to rice dishes and noodles. My personal favorite is the general tso and Kong pow chicken. This place is also always clean and well organized and they even make the sushi right in front of you if you sit in the front at the bar area. This place might look and feel very Americanized but the food is outstanding. Overall I'll continue to come here when I'm craving Chinese or in the area for lunch.",

    "text": "I've had a few friends say this is their favorite restaurant in all of Southside. So when helping a friend move I suggested that we go here. Or maybe she's just suggested that we go there either or it was a good choice.  We walked in and we got seated right away and we just missed the lunch special. While slightly disappointed the full menu was still available and it looked very good.  My friend knew right away what she wanted since she has lived in the south side and comes here lot. I need the little bit more time to look through all the pages. I was pretty impressed with the different options that Lin's had. And I put it on my list to come again to try different options from the menu, after the food was tasted of course.  I went with the eggplant tofu with a side of noodles and she went with one of the Bento boxes. All I know from her bento box is that she got some Sesame crispy tofu and it was delicious and I will be getting that the next time that I come.  My dish came on a plate kind of like a fajita. It was very steamy and sizzling for a lot longer than I would have liked because it was so hot I couldn't eat it. And then I also felt bad because the steam was just blowing into my friend's face. She was a good sport and said that she liked it and she said it was like a steam bath with delicious flavors. But it still made me feel a little bit bad.   The eggplant was cooked perfectly and all the vegetables were delicious. The sauce was light and did not overtake everything and didn't give me that sticky feeling of heaviness that some Asian sauces do. I think that I would have liked crispy tofu instead of just the regular tofu because it probably would have stayed together easier. But all in all the meal was very good.  I look forward to trying more things on the menu especially their sushi and their bento box. And a little taste of that Sesame tofu has had me hooked and waiting to go back soon to get some of that. If you're in the Southside try it out.",

The L5 is fantastic if you do not like spicy food, its chicken on a stick and sweet and sour chicken.  The L8 is another good option if you are not a fan of spicy food. Its chicken or shrimp Lo Mein wit chicken on a stick.   Most of the above mentioned chicken options can be shrimp, but I am not a fan of shrimp.   If you want a larger sized meal I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef. its a fair mix of meat to veggies. Its not too sweet and has the perfect amount of spice.

The portions were pretty small for the price they charged, and most importantly they were bland. All three meals were practically flavorless, slathered in syrupy sauces that coated your mouth and just made you feel like a terrible person.  Service also used to be great. The staff was friendly and helpful, but that wasn't what I experienced yesterday. People were unsmiling, lounging on counters and playing on phones.

    "text": "1.5 stars. The food that my boyfriend and I ordered from Lin's Asian Fusion was awful. Not the worst I have ever had, but very low quality and bland. Between the two of us, we ordered the 'egg flower' soup, crab rangoons, coconut chicken and beef and broccoli.  The rangoons had next to no filling and the little filling that there was consisted of cream cheese and sugar--no crabmeat (or even imitation crabmeat) in sight. The soup resembled plain water with garlic powder in it so I ate one spoonful and tossed it. The coconut chicken was mostly fried dough with a few ounces  of gristly chicken thigh meat. The sauce was okay, but nothing I would order again. I did like the pineapple chunks that were part of this dish. The fried rice on the side was flavorless, mushy and had no seasoning or fried egg. HOW DOES A TAKEOUT PLACE MESS UP FRIED RICE?! My boyfriend had the beef and broccoli and said it was terrible and the steamed rice he had with it was a starchy sticky blob. To top off the bad food, our bag came with 2 soy sauce packets and a plastic spoon-- no forks, chopsticks, napkins, etc. The only reason that I am rounding up to two stars instead of down to one is that this is not the worst 'chinese food' that I have ever had. I will not be giving Lin's my business ever again. And the search continues for a decent Chinese takeout spot in the southside...",

I've ordered something different every time (always vegetarian), and every time I've been really happy with, and sometimes blown away by, the food.  Lunch portions are great, with lots of fresh veggies.   I really didn't want to like this place more than Thai Me Up which is right across the street, but I have to say--this is the best Asian food in the Southside.",

The waitress was super friendly. So we finally got our  food my roommates food looked nothing like kung pao and my honey chicken was pretty much chicken less burnt and awful tasting. The waitress offered to have the cook make us something else which they did. So when it came to check time they tried to charge us for both meals. Even though the cook made us the wrong food and over cooked mine they tried to charge us for a meal we didn't eat. Then when we refused to pay for it because they offered to remake our food the cook tried to hagle w/ us.  I will never eat here again.",

    "text": "We ordered take-out Chinese on a cold snowy day. Prior to placing the order, we called to confirm that they were in fact delivering, and they reassured us they would could deliver in 45-60 minutes. We live approximately 5 blocks away and had a very small order (two lunches) so were confident this could happen and placed our order. They did not arrive for an hour and forty minutes. We were not too upset--the weather was bad and these things happen; although, had they been honest and told us it would be an hour and forty minutes, we would have bundled and walked the 5 blocks.There was only 2 inches of snow...hardly the worst weather conditions for Pittsburgh.  We also learned that the first driver wasn't able to come so our food was prepared about an hour before we actually received it, and the quality showed--it was cold and dry. Pretty terrible, but we were starving and aren't really complainers--we even still tipped them 20% Then, the real kicker came: we got a call that they would be returning to our house to collect money for two sodas they forgot to charge us for. After delivering our food 50 minutes late, and letting it sit an hour, and still receiving a tip, they wanted their money for soda. Funny enough, when they wanted to come collect their $4, they arrived to our house within 10 minutes. I complained about how late our lunch was to the manager and that it is disappointing that he would have a driver make an extra trip to collect the money for the sodas after our food was so late and so cold and terrible. He said he apologized but the roads were \"really bad.\"  Hmm...but not so bad to keep you from coming back for your $4?! In the end, I told him to take the $3 tip already paid and gave him one dollar so that they returned to our house, in \"really bad weather\" for a single dollar.  As a side note, even with perfect customer service and under the best conditions, the taste and quality of the food would be similar to that of a food court in the mall. If you're in the Southside and want cheap but good Chinese food, go for Chan An.",
