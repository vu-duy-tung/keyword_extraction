There were lots of peanut shells on the floor, even though each table received an empty bucket for their shells. The ribs were tender and quite delicious. The smothered chicken was also a great choice. The tossed salad was quite large. It was prepared with fabulous homemade croutons, as well as homemade dressings. For an extra charge, you can get your sweet potato or baked potato smothered with some great toppings. Our server was quite sweet. A few of the servers participated in a line dance, but some did not appear to be enjoying themselves.",

The food quality has dropped and the prep of the food is even worse. Portions are rather inconsistent  as well. Not sure what is going on at this unit but it definitely needs work. Maybe I'm the one that is goofy because this place seems very busy most times. Perhaps it is the BOOMING loud atmosphere. Peanuts? Could it be the constant singing and jumping around of the staff? Whatever it is, I have dropped this place way down on my list. For a few bucks more you can find a much better product and a more suitable atmosphere in which to consume it. Dinner for two ran $50 before tip with no alcohol and one app which was a grease soaked (and I mean soaked) blooming onion. Do what you will but don't get into a car accident rushing to the Bridgeville Texas Roadhouse.",

It finally came after our appetizer had been eaten. I had to ask for water twice before getting it. The waitress never asked if my boyfriend wanted a margarita refill, he waited with an empty glass for 10 minutes so I gave him mine. The service all around was very poor. When dinner finally came, we ordered sandwiches, and the fries did not come out with them. The pulled pork sandwich was extremely dry. At that point all we wanted were boxes to go home. Right when we received our check I waved a manager over and discussed the situation. We still wanted to pay but he insisted he would take care of it.",

The loaded baked potato was awesome and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. For two meals it only cost me less than $30. $15 a person for two steak dinners isn't bad! My only complaint was the salad I ordered before my meal. It wasn't bad but some the lettuce was a little hard and seemed to be from the core of the head. That just grosses me out.

Service was slow and neglectful. Hard to get refills, or napkins when a spill occurred. A salad ordered without croutons came with them on. Salmon ordered with the butter sauce on the side came like that but also still cooked and drenched in butter. We finally got a hold of a manger who remade the salmon and came back with salmon that was not cooked thoroughly, did not ask for a 3 try. Also, I ordered the steak fries, there is no mention that they come with seasoning. I told the manager that I could not eat them (due to allergies) when she removed the salmon. She never offered to replace them with another side. The salmon came back alone. And yes, we were charged in full.",

I still had a blast with all the family and of course teasing my cousin in law about his upcoming leap into the big 5-0 area of life.  Everyone's entries looked good, most of the kids had burgers and fries. Everyone who had steak said it was good.

    "text": "We have been here at least half a dozen times, and every time they have failed miserably. Why is it so hard to cook a steak to \"medium\" temperature? The last 3 visits we have had to send our bone in ribeyes back at least twice because they come out well. I wanted to pay 25.99 for a piece of shoe leather, I would stay home. Not to mention the 3 potatoes they have sent out each visit for each mistake. You would think the back of the house manager would be a little more concerned about food cost. If the front of the house manager Kelsey was a little more concerned about food quality and her guests instead of a conversation about her ex boyfriend at the bar with a friend of hers, maybe she wouldn't have fumbled the last chance of trying to save the my business and make up for the last of experience that her kitchen manager supplies. I'm sure that the line cooks only make 8.50 per hour at best, so corporate should probably take care of their employees a little better to try and keep their guests coming back. Their bone in rib eye is great, when it's cooked right. But it takes 3 or 4 wasted steaks to get that quality to their guests. At least some waitress got fed tonight if it wasn't for the food cost aspect. The ONLY positive aspects was Brittney P. Who is a fantastic server and apologetic for her lack of teamwork. She was super friendly and was on top of our beverage refills while we waited 2 hours for our meal to be edible. 5 stars for Brittney, however I wish yelp didn't make me choose 1 star for Texas Roadhouse, because they are unworthy. Next time I want a quality piece of meat, I will go to Delallos. I'm done with this overrated chain restaurant.",

    "text": "Texas Roadhouse is great for a dependable family option.  Though my kids are generally very well behaved when we are out to eat, I don't have to worry about getting the stink-eye from a neighboring table when our toddle shrieks with excitement about something.  We are early diners, so we don't often have to worry about crowds. But I highly recommend the call ahead option if you want to eat there during prime time.    Texas Roadhouse is known for their freshly baked rolls and the sweetened butter they serve with them- always a hit.  I alternate between the roasted chicken (most times very juicy and moist, but I have had several times where it was dry) and a small sirloin (well seasoned, but I tend to ask for smaller steaks cooked a level less than what I would usually ask for- i.e. medium-rare as opposed to medium).  The sides are good. The baked potato soup is really tasty.  Mashed potatoes are good.  The salads a good and generous (tip: the standard salad with a meal comes with egg on it - make sure to ask for them to omit the egg if that's not your thing).  Husband leans towards the pulled pork, as he is obsessed with it.  The kids like the chicken fingers. One area of complaint- the kids' mini hamburgers were the tiniest piece of meat I have ever seen on a bun.    Service is generally anywhere between competent to good.  On occasions where we have had a problem, management has always been quick to resolve it.  On certain occasions they will bring out plastic cowboy hats for the kids, which are a huge hit.  Warning to those of you with birthdays- if you tell them it is your birthday, they will bring out a saddle for you to sit on while they sing their happy birthday song to you!",

The salad was inferior to what I can order from the lunch room in my office building (which costs only $7). The ribs had a nice flavor but we're a bit dry. I didn't personally try the burger but it looked pretty plain and was not what I would have expected from a steak joint.

Each and every time my girlfriend and I go there we have to return our first steaks. Every... single... time. I secretly hope that the \"next\" time will be better but this last time was the same again. Even our waitress was disgusted with how bad the steaks were. Also, it just feels like a Chuck E Cheese anymore. Kids run rampant without supervision while every 15 minutes there's an anouncement that it's someone's birthday and a line-dance, stomping party follows afterward. Spare me the noise, the sodium and the atmosphere and teach your cooks how to cook.",

    "text": "My sister has classes on Tuesday nights at a dance studio nearby and I was in charge of driving her, so we stopped here to eat an hour beforehand.  At every other Texas Roadhouse I've been to, I've enjoyed myself. However, my experience at this particular location was much different.   First, the hostess was rude and hardly spoke to us. She didn't say anything as we sat down at our table, which was extremely wobbly. Also, our rolls were not brought to the table by the hostess when we were seated like they normally are. As people around us were being seated, they were immediately brought rolls and we were not. And they were NOT out of them, there were several baskets sitting up front as we walked in.   Our server, Robin, was very unexperienced. She awkwardly talked to us for a literal 4 minutes before taking our drink orders. Having previous waitressing experience, I found that this was a waste of her time and ours. She brought us our drinks and we ordered two baskets of chicken fingers, knowing that we did not have time for a steak because by that time we only had 45 minutes until my sister had dance class. Ten minutes later, Robin comes back and asks for our order... AGAIN. We explained that we had already ordered and she nervously shrugged off her mistake and assured us that our order was in the system and on it's way. We also mentioned that we needed to get out of there somewhat quickly and she assured us once more that our food would be there shortly.  FORTY MINUTES LATER, our food was still not at the table. Other guests who had been sat ten to fifteen minutes after us were munching on their steaks and ribs while we were still waiting. She came over and explained that she didn't know why our food wasn't ready and asked if we wanted our food to-go, to which I said yes. A manager brought over our food all boxed up and gave us two free appetizer cards for our next visit. She also brought over drinks in to-go cups, which I thought was a hospitable touch.  The food was hot and tasted mediocre, though my sister shoveled hers down as I sped off to the dance studio. She was late, and I was not happy eating my dinner out of a to-go box in my car.  The only reason I will be returning to this location is to use my free appetizer card.",

We ordered 1 sirloin & ribs, 2 forth worth ribeyes which they overcooked both   and 1 salmon. My sirloin even though it was medium rare tasted dry. The salmon was prepared accordingly and tasted good.  The ribeyes were supposed to be medium and came out well. So upon 2 of us eating while the other 2 waited the replacement steaks finally came out after about 10 minutes. They were juicy pink this time but the amount of fat was ridiculous. (Picture included) Obviously I was very unhappy with everything and the manager Ron initially said he'd take care of the meals. The bill came out full price and Ron basically told us oh well. That was until I intensified my voice and he took care of 1 meal. The waitress was sweet as pie and told us we were correct in what we did. It was also stated by another table that they work at Longhorne and there would never be a question upon our complaints and both meals comped because it's good business. In addition, the loaded mushrooms were doused in salt.",

He was non stop smiling, enjoyed the crayons and the Mac & cheese and apple sauce.  Birthday boy also enjoyed Texas Roadhouse.  He wanted steak and was a good enough sport to indulge his parents and participate in the birthday cheer by getting on the saddle thing and wearing the plastic cowboy hat.  We all had a good time!  The food tasted great but there were a couple mix-ups.  I ordered a 6oz medium rare and he ordered a 8oz medium, with different sides. I got his steak and he got mine but the sides were correct.  I knew my steak wasn't medium rare but didn't want to complain, but once I saw his steak, after we were eating, I realized what happened.  Too late to do anything about it so I just let him have the rest of my steak. Even with that mix up, we had a great birthday celebration.  I'm looking forward to returning.",

Our server was Dalena, she was friendly, and good keeping up with her section. What's not to like about a place where you get a pail of unshelled peanuts, and warm rolls with cinnamon butter while you wait for your steak (or other meat)?!        For an appetizer, we ordered the french fries with cheese, and bacon bits. Not bad, but nothing extraordinary. After a long week at work, I ordered the Original Frozen Margarita, for $5.25 in a nice size glass with a nicely salted rim. It hit the spot, brain freeze, and all. My daughter had an issue with her 6oz. sirloin being over done when she wanted it cooked to medium, it was quickly replaced with a perfectly cooked sirloin no questions asked. My 12 oz. Fort Worth Ribeye was perfectly seasoned, that I skipped any extra salt, pepper, or steak sauce. Hubby ordered the Country Fried Chicken, he didn't mention too much about it.        Overall, this was the first time at this Texas Roadhouse location, which was a nice change from Fridays or Applebees. The atmosphere is fun, and casual, maybe a bit too casual in some circumstances. Some of the staff seemed younger, and not really trained on dealing with customers. Nothing terrible, but something that was noticed here.",

    "text": "We visited the Washington, PA location whenever we were down that way. My wife and I were thrilled when they opened in Bridgeville. Unfortunately our first visits there were a major disappointment.  We complained to management and were persuaded to give them another try after a new management team took over. We were glad we did. The food now is actually better than the Washington, PA location. Our server Jamie was excellent as well. Our ribs and steaks were better than at any of the other chain restaurants we've tried. We thought the food was actually better than our local specialty restaurants as well. Texas Roadhouse is an excellent value for the money. Even the rolls were perfect.   The only thing we didn't see was the staff dancing. In Washington, PA the staff would do a line dance to entertain the customers. I can't say I really missed it. I always wondered who's food was getting cold while they danced.   Even though the Bridgeville location was busy the noise level was low. We could actually hold a conversation without speaking up. I'll trade the lower volume for a line dance any day.   If you're looking for an excellent steak at a good price I'd recommend giving them a try. If you were there more than 7 months ago and were less than happy you need to give them another shot.  We think you'll be glad you did.  Update 4/14: We revisited about a week ago. The service was still good and the staff was dancing. Unfortunately problems in the kitchen have re-surfaced. My steak was over cooked and my wife's cooked veggies were nearly raw. It took them three tries to get her veggies right. We complained and they did try to make amends. We hope that we just caught them on a bad night. In the meantime there's still the Washington, PA location.  Further update 12/16:  Their steaks are always over cooked, so we order ours medium rare to get the steaks to be delivered medium. Their rolls are usually slightly burnt and are not consistent in size. Still the place is a good value for the money. A six ounce steak dinner will set you back $9.99. On Tuesdays margaritas are only $2.  Further update 8/17 We've adjusted and simply order our steaks medium rare when we want medium. Great value for the money. I've upped my rating to a 4. Their birthday salutes are highly embarrassing,  but great fun.",

    "text": "Poorly managed, horrible service, kitchen is terrible.  Went here once because it was close to home, but the service was horrible, our orders were incorrect, and we got a real attitude when we complained.  Vowed never to go back, but the family wanted to give it a try, so I gave it another shot.    After placing our order, our waitress completely disappeared.  After 25 minutes, my wife's order came out.  At 40 minutes, I flagged down a manager and asked if he could look into where our order was.  He also promptly disappeared.  How about some communications on why our order is taking so long or an apology, or something?  Finally, at about 50 minutes, our food arrives.  The kids ribs were so burnt and dry they were inedible.  My order was not even complete!  They were still waiting on half of it.  AFTER AN HOUR?    We complained to the waitress, who told us that the kitchen was in bad shape and was angry with us for mentioning it.  5 minutes later, the manager finally re-appears with the rest of my meal, and again gives us attitude.  He too explains that it was the kitchen, and seems mad at us for being upset.  No apologies and no offer to make it right.  My wife complained and had to ask for some kind of compensation, so he begrudgingly took some money off of our meal.      The rest of the food was fair at best, certainly not worth the aggravation of dealing with that staff, the wait or the attitudes.  Never again.",

One was requested to be medium well and was brought out as  charred dry charcoal.  The other was requested to be medium rare and had only a sliver of red down the center.  Both where pretty flavorless ass well.  They did offer to cook new ones but after waiting forever for the first two we where not interested.  To top it off my son (whom I was trying to get to finish his salad) proceeds to take a bite of salad then pull a long black hair outta his mouth.  Needless to say he wouldn't finish the salad.

There seems to be a lot of turnover since the wait staff is mostly high school and college kids, but that's to be expected at a chain restaurant in the suburbs. My only major complaint is that they make these poor kids \"line dance\" once an hour. PLEASE stop doing this! Nobody likes it!

The steak is normally not nearly as good as the other lower priced steak chains (last night, mine was perfect on the inside, but too charred in parts and honestly that's the best they've ever done with a steak for me). I guess they're a BIT cheaper than those, but I'd rather pay a bit more. The bread and butter are great, but it does get me to use butter, which I normally avoid, so I'm not sure it's the best thing.",

    "text": "This is my favorite steakhouse. I know it's a chain, but it's just so fun and the food is always plentiful and delicious.  I always have to start off with fried pickle chips; they are tangy and the batter is light enough to not be overpowering. I usually substitute the homemade ranch dressing in place of the blossom sauce, which is also good, but I think it's too much flavor for the small pickle chips.  My SO got a half rack of ribs with a Caesar salad and a loaded baked potato. By the time the food came out, he was almost stuffed from the rolls and salad! The Caesar salad is definitely his favorite. He isn't a huge fan of dryer ribs, he likes them to be coated and sticky in BBQ sauce, but these fall off the bone unlike some other dry ribs which can be tough. Also, he gets a side of the BBQ sauce to dip the ribs in.   I got a combo of chicken fingers and a half rack of ribs, with a side house salad and a cup of chili, and I too was almost full by the time the meal came out. The house salad is always delicious and very cold with chopped iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, diced eggs, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped bacon, and some homemade croutons on top. The house ranch dressing is so incredibly good and I cannot help myself to just pour the whole cup on top right when it comes out, even if I don't need it all. :D  The chili was absolutely underwhelming and quite gross. It looked and smelled good, and was topped with shredded cheese and onions, but it tasted a week old and out of a can. I took one bite and pushed it far away from me and quickly asked the waiter to take it. I double checked the menu and it does say they make it homemade, but it does not taste like it is. It tasted like Hormel canned chili and I will not ever get it again! Yuck.   The chicken fingers were very unique- they were definitely hand breaded and fried; the batter was soft and not crunchy at all, but they were very good in a home style way. They would be really good dipped in gravy. Again the ribs are the dry smoked kind but they fall off the bone and I like to drizzle a bit of steak sauce on top.    There is absolutely never a time when you can get dessert, just face it. The good thing is I am not a dessert person, so that doesn't affect me. However, you need to be very hungry and in some type of expandable waistband pants to even set foot in here. Haha I'm not kidding! It is an awesome choice for a birthday, a date night, or a night out with friends! Also, a side note, a manager almost always stops by to make sure your meal was to your liking, a nice touch. Check it out, you won't be disappointed! If you are, I give you permission to come find me and yell at me for recommending it. :)",

Cons: Our waitress, Katie, was AWFUL. First of all, she never paid attention to our waters. There were several times with 2-3 people out of our 5 people group were left without water and had to stop her and ask. Second of all, my steak, which I asked for done medium well came out medium rare. She set the steaks down and ran off, so I didn't even have time to tell her it wasn't cooked correctly. After 10 minutes of waiting and everyone else at my table was done eating, I asked another waitress if she could have my steak thrown back on the grill. By the time I got my steak back, after I told the manager that I was waiting on my steak, I finally had it! Katie came over and asked if we wanted boxes and I told her that I had to have my steak cooked longer and just got it. She didn't apologize for not checking on us or anything... then she proceeded to leave and play with a baby at another table? Again, I had to ask the manager to refill our waters. I think Katie checked on us maybe twice the entire time we were there! Some of the worst service I've ever had.   I definitely WILL NOT be returning!",

    "text": "I came here with a friend for her birthday earlier this year. It was my first visit to a Texas Roadhouse in a while, as I'm the first to admit that I'm not enough of a carnivore to be a regular at this particular chain. (I don't avoid it by any means, I just don't frequent it, either.)   For my dinner I ordered a BBQ chicken combo with ribs, which was a decent choice. The ribs are the primary reason I'm leaning toward \"ok\" on the food. They were tender and enjoyable enough, but I had hoped for a little more flavor in them, as ribs are a rare treat for me. The chicken ended up being the more memorable part of the combo, as it was perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning and sauce - very tasty.  As for the service, our waitress left a great impression. She was attentive, and she happily put in for a replacement steak when my friend's medium rare order came out well done. A replacement was brought to us by a manager who wanted to make sure the meal as a whole was satisfactory, so clearly the staff were paying attention to their restaurant that night. It was nice to see that given the number of other complaints on Yelp about incorrectly cooked orders.  Based on the food and service during my visit, Texas Roadhouse is a solid 3.5 in my book. The service was definitely good. Admittedly some of my food was more on the \"meh\" side; but considering how affordable this place is for the amount of food that I got, the combo was still a good deal overall. (Since the combo came with a couple sides of my choice as well, I ultimately boxed up about half of the meat for later.) I would definitely consider returning if the right mood struck me - particularly since I know they'd fit into my budget more easily than other steakhouses and BBQ establishments.",

I've never had a bad steak here and my wife & I have made it a point to eat here at least every other week.  Reading other reviews- I can't comment on anything other than their steak, and their steak is DELICIOUS.    The servers are always nice & friendly and try to be as accommodating as possible.  My one issue is that sometimes the entrees come out way too fast- like when we're only half way finished with the appetizer and we still have our full salads in front of us!  The server told us that it was because the kitchen basically runs the 'meal service' and when it's ready- they gotta get it out to the customers.  Our next visit we will order each item ourselves, and take our chances with how long it takes the kitchen to get it out.    Keep up the great food, TR!",

So here's what I like: - It's large, with lots of tables, so you don't have to wait long for a table. - The peanuts are fun. - My kids like it, and they have good kids meals. - It's a good value.  Here's what could be better: - The steaks are inconsistent and some times kind of low quality. - The rest of the menu is okay, but nothing special (e.g., salads, sides, etc.). - While servers are usually friendly, it gets very slow sometimes.",

While we were waiting we were surrounded by little moth like bugs.  Not sure what the deal is but not good.  My steak was a little tough and a tad overcooked but OK.  My baked potato came in some foil and was OK but overly steamed from being in the foil to long.",

    "text": "The best kept secret in Bridgeville! I was hungry and decided to eat here before the Beyonce concert. Maybe I take TX Roadhouse for granted being from Texas, but this place reminds me of home! They also have $2, 18 oz Margaritas (frozen or on the rocks) on Tuesdays! You can get an extra shot of tequila for ~2 bucks! And we are talking the big drinks! I just came from Miami and these size margaritas were $25. Come here at least for that!   Kids night is Sundays and Mondays, 99 cent kids meals (amazing deal)! If you're a family of 4 eating before 6 pm with 2 kids meals, your meal could literally be 25 bucks! Friday night also has $5 long islands. I'll be back for that.  I sat at the bar for an early lunch/late dinner, and met an awesome bartender by the name of Mercedes. She was Super sweet and extra attentive to everyone!  I ordered the 6 oz sirloin, medium rare with a sweet potato loaded and chilis I also got a side of bread and that sweet cinnamon butter. My meal was $12.82 with a margarita. Hello!?!?? No mistake here. I'm excited about this! I will DEFINITELY be back, much sooner than later.   This place is so ridiculously priced it's CRAZY! Perfect for anyone on a budget. And the food is good! I'm in love!!!",
