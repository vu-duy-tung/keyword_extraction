We were so glad we did! The pizza and cheese fries are amazing and we love that they use the smaller pepperonis on their pizza. They're always prompt when they deliver and we have never been disappointed with the food or service!",

    "text": "I've had a hard time finding a slice of pizza that doesn't dissolve under the weight of its own cheese and grease since moving to Pittsburgh but I finally lucked out with the white pizza from Napoli Pizzeria in Squirrel Hill. The crust isn't too thick but is crisp enough to keep its shape and toppings, the blend of olive oil, garlic and spices makes me forget about red sauce entirely, and even though it's perfectly delicious with just a cheese topping, nearly any of the other 20 topping choices would make for a great meal, too. The only thing that would make it better is if goat cheese was on the menu.   I wouldn't recommend eating in, though. The dining area is cramped and loud and the counter set-up makes it difficult to get to. Besides, this is one of the few pizza places in Squirrel Hill that will actually deliver--so embrace your inner laziness and eat it on the couch.",

I love how thin the crust is and how cheesy the pizza is and how mild the sauce is. It's not too acidic or too sweet. It's JUST RIGHT. Also I may be a little biased as I love wet pizza and lots of cheese. :D The closest thing I can get to this place in STL is The Good Pie. And it's more traditional Neapolitan pizza than Napoli's is.... but damn, Napoli's is like a Neapolitan pizza had sex with a normal NY style pizza and then YUM sprang forth. Yeah, I love this place, that's probably an understatement. I also love the fact that you can get beer from the case behind you with your pizza...because PA is such a booze-Nazi state. :x",

The roll came with a side of sauce and was quite tasty, well, where there was pepperoni it was tasty. I had a couple bites that was only dough(-1). The slice was also good, a nice thin slice with thinly sliced pepperoni that curls when cooked. As I was sitting down the Owner pulled a sausage pie from the oven, mmmm ground hot sausage(+1). HELLO! So, I had one of those, too. And it was yummy, too. I had a great conversation with the owner and another customer that came in after me.

When I walked in there were several EMTs by the door, so I figured the food would be good.  What EMT would go to a bad pizza place?    At the entrance to the left is the counter with some of the pies waiting to be heated back up in the oven and to the right several coolers with drinks in bottles from beer to soda.  I ordered two slices of pepperoni, which came out pretty quickly.    The staff was friendly and the pizza had just about the right ratio of crust to cheese to sauce.  It was greasy, but not too greasy (read just the way I like it).  On a cold day, it was the perfect hot thing for lunch and wasn't too pricey either.",

    "text": "My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Competing against the two other anchoring pizza joints on Murray Ave, Napoli's by far wins. They provide a richer cheese and more of it on top of an actual doughy and crispy crust. Both of Napoli's competition fall short with too much grease and a plastic tasting crust, where it can be replicated with frozen pizza.    In contrast, Napoli's Pizza provides an authentic red or white pizza with generous toppings from crispy pepperoni, rich bacon, hearty mushrooms, juicy spinach, to spicy banana peppers.  Aesthetically, Napoli's is a pizza joint with the same green booths one would expect to find in a \"little Italy,\" creating a small, friendly and cozy familiarity between the pizza makers and customers. At lunch, this place is packed with customers buying pizza by the slice, ordering fried zucchini, and munching on toasted hoagies.   If you're not up for sitting-in, delivery is always a quick and available option. The pizza is always delivered pipping hot and fast.",

If I'm in the mood I will grab a slice of pizza. I love that they sell slices and you don't have to get a whole pie. I've had plain, Hawaiian, mushroom and several others. They do not disappoint.  Seating is limited inside and it looks like what you would expect from a pizza shop. We typically call ahead to order and I pick it up. Parking is a complete pain in squirrel hill so I park at the bank across the road and run in to the pizza shop. I have never had to wait on my order- usually ready in 20 minutes. One thing to note- they do not deliver to Regent Square during rush hour. Im surprised anyone does though. Driving down Forbes at 5pm is the worst!!!  Anyways, get a hoagie here..they are awesome!",

The staff was super nice when I walked in the door, and there were plenty of different slice toppings to choose from.  I ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of white with tomatoes and spinach ($4.39 w tax).  The cheese slice was quite good, with plenty of yummy cheese.  The crust was an average thickness, but this is not a floppy slice of pizza.  It was really easy to eat with my hands.  I didn't care for the white slice, as I like more garlic and found their to be too much oil.  That is a personal preference, though.  While they do deliver, the owners were saying that it is really hard to keep up with all the business they get.  But they do deliver beer, which probably is fairly popular.  All in all, a good slice of pizza.",

    "text": "A friend and I ordered takeout from Napoli this evening around 6pm.  My friend lives right around the corner on Beacon St. and is a frequent customer of Napoli.  Given that I'd tried competitors Aiello's and Mineo's, I was curious to try this unsung hero of the SqHill pizza wars to see how it stacks up.  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza with a side of ranch dressing plus two bottles of Red Ribbon soda, which came to $22.50.  Upon trying the pizza, I'd rate it above Mineo's and equal to or slightly below Aiello's in terms of quality.  It had a medium weight crust that was neither super thick or paper thin and was crispy (I'm a sucker for a crispy crust).  The sauce was bolder and more flavorful than Mineo's, and was generously portioned.  There was also a decent amount of cheese, and the pepperonis were curled up, containing miniature pools of grease (grease averse pizza eaters beware).  One slight annoyance was the tendency of the toppings to slide off of the pizza--every slice I took had this issue.  The ranch dressing was alright but nothing particularly special; however, it made for a nice accompaniment to the crust.  When my friend called in our order, it took about 20 min. to prepare, so be sure to allow ample time if you're picking up.  Seating is quite limited--it's clear that they do most of their business via take out and delivery.  Also, they only accept cash, so be sure to bring enough to pay for your order.  Overall, a decent pizza--not the best I've had in PGH, but not the worst, either.",

The driver got there and I asked him, what is the delivery charge and do they add in a tip?  He says, no and no.  I didn't want to stiff the driver, so I gave him a few dollars for the tip, eventhough it took them 48 minutes to get here and I am right in Squirrell Hill.  That's in the same area, basically right around the corner.  The pizza had some cheese that was missing and some was sliding off of the pizza.  uggghhh, that's my pet peeve!  I am seriously not ordering from these people ever again.",

    "text": "Good pizza, but RUDE. I ordered three slices of plain to go and they had an attitude for no reason. Being within the same block as two of their biggest competition, I found it a little shocking. The first display of rudeness happened when I ordered and I asked about the sign outside. It said they were hiring all positions, and asked if that included delivery drivers because I knew a guy friend who was looking to deliver food. When I asked, they rolled their eyes and made it clear they were not hiring drivers who were girls. I told them that I was not interested myself but actually inquiring for a friend but they kept joking sarcastically at my expense and made me feel really uncomfortable. It made the pizza eating experience afterward really unenjoyable and I will never return.",
