    "text": "As I passed this place I contemplated going in but upon looking up the reviews had cold feet as they weren't overly flattering. Nonetheless I convinced myself to give it a shot. I was greeted by the hostess and taken to the back, but I then requested sitting by the window and she obliged. I ordered the spicy california rolls with jalepeno flavor and, I think, sweet eel sauce (the online menu didn't have what I ordered). In any case, I found the sushi to be extremely tasty and close to the best I've had. I then ordered the moshi ice cream, which appeared to be dumpling stuffed with ice cream. It was very unusual if not over the top good but I did enjoy it. The bill was a mere $10. I feel for the quality food I had and for how it was just enough to fill me up and leave me satisfied, all at a very reasonable price, the experience merits a solid 5 star rating.",

I'm sure the dressing had a mayonnaise base, which is fine, but I wish the taste of ginger was stronger. Our miso soup was warm, not hot. The sushi rolls were not very good at all. The sushi was alright, and while some of the sashimi was delicious, the rest of it was mediocre. I hate to leave such a harsh critique, because the people working there seemed very nice, but based on the food alone, I will not be going back.",

I ordered take out one rainy night, she told me 20 minutes and when I showed up, they acted like I had never called but my order slip was on the counter. I waited while they made my order.   I decided to give them another shot last Friday and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. We got there and were seated promptly. We rbought a bottle of wine which had a corking fee of $15. I was surprised, but since they had a full bar I understood. It took 20 minutes to get us wine glasses and then another 20 before our server took our order. Our server apologized for the delay because they were hosting a large group upstairs. I let it slide then. We got ordered and waited 45 minutes for our food and our orders were wrong. It took us approximately 10 minutes to eat since we were so hungry. We then waited another 35 minutes for our check.   Overall, the menu is great. I enjoyed my food, but it was not good enough to tolerate that service again. You'll see me at Little Tokyo next time.",

My 4 star review rides solely on the back of this magical little treat. It's basically a fried piece of heaven, like forserious. They're so good, they were probably made by Jesus himself.   On the outside, it looks like any other spring roll, but once you bite in, a journey begins: you go through four flavor stages by eating the SSR. FIRST, a crispy little exterior mixed with the delicious sweet sauce they come with. Second, a mix of perfectly cooked rice and veggies. Next, the sushi comes to play. Finally, like Captain Planet, the ingredients all combine to form a super-tasty-happy-time-Asian flavorgasm. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Sushi Too is by no means the best sushi restaurant in town but they are pretty good and also--my favorite place for maki rolls.  Whats good about this restaurant is they have options other than sushi in case you're craving maki and your dining companion doesnt want sushi.  The sushi here is solid.  It's not the best, but its good.  Here's the trick:  You can order take out from them (I use <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrubhub.com&s=c077f445c0f58c01f902dcc624c9eabb729cc1501e9105e88f0c900f5943d1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">grubhub.com</a>) and this is the way to go.  Dining in the maki are somewhat sloppy for some reason, and the service can be brusque due to what I'm assuming are language barriers.  If you get take out, your maki will look perfect for some reason, and the food always arrives quickly and as ordered.  I dont like dining here due to the over powering smell of fish in this restaurant.  If they have their front door open you can smell it across the Walnut Street.  Many sushi restaurants smell slightly of fish--you're eating sushi!  This place has ALWAYS just totally smelled like fish.  Its a good place for a casual lunch or dinner if you dine in, I would not bring a date here.  The restaurant is cute inside.  My favorite menu items are the spicy tofu salad, age tofu, edamame, the Negihamachi roll, Spicy Caifornia Rolls, Shadyside Roll, the Sunshine roll, and any of the tempura rolls.  Their miso soup is also very good.  I recommend this place for take out.  This review is all over the place, but they get 4 stars from me bc I am a long time patron, and I just love their maki rolls so much.",

    "text": "I orderee takeout, the Miso Soup and spicy tuna roll. When I walked in I was charmed by its dated interior nestled into the high end shops on Shadyside's Walnut Street. It's a hole in the wall vibe that draws you in.   This was the first time I've had Miso soup so I'm not in much of a position to rate it, but I think it's a typical recipe, Wakame, tofu, scallions, and topped w mushrooms. My taste buds felt like it should've been saltier. The spicy tuna roll was on par with most maki rolls, the caviar mixed with the spicy tuna was a nice surprise.",

Every time we called to check the status they said \"it's on the way\" and we're extremely rude, vague, and unhelpful (this place is 1.2 miles from where we ordered).   All of that aside, when the food arrived, it was terrible. It smelled like rotten trash and other people with us kept asking what the horrible smell is. I'm not sure if it was because it was made 2 hours ago or what but it was gross. We gave it a try regardless and we're not satisfied and ended up throwing it away (even the 6 other people we were with didn't want it).  Haven't been here and I don't know if this was an off night but I won't be trying it again.",

    "text": "I have heard about Sushi Too and seen it several times on Walnut St, but I never stopped in until a few days ago. My boyfriend and I were really craving sushi, and this seemed like a good spot to go.   The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, which was nice. Unfortunately, I was freezing to death the entire time because I was directly under the AC vents. That made it a little uncomfortable, but I dealt with it.  The staff here was unbelievably kind. The ladies serving us were nice, not pushy and somewhat attentive. I feel like refills could have been given more frequently, but oh well.   I am a vegetarian, so I ordered cold sesame noodles and a vegetable tempura roll with zucchini. My boyfriend ordered a vegetable tempura roll with asparagus, and a sunshine roll.   The sesame noodles were absolutely delicious, but I would have liked less peanut sauce. It was a bit salty, and there was a lot of excess. Something about it made my stomach a little irritated, but it still tasted good enough to finish. I'll have to ask for the peanut sauce on the side next time so that I can adjust it to my preferences. My vegetable roll was really good. I'm a huge zucchini fan, so the slight crispiness of the tempura batter and the softness of the zucchini made me happy. I put spicy mayo on top to add a little kick. I could have easily eaten these all day and night. One roll is surprisingly filling, though! And for only $5.   I can't judge the fish roll my boyfriend ordered, but he said it was average compared to the sushi he has had near beaches.   I'll definitely be back to Sushi Too, but I may not eat inside. The atmosphere is bland, and it's really a small space. I would rather get it to go and eat at the park or something. The price is reasonable, and the service is great.",

    "text": "The first time I came to Sushi Too, I ordered some rolls. They were terrible.  Months later, I decided to give it another try by ordering some real sushi -- the chirashizushi (also known as the chirashi don), which is only available on the physical menu in the restaurant and not on the online menus. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. It was actually pretty good. It consisted of a good variety of fish, including (if I remember correctly) lean tuna, fatty tuna, farmed Atlantic salmon, octopus, snapper. While these pieces of sashimi are not particularly outstanding, they are not too bad for a budget sushi restaurant (unlike the unfresh stuff found in certain other Pittsburgh sushi restaurants). The egg and the crab sticks were welcome additions too.  I'd give it four stars for the quality of the chirashi, but then numerous fruit flies and sticky stains on the tables warrant the subtraction of another star.",

It's not the most fresh sushi or the best deal, but when you're too lazy to eat out or drive to Ginza, it perfectly satisfies your craving. They have a pretty large menu but I generally stick to the sushi entrees, so I can't speak to any of their hot foods. I usually stay with the basics-- tuna and hamachi rolls, shashimi and nigiri. I don't really like the spicy tuna because it's mashed up fish rather than sliced tuna, and I generally avoid the more creative rolls because the sauces are too much. The sushi combos such as the royal platter ($24) are the best deal because it comes with soup, salad, rice and multiple rolls or shashimi/nigiri. It's enough for me to spit into two meals.",

I didn't really want to risk ruining dinner by complaining about the light-pink color of the tuna (should be deep, pleasing red) but an hour or so later when we were both puking I wish I would have mentioned it :( I called the next morning just to let them know that for the sake of business they should throw out their tuna, I wasn't asking for a refund or anything--I used to work at a sushi restaurant so I understand that it happens in small establishments sometimes, and I felt bad that others who may not be so kind might get sick and raise a racket. Unfortunately the management seemed to interpret my courtesy call as an attack and assured me that next time I came in I would get money off etc etc and didn't seem concerned about what i had to say about the food that made us sick.

I really enjoyed the roll since it combined rice, avocado, and shrimp tempura, always a winning combo, and all three were done well.

I've been to phenomenal 5 star places in Miami and California, and also great hole in the wall places. I'm easy to please I think. Heck, I enjoy Giant Eagle Sushi.   I wish I would have gone to Giant Eagle.  I came for a quick lunch, sat at the sushi bar and ordered the sashimi lunch special. Came with salad and soup. Perhaps I should have ordered a roll?  The sushi bar area had an unpleasant order. But I held my nose and stayed. The soup and salad were completely mediocre, but not bad. Well the soup was OK. Salad was limp with excessive dressing.   The sashimi was just not good. The tuna was tough. And several of the other pieces just had a mushy texture and no good flavor. I partially blame myself for even getting so sashimi. A sushi roll would've been a much safer bet. The quality of the fish is less apparent in that setting.  The service, was pleasant and quick. I got in and out very quickly. The price was also very reasonable for a sushi lunch. I spent only $10. So if you do decide to come to this place, try a lunch special for the price, and do not get sashimi. Try a funky roll. Maybe that will be good.",

    "text": "As a general rule, I love sushi, so as a sushi lover, Sushi Too is a huge disappointment. The selection was not great, the service was slow and the fish was not good. There was dust all over the ledge of the booth (it is like a ledge for decorations next to the table) and the bathroom was filthy and doubles as storage for high chairs and other miscellaneous items. Cleanliness is an issue here, which is a big deal for restaurants in general, but especially so for a sushi spot.  The food was not gross and spoiled rotten, but was not fresh and had an odd taste, like it was low quality. I honestly considered leaving a few bites of sashimi on my plate, which is very unlike me. The sesame salad dressing was very good and I liked the miso soup. I did not get sick after eating at Sushi Too, but I will not be returning. My boyfriend felt the same way as me and did not finish his meal, stating that it tasted odd.",

    "text": "Visiting Sushi Too was truly refreshing. As a recent transplant to Pittsburgh, I've had issues finding decent sushi that isn't over priced. Sushi Too delivered in an unexpected and pleasant way. I give Sushi Too 4/5 stars for the following reasons:  Atmosphere: 5/5 Sushi Too offers the feeling of a cozy yet high-end sushi restaurant. Features such as custom high quality napkins, high quality chop sticks and a relaxed atmosphere, help make you feel very comfortable here. Though this place may be a bit small, the feeling is just right!  Service: 4/5 The service here is quite nice. Everyone seems happy and was constantly smiling. The only complaint I have was the waiting time for our meal, due to one sushi chef serving the entire dining area. I feel this is more of a timing issue though, as we visited between the lunch and dinner rush.  Food: 4/5 Biting in to my sushi rolls truly was the best part of my visit here. The food was prepared excellently, with large portions for their sides. I've had many tempura rolls but the Asparagus veggie tempura roll was extremely delicious (and cheap!). The only reason I did not give Sushi Too a 5/5 in this category was due to their limited selections. I am a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and felt that there were a lot of classic rolls that simply weren't there. Don't let this discourage you though, their selection still provides some great options for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I recommend checking out their special rolls of the day.  Price: 5/5 I was pleased to get out of a sushi restaurant for under $25, for two people. The price was right here, without any price gouging that I've seen in other places around the 'Burgh. In short, Sushi Too will not be breaking the bank.  Overall: 4/5 Sushi Too is an establishment that successfully blends delicious food, atmosphere, and service. I was very happy with my visit and will definitely return to further explore their menu.",

It's literally just made up of what you would normally find in sushi (rice, salmon, avocado, and spicy mayo if you want) but in the form of cupcakes. It's called cupcake sushi because it looks like a cupcake. The order comes with two cupcakes. Definitely give it a try.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4",

Vegetable fresh rolls and vegetable stuffed tofu pockets contained fresh crispy vegetables. The dipping sauce for the fresh rolls was delicious.

    "text": "This sushi place is to die for!  My parents were in town for thanksgiving; and it was Black Friday. I was craving sushi, but my normal sushi go to place was closed unfortunately. So I scoured the internet for another option that would satisfy all of us; and came up with this.  At first glance, it was a whole in the wall dive that looked questionable both from the outside and the inside. Yet, remember that saying to not judge a book by its cover? That applies here. Don't judge the restaurant by its cover; judge it by its food.  We ordered way to much food; but all of it was delicious. As a family who grew up going to dim sum restaurants and Chinatown in DC and Rockville MD growing up, this brought up back to our time spent together when I was a child. That being said, when our table was covered in food plates, it would have been nice to have a heads up when we ordered that we had ordered a LOT.  My only other criticism would be that for my bento nigiri box, when i asked for just salmon and tuna vs a mixture of fish, they uncharged me $2. I feel that with the multiple items we ordered, and the amount of money we spent, that should be waived.",

    "text": "Man. I guess I should've taken this place's 3 stars more seriously.   When I pay for a specialty type roll, well in my entire life any sushi rolls, even the simple maki, have ALWAYS had either 6 or 8 pieces per roll. The one I ordered tonight was just FOUR little pieces! Like they took a roll and cut it in half and just serve the half roll.. sooo strange, I've never seen this before.   Also my roll was supposed to have smoked salmon in it. Which was the whole reason why I ordered that roll. Instead of smoked salmon it contained like some kind of baked salmon...   The roll my husband ordered was fine, and the rest of my roll after I picked out the salmon was okay I guess.. not very visually appealing, usually the eel is covered in sauce, this one isn't really at all and doesn't seem very high quality. Also the shrimp tempura in the other roll was greasier than any other shrimp tempura roll I've ever had.  I guess I'm lucky that when I ordered I added a note saying \"please nothing spicy and no mayo\" just in case, cause thankfully mine didn't get mayo but my husband's roll automatically came with that mayo sauce even though there was no mention of it on the menu. I hate when they don't mention things like that on the menu.   Sushi isn't cheap you know, for what I paid I'm soo disappointed by what I got. Oh and one thing of chopsticks. Never seen a place be so stingy, usually any place will give you like three things of chopsticks minimum.... not Sushi Too, nope. Neverrr going back, could neverrr recommend to anyone. I finally learned my lesson and will never pay with cash again, only card from now on so I can get a friggin refund next time this happens.",

    "text": "Food-wise, I would say this is one of the better sushi places in Pittsburgh. Fish is fairly fresh, and they have a decent variety to choose from. Portions are decent to large (depending on your appetite), and their alcohol and non-sushi selection is good as well. Overall, I would give them a 4 or 5 star for the food.  As for their service, they could definitely use some improvement. When we dined in (they let us use their large table and room upstairs for our large party), the host pointed for us to go upstairs and sit at the table. Since no one else was actually upstairs, we sat ourselves down and didn't think much of it. A few minutes later, a waitress comes up to serve us, and starts yelling at us to take our shoes off immediately (apparently, we weren't supposed to wear shoes into that room, but no one had told us beforehand). It wouldn't have been an issue otherwise, had she not been as agitated as she was. I'm happy to take off my shoes, but please don't yell at me like I'm a disobedient child! She also refused to step into the room when giving food to us (presumably due to her shoes), so when we were receiving dishes, she would ask the people closest to the door to pass the plates to everyone else. Not a big deal, but when you have a large party like we did, it started to get annoying because those people near the door would be constantly interrupted while they were eating, to pass dishes to everyone else. Other than that though, she wasn't overly rude or anything, but just be aware if you plan to dine there, don't expect five star service.",

The salmon is still always fresh as used to be.   For lunch: I do recommend a set from the lunch menu which makes your meal big and cheap.  In the night: NORMALLY they serve EDAMAME as a courtesy and I never saw any restaurant in Pittsburgh that does that.   For dessert: I like their fried ice cream (also called Tempura Ice Cream).

    "text": "The way I gauge a sushi place is by ordering my favorite go-to item: Chirashi. It's supposed to be a bowl of sushi rice (meaning seasoned vinegared rice) with an assortment of scattered toppings including fish. The reason I do this is multi-fold: 1) it gives me an idea of what their sushi rice is like (which is what sushi actually is -- the vinegared rice); 2) I get to taste the ingredients separately; 3) I get some variety when I'm feeling indecisive.    Based on what I received this place clearly failed. I should have been suspicious when I saw the kitschy items like \"sushi doughnuts\" but I figured it can't be that hard to make good sushi rice and have some fish and other items. And it definitely wasn't because I ordered delivery.   Now, the fish wasn't bad. Its texture and smell were fine. (Side note: I have to laugh about all the folks on yelp being like \"ugh you can't have fresh sushi in a place like PGH\" when the FDA guidelines state that any fish besides tuna has to be frozen to be free of parasites. But I digress). They were definitely smaller than I'd seen before, but for the price I'm not shocked. I was very disappointed there was no roe, no seaweed salad, no veggies. But this isn't even the biggest sin of this order... no...  Not only was the sushi rice warm (and completely unseasoned save for maybe a quick dash of some sesame)... the toppings were served separate. Maybe, just maybe it was an off night and the poor soul left to make my order didn't know what the heck chirashi was. I get they didn't want my fish to get warmed up in transport. But that's the thing -- the rice isn't supposed to be hot. Basically it looked like someone threw some rice into a container then assembled a weak-sauced sashimi platter.   Maybe if you're looking for some of those monstrosities that are deep fried and covered in sauce this might be the place for you. And  won't lie, sometimes I indulge in such things myself. And I can at least say the fish is acceptable. But if you're going for more simple and/or traditional fare, this isn't for you.",

For the Pork Shogayaki, the worst ever! pork Shogayaki is a very common Japanese dish, and suppose to be made with thin-cut sliced pork, but Sushi Too has sliced but very thick pork Shogayaki; it's dry and tasted like chewy gums! It's nothing like Japanese style at all.  And the seafood yaki udon noodle, took forever to make, and when the waiter delivered the food, we found that it's been cool down...maybe they forgot we ordered that?

    "text": "Sushi Too is an excellent sushi place, but it is also affordable. The service is quick because for some reason no one is ever eating in there! Why?? I can't understand it! The food is great; the prices are good; the service is fast; plus, it is on Walnut street. I cannot believe this place isn't packed at all hours.   On one particular visit I ordered the shrimp sushi and one of the variations of their Oh My God roll. Everything was fresh (very important when it comes to sushi, duh) and the textures working together in the Oh My God roll were complementary  -- crispy shrimp tempura, perfectly cooked rice, creamy top. Very very good overall.  Their lunch specials are also legit, so I recommend visiting for lunch. You get a lot of food for a very small amount of money.",

    "text": "After a nice workout my friend and I decided to grab some food in Shadyside. I have not been to Sushi Too in a really long time and had an appointment on Walnut at 8:30 so it kinda worked out perfectly. When you walked in you were greeted warmly and led right to a table. It was not packed in the restaurant but it had more people inside than I expected for a Monday at seven. The waitress came over and asked about drinks but I opted just for water, if I just worked out I better try to be a little bit healthy throughout my meal.   While looking at the menu I was particularly interested in the fact that they had lunch boxes. I think that a little bento lunch box at a reasonable price is really the way to go for a quick and easy take-out lunch. I put that in the back of my head as maybe lunch spot for later.   I was interested in the sushi donuts on the menu. But I think it was more for the idea of me ordering a sushi donut not for anything else more than that. I think that it was just sushi in the shape of a donut. The prices weren't bad, around $9-15 dollars per donut, but it just was not what I was looking for and I would have wanted to share it not really get it for myself, it looked a little much.   It was a colder day so I opted for the wonton soup to warm myself before we picked out our meals. I will say that this is where they started to lose me. I am a sucker for wonton soup. I order it at almost every place that has it looking for my favor broth and wonton combo. The broth here was not good at all. It, to me, tasted like salt. I mean that honestly, deer in the woods licking a salt lick, salt. That is the very image that popped into my head as I was trying to enjoy the soup. It was hard to get through and I had to drink a lot of water that night. The wontons were ok. I would say that they had a nice stuffing of chicken and seafood and the meat consistency and flavor was good. But the broth.... I do not think that I could make myself drink that or even go through that again.   My friend then for her before dinner snack ordered the vegetable gyoza. I had one of the little dumplings and they were pretty good. I have never had a strictly vegetable gyoza so this was an experience. It still tasted good as any semi fried/steamed dumpling would and the dipping sauce made it extra delightful. I would order this again, especially if there were any meat issues within the group that I was with.   For my main course I ordered the house special roll \"dragon roll\". It is my go to for all sushi. I love eel and avocado. It was wrapped perfectly and had a nice smokey eel taste to it. A perfect amount of wasbi was put on the plate. I would ask for my ginger for the next time, but overall the presentation and the taste was very good. I would get this again because it tasted fresh and it was a tight roll that didn't give way when dipped in soy sauce. Yum.  I also ordered on the side the two piece of sashimi that was just two pieces of tuna over a rice roll. I got this to go for my partner to eat but then he already ate so I took it to lunch the next morning. YUM! What a nice filling little lunch treat. It stayed fresh and tasted very good. So if you have to keep your sashimi on hold for a bit, just know it will stay good for just a day.  I liked it here. I would like more opportunity to explore the menu, but I can say that it was A-Ok in my book. Try it out, maybe you will like it too.",

DO NOT RESERVE A ROOM FOR A PARTY UPSTAIRS. We did that and our waitress told us if we needed service go down stairs and track them down if we needed them. So don't expect any service for the high prices you pay. The lowered tables and legless chairs upstairs, looked kinda cool and fun initially, but not comfortable at all. DO NOT BYOB. $15 corking charge which they tell you about when you get the bill. Also DO NOT GO THERE WITH A LARGE PARTY. 20% automatic mandatory tip for large parties which you also find out about when you get your bill. Hefty tip to pay for very little service along with subpar food. Nice Location on Walnut, but AVOID if you don't like overpaying for poor service and food. They more interested in emptying your wallet than serving you good food.",

Cons: - The spicy chicken was not particularly spicy, and was actually pretty bland. - Egg rolls are not very good.  I would skip them the next time I order. - They offer asparagus rolls at their location at CMU, but not on the online menu, which specifically asks you not to make substitutions.  The campus sushi place is closed until fall semester, which means I have to go without asparagus rolls all summer.  The entrees don't seem too great, and I can't speak to the fish, but if you're a vegetarian and like sushi, then I can definitely recommend Sushi Too.",

However, the ebi (prawn) sushi was notable in its toughness. Very disappointing.  - The age tofu was simply not agedashi tofu. It was tofu puffs in a sweet-salty, General Tso's thick sauce. Not authentic by any stretch of the imagination, and furthermore not even tasty. Gross.  In summary, go for the cooked rolls like Joey F. said. Go somewhere else for the other stuff.",

And what really upset me is that they store their highchairs in the women's room, as well!!! Toilets and highchairs just... ugh!!! I understand that restaurant restrooms are not perfect, but if you can't clean the restroom on a daily basis, I certainly question the cleanliness of the kitchen preparation area and food storage area. In addition to the filthy restroom, the server served the table of 6, but forgot all about one of the customer's meals. This was the person who suggested eating here in the first place, and was the one with the headache because they were really hungry - this same person has been here several times before and had an incorrect meal given to him on his last visit - poor luck?!?!?

    "text": "The \"Sushi Too\" refers to Pan-Asian menu which includes Chinese, Japanese, and Korean food. So far I have only tried the sushi rolls. While their sushi quality is mediocre, their cooked rolls (broiled fish, tempura, etc.) are some of the best I've had anywhere. Very savory and saucy. This past time was strange as their specials menu consisted of a laminated page of photographs, with no description. I tossed it aside as it wasn't helpful at all, yet when the waitress came by she prominently mentioned it and talked about a few of them. I couldn't remember her earlier description, so I asked to confirm what was in one of the rolls, but she had trouble remembering (luckily the part I remembered was what she forgot and vice versa). I ordered that and another roll, but she forgot the second one. The first turned out to be very good but pricier than I expected. It was also quite filling so it worked out alright that the second one was forgotten.",

I just made a delivery order (for the 3rd time since i moved to Pittsburgh in November) and then was called an HOUR after I made the order and told that my order will not be delivered due to the fact that they do not feel safe driving in my neighborhood. I live in East Liberty, a 5 min drive from Shady Side. The part that I am confused about is that they have delivered to me multiple times before, in this neighborhood and now are refusing to.   If they didn't feel comfortable delivering to me I would have understood if they called 5 min after the order to inform me but they called an HOUR after the order was placed. On top of it they told me to come pick up the food, but would not offer any sort of compensation!   HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!",

The sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while.  I'm not being a snob.  I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices.  As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh.  Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland.  On the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content!  So here's to my health.",

    "text": "I was really anxious to try a sushi place in Shady Side, so when I walked passed this place, I decided to try it! The ambiance just wasn't there- the inside was small, cramped and you could hear other people's conversations around you as though they were sitting right next to you. It was distracting how busy and loud it was, especially because our booth was confined to such a small area. It did not seem very clean and almost smelled like floor cleaner. The bathrooms were tiny, cramped and you had to wait in the hall/through way for servers if someone was already in there. So, basically if you like the mood/setting of a restaurant, this isn't going to be your first choice. They did have a large shark figure on the wall, which is fun if you like sharks like me! That was the only part of the restaurant's interior that I liked. The miso soup was absolutely wonderful, as well as the ginger salad. It was one of the best ginger salads I have had in a long time. I ordered a California roll, which seemed to be a bit dry and nothing spectacular, mediocre at best. I also decided to be adventurous and order the Christmas roll I think it was called. There were giant salmon eggs on top of it, which gave it a really fishy taste. The server was very sweet and suggested I get this roll, though, I had no clue what I would be getting myself into by ordering this! If you are adventurous and like to try different rolls, this would be perfect for you. If it did not have the fish eggs, I think this roll would have been perfect for me. My thoughts on the roll is not a reflection of the restaurant as much as just my personal taste. I ordered the chicken satay appetizer, which was pretty good- tempura like battered chicken with a dipping sauce. Was the food decent? Yes. Would I go back? Probably not. The food is worth a try but don't go in there with the same expectations I did, you will be unpleasantly surprised!",

    "text": "Rolled into da 'burgh for the weekend to watch the Phillies/Pirates games.  My wife and I used to live in Pittsburgh and had originally made reservations at Umi, but on the day of ended up eating a large late lunch and decided to cancel.  But as the night wore on we grew hungry again and were stuck in Shadyside.  It was getting tough to find a place that was open, let alone had an available table, until we stumbled upon Sushi Too.  I had always been curious about this place, but because the menu seemed boring and over-priced, I had never tried.  A bit of circumstance changed all that.  The restaurant is decorated in a somewhat cliched sushi joint manner (you know it when you see it), albeit with far less chotchkies than many other places.  You can sit and be comfortable without being distracted by a myriad of junk that makes you wonder \"What the hell is that doing there\"?  Our hostess and server were both very nice, despite the fact that we popped in pretty late in the evening when it seemed the dinner service was winding down.  Sushi Too has its liquor license so you can order a limited selection of beers - including the obligatory Sapporo and Asahi varieties.    For a starter I had seaweed salad and it was as good as anywhere else I've had it.  For dinner I ordered sashimi - sake, hamachi and hirame (salmon, yellowtail, fluke).  They were presented as three nice looking cuts each, with each cut being slightly larger than average.  The quality of the fish was very good - good flavors and textures.    Overall it was a good experience and worth the money.  If a future visit yielded similar results - I would bump my rating to 4 stars.  Consider it a 3.5 for now.",

    "text": "Came here on a Wednesday evening for some sushi with the girls!  I had just exercised and was looking forward to a nice, light meal.  The place was a little busy - not full, but several tables occupied - but we were seated immediately.  Atmosphere and service both were functional but not personal, nothing special there - except the hammerhead shark that hangs above the sushi bar.  I got the Rainbow Roll and an Eel Roll, with soup and salad first.  Miso is $2, so is house salad.  I prefer it when that comes complementary, but I decided to pay for it since it just feels wrong for me to have sushi without.  Miso was good, hot and filled with tofu.  The house salad was about two or three times larger than it usually is, and the dressing was a little heavier than I like it.  I was a little bummed since I started feeling full of salad before my sushi even arrived!    The rainbow roll was small.  Usually I have rainbow rolls with about 8-10 pieces (I think?) but this one only had 6.  It was also about the same size as the eel roll (standard 6 pieces).  I don't think the rainbow roll was a good deal for the price.  All the sushi was okay, it didn't taste uber-fresh but it wasn't bad either.  Not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  It was well-made, but the presentation completely lacked any flair.  It's a pretty inexpensive place to grab a few rolls, which is nice.  I paid $20 for soup (2), salad (2), one specialty roll (10?!?!), and one regular roll (6).  Rainbow roll was NOT worth $10, so I'd say stick with the simple rolls that make more sense with the price.  It satisfied a craving, but I've had way better sushi elsewhere.",

We ordered a bunch of stuff, including 5-6 rolls, an appetizer, entree and a side dish.

    "text": "I decided to look up Sushi Too on Yelp to see the reviews. It only has an average 3/5 stars?! A TRAVESTY.  First let me preface this by stating I have been eating at this fine dining establishment, oh, since I was about age 12 or so. I am now 22 years old and I live in St. Louis, MO for college. But I am from the 'Burgh, and let me say, it was at Sushi Too that I consumed my first ever roll of sushi. Yes. And that was the start of a beautiful and long-lasting relationship. Raw fish? Ew. That's what my 12 year old self thought. And  then I put a california roll in my mouth. Chewed. Paused. Swallowed. MAGICAL!  Enough about my snooze-fest of a childhood. On with the review.  As I stated above, I have been going here for years. Not every trip has been 100% perfect, but c'mon now, people. It's a restaurant. It's going to have good nights and bad nights. Slow nights and fast nights. All of that jazz. Maybe I am just lucky and have always had the good fortune of having excellent service?  I just ate here recently...about a week ago during my return to Pgh for Thanksgiving Break. I noticed they are remodeling the front of the place AND the menu has changed quite a bit. Almost  for the worst, I think. It seems as though they are starting to try to appeal more to the \"mainstream\" sushi crowd. As in the  folks who love the flying magical rainbow dragon tiger crawdiddly daddy rolls. Tuna rolls? Out. Yellowtail rolls? Out. Hell, even a Cali Roll is getting too \"boring\" by today's standards even though it is technically a fusion roll. (Called Cali Roll for a reason, it was a roll concocted on the West Coast, not Japan.)  Next thing you know, they'll be phasing out the spider rolls in favor of something that has 15 different ingredients in it and comes deep fried with dipping sauce. (There is actually a restaurant that serves this in STL....look up \"The Drunken Fish\" in my other reviews.)  But I digress....!   Sushi Too is affordable, IMHO, compared to say...Chaya in Squirrel Hill. Not only is it affordable but the fish is very fresh and good for the price. I have always ordered more traditional rolls here, like for instance the tuna rolls, yellow tail rolls, eel nigiri, ikura nigiri (salmon roe), and occasional sea urchin roe which is my all time fave. Not saying fusion is bad, folks. Their Alaska roll (salmon, avocado, and flying fish roe) is insanely good too, but I didn't see that on the menu last I went there but I bet you could still ask for it. Also the \"Oh My God Roll with Eel\" is superb! It has shrimp tempura on the inside, deliciously warm melt-in-your-mouth saltwater eel on the outside. Seriously, it does melt in your mouth.  Another good thing about Sushi Too is the appetizers. Pork gyoza (dumplings). Scallion pancakes. Edamame. Miso soup. There are entrees and appetizers w/o raw fish if you don't like it! Their food that isn't sushi is actually pretty authentic when it comes to Japanese food.  Their lunch specials are DELICIOUS and AFFORDABLE.   Also their hot green tea is the best in town, hands down. It's also better than any sushi restaurants in St. Louis. I swear!  Don't be put off by low ratings on this site, just go out and try it for yourself. If you go back there enough, they will even bring you edamame on the house--my family and I having been eating at Sushi Too for years--so I've been offered free appetizers a few times now. :D Maybe it was dumb luck, a messed up order, or maybe they truly care about bringing customers back, especially repeat customers!  PS: Did you know, they are also owned by the same people who own China Palace a few doors down? So if you like Chinese food better but you still want a sushi fix, go to China Palace and you can order sushi from Sushi Too. It's pretty damn awesome. :)",
