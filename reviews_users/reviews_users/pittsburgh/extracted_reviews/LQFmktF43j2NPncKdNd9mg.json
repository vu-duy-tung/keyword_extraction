    "text": "I've loved Fat Heads for a long time. So long in fact that my name is forever engraved on one of the signs in the bar (a dual effort with the BF in drinking far too many delicious brews). This is finally the declaration of my affection.   When people ask me where they 'must go' in Pittsburgh, Fat Heads is always in my top 2. It is hands down the definition of Pittsburgh food, next to the other in my top 2, oh-glorious-one Primanti's. Portions are HUGE, and I've never had anything I did not like. Go with a Headwich, wings, or a salad. And start with a soft pretzel. The house-made honey mustard that comes for dipping is what dreams are made of.   They also brew their own beer, and have been doing quite successfully at national competitions. The HeadHunter IPA has won a ton of awards. They're super cool about giving you a couple samples to see what you like - so don't be intimidated and do something stupid like order a Miller Light, or I am totally going to shoot you the stinky eye from down the bar. They also carry Arsenal Ciders now, and more than 40 other great craft draft selections on a rotating basis.   I can honestly say when I left Pittsburgh for a couple years (sinner, I know), the first place I hit when I came back was always Fat Heads. And it always will be.",

Even though it was packed, service at the bar was quick and friendly (say hi to Apple!). 35-40mins later we finally got our table. We ordered the Mo Betta Beef Headwhich (O-M-G so tasty! so full meat! nom nom nom), 20 garlic parm wings (very parm-y, large wings - so if you're eating these as an app for 1, get the smallest amount), perogies (they were good but I like pan-fried better....these tasted like phyllo wrappings), and hot peppers (also very good! and very spicy). We shared everything so we can get a taste of different things on their menu. Table service was fast & efficient. No problems at all at this place. I'd def come back here for the Mo Betta Beef again!  Then if you have some room left in you; you can go upstairs to their \"beer store\" which consists of many types of beers that you can mix & match. If you get a 6-pack, you get $12 off the total price. Plus if you ate at the restaurant I think you get another 5-10% off. Seriously.  (I love America!)",

The steak salad is covered in cheese smothered steak, with secret layers of fries and peppers and mushrooms and cucumbers...it was like I was digging for buried treasure.  Another plate may have been in order, but I didn't ask.  Needless to say, it was VERY good.    This wasn't the first time I had been here so...  Other memorable food items: the fried mushrooms are a huge huge pile of fried goodness.  The wings are good - not the best ever (but I am a bit picky) - but I'd put them top 25% of my favorite wings.  The only strange thing I remember is that the nachos are prepared with their homemade potato chips, NOT tortilla chips.  Maybe you're into that, but I was disappointed and sad.    The chicken parmesan soup is really good, as is the french onion.  Their burgers are juicy and wonderful. My husband always gets some crazy sandwich with egg, and while I tend to like my eggs for breakfast, he always seems to enjoy them.  I'm not looking at a menu now, but I recall something along the lines of something called Southside Slopes that my husband really really loved.

Splitting the Headwich was definitely the way to go, we got the Beer Camp Part Deux which was sauerkraut, keilbasa, cheese and peorogies piled onto a roll the size of my head.  We knew what were getting into though with the headwich and it was awesome.  The mountain of bacon cheese fries that came out though was a little bit intimidating.  At at first with cold cheese sauce on it which was a bust, but when they brought it back the bacon was sizzling and the cheese sauce was steamy.  Luckily we had some help of friends who stopped in, but still barely made a dent.  Good times, easy,  consistent, nice service.",

Anyway, everything was delicious, and the beasty sauce on the sandwich was spicier than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise.  The sandwich came with their chips, which you can tell are homemade.  I thought the chips needed some salt, but once I added a bit they became fantastic.

Also great for sporting events (as are most places in Pittsburgh) but Fat Heads tends to get a bit crowded with a long wait.  Their beer prices can be a bit pricey for Pittsburgh as well.  Of course their wings are up to Pittsburgh standards and would recommend trying their plethora of flavours.  The Southside Slope Headwich is a must try, however be warned you may need some help finishing this massive sandwich that could feed a family.  My personal favourite is the Beefed Up sandwich.  The combination of the banana peppers and the swiss cheese are a pleasant mix.",

Sport on the TV.  Yeah, it's good. What's that, four different varieties of \"buffalo chicken\" sandwiches? Gigantic deli meat sandwiches with all manners of pork products and names like the \"artery clogger\"? Humorous in-jokes throughout the menu? Chips? Fries? Only thirteen different kinds of wings? GOSH!  Really, it very well could be worthy of five stars if it weren't for the persistent firesh**s that come with the territory. Oh well, it's still worth it in the end.",

My bf got the killer wings, and to him they tasted like regular buffalo wings... the heat wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I ordered the veggie sub, which was good. I just didn't like french fries on my sub, it was more mind over matter. It made me feel like a fat heffer. My sub needed some better seasoning - add Goya seasoning por favor! I did like my pierogies, which I've ordered from here before. My bf got the cheese steak and on a scale of :( 1-10 =) he gave it an 8. My friend has always gotten the Aloha Chicken and she's never ordered anything else.   It's a good place if you're about to get your period, or if you're just in the mood to gain 10lbs in one sitting. The beer was really good too!",

    "text": "A family visit to Fatheads Saloon...  We arrived and were greeted and seated promptly, and our waitress was prompt to greet us and get our drinks to the table. While the restaurant atmosphere is kid friendly, there is no kids menu. My kids are old enough to share and enjoy something off the kids menu, but for kids under 5 this may be an issue. Our service was great, our poor waitress had to check back with us at least 3 times before we were ready to order because there are so many choices it's really difficult to decide.  What we ate:  Order of fries: there was a good mix of crunchy, perfectly done and a little soggy for every fry preference, and the basket has tons of fries.  Order of chicken tenders: we ordered these for the kids to share. They were fine, nothing to write home about but glad they had them for the kiddos.  Plain cheeseburger: one of my kids is super picky, so a plain burger was all he wanted. The party was super thick and it looked like it would be an amazing base for one of their fancy burgers from the menu back page.  Bay of Pigs: hubby says it was yummy, with a touch of spicy. There was pulled pork, ham and pickles it was stacked high and he really enjoyed it.  Bovine Devine: I honestly don't even really know what was stacked on this huge sandwich, but it was delicious. I could've used a smidge more sauce, but it was delicious nonetheless.  Chips come with the sandwiches and they are homemade yumminess.  We also enjoyed 2 glasses each of beer, Headhunter for hubby and Bumbleberry for me. We both thought the drinks were delicious, and loved that we were able to grab a cold 4 pack for the road.",

We arrived right around 11 when they opened, and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was helpful and friendly. They have a  mix of their own brews as well as a variety of guest taps. I had the bumble berry (blueberry and honey) and I really enjoyed it!   For lunch, I ordered the divine swine, which was a pulled pork sandwich which came with bacon on it, and a side of chips. The portions were HUGE. The sandwich was a bit saucy for me, but they chips seemed freshly cooked, and were pretty good!  At this location, you can take growlers or cans to go, which you can order from your server, or purchase from the gift shop upstairs. If you bring your receipt with a meal purchase, you can save 10% off apparel. Unfortunately, the variety of cans  to go was quite limited when we visited.  Parking can be tricky as this is downtown. We parked on the street, not knowing that there was a paid parking lot directly across the street. I would recommend using that!",

On the other hand, the food is just mediocre and I feel like the service is really slow and the wait is so long, which combined warrants a three-star review.  So, I'm going with a four-star review here, but I'm not overly confident in my rating for once.   They are known for their wings and headwiches.   I've sampled quite a few of the appetizers and they are all good bar food but nothing to write home about.   For good beer and a Pittsburgh experience, I recommend using the no wait app and swinging by but if you are looking for out of this world food, I wouldn't brave the line.",

While I understand that mistakes happen I was a tad disappointed with the fact that not one member of management came over to see if we were ok or if we needed anything. It was -15 degrees on Saturday and my pants were completed soaked...I felt like I peed my pants. There was no compensation for the incredible inconvenience. Everyone enjoyed their food.

    "text": "There's a reason why there's always a wait for this joint. Even though I came here on a Tuesday evening, still had to wait a good 15 minutes before my group was seated. The service was quick though so no complaint there.  As for food, I ordered the house burger with bacon and sriracha thousand-island sauce. It came with a mountain-size side of crispy fries. The burger itself was beautifully large as well. I was only able to finish half of my burger and took the other half for lunch the next day. The burger was cooked to my liking and the sauce added a slight kick. I wish they gave me more sauce though, but the burger was moist enough that it wasn't a problem.   Overall, I love Fat Heads! The portion size is HUGE so definitely worth the price. The burgers are top notch and the service quick. I highly recommend this place!",

Generally friendly waitstaff as well, and very reasonably priced.  I ended up splitting a pierogi burger for an entree, and it was more than enough food.   They have a long list of house made beers as well as those brought in from outside.  Many of the house beers are priced at around $6 per, which is more expensive than other Southside purveyors, but in also of a higher standard (house made pils vs. miller light?  I know which I'd prefer at a few dollars premium).  tl;dr: Go.  And you'll probably want to go again.",

Next time, I look forward to trying a headwich (sandwich), although I will have to be really hungry because they are enormous!  The atmosphere is fun, and it wasn't filled to the brim with college students, as least when we were here. There seemed to be a variety of people, even some families, which I thought was nice. We came at 3pm on a Saturday, and we maybe waited 5 minutes.  We were seated in a big booth, and I was immediately overwhelmed by the sheer size and length of the menu. Everything looked amazing! We had the spinach dip, and it was delicious. I had the bone dry Arsenal cider, which is my absolute favorite cider (I buy it by the growler at Arsenal), and then switched to the Arsenal sour cherry, which you can't find in restaurants and bars as easily as the more common bone dry and Fighting Elleck. Love the sour cherry! It's very sour on the first drink, and then smooths out from there. The alcohol content is pretty high for a cider, so be forewarned!  I can't wait to come back for a headwich and more cider. Great selection of beers on tap as well.",

They took most of it home.    We started with some spicy wings. Wings were good with just some nice spicy heat.  Then on to the challenge of eating a Headwich that come with some tasty homemade chips (just add a little salt).  The Long LIve The King was so tasty with the stuffed banana pepper, very good sausage, mozzarella cheese , grilled tomato, onion, garlic mayo and anchovy.  Hard to describe but delicious.  Some very interesting flavors that combined well.  Did not meet the challenge.  Had to take some home for a nice treat the next day!  Great beer selection, too.",

The beer selection is a selling point.   We had a wait that wasn't quite as long as expected. While waiting, we went to the bar to get drinks. The bartender I interacted with was unpleasant. I ordered a beer that was on their wall (one of the Fat Head beers) and the bartender informed me that they didn't have it and seemed annoyed. I then asked if they had a beer like the one I had chosen and he said \"No.\" then carded me. After digging out my ID (I'm 25, so no issue there), I asked if there was a stout on tap. He then flung a paper menu, different from their wall menu to me, and immediately turned around and walked away. In every other bar I've been to, bartenders, no matter how busy, have made at minimum a small effort to help customers select a drink they would like...or at least not flung a menu at me. To top matters off, there were 3 beers on the menu that contained exactly what the original beer I ordered had as main flavors.   He was very unpleasant, and in a city with so many bars and restaurants, I'll be choosing to spend my time/money elsewhere in the future, even though the rest of the restaurant experience was tolerable.",

The service is decent-- I've never had a particularly great or particularly horrific experience at the bar or at a table. The food is extremely salty and heavy on the cheap carbohydrates (bread, chips, etc.), but is good if you are just looking for some bar food. I like the pierogies. The women's restroom needs a renovation and some repairs, but the rest of the restaurant, including the patio, are well kept and clean.

Order a burger and you'll get one as big as a fat head!  My buddy ordered an appetizer of mushrooms and he tasted them for days!  My other buddy ordered a salad that would probably count as a week's worth of food.  All their plates are in giant portions and filled well above the rim.

I had the Jack-O Headwich, which was excellent.  I barely finished it, didn't even touch the chips that came with it since I was so full.  Wanted to try a beer, but I was just too full to drink one.  These guys know beer, and they have the best selection.  For two people sharing an appetizer and walking out stuffed, the bill was $36 without tip.  Not bad considering our appetizer became lunch the next day.  Just a great place with a great environment.",

    "text": "Fat Head's Southside Slopes sandwich made an appearance in the in-room touristy magazine at the Marriott, and the ad was effective as hell-- once you lay eyes upon this animal, you know right away that your life will be incomplete without trying one. It seemed as though every beer advocate in town congregates here, and with good reason... despite the huge crowd, the tap list is an all star roster of fine brew at decent prices. The Southside Slopes was the star of the show, however. It's a beast of a sandwich with cheese and grilled onions atop pierogies and kielbasa. It starts out very good, with the kielbasa dominating each bite. It gets even better as time passes, with the cheese and pierogies melting into a creamy potato concoction that wonderfully complements the sausagey overtones. Trying to finish might make you uncomfortably overstuffed, but that doesn't make each step of the attempt any less of a religious experience. If you're in Pittsburgh, it's a must-do.",

My party really enjoyed their chicken wings, I believe they just ordered original. The perogies were also tasty; tender pockets of potato-y goodness.I had the veggie sub with grilled green peppers, onions and black olives, prov cheese and french fries. Definitely was my first time having fries on a sandwich. It tasted like a cheesesteak sans the meat, pretty good. The sandwiches are HUGE though and come with either fries or potato chips. You'd be best off sharing one of these bad boys. The soups were good, as was the soft pretzel and one of the chicken sandwiches. My aunt did not enjoy the Tuna Steak sandwich so I guess avoid that. Service was relatively slow and was the biggest negative for this place. We waited quite a while for our food to come out while other tables were being served. We also did not get as much attention as I would have liked from our waitress, we were a large crowd of 7.",

    "text": "I really like this place, sure it's busy and you'll have to wait for a table but it's totally worth it.  I first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known, but they've always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.  I was here yesterday with a larger group of friends and we had a blast.  We didn't have a reservation and there was about 8 of us, so the wait was about 45 minutes.  Great excuse to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.  We ordered some fries with bacon and cheese and also some fried mushrooms as appetizers, greasy goodness!!  The server was really good, she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different delicious beers.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and then had a beer with us after her shift was over.  The wings are a must have when you visit.  My favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wings which are delicious.  They are baked and then grilled, so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you... relatively...  The garlic parm wings are also great and I suggest you definitely try these as well.  I also ordered the steak and egg \"headwich\" which is  definitely as big as my head.  It was enough for three of us to share along with the wings.  And, to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers, wings, steaks, and eggs weren't enough we also tried one of the desserts (cheesecake) which was a little better than average.  Overall, this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh'.  It's a must visit when you are in the city.",

I have found that the crowds have gotten larger and larger over time, to the point that it's not that enjoyable anymore.  I'm all for having a few beers while waiting for a table to become available, but it ends up that you are crammed in the bar area for 2 hours, and you end up having too much to drink before you eat.  In the event that you DO get a seat in a reasonable time period, try the South Side Slopes Headwich: Kielbasa and Pierogies on a sandwich can't be beat.",

The French fries have a delicious seasoning on them and the portions were great.  Fat Heads is known for their beer after all. They offer a long list of seasonal and year round brews that you can order in flights or by the glass. The Fat Heads hop juju and Hefeweizen were so tasty.   If you love variety you will love fat heads. The menu and beer list are diverse enough to satisfy just about everyone and with most entrees priced under 12.50, it won't break the bank.",

While not a sports bar, there are plenty of TVs to catch the Pittsburgh games.  The bar area is a little on the smaller side so it can sometimes be hard to get a seat.  There is also an outdoor area which is nice.  As I said, this place is known for their sandwiches some of which are rather original.  I suggest you check out the menu if you think you might come here.  Most recently, I had the salmon Reuben.  I really like this one.  Good sauerkraut.  Good salmon.  Good times.  I had a cup of French Onion soup to start.  This never disappoints.  While the food is great for bar food, Fat Heads also has their own line of beers.  I like the Headhuter IPA.  The bar has 30+ drafts from various micro-brews.  The beer selection is really great.  This place is located on Pittsburgh's South Side which is a long strip of bars and restaurants.  Be warned that it can get crazy on the weekend nights as it college folks descend on Carson Street for the many beer specials.  I would recommend coming on a weekday unless you are under 25!",

Get the bumbleberry or you can get a flight for about ten bux. You get 5 picks for your flight and its not a dinky little shots its actually a decent portion.  I kind of didnt like my choices for food as much but I think they were still done pretty well.  Food- Voodoo Burger (House smoked pulled pork coated in our Killer sauce, Swiss, roasted red peppers, fresh sliced jalapenos and a drizzle of our ranch dressing): The pulled pork wasnt very tender. The burger itself was great though. Also didnt taste much of the killer sauce. Prob wouldnt get again.  Double D headwich: Definitely an interesting sandwich. Think of a cheesesteak and then add pepperonis and two large banana peppers stuffed with sausage. Its like an italian cheesesteak kinda. I prob wouldnt get this again just cause they have so many other options, but I def enjoyed the sandwich. Only complaint is the steak coulda been better but it was still pretty good.  Overall I enjoyed the menu selections they had here and ill def be back",

The smoked wings were delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad was different but also tasted good, we got it with steak, and the steak was tender.

    "text": "Hoping to go somewhere new after my graduation, I sent the family a list of places.  With a bunch of picky eaters and one person with Celiac's, Fat Heads fit the bill.  The menu is huge, and anyone can find something to eat here.  While we were driving over, I tried to get a spot with No Wait, but since we were a party of 5 (\"Large party\"), that was not allowed.  This was a bit disappointing, but we ended up only having a five minute wait when we were quoted 30 minutes.  It could have been so much worse.  We arrived at 3:00 PM on a Saturday so this may not be the place to go with a big group.  I ordered the Bumble Berry Honey Blueberry Ale ($6) to drink, and it was one of the best beers I have ever ordered.  I really only drink ciders, fruit beer, and liquor so I had some concern ordering a beer at all.  But this beer smelled delicious, didn't have an after taste, and was outright amazing.  It was so refreshing and great.  For my meal, I had the Southside Slopes headwich ($12), which was kielbasa, pierogies, cheese, and horseradish.  The kielbasa was great, and the pierogies were an awesome addition.  The sandwich was so heavy with a beer so I only ate half.  It also came with a huge side of chips.  The portions here are gargantuan.  Splitting with a friend may always be the best option.  The service was friendly and quick, and the atmosphere is very bar/saloon-y.  There is no smoking, which is a lovely thing.  This is a fun place to try local beers with some unique food options.",

    "text": "Fat Heads is one of those places that I would love to frequent if frequenting didn't require a 7 hour plus drive. For my son's recent graduation, I allowed him to pick from the plethora of elegant and eclectic restaurants in and around Pittsburgh and, without any hesitation, he picked here. And, as I quickly learned, with very good reason. Food, while casual, was delicious, well priced and served in mass quantities. Even my appetizer portion of cod & chips was way more than I was able to finish.   As far as beer goes, their menu is huge offering an unmatched variety of both local and exotic crafts which, to my delight, included a grape beer which I though was awesome. In interest of full disclosure, however, my company thought it tasted like Manischewitz with bubbles. Okay, so it kind of did but what the hell's wrong with that? Service was also polite, friendly and attentive. Crowd was mostly mixed with a healthy serving of hipsters complete with requisite tight bottom skinny jeans and man buns. Nothing wrong with that, however.  I guess I penned this just to add my 2 cents but in reality, it's really not necessary. The other 500+ excellent reviews speak more about this place than my few paragraphs can. If anyone of my local NJ friends are ever in Pittsburgh and looking for a friendly, cool and laid back place, might I respectfully suggest Fat heads. I think you'll be glad you did. And if you're a local, I have a sneaking suspicion that you're already well aware of it. Stay thirsty, my friends.",

    "text": "I've been to the Fat Heads in North Olmstead, Ohio, but it was sadly two years ago... remembering that there was one in Pittsburgh on my night I spent there, I went -- obviously... that's why I'm typing up a review, right?  For a Monday night at something like 10:30pm, it was surprisingly busy. The Pirates' game had just finished up, but even still, I was a bit shocked. The building has one of the better sports bar vibes I've seen, and I really liked it. It's not a very large dining space, but it's not exactly cozy either.  My girlfriend and I decided to get the buffalo cauliflower appetizer ... this was before I forgot to remind myself and her that the portions here (or, at least in North Olmstead) are absolutely insane. The buffalo cauliflower was, how shall I say... boomin'. The cauliflower are flash fried and not breaded, which I wasn't expecting, but they were awesome. The buffalo sauce is tasty with a surprisingly hefty heat, and the bleu cheese on the side was incredible. I love me some chunky bleu cheese.  The hipster cheesesteak I ordered wasn't as delicious as the Cuyahoga burger I had at the Ohio location, but it was still great -- loaded with thin slices of steak, some sausage, a little cheese, a hefty amount of broccoli rabe, and a bit of cherry pepper mayo. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't help but feel like I either needed some more cheese or seasoning on the steak.  Service was great, food was really good, and the beer is some of the better stuff you'll have (the Bourbon Barrel Aged Battle Axe was fantastic), assuming you enjoy craft beer. There are a ton of dining options in Pittsburgh, but you'll be hard-pressed to find one that will fill you up quite as much as Fat Heads.",

Everything they do here they do well. So many options too. They have a spinach artichoke chicken dip which is AMAZING and served with fresh pitas. However all of their sandwiches are so large an appetizer definitely is not necessary (yet almost impossible to pass up).  I typically get the Buffalo chicken sandwich which has celery on it! The crunch withe the chicken and spicy buffalo sauce all goes together so perfectly.  Not to mention they have so many amazing beer options. The headhunter IPA is one of my favorite beers around. The atmosphere is lively and typically around dinner there is a wait, so get here early! If there is a wait.. grab a beer and wait it out. You will not be disappointed.",

I got a little nervous since I didn't want to have food envy but felt confident about my selection.   And confident I was. Placed in front of me was one of the most beautiful sandwiches I've ever seen along with a heaping pile of potato chips. It was so on.....I said hello to my sandwich and took a picture of it for the memories because I was sure it would be gone very soon. So Tiffany vs. Food was on but unfortunately Tiffany failed. The leftovers were just as orgasmic as they were in the restaurant. When we left it was around 1:30P and they was a wait going on with a line out the door so be sure to go there early if you go on the weekend.",

    "text": "This review addresses only the wings, as I did not have any other food or drink.  I came on a Tuesday night for the wing deal. Cost is now 60 cents per wing, and you cannot order the Char-broiled varieties. You can, however, order any number of any flavor (not restricted to 5 or 10 etc per flavor) so you do get the bonus of trying lots of flavors.  I tried the garlic-parm, smoky barbecue, cajun ranch, sweet sour, spicy parm, jalapeno cheddar, and killer flavors. The only ones worth eating again were smoky bbq, cajun ranch, and sweet/sour. The cheese-based ones were soggy and cheese was gunky. The killer - yes it was hot - but tasted gross. Like really really gross, I suppose from the vinegar component.  The wings come out fast enough. That's to their credit. However you can tell the wings are frozen and mass-cooked. The size is not particularly large (compared to Quaker or Library) and the meat not tender, though not burned. The flavors though are just squeeze-pumped on it seems as opposed to specifically addressed. A glaze sauce can't be prepped the same as a wet sauce as a dry rub.  So I guess if you're looking for 2-3 wings of lots of flavors, this is good. But I usually like to eat 40-50 wings. Tonight I stopped at 25 because I was already paying $18 and the flavors weren't particularly exciting. I won't be back for the Monday wing \"special\" with better options out there.  Jason's rank order list of Pittsburgh Wings (updated occasionally): - (tie) Quaker Steak (Robinson) - buffet tuesdays - (tie) The Library (Carson) - buffet tuesdays and sundays - Quaker Steak (Pleasant Hills) - buffet tuesdays - Fat Head's (Carson) - 60c Mondays",

This is your place.   * Are you a carnivoire and just need to sink your teeth into some flesh? You've found a new home.   * Are you sick and tired of menus that lists the calories and crave a 4000 calorie meal? Welcome to Fat Heads Saloon!   And yes the sandwiches are as big as your head. They are almost beyond belief. To make matters worse, or better, they are served with a mountain of homemade excellent potato chips. Be warned:these platters are so big that if you are by yourself, you would be out of your mind to order an appetizer.   You could have a \"normal\" sandwich here but that would be criminal. The giant gourmet sandwiches are called \"Headwiches\" and they are the stars of the show.   I attacked the Expert Pastrimi. It was Pastrimi grilled together with hot sausage and onions and topped with a fried egg, sharpI cheddar cheese , pickle and hot pepper mayo. Are you kidding me! This incredible creation was beyond fabulous. Wash it down with an excellent craft beer and you have one hell of a meal. By the way, these monster sandwiches go for about ten bucks and are worth every penny.   Part of the fun here is watching the faces of other diners as the waitstaff brings out these bad boys! I travel a great deal and have eaten in hundreds of places. These folks are a five star gastro pub experience!",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 6 for my birthday dinner a few Fridays ago. The staff accommodated us and we only had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which really wasn't too bad considering we did not have a reservation and it was a busy Friday evening. The one and only issue I had with eating here was the noise level of the restaurant. My friends and I practically had to scream at one another to be able to talk, but I will forgive this as my food experience far outweighed my slight annoyance with the noise. I had never been here before, but after hearing all the hype, I had pretty high food expectations going in and I was NOT disappointed! Fat Heads is my favorite kind of \"cheat day\" food - giant cheesy sandwiches, fried goodies, giant portions and awesome beer. It was everything I wanted it to be and more. For apps we had a solid selection of buffalo cauliflower, pulled pork cheese fries, nachos, fried pickles and pierogies. Everything was AMAZING and the pickles had an incredible spicy dipping sauce. For dinner, I went with the \"Jack-O\" steak sandwich and it was also incredibly good with a side of their homemade potato chips - everything was SO DARN GOOD and needless to say we took tons of leftovers home and rolled out of there barely able to walk. Guaranteed you will not leave here hungry. Definitely will be back, and totally worth a trip! Fat Heads, thank you for living up to my sandwich expectations!",

I remember before a Aesop Rock concert once at The REX me and by buddy Ryan went here and just ordered a huge plate of those with just cheese and bacon, filling.   I forget the name of the beer but it's like 10 percent alcohol, get that.  It's a little expensive but well worth the visit.  One of my favorite Pittsburgh places to eat.",

I'm surprised we don't have one of these in Texas b/c the food is surely BIGGER & BETTER here.  I went with a couple people and we ordered some original wings for an appetizer and DAMN were they good. The wings were seasoned well, then tossed in a moderately hot wing sauce which had an amazingly unique and delicious flavor to it.  I ordered the Chick'n Little Headwich and even with all of the hype around the size of the sandwich, I still had a shocked look on my face when our waiter brought it to the table. The contents of this sandwich read like an Artery Clogger list: Chicken Fingers w/ Wing Sauce, 2 Fried Eggs, Ham, Bacon, Cheese etc. I know, it sounds a bit ridiculous but I guarantee you won't feel that way once you've taken that first bite. Although this one meaty treat probably shaved 6 months off my life, I think it may have been worth it b/c it exceeded all of my expectations and I had set the bar pretty high.  I love that this place is also a brewery and from the couple of beers I tried, a pretty good one at that. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd be a regular here so at least drop in for a bite and a brew and find out if you think its as awesome as I do.",

I have been coming here pretty frequently for the last 14 or 15 years and it's always a great experience..... They have the best chicken wings in the world, a fantastic beer selection, and just a cool atmosphere in general. There is nothing pretentious about it - they know that they are serving food that isn't very healthy, and they don't apologize for it. You go there for chicken wings and fries and enormous sandwiches and beer. It's not a place for health freaks. But it's a place to get some great food, Pittsburgh style.   The original chicken wing sauce is outstanding. They also just added smoked wings to the menu. They are pretty awesome, particularly with the Carolina sauce. And they changed up the menu a bit. Some new sandwiches and such. Still a great place, even with the new menu.",

Over the past six weeks there was a DRASTIC change to their menu.  At least two pages of the menu were deleted.  Prices raised and even some popular headwiches were removed.  They are also very strict about fries vs. chips.  This is not a cheap restaurant if you want a beer either!  Miller Lite pint is 4.50, which is double what is charged next door at the bar.  Depending on when you arrive at peak time is how long you wait.  They have opened up a significant amount of seating over the years.  While yes this is a South Side staple, I feel selling beer has moved to the forefront.  Wings are still amazing, and you won't be able to move after a headwich.  It's just a shame with some of the changes.",

I was disappointed when the salad came out, no longer in a bowl but a plate. Also, the lettuce was wilted and brown for the most part. There were only about five cherry tomatoes on the entire salad and not many other veggies. The best part of the salad was the brisket. Also, it appears that they are focusing more on their own beers as opposed to other selections, which is cool, gotta admire them for that. So, the food isn't as good as it used to be.

Looking @ the menu, I thought the prices might be high until I saw the portion sizes!  wow!!!    After enjoying those fresh cut fries and drinks, we headed up stairs to the retail shop.  Hubby bought a pint glass and T-shirt.  The sales guy was a sweetie, engaged us in conversation, very good at his job.  If you eat here, you get 10% off your purchase in the retail shop.    If I ever find myself back in Pittsburgh, I'll find myself back @ Fatheads.",

    "text": "Fat Head's has always been a staple of mine for beers since I became interested 'craft' beer years and years ago.  The restaurant itself has been transformed over the years.  It now offers a wider bar area, more indoor seating and now outdoor seating.  They have even started producing their own line of beer (brewed in Cleveland).    I personally like coming here for the beer.  The tap list is quite lengthy.  There are over 40 beers on tap continually.  The beers range in style, thought I typically see more IPA's on the menu.  They have IPA's, Pale Ales, Stouts, Imperial Stouts, Farmhouse Ales, Brown Ales, Pilsners, Hefeweizens, Red Ales, Lambics, Porters, Rye Ales...etc, you get the picture I hope.  They also have one beer on the hand pump.  Though many of the beers are Fat Head's brewed beers, they do have lots of other beers from breweries from within PA, the USA and around the world.  As a personal note, I really love the Head Hunter IPA and the Goggle Fogger Hefeweizen.  Despite the constant turn-over of taps, I find the tap lines to be clean and have never had a beer that tasted funny.  Most 16 ounce beers (the lower ABV ones) go for roughly $6.00.  Not extremely cheap.  The food menu is rather extensive.  They have tons of sandwiches, wings, salads, appetizers, burgers, chips, fries...etc.  The portions are enormous and there is always leftovers for me (which is shocking as I can put down some food).  If you have never seen their menu, it can be overwhelming.  It does change from time to time too.  I usually have good success with the food, though sometimes, it has not been great.  But that is not the norm.  The wings come in a variety of sauces too.  I really enjoy the wings and those are my go-to  My favorites are the char-grilled wings with Fat Head's Original Sauce or Beasty Barbecue.    Overall, if you are on the South Side, Fat Head's is a great stop.  It can get extremely crowded around dinner time and lunch time.  They do not take reservations, so wait times can be lengthy.  If you have some place to go after you eat , this may not be the place to choose.  The bar area is an option, but this area gets crowded as well.  The service behind the bar is always fast and efficient.  The bartenders see you, trust me they do and they will get to you quickly.  If you have questions, please ask them, they know their stuff.",

Boyfriend had the Southside Slopes which is amazing. I mean, with kielbasa, pierogies, onions and cheese, what's not to like?! I had the Mighty Fine Bovine and it was the bomb. The mix of brisket and pastrami is perfect. AND THE GARLIC PARM MAYOO! Man was that so good! The hot pepper kraut really added a nice bit of spice and crunch too. Pro tip: get a side of ranch to dip your chips in! Beer wise, they have so many on tap that if you can't find something you like, the problem is you. I almost always get one of their beers because #drinklocal.  Just some housekeeping things: there's a lot across the street and street parking all along Carson St. they recently remodeled the place and the downstairs didn't seem to have as much seating as before. But there are seats upstairs. I cannot recommend enough downloading the Nowait app and using it here. That thing is a lifesaver.",

    "text": "Fat Head's is a Pittsburgh institution, one I dont get to as much as I used to, and as it turns out they're under construction right now. For some reason they decided to cover 75% of the restaurant and bar in subway tile. Doesn't exactly scream \"Fat Head's\" to me, but oh well.  The star here to me is, and ways will be, the beer. I definitely don't come here to try another brewery, and stick to Fat Head's beer every time. The top choice being Hop JuJu when it's available, but I've rarely had a FH brew I didn't enjoy.  For the food, it's top of the notch bar food. I know some people enjoy huge portions, but can't say I do. However, I've adjusted my ordering here to accommodate. Personal favorites are the fried pickles which arrive in a basket with 2 sauces and basically 5lbs of pickles. And for the entree, smoked original wings, every time.  Now my MAJOR gripe: I hate nowait, I hate that Fat Head's uses it. We showed up right at the exact time listed with 1 table ahead of us, but when we checked in we were told we still have to wait. Why was that an issue? Half of the patio and restaurant were empty. I just couldn't fathom it (see photo).",

    "text": "Over the years my wife and I have come here on many occasions and we usually just stop by for drinks.  We have ordered food a few times but Fat Heads is one of our favorite bars to go to in the South Side to have some drinks.       On our most recent visit we stopped here after brunch from another restaurant.  We were still a little hungry but we just couldn't find anything that we really wanted to eat here.  The few other times that we have eaten here the food has been ok.   Now a days for us we would probably would only eat here if we were out late and needed some food.         I'm a wheat beer kind of guy and I love German beer.  One of my year round favorite beer is their Goggle Fogger Hefe Weizen.  It's a great summer beer but they have it on tap all year round and it taste just as good in the winter months.  My wife loves IPA's so she enjoys their Head Hunter but they always have a good amount of IPAs on tap that she likes to try as well.  No matter what type of beer that you like you will find something here on tap which makes this place so good.       Overall I think we usually get pretty good service here.  The first few times we came here we didn't particular care for a certain bartender but it's has gotten better over the last few years.  It is the South Side so during busy times it can be very hard to get a seat at the bar or in the restaurant.  That's why we like to come here on Sundays because it's usually not too busy so we can sit down and have a good time drinking our favorite beers at the bar.  Cheers!",

The menu is full of sandwiches, burgers, other bar-type food, and headwiches (sandwiches the size of your head). We both decided on burgers. I ordered the smoky burger and she ordered the gluten free triple bypass burger (and substituted the beasty BBQ sauce for the smoky BBQ sauce). Both burgers were juicy and flavorful, and the fries they were served with were solid. We were both pleasantly surprised by the gluten free bun. The portions were very generous. We couldn't finish and had to take the remains to go. Our waitress was friendly and the service wasn't too slow.  I'd definitely go back, but I'd probably have to prepare my stomach ahead of time. If you plan on going to Fat Head's (which you should), bring an appetite.",

It is always perfect and the high quality bread they use helps every sandwich hold up and stay together despite the heavy toppings.  The buffalo chicken sandwich is also one of the best I have ever had.  Make sure to get their homemade chips as a side.  On top of the sandwich options, they also have great appetizers including wings and the spinach and artichoke dip.    The atmosphere is fun, especially in the summer when the patio area is open.

Once we got our meal and I asked for more ranch I had to wait about another 10 mins just to get the ranch while he was getting water and dressings for other tables. He just seemed to pay a lot more attention to other tables and not mine. We are younger so that may be why, but it is not right. Once I got the extra ranch I asked for and we finished our meals we sat for 30 mins before he finally brought us the box and another 10 to get the check, although he acknowledged up multiple times and we told him we were finished up. He just kept us waiting a long time for everything and prioritized other tables. I hate tipping low, but I had to due to the blatant ignoring of my table.  Edit: he also took my boyfriends plate when I wanted to take his chips home. Thanks Adam now I can't enjoy Fatheads awesome chips as a snack later.",

I ordered takeout and got their jalepeno bacon burger with a veggie patty & no bacon. (Woman on the phone said that was from an old menu, but they made it happen anyway). I was pleased that they went off the menu for my order, and it was delicious. The sandwich was pretty spicy, but goat cheese really balanced out the heat. I also enjoy their buffalo cauliflower. Can't go wrong with that! This isn't the place for a light meal, so if you're looking to fall into a good coma, and have a nice beer selection, this is the place to go.",

We walked a few blocks checked out the stores and even got a piercing. When it came time to enjoy lunch it was a sad state of affairs! The bathroom was bad real bad smelled and only one toilet could flush. The bathroom was gross. The bathroom is located right next to the kitchen. I should have known better. We sat to order. My chair was sticky and wet. I ordered the Turkey cheese melt. The bread slices were very large but not toasted enough making the sandwich soggy inside. The chips were good served on the other side of the platter. Everything was big but not executed as planned. I was not willing to finish my sandwich because of the poor quality but my friends enjoyed their sandwiches. I guess the bathroom is a big thing if you can not clean it what about the kitchen? I am getting to the point why eat out anymore. Just eat things like wings and fries. If you want a good well executed meal do it yourself. Things have changed nobody cares anymore about service and customer comfort. That is what makes you come back again. The waitress was nice and suggested salad and i should of listened to her. Probably won't go back anymore. My husband use to take me to all these places and back then it was good.",

My friend was a little too tipsy to drive so we went next door to the tattoo parlor (bar + tattoo parlor= crazy drunken tattoo ideas!). I ended up getting not one, but two tattoos to waste some time for my friend to sober up. In reality, I wanted the tattoo that I got and had been planning it for a while, Fat Heads just helped move the timing of my tattoo up a bit. The timing worked out because by the time that I was done, my friend was all sobered up!",

The burger is to die for, and the horsey sauce tastes amazing on the fresh, crisp fries.  Minus one star because this is the only restaurant at which I have ever literally tipped nothing.  It was an isolated incident in which our server went MIA and we couldn't get anyone else to help us (with, for example, the fact that our order was wrong, or the fact that we needed to pay the bill).

I sent the nachos back and asked if we'd be getting the food soon -  the waitress impolitely let me know that \"appetizers come out before the food.\"  When I told her that they usually come out within fifteen minutes of ordering them she told me \"the kitchen is very busy with take-out orders.\"  Deciding to just wait it out, I'm starving at this point, we waited another half hour.  At this point we've been seated an hour and forty minutes.  We got up and decided to eat elsewhere as fat head's evidently doesn't have time for the patrons actually in the restaurant.",

For starters I have tried their fried pierogies which were good but not what I thought they would be. I was expecting an extra crispy pieorgy with soft filling, but they just were not as \"fried\" as I thought they would be. They were still delicious, but I wanted something more crispy.   The sandwiches, or \"headwiches\" as they are called there, I have tried are Jack-O, The Divine Swine, and PCI. I have also tried their Fiery Voodoo Killer Burger. All 4 where good in their own way, and also served with extra crispy fresh potato chips! Out of the 4 my favorite would have to be the Divine Swine. It was a good pulled pork sandwhich and the sauces they use are alright, not my favorite. Fiery Voodoo was extra spicey and I really couldn't finish it. I completely underestimated the spiciness of their killer sauce! PCI is a typical Italian sub. My least favorite was the Jack-O. I was expecting a more thinly sliced beef, but this was thicker cut and kind of hard to bite. I had to use my knife to cut it to eat it. It wasn't bad, just not my taste!  I have only drank here once and only tried their Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale. This was AMAZING. I am not a big drinker, so when I do drink I like fruity drinks or a lighter beer. This combined both of what I loved into a yummy refreshing beer. It is served with fresh blueberries in it, and I will for sure be getting this again! One of my favorite beers I have tried.  I will be back here whenever I crave a burger and beer! Always quick and friendly service and a great bar atmostphere. I love looking at all the pictures and nick naks on the wall, and find something new each time! Worth trying!",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Fat Head beers, I was very excited to try out the Fat Head Saloon. Unfortunately, the only thing that didn't disappoint was the beer itself.   The bar tending was standard, nothing exceptional about my experience at the bar, but then again, how hard is it to pour a 16 oz beer? The beer though...exceptional, as expected!!!!  However, let that be the end of your expectations for the night. If you want any sort of service, or if you want to feel like the restaurant wants you there, don't attend the Far Head Saloon. I was originally greeted with a frown when I said I would likely just drink at the bar, but when I decided to sit at the bar tables I was asked to stand up as our table was \"needed\". The table proceeded to be empty for another hour. Sam, the server, was not friendly, nor accommodating as she clearly talked about my group because I went to the front to ask a menu question and they told me not to sit at another table within the restaurant.   If you like Fat Head beers, definitely make a stop to get a good draft, but your experience at your local grocer will far exceed the service of this bar. This establishment truly needs a refresher course on customer service!",

I went for the concord grape cider which was light and refreshing! wish I could have tried their blueberry honey fruit beer! It sounds amazing!  For the food the special for Friday was fried pickles (surprise!). I love pickles so wanted to order this even if it wasn't the special. For my entree I got the cajun tuna taco press. My bf got the cubano sandwich.  We got our drinks and appetizer first. The fried pickle basket was a pretty big basket and I was really full just from this! These fried pickles tasted a bit better then other places where I've tried fried pickles. Seems their batter sticks to the pickles better and the pickles were sliced instead of the normal pickle spears other places served.   For my cajun tuna taco press, its pretty much a wrap and I enjoyed it as it was definitely on the lighter side of the menu and the spices on the tuna were on point. Nice flavorful spice and actual heat. Both my bf's entree and mine came with fresh made potato chips. There was a lot! If I'd known, I probably wouldn't have ordered the fried pickles. The homemade potato chips are really good though and I kept eating these even after I was full.  Great beer and great food to accompany the awesome drinks!",

Mother Flipping Sandwiches the size of your head, that's what. These things WILL clog your arteries so make sure you have a strong constitution.  The sandwiches are served with homemade chips (delicious) and a normal sized beer look puny in comparison.   I'll be honest though, if you can get around the fact that this stuff is really REALLY bad for you. It's delicious.  They come filled with sausages, fries, perogies, cheese galore and lots of meat.  My tip to you: Skip the bread, get your knife and fork and eat the middle of these things. You still won't make it anywhere near through all the filling but at least you're using the room in your stomach up on the good stuff.",

Some friends brought me to Fatheads and immediately I loved it. Very casual, down to eat spot. Family and kid friendly during the day.  The waitress didn't appear to have to many tables, and it took about 5 minutes for her to come over, address us and get us drinks. She walked away before we could order an appetizers, so we waited about another 5 minutes for her to come back.   Once everything was ordered and delivered all I have to say is YUM! I got medium wings - and they were delicious. Not the best wings I've ever had, they were a bit undercooked however they hit the spicy spot I was looking to kick.  I had a great experience here and I will be back in the future!",

    "text": "It seems I may be in the minority, but I wouldn't go out of my way for Fat Heads.  Perhaps I was in a bad mood because the only thing worse than Pittsburghers driving in snow is Pittsburghers parking in snow (and it was impossible to find somewhere to park on Saturday afternoon).  Perhaps it was the hour plus wait to get a table - 4/6 people in our group wanted Fat Heads, so I was forced to wait.  Hungry Angelica does not wait well.  I don't know, but something wasn't making this trip super-special for me.  Three of us got burgers.  While they were good, they weren't amazing.  I was getting full and wanted to finish the patty sans bun, which was a mistake.  My burger, the Renee, comes with cheese, cheese sauce (overkill), mushrooms, and bacon and you really need all of that cheese because the meat on mine was a little dry and had no flavor when eaten off the bun.  Another had the Nicole and noted that the fried onion straws were basically non-existent.  I've had that before and they pile it with onion straws; this time, there was only a sprinkling of chopped pieces (the leftovers perhaps).  A third person had a classic bacon cheeseburger with an egg and it was finished with great gusto.  Also ordered by others were wings, a steak sandwich, and a taco salad.  The wings were good and spicy, the steak sandwich wasn't commented on, and the taco salad was good, but just kind of there - nothing special.  Pros: extensive craft beer list with a cask on tap, huge menu (though it has direction - you know you're getting some good, classic bar food), wings, bar atmosphere. Cons: inconsistencies in the kitchen with preparation and presentation, some burgers not living up to the hype.  Will I come here again? Yes, but I'll order something different and it won't be during a busy afternoon rush.",

For food, my go to buffalo chicken sandwich tossed in the spicy parm sauce with a side of fries. I usually have leftovers for lunch too. Their wings are also delicious. The specialty headwich sandwiches are also great and huge! The only downside is that it can get super crowded and waits can go up to 2 hours for a table.

    "text": "I'm going to first say i've been going to Fat Heads for over 10 years and love the place for the most part. I normally go for their wings, though some of their sandwiches are pretty good too. I will say the quality of the wings can be a miss sometimes. The spicy parm particularly aren't consistent, but when they are done right, they are awesome. The wings are really only affordable on wing nights, but they are a bit pricey even on wing nights these days.  Now, I went here last night with a few people, and I will have to repeat what others have been saying recently. Immediately we noticed their menu is drastically different.  A full two sided page is missing from the menu. They have even less wing flavors (they didn't have many to begin with). The menu is actually even smaller if you pay attention, because there are actually new items on the menu. Why such drastic changes?  We started off with the bacon cheese fries, which are every bit as delicious as they normally are loaded with thick, real bacon bits; however, the portion is smaller than it used to be. I had one of the few burgers, which was pretty good as well, but a new one to me. Not sure if I would order the Kim Jong Moo again. The lady got the spicy parm wings, which were good, but could have used more parm (again hit or miss).  A friend ordered the new, we believe, \"original buffalo cauliflower\", which was barely cooked cauliflower drowning in hot sauce. It was neither deep fried or topped with blue cheese, in our opinions, as the description stated. Super pricey at $9 as well for about 10 pieces of cauliflower. Pretty dissappointing and the waiter offered no sympathy when we mentioned our dismay with them.  Finally, this place has been under renovation for the better part of this year and I wonder if it will ever be finished. Please finish the new bathrooms soon, as the current ones are pretty foul. I'll give them a 4 for now, but with recent changes and increased prices, I'm starting to think this place might become mediocre and a 3. There are still good things on the menu for sure, but the changes leave me miffed a bit.",

Burger was undercooked too much to eat, the wings were so rubbery and very tasteless. Maybe it was a bad sauce or who knows but I even asked for extra crispy as well . I'll put those 2 things under stuff I'll never order from there again. The chips though were amazing , crispy and tasty . Ranch dip was pretty funky as well . I'll try again someday but I'm not going to go out of my way to eat there ever again.",

    "text": "Giant sandwiches and great beer, what's better than that?   Although fat heads brewery is located in Ohio, fat heads in the south side is a pittsburgh must! Their menu is huge! Tons of unique \"headwiches\" (sandwiches literally as big as your head), burgers, appetizers and huge salads.   Last time I went I tried their pepperoni roll appetizer. I have to say I wasn't super impressed with how large it was for the money it cost. The pepperoni roll was good but nothing special and not worth $9 when you can get a similar one at get go for a little over a dollar.   I usually always get some sort of chicken sandwich. They are always delicious and packed with flavor. Another thing I am not a huge fan of though is the fact all chicken sandwiches and burgers come with their house made potato chips and it's an up charge if you want to switch your side. Personally I do not love their chips but also don't want to pay an additional $2 or so for fries or something else.   Their salads are hugeeeee and come in a big bowl. I've had their chicken salad most recently and it was delicious.   One thing I especially love about fat heads, is of course, their beer. You can find their six packs for a lot cheaper than what they sell in their store. My favorites are their seasonal spooky tooth (pumpkin delishisness), bumble berry (blueberry delishishness) and their head hunter IPA. They always have a ton of other awesome beers on draft as well!   Great place to kick back, enjoy a giant sandwich or salad and have a beer!",

My wife got the Pittsburgher salad and my daughter got chicken tenders. Their portions are absolutely huge! The service is always good and their beer variety is fantastic. I ordered the bumble berry beer which surprisingly wasn't cold enough. I was a little disappointed by that. It is a little on the pricey side, but it is on the south side of Pittsburgh so you got a figure that you'll pay a higher fare because it's in the city.   Overall, fatheads is one of my favorite places to frequent and we will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Fathead's is a Southside classic. They have local PA brews on tap, very large and delicious sandwiches and pretty good wings.   I've been here many times and the reason why I give it three stars versus four is because of consistency. The quality of the food varies in consistency as does the service.   On a good day, Fathead's is an easy 4. Some of their sandwiches, especially the spicy ones with habanero have some really unique (for Pittsburgh) and well thought-out flavor profiles. And their wings are also very good (Original Sauce is excellent) albeit not cheap. On top of that they also serve smoked wings, which may be the best way to eat wings in general. So the food can really be quite good.   It's just that in order to rise to a 4th star for me, repeat visits have to be at that level. So it's a very solid three, and I try my best not to succumb to grade inflation.   So if you like good beer, good food, big portions and really don't care about the service on any particular day, then go!",

The giant pretzel was excellent and can be made to order with regard to the amount of salt. Its soft and crunchy the only complaint i have is with the cheese, the flavor is just not quite right for me. Im not a big mustard fan but if you like mustard i believe these are likely some of the best.  She recommended any of the headwich but also recommended the smoked wings. We ordered the big beefy sandwich and added fries along w the smoked wings w sauce on the side. The sandwich was great, flavorful the sauce reminds you of a sloppy joe but in a good way. The wings were not seasoned enough for my liking. Its possible that sauce would've made them better but we went w the recommendation. The ranch is also one of the better ranches ive tasted, possibly made in house.   One irritation is the \"hassle to make fries w sandwhich\" rule. The fries and chips are good but both are not seasoned enough which is ok for the fries because most people add ketchup but the chips need help.",

We were just planing to hit all the bars and find one we liked. Well, we ended up here for 6 hours. What a great time we had.   The sandwiches are as big as your head, and loaded with all the ingredients and they are absolute deliciousness.   I drank The Epic Big Bad Baptista...very dark bourbon Stout. 12.5%...after 4 of them I was feeling very well. My fiance drank the rhubarb cider as well as Fat Heads own BumbleBerry which I have to say for a lighter beer, it had great flavor.  Nonetheless, stop here, sit at the bar, make friends around you and enjoy yourself. I will absolutely return to this place on every trip to Pittsburgh.  I believe our Bartender's name was Carrie, but I could be completely off...however if it was, she was great, and very personable. We had a great afternoon here.",

I came to the original location because my whole family are big fans of Fatheads and wanted to check this place out.   Everything was great until the last ten minutes of our time in the restaurant. There was a mix up with the bill. Myself and the people I was with misunderstood something the waitress said and asked her about it. She started off nice, but quickly turned nasty and started raising her voice at us. We asked for the manager and he came out after a few minutes. Nice guy, didn't give us any problems and quickly took care of the situation.   After our bill was adjusted, the waitress came back, slammed the receipt on the table and in the snottiest tone I have ever heard said, \"I took care of your bill and just so you know, I didn't charge you for your ranch dressing, which we are supposed to do\" and stormed off. Um, ok, thanks for doing us a favor?  A friend and I went to the restroom before we left and when we were walking back to our table, we walked past the kitchen (which is right next to the restrooms) we could clearly hear the manager and the waitress talking about our situation - kinda unprofessional, knowing that people can see and hear everything going on in there.   It is a shame because we had high expectations and left knowing we will never go back to this location again. Had the waitress right away, before the situation escalated, said \"let me get my manager,\" our experience may have been a lot better. And knowing that we had a high bill, and being good tippers, she could have had much more than the average 15% but instead, she got a 3% tip and hopefully a lesson in how to talk to customers.",

Our server was really helpful. After telling her that I really don't like beer at all, she suggested that I try a framboise lambic and brought over three samples for me to try. Very friendly and accommodating.   The food was great as well, a big chicken sandwich for me and a great burger for my boyfriend.

Add to that a constantly rotating stock, and delicious food (I recommend the Beauty and the Beastie sandwich, pulled pork and cole slaw, piled high and spicy to boot) and you've got a winner. The only drawback is conversation can be difficult when it's crowded, but if you're looking for a quiet sit-down restaurant, there's other places nearby.  Go upstairs to buy individual bottles and six-packs of beers you want - thanks to PA's archaic alcohol laws, this is one of the few places you can get beer in anything smaller than a case.",

    "text": "-The Fat Heads Saloon is located on East Carson which is a great strip of bars in downtown Pitt.  We stayed at the Double Tree which offers a free shuttle so it worked out beautifully.  After our beer buying trip around town we headed back to Fat Heads. It's a big place with a very nice bar.  Early in the day it's pretty dead, but at night its PACKED.    -At lunch I had tried the Headhunter which was outstanding.  I also tried a Ballast Point Sculpin because I had heard how great it was and we didn't get it in Buffalo.  -Fat Heads has a great beer menu with lots to choose from. Not only do they have about 10 beers of their own, they also have about 20-25 guest taps.  -The food was okay, servings were WAY too much food but I guess that's why it's called FAT Heads.  -Upstairs is merchandise and beer where you can create your own six pack. There's only about 4 coolers full of beer and let me tell you it isn't cheap. A six pack of sculpin was about 40$..ouch.  -On my next trip to Pittsburgh we went back and enjoyed their delicious beer once again. However this time around we got to experience Sunshine Daydream and this was a fantastic beer. A session IPA, at only 5%. I've had session beers and this one kills them all.   -If you're looking to buy their beer they only sell the Headhunter and Blueberry in bottles, the rest you can get growlers filled, however it MUST be a Fat Heads growler (they will take your non-Fat Heads growler however and replace it with theirs for free). But you can purchase their bottled beer at Fat Heads or simply walk up East Carson and buy a case at the beer store down the street.   -Street parking only.",

The hot pepper kraut is something special and the brisket? Sheesh!

Our server also left much to be desired as she mostly ignored our table when there was clearly a problem. Prior to serving the food, I had to yell at her to stop and asked if we were going to get our food soon since it'd been an extensive wait and people who arrived after us were minutes into their meals. She went to check on it and came back after someone else had served us asking, \"Was that quick enough for you?\" No, actually, it wasn't. Other than the bartender who was incredibly nice and attentive, I couldn't find anything nice to say about this place. Over-hyped. Come to Buffalo, we have significantly better gems than this.",

When I was lamenting over the lack of a good wing, my coworker recommended Fat Heads.  I may have to kiss him tomorrow.  Ok, maybe not, but they officially have the best wings I've had outside of Buffalo.  First, they actually call them wings.  Just wings!  They serve them with blue cheese, celery and carrots! And they are plump in size and cooked with a nice crisp.  Mmmmm. Their beer list is impressive as well.  I tried both the Santa's cinnamon apple cider and the Fatheads Holly Jolly Ale and loved both. The sandwiches looked incredible and came with home made chips.  I'm not sure I'll ever venture to that side of the menu because of how much I enjoy the wings, but there were plenty of unique and interesting combinations to satisfy any taste buds. I'm really looking forward to a repeat visit!",

But, often it is never there again. I miss Gordon, for example. Headhunter is always on tap. I have seen people drinking Bud Light in bottles so they have that, too.  The ribs get my vote for unsung hero. No one ever mentions them. Wings are tasty. I like spicy parmesan. Burgers are super, although I am not particular about the \"doneness\" of a burger. I have also enjoyed many sandwiches with pastrami and/or brisket.  Overall, above average bar food with a great beer list. You may have to wait for a table; but once you are seated, you never feel rushed. Servers are friendly. In reading other reviews, many rave about the portions; but, a lot of it is bread, plates overflowing with chips, and salads constructed from a head of iceberg lettuce.  Try the ribs. The full rack is 2.5 meals including fries. Beware the angry onion rings. Spicy going down and coming out the next day. Not recommended for vegans.",

    "text": "Their sandwiches (called headwiches) are huge. During weekend nights, the bar area gets to be pretty crowded, and you an hour wait for a table during dinnertime isn't unusual. They also have a huge selection of beers. I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't say much about that. It's pretty loud in here, so you do have to almost yell to talk to your buddies.  I came here on a Thursday around 6pm, and surprisingly, there were plenty of open tables. The headwiches consist of interesting combinations of just about anything a person might put on a sandwich. Normal sandwich meat, fried eggs, steak, mushrooms, pulled pork, brisket, bacon, chicken fingers, etc.  I ordered a Portly Fellow (one of the few things without meat), which consists of portabello mushrooms, roasted red peppers, spinach, tomato sauce, basil pesto, onion rings, mozzarella, goat cheese, and parmesan. Yes, the different cheeses sounds a bit excessive. It was just as massive as the other sandwiches, and there was a pretty good balance of flavors. I had some bites with a massive glob of goat cheese and nothing else, which was not particularly pleasant.  Some of my colleagues got burgers, which are much smaller than the sandwiches. You can consider them normal-sized. They all enjoyed their burgers as well.  Sandwiches are served with homemade chips. Some were really crispy, others were soggy from sitting in a puddle of oil. Burgers and some other items are served with fries. The fries are maybe almost steak fries, so there was no crunch to them. I would have preferred the fries over the chips, but they do NOT allow substitutions on that -- as explained by a long paragraph in the menu that I did not fully understand even after reading several times. All in all, a pretty good gigantic sandwich with chips on the side that I did not care for.",

They are all listed with their alcohol percentage and are well described and organized by category on the menu, so whether you like porters or pilsener (Or even if you don't know what that means yet), they'll help you find a new beer you'll love.  They also have a 6 pack shop where you can take your favorite beers home with you!  The service is always fast and friendly, the ambience is fun and including outdoor seating in the summer and most importantly the food is AMAZING!  Fat Heads are wizards with the noble potato.  My personal favorite is Pedro's nachos, fresh cut potato chip piled high with ground beef, sour cream, cheese and everything else delicious.  They have similar plates with potato skins and fries as well.    All their portions are deadly serious, I usually split one appetizer or entree between 3 people and still can barely finish it!  Their menu is lengthy, offering every kind of bar food you can imagine: Wings, Subs, Burgers, Salads, Headwiches (Sandwiches the size of your head), etc.  Every single dish I've had there has been the platonic ideal of bar food.  Always full flavored, generously portioned, hot and freshly prepared and home made.  If you're getting fueled up for a wild night in the south side or a game downtown, look no further then the Fat Heads Saloon!",

    "text": "Not that this place needs another review, but I'd like to give the out-of-towner review.  I've heard good things about this place on yelp as we were trying to fine a pre-game restuanrant on Carson.  We were expecting long lines thanks to previous yelp reviews so that wasn't a big issue.  The bar was extremely packed so we went to one of the bars next door to have a couple of beers before dinner.  We went back to FHS after about 45 min so our name wouldn't be called and us not be there.  We asked one of the friendly hostesses how much longer the wait was and she said not very long so we made our way to the bar.  Within 2 min she came and got us and said we're not next but she saw us and didn't feel like screaming, which was very nice of her.  Onto the food.....  We both had a burger, I had the Renee and my girlfriend had just a normal burger.  I gotta say it was much better than I expected and I left with a full and tired belly.  The waitress was not overly friendly but not overly attitude-ish as well.  She helped us out with some after dinner bars (see my review of Marios).  Fat Heads is definitely a place to go if you're visiting Pittsburgh or if you are extremely hungry.  I'll probably go back when/if I visit Pittsburgh again.",

You really don't need to get any appetizers here unless you want to take food home.  BUT, if you do get an appetizer, the shrooms are probably the way to go.  Never impressed by a fried mushroom before, I was impressed with these.  Big mushrooms with a really great horseradish sauce alongside them.  My girlfriend was a big fan of the Angry Cheesesteak as well.  And my buffalo chicken salad was huge and satisfying.  Great service and a great beer list, too.  Headhunter IPA!",

    "text": "One of Pittsburgh's must visit bars. Fatheads is almost always busy with a 30-60ish minute wait for a table every Friday + Saturday night. With that statistic, you'd think this was some kind of fancy, trendy restaurant. But, it's really not, it's a bar. A bar with a great beer selection, including their own brews, and a really delicious menu. This just goes to show that some of the best, most popular places don't have to be fancy or have a trendy foodie following. It just has to be damn good.   I'm a fan of their killer sauce hot wings. It makes me salivate just thinking about them. They have a huge selection of sandwiches, both heart-attack style and healthier. The big famous sandwich is the Southside Slope piled with kielbasa, pierogies, and toppings. But, since I am not (or try not to be) that much of a glutton, I'd go with the Meatless Millie, their pierogies sandwich with sauerkraut.  **I interrupt this review with a public service announcement**   You can not check out the Pittsburgh food scene without eating pierogies. what are they? don't ask, just order. Places to get good pierogies: Fatheads (duh.), Bloomfield Bridge Tavern (BBT), Church Brew Works, some Polish grandma's kitchen.   **Now back to your regular programming**  With a good selection of salads to choose from, even your healthy eating friends will enjoy Fatheads. But the real question is: why do you have healthy eating friends? and why would you go out to eat with them?   Oh, and last but definitely not least, the beer. That you'll have to experience for yourself.",

They have a great draft selection of their own microbrews as well as domestic and imports.   Overall, the service was very personable, the food was good, the beer was good and the price was right.

We were told it would be an hour long wait, so we headed to the bar which is of a big enough size to hold enough people waiting.  I had two different beers which were fantastic.  The food was worth the wait.  Perogi appetizer was really good.  I order the bacon cheeseburger which was good, although the patty was a bit too small for the bun.  The bun was of really good quality, which is super important.  The fries were also good and large in number.  Sandwiches come with chips, I grabbed some and was BLOWN away.  These are not chips from a bag, these are fantastic homemade chips.  So goooood and reasonably priced.  Also, if you buy a mix-n-match six-pack of beer in the little store up top, there is some special deal like $10 off or something.  Worth checking out!",

If you end up anywhere near the the outside patio or the front desk, you'd probably get better service at a Dennys. Maybe that's where they put the part-timers who don't last, who knows.   The front desk is horrid. It's a bunch of women who don't know how to assign seating and scoff if you ask to be moved away from the tables that are right near the 20 degree doorway. One particular blonde should have probably been fired the day she was hired.

I personally enjoyed the house Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale alongside one of their \"headwiches,\" named because they're \"the size of your head.\" No kidding! The \"mo betta beef n' chedda\" was packed with house-smoked brisket, house-made bacon, roasted mushrooms, sharp cheddar, and chipotle mayo. Absolutely delish!

    "text": "Our group of 5 came in after an 8 hr day at Roethlisberger camp. We were starving. The only complaint i have is that you can't check in with a group larger than 4 so we had to physically go into the restaurant to check in where we were told the wait would be an hour. The app told us 9-20 minutes. Not sure how those apps are updated but the app was correct, not the actual human employee, which we found odd, but were very happy it wasn't an hour wait. And very glad we didn't end up leaving to find a restaurant with less wait time. We've never eaten here so we didn't know the deliciousness we'd miss out on had we left.   We sat in a little waiting area/gift shop before we were taken to our table. We had time to look at the menus to see what we wanted. The descriptions of the different meals were all really well written and some funny. They seated us upstairs (the kids really liked that) The kids also got a kick out of the name of the establishment. Our friends ordered the giant pretzel that came with 3 sauces and the cheese stix appetizer. Really delicious.   The sandwiches we ordered were huge! And they came with homemade potatoes chips. My son ordered the Big beefy bbq headwich. I ordered the Southside Slopes headwich (not something I would usually order but I'm glad I tried it) I ate half of the sandwich at Fat Heads and could not wait to eat the rest the next day for lunch. The food was great. The waitress and service were excellent. I would definitely go back here to try another one of their sandwiches.",

They didnt do anything special like sing which was honestly kind of disappointing. I had looked at their menu before visiting as I heard their sandwiches were big and tasty. However, when we got there, we noticed that Monday night is Wing Night and wings are 60 cents each. We knew this was a game changer that we had to go with. I went with some Garlic Parm and Black & Yellow wings as we could mix and match sauces. I also added some onion rings as a side. The wait for our food was pretty long and for about 25 minutes even though the place didnt seem that packed. My Garlic Parm wings were probably my favorite but had too much cheese on them so I was happy I did not order a lot. Some of my friends got the same wings and another type of wings with parmesan cheese and they both agreed about the cheese. The Black & Yellow wings had some type of tangy barbecue sauce which were pretty tasty too. The onion rings were very flavorful and extremely crispy which I enjoyed. I tried a couple of the home made chips that come with sandwiches but they were honestly not that great as some weren't crispy and tasty enough and just tasted plain. Overall, the wings were definitely the highlight of the meal as they were really good and great for their price. Everyone was satisfied with their meals and very full. Our server was very friendly and visited us pretty often. I definitely recommend coming here for the wings and beer.",

I went for many wing nights in my day and it's always a great space to stop in for a good beer from their giant beer list.  My go-to sandwich has always been the McMinns Chicken Dance. Spicy chicken, an egg, lettuce, mayo, on a bun - with their signature chips... so. good. I always get this when I'm doing take-out, and frequently still get it when I'm in the restaurant.   The salads, known as head-wiches are full salads! Friends tend to love these as you can get everything possible in a salad there! The potato skins are a great appetizer, and the burgers seem to be favorites of friends too!  They've recently renovated with a great outdoor space and updated bar area. They also have their beer to-go and souvenirs in the upstairs loft area.",

    "text": "Shoutout to the bartender who sat with me while my drunk ass loudly brainstormed whether Fat Heads was a Cleveland brewery or a Pittsburgh one. We ultimately decided that the beer is from Cleveland, but the food is from Pittsburgh. Whether we're right or wrong doesn't matter. We used our intellect and teamwork to arrive at our well thought conclusion, and I refuse to hear any other theories or ideas about it.  Now that we have that settled, I'm sure you want to know about the food and drink. Consensus: it is gooooood. My friend and I ordered some much needed apps. We had frickles (fried pickles), shrooms, bacon and cheddar fries, and the original smoked wings. Sriracha thousand island and horseradish accompanied the fried veggies, which was unexpected and a delicious touch. I am the sauce queen, so you can take my opinion as canon. The fries were cooked well, but the cheddar cheese sauce tasted like lukewarm cheese whiz. It's kind of like they decided to play Philly with the fries. Someone's thought process had to have been \"Okay, we hate Philadelphia. We're the better Penn city. How do we show it? Ooh, I know! Let's take one of their star food items, make it gross, and toss it on one of America's greatest foods!\" That's totally fine and a Pittsburgh type of thing to do, but you could warn a girl first ya know?   But okay, move over fry-wreck, I need to talk about wings. MMM wings. I may be considered the sauce queen, but I can appreciate a properly cooked smoked wing. You don't sauce a dry wing. That would be an abomination on both my sauceland and the domain of my ally, the smoker. Luckily Fat Head's is aware, and gives you the option of order extra dry rub on your smoky deliciousness. No sauce here buddy! These wings are huge; they are the full wing, after all. We ordered a 5 piece, and considering the other apps we had, were very pleased with our choice. Had we ordered more we would have left a lot of food on the table. I don't know about you, but I hate wasting good food.   The beer is as varied and plentiful as you can imagine. Fat Head's is an excellent brewery, but the saloon makes the smart decision of offering other Pennsylvania crafts so you have to attempt to make an educated decision. Then again, in my head, there's no such thing as a bad beer, but there are some beers that I absolutely adore and some that I'll drink because it's given to me. (I'm looking at you, Bud Lite.) My friend had the Blueberry Ale, which is one of their more famous beers. I'm not a fruity beer drinker, so I went for their Shakedown stout. At 8.6%, this was not a good follow up to all the high ABV stouts I had earlier, but I like to keep some things in the family, ya feel?  Fat Heads is a great option on the South Side, and if you've never visited before, you'll find you have a lot of places to choose from. Just do me a favor, and make time to stop in for a fat pint.",

We went at lunch time on a Friday afternoon so we had a bit of a wait, plus we were a party of 10 but they sat as us soon as they could.

    "text": "Okay. I feel like this place should be more talked about than it is. I think it was on Outrageous Foods with Tom Pizzica so that's where I heard about it. It's a restaurant-brewery so don't bring a date here thinking you'll have an elegant evening. In fact, this place is probably the opposite of elegant (but really, aren't those places the best ones?)  The main event here is definitely the headwiches. Some (or all?) of them are named after regulars and contain some bizzare combinations of ingredients I would never have thought of but are oh-so-yummy together. I tried the southside slopes and the \"mo\" betta beef and chedda headwiches. The southside had kielbasa, fried pierogies, grilled onions, american cheese and horseradish sauce while the \"mo\" betta beef and chedda had smoked beef brisket, portabello mushrooms, bacon, sharp cheddar, and chipotle mayo. I believe the menu said that the southside headwich was Maxim magazine's #5 best sandwich in the nation and it definitely didn't disappoint. I'd go so far as to say it was the star of the evening, and maybe even my whole visit to the Pittsburgh area (foodie-wise, at least).  The headwiches are all served with their housemade potato chips which are AMAZING. Thinly cut but still thick enough to be more than crispy oil. They were perfectly seasoned and stayed delicious even several hours after dinner as a late night snack, when my second wind struck.  The appetizers all looked pretty tasty also. Unfortunately, in anticipation of the huge headwiches, we opted only for one: the char-grilled wings smothered in smoky barbecue sauce. There are 14(?) sauces but I can't really take the heat so I stayed out of the fire! The wings were fantastic, let me tell ya. It was recommended by our waitress along with the smoked chicken, spinach & artichoke dip and the pedro's nachos made with their housemade potato chips.. if you're with a large enough group and on the fence about which appetizers to order. Don't get too ambitious if you're not because I saw an order of the chicken, spinch, artichoke dip pass our table and it was LARGE.  The place also brews its own beers. When we went (around 5p), their house-brewed beers were half off for happy hour until 6p. I also noticed that they had a late night \"happy hour\" where their headwiches were half off from 10p - midnight. For the beers, typical stuff. I ordered my usual hefeweizen but I noticed they had a bumble berry on draft which was a blueberry-honey brew that I'd kind of wished I tried. The draft menu changes frequently--as the taps run out--so you'll just have to go and see what's available. There are 42 varieties to choose from so don't worry about not being able to find something to your liking though.  What else, what else.. we didn't stay for dessert but the meal overall was fantastic. If you're visiting the area (like I was) and are into souvenir things, there is a gift shop upstairs that has t-shirts, a few of their beers (bottled) and other knick-knack things for sale. If you have your receipt from the meal, you can get an additional 10% off too!  Oh wow, that was a lot of words. Like I said, lots to talk about with this place! Can't believe there aren't 1000+ reviews raving about it. Give it a shot; there are lots of eateries in the downtown area but this place is definitely a gem you don't want to miss.",

Atmosphere - this place is crowded and has a great vibe.    Please note their side room gets very warm in my opinion.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to fat heads for the first time this weekend. We were in Pittsburgh for the very first time and we saw that this restaurant had good reviews so we decided to venture out and try. It was around 7 pm on a Saturday night. At first the hostess told us it would be about 40 minutes, but we ended being seated in less than 10. We sat in the indoor/outdoor area which was perfect for a sunny Saturday night. The food came out very fast! We started with the spicy parm wings which were the perfect about of heat and flavor. Afterwards we got two burgers which came with fries. My boyfriend got the pulled pork chili burger and the buns they use and perfect because it holds everything together wonderfully! I was full, and happy. The prices are fair and reasonable. I wish there was a fat heads near my house because I would go every weekend!",

I told the bartender but that I was going to eat it because I was starving. He took it anyway because he wanted me to have a good experience  and had me a new one in minutes.   The food was great.

    "text": "Fat Head's prides itself on the huge beer list, the massive sandwiches, and the homemade potato chips. It's also a great place for any occasion--as an undergraduate, we would venture out to Fat Head's when our parents visited to show them a neat place; as a graduate student, i would stumble into Fat Heads for a meal that could last me all day; living in the South Side, I would come back late at night to peek in and try a new beer; and, working in the South Side, it's always a treat to \"forget\" my lunch just for a chance to eat at Fat Head's.  After going so many times, I've learned to stay away from the huge beer list, the massive sandwiches, and the homemade potato chips (well, maybe not the last one). If you're venturing out to Fat Head's and want something good that isn't usually recommended, here's a short list of my favorite non-headwich menu items:  1. The grown-up grilled cheese is filling, delicious, and everything you'd hope to get in a giant grilled cheese. 2. Get your wings char-grilled and then rubbed with whatever sauce you like the most. I'm not the biggest fan of their barbecue sauce, but the char-grilled wings go well with anything and are a welcomed departure from breaded-deep-fried. 3. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary Bloody Mary Bloody Mary. Probably my favorite Bloody Mary in the city. Definitely my favorite booze drink on the menu. 4. The Fat Head's twist on classics doesn't stop at grilled cheese; the reuben is also a huge and delicious treat. For that matter, so is their cheesesteak.  Next time you end up at Fat Head's, if the Jack-o doesn't look like it fits your craving, branch out! You won't be disappointed.",

I always get the Bumbleberry, which is a blueberry and honey beer which comes with fresh blueberries in the pint.   I hate to put bad news first or last, so I'll throw it in the middle.  Their steak has really been missing the mark lately.  I've ordered it a few times, each time medium rare.  All but once it came out medium well to well done instead.  I cut them a little slack since steak isn't their specialty, but any good chef should know the difference between a warm red center and a hot colorless center.  But when the steak has come out to temp, it's delicious!  Typically, aside from the few times I gave their steak a shot, I get the same few things.  I start  with a giant plate of fresh cut garlic fries accompanied by chicken fingers with a side of bbq sauce.  The nachos are definitely to die for as well.  Their sandwiches [ahem, headwiches] are massive and really impressive, too.  Overall, I give Fat Heads an A+ and highly recommend it.",

I recently had the frickles which was of course a huge portion, perfectly crispy and not a soggy or oily pickle in the bunch.   I am also a really big fan of the smokin thighs sandwich which is a very large portion and enough for two or three meals and reheats well in the toaster oven.   I will definitely be back!   Also don't forget to get a side of their smoky bbq and ranch for dipping the chips (they do charge for them, but the portion is big and is a necessity!) that come with the sandwich, you can thank me later!",

As appetizers, we ordered the pretzel and loaded fries. I'm a sucker for French fries, and these were delicious. They're not super crispy, but they weren't soggy either. So they were absolutely perfect to me. The pretzel was also really good. The inside is fluffy and soft while the outside is extremely crunchy very unlike regular soft pretzels. The three dipping sauces were just as good. My favorite was the beer cheese.  I was already full from the appetizers, but for our main course we ordered the Italian \"headwich\" hot. It is HUGE and was easily split between three women. I didn't care too much for it, and I'm not exactly sure why. I think I just didn't like all of the meat on it, or I wasn't in the mood for that particular sandwich. It also came with homemade chips which were good, but I love my French fries. We also had an order of the mild wings, and they were decent.  Quick tip: read the small print on the menu you'll get a better understanding of their items. The headwiches and sandwiches come with chips, and the burgers come with French fries. No substitutions.",

Let me begin by saying that we literally looked at the menu for 20 minutes after ordering an appetizer (onion rings!).. actually we looked at the menu so long that there was a server-switch for our table/section. I should also mentioned that after I finally decided what I wanted, Bobby brought up that there was still a back side to the menu. I didn't even look-- I closed the menu and made my final decision.. The BBQ Chicken.   I'm not sure why I decided on that.. It's a sandwich with coleslaw on it & I'm not the coleslaw-sandwich type of person.. But it sounded amazing. (BBQ sauce, provolone cheese, onion & coleslaw) Actually every sandwich description made you want to try it which is why it was so hard to decide. My sandwich was tasty and I was happy that I was able to decide on the type of BBQ sauce (more decisions!) The slaw & BBQ chicken went well together.  Bobby ordered the Angry Cheese Steak (shaved steak, red peppers, jalapenos, onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, spinach & chipotle mayo wrapped in a tortilla) It looked delish! He was only able to finish the first half.  I'm happy the server mentioned that the onion rings were spicy, because for some reason I didnt notice. Mannn, I may look like a wuss but those were extra spicy! They definitely defeated me.. I stopped after 5 & I'm surprised I made it that far.    Next time I'm ordering a salad. Goodness that thing looked huuuuge.",

I thought, \"If this is the best food in Pittsburgh, why would I possibly want to stay another day??\"  The answer: FAT HEADS SALOON.  We went in expecting an okay lunch, and instead we both had multiple food-gasms.   Fried perogie appetizer?? AWESOME. Perfect little pillows of potatoes and pleasure.  I ordered the extreme pastrami and the boyfriend ordered the big beefy barbecue. My obsession with pastrami started about 3 months ago and this just made it more intense. The thick slices of meat and hot pepper mayo made for an amazing combination, but egg on a sandwich is always a selling point for me. Overall the best sandwich I have ever eaten. Ever.   Based upon the sauce covering boyfriend's face from nose-to-chin and ear-to-ear, I would say he was pretty pleased as well. North Carolina eastern BBQ is what I was raised on, so I'm not one to judge his sandwich.   People of Pittsburgh, are you trying to get people out of your town by sending them to a hole in the wall with bland sandwiches? STOP IT! Send people to Fat Heads.",

There is always a wait so go in knowing that ( they do not take reservations) but stop at the bar during your wait. I highly recommend the Bumbelberry ( blueberry beer and they top it off with fresh berries) or the nice selection of Arsenal cider they have on draft. If you are a fan of wings they make a great starter and many different sauces to choose from. The menu is overwhelming with burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads etc. The salads are big enough to feed a small country but I recommend getting one of the meaty sandwiches. This past visit I went with the beef brisket sandwich topped with BBQ sauce, cheese sauce, pickles, tomato and horseradish sauce.  It was super messy but delicious although a substitute for the roast beef sandwich they took off the menu. The service is usually quick and the servers are average. Great place to go in the summer as they have a very nice outdoor seating area.",

The veggie burger is pretty decent, especially the one with all the fixins, but there isn't all that much to offer vegetarians or vegans.

The place was half full and we waited 1.5 hours for our meal. We ordered our burgers rare...I'm being dead honest, our burgers were well done, we cut them in half and the beef crumbled from being overdone. We didn't send them back for fear of another hour plus wait. The restaurant filthy, complete with a spit was on the wall next to me. Our waitress was nice enough, but twice a kitchen person bumped into me without a simple \"sorry\". The only good thing was the order of smoked wings with Carolina sauce..pretty tasty. The bathrooms were filthy. Unfortunately I strongly recommend not going here unless you want to get wasted, it's a good atmosphere for that I suppose.",

If you're looking for a casual place to catch up with friends - over a massive plate of nachos - go to Fat Heads  (though be prepared to wait awhile if it's game night.)

    "text": "Not quite divey, and not quite a gastropub. It fills somewhat of a grey area between the two. When I first entered I was prepared for a more intimate experience. Perhaps I should have managed my expectations since I was on the Southside.   The menu is an exercise in absurdism. Upon opening, the menu is overwhelming. It is unclear how many check-ins would be required to truly understand the taste of Fatheads. Yet I get the impression that most of the items probably taste the same. The fries are underwhelming.  I had the spiciest option for the wings, and they did not live up to their description. Even though the spiciness was not up to par, the taste of the sauce was exceptional. I would order them again.  I ordered the Fathead version of a Ruben. They were aiming for portion size over taste. At no point did I feel like I was eating a Ruben, Though somewhat tasty, I was lost in the bread and coleslaw and ultimately did not feel like I was noshing on a Ruben.  But what perturbed me most is that I had no inclination to return. The beer is great but the environment was not welcoming in a bar/pub sense. Because it felt busy and rushed, it is not a place to sit down, enjoy a local brew, and connect with friends after work. It is most akin to a chain sit-down restaurant with craft beer. This is a shame because the drafts that I tried were superb.   Stop by for a beer (or two), try some of the food, but constantly feel like your table needs to cleared for another customer.",

Though I don't know and never want to know the True number I firmly believe it's a 10,000 calorie sandwich.  All that being said: it's worth it.  You probably won't find this in Warsaw but it's my favorite expression of Polish cuisine. Pierogies and keilbasa stacked a foot high...impossible to go wrong.         Admittedly, Fat Head's also holds a special place in my heart as the locale of my very first (legal) drink - Maredsous 8, which remains a solid Belgian dubbel.  Nostalgia and \"death-on-a-plate\" sandwiches aside, there's a lot else to like. The draft list is consistently very good, though why they keep Miller Lite on I will never understand.  I'm also a fan of the bottle shop upstairs, but be warned, due to insane PA laws you pretty much have to pay bar prices when taking things to go.  My only other gripe is that I wish they would expand the standing area immediately in the front of the bar. I realize this would be a major renovation but it would alleviate being smashed in as well as make it a better place to watch games.",

Then the rebirth: not sure if a new owner or what, but the food is back to heavenly (the smoked/grilled wings are insane - best wings in town - and the head-sized sandwiches are ridiculous) and their beer is now among the best in the country (especially Belgian triple-style Zeus Juice & Head Trip, Belgian dubbel-style Sorcerer & Spooky Tooth pumpkin).

And i wasn't even disappointed when they didn't have it!  Just went on to Red Seal.  It was an absolute shock and so i had to hype it up to others!  The food itself was pretty good.  Portions are gigantic and i almost passed up a hamburger for one of their really good looking salads. But its unlike me to pass on a burger.  I ordered the beach burger, which was pretty much your regular old american cheese cheese burger, with lettuce, tomato and onion.  It was nothing special but it was good.  I also enjoyed the fries... reminded me of my permanti brothers sandwich the day before!  Their sandwiches come with homemade chips which i tasted and were very good.  We had gotten fried perogies  after all the hype from the pirates game and they were excellent.  I mean could they really mess up mashed potatoes fried and served with sour cream?

    "text": "I can't believe I've lived in Pittsburgh for over two years and had never visited Fat Head's until last night.  This place is as close to perfect as a pub can get.  Let's start with the most important factor: the beer.  Fat Head's has over 40 taps, most of which feature premium craft brews that rotate frequently; they even have beer on cask, which is hard to find.  Included are several of Fat Head's own brews; I tried their stout, which was fantastic.  Unfortunately for this hop-head, they were out of their IPA, which I've heard is stellar.    On to the food.  I began by ordering some of their spiciest wings as an appetizer.  \"Are you sure?\" the waitress asked several times.  \"They're EXTREMELY hot.\"  Yeah, I'm sure.  Not surprisingly, the wings were nothing I couldn't handle, but they did have very pleasant flavor and heat.  Neither can match the Colombian gum numbers at Harris Grill, but they're up there.  The wings themselves, however, are superior: big meaty pieces fried hard, just the way I like it.    Fat Head's is famous for their \"headwiches.\"  These things are pretty big, and the four of us were already a bit full from the wings, so we just ordered two to share: the South Side Slopes (kielbasa, pierogies, grilled onions, and provolone cheese [sub for American cheese, which is an abomination]) and the Expert Pastrami (pastrami, hot Italian sausage, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg).  Both sandwiches were quite tasty and, needless to say, filling -- American excess at its finest.  They also come with a big pile of homemade potato chips, which were very good.  By the end of the meal I was stuffed to the point of intestinal discomfort, which is rare for me; though I'm not a big guy, I can usually out-consume even my fat friends with no problem.    The atmosphere at Fat Head's was just fine, as was the service.  The only drawback to this place is its location; I don't care for the South Side and it's not convenient to get to.  Maybe it's for the best, though, as if this place were near my house I'd soon find myself broke and morbidly obese.",

The homemade chips were a nice touch, but I didn't really care for them a whole lot.  The outside porch area was very nice, with fans blowing a cool mist for hot summer days, or big outdoor heaters for cold days.

Both arrived extremely quickly. The headwich was absolutely delicious. They also have a great selection of beers on tap, including a few that are brewed for Fat Head's.  The only complaint I have is that all of the headwiches come with chips, not fries, by default, and they make kind of a big deal on the menu about 'no substitutions.' It's not that their chips are bad, it's that I prefer fries, and why is it such a big deal if people don't want potato chips with their meal, anyway?",

There are so many burgers and sandwiches, and they all sound great, it really is a chore deciding. I had the Bay of Pigs sandwich. Its their take on the cuban sandwich, roast pork, ham, pickles, honey mustard, and caribean hot sauce. This sandwich was awesome. The sauce is pretty spicey but it made the sandwich. My friend got a bacon, bbq, swiss burger which he devoured like his life depended on it. Overall it was a great meal, fun atmosphere, and more than reasonable prices.

    "text": "Why is Primanti's considered the shining example of Pittsburgh food when Fat Heads exists? I'm usually pretty unimpressed by places whose primary claim to fame is gigantic portions of greasy food, but Fat Heads does it right. Wings are super spicy and some of the best in Pittsburgh. The Arrogant Onion Rings are somehow even spicier than the wings with some seriously fluffy batter (made with, what else, Arrogant Bastard Ale). And the Kelsey Burger has a pierogie on it...enough said. It is a gamble whether your burger will be overcooked or not...and if it is overcooked, you'll probably end up finishing it before your server comes back around because they aren't exactly the most attentive. Even so, I come back here at least once a month. And somehow, I have yet to try one of their headwiches...next on my to-do list!  And oh, the beer! I love the way their beer list is set up. It's pretty extensive, but not overwhelming. I like trying new beers, but I can be indecisive, so I'm glad Fat Heads makes my decision easier with their OCD list of drafts. It's organized by type, has an informative description of each beer, and tells you the ABV so you can plan your selections based on just how drunk you want to get (well, I do anyway).  The only downside is that it gets super crowded on the weekends or during sporting events. But they do take your phone number to call when your table is ready and hey, it's the Southside...go have drinks at any of the ten million other bars on Carson Street while you wait!",

Highlights include homemade potato chips, which accompany the regular sandwiches and even appear in the nachos (somehow, it works).  I didn't think I was ready for a Headwich, and it's a good thing I didn't order one, because the regular turkey melt was plenty.  Maybe next time...",

As everyone else has mentioned, they have an impressive list of beers from all over the country and some from Belgium too (42 beers on tap and I don't know how many bottled). I was quite excited by all the ciders/lambics they had on tap (apple, raspberry, peach, pear). The beer list has a small description of the beer's profile, alcohol content %, and the beer advocacy rating, which was very helpful and fun to look through.   The menu is giant and the portions are giant too. We ordered the pirogis and they were damn good (granted it was my first time ever trying pirogis so I don't have any other place to compare too). The nachos were pretty bomb: freshly cut & fried potato chips (so they had a french fry flavor but chip consistency) with a ton of nacho cheese, jalapenos, olives, tomatoes, and sour cream. I also got a side salad and it was as big as an entree salad would be someplace else.   Fat Heads is a good place to enjoy beer & satisfy your stomach.",

Went there with a friend who got the volcanic wings and he offered me one, with me be unaware of what level he'd ordered. First bite seemed ok... but by the next one, my mouth was on fire.

    "text": "I was always told how great Fat Head's was. Unfortunately I was more underwhelmed than amazed by the famous Carson Street eatery. It is basically a greasy spoon with a lot of beer.  All everyone talks about at Fat Head's is the beer. Don't get me wrong, as a hop headed beer snob the beer is the only reason the place got a 2 star in my book. They have about 50 selections on tap with at least 3 of their own from their brewery in*cough*Cleveland*cough*. Avoid the FH beers. They fall into the classic trap of thinking more hops = better beer. This equation makes for same tasting beers with not charachter or personality of their own. All in all a good place for a brew.  The food however leaves something to be desired. The food is greasy and disgusting. It's all overpriced and overspiced. I get the spiciness; blow out our taste buds so we buy more beer. This is all well and good if you are just looking for a booze sponge, but for those of us who aren't six feet deep in our cups, the food is lackluster on a good day. Aside form the sandwiches being bland, overspiced and dripping grease, the sides (hand cut chips and fries) are pretty bad too. I have mentioned in another review that a fry should be seasoned and crispy, even more so if it is a fresh chip. No dice at Fat Head's. Chips and fries come out cold, rubbery and seasonless. It makes me think they just run their fryers constantly and just have a huge batch of chips and fries at all times, which makes the policy of not being able to substitute them even more infuriating (I am forking over a sizeable chunk of my hard eaned money, now give me what I want!).  For those of you that want a grease mop to soak up the alcohol you could do worse. For those of us that are still aware of the taste buds in our mouths, we can do much, much better.  The atmosphere is Fat Head's is kind of spotty as well. On the rare occasions when they aren't packed to the rafters, I really dig it. The staff is usually friendly (I think I had one iriitable and incompetent server a few months ago, but I haven't seen him since) and I am a sucker for exposed brick. However, more often than not the place is swarmed and packed so tight with, to be honest, every kind of asshole imaginable, that I can't even enjoy myself when I am there.  To sum up, come for the beer after you already have a full belly.",

I don't know if it's because the place was JAM packed (because of the World Cup) this past Saturday, but the food was seriously lacking. Even as I passed by each person's table, the nachos and burgers all looked pretty unappetizing.  My biggest gripe was that the Classic Chicken Club sandwich was described as being the Fat Heads' Classic Steak Sandwich but substituted w/ chicken... it totally wasn't. Not only that, the grilled chicken they used were also literally chicken chunks (yes, the kind used in salads). Honestly, who uses grilled chicken chunks in a SANDWICH? At least, use a slab of grilled chicken! This made for a messy and soggy sandwich, where all of the contents (including all of the grilled chicken chunks) fell out pre-bite.  I'm willing to give this place another chance though... Stay tuned for an update.",

It's extra tasty the day after a late night out, the greasy goodness definitely helps in the detoxification process.    I've been eating here for years and was very excited to try out the new menu. I couldn't wait to see what culinary gems had been added and needless to say, I was delighted. They've kept their standards: wings, headwiches, burgers, etc., so if you have a favorite item, most likely it's still there.   After much deliberation I went with the brand new Mo Betta Beef N Chedda, which the menu describes as: smoked beef brisket, sharp cheddar, portobello mushrooms, bacon and chipotle mayo.  Umm..bacon, cheddar and brisket?? Sign me up.  It was delicious, just the right amount of cheese and meats. I even dipped mine in a side of ranch to add to the caloric intake.   The wait is usually long (about an hour, but that's just enough time to grab a beer at the bar or head next door to Casey's for a brew) but it's totally worth it. You'll leave stuffed to capacity but it's bite for bite one of the best places in the Burgh.   If you see me there, say hello! I've got a lot of new menu items to try out...  PS - Think you'd never eat healthy at Fathead's? Think again! Also on the new menu are veggie burgers and new salads that aren't loaded with fries and cheese. Boring, maybe, but at least there are options!",

I got takeout from here around my birthday last year and back then tried The Nicole Burger, which is a typical American cheeseburger with fried onion crisps and Ranch dressing just to make it a little more interesting, and I must say that I enjoyed it. It rivaled Tessaro's fer sure. The homemade potato chips were a treat too.  Yesterday I went with a new female friend and was kind of overwhelmed. God this place has a shockingly huge menu! It's a good thing I don't drink as I'm sure my head would have exploded with the myriad of choices!  I'm a bit of a Yogi Berra when it comes to restaurants I don't regularly frequent  that have awesome selections, so I went with the Classic Bacon Cheeseburger. The way I see it, if a joint can handle a standard well, I'm sold. Well, they did just fine. The patty was plump, juicy. The bacon was exqusitely crisp and light. I even picked up and ate the little pieces that fell onto the plate. This was a he-man's burger, and it damn near whooped my ass.    I did something really naughty; I got egg on it for about a buck extra.  Ya gotta try that sometime if you haven't already. Your arteries will pitch a fit, but yer taste buds 'n' tummy will owe you favors for this act of defiance.  The fries were crunchy yet soft, but methinks the kitchen needs to change their oil a little more often. Fries should be golden not bronze.   We also tried the Arrogant Onion Rings, and again they were dark, but the batter was fluffy, the onions were al dente, and unlike other folks' onion rings, the breading stayed put. The batter is made from-get this- Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale. What a gas! It comes with a wonderfully spicy/tangy ranch dressing for dipping as well.   My friend liked her Bacon Blues Burger, which is basically the Bacon Cheesburger with blue cheese dressing.   The atmosphere was very chatty and fun. We ate outside, which always makes for good people-watching. In fact, the place almost comes off as a steakhouse in that we actually had to wait for a table, but once you get seated yer family y'know?  Kudos to server Rachel for her agility and grace.  'Nother Very Minor Complaint: None of their burgers offer avocado as a fixin'. Why is that? I asked if it was possible to get some of that green veggie fudge on my burger and was told they don't carry it at all. Rachel thought that was slightly lame also. Perhaps I was spoiled by Ruby Tuesday's Triple Prime? No big deal though, but Mr. errr... Head (?) should take heed.   I did consider getting the Fiery Voodoo Killer Burger if for no other reason than that it just sounded SO metal!  \\m/   Yes, our musical tastes lean Hessian. Got a problem with that? Hmmm?  Fiery Voodoo Killer. What a name for a band. Maybe I'll try that next trip.",

Bryan went to the bar and ordered us beers. Not sure what mine was called but it was a berry type beer. It was very good and went down a little too easy. It was really good. It took about 30 min to get a table and the one we got was in the outside area. That being said if it's summer or winter this will be vary uncomfortable. I'm sure we could have waited for an inside table but we were so hungry. Our waitress seemed to take forever for everything. Now onto the menu. There is a huge sandwich selection along with lots of other stuff like burgers and salads. I went with the with the divine swine and it was tasty. I wish they were served with fries instead of chips. My 2nd beer was a wheat wine and it really wasn't that good. Overall this is an ok place I wish the service was a little better and that there was more inside seating. With that said if you have a friend in town and want to take the to a Pittsburgh place this would be a good option.",

The best part was that the crowd was much older than the typical Carson crowd. I'd estimate most patrons to be in their mid-thirties, and for the first time on Carson, I felt young!  Our food was great, although the service was a little disappointing. Our waitress made it clear she was in a hurry and did not have much patience.",

FH's is like the Baskin Robins of beer! 42 flavors on tap and they rotate beers in and out, so you're always sure to try something new. Today I had the Liefmans Cuvee-Brut and it was so good! A nice sour cherry Belgian ale...yum!   But let's move onto the food. FH's has a HUGE menu and portions to match! Yes - they have wings - but they are by far the best wings in Pittsburgh. Fantastic sauces from sweet to savory, mild to mouth-searing smothered on nice-sized wings....not the skimpy bones with a half a bite of chicken that I've been served at QS&L.   No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. This was proven to me today when I tried something new - the Beauty & Beasty Sandwich which had slow-roasted pulled pork, BBQ sauce, dill pickles, onions, and homemade cole slaw piled on a hearty bun. Perfect! It was huge! I couldn't eat the whole thing. This also holds True with their burgers - which are fresh and handmade and piled with awesome toppings!  Don't pass up the appetizers either! One of my favories is the 'Shrooms, which are hand-breaded in a herby batter and piled in a basket big enough for 2-3 people! The chicken quesadilla is also a regular favorite for us.   I suggest we petition to make Fat Head's the Pittsburgh icon rather than the \"Brothers\" sandwich place.",

    "text": "First, Fat Head's is a GREAT place to find an excellent variety of draft beer. I think there are something like 60 beers rotating on tap at any given time, and the variety is wonderful! If you're the type who likes to explore the current landscape of delicious beers being brewed these days in draft form, Fat Head's is definitely one of the best options in town. The variety (on draft) is just tough to beat. If you plan on being a regular, you can also join their beer club, which eventually lands you your name on the wall and some free Fat Head's swag. Not a bad deal if you're going to be drinking there regularly anyway!  The second in-your-face aspect of Fat Head's is the food. There's really no way to avoid looking like a gluttonous human when you receive your order, regardless of what you choose. If you want a salad, it's size of your head. If you order a burger, it's larger than you expected, and served with a heaping side of fresh chips. If you order a headwich, you'll look like you're in training for a food eating competition. In general, I think the spectacle is more appealing than the actual food itself, but that's not to say that the sandwiches aren't good. They're not the best burgers or sandwiches you'll ever have, but they're definitely good. My only real food-based complaint - and it's totally a personal preference - is their \"potato policy.\" I'm not a big fan of chips, and their fries are really good. Unfortunately, only certain sandwiches come with fries, and you're not allowed to substitute, so I typically leave a plate of wasted chips if I get a burger.  Another thing that some might find hard to digest is the extensive menu. It borders on the ridiculous. While the descriptions are enjoyable to read, skimming through the various combinations of meat, encased meats, ground meats and the endless toppings can seem a bit daunting upon your first visit, so you might want to take a look before arriving, or check out the menu while you wait.  As far as service is concerned, I've never had bad service at Fat Head's. The food comes out quickly, and the wait staff are generally really nice. Plus, the outdoor seating area is great in the warmer months. The only True drawback of the entire Fat Head's experience is the wait. As a resident of Southside, I can stroll there whenever it's dead, but for most people who plan their visits around lunch or dinner, be prepared to wait quite a while. The list grows quickly, and in no time you're giving them your name and number so the host/hostess can call you when your table is ready. Either that, or you'll be standing in the bar area wasting time perusing the beer list on the wall. The latter isn't a bad option, but sometimes there are just too many people doing that to make it a truly enjoyable experience...especially if you have a group of, say, 4 or more and you want some room to hangout and enjoy a drink together.  Between the wait and the epic portions of heavy, albeit delicious food, I don't frequent Fat Head's that much. The few times I do crave it, it's just not worth the wait. It's probably worth the wait once, but after you experience it, you'll find the appeal drops off a bit. Especially when I can get quality sandwiches that won't leave me feeling like a bloated whale, as well as an excellent pint from a great, albeit smaller, beer menu close by (Piper's Pub is a quick walk across the street).  So in the end, check it out, bring your appetite, and plan to wait if you're stopping in during peak times. You'll be glad you did...at least once.",

These massive sandwiches are topped with the tastiest of ingredients-kielbasa, pierogis, bacon, sausage, and fried eggs to name a few.  I tried The Bender, Beercamp, and Southside Slopes and all were fantastic-but if I had to chose just one it would be The Bender.  Their wings are also really good and meaty and their sauces are so good we considered buying some to bring home-their Original has just the perfect amount of heat to make you sweat a little, but not sear off your taste buds.  If the food wasn't enough, their beer selection is fantastic.  I tried the Southern Tier Pumking beer and it tasted like a vanilla candle smells, if that makes any sense.  Not an overpowering pumpkin flavor, with vanilla and cinnamon notes to really make it stand out.  This place is super packed at night.  We went for lunch around noon on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all-I think that's the way to go, our hotel's shuttle driver told us the wait for food could be about 4 hours on weekend nights-crazy, but after tasting their food, I would consider it worth it!",

I chose Fat Heads because they are considered one of the best burger spots in Pitt. It took about 30 minutes to find parking in this area and once I put my name in for a table of eight, it was an hour wait. We decided to hang out at the bar and get some beers while we wait. I decided to get a pint of their brewed Christmas Ale, which was delicious. One of my friends like it as well.  Once we finally got a table, we ordered two plates of buffalo wings. However, I only ate one because I wanted to save room for dinner. I thought the wing was okay and needed more sauce.  We were surprised how big the burgers were when we saw another table's orders came in. I decided to get the Smoky burger medium well which had provolone cheese, smoky bbq sauce, bacon, and onion crisps. I loved it and the french fries were excellent as well. For dinner, I decided to get a pint of Great Lakes Elliot Ness lager, a sweet caramel lager. I thought it was great along with my burger.One of my friends ordered a steak salad and that was huge. Everyone thought this restaurant was great and they have a large selection of beers.  if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I want to come back again!",

    "text": "Everything I have eaten has been great!  Here's some pros and cons:  Pros: GIANT beer selection GIANT sandwiches Comfortable casual atmosphere Cool decor Has own little souvenir/beer shop upstairs Relatively large amount of parking - street and a public lot right across from the restaurant Staff knowledgable about the drinks and food  Cons: In winter time, sitting in the front dining room is BRUTAL.  Very cold, large snaps of cold air blowing in on you and your food every time someone opens the door.  Would be nice to have a double door system installed. Pepperoni rolls are a joke - I've loved all the food, but we ordered these as an appetizer and all you get are two small ones!  Kindof hard to share amongst more than two people.  They were still tasty, but they could afford to throw a few more rolls on that plate for how much they cost.  Overall, one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh.  If they fixed the cold snap issue I'd probably give 5 stars.",

    "text": "It's \"just bar food\" but it's among the most perfect rendition of bar food you could ever hope for. Huge portions expertly crafted. The staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The beer selection must be mentioned because it's second to none on Carson. The beer menu that accompanies every table demonstrates that getting you the right beer is a priority here. Dozens of styles and a wide variety of breweries are available, asking for a sample is never looked down upon, and the bartenders are happy to direct you towards something based on your taste desires.   The best compliment I can give Fat Heads is this: I'm born and raised in Pittsburgh but I moved to Philadelphia for 3 years. After months of trying I never found anything to satisfy my bar food cravings in the way Fat Heads always does. So after eventually giving up I started driving 5 hours back to Pittsburgh once a month to treat myself to Fat Heads food, staff, and beers. I never regretted it, even during epic blizzards. Having moved back home I'm now here at least once a week and if I were ever on death row a soft pretzel and a Quadruple Bypass burger from here would be my final meal.",

    "text": "I took my out of town friends here this past Friday for a late dinner and to have a couple drinks since Fathead's can be seen as a popular Pittsburgh landmark.   Since we were a party of 7, I decided to call ahead of time to make a reservation but they do not accept reservations via phone. Instead I was instructed to use the app No Wait, however the app does not let you make reservations for that amount so I had to call back and discuss this with the hostess. It was not handled until we were actually in the restaurant, but we actually ended up only waiting about 20-30 minutes to be seated.   We grabbed drinks from the bar while we waited. They have a great selection of beer that is not only their own, but also various kinds from other breweries. I had the ever so popular Bumbleberry beer and it was crisp and refreshing. The blueberries in the beer were a nice added touch!  Our waitress was polite, attentive, friendly, and prompt. I have zero complaints about the service!  I ordered the Bumbleberry Chicken Salad and it was absolutely delicious. The bed of arugula was a rather large serving underneath a nice amount of chicken, blueberries, and goat cheese. The dressing was unique. It had a yogurt consistency with hints of blueberry and poppyseed in it. Very good!  A $20 price tag was appropriate for a salad and beer in the heart of the Southside.   All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and everyone enjoyed themselves. The only reason for a 4/5 opposed to a 5/5 was due to the reservation fiasco in the beginning. For a large and busy restaurant I feel like reservations are a must for large parties and it was not the easiest task here.",

I had the triple bypass burger just because it's a Pittsburgh tradition to buy the biggest and messiest sandwiches. Gal pals had the South Side Slope and the Kelsey burger which both were awesome. My burger had a strong kick to it that was a little over powering for my taste. I like when the heat adds to the flavor not hides it. But the burger and brisket were so good! Buns are thick and alrighty dry.   They make homemade chips and fries too! We got both and I personally loved the fries. Dip them in ketchup or cheddar ((yum yum))  Only complaint is that the heat on my burger needed to go down a notch or two   Server was polite and focused for how busy he was on a Friday night!",

I went there last Sunday, having not gone in a while, and expecting it to be not as good as I had remembered. I was completely wrong.  I love spicy food. So for me, the bay of pigs sandwich was a perfect choice. It is Fat Head's version of a cuban sandwich with ham, pulled pork, mustard and pickles. However, they switch it up by adding their killer hot sauce on there that has just the right amount of heat to make anyone develop just a little bit of sweat above the brow.  Why only three stars? For starters, the wait staff has never been top notch. I have never gone into Fat Head's expecting good service. It is slow and the staff always seems to be overwhelmed. Also, only burgers come with fries. Everything else comes with chips. I love fresh, salty chips but the chips they give you are lacking any substantial seasoning.",

This is how I once accidentally picked out a $75 6-pack, but mother of god were those fancy Belgian beers AMAZING!  The food is FAMOUS.  Its my opinion that Fat Head's has the best reuben in town, and you may disagree and that's fine bc you are totally entitled to your wrong opinion.  The Headwiches are True \"man food.\"  Chicks like them too but they are basketball sandwiches full of meat and love and calories and they are insanely good.  That said aside from the reuben my other favorite menu item is the Beach Burger bc its just a straight forward, really good hamburger.  You've just got to try this place if you haven't been here.

After eating the Southside Slopes sandwich from Fat Heads, I kind of feel like Pittsburgh might not be such a bad place to live.  And this is coming from a Browns fan.  My Cleveland area family were always talking about Pierogi's when I was younger, but it just seemed like a food with a funny name to me.  As I grew older, I always wanted to try them, but they aren't exactly a popular item down here in Florida.  I cannot think of a better first-time Pierogi experience than this sandwich.  I don't think I have had a better sandwich in my life.  Every bite of it was more heavenly than the last.  And eventually...it was gone.  That was the only part that sucked - it ended.

All of the options are loaded with different combinations of vegetables or fill-ins. Everything is fresh and full of flavor, including the meats. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. Their chips for sandwiches / fries for burgers policy is a bit strict though, as they allow no substitutions. I like their house-made chips more so I wish this weren't the case, but I appreciate that they're clear about it on their menu.",

She came back constantly to check on us, and brought our food and drinks out in a timely fashion.   We ordered a bunch of things and left with a lot of leftover. We split 2 soft pretzels(obviously not homemade but delicious none-the-less) and the fried pierogis. Both were tasty! For entrees my sister had the deluxe veggie burger and enjoyed it. My fiance had the t-bone and ate the entire thing. My older sister had a half rack of ribs and a few garlic Parm wings are they were both delicious! I ordered the Jack-o headwich and it was spicy and delicious! Huuuuuge portion and the homemade chips were to die for. I loved it, and my brother-in-law enjoyed the rest when we got home!

Regardless of what you order for dinner, you MUST TRY THE WHOLE WINGS! They are amazing and I've never had anything else like them. The bar has an extensive beer list with some of Fat Heads' own brands being the best options on tap in the house. I recommend the Bumble Berry (it's served with a few blueberries floating on top).   We used to live in the Southside and would frequent Fat heads often. Since moving to the suburbs, we regularly make the trip into the city to get our Fat Heads fix. It's also my parents' favorite spot to visit when they're in town.   Definitely use the No Wait app to find a seat if you're stopping in on a weekend night. This place is popular!",

The bread, however, absolutely stinks. Reminds me of the pack of white bread buns you pick up at a convenience store.",

Our food came out before our beer which was only in about 5 mins. My cauliflower wasn't good at all it tasted like it was still raw it was very hard and it was drenched in oil. I was really disappointed it looked really good but didn't taste good it needed to be fried longer. The fresh homemade chips that came with the sandwich were not fresh they were not even warm. Since our food came out in 5 mins (faster than our beer ) it makes me think it wasn't fresh it was a mess up or something and they just brought it to our table because the restaurant was busy and the food definitely didn't taste like it was just made.",

The burger had the perfect amount of blue cheese on it, not too overwhelming, as well as just enough hot sauce to give it a bit of a kick. The onion straws and bacon on the burger were nice and crispy, adding a crunch with each bite. My bun tasted a bit stale, but I was able to peel off the top bread layer and still enjoy my meal. With every burger they give you a huge amount of fries, which is more than you need, but they're delicious and great for sharing. As far as drinks, they have a big list of their branded draft beers. The Bumble Berry is by far my favorite! It's smooth, not too hoppy, and has a hit of blueberry.   Service here was excellent. We got seated right away and our waiter brought us water glasses within minutes. Both our burgers came out in a reasonable amount of time, even with them being busy on a Friday night. The waiter checked on us a few times throughout our meal, but also gave us time to relax, talk, and enjoy our meals. I will definitely be coming back here again!",

The atmosphere is super casual. Loud noise levels.   Ordered frickles ($9), Southside slopes ($13) and beauty & the beastie ($12) headwiches.   Frickles came with two sauces, Honey mustard (sweet and creamy) and Sriracha Thousand Island (spicier than expected, couldn't eat!). Tasty batter, although the proportion of it to the pickle was 3:1. Still, pretty delicious. Watch out, as all the fried coating will fill you up quickly and you won't be able to enjoy the reason why people come here for--the headwiches.  Southside slopes: chargrilled kielbasa topped with sauteed pierogi and onions, American cheese, horseradish sauce. Solid. Only one pierogi inside, and pretty tough dough, so watch out.   Beauty & the beastie: house-smoked pulled pork, Beasty BBQ (got substituted for regualar BBQ, as I don't handle spicy too well), pickles, onions, slaw. This was underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high from all the hype that I've heard about this. The reality was very plain and not very satisfying. Bland, fatty pulled pork with barely any sauce, not enough cole slaw. The bun itself is huge, but there's much less filling inside than you expect.   Headwiches come with house-made chips. Those were my favorite part of the meal. Enormous, thin, golden, light, and perfectly crunchy. Need more salt, but you can always sprinkle some from the salt shaker on your table. Really enjoyed these crisps and will miss them every time I eat chips again.  Not the best sandwiches I've ever had, but an interesting local Pittsburgh experience.",

It could be due to my continued occupation in Pittsburgh that has reduced my expectations for good food, or it might just be that Fat Heads is a great spot for Pittsburgh fare!   They are home to several interesting and memorable brews such as the bumble berry (served with fresh, floating blueberries) and the headhunter (a solid IPA).   The portions here are enormous! Even though they don't use the best ingredients for the dishes, the entrees are still spectacular to look at due to their massive sizes and for that reason, you can never really be disappointed.

I did however really enjoy the Guns and Roses Rose beer which was delicious. Their bumble berry is always fresh and a hit as well. We ordered chips and beer cheese as an appetizer which was very good. Took some time to come out though. I got the spicy parm wings and they were fantastic-not too spicy but just right!

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this for awhile, especially given this is the original location. The three of us stopped in on a Monday evening around 8:30 pm. The hostess was apparently too busy to acknowledge us or another pair of patrons, blatantly ignoring us without politely advising it would be another minute or so before they could take down our names. I dismissed this as it being a Monday night and on some days, you're bound to get the \"B\" team of apathetic millennials  who have a skewed view of customer service. We were told the wait would be around 15 minutes. We went to the bar to wait and as each ten minute interval passed (10, 20, 40 min) we saw tables get cleared but no patrons being sat. After 45 minutes I approached the four hostesses at the counter doing nothing but playing on their phones and asked if they had an ETA as I saw a few booths empty. We were immediately sat but no recognition or apology was given. We ordered appetizers and entrees. Drinks were brought out quickly once ordered, but food took more than half an hour to arrive at the tables and all of our appetizers and entrees were dropped off at the same time. Our waitress apologized for that - she was the best part of the evening.   My steak sandwich was dry, but all the other food (wings, pierogies, other sandwiches) were very good.   The weirdest part of the night was that my friend lost his keys and asked one of the bus boys if he had any turned over to him, who said yes he had them but refused to show them to my friend. We are a group of 30 year old professionals so it was odd to be treated like criminals. We eventually found his keys in my car but the entire exchange was off-putting.  Based on the poor service, I will not patronize this location anymore.",

I had a blueberry infused beer, it wasn't too sweet and had a nice crisp flavor. I got an order of the fathead wings and it offered a nice kick. The wings were cooked well and has a great texture.  We were seated near the bar but the bar and restaurant areas were still pretty separated which was nice.  Even though it was busy I didn't feel rushed and the waiter was extremely helpful about choosing a beer from the expansive beer menu.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'll have to stop by again.",

    "text": "Absolutely our FAVORITE place to get a sandwich and a beer in Pittsburgh.  Once we discovered Fathead's, a lot of other places in Southside never saw our faces again.  They easily have the best beer selection in Southside, and the signature sandwiches are otherworldly.  My new favorite is called \"The Angry Cheese Steak.\"  My son is a big fan of the outrageous \"Fuddwich.\"  It's always a dilemma deciding what to order, and we frequently get on the trolley to Southside just so we can enjoy a couple more of the beers served from their 42 taps without having to worry about driving home.  Service is EXCELLENT, and there is outdoor seating for those who enjoy watching the freak show walking down Carson Street!",

    "text": "If you're thinking about eating healthy do NOT go to Fatheads.  Healthy and Fatheads are polar opposites of each other, but if you're in the mood for some awesome bar food then head on over!    Our group ordered the nachos to share - wow it was a huge portion.  Word of warning to tortilla fans - they do not use tortilla chips in their nachos, but potato chips.  I was pleasantly surprised by the use of chips and they had so many toppings on the nachos, my taste buds were dancing around like little fairies.  Happy fairies for sure.  They nachos had beef, an overabundance of jalapenos (yay), lettuce, black olives, of course cheese, and a whopping dollop of sour cream on top (I'm not a huge sour cream fan, but you can avoid it if you wanted to).    For my meal, I had the Hoff-wich (it's a wrap).  Do not confuse this with David Hasslehoff in any way - apparently it's named after one of the employees at Fatheads.  We mistakenly made a comment on the name of the wrap and The Hoff (David that is) and was quickly put in our place by the employee who the sandwich was named after (ouch!).  Let's be clear, there's no shame in naming a sandwich after the original Hoff.    The wrap was very tasty.  It had enough spiciness to keep me salivating but was toned down by the chipotle mayo.  Also just a note about the mayo, it's more like a cream cheese consistency not really like mayo.  Again, not a huge fan of creamy stuff like cream cheese (and as mentioned above sour cream) but it worked for this wrap.  So it was grilled chicken, Fathead's original sauce, lettuce, black olives, bacon, and chipotle mayo.  *slurp - sorry I had to wipe my face from drooling.    For a beer, I had the Anderson Valley Winter Solstice - talk about a taste of the season.  Highly recommend as it's a great winter beer.    Fathead's lets be unhealthy together forever!",

This place has a formulaic feel like TGI Fridays, but it's forgivable because they only have one more location (in Cleveland, a town the locals loves to hate).   The menus are fun to read and if the portions weren't so damn big, I'd get wings and fries too. Great bar food, great beer. No wait, outstanding food and beer.

Several of my favorite sandwiches are no longer on the menu. I'm devastated that the steak and bacon club is gone! I ordered one of the new brisket sandwiches and it was okay, but nowhere near as good as what used to be on the menu. My girlfriend ordered one of the new sandwiches as well and she hated it. Wings are still great, and so is the beer. But it's just not the same anymore. Sad to say, but I don't see myself coming here as often as I used to. I recommend piper's pub across the street.",

These are facts that are only relevant to me. Anyway, we got here at about 4:00 on a Wednesday and it was no problem getting a seat. I hear it does get very busy though.  They have a huge selection of beers, including some from my home state Michigan (Bell's). Cool. They also have Miller Lite if you feel like getting verbally insulted.   The food is definitely huge. I got a sandwich with an egg on it, and my accompanyment got a burger with a perogie on top. Perogies, of course, being the official topping of Pittsburgh. Both sandwiches had the right amount of moisture, but it was too much for one sitting. They also come with sides of either fresh potato chips, or fresh french fries. Good stuff.  Overall, this is a good place to stop by if you're very hungry or want a decent beer. Or a heart attack.",

    "text": "Stopped in with Classy Mike (and our Pittsburgh-resident friend, Mr. Matt-bot) on the first stop of our New York to Los Angeles road trip.  Though we'd obviously be eating out every day of the road trip, Classy Mike and I set the goal to not gorge ourselves until we got to San Francisco.  So, like total idiots and hypocrites, we came to Fat Heads on our first night.  (For those unacquainted, bring Classy Mike to a place like Fat Heads to finally get the answer to the question, \"Do you need THAT MANY chicken wings?\")  Fat Heads is obviously positioning themselves to capture the vibe of Fridays/Chili's while offering better food and a better beer selection.  On that, they clearly succeed (on all counts - it is LOUD in there, uncomfortably so).    They've chosen to go the \"Society is looking for healthy food, so we'll ironically just position ourselves as incredibly unhealthy and a place to get a giant fatty sandwich\" marketing route.  I had the aptly named \"Mighty Fine Bovine\", featuring both brisket and pastrami.  Perhaps, though,  the Fridays-esque nature of the restaurant naturally lowered my expectations.  But I thought it was pretty good - oddly, the sandwich didn't come with that much meat, but a huge amount of bread.  As someone who prefers smaller portions and generally tosses most of the bread, that was fine with me.  But I could see some, ah, fat heads, being perturbed at that.   Also, the wings were solid.  I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the menu notes that the sandwiches come with homemade chips, and that you can't substitute them, because they take a lot of hard work.  Therefore, it continues, you should think that you're paying for the sandwich and getting the chips for free.  But this is stubbornly arbitrary - you can't take one part of a package that you're paying a flat fee for and say that it's not what you're paying for.  Ugh.  Food: 17/25 stars Ambiance: 9/25 stars Service: 14/25 stars Bathroom: 18/25 stars Probability of going back: 50%",

I would say that I had been here about 20 or so times before but somehow my father, a native born Pittsburgher, never has.  We arrived at the restaurant in the midst of the lunch rush as was evident by the three takeout orders that people paid for in front of us.  Once the hostess took care of them we were seated in the dining room.  The inside of Fat Heads looks much like you would imagine a sports bar to look like with a number of TV's all over the place, a bar and then an area behind the bar where they have a list of beers that they have on draft (42 according to their website).  For lunch I decided to have the mighty fine bovine headwich since I have never had that particular headwich before.  It consisted of smoked brisket, pastrami, swiss cheese, hot pepper kraut, onion, pickles and garlic-parm mayo all on a huge bun (the menu claims almost as big as your head and I believe it) that has two olives poked into it to make it look like eyes.  My headwich came with a side of homemade potato chips and ended up being really good as most of their sandwiches are.  I really enjoyed the brisket and pastrami and only wish there was a little more hot pepper kraut and mayo in order to make the sandwich a little less dry and a little spicier.  Even with my headwich being somewhat dry, I still really enjoyed it and my father told me that he enjoyed his steak and hot sausage sub as well.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  I absolutely love their sandwiches and next time I will hopefully not be on my lunch hour and so able to imbibe one of their many beers!",

A girlfriend and I decided to do an early dinner dine here because of the fact it would be too busy any later. We were sat outside. The weather was a little chilly and it was drizzling, however the heaters on the ceiling did their jobs and we stayed dry and warm.  The server introduced herself right away and got our drink order. We ordered the fat heads dumble berry beer. Which was served with blueberries (cute). It had a hint of berry and honey. The server checked in on us 2 more times before we finally decided our food order. Everything on the menu looked.. Read great!.. The smell of other tables burgers made it that much harder to choose. We decided on the brisket salad and the jack-o burger. The salad was huge! The brisket was thinly sliced. The salad also had fried onions, a small hard boiled egg roasted red peppers and banana peppers. It also has blue cheese crumbs, but I ordered mine without. Tossed in a Dijon vinegarette that gave it a nice spice/kick! I enjoyed this salad very much! The burger was a tender steak(an actual steak!), roasted red pepper, sharp cheddar, onion rings and a very very killer ranch on a thick but not overwhelming bun. This is a spicy burger. We love spicy, and are very used to spicy and this burger was very spicy! So if you can not handle too much of spice this is not for you! The service was attentive. The server knew her menu and everything we asked about she knew. The atmosphere was comfortable. The prices were not very expensive. Good eat. Good drink.",

Consistently keeping their tap selection updated and rotated, and supplying their customer with ample choices for eats, Fat Heads has one of the best atmospheres for the foodie. We've been regulars at this location for 15 years.  I've never been served by a waiter or waitress who didn't know the full menu or draft list. Service is ALWAYS timely, and the staff is hilarious - real people.  I call this the best burger in town, cooked to preference, and daunting in size. If you do get a burger, it will come with a side of fries. Order the honey mustard on the side! It's got a kick!  I am sad that they don't do the Wall of Fame anymore, but it's only because the customer base got too big! Way to go, Fat Heads!",

I was in the mood for a good meal before starting our springtime Sunday Funday.  As many times as I've been here to just drink, I've never tried their food.  At first I thought I wanted a burger, but I saw they had a salmon Caesar salad on the menu and decided to go for that instead.  While it was good....big mistake.  Bobby ordered the something blue (?) burger and let me try a bite which turned into finishing the rest of what he wasn't going to eat...and some fries and cheese.  This is not somewhere you go to try to stick to your diet!!!!  I could do without the bread because the toppings alone added so much to it.  My salmon salad was large with a generous amount of dressing and the fish cooked well, although the salmon was smoked I believe and if I had the option, would've just ordered it grilled or baked.  It wasn't super busy, lots of families with kids were seated around us.  We ordered their miller lite draft and bumble berry beers.  Good - to be expected.  Service was quick and friendly, not invasive. I like this place.",

    "text": "My sandwich adventure continued in Pittsburgh when a couple of colleagues based out here suggested Fat Heads Saloon. Upon entering you're welcomed to their little souvenir shop where they sell shirts, shot and cognac glasses (I purchased a cognac and shot glass to bring back to NY). You probably will also notice that the restaurant is a lot larger than you would think.   For my appetizer I had the arrogant onion rings. Wow, they battered extremely well. So much so, that I have never had a batch of onion rings where the batter did not stray away from the onion. Plus, they were spicy which I enjoyed immensely.   For my entree, I decided on getting Nicole's original cheese steak which came with homemade chips. The sandwich was very filling, the bread was just the right consistency and I enjoyed every single bite. The chips were decent. My only issue with them was that they seasoned only the top chips with salt, so once you cleared the top chips you basically only had potato flavored chips.   Outside of that, I would definitely visit again if I am in the area.",

My sandwiches have always been good but nothing I couldn't make myself for cheaper. Apps are great here. The homemade chips that come with the meal are always too greasy or burnt. Not great. The veggie burger is down right gross and somewhat insulting to vegetarians (not sure if vegan). It can be hard to find options when not eating meat and the veggie option isn't good. Beer selection is great and obviously fat heads is quite good.  My main issue with this place is the service/staff. Multiple times staff has been rude to us or ignored us. Slow service I can't understand during busy times but when it's hardly crowded-- It doesn't make sense. I'll probably end back up here someone but not my first choice for food when Southside has soooo many great options .",

Never stopped coming in after that.  Beefed up is our fav. Brisket, roast beef, tomato and lettuce, headhunter mustard, pickled pepper rings on a crusty bun, a side of chips and we have to have Beasty BBQ sauce for dipping. Oh my goodness. Heaven in the Southside. Seriously, everything on the menu rocks but still. Smoked wings are decent, the potato chip nachos are yum.  Other reviews rave about the burgers. I guess you see this place is great.  The updated bar is so open that it's a pleasure to comfortably enjoy the brews. We like the 'friends' (other breweries) but their own brews are diverse, fresh and thirst quenching.  Tori, bartender, is very knowledgeable, friendly, interesting and fun to know. A True asset.   We left with full tummies, a six-pack and a jar of the mustard.  That's a good afternoon.   The new interior and exterior update is awesome and a real asset. Breezy, not cramped, and customer friendly.",

We went around dinner time on a Saturday so the place was packed and we had to leave our name. But they texted us when our table was ready so we were able to go to a bar next door and grab a drink. We didn't wait too long either despite having a pretty big group of us.   Once seated we were waited on quickly and able to put beers in. I got the Bumbleberry of course and it came with fresh blueberries. It was delicious and refreshing as always. We decided to order nachos with chicken to start. The chicken on the nachos was underwhelming. It was like, strips rather than shredded and all just thrown in the middle. There wasn't a lot of it either, otherwise though, they were decent nachos. For my main entree I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Cheesesteak. It was very flavorful and delicious. It definitely made up for the nachos, I would get it again.   Overall, I would visit Fat Heads again and it's worth the visit if you're in Southside and looking to grab some dinner.",

I had 5 whole wings for $11 and a pint sized vodka cran for $8.  The wings were a bit over cooked but they were meaty and filling. Service was a bit slow but it's a busy place and I imagine the bar is even busier.  Definitely one of the better places in Southside!",

They even brew their own signature beers in-house (the ones I've tried being very delicious!). Their food, too, is incredible. Fat Heads is called Fat Heads for a reason. Their portion sizes are extremely generous with a category of their menu even being called \"Headwiches\" due to the sandwich being the size of one's head. It's a great atmosphere with a lively waitstaff! I always have a good time, and I'd recommend Fat Heads to anyone!",

I ordered the black bean burger and I really enjoyed it.  The burgers come with fries, the sandwiches come with chips. The rest of my party were initially a little disappointed that theirs did not come with fries, but after tasting the chips,  they were over it!  Everyone loved their sandwich or burger.  The fries were also good.  (If you love ranch dressing, order some in the side, theirs is really good)  Of course you have to mention their beer when reviewing .  A huge selection to satisfy anyones  beer preference .  Tip:  I believe they are on the no wait app. We went at 3 pm on a Saturday and it was packed.",

There were eight of us in our party and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad at all considering the amount of people in our group. However there isn't really a great waiting area so we just kinda stood near the hostess desk feeling like we were in the way.   Once we were seated we had a chance to look at the drink menu. I love fat heads beer! They have a pretty great list of their own beer and some other brands and ciders as well. My go to beers form this brewery is definitely the bumble berry-a blueberry beer- and the IPA head hunter. They also have great seasonal beers.  I ordered the Pittsburgh salad. It was huge-like most of fat heads dishes. It was packed with ingredients and topped off with French fries. It was delicious but probably one of the most unhealthy salads I've ever had.   Everyone was satisfied with their meals however our service was a little slow. While our server was really friendly it was hard to find her and our drink and water sat empty for long periods of time of multiple occasions but it seemed like it was busy and maybe understaffed so it wasn't a big deal.  I definitely recommend coming here! Just be warned the portions are ginormous!",

I ordered the sliced steak sammy with egg which was good but heart stopping and had a taste of the cuban which was even more delicious.  The cuban which stood out to me was quite spicey for all you spice lovers out there.  Quantity wise the sandwiches were more than enough for a big eater like myself, so no worries there.  Oh and who can forget one of my favorite parts of the meal...the home made potato chips!  They were the perfect mix of soggy and crispy.  And yah, i did say soggy!  For some reason even the texture of the soggy chips still complimented the meal.  All in all Fatheads is a great place for food drinks and fun, enjoy!",

Do not eat here if you are on a diet. There is literally nothing on the menu that could be classified as healthy. It was one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in awhile.  Had the \"Original Chicken Sub\".  My boyfriend had the \"Beauty and the Beast\" and I swear he talked about it for 2 days. I think he is going to dump me for the sandwich.  Good waiter, not obtrusive or annoying at all, very reasonably priced. Between 8-14 for a sandwich/sub with homemade chips. Definitely will be back.",

The salad was served in the exact same bowl my family and I use to serve salad at Thanksgiving dinner NO JOKE! It was filled to the brim with salad covered in tons of cheese, too much dressing, and less than extraordinary chicken.   So basically I had 3-5 bites and was done just because I was so grossed out. I wish the server would have mentioned the salad was big enough to feed the whole table and the one next to us. But he just completely ignored the fact I didn't eat any of it.

Located deep in the heart of South Side, it's a great way to start a day of adventuring and checking out the Pittsburgh scene. It gets VERY busy on Saturday and Sundays, so waiting is going to be inevitable no matter what time you decide to go. However, you can have a seat at the bar while you wait, and it's usually not longer than 30 to 45 minutes. In the meantime, the atmosphere is a very sports themed, and the time will fly while you wait.",

NO apology, NO drop by from a manager to try and ameliorate the situation.  I would not suggest this shithole to anyone under any circumstances.  Complete amateur hour operation.",

We had 4 different orders of 10 wings, and tried their Honey Chipotle, Spicy Parmesan, the Fat Head Original and Jalapeno Chedder. It was a unanimous vote that we all LOVED their Spicy Parmesan wings; so different and SOOO good!!! The rest of the sauces, however, were very average.   Then, my fiance and I ordered the famous Southside Slope Headwich, which is supposedly voted the #5 Best Sandwich in the US. When we got our sandwich, we were so glad that it was ordered to share cuz the portion was HUGE. And honestly, one of the BEST sandwiches we've had and that's probably because we liked everything in there: fried pierogies, kielbasa, American cheese, grilled onion, and horsey sauce.  YUM YUM YUM!  Note that the sandwich also came with fried chips, which were okay but you'll have to have a pretty big appetite to still eat them after that Headwich! lol  PS: We also ordered their signature wheat draft and that was very good as well. This place is a must try when visiting Pitt and we hope to be back again in the future!",

My husband gets the same sandwich every time we come a PCI.  They have great appetizers such as wings, nachos, bread mushrooms, and pepperoni rolls.  I have gotten several of the sandwiches and they have all been great.  Some of the sandwiches are only things you could think of in a dream of putting together.  When you see them on the menu you may actually want to do a happy dance because you have found your perfect sandwich you have been dreaming about your entire life.  They are huge and I have come to learn that I can really only eat half and should take the rest home.  It is great though the next day too for lunch.  Their salads are huge and very tasty such as the steak salad.    The only con I have had is getting some items with BBQ sauce and the sauce was too spicy for me.  Some of my friends enjoy the Sauce but I am not a fan of spicy items.",

    "text": "Worth the wait! Fat Heads is going to be at least a half-hour wait at just about any time of the day (peak time is closer to 2 hours), but don't skip off to somewhere with a shorter line or else you'll regret it! Located in the Southside of Pittsburgh, Fat Heads is a staple to any tourists must-try restaurants of Pittsburgh. Parking can sometimes be a bear; it's street or a small pay lot across the street.  Fat Heads has a great selection of food. From salads to burgers to wings to nachos, Fat Heads has something for everyone. Their menu probably lists close to 70 items (not an exaggeration); it always takes me forever to choose. I personally am a fan of their Quadruple Bypass Burger. Imagine a massive hamburger topped with cheddar cheese, beef brisket, bacon, and a fried egg...Delicious! (Please have a healthy heart before indulging) For a healthier choice, the Fiery Chicken sandwich is excellent, as well as any of their humongous salad bowls. If you cannot find something you like on Fat Heads' menu, you must be in the mood for Chinese or Thai because that's just about the only things they don't have. The portion size is honestly double any other restaurant. They call their sandwiches \"Headwiches\" because, no lie, they are the size of your head. My favorite appetizer is Pedro's Nachos, but beware, the dish is massive. Do not order for just two people because you won't get close to finishing and you'll be full before your giant dinners even hit the table. I've seen tables of 4 split nachos as their meal, that's how piled high these nachos are! For a more modest sized appetizer, try their wings. Select one of their delicious sauces, like Chipotle Honey.  Fat Heads' beer selection is all prestigious. I wanna say they have close to 40 beers on tap all of the time. Once again, any type of beer you can think of, they have it. My personal favorite is the blueberry beer.  You must go to Fat Heads hungry!  So, overall, I give Fat Heads' all five stars (I would've given 6, but the wait time is always long). My fiance and I usually get out of there for ~$30 with an appetizer and two burgers. Try the burgers, the wings, or, if you're feeling extra hungry, the nachos, and you won't be disappointed.",

A bar with beer options from all over is my kind of place.  I got Bell's Oberon, one of my favorite beers and with one sample sip, the rest of my crew got the same.  I love to spread my love for Bell's around.  Anyways, we were seated and began to read their extensive menu.  Dear lord there were so many ways to die.  We ordered the nachos to start.  The potato should be the official vegetable of Pittsburgh (and yes, I know potatoes are not really a vegetable).  Since Fat Heads makes their own chips, they build their nachos on potato chips instead of tortilla.  Why are more people not doing this?  These were the best nachos I ever ate.    My lady friend and I decided to split the Southside Slopes sandwich.  The gents ordered the steak sandwich and the Quadruple Bypass burger.  From what I can tell, both were super happy with their choice since they both polished off their meals (and won my heart by doing so).  The Southside Slopes won a place on Maxim's best sandwiches list and I know why.  I have had many a food coma, but I have never been drunk from food and this is what that sandwich did to me.  I literally was buzzing from my half of sandwich, which is a bun with kielbasa, pierogies, grilled onions, and cheese with horseradish sauce.  I am either sad or glad this place is 5 hours away from me.  I can't decide.  I do know if I have to die from a meal, I will pick Fat Heads as my way out.  I am so happy to have ended my trip here.  This is a definite must for any visitor or local alike.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved it! When a friend came to town that used to live in the area, they insisted we go to Fat Heads. I couldnt believe how great it was even with people packed in everywhere!   With an allergy to beer, I thought I would have a hard time liking the place given the place is known for their microbrews and huge selection of beers from everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised with a selection of draft cider that was amazing! We hung out at the bar having drinks until the table was ready and the bartender kept us entertained leaving us feeling like it was the shortest hour wait ever.  The food was fantastic! Enough for a couple meals and cheap! It was a delicious combo and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their food as much as we enjoyed ours.   I can't wait to go back and have decided to make sure to take any other friends that visit to Fat Heads!",

Fat Heads also has the offers a club for those who try their beers, an incentive to get out of your comfort zone and try some new brews.",

I kinda wish that I could come back here enough times to try all of them, but I'm concerned that I would suffer heart failure before I could finish.  For example, my sandwich was a kielbasa sausage, topped with fried pierogies, along with cheese, horseradish sauce, among other toppings.  Delicoius? Absolutely.  Healthy?  Far from it!    I will say that I was a bit disappointed in the fries, and I was also a bit disappointed that they were sold out of their house-brewed beer.    If you are in Pittsburgh for a few days, I feel like you are obligated to give Fat Heads a try--although I'd recommend going for dinner (or a liquid lunch) so you can try their award winning beer!",

You are not allowed to call ahead of time and then show up, you must actually put your name in at the door. Certainly, the wait sucks, but South Side is a very neat place to stroll through and the food makes up for the line.  Every time I go here I eat almost to the point of discomfort. The food is too delicious to leave unfinished on your plate. I am fairly certain that I've never ordered the same sandwich twice and they have all been very good. Personally, I would recommend anything on the menu.  The appetizers are also very tasty. I like the beer mussels, which are mussels cooked in beer and topped with salsa.  When I come out of this place, I feel like I am 8 months pregnant with food twins. Thank goodness for the nearby bus stop, where I can just sit down and wait to be taken back to Oakland. The only bad part is that after eating it is a race between the bus and nature's call.",

    "text": "I heard a lot about this place from coworkers while I was in Pittsburgh and I had high expectations, unfortunately I left unimpressed. To me it felt like the restaurant used the gimmick of \"giant\" sandwiches to lure people in. It does not matter how big the sandwich is if the taste is below average. The service was much better than the food.  For starters my party had the fried mushrooms and parm wings. The wings were excellent which is what saved this restaurant from a 1 star review. The fried mushrooms were huge but lacked flavor. The breading had no taste what so ever. For the meal I had their version of a Cuban. The sandwich was served on a giant hamburger bun and had ham, cheese, pickles, pulled pork, and a spicy sauce. First of all a cuban cannot be served on a hamburger bun, just something wrong with that. Much of the flavor of a cuban comes from using the right bread. Secondly, the pulled pork was awful. Extremely dry and tasteless. I ended up pulling most of it off. It was served with fries which were unsalted, and you guessed it, completely flavorless. This was by far the worst \"cuban\" I have ever had. I ate half and threw the rest away.   I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. You can get much better sandwiches at other places in Pittsburgh.",

By the time you're done eating, you will be covered in so much red, dripping effluence, that you will look like a zombie from 28 Days Later.  It's a damn viking feast every time we're in there.    The food is sloppy, but good, and if you've committed to coming here, I would avoid the salads.  That's like going to hell to get a tan.  This place is famous for it's unbelievably large burgers and sandwiches.  They are in no way haute cuisine, but instead rely on the basest of delicious ingredients to make them stand out.  The amount of sodium you ingest is around the salt level of one of the smaller oceans, and that's just for the wings.  They have their own beer, and an impressive beer list on top of that.  You will leave here feeling like that guy from the Monty Python sketch, so don't accept any mints, because you will fucking explode.  Waitstaff has always been very efficient considering the amount of people in the place.

The tables are pretty small (see pictures), and with the amount of food, it gets tight, but never uncomfortable. Service after we got seated was really efficient.  DRINKS: HUGE selection.. you name it.. They have a rotating list and if you get a frequent drinker card, you get different perks depending on the amount of different beers you try.  FOOD: VERY noms. Portions are generous, tasted absolutely great, wide selection, and it all even looks good! There are a dozen different level of spiciness for the wings, but if you order the killer sauce make sure you can handle it first. It hurts.   The atmosphere was great, and I don't think there was anything too \"touristy\" about it. A lot are regs, and the prices were reasonable. Can't wait to go back!!!",

It is definitely a popular spot for locals, as we had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  However, that was not a big deal.  I had a pint of the Headhunter IPA, which is one of their own micro-brews.  It was above average in quality.  For a meal, I had the Southside Slopes headwich, which is served with 'fancy' potato chips.  The chips were mediocre (so I would've preferred the fries, which looked really good), but the headwich was decent.  It filled me up, for sure, which sometimes doesn't happen for me.  Service was adequately attentive even despite how busy it was.    Pricing is a little on the low side considering it's a city and the portion sizes.    As a note, in order to fill a growler with beer here, the growler must bear the standard Surgeon General's warning.  I suspect that this policy is due to some Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board regulation; it stinks of the PLCB.  Fills cost $25-30, which is on the high side.",

I haven't seen so many fried mushrooms in my life.  They were also amongst the best I have had.  The pastrami sandwich was on point.  I had this for lunch.  I barely ate dinner that night.  Highly recommended.",

We had the first bad experience of 10 years a couple weeks ago attributed to snotty service (he had mike ness hair and was  very chubby on a Friday night), inconsistent food and a lackadaisical manger but today It was all righted. Food was back to its normal awesomeness and our Server, Todd, was way above par! Great experience on a lazy afternoon!",

    "text": "Fathead's is like the Cheesecake Factory of delicious pub food.  I mean that in a good way: an unassuming place with a deceptively large menu and tons of choices.  They also have 42 beers on tap, but we were taking it easy for lunch.  Any place that incorporated pierogies into their sandwiches gets full marks for creativity.  My friend Lili got the Kelsey burger with sharp cheddar, bacon, a potato-filled pierogi and onions with a side of horseradish.  The cheddar had a nice bite, the burger was cooked perfectly, the buns are fresh-baked and delivered by a local bakery daily.  I opted for the Killer Chicken.  A chicken sandwich with swiss cheese, roasted sweet red pepper and a spicy, peppery caribbean sauce, served with ranch on the side.  It was spicy at first, but lost its heat as the meal went on.  Shining start of the meal: the Chicken Parm soup.  It was a tomato-puree based soup with generous amounts of grilled chicken, diced onion, pepper and spices and a good amount of mozzarella cheese on top, baked on like they do a french onion soup.  it was amazingly flavorful and hearty and easily the scene-stealer of the day.  Great food, good price.  I have something to write about  to the boys back home!!",

Roasted Potatoes in a salad, I don't hate it!   I got the grilled shrimp salad that was served in a the family-sized bowl which was delish! I also got a bloody mary which was one of the better ones I have had( all the works celery, olives, lemons, limes).  Bro got a grilled chicken salad which was a perfect 'man's salad' covered in cheese, french fries, and roasted potatoes.  Man Healthy accompanied with a bud lite...classy bro. He dug it tho.   Scene: Mixed crowd (kids, yinzers, yuppies) decent array of males (typical button down crowd), nice outdoor seating area with a lot of fans to beat the Pittsburgh humidity.   Overall: Will check out the bar again with some girlfriends (bro was a bit of a cock block, sry bro)! Check it out!",

Be prepared to wait exceeding long times Fridays and Saturdays as basically all 40+ suburbanites in Pittsburgh converge on the place.",

    "text": "Loved Fat Heads. The wings here are really good. Not as good as the kitchen sink at William Penn but still very good. I like the spicy parmesan and the honey bbq. For the munchies, you need to get the loaded potato skins. They are awesome. My friend used to work there as a host so he'd always bring home a ton of potato skins when he got off work and not gonna lie. Even though they were cold, you throw those in the microwave and heat them up, they are still unbelievable. The pastrami ruben is very good. But my main course is usually a burger. And my ... do they have burgers. I'm a big blue cheese fan so of course I like the bacon blues burger. The mushroom swiss is also very good. I once tried the fiery voodoo killer burger but that was way too hot for me and had to get a different burger instead.   But the best part about fatheads is the BEER!! they have way too many beers here which is awesome. The beer list also changes so you may miss one if you don't swing in frequently. They also have a beer frequent flyer thing that if you drink enough beers consistently at Fat Heads, you get your name put on their wall. One of my friends came here almost nightly to try and get his name on the wall for about 8 months and still couldn't get on it. It's very exclusive and it is awesome if you do get your name up there.",

Initially I wasn't impressed with their drink selection. I wanted a sam Adams imperial stoudt which they did not carry. However I was impressed at with our waitress's knowledge of the menu. She suggested a different imperial stoudt, and I really like it. My alternate beer was defiantly comparable in texture dark, thick, syrupy but slightly sweet. I had a double d sans provolone and Parmesan. It came stacked with sausage , steak, and salami topped off with tomato based sauce.  Pricing is reasonable for the area.",

McMinn's Chicken Dance is mouth-watering (chicken breast, fried egg, cheddar cheese, etc. Need I say more?). Wing Night is the place to be.

Everyone but me tried their beer selection and reported good things. I'm generally a lemon water gal so the beer selection did not affect me. This joint reminded me a lot of the Old Fashioned from Madison but without the fried cheese curds ;).   There was a 45-min wait on a Saturday evening but the atmosphere was cool since we were waiting with friends. If I were actually starving and just wanted a meal, I would avoid this place like the plague because I'm allergic to crowds and people in general.

Everyone seemed to enjoy the beers which was good as they have a great lineup.   We got a bunch of appetizers, fried mushrooms, fried pickles, onion rings, and a soft pretzel (notice the fried theme here!?) the batter had a little spice to it, which was really delicious, and all of the accompanying sauces like honey mustard and a spicy sauce were awesome. Overall the apps did not disappoint.   Then we got to our table. Everyone ordered a variety of different things. Sister had the voodoo burger which she said was delicious. I ordered the brisket at the recommendation of our server. It was OK. Honestly the brisket lacked much flavor so I was a little disappointed in that. The sandwich came with French onion soup for dipping, and was smothered on onions and an aioli. It just didn't do it for me something was off about the taste and it may have been the aioli or the lack of taste of the brisket. My other sister got the pulled pork and said it also did not have a lot of flavor to it. A few others that were with us loved theirs, others not so much, so overall it was hit or miss. Still a south side staple so I'll be back, would likely just try something else!",

I came here to meet a couple of my former nursing school now nursing friends who I haven't seen in much too long because of our different schedules at work. I came a bit early for dinner but I saw one of my friends already waiting outside. He apparently had an smartphone app that showed him how many people were ahead of our group, which I found pretty cool. In a few minutes, we were seated and more of our friends started arriving. The interior is fairly spacious, but was packed because of dinner and the hockey game on TV. Speaking of TVs, you will have little chance missing anything happening because they were placed all over the place!  Our hostess seated us in the small outdoor area that had two circular tables with umbrellas. It was a nice cool day outside, so we were pretty happy. Apparently we just missed happy hour, so we had to order drinks full price. No problem. I took a look at the drink menu, and wow, I couldn't decide. After several minutes, I finally ordered Fat Head's Trail Head pale ale. It tasted hoppy with citrus overtones, a refreshing choice for the night.  I then look at our menus. Considering it was the first time for a few of us, one of my friends persistently recommended the Chik'n Little headwich (\"chicken Fingers dunked in our Original Wing Sauce topped with provolone, 2 fried eggs, American cheese, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion and hot pepper mayo\"). I thought to myself, \"Wow, as a nurse, I'd be crazy to order that!\" Nevertheless, two of my nursing friends ordered it... -_- .  Well, considering I am vegetarian, I chose the Portly Fellow headwich (\"Portobello, roasted red peppers, and fresh spinach topped with tomato sauce, basil pesto, Arrogant Onion Rings and mozzarella, goat cheese and Parmesan\"). My other friends ordered garlic fries, which was amazing! When my headwich came out, I almost fell out of my seat because of how huge it was. Mushrooms, cheese, onions rings, and sauce were oozing out between a large burger bun with a huge steak knife impaling it right down the middle.  I thought to myself, \"I shouldn't have gobbled down this fries...\"  Several minutes later...  \"That was delicious! Wow, did I just each all of it?\"  Yes, it was that good.  After we paid our checks, we even decided to have some ice cream from a place right down the street. Well, why not?  Overall, food was excellent, drinks were excellent, and customer service was great. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Southside.",

Why didn't I think of that?   They have a great craft beer selection including several house brews. The Sunshine Daydream was a good beer if you're a fruit beer person like me. They also have a full bar and cool bartenders ready to mix up whatever you want including totally off the wall never before seen concoctions. Just tell them what you like.  In case you were wondering the pierogis were amazing. Can't wait to get back here and try more menu options and house craft beers from here.",

We split an order of the smoked wings and an order of the fried wings. The smoked wings were solid. Not the best I've ever had, but still really good. The fried wings were solid as well. The Killer sauce punched a mean habanero kick. If you inhale through your mouth while eating them (like I did), it can end up in an embarrassing coughing fit. Not unbearably hot, but not weak either.   We also split an order of the ribs with the Beasty BBQ sauce. Loved the sauce. The ribs weren't exactly fall-off-the-bone, but they were good.   Service was great.   I'm sure they don't want people lingering here, but their choices of television programming left a lot to be desired. They came up on a search of bars in Pitt with MLB Extra Innings...but I don't believe this is actually the case. In the heat of the MLB Wild Card race they were showing the pregame for the hockey World Cup and some Tough Mudder style reality show. I get it. You're Pittsburgh. The Pirates suck and the Penguins have Sidney Crosby. Hockey trumps. BUT...it was like an hour before the game was even starting and there was no sound on. That's my main gripe about this place. If you're going to have TVs in there, have someone in charge of making sure that worthwhile television is being displayed.",

We headed there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and were surprised that they were already quite busy.  We were seated promptly in the outside dining area with no fuss made when we requested to sit at a table that did not line the wall (we have never been a fan of the long benches that line the wall with tables spaced several feet apart, no privacy).  Anyway, it took us several minutes to look over the menu as there are ALOT of options! We agreed upon the pepperoni rolls for an appetizer, I had an order of mild wings, my husband the Chicken Little and my daughter, a cheeseburger (there is no children's menu). The pepperoni rolls were fantastic and I could've eaten more! Great crunchy crust with flavorful cheese, pepperoni and sauce on the side! Yummy!  The sandwiches were huge! The Chicken Little was served with homemade chips while the cheeseburger was served with fries (note: they do not allow substitutions on potatoes) both were very tasty.  My husband reports that the sandwich was very good and my daughter had to bring much of her lunch home, it was just too much! The wings were average size and were good but a little dry for my taste.  We will be visiting again, just so we can try something else from the extensive menu!",

We were seated promptly and ordered the following items:  Pepsi Tea Five killer wings (5/5 fat heads in heat) Ten original wings (4/5 fat heads heat) Chicken soup Smokey burger with fries Side of Homemade chips  I was really jonesing to try the Killer wings...I really enjoy food that is piquant with good flavor.  The waitress just looked at me and asked if I was certain and I said yes.  After waiting for a few minutes we recieved the wings and the chicken soup.  The chicken soup was really nothing special.  It was obvious that it was made from fresh ingredients, but the flavors were not in balance -- certain herbs were masking the flavor of the chicken partially while completely smothering the taste of the vegetables.  I put my nose close to the wings and took a good whiff.  I was suprised to find that my nose did not retaliate.  I knew right off the bat that they were not as hot as billed.  I dug into the killer wings and ate two of them before I switched to the original wings.  I was not impressed.  The heat is NOT commensurate with the flavor in either the killer nor the original.  In fact, the flavor of the killer wings was subpar compared to the original wings.  Do not get these wings unless you hang out with a bunch of people that have no affinity for piquant foods and you are trying to show off.  The flavor is just not worth it.  The original wings, while not as bad as the killer, had a bit of a sweet base to them rather than the acidic base that I am so fond of...if you like sweeter things, you may like these.  I will be going for one of the 3/5 fat heads in piquancy next time to see if there is a better equilibrium between heat and flavor.  As I was finishing the last of the wings, our sandwich arrived.  The flavor was somewhat lackluster; there was just too much bread.  As I was eating the hamburger, I started to speak to our server and she asked how the sandwich was.  She stated that for some reason the company they purchase bread from gave them rolls that were larger than normal and she was wondering what we thought.  Being myself, I told her about the overabundance of bread.  While the food itself wasn't that great, I must say that the service was exemplary.  At no point did I feel smothered nor did I feel neglected.  Our servers chipper and up-front attitude definitely earned points in my book.  I will return, if nothing else to have a beer or two; but I do want to retry the burger to see how it is with the proper ratio of bread to burger.",

First off I asked the waitress if it would be possible to have a glass of Sangria.  Her response was a curt we don't have that.  With that being said its not hard to throw together a sangria but..ok.  I then ask for white wine.  My wine arrives in a lipstick stained glass...yummy.  After my husband drinks his beer we notice his glass was also dirty.  The table was also dirty and the chicken in my salad was terribly dry!!!!  My husband liked his wings.  The service was really bad also.  I will never eat there again.",

Excellent service.   He ended up buying a Fat Heads t-shirt, so I KNOW he was impressed. As a chef, it's not always easy to find a meal he enjoys 100%.    Well played, Fat Heads (certainly better than our beloved Sox that night!)",

We were only there for a few beers anyway, and beers they surely gots: Dozens and dozens of craft beers- good ones, a great draft beer selection, plus Fat Heads' own brews which were mighty good too. A vast array there for you. Our bartender was friendly, our order of ten of their hottest, spiciest char-grilled wings were good. Yeah, they come in 5's and 10's. Shrug, I dunno. We were not starvin, just a mite peckish, so the plate of wings hit the spot. I understand that this place is known for their headwiches, so I'll be keeping that in mind, during future Pitts times...

I saw the table next to ours and noticed what I thought was a lot left on the table. So I worried but there was no reason to - it was because they give you large portions.  I had the arugula salad with a hamburger petty, one daughter had the divine swine and the other a burger.  All foods were cooked to our specifications. Our waiter was really good - as good as he could be and was very pleasant, although he was really really busy.  Another table near ours ordered the nachos - made with the housemade chips; they looked really good and a meal in itself.  My girls only ate half their sandwiches as they were very good sized - but also I thought the food was very good, and very reasonable. I felt like the people who worked their appreciated our business.  We went for a bit of a walk afterwards and on the way back ran into some travelers on foot from California; we ended up giving them our leftovers. I hope they enjoyed them as much as we did.

I wouldn't mind paying a buck or 2 up charge, but the little note the menu explains that this can't be done. The wings were only ok. The beer is good, but very overpriced for often small pours. It's a shame when I can get a bigger, cheaper Fat Head's draft at pretty much any bar other than Fat Head's itself. For reasons I can't explain, it's always packed. Always. Be prepared to wait, and never even get a seat at the bar. Service has ranged from fine to god awful and slow.

After years of complaining of how disgusting their food was, I am pleasantly surprised to find that I thoroughly enjoyed my last meal. I have a blueberry chicken salad that was Really good. I felt great eating it. Felt great afterwards.  Delicious. I highly suggest it. And I can't wait to try some of the new menu items. Finally some items so the entire family can find something comfortable to eat! I did modify but the greens were abundant & fresh. Crisp. Grilled chicken was moist and flavorful. The blueberries were plump & fresh. And the dressing. The blueberry ale dressing is the star of the show. FatHeads has a real winner with this menu addition!",

Definitely take the previous reviews seriously when they say the portions are huge! I got the Divine Swine. If you are a wimp when it comes to spicy food, be warned. The Smoky BBQ sauce set my mouth on fire, bad enough that I had to force myself to finish half of my sandwich.  I also wasn't impressed by the chips, they were pretty flavorless. They have a great beer selection.  I tried the Jack Straw and the Trail Head, and both were very good. Overall I liked Fat Head's, but I don't know if it's a Pittsburgh must visit place, like Primanti Brothers is.",

They are mediocre. That really isn't a problem though since the sandwiches always fill me up.  Their beer selection is my problem. It is a huge, but the prices are high and they don't use full pint glasses. They need to drop the prices or use real pint glasses.  My other issue is the service. It is always slow. I don't know how they can solve the issue though. I don't think they can fit any more bar staff in.  I'd strongly recommend Fat Head's off hours. I'd advise against it on Friday and Saturday nights.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love a brewery with a restaurant in it, right? We stopped here as a \"must do\" while in Pittsburgh. Bottom line, it was okay. Alcohol selections are the bomb - As far as the food I think it's more hype than substance. Review gets 3 stars - one for concept, two for beer selection, three for some bright spots in the food experience.  ATMOSPHERE: Very \"Fat Heads\" centric, obviously. There are tons and tons of Fat Head beer marketing campaigns, past and present - very fun to look at. That said, the noise level is WAY over the top, the high ceilings only amplifying an already too noisy dining area. Don't go here if you are looking to talk with your date / friend / partners in crime... we could not hear each other at all, and resorted to mostly hand signals.  FOOD: MEH... I was totally ready for blow-your-mind goodness based on other reviews. Maybe it was an off night for the cook, or maybe alcohol dulls tasting capabilities (sorry fellow yelpers), but for our money, what we got was dry, boring, and relatively tasteless. Our entrees, such as they were:  1) Wayne Sandwich  - the kielbasa sausage was truly a nice variation from traditional sandwiches, and the sausage itself was nicely flavored. Outside that, it lacked any other flavor (where's the sauce, folks???), and was something I felt I could have put together at home. PRO - it's a huge sandwich.... so huge that our server recommended we split it (thank you for that!)  2) Fat Heads Fingers - Had to order this app for the kids (NO KIDS MENU PEOPLE - BEWARE if you have children). These were okay, but not anything special - the breading was virtually unseasoned, the ends of the fingers so well done they were almost inedible. I found myself thinking that they SHOULD be a kids menu item, because adults should know better than to pay for this level of blandness. PRO - the sauce which came with the fingers rocked... if the cook put that level of passion into the fingers themselves, it would have been 5 stars instead of 1.  SERVICE: Below Average. Our server had some ideas she was willing to share while we ordered, but then we had a hard time getting her attention after that. Someone else brought our food to us, and we'd have had at least another drink more each but she never returned to take the order (or to ask how our meal was).   VALUE: Meh. The prices are okay, but I expected far better quality for my money based on other reviews.  In short, go as a novelty, or if you're looking to drink good beer in a bar that happens to serve food.  If you are looking to go purely on the food alone, you'll likely end up disappointed.",

It wasn't until I moved southeast that I realized the rest of the world does not grease every pile of lettuce with fried potatoes.  In case you are an out-of-towner like me, or you live under a rock, Fat Heads brews their own beer.  I tried the IPA, it's okay.  Wasn't bursting with hoppiness, but it did the job.  Contrary to what most every review of Fat Heads discusses (wings, burgers, the causes of your impending heart disease), I will rave about the salads.  If you've read maybe half of any one of my reviews you know I love my big salads.  Well, Fat Heads' salads are HUGE.   Everyone (except me) took half of theirs home. Each one comes in a punch bowl, and topped with fries a la western PA.   The fries were meh.  I was disappointed, but not enough to knock a star.  Dense and solid more than crispy and mushy.  That just means I ate fewer fries. A win in my book.  Ambiance is great alfresco.  Refreshing and peaceful, still hosting the cheery indoor Fat Heads' mood.  This is definitely one of my new faves in the burgh.",

I (luckily) grabbed an unoccupied stool at the bar, not knowing the entire place would be completely packed later in the evening. I'm glad I arrived before 7 pm and never moved.  Beer: over 40 great draft selections, all listed above the bar with corresponding ABV. There were four original Fat Heads brews and I decided to try the Goggle Fogger, a refreshing Hefe-Weizen. It was so good, I felt obligated to have a second 20 oz sampling during dinner.  Food: Unbeknownst to me, Monday night is Wing Night starting at 7 pm. Sounded good, especially at 40 cents apiece and unlimited mix-and-match choices. I ordered three triplets of: Cajun Ranch (dry), Spicy Parmesan and Jalapeno Cheddar. All three were good, crispy and flavorful, but I favored SP the best.  After enjoying the food, drink and the beginning of the MLB Home Run Derby, I decided to head out. Apparently my intent did not go unnoticed as a guy sidled up to me when I was paying my bill, eyeing up my barstool with great interest. No wonder...this place is awesome!",

They all have fun names, which adds some nice personality.  They have a small outdoor seating area, which is nice in the summer.  If you do plan on going here - get there early.

We have eaten here a few times before, just never this late.  They were serving food until midnight so we snuck our orders in quickly and had some great brews to enjoy while waiting.  We ordered 10 wings with the fat head's original sauce; they came with celery, carrots, and your choice of ranch or blue cheese.  We also ordered some fresh cut fries.  Everything was really good.  There was only one server/bartender so things at times moved slowly but all was good.  The last time we came here they had this pierogie and sausage dish on the menu.

From time to time the service can be sub-par.  And most nights and definitely on weekends?  Forget it, there's going to be a wait.  So anymore I go for lunch at off-times or get take out when I'm really craving those sandwiches.  Again, if the food wasn't such a draw, there would be fewer stars in my review.  But they've got some of the best wings.  Great appetizers.  And I'm a sucker for homemade chips.  (Hint: go for Pedro's Nachos if you like homemade chips.)  The sandwiches and burgers will definitely not leave you hungry and they have some rather creative combinations.  They even have big salads, though I can't say I've ever tried one.    Is it worth the wait?  Yeah, it is.  And if you can get a bartender's attention you can kill a few drafts while you wait.  But for me, I'm too old to wait.",

We had really good service and just walked in and got a table immediately (5:00 on a Monday ) . Ordered the Bumbleberry beer and Frickles (which could serve 4 people easily) as an app. Also had the Pittsburgh salad and wondered when the waiter asked if we were sharing it?! And then it came and was HUGE!! We were offered a sample of the Holly JOLLY beer and it was good too. This place is a must go!!",

Our waitress Tori was excellent. She was a beer rep for the company, so she was very knowledgeable about the company's expansion and drink selection. She took the time to sit down and explain menu items. You could tell that she was passionate about the company.   We had the pretzel appetizer, which was cooked perfectly. I recommend getting it with light salt. The beer cheese was okay, along with the mustard, but the pretzel is so good that it doesn't really need anything extra.  I ordered the smoked wings with a side of smoky bbq, the big beefy barbecue handwich, and a side of fries. The portion sizes are huge, as everyone else has mentioned. The wings were okay. The rub was nice but the meal in general seemed to be missing some flavor. The wings were good once you used the ranch and smoky bbq side to doctor them up a bit. The fries were okay, but again, needed a little flavor. The \"handwich\" was great, but a better bun would've taken it over the top.  Overall, what really impressed me was out waitress. She really made my night in terms of a great dining experience. I was looking for a little more flavor, but I would frequent again for the customer service alone.",

The woman told us it would be about a 20-25 minute wait. We decided to walk around while waiting. However, after about 4-5 minutes we got a message saying our table was ready. When we got back, they said they in fact didn't have a table for us because they didn't realize we needed a highchair (we specified this prior). Therefore, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. It was actually sort of frustrating. When we finally got sat it took our server quite a few minutes before coming over and then a few more minutes to get our drinks. The food was actually really good. The beer was excellent and cold.",

Ordered the chicken little sandwich and was amazing....friend ordered the famous \"slopes headwich\" and was awful along with the \"wanzco chicken\" sandwich.

For sandwiches you can not substitute fries for the chips (big disappointment) not a huge chips fan, but love fries.  Tip: Headwiches are bigger than the sandwiches but not by much if trying to decide between the two.  Overall: Good service, Good environment, Hit or miss on food sandwiches.",

I'm giving this a four star review because my Pittsburgh salad came out with no french fries and that's a pretty big faux pas. To be fair they did bring me out a side of super fresh really delicious french fries that I've been ate with ranch dressing, so not all was lost. The wings here are super good, as is the brisket salad-they smoke their meeting house and they certainly do a good job. The sandwiches are just incredibly huge, totally splittable, actually everything on the menu is totally splittable unless you're in the mood for a serious eating experience quantity wise.  Are usually go for lunch just because going to the southside any evening during the week is a circus. Especially Thursday Friday Saturday even Sunday, it's undergrad central and everybody's out on the prowl an extra hammered.",

There may have been other options but I was in a hurry so took what was first available.  As it turns out, I was the first one there so I sat at the bar and had a beer. Loving craft beer, this was a great place for me with plenty of options. I've been to the main brewery in Cleveland before so I knew what I was getting into.  Many taps were available.  Once everyone arrived, we were sat in in the back by the hostess and our drink ordered were taken quickly.  Since I had never eaten here before, the Headwiches were suggested. I settles on The Pull Monty. Pulled chicken with Carolina sauce, slaw and jalapenos.  It did not disappoint and was huge!  Not just a clever name. This thing is as big as your head!  I'm a sucker for Carolina sauce and while this wasn't the best I've ever had, it went well on the Headwich.  The fries were just average fries but they give you a lot!  It was a nice atmosphere for a lunch but I'd like to come back in the evening to see how things are and try more beers. The service was excellent and we had no complaints.  Give them a try next time you are in Southside!",

They didn't have chicken and didn't tell us that when we ordered. They did call us back after a half hour to let us know and had us reorder and told us it would be ready in 25 minutes. We arrive after a half hour and they have no idea where our order is. After another 30 minutes of waiting they tell us the kitchen said they made it but the host staff said they didn't so they made it again and then we waited another 30 minutes for them to remake it. Not once did anyone apologize or even offer to adjust our bill. When we finally got our food one of our meals had been sitting at the host stand since the time we walked in door meaning it's not even safe to go serve. They could have offered us a beer but no. Not even that. Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I will never go back nor will I buy any of their beer.",

You can never go wrong with their giant sandwiches, and it's the only place where I'll get something different each time I go. I've yet to be disappointed.  Only complaint- parking.  Best to uber or take Lyft especially on a weekend night.",

    "text": "Ate here a few weeks back and I found the sandwiches to be really good... and really GINORMOUS.  I didn't even get a sandwich they joked about being as big as your head... still TOO much.  Beers are the primary reason to come here though.  They have such a tasty variety of beer you can't go wrong.  The sandwiches were decent but I still enjoyed it because it was a novelty and something I don't get everyday in taste and size.  The wings we ordered... those were huge too... or wait, did we get the regular chicken legs?  Either way those were better than the sandwiches in my opinion.     I'd definitely go back but definitely not in the winter.  It was FRIGGIN COLD in that place.  Every time the door opened from a customer coming and going the place dropped in temperature another 5 degrees!!  I'd go in the summer or fall though so maybe next time we're in town for a Steelers' game.  For a Penguins' game we'll have to try someplace better insulated!",

    "text": "I have no complaints about Fat Heads. Honestly, I can't think of one negative from my dinner there last night. There was a bit of a wait for a table so my husband and I got a drink at the bar. Huge beer menu, including many house brews! If you like ales, this is the place for you.. They told us 30 min for our wait, but it was only 15. Perfect.  The service was very prompt. We had drinks within 5 minutes, ordered our appetizers, and those were out within 10 min. We were never without a beverage and the waitress checked on us just enough times.    Most of their menu, including sauces, dressings, chili and soups is home made. You can tell by the flavors. The pulled pork chili was so good that I almost ordered another bowl. I wanted to stick my face into the bowl and get every last drop. My husband had the spinach and artichoke dip and felt the same way. Appetizer plates were licked clean!  We both opted for wings. He got the classic fried in Extra medium (like a wet cajun) and garlic parmesan. They were HUGE. He had no problem putting away 14 of them, though. I got the slow smoked, chargrilled whole wings because they are gluten free (and soy free!). Holy moly. They fell off the bone but still had super crispy skin. I got the Carolina sauce which is an amazing tangy (well, Carolina style) BBQ sauce with hints of honey mustard, vinegar and cumin. I asked for more sauce because they lightly brush them. I wanted my wings doused in this stuff because it was so good.   Overall, I cannot wait to come back! Their gluten free menu is gigantic and also includes GF buns, baguettes, and a wide selection of their menu, including apps, can be made gluten free. Just ask for a menu at the front!",

The beer selection is awesome, and the servers know their beers.  The sandwiches impress people because they're big, so big they're dubbed 'headwiches.'  I had a meatloaf headwich; it was very pickly, a strange flavor for meatloaf.  The headwiches come with hard, brittle, burnt house-made potato chips.  You can't substitute fries (it must throw their kitchen off or something).  The salads are just as big, but they have their own problems, like big, starchy, fried wedges of potatoes ostensibly called fries.  They're not fries.  They're not crispy, not soggy, and not creamy.  They come off like boiled potatoes and just don't work in the salad.  The best accompaniment to the beers are the wings, but be sure to stick with the fried wings and not that awful variation called the 'smoked wing.'  Pick your size, pick your sauce.  These are some of the biggest wings in Pittsburgh.",

Big menu of casual food - the burgers in particular are very tasty. Fresh-cut fries are served in a massive portion. One downside is that there can sometimes be a big wait, but since they're on the No Wait app you can get in line before arriving which helps a lot.  Recently found out that they have a dedicated gluten free menu and are very careful about cross-contamination. That is awesome for people out there who have Celiac and/or other food allergies.",

    "text": "This place is a southside staple! Forget Primantis brothers for a minute and focus on this sandwich loving, craft beer promoting establishment.   My current check ins don't accurately reflect how many times I've been here and introduced people to this fine restaurant. Let's begin why this a rare 5-star hotspot on my opinon:  The Food: Fat Heads boasts a large menu that is centered around what I like to call Up-Scale bar items such as: Wings, Sandwiches (I mean Headwiches), Salads, assortment of fried things, Nachos (#Love), and of course in house craft beer as well as a wide selection of other noteworthy craft brews. Side Note: They also have a few Cider selections from the best Cider producer in the area: Arsenal!!!   Beer: I just mentioned this in the above, however it deserves another mention. Fat Heads has  their own line of craft beer that any beer drinker can enjoy. In addition, they have a seasonal rotating wide selection of other breweries for one to choose from. Also as mentioned above, they have some Arsenal cider always on tap. Usually 2 - 3 types. Lastly, Liquor, I honestly don't know if they have liquor as the thought never crossed my mind to ask or request one and I don't feel like checking the online menu.   Atmosphere: The venue is open with ground floor seating that usually encompanies the view of a nearby flat screen TV. This place usually has ESPN or live sports on which is fine by me. Side Note: This place has outdoor like seating that is further covered and heated when the temp drops below 50.   TL;DR: Fat Heads is a Pittsburgh staple less known than another sandwich shop across town. This place has prime sandwiches, wings, salads, and everything in between. Sports bar for sure that has a wide rotating craft beer selection on tap and in bottle. Have an allergy, they offer Gluten Free rolls for all their sandwiches and believe, check me on this, a separate fryer as well.",

    "text": "Are you in the mood for a super-filling, American meal--or just some great munchies--and an excellent draft list?  Then head on over to Fat Heads, because they've got you covered--from head to toe!  I came here with a friend for dinner on Thurs. evening at around 7pm, and we were seated immediately, despite that the Steelers were playing at 8pm.  Having perused the reviews and the extensive menu ahead of time, I knew what I wanted, and was able to make recommendations for my friend.  We started out with some Arsenal cider drafts (red raspberry for me, amber for him), which were great (I feel confident saying this for him, too, since he drank his in about 5 min. flat).  Per my recommendation, we ordered a pretzel with honey mustard sauce, and when it came out, we devoured it in 5 min. flat, as well.  (The pretzels and sauce here are much better and less salty than those at Hofbrauhaus, so be sure to try one!)  For entrees, I went with the grown-up grilled cheese on rye and the chicken parmesan soup, and my friend ordered the Beauty and the Beastie headwich, which is filled with pulled pork and hot sauce.  The grilled cheese, which consists of herbed goat cheese, fontina, chopped basil, and sun-dried tomatoes, was excellent, and I'd highly recommend it as a headwich alternative.  The homemade potato chips that came with it are the best I've had to date--much better than the ones at Burgatory.  On the other hand, despite its interesting concept and description, I found the chicken parm soup lackluster in flavor. I had pictured a cream or broth-based soup, but it was actually tomato based, and its saltiness and tomato flavor overwhelmed the chicken, which there wasn't as much of as I expected.  I ended up using the potato chips to scoop up and eat most of the soup, which (believe it or not) helped cut its salty, bland flavor.  My friend devoured his headwich, leaving very little of the pulled pork, so again, I feel confident in saying he enjoyed it.  While I managed to clean my plates (impressing the waiter), he ended up taking home most of his chips.  Service was prompt and friendly, and the ambience was casual and relaxed at the time we visited.  We sat inside because it was cool and I hadn't brought a jacket, but still managed to find some interesting people watching at the table diagonal from us (one chick with faux dreds was doing some interesting jamming to the music).  Since we arrived prior to the Steelers game, the Pens game was on TV for most of the time we were there, but at one point, one of the waitstaff inexplicably changed the channel on one TV to Home Shopping Network (per customer request, I'm assuming--but who watches HSN at Fat Heads?).  Many times, in judging the quality of food that a restaurant serves, I feel that my rating hinges on what I order.  In general, I tend to stick to dishes a place is known for or that other reviewers recommend, in order to ensure that my experience is representative.  Occasionally, however, I will deviate if a restaurant has a very good reputation, which sometimes turns out well and other times, not so much. Based on the food and my experience, my rating for Fatheads would have merited 5 stars if I'd stuck to the recommended pretzel and grilled cheese. Nevertheless, in keeping with procedure, I feel that I must deduct half a star for the bland and salty chicken parm soup.  4.5 stars.",

Do they now produce their beer in the Cleveland area?... yes. Do rivers of IC Light flow from the taps on a daily basis?...  absolutely not.  What does flow from Fat Heads taps is a glorious display of self-brewed staples and other craft treats...  all of which are needed to wash down the absolutely monstrous portion sizes this place has.  Dieters take warning... even the salads are gargantuan.  Often wise size comes sacrificed quality, but this isn't the case.  I've yet to have something at Fat Heads I've disliked except for the incessant wait times.  A tip to those who haven't been there before.  When you put your name in at the hostess (they don't take reservations), they'll ask for your phone number to enter it into their system.  If there aren't seats available at Fat Heads bar, take advantage of the often 45 min - 1 hr wait to walk across the street to Piper's Pub (or any of the other 10+ bars in close vicinity) to grab a drink while you wait.",

Gigantic sandwiches/burgers and beers went directly into our bellies.  I failed to take notice of what everyone else ordered (I believe our friend got a Portobello mushroom burger of some build, and my wife got some sort of fried-egg Agro-crag), but I know I had a burger with a beef patty, pastrami and an egg, among other toppings.  I could not even get to eating the chips that came with that monster.  A nice beer selection, as well.  I do come short of doling out a 5-star review as I felt like the table was a little sticky, the chairs were a little beat up and uncomfortable, but I think that's part of the schtick of the place.  Would definitely recommend trying, but you may need 24-48 hours of nap-time before eating/drinking anything else.",

    "text": "If you've ever wanted to die by food-induced coronary, I've found you Fat Heads.  Over the course of our al fresco evening here, ten of us sampled the following fat-saturated delights:  ~ Cornmeal crusted, deep fried Buffalo-Style Shrimp. ~ Deep-fried cheese 'n' potato Pierogies with a side of sour cream. ~ A giant plate of Garlic Fries dusted with Parmesan and parsley. ~ The Artery Clogger Headwich: two fried eggs, bacon, ham, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo between one big-ass bun. ~ Two of \"Maxim\" magazine's #5 sandwich in all the land, The Southside Slopes Headwich.  This bad boy has a split kielbasa, fried pierogies, American cheese, grilled onions and horseradish sauce on one of those head-sized buns. ~ A Tuna Steak Sandwich with char-grilled yellowfin, lettuce, tomato, onion and garlic-Parm mayo. ~ The Best BLT served on rye and topped with -- what else? -- American cheese and mayo. ~ Cajun Tuna Taco Press, Cajun-spiced yellowfin, black olives, cilantro tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, red onion and taco sour cream sauce panini-pressed in a flour tortilla.  All burgers, the Fried Fish Sammie, and the Tuna Steak Sammie come with hand-cut fries; everything else comes with hand-cut homemade potato chips.  The menu literally dictates absolutely no substitutions since it's a \"complete hassle\" for the kitchen to switch.  Really?  It's all deep-fried potato.  So how were the heart-attacks on a plate?  Stick with what Fat Head's known for, those Headwiches and burgers, because they were the runaway stand-outs (and you could literally feel your arteries hardening with each sloppy, greasy bite), enjoyed tremendously by those what ordered them.  Everything else was just OK; my Cajun Tuna Taco Press, and FIL's Tuna Steak Sandwich -- both requested rare -- came out regrettably cooked within an inch of their beautiful lives.  For me, the greater pleasure here were the beers.  Fat Head's menu of standard draughts is rather uninspired and unadventurous -- Yuengling, Bell's Oberon, Guinness, Sierra Nevada, Newcastle, Smithwick's -- but their own creations are where it's at.  We sampled their Alpenglow Weizenbock, a banana-y, bubble-gum-y dark unfiltered wheat brew with toasted malt overtones.  I loved their Mexicali Smoke, too, a chipotle-spiced rauchbier.  Husband was exceptionally disappointed that they'd run out of their award-winning Head Hunter IPA, however, since he's in love with that bitter style.  Carson Street reminded me of Adams-Morgan-meets-Georgetown in the worst possible way on our post-eleven-pm-Saturday-night visit with gaggles of bachelorette parties shrieking at the tops of their lungs and hosts of popped-collar fratties clogging the streets.  Fat Heads, too, was wall-to-wall with drunken, raucous and phenomenally loud groups of young'uns.  I'm too old for all those shenanigans anymore; if I return to Fat Heads, it'll be for the Portly Fellow Headwich I *should* have ordered, and it'll be at the early-bird hour.",

But lately it seems that Fat Heads has gone downhill!  1) The beer doesn't rotate as much as it used to.  2) Fat Heads doesn't seem as busy as it used to be. This seems like a result of many bars on Carson carrying similar beer for less $. Sure, it gets crowded before games, but not much activity after 10 pm.  The food is still good - love the Spicy Parm sandwich and the chips. This place just changed a bit since I was in school here.",

We sat and ordered an appetizer. We got \"Pedro's nachos\" and my god they were a huge portion and used fresh made potato chips over tortilla and they were amazing! I got a Renees chicken club that was rather good. Even though the wait was long our food came out in a timely fashion.

Fat Heads also brings it with their expansive and fair priced beer list.  Their house brews are top notch and should not be forgotten.  Before I briefly talk about the food I feel like I should mention that the reason Fat Heads is losing a star is not because of the food or drinks, but because the service often leaves something to be desired.  When Fat Heads is full and you put your name on the wait list be prepared to be misquoted, forgotten in the shuffle, and treated rudely when asking for updates.  Drinks often don't get refilled and you always feel like you are a bother to the majority of the staff.  If the food wasn't so good I'd avoid Fat Heads.  Onto the food!  I'd have to say my 3 favorite dishes at Fat Heads would be the Fiery Voodoo Killer Burger, which is not for the faint of heart.  The Killer sauce is amazing spicy, but is hands down my favorite wing sauce in the city.  Sweet, salty, and spicy. The Southside Slopes, pierogies on a sandwich?!  This sandwich was voted into Maxim's top sandwich list for a reason.  Kielbalsa, pierogies, horseradish, and grilled onions, nothing else needs said.  And finally the char grilled wings with the aforementioned Killer sauce.  Get a cold IPA and dig in.  Fat Heads is worth rolling the dice with poor service.",

Everything is pretty good, and because everything is consistent, it is normally PACKED inside, and the wait times can get a little long. This isn't really anything I can fault Fat Heads for, but it is something that is normally a factor in whether or not I end up going to Fat Heads.

I started out by ordering one of their own brews, Bumbleberry, a honey blueberry ale garnished with what else but fresh, sweet blueberries. It was delicious and a perfect fit for a hot day.   As an appetizer, even though it was hot outside, I had to try the Chicken Parmesan soup. The soup was an awesome tomato and meat base with chunks of chicken, all covered up by a layer of provolone and parmesan and broiled until bubbly and delicious. It was fantastic!  For my entree, I ordered the PCI (Pretty Cool Italian Club) and it was mammoth and did not disappoint! The sandwich starts out with a layer of banana peppers then stacks of salami, ham, cappicola and pepperoni, melted cheese, sliced hard-boiled eggs, lettuce, tomato and onions and held together with a flavorful rosemary mayo! Served along side this beast was a heaping portion of their fresh cut chips which were the perfect complement to the sandwich (or, as they prefer to say, \"headwich\").  The food and beer was great but the staff are an equal part of why I will definitely return. My bartender, Joe, was the best. A great personality from he and the other bar staff made for an extremely pleasant visit! I will definitely return whenever I am in Pittsburgh!",

First of all you get the ENTIRE wing, it's not those little wing dings you get at other places. And I think this is one of the only, if not THE only place in the city that serves grilled wings. I order the wings plain and ask for a couple different flavored sauces on the side to dip in (because my indecisiveness won't allow me to just choose one flavor - I can't be alone on this amirite???) their grilled wings are always great tasting. That being said about the food, the service inside, not that great. One of the reasons I go out places in the first place is to have a relaxing meal and not have to cook. Another experience is a misunderstanding, I've never ordered the normal fried wings. I placed an order for grilled wings over the phone, but when I arrived to pick up my order I see that they prepared fried wings...mind you I ordered for my boyfriend and I so I ordered 30 wings (my boyfriends appetite is insane lol) so when I get there to see that the wrong wings were given to me I was a little frustrated considering we live 30 minutes away and drove all the way there only to see that the order was wrong. What do you think the right thing to do would be? Probably have the employees apologize for getting the order wrong and say they will prepare what I actually ordered? NOPE. This place tried to charge me to have them remake my order!! Horrible customer service I paid already for the wrong order and now they are saying they're not going to make what I ordered unless I pay for them. Horrible experience. I asked to speak to someone else who eventually said they would remake and I would not have to pay, meanwhile I'm thinking \"WELL YA! I should not have to pay for YOUR employees mistake\" at the end of the day, we got our right order that we originally ordered, it was 40 minutes later, but we got them. Probably won't be back though for this reason.",

The wait is long, the food is always overcooked and bland, the bartenders and servers are rude, and the prices are too high for the quality of food. Last time I tried (again) to eat a burger and fries. And the burger was like a burnt hockey puck (again). They try to be something unique, gourmet, and special, but they always miss the mark.",

    "text": "Eh. I used to come here back in the day (like a decade ago) and loved it, because Pittsburgh didn't really have anything like it. The draft selection is fantastic, always has been. The service is very nice, always has been. But I remember the food being a lot better... Maybe my palate has changed? Maybe it's just because it's so successful and commercial now that they don't really have to try? Whatever it is, the food is just ok. The wings are good, but not worth the eternal wait there always is to get seated. The \"smoked\" meats are pretty subpar for what they're going for - that sort of \"craft beer, craft food.\" The bread they use for the sandwiches is a step up from the cheap stuff, but nothing great. The food in general is much better than fast food or crappy restaurants, but for what else is on the Pittsburgh scene nowadays it's nothing special. The chips are made fresh, but they aren't seasoned - it's weird things like that that perplexes me about this menu... There are also no substitutions allowed, because it's always so crowded, and honestly they're so popular they don't have to cater to people anymore. Again, it's a completely fine and acceptable place, good even, but for me it's not really worth the crowds and the wait. Maybe for you it will be; it's worth a shot if you've never been to decide for yourself.",

The serving staff is overall pleasant, minus the occasional 'bad day' face. I try something different on the menu every time I go simply because it all sounds so good!   And, I'm going to get slapped for this I'm  sure, the only minor thing i would suggest be altered slightly would be the tasty homemade potato chips. A majority of the time I've gotten them - they have been under seasoned and overly greasy in taste. I wouldn't mind a bit of salt and slightly less grease.   Other than that, everything has always been perfect!",

We did wait, but the nice thing is that they call you instead of holding a pager - so being in a prime location, we decided to go bar hop and just came back when they called me!  It was great.  The food was amazing.  If you're looking for calorie loaded, grease leaking, mouth watering, heart stopping food then look no further!  We LOVED it.  It was my two girlfriends and myself and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs (mind you we had our beer goggles on).  We decided to get two different burgers and appetizer to share - we could barely finish it all which is so unlike us!  We got the nacho appetizer that I would recommend to ANYONE.  It's made on their house made chips and is honestly to die for.  I can't wait to go back and to check out their other location near my house (NE OH).  I'll have to wait until I get another diet cheat day, it'll cost me my month of them!",
