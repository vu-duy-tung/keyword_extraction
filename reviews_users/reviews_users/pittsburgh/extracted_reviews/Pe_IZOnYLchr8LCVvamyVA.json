The waffles were not especially tasty but they have a variety if combinations. The waffles were definitely fresh and they have great selection of juices and coffee. I recommend this place! Make sure to make reservations or come early. It is not open all day and it can get super busy. My favorite is the southern and the country benedict. In the summer, it will also be nice to sit outside because it is a nice area!",

It wasn't their fault, they seemed set up for failure.  Food was sub-par, not worth the 50min wait (we were told 20min).  Seems like a new restaurant but they need to go back to the drawing board with a direction and management on how to handle brunches on the weekend brunches.  2 stars b/c of the coffee.",

We were able to walk there, but the location is very convenient if you drive and have to park nearby. We ordered the BC Breakfast and Sausage Gravy Waffles- both came out quickly and were absolutely delicious. The portions were large and we both wound up taking leftovers home. Our waitress was awesome, very attentive and helpful with recommendations and didn't hover between checking on us. We will definitely be back again. Try the chicken cranberry sausage as a side, it was perfect with our meals.",

The waffle was $7 and each infusion/topping was $1.50. My boyfriend had one of the May specials, the \"Waffles Frolic\" which broke a waffle into 4 parts, each with different toppings. The sausage gravy and the bacon/cheese/sour cream waffles were the best. The atmosphere is more like a chain restaurant but the food was good. There is no outdoor seating and only street parking.",

There are multiple tables with dirty dishes on them and they keep moving them from table to table. The food is good, but they need to figure out how to properly run a restaurant! Working in the restaurant business for years to have a successful organization you need the following : bus staff to clear tables, food runners, a manager on the floor, more staff. A place to have staff process billing. Drinks should all be in one spot not in random spots. Was the dishwasher even working? Coffee being given in travel cups!. I witnessed a waitress have three dirty tables to take a cigarette break.  The women working in the kitchen is AMAZING!!!",

My husband ordered the country Benedict and it was a lot of food.

Both dishes were about $13 which I thought was a good deal. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",

No biggie to me, I just was short on time and placed an order to go thinking I didn't have to wait as long. WRONG. After 40 mins of standing by the hostess area where I placed my order (breakfast magic I believed I ordered?), I asked her when my food would be ready. \"Oh it's ready now, let me go get it\" *eye roll* Sooooooooo you knew my order was ready to go but left me waiting how long extra since it was made just for me to bring it up to youuu???? So annoying. I had max 5 mins to eat the thing once I was able to sit outside by a bench and once I opened it, it ended up being a lousy regular waffle with a simple egg and some bacon crumpling on top. Cold obviously and the overall taste was just blah. I wasted 40 mins for this? A waffle takes literally 2-3 mins to make on a waffle maker and an egg another 2 mins.. I threw most of it out. I feel nausea now just thinking about the taste.",

We had The Benny (their take on eggs Benedict with ham, egg, crab & hollandaise in a waffle) and the Southern Benedict (fried chicken, sausage gravy & egg). Both were excellent, but the Southern edged out the regular Benedict for our favorite. The sausage gravy was superb, and the chicken was perfectly fried and crispy. Additionally, the coffee was some of the best I've had.  We were greeted warmly, seated promptly, and our server was polite and attentive. The food arrived hot and quickly.   All in all, this is a great place for an affordable, casual breakfast when you're downtown and not in the mood to spend $80-100 on brunch, but you still want a delicious meal at a place where the spoons aren't greasy. We'll be going back again soon!",

Our server, Jack, greeted us just as promptly for our drink order. His attention to us continued at perfect intervals during our meal. Forward the end of our meal my husband ordered decaf coffee. Jack took his order, went to the back,then came back to explain they don't get many requests for decaf and they like to brew their coffee fresh, and it will be about a 3 minute wait. We very much appreciated his communication and explanation! The kitchen window is open to the dining area. I was able to watch and hear the four gentleman in the kitchen cooking and preparing food. The lead cook was very polite and respectful to the other cooks. He used please and thank you. He was never frazzled or loud. The restaurant filled up quickly after our arrival and several orders were put in at the same time.  My husband ordered waffles with sausage and gravy. The gravy had a sage flavor that was unexpected and delicious. I ordered waffles and chicken. The chicken was delicious, but the waffle had a bitter flavor probably from the pecans in the waffle and atop the waffle. One son ordered the Breakfast magic waffle with bacon, egg, cheese and a side of home fries. Our youngest son ordered The Carnivore Omlette- three different meats and cheese. Also accompanied by a side of \"home fries\". OH, for the LOVE of home fries! These home fries were amazing! They used purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, and a white potato that has a bit of purple in it, onion and green pepper. Each was chunked in perfect bite size, flavored with salt and pepper and other seasonings. Each meal was served on large heavy square or rectangular plates. They were garnished decoratively and pleasing to the eye.  The restaurant decor was the perfect shade of orange, not too bright! It was accented simply with black and stainless steel. A few simple breakfast photos hung on the wall above the kitchen pass through. The refreshing simplicity of the decor we were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful the food presentation was. Well done!",

They brought out a TON of sample plates for everyone to try, and then we got to pick an item from the menu. We tried savory, sweet, and seasonal waffles, some vegan and vegetarian options, and their home fries. Everything was really good. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my husband got the Caprese omelet. They were both awesome! My chicken and waffles was HUGE, so I had leftovers for the next day which is always a plus. I may have even eaten them cold, and they were still delicious. I will definitely be back!",

It was busy which I found confusing due to the experience it seemed like myself and everyone else was having, my only explanation for that would be that it is walking distance to many downtown hotels and thus a go-to for out of towners.

Both were super delicious.  This morning after grabbing coffee at a local spot a coworker was hungry for brekkie and asked if I'd want to split something. When she said WafflesINC I couldn't refuse. We decided on the Megaberry waffle which is a waffle stuffed with raspberries and blueberries. Talk about a taste explosion for the mouth. Woah! It's also topped with more berries, whipped cream and vanilla sauce. The waffles are cooked to perfection with a lightness that doesn't make them hard or crunchy.  Splitting this was definitely the way to go since it's pretty filling. Yay for having a location downtown though I'm not sure it's good for the old waistline! The interior is orange and I mean orange! Orange fast food style booth seating and not much in the way of decor at all. Very basic. But hey the food is good and that's alright by me.",

What a welcoming space. The owner is so nice and just seems to be looking to serve his customers. He also has a great staff that was hard at work and very efficient.   I tried both the vegan waffles with berries and the southern waffles that had chicken, fried egg and sausage gravy. The vegan was so good and I think I will be back to just have full order of that! What a great surprise. I tried the southern style waffles, but truthfully, I've had the chicken and waffles before and so I wanted to try something new with the gravy and egg but just the plain is probably my favorite. Although the gravy and egg version was delicious there is something so good about the plain chicken and waffles with the bourbon syrup that is just wonderful.   Well done on the new location and I am looking forward to going more often that it is conveniently located in the old Kauffman's/Macy building.",

    "text": "Went to Waffles INCAFFEINATED for a yelp elite event where were able to try a much of different items of the menu. The real sleeper item was the home fries. Multicolored potatoes with peppers and onions crispy and fluffy to perfection! They also offered three types of syrup: classic, bourbon (very bourbon-y!) and vanilla (simple syrup) The gumbo waffle with ice cream was a bit strange to learn about but very good! Also all of the sweet waffles were nice... but again how could you go wrong?! The reason I'm giving four stars is two fold:  Firstly the waffles were not very crispy. They were more soft and one textured. I would have loved a nice crispy exterior.  Secondly, the Benny (my off the menu pick for the night) was more bland than I would have liked. The hollandaise was very rich but one noted. That and the creamy egg and soft waffle led to a less dynamic experience than I would have hoped. Subbing in bacon for the ham and adding some pepper or chives or something would have upped the dish. They also offer a variety of espresso drinks but do not have a real espresso machine so they aren't great but hey do offer almond and soy milk! They also served a vegan waffle which was very good! I would never have thought it was vegan!",

But it was rubbery, terrible and tho they advertise vegan, they don't have vegan butter. Not sure - but I highly doubt - their maple syrup is real maple syrup. It didn't have the taste or texture of it. The only saving grace is here my server was super sweet, nice and accommodating. I guess if you're in to junk food all the time - this is the place for you. If you're looking for a special treat - go somewhere else.",

The portion size was larger than I anticipated.  The French toast is large portions of Italian bread cooked in a waffle iron in their own egg batter mix. Sprinkled lightly with cinnamon, covered in fruit (they do requests) their own butter that isnt like anything you've tasted. Then they bring warmed syrup to the table. The food was amazing. I couldn't get enough! I will be bragging about this restaurant and will return!!!",

Downtown Pittsburgh is definitely lacking more casual breakfast options and this place fits the bill.  While the waffles and wait staff are awesome the only thing that really throws me off is the intense traffic cone orange paint on the wall. Not that should sway you away from coming here but I was totally weirded out by bright orange walls. Orange is just a weird color in a restaurant to begin with but hey I'm not the designer or the painter. I'm just someone that eats food and writes long reviews that who knows if you're reading at this point. I'll say this come for the waffles stay away from the orange walls and you'll have a good morning.",

Been to another location before, so it was nice already having an idea of what to expect.  Friend ordered their Benny and asked for the crab meat to be on the side.  What's hot - Layout.  Decent waiting space.  It's the front corner of the restaurant with seating benches, which is helpful.  This location is in the heart of downtown, which guarantees rush hours, which is why I'm happy there is a decent waiting area.   - Menu.  I like the variety.  There are many breakfast options- sweet and savory options, crepes, omelettes, fruity options, etc...  it's nice to have options to accommodate what mood I'm in and/or what type of breakfast food I'm craving.   - Quality.  Yummers!  The pico de gallo was fresh and spicy, which added to the flavor.  The salsa wasn't overly spicy, but enough of a kick, which was great.  The crab meat that was on my friend's Benny was delicious- not too sweet or briney.  There's a good amount of crab meat, too- around the size of your fist.  The eggs were nicely poached and the yolks runny.  The fruit salad was pretty fresh.  The fruits were pieces oranges, pineapple, strawberries, grapes, apple, and pear.  With the exception of the pineapple, the rest of the fruit seemed fresh.  I also didn't taste the extra sweetness of added sugar in the fruit salad, which I liked. - Take away.  While I was waiting, a couple customers came in to pick up their orders.  They only waited a few minutes to pay and for their food to be wrapped up.  From what I could tell, it looked like the food was prepared fresh and wasn't just sitting around.  It's nice to see this, because it's an additional option.    What's not - Price.  Many of their dishes don't come with a side, which I don't like.  Sides cost extra. - Order mistake.  I ordered the veggie omelette and that's definitely not what I got.  I'm not certain how there was any confusion.  I didn't bring up the mistake, which is my bad.  At least it was yummy. - Be prepared for it to be busy, because of the location.  Final answer Plan on coming back again.",

    "text": "I LOVE Waffles INCaffeinated. My first couple of experiences were at the South Side location, but the Downtown one is much more convenient for me. The food quality is great and I always love a good latte from this place. I'm giving five stars because I've always been truly satisfied with the food. The one thing that could be improved is the service.  The past 2 times I have gone there (both in April 2019) the restaurant has seemed a bit understaffed. I had to wait about 20 minutes each time, which wasn't unexpected because I went at peak hours. However, the person taking names was so overwhelmingly busy, he didn't take out names down for about 10 minutes and we were just waiting there confused for a while. The communication between the staff and the customers could be improved, but as always, the food was great.",

Even though the place has been opened for over a month.  We decided to go here to try something different out. Everything is about the Waffle, and that's a great idea. But maybe provide a better-made waffle, and chicken to go with it. The waffles easily could have been from Sam's Club, along with Tyson's chicken.  The service was friendly, and good at her job. But she mentioned that the syrup they had two different bottles. One in which was bourben syrup, and the other was regular. Well the syrup came out like it was water. I've never seen any type of syrup come out so thin before.   I had the chicken and waffles. The waitress said I would love this place the best. But I didn't. It had zero taste to it. If it wasn't for the pecans, it would have been like eating air. I will not go back.",

    "text": "Recently attended a yelp elite event here.  I was surprised to find out that they have a pretty extensive menu, and beyond breakfast waffles they have inventive \"brinner\" (breakfast-dinner) waffle creations.  Our servers were quick, and exceptionally friendly they really wanted us to have a good time. My Yelp friends and I really enjoyed our experience and everyone seemed to love the food. I really enjoyed the sampler waffle plate- getting to try a bit of everything. Having both savory and sweet combination is genius. The waffles are really fluffy and flavorful here.  For my own meal, I was really undecided between sweet and savory, so it was great that they had options for satisfying both cravings!  The chicken and waffles came with 4 crispy fried chicken tenders with a pecan waffle with lots of candied pecans and savory green onions on top. I was surprised at how delicious it was. The chicken was so juicy and the breading was both sweet and peppery.  Fun additional that they have 3 different flavors of syrup: Traditional Maple, Vanilla and Bourbon. Maybe a label on the bottle would encourage guests to try them?  Hopefully they will spruce up the space a bit. When I visited the space was obviously still under construction and needed finishing (although I learned that they had been open for a few months?!). The orange walls as is are overpowering. Hopefully soft layered decor elements will be brought in to break it up, to offer a more inviting atmosphere.",

    "text": "Waffles INCaffeinated offers a huge range of selections - some great, some okay, and a few that I think needs a little bit of reworking. Their waffles are solid, but I feel that way at best and at the end of the day, a simple waffle cannot get better without changing up the recipe a bit. As a result I felt that the waffles were a bit plain and did not match some of the dishes as well as they could have. For example, perhaps adding little chunks of salt crystals in the waffles to complement the friend chicken in \"chicken and waffles\" (just an idea...). Their \"funky monkey\" waffles comprises peanut butter, chocolate sauce, and bananas on waffles which overall is a great, but the huge lob of peanut butter was placed on the waffle in a big clump. Because their peanut butter was rather pasty, it was difficult to spread it around and made the dish slightly tedious to eat and imbalanced. One suggestion is to add ice cream to vary textures e.g. peanut butter ice cream and chocolate sauce or vice versa.  I think they're 3 greatest highlights are 1) their syrups 2) fried potatoes and 3) service was amazing! The syrups are simple and flavors really stand out! And for the fried potatoes....they are probably my favorite thing on their entire menu (to be fair I really enjoy carbs). The exterior is fried to a crisp, but the interior is still light and fluffy, almost like potato puffs.  Overall, if I wanted a solid waffle this would be the place I'd go, but this isn't something that I crave often.",

If not for that, I'm not sure I'd be down to try popular places like Waffles, INCaffeinated, even tho I have absolutely stood in line for longer periods. But I digress.  One of the best things they have on this menu is the goat cheese. Creamy, delicious goat cheese. As far as I'm concerned every menu should include goat cheese. Well at Waffles, INCaffeinated, you can get a mushroom and chevre omelette...so I did. I added red onion and spinach and I was in omelette heaven. I paired this delightful omelette with home fries, and it comes with a slice of roasted tomato. The home fries are a-freakin-mazing, made up of carrots, sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, and green peppers, every last bite of these fries is like a gift. I followed it all up with half a waffle - yes, you can get a half a waffle here! Is that inspired or what? Well I'll tell you what's inspired - these amazingly light; crispy waffles. I am pretty sure I've never had waffles that light before - at home or out in a restaurant. Well, you pair that with their bourbon sauce and you are dancing on the ceiling. No joke. Coffee here is also a nice solid dark roast, which wraps this meal up with a big fat ribbon. Get it!  The staff here are run off their feet - it's so popular! - but they remain pleasant and efficient, which as a patron I absolutely appreciate.   Honest to god if I ever come back to this town I'm coming back here. Totally worth the calories!",

Our server was not overly attentive and we kept having to ask for things.  Food - very good. Although the restaurant has a focus on waffles, Omelettes and French Toast are two of a few alternative offerings. I ordered a waffle with \"blueberry sauce\", which I enjoyed. The waffle was light and airy. Coffee is served in small (6 oz?) mugs, so we were frequently asking for a refills.   Value - average. Breakfast came to over $30 for two.

Ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Vegetarian Delight with Egg Whites. Boy, I gotta tell you the waffles... YUM!

The chicken batter was great as well, you could taste the sweet savory-ness of the maple butter glaze and it worked well with the waffles. The only issue was that the chicken was very dry. The vegetarian delight was decent. The potatoes that came with the dish were inconsistently cut and cooked. Some were crispy and some were just soggy. There was an excessive amount of feta on the omelet. The roasted tomatoes looked great but they tasted very cold.",

    "text": "There aren't many good breakfast places in downtown on a Saturday morning so we were happy to find this cute place.   I LOVE orange, and this place is painted orange, so naturally I was happy from the start.     There are only about 20 tables, but at 9:00 on a Saturday it was packed.   Our server was decent, not great.  I ordered a decaf coffee and the coffee was excellent!!!!   Wish they used a bigger cup, as I had to keep tracking our server down for a refill.  It's probably the smallest cup I have ever seen in a restaurant.  The menu is varied, and of course there are waffles of every kind, with any kind of topping you can think of.   I opted for a BLT, which also had avocado.   It was served with chips, sprinkled with something.    The sandwich was good, not great.  The food came hot and looked nice.   I saw many other plates and everything looked yummy.    Would definitely return.  Also, if you use the yelp app, you can do an on-line check in for a spot in line.",

There must've been a body competition that weekend since there were so many bodybuilders who are getting breakfast in the morning. Actually was quite inspiring and I really enjoyed the scenery. I really was kind of overwhelmed with the menu but I ended up getting a make your own omelette with home fries and my husband got a make your own waffle with black coffee. He said it was really nice and my food was really really good. I need to customizing it to having mushrooms, onions, spinach with Swiss cheese. It was really worth the wait.",

I noticed that it took a lot longer to get our food that day than the usual fast service from Waffles Inc, but nonetheless everyone loved what they ordered. The signature cappuccinos were the hit for the table.  I had the Southern Waffle, covered in Sausage Gravy. Wish I would have paired it with a bowl of fruit to help cut down the richness of it. Loaded with sausage though and great flavor. Never been disappointed with a meal from here.",

    "text": "I had no knowledge of the fact that there was a restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh that served the ubiquitous soul food dish of Chicken and Waffles.  That is until two friends of mine said that they almost killed themselves by stuffing their faces at Waffles INCaffeinated.  What????  Waffles INCaffeinated?  I pass the place at least 4 days a week on my way home from work and for some reason, I just assumed that it was a coffee house. I already have a rotation of coffee houses that I frequent and I didn't feel the need to add a new one to the rotation.  So, I was surprised to find out that this \"coffee house\" was actually Waffles INCaffeinated.  So when I followed up on a lunch date that I promised a friend of mine, I suggested this restaurant.  My friend ordered the CHICKEN AND WAFFLE  - A Southern classic consisting of a pecan infused waffle with boneless, thick breaded, fried chicken pieces coated with a maple butter glaze and topped with scallions.  I ordered the Caprese Crab omelet with Juicy tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil, crab, and is garnished with black pepper.   I also had onions and mushrooms added to my omelet and had wheat toast with it.  Both dishes were delicious.  In fact, my friend couldn't finish the Chicken and Waffles. (He said that the dish didn't look that big on the menu and he can throw down when it comes to food.)  I, on the other hand cleared my dish and I was so glad that the omelet had a decent amount of lump crab meat. (I hate when some places open up a can of mystery crabmeat or worse, that fake wannabe surimi crabmeat.  Yech!)  My only complaint is that our waitress didn't tell me that the addition of mushrooms and onions was almost $5 and that service was a little slow.  Other than that, everything was what one of my great-nieces calls \"Easy Peasy\".  So, if you have a taste for all day breakfast/brunch food and you're in Downtown Pittsburgh, please check them out.",

And I swear to you, I cannot tell the difference between the regular one, prior to being GF.  I always want to go with the sweet and totally indulge, but I am usually here for breakfast, so I straddle the middle. I love getting raspberries inside the waffle with coconut flakes and their house made vanilla syrup. Super simple, but delicious. I also enjoy their crab Benedict waffle as well, if you want a more savory option.   Honestly, there's so many options to choose from. Between the house made creations to make your own, you could probably come up with hundreds of concoctions.   I love the fact that they're on wait list, so you can reserve your spot from your phone via the Yelp app during the busiest times. This spot is slightly hidden in the new Kaufman's building development, but so worth it!",

The waffle was soggy.  The chicken was clearly previously frozen chicken tenders from a food service company that had been fried up earlier in the day and then sat under a heat lamp.  Breading had fallen off in places and the exposed chicken underneath was dry and crusty.  I couldn't cut some pieces with a knife. Our server never checked back to see if everything was okay.  We waited so long for our lunch, I assumed everything was freshly made, but that clearly was not the case.  By the time we got our food, there would have been not enough time to have my lunch freshly made and get back to the office before my lunch hour was up, even if our server had bothered to check back on us.  Since this is not a \"two martini, expense account\" type of restaurant, they need to step up their game to get the rest of us working folk in and out with a decent lunch, because this food is not cheap.",

Since this place was right around the corner from hotel- and because another review stated this restaurant's veggie omelette was the best she'd ever had - we gave it a shot. Hubs had bacon and eggs with roasted tomatoes (also a pile of potatoes and rye toast). I couldn't help but try the veggie omelette (and I should note that in the almost 20 years I've been a pescatarian, I've eaten A LOT of veggie omelettes). Everything came out piping hot and was delicious! And the veggie omelette....drumroll....the best I've ever had! It is a delicious array of veggies, feta, and a yummy sauce on top which had just the right amount of spice! It was absolutely amazing! So between the great food (hubs was also quite pleased) and the terrific service (everyone and especially our server Jack was super friendly), this place is a winner!",

    "text": "What a great place!! Been wanting to try it for a while now, and now that one's open closer to where I live, the hubby and I ventured out to try it. Hubby had the Funky Monkey waffle with the vanilla syrup, and I had the BC breakfast,with my choice of meat(bacon), toast and two sides. I highly recommend the sauteed mushrooms and the home fries. Both were seasoned very well, and not too heavily. Our server was wonderful and made great suggestions as to the sides, as I wouldn't have tried the home fries without her suggestion. All in all, a great experience, and we will go back.",

Chicken was like frozen chicken tenders and seemed over cooked, waffle was extremely mushy (even parts untouched by gravy) and the sweet flavor in it was offputting. A completely  savory and crunchy waffle would be better. Gravy was ok but not great. Pretty expensive for what you get too (half a waffle, two chicken tenders, two eggs -- $30 for two people). Service also slow even though not that busy.",

Would have ordered something else, however I like to keep my lunches at around the $10-$11 mark at most...unless it's a special occasion, and most items on the menu were over $10.  The waffle was ok.  Probably too much chocolate as it was very sweet.  They had three choices of syrups that had the consistency of water.  My friend had the BLT.  The bacon didn't look like it was just cooked.  My guess is that it was leftover from breakfast.  The chips that came with it were soggy with grease.  The waitress offered to replace them with properly cooked chips, but my friend declined.  I would not return.  The greasy smell of my clothing, due to poor ventilation, reminded me of that all day.",

The place was clean and I thought the menu to be reasonably priced. I got the Funky Monkey, a waffle with chocolate chips and chocolate drizzle paired with sliced bananas on top. Normally, it's 11.30 but there was some promotion on Fridays that made it only $6! That was a pleasant surprise considering it was a sizable waffle. I only had to wait about 10 minutes for it to come out too. The wait staff was friendly and fast. I would definitely recommend eating here to anyone finding themselves downtown.",
