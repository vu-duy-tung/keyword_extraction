It has to be the bread that makes it but i could literally eat one every day. The inside is cute and everytime i go, there is good seating. I also love their lattes! I highly suggest giving this place a try, you wont regret!",

    "text": "I recently went to DiAnoia's after admiring the aesthetic via the internets for weeks since it had opened. I had no friends that cared to eat with me, so I stopped in during my weekly Saturday trip to the Strip District. The internet did not fail on the aesthetics...this place is adorable, light and magical feeling when you walk in. I sat at the bar and resisted with all of my strength to get a cocktail. Instead I ordered an almond latte and a prusciutto sandwich with fresh mozzarella, roasted tomato and arugula with balsamic. The sandwich is a pretty standard, simple one but...wow...the execution was superb. The ingredients were high quality and the bread is something that i could wax poetic over all day. The roll was so chewy and fresh and everything I could dream it to be. I am really excited to go back sometime and eat a bowl of pasta. If they can make a simple sandwich make me fall in love...I can only imagine what the pasta will do!",

The waitress had to ask us to repeat things 2x for everything we answered. Ordered the starter of bread with olive oil and cheese and I have to say that was amazing. I could have just ordered another and been more than happy with just that. Ordered gnocchi and grandmas spaghetti. They were out of gnocchi so had to order plain spaghetti and meatballs since my gf only saw the gnocchi as what she was in the mood for. The sauce and meatballs were pretty solid , especially if u like meatballs that are more on the sausage flavor side. My other dish was a bit different with a lot of zucchini and chunk tomatoes and some other veggies. The sauce turned into a weird orange hue and the zucchini and squash were really overcooked , too much for my liking. Nice place but I certainly won't be running back there any time soon.",

This is a bold statement but I have to say it is one of the most authentic Italian places in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is amazing and made with fresh ingredients.  I believe they have take-out pizza specials Monday through Thursday and even have breakfast pizzas on their Sunday brunch menu.  Speaking of brunch, I have been twice for Sunday brunch and it is fantastic. The menu has a nice mix of sweet and savory.  I started off with a mimosa which was delicious and served in a fun fancy glass. By the way the decor is awesome and I love the color scheme (bright blue and green) with such cool glasses and plates.  I then tried one of their chocolate filled pastries which was to die for.  We also tried their pound cake filled with lemon goodness which tasted like it was straight from a little old Italian ladies kitchen. I had food envy of our friend who ordered the French toast and will be getting that next time.  If you don't save room for dessert, this is never a problem for me, you can buy their cookies and cakes and the deli counter in the front. The prices are reasonable, service is great and I can't wait to go back for dinner!",

The bread was fresh baked pizza dough with EVOO and parmesan  and was hot, chewy and amazing. Gnocchi was pillow light with a fabulous red gravy paired with three fabulous meatballs.  My bride had the pasta with mussels and even though I am not a big fan of mussels, they were plump and perfectly cooked with a light flavorful sauce.  Escarole was the best I've ever had but could have had more greens with the sausage, beans and fennel.  I felt the portions were very ample and a great value.  Congratulations to Amy and her husband for creating a place we look forward to enjoying again and again!",

The atmosphere is great. The food is even better. It was a nice day so the garage doors were open giving it inside seating with an outside feel. A friend and I split the Brussels sprouts dish, asparagus salad and the meatball sandwich. It was all delicious and we could tell the ingredients were authentic Italian. I can't say it was better than the food in Italy but it was very close if not as good as the food on our trip! Will be coming back very soon. Highly recommend.",

Also got the branzino which was underwhelming, not at all what i was expecting given the delicious food that led up to it. Just plain sauted fish, no sauce or even seasoning (that i could taste) added. The macaroon style cookies are very good, but the donut style pastry with cream filling was a little dry (the filling was good, just not enough of it). All in all, we loved some of what we had but were not impressed with the fish especially. I think the prices are high ($8 or $9 for bread?) but the quality is very good. I'd go back for the gnocchi (I had the regular, didn't spend an extra $11 for the bread bowl, which seems like overkill).",

With the open kitchen, coffee and small \"bakery\" area opposite the dining room, I did the layout.  Service was prompt and polite.  I ordered a bloody mary which had a very fresh tomato flavor.  I can't describe it as spicy or different or unique, it was real tomato-y.  I didn't love it or hate it.  it was a very interesting flavor or not flavor, i couldn't decide.  The coffee was amazing.  I ordered the Americana simple egg plate, nothing too fancy, but very well delivered.  We also ordered the Breakfast pizza which was covered in crab. This is a changing item so make sure that you get the info from your server.  I will go back and be more adventurous, but you can't go wrong with the basics there at DiAnoia's.",

I have to say I am not a big fan at all of DiAnoia's Eatery and I am a bit disappointed as most of the reviews are really Really good??????. We had a reservation and we where seated immediately which was an excellent start. I first have to say that the selection has something to be desired as there is not a very good overall selection too choose from. I also felt that the tables where way too close and jammed on top of each other basically. I also have too complain about the noise level it was extremely loud and unpleasant too be there. I thought I was in a bar or a Fridays. The waitress finally came over and took drink orders after a while wait. I looked at menu and for me I was not happy as my favorite dish and more or less my goto dish is chicken parm which they did not have. I ordered a house salad and raviolis in red sauce. Then I am talking too my wife and asking where is the bread and butter or olive oil is??????? I have never been too any restaurant in my life that did not start you off with bread and butter or olive oil??????????. The raviolis where just ok nothing special at all and would not get them again. Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the house salad which was really good. The waitress was not very attentive maybe she had too many tables too work??? One other issue which arouse was that my wife found two hairs in her meal about 3-4 inches long, she showed the waitress and she said it was from a brush??? but did not illiterate. They did take it off the bill but still not happy. I thought the service was very slow, There was way too much noise and the food was just not that good and the selection was not good as well. Unfortunately I can not recommend DiAnoia's Eatery at all and I will not be going there anytime soon.",

The house salad was probably just okay because of my food allergy-- They couldn't put the regular dressing as I was allergic to one of the ingredients so I can't be a fair judge of it.   As far as being vegetarians, the restaurant informed us that the most popular pasta was the heirloom tomato tripoline. This pasta was simply amazing --- simple but incredibly fresh and well balanced with garlic and butter. On top of that, the gluten free option was a gluten free fettuccine. My table ordered the gnocchi which my husband was good but he actually liked my pasta dish better. The gluten feee fettuccine was unlike any other one I have tasted-- my husband couldn't even tell the difference! Amazing!   The wine I ordered was the Nero D' Avola and if you like a full bodied wine without the tannins, this is perfect. We were there late and most of the deserts sold out but my party had the tiramisu which they seemed to like. I had an almond cookie which was good and soft.   On top of all of this was the amazing service by Ralph! He made the whole experience flawless for us. Hopefully, when we are back in town, we will be back!",

    "text": "Brunch review after church on a Sunday! We had a 12:00PM reservation of four. Was actually quite busy during this time but cleared up after about an hour. There's really good natural lighting in here and their marble tables are sure to make for great food photos.  RICOTTA & LEMON PANCAKES ($10): Besides from it looking awfully dull compared to my peers' brunch picks, I should've asked for some sort of fruit topping like strawberries for a pop of color but I didn't think they'd serve me something that looked so sad :(. If you've had hot cakes from Pamela's, DiAnoia's pancakes are similar in thickness. They aren't super fluffy, but quite thin. Comes with a side of maple syrup of course. Meh. ZEPPOLE ($6): Zeh-pole-ay? Zuh-pole? Anyway, this was yummy! Similar taste to the pancakes actually. Lemon-y and a slight salty taste? (in a good way!!) Try it for yourself!  SERVICE: Good good. However, our server didn't ask if we wanted to split our check and delayed us quite a bit trying to get his attention again. Nothing that would sway my next visit.  I felt as though my expectations were a bit high after seeing a hype video on Facebook of DiAnoia's gnocchi. If I'm to visit again, I'll be sure to order the gnocchi or their breakfast pizza.",

    "text": "This review is for lunch and dinner. The best! I followed them on IG for awhile and had been meaning to check out this place for the longest time! Eventually we stopped in after walking around the strip. It was in the afternoon and saw all these delicious looking pizzas being served left and right. My first thought was, should we get the pizza? NO, not this visit. Not after years of following them on IG was I about to settle for the pizza! Ha! We thought about eating inside but it was too loud. So we gladly sat outside under the shaded tables. It was a sunny but breezy day, so I didn't mind it.   We ordered panini's!! Best. Decision. Ever!! I got the caprese and my hubby ordered the tonno. Both were refreshing and tasty! The caprese panino had the burrata cheese, which is like 10 steps above fresh mozzarella! The tonno or tuna was equally delicious. It was flavored very well, it's light and no you don't always have to add mayo to make a tuna sandwich. In this case, it was made with eggplant caponata and that's what gave this dish that lemony flavor. It was so good! Next time I'll try the pizza.  Dinner: You almost need reservations to dine in the evening. I think I booked a week in advance for a decent time for the weekend. The latest time was 5 pm, which is perfect because we usually are early eaters. It was already packed when we got there. Our server promptly greeted us as soon as we sat and was met with a big bottle of water. Just like Italy! My hearts a flutter! Oh man, I knew this was going to be a great night. Having read the menu in advance, we were ready to order. But be aware that the menu does change. Our server was also so knowledgeable with the menu she totally enhanced our meal time decisions. We were going all out! My husband and I haven't been out in awhile, this was our chance to indulge. So we order from every section.   For starters, we ordered the branzino crudo with the peach salad dish with couscous (maybe?). Fresh flat bread with cheese and oil.  For pasta we got the heirloom tomato tripoline. For this dish, the server recommended we add shrimps. Perfect!! I really wished I was home to eat this because it's that type of dish you want to curl up on your couch and slurp it up. But I wasn't so I had to eat this without looking like a piggy.  For the main course, my husband got the whole branzino. Excellent! But if you're afraid of whole fish, don't get it because they don't filet it for you. Not sure how they serve the half. I got the steak Florentine. I ordered it medium and it was so tender. I paired this with the roasted summer squash. With our dinner we got half liter of Sangiovese on tap, they served it with two short glasses, just like in Italy. Lastly, for dessert, I was full but managed to order one more thing. Cannoli, the filling was good. The cookie could have been better, almost tasted like eggroll wrapper. Sad but I'll survive. You must get the shakerato. It's espresso with your choice of amaretto, sambuca, or limoncello. I opted for limoncello. I've never had anything like it before. It was so good I definitely recommend this! I think I would have gotten another dessert but I was so full I don't think i could have eaten another bite.  Overall, the dishes and the vibe reminds me of my trips to Italy. I wish they could capture how things are so chill and slow there but it's all good. Our service was exceptional, everyone helped each other out and took good care of us. I even mistakenly got a sample of white wine. I ended up getting a glass of that too because it was cool and refreshing.  Will we be back? That's a definite YES!",

    "text": "Stopped by DiAnoia's a few nights ago to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated near the window and were greeted by a friendly waitress. We immediately ordered drinks, the house red blend for me and the amaro new fashioned for him. Both were great choices!   Next up was the appetizers: we decided on the heirloom tomato tart, fresh bread and a side of olives. Try the heirloom tart, it is outstanding!!   For our main course I got the cacio e pepe and he went for the gnocchi. Both were quite tasty, but the cacio e pepe was a little too watery for my liking.   We were so full from dinner but just HAD to get a piece of tiramisu to go. I have pretty high expectations for tiramisu, and unfortunately this one fell flat. It had an odd lemony taste to it which completely threw off the flavor profile.   All in all, I will absolutely be back!",

    "text": "Really I'd give this place 2.5 stars - I felt guilty just giving 2.  I REALLY wanted to love this place - it was good enough - just not a love connection for me.  It's a little too bright and a little too loud so I couldn't have a conversation with my hubby at our 2 top table without yelling it to him.  Also, we heard every boring word of the conversation (complete with f bombs) at the table next to us.  Crudo was excellent but I probably wouldn't get the octopus app again - I didn't expect it to be all chopped up and served cold but it was tasty enough.  I have to say the bread they served was awesome.  I got some lemon slices, squeezed it over the crudo and put it on the bead - deliciouso!  We ordered 2 glasses of the super Tuscan - one of the smallest pours I've ever seen for a glass that was not cheap so kinda bummed about that.  Hubby's half order of Branzino was good too.  I had super high hopes for  the gnocchi and meatballs-gnocchis I loved - were super fluffy - the meatballs just didn't do it for me - I was looking for the salt which was nowhere to be found on the table.   Our server was nice but was also super busy so kind of a wait for our to go boxes and finally he just brought our check.  Oh well, I guess I didn't want dessert after all so we paid and left.   Overall, I might try to give it another shot but it probably won't be my first choice.",

I'm super into their meatballs and nothing tastes as good as hearty meatballs in a fresh baked roll aka the meatball sub that I basically lived on during my pregnancy... Add melted quattro formaggio and it's ON!  I also had my baby shower here and they did an excellent job hosting. Everything I asked for was there and plentiful. The price was right too!  It has a casual atmosphere so you really feel comfortable popping open a bottle of vino or enjoying one of their many cocktails while dining on delicious Italian food. They also offer up a full espresso bar with deliciously crafted drinks that definitely have an Italian influence. My fave is the calabrian mocha, which is a mocha with a kick of spice.  Their brunch is bomb. You must get the zeppoli's. Their pizza might just be some of the best in the Burgh. I'm not a pizza crazy person, I think a lot of pizza's taste the same, but theirs far exceeds expectations. They'll be opening a dedicated pizza window soon, so stay posted on their social for that!   And DO NOT forget to grab a cookie or dessert before you leave! They have a dedicated pastry chef and their sweets are incredible. I had a cookie table at my shower and sampled each and every one of them!",

They do take reservations. A good thing yes. But it seems like once they are booked they are seriously booked. They don't leave any tables open for walk ins. You can walk in and sit at the bar but there's only about 9-10 spots.  2. They're reservations seem to book up pretty quickly. We called on a Thursday and they were already booked on Saturday.  3. While sitting at the bar I heard the hostess tell people walking in hoping to get a table that there was a 4 hour wait. I don't know if any food is worth waiting 4 hours for.   The food is amazing. Fresh and homemade. The bartender was so knowledgeable of everything on the menu. She talked about the food like she was in love with it! It made it very hard to choose but I ended up getting a house salad and the squid pasta. The salad was fresh and light. It's a nice size salad enough for 2 to share. The squid pasta was perfect. I've never had squid pasta before it was just how I would image it to be. I had a few of the potatoes that a friend ordered. They were yummy. Crunchy but soft at the same time.   I didn't have room for desert but maybe next time.",

It's very easy to get reservations here if you book online the week off.  My only qualm is that I wish they had more vegetarian options. I find the brunch is more affordable than the dinner, which I think is very expensive, especially since the gnocchi is the only substantial option for vegetarians.",

We started with the bread which was pizza dough with delicious olive oil and Parmesan sprinkled.   I love olive oil so I had to ask for more!  We decided to split three pasta dishes so we go the vodka bake, gnocchi and cacio e Pepe.  The cacio was perfectly al dente and the sauce was creamy and decedent.  The gnocchi were the best I have had, they were legit pillows, super light and heavenly.  The gnocchi came with meatballs which were hearty and delish and the red sauce was everything!  The vodka bake was very good as well, but was outshined by the other two pasta dishes.   Service was great.  We got there early and had a drink at the bar, wine list was good and the bartender was fantastic!   Overall super enjoyable meal, authentic, and simple great flavors!",

It's not impossible to find good Italian food here, but when it comes to basic Italian food, I would say the city falls short. Sometimes all you want is good sauce and al dente pasta without all the frills. Came here on Friday after a failed food experience elsewhere, and after trying to get here for about a month!   We called ahead to ask if they had any tables and they didn't but said we could sit at the bar. When we got there there were only 2 bar seats and we needed 3. The super nice hostess told us we could sit in the back where there are couches for the bakery area. Worked fine but as we sat down bar seats opened up so we snagged them instead.   Everyone in the place was really really nice. And the food, was amazing. My gnocchi had a sauce that was so similar to my Nani's I was beyond happy. We also had the Cacio E Pepe and the Linguine (my friend got it without the mussels but would have been amazing with them).   Only reason I went down a star was because I felt like they had a ton of employees but they weren't always sure what they were supposed to be doing. They weren't standing around chatting or anything, but sitting at the bar we could see the back area and some just looked confused. Also, there were at least 5 tables empty in the dining area at all points when we were there. Which I also found odd.   Regardless I can't wait to go back for brunch!",

The gnocchi itself is this light, fluffy, and large gnocchi. Definitely worth the price. The service was not very punctual but our waiter was very friendly. We were told we would get complimentary bread but we never got it. My other 2 friends got the Tripolino di Funghi and the duck tagliatelle which were also good but i likes the gnocchi the most. Other than that, it was great!",

A lot of people in my party ordered bloody Mary's and you can tell the mix is homemade! I ordered a Garibaldi, which is OJ and Campari-wow-so refreshing!  I like how they set bottles of water on the tables so that staff is not constantly going around refilling water for everyone. I ordered the lemon and ricotta pancakes and these were delicious-I just wish there was a small amount of fruit on these as is the case with the panettone French toast. The savory bread pudding was really good too! Don't forget to order the zeppole as a starter! I will be back to try dinner as this menu looks just as great as the brunch menu!",

    "text": "Made a reservation for brunch weeks in advance and still had to wait about 20 minutes before my party of 6 was seated. Rough start. When we finally were seated, our server popped by to say hello then disappeared for about 10 minutes, By this point, we were starving, and eager to order drinks. We got a carafe of mimosas (about $10 a person) and the portions were a bit on the small side.  We ordered our food and two of my friends ordered latte/ cappuccinos which did not come out for 15 minutes. The first came out about 25 mins after we were seated, the second about 30 mins after we were seated (meanwhile, they had ordered at the same time?)  The biscotti my friend had ordered did not come out with her cappuccino, we had to ask our server twice to bring it out for her. Our food arrived and was FANTASTIC! Delicious all around.  But it didn't arrive until an hour and a HALF after our reservation. We were now forced to shovel our food down, due to time restrictions we didn't anticipate, since service was so slow. The restaurant wasn't even that busy, so Im not sure what the issue was. Getting our checks took ten minutes longer than it should have as well. The food was great, but there are plenty of good places to eat in Pittsburgh. The bad service makes me hesitant to return.",

    "text": "The food is definitely above average.  I would say very good for Italian food in America.  But I've been to Italy twice and this isn't quite as good.  So I'm going to be super critical of this place.  I went with my friend whose mother is from Italy and owns a house in Abruzzo.  She got the Gnocchi with meatballs.  First thing she said after tasting it was that the sauce was too sweet.  I tasted it too, didn't think it was too sweet, but her Italian trained tastebuds weren't impressed.  The gnocchi were the size, shape and consistency of marshmallows.  Spongy and light and different than any I have every had.  I did like them.  I got the pasta dish with sausage, pine nuts and raisins in chicken stock. Unfortunately, the pasta was under done.  It was hard and almost crunchy.  Needed another minute to cook.  The flavors were ok together, but it wasn't something I would get again. My Italian friend didn't seem to like it that much either.   Then there is the whole pizza controversy.  I saw on their website that they had pizzas available for dinner on Tuesdays through Thursday to go.  I thought this was odd and asked about getting one for dinner.  The waiter said we could not order them to eat at our table, only to go.  I would have to come back for lunch if I wanted to eat one at my table or take one home and eat it cold.  It's eye-rolling policies like these that make you not want to come back at all.  However, we were able to order the $8 bread appetizer which was same pizza dough, olive oil and grated Parmesan. Which was we did and was pretty good.  My only complaint was that the middle of the bread was too thin and burnt while the outside was think and chewy.   Overall it was a nice enough, but I asked my Italian friend what she would rate it and she said B minus, 3 stars.  I'm giving it 4 because you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into the food and it's 1000 time better than anything at Olive Garden.  The atmosphere is also great. We went on a warm May night with the garage doors open and our waiter was originally from Italy and his accent was charming.  It doesn't get much better than that for atmosphere.  I may come back during lunch or brunch, but won't make a huge effort.",

While the polenta with parmigiano cheese was wonderful the veal was cold and plopped on top.  The polenta just couldn't save it!  The crispy Brussels sprouts with tallegio cheese were exceptional, as usual.  The home baked bread with whipped ricotta was lovely - we thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers.    The waiter was apologetic and said \"when you come back you might try something else more flavorful.\"  Logically, why would you continue to serve such a bland dish?  All he can do is give the info to chef, we tipped him well because he was attentive.  They did buy us dessert - an array of cookies-that were delicious!  Perhaps sticking with pasta is the way to go...sad to have duck the potholes in the menu, especially when one knows not where they are.",

So much so, that a week later I went back for brunch and again did not leave disappointed.  I don't really have much else to say other than, you need to go there and try it.  I'm not a foodie who sits and critiques the way I'm waited on, the presentation, all that crap (which by the way, both were great when I was there).  I just enjoy good food.

It was crazy busy while we were there and there (Saturday night 7pm) and there were a few large groups so the noise level was quite loud. And while our server was very nice and apologetic, the bartender was by herself behind the bar on a busy Saturday night and our waiter kept getting pulled back there to help - so our service was rather slow.  With as much exposure as this place has been getting - they simply need more than one bartender on a weekend night.

The sauce was rich but not heavy and I had veal in every bite. My husband had the gnocchi sorrentina style and was extremely happy.

In the summertime they open up the windows so it's becomes very nice and airy. I love it.",

We placed the order at the counter and picked a table of our choice. Coming to the menu, I didnot find many interesting panini options for vegetarians. So, we ended up having roasted cauliflower and whipped ricotta. Photos are available.   Roasted cauliflower is tasty. It is cauliflower with melted cheese and topped with pesto and toasted pinenuts. They are a good combination and we liked the dish especially the pinenuts! Coming to the whipped ricotta, I was impressed by the Walnut toppings on the ricotta. It is served with some toasted bread. It is unfortunate that when they served the bread it was burnt and they still decided to go ahead and serve it! But, I should also mention that they replaced it with well toasted bread (photo available) when we requested for another plate. Still, I would expect them to notice such things before they bring it to the customer's table.   Overall, for my taste preference, this is an okay place which is overrated.",

    "text": "DiAnoia's Eatery is an anchor restaurant to the Strip District. It's generally busy on any day and everyone that has been to Pittsburgh will recommend DiAnoia's! I finally got a chance to dine here, and they definitely exceeded my expectations.   Starting out, we were seated immediately by a breezy window. Drinks were always full, water was constantly refilled. A friend and I had the roasted asparagus (Provola, Bagna Cauda, Hard Boiled Duck Egg, Crispy Proscuitto), a bread side (covered in olive oil and parmesan), and for the meal we split the Potato Gnocchi, Two Meatballs, Red Sauce with Pecorino Romano.   The bread and asparagus were tasty, but had a little too much olive oil. The end of both dishes were not finished cause those bits soaked up the pool of oil. Everything we ate prior was delicious though! 95% of the dish was eaten   The GNOCCHI though - pillows of fluffy goodness, dressed in a cheesy tomato red sauce. Then I complimented each potato bite with a hunk of meatball. These meatballs are the size of my hand. Splitting the dish with a friend was enough food.   I ordered a tiramisu cake to-go. I inhaled the whole thing once I was home. DiAnoia's uses real lady fingers and soak each one with a proper amount of espresso (not wet, which is hard to achieve)!  There are a lot of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh with lots of frills, fancy dining, lots of complicated dishes with large menus. DiAnoia's keeps their dining experience grounded, simple, and creates food from simple ingredients...Like the way Italian eating should be!",

My sister came to visit and she had seen a video of the gnocchi pasta bowl on Facebook, so we decided to give it a try. Foolishly, we ALMOST each got our own, but thankfully we only ordered one bowl. We barely ate half of it  [FOOD] My sister and I were STARVING when we went, so we may have been more biased but the food was good overall. The gnocchi was soft and hot, as it was freshly made. The bowl of doughy goodness was blanketed with delicious marinara and covered in cheese. The zeppole (deep-fried dough), in my opinon, wasn't all that good. It tasted of baking soda (slightly bitter), but it was a nice way to end the night.  [SERVICE] The workers there didn't seem all too happy honestly. Though our waiter checked in on us, he never cracked a smile and oozed of impatience. Maybe it was a long night?  [ATMOSPHERE] The natural lighting in this place is insane! The place smells are fresh dough and yummy goodness. The table arrangements are really cute yet elegant. I love how everything is white with pops of color here and there. I felt fancy being there.  Would I go again? I don't see a reason not to go again -- I might try brunch -- but I'm not rushing to go back. Why? Well, the service wasn't too inviting and the food didn't necessarily have a wow-factor. But maybe I'm being a bit too harsh?",

    "text": "The food is amazing.  However the service was painfully average and completely uninspired.  I'm continually puzzled by people who choose to work in service and seem to have no desire to maximize their earnings.  If someone is drinking water or iced tea, and it's almost gone, don't force the guest to waste their breath, just GET SERVE THEM ANOTHER ONE.    There's a big difference between just serving someone and making them feel like a special guest.  If you make your guests all feel like VIP's, you're goin higher grats guaranteed.  Thank them for coming in. Smile.  This is the easiest part.  The bread at an $8 price point is possibly 7 ounces of pizza dough baked into an extremely hollow bubble that's maybe the equivalent- 3 actual dense pieces of bread; 2 orders of this was enough to give 6 people a small piece.  $16 for bread.  Salads were meticulously presented. A+  Florentine steak-t-bone is a great cut of meat and well worth the $33 price.  Likely not prime beef but this steak is easily $70+ in a white cloth steakhouse.  Seasoned perfectly, strip is served sliced w/filet on bone.  Rapini extremely bitter, needs brined? Very hard item to serve.  Pasta is simply prepared and very good.  Really the only flaw here is the service training.  It didn't seem like our server was focused on timing and overall wasn't very accommodating.  Of course this place is successful and will continue because of the attention to detail on the food, but it can't hurt to have a focus on server training.  It takes the right people that are bringing the right attitude in to work.  There's plenty of other jobs not in the service industry if you're not interested in going above and beyond for your guests.  Great food, uninspired service.",

Plus all the photos on yelp had me drooling before I could even order it. While it was certainly simple it was most definitely delicious.The flavors were amazing and it tasted so fresh.

I was greeted by a waiter that was rude when I asked him if outside seating was the only availability with a dog, and he said, \"I don't think so, but go inside before you take a table to make sure, since there's many more people ahead of you.\"   So naturally, I can't go inside because I have my dog, and the restaurant was busy, but everyone was trying to eat inside, not out. But thankfully after a few minutes, another server told me to just go ahead and take the outside seating and they'd bring me a menu.  So just from that encounter, that's the reason for my rating. Now, the food was phenomenal and the rest of the staff was super friendly. Nikki my waitress was attentive and very excited to have a table that had a dog. Because of her and the service she provided, I may return.  The food I ordered was the cow cheek ravioli and the roasted Brussels sprouts. Both combinations were scrumptious!

The cheese it's self was creamy, but the magic happens in the orzo \"nest\" surrounding the cheese. I would highly recommend. Meatballs - delicious, but if you're getting the gnocchi, skip this and get something else. No use duplicating. Bread with ricotta - phenomenal. Crispy and gluten-y all the once. The ricotta is smooth and adds another dimension to the bread. A must order!  Cacio e Pepe - simple yet flavorful. Love the lingering peppery taste. Alfredo di bufala - the pistachio and shallot combo is top notch. Gnocchi - zippy sauce with light little pasta pillows. Can't go wrong with this. Zeppoles - powdery, crispy, soft, lemony doughnuts. Get them! Cookies - I can not give you a review on all of them because I was too full (who would have guessed), but my favorite was the banana shaped shortbread cookie. Simple yet here I am, a week later, still thinking about it.  Get a few friends/couples together and order a few apps and main dishes. You won't be disappointed!",

The restaurant is in a convenient location and I was first attracted because of the outdoor seating.  During my first visit, it took a long time to be greeted outside after being sat by the hostess but the service was great besides that. However, I ordered the Gnocchi which was basically inedible. It was so extremely over cooked that it was mush. During the second trip, after again being sat outside, our server did not greet us for nearly 30 minutes. After waiting an outrageous amount of time we were finally greeted and brought water and we gave our drink order. We then waited over 5 minutes for our bar drinks which were not delivered by the server who took the order. After receiving our drinks, our server did not return for 15 minutes to take our food order at which time I just handed her my card to pay for our drinks.  Over 45 minutes we waited and only had our drinks. I will not be returning to this restaurant and do not recommend anyone wasting their time either",

If they upped their service game, they would be hard to beat.  Our reservation was for 6:15 and we rolled out of there at 10:15.  Yep, four hours.    Granted, we had a drink first, then some appetizers, dinner, and dessert with an after dinner drink so that's a few courses but we should have been out of there in three hours, tops.  The delays were around our waiter and the bar.  I'm not sure if he just wasn't picking up the bar order or the bar was backed up but, ugh.  Painfully long waits between \"waiter appears and takes order and pushes a wine bottle purchase\" and actually receiving said order - either food or drink.  We started with the crispy brussel sprouts that were OUTSTANDING.  I mean, best ever, we all agreed. The Caputo Brothers Whipped Ricotta with toasted hazelnuts and lemon was sort of bland to me but others really enjoyed it.  We would recommend that they provide at least four slices of the delicious dense bread they served it with.  It only comes with two slices and a huge bowl of the ricotta. The waiter brought more bread but then doused it in olive oil and balsamic so it wasn't good with the ricotta whip. The Escarole, Beans and Sausage could have used a ton more greens but the sausage was very tasty.  We ordered the cauliflower side but he forgot to bring it so we didn't try that.   For entrees, two of us had the Lamb Bolognese over Tagliatelle which was tremendously flavored but arrived very lukewarm which was a shame because it was downright chilled by the time our partners gnocci dishes were served.  They really need to hold the order until it is all ready and keep the pasta under a warmer or something.  We all loved the gnocci - the one served in the bread bowl was richer with the added cheese and basil while the gnocci with the meatballs and red sauce was lighter and cleaner in taste.  Really excellent flavor and unusual density.   We tried some of their cocktails and the big hit of the night was the absolutely fantastic Amaro New Fashioned which comes with two different Amaro's - Nonino and Nardini - raw cane sugar and burnt orange with cherry.  Oh. My. Gosh.  It was so good.  I was not familiar with Amaro's and was really intrigued with them.  Amaro is Italian for \"bitter\" and while these are bitter, they are also highly concentrated herbal liquors ranging in alcohol from 16-40%.  I highly recommend the New Fashioned and a sampling of the other Amaros they have to offer as an after dinner drink.  The dessert Zeppoles were warm and soft and simply delicious with out Amaro drinks.  We really enjoyed them to top off our meals.    I was intrigued with the food so I looked up the chef and he was the chef at Spoon before he opened this place.  This restaurant opened in 2016 and is a truly welcome addition to the Strip District dining scene. We'll give it another go but with lower expectations on the service.",

    "text": "True story: I almost have eaten at DiAnoia's three different times before tonight. The menu sounded good - but I was never hooked or in the 'mood' to stay. But tonight, we made reservations and went for it.   Our reservation was for 6:15 - we arrived early at 6:00pm - our table was ready, so we got seated right away. To be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the decor of the restaurant. The bar and restaurant are separate. The restaurant is clean and a simple design.   To start, we ordered a glass of wine. Their bottles are on average $55 or more- the first glass I ordered was a white wine for $9 - our waitress suggested it but I wasn't a fan. We ordered the bread and Brussel sprouts appetizer. Literally, the bread was pizza dough crust with olive oil. For $8 - it was good but not worth $8. The Brussel sprouts were good. Not worth $9.   For my entree, I ordered the Gnocchi with Meatballs- the gnocchi was the best I've ever had. Simply delicious. The meatballs were good, but I prefer my mother's meatballs. It was expensive though $18. If you want the fancy bread bowl? Add additional $11 - no thanks. I also ordered a different kind of white wine for $12. I wish this restaurant was BYOB.   For dessert, we got a rainbow cake and tiramisu to share. The rainbow cake was awful - it was so dry and there was hardly any raspberry jam in between the layers. I would not get this again. The tiramisu was good - but I've had better.   I also got an order of the cream puffs and biscotti to go. The cream puff was delicious. The biscotti was nothing to write home about.   To review - I'd go back to order the Gnocchi & Meatballs - but this restaurant is too expensive for the quality of food.",

The meatballs were also good but not great, as I didn't feel that they were super flavorful, and I've had better in the city. The tiramisu was light and delicious, with the perfect amount of coffee flavor.",

OK, it probably wasn't called that but what I was served was a pyramid of old, congealed spaghetti! Some shapes just weren't meant to be consumed and spaghetti is definitely a dish that should not be made into 3-D.  I also detected a hint of sassiness from the waiters, especially because it was slightly challenging to decide on what to have off their very hip and exciting menu! To be fair, I came with a really large group so perhaps we overwhelmed the waitstaff.  Overall, what was supposed to be a pleasant Sunday meal was ruined by a strange spaghetti block and a $50 bill for 2 people. Next time, I'll just have eggs.",

When we went before it was winter so it was comfortable in there but I will not be back until it's cold out again. It was a HOT summer day and they have ZERO air conditioning. I was literally drenched in sweat trying to enjoy my meal and it got to the point where I actually felt nauseous from being so hot I had to step outside. I couldn't wait to leave. Also the brunch drink they suggested which was some kind of orange spritz was awful. Tasted like weird, alcoholic orange pop..rather than natural orange. They also have limited seating for 2. Each time we've come here with 2 of us we've been sat in an oddly placed small table in the middle of everything, often getting bumped into. I have raved to people about their dinner but their brunch items are underwhelming and again I absolutely will not be back here until they get some AC or the cooler weather comes back.

Food wise - my friend had the vegetarian meatballs with spaghetti which I tasted which was delicious.  I had a filet of the branzino which was the perfect size for a meal.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the restaurant scene in Pittsburgh, as long as it's not Italian or at least a very specific place and I order carefully. It just isn't MY taste of real- home cooked Italian food. Thanks to a gift certificate from some real foodies, I found the Nirvana of Italian perfection in Pittsburgh - consistently prepared, seasonal, regional, beautifully and artistically presented! It's not cheap but it's worth every bite! Great atmosphere, and I love everything about it. Last night I had a calamari soup with shrimp sausage in a flavorful broth with tiny ditalini and the perfect blend of spice. They served a hearty bread infused with a delicious vinegar dressing. My husband had the Chicken Caccitorre. We don't have large appetites and we just ordered the appetizers for dinner and had no room for dessert. We have had the pastries before, and they are top notch traditional. I never had this kind of soup before but would love to be able to duplicate it. I can't stop thinking about how good it was. I noticed they have a special 7 fishes dinner, including several courses they are taking reservations for, which is the traditional Italian Christmas Eve meal. They change the menu frequently. I'm so happy we have discovered this place. It's really like a taste of home. Our next visit will be brunch. It looks awesome. Sorry we took no pictures. We were too busy eating.",

    "text": "What a great addition to the strip! We visited DiAnoia's for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. We walked in to a little bit of a line where you wait to order before sitting down. The layout of the restaurant is sorta cool. Theres a full bar when you first walk in. Comfortable enough to have coffee (they serve counter culture for all the coffee snobs out there) or a cocktail/beer. Behind the bar is an open kitchen that sits beyond the bakery side of the restaurant.   The dining room is an open concept that seems more of a lunch diner/market than night time restaurant. There was a lot if natural light with no curtains over any of the windows. The corner of the dining room has two garage doors that will surly come in handy on a nice day. The dining room was large and can easily accommodate small to large parties. There was one really large high top table which was made of a beautifully crafted single piece of wood. Large enough to fit 12 to 14 people comfortably.   Now for the food. We ordered the Veal Parmesan, sausage and peppers, turkey avocado and the Italian sub all of which were served on freshly homemade bread which we were told was made daily in house. Honestly the bread was the best part of the sandwich. For those who appreciate really good homemade bread this place is for you! Lastly we ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Each sandwich was more delicious than the next. My favorite was probably the sausage and peppers. Probably because it wasn't what I expected. The sausage was ground up smaller pieces rather than large links. The Italian had a delicious hot pepper relish on it (not too spicy) that took the sandwich to the next level.   Our food was delivered to our table within 10-15 mins of sitting down. The wait staff still seems to be working the kinks out because some of our food came out wrong. However they were super accommodating in making it right. Our pizza came our without toppings and the chef made us a whole new one (to go) the way we ordered it at no charge. So we were given two for the price of one. You just don't see service like this anymore. As if they hadn't done enough already, they gave us a box of baked goods to go as well. What a way to leave a lasting impression. They too were delicious: boscotti's, cookies, cakes etc. DiAnoia's went above and beyond to make things right when, in my opinion the food was worth the wait. I look forward to visiting for dinner!!",

    "text": "Some items are as amazing as you'd expect, given the other rave reviews. The Brussel sprouts with Parmesan and almonds were some of the best I've ever had. The branzino puttanesca was delicious except for the pasta. It was a fat spaghetti noodle (3x the diameter) that was too al dente. The fish was buttery and flaky, and the sauce had a lovely balance between tangy, briny olives and acidic tomato sauce. The hazelnut cake was perfect as well. The cake layers were only lightly sweet with the flavor of a fruity olive oil. The ganache was rich and creamy as was the light layer of icing, and there was a nice crunchy topping along the edges. Will have to go back for the gnocchi or the shellfish pasta with lemon cream sauce. Both dishes seemed to be very popular",

The interior design of the restaurant is extremely beautiful. There is a lot of lighting as well. The music was very tasteful although we couldn't hear too much of it in the dining area. Our waiter, Rod, made sure that things kept flowing all night long and did a good job in making everyone feel respected and appreciated. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their dishes. We brought tiramisu cake from outside and they were very accommodating in letting us eat the cake there. It was hard getting a reservation for 7 PM so we had to change to 5 PM but we never felt rushed to leave. Overall, everyone had a fantastic time and will be returning. Thank you for making my birthday memories so delightful",

It is weirdly not specified on the menu, but the gnocchi with meatballs is completely different from the one that comes with basil and mozzarella in the bread bowl. We had both, and the standard is large, around 2 inches square, in a red tomato sauce.  It was very good, but even better was the smaller gnocchi in the bread bowl with a creamy tomato sauce.  It is big enough to share and well worth the extra charge. My only knock here would be on the service. I am nitpicking here, but our service just wasn't on par with our meal. We felt rushed, especially at the end when we were asked if we wanted dessert as she put the check on the table, so we didn't. But, if she had been a little friendlier we would have. This aside, we will be back for sure for the food.",

    "text": "I was not only fortunate to attend a baby shower for my lovely fellow yelper friend, Rachel C., but was granted the opportunity to attend it at DiAnoia's Eatery.  While it was mid-February it was a beautiful spring-like day at the building had a garage door window that was open allowing the warm air to breeze through.  The space is gorgeous, I especially was drawn to the chandeliers, one made from wine glasses and another from beautiful bottles.    Now, onto the food, because that's what we all really want to know about.  I had a chance to meet the owner and chef and took that opportunity to ask him if he'd consider baking me into one of the meatballs.  I assured him I'd eat my way out.  This request is under consideration, but let me tell you, after one bite you too will start plotting ways to insert yourself into this delicious Italian staple.  My other favorite menu item was the pizza - thin crust with amazing seasoning and the perfect ratio of cheese.    Dessert was great.  I had what I want to call a powdered doughnut hole, but this is such an underwhelming description of the amazing ball of warm dough with the cream center and garnished in powdered sugar.   I will now be bringing everyone I know here.  And the next time someone says, \"Do you know of a good Italian eatery?\" and you don't say, \"Yes, DiAnoia's on Penn in the Strip\" I'm coming to your house and kicking you in the shin.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to visit DiAnoia's for awhile, so I went in with high expectations, and I was not disappointed.  First, let's start with the food and prices. There were 4 of us; we shared the appetizers and meals, and each had a couple drinks; we left with a $200 bill. Sounds like a lot of money, but we got a lot of food, it was all quality and the drinks were strong lol. For apps we split: the beans/sausage/greens, the meatballs, and the bread with olive oil and parm. It was all fantastic. The beans & greens weren't typical, in that they weren't in your standard broth; it was almost as if they had blended some of the beans to make a creamier sauce. It was a welcomed (and delicious) deviation from the standard. For the actual meals we each ordered: the puttanesca, risotto with veal shank, spaghetti al limone, and gnocchi Sorrentina style.  We also ordered the whole Branzino to share between all of us.  Across the board, everything was delicious and flavorful; truly homemade and authentic.  But the showstopper of the meal? Hands down, the Branzino.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The skin was crispy; the meat, flaky; and the accompaniments - garlicky roasted tomatoes and incredibly crispy potatoes - were perfect. When they brought it to the table, a couple of the surrounding tables looked over in awe.   So, everything sounds great right? So why only  4 stars? A few little things.  The service was kind of slow.  Our reservations were at 5:00, the start of dinner service. We didn't leave until about 7:15. I didn't mind TOO much because we didn't have anywhere to be until 8:00 so we had time to burn, however, over 2 hours at a restaurant for a table of 4 is a bit long. Moving on... the food in general was a BIT on the salty side. It wasn't unpleasant by any means, and I'd rather it be a little over-seasoned rather than under, but I definitely found myself drinking extra water the following day haha. Lastly, the gnocchi served Sorrentina-style is a bit misleading.  The menu says the basic gnocchi is served with meatballs, and to upgrade it to Sorrentina style, which means it's served in a bread bowl, is an extra $10. No big deal, but where it gets a little misleading is when you choose to upgrade it to the bread bowl, the gnocchi doesn't come with meatballs.  To me, $10 extra for bread, minus the meat, seems...strange? Idk, maybe it's just me.   All in all, our experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend it for some delicious Italian food. And I will definitely be back, especially to try brunch!",

    "text": "I was wavering between four and five stars, but the authenticity of the place and the hospitality of our server and management was what really did it for me! I have so much to say!  I went with for dinner with my boyfriend and another couple. As soon as we walked in, I was floored by the charming decor. Chandeliers made of glasses and bottles, a long, beautiful wooden table, a darling bar cart stocked with supplies. It felt welcoming and \"lived in\" but not messy or cramped. We started with the bread and oil - YUM! It tasted fresh but kind of smoky, in a good way. The house wine is served just like they do in Italy. It comes in a carafe and you enjoy it in small glasses. I love this - it filled me with nostalgia for my recent trip to Italy and I think it's a nice authentic touch.  For main dishes we had two orders of gnocchi with meatballs, the mussels and linguine, and the ravioli. The gnocchi and meatballs were absolutely delicious and the red sauce was SO fresh. I could pretty much drink the red sauce by the gallon. Luckily we saved a bit of bread to soak up the last bit when the gnocchi were gone!  The mussel and linguine dish was good, but not great. The mussels were cooked wonderfully, but the linguine just left a little to be desired. It was missing something - there wasn't much of a sauce to go with it. I believe the sauce was meant to be garlic and white wine, which would have been delicious if there were more flavor to it. I probably wouldn't order this again, but if I did, I would ask for extra garlic.  But the ravioli. SO GOOD YOU GUYS. They were obviously house made - two (maybe three?) huge ravioli cooked perfectly al dente with a beautiful egg yolk in the middle. Pair that with a truffle sauce and tons of yummy shrooms .... when you break into the ravioli, the egg cracks and creates the tastiest sauce EVER. My favorite dish at the table for sure.  The portion sizes are perfect. I think a lot of us are conditioned by restaurants such as the Olive Garden to believe that pasta dishes are supposed to come in dump-truck sized portions. DiAnoia's does it right - you can eat all of your pasta and still have room for dessert, which is great because their desserts are delicious! We decided to do four desserts so that we could try a variety of things. We ended up with a traditional tiramisu, cannoli, Nutella croissant, and a lemon raspberry tart. We each had our own favorite - mine being the tart. But they were all out of this world. I would honestly pop in just to grab a few of the tarts. They are so delicious!!  Our server was excellent - I forget his name but I know that he used to work at E2 and he totally rocks. A manager stopped by to check in as well, which was nice. Loved our dinner experience and I want to try it out for breakfast and lunch too! I am truly impressed by DiAnoia's and cannot wait to go back with my big Italian family!",

Extensive Amaro menu and a very educated bartender who was excellent at making recommendations and education. I believe his name was Sam.   The food was awesome. Watching the open kitchen from the bar showed that every employee was engaged and working hard. They all seemed happy. Speaks volumes about this place. Nice work creating a great culture!  Food was excellent of course.",

I got there a few minutes early to pay, and grab some drinks to take along with my pizza. While the staff was super friendly, there seemed to be a bit of a communication issue amongst them. I was waiting at the bar for forever for my pizza, and finally when one of them asked me what I was waiting for and if I was waiting on a GrubHub order I said no and that I had been in here this whole time and had already paid for my pizza. The girl said my pizza was ready the whole time and I was just standing there waiting an extra 15 minutes. There were 3 people there working the front and there was almost NO ONE in here when I went since it was after lunchtime, but doesn't seem like anyone was paying attention. So once I finally got home and had my pizza, it was good but there are also a bunch of other places I could go where I am not waiting for forever. Don't know if I would go back or not.",

    "text": "So we saw great reviews and wanted to try it. Made reservations for 4 in a Saturday. Reservation time was honored. Pizza oven was down so no bread. Then they were out of the items we wanted, whether it was drinks or food. Our server was very absent. He came initially and then disappeared for 20 minutes. We asked for recommendations and when he suggested a menu item a coworker overheard him and turned to our table and said it's good but come back next week when we have it again. Another missing item. So our server disappeared yet again and about 15 minutes later came back to finally take our order. Our apps were good, however mains where just so so. The place is so darn noisy it is ridiculous. Our server was incredibly snarky and made a smart ass comment to our guest when he remarked how he was having a hard time hearing him. That comment just pushed us over the edge. A so so experience was just edged into a very bad experience. We all are still at table while I type and agree this first trip most likely will be our last because of the service received and the many items unavailable. What a shame after high hopes for a nice dinner without the kids.",

It wasn't really obvious to me at first how things worked though. It's a really small menu, only a few things. I went with a breakfast sandwich and a cappuccino.   I thought that it seemed a little pricy just for what I ordered, but once the food came, I changed my mind. My sandwich was huge. It had prosciutto, egg and cheese and came on a hot buttery bun. It was so tasty. I never think about using prosciutto for breakfast sandwiches, but it tastes so much better than just bacon. I loved the coffee too.Definitely want to grab some more of that.",

    "text": "After months of salivating over the foodie community's Instagrams I finally made it to Pittsburgh Italian restaurant DiAnoia's Eatery. Located in the culinary hub of the Strip District, I was pleasantly surprised at how charming this spot is! I walked and immediately gushed over the chandeliers that are made of  WINE BOTTLES and WINE GLASSES!? I immediately felt at home. It's a beautiful space feeling open, clean and fresh with white walls, highlighted with unique kitschy decor. I meet my two girlfriends on a Tuesday for a 6pm reservation. After a long day at the office we were ready for wine & carbs! DiAnoias does have a lovely light white moscato (from the dessert menu hahaha). I was thrilled. We had a very sweet & charming waiter who was subjected to our gushing girl talk. He was great and added to our amazing experience. For my meal I ordered Cacio E Pepe of spaghetti, grana padano, pecorino romano, black pepper. With handmade pasta and delicious cheese it was a very fulfilling, deliciously rish dish. My friend ordered the mussels with bucatini, fennel, red pepper flake, parmigiano reggiano, white wine, garlic and butter. My camera-shy girlfriend ordered potato gnocchi, with meatballs, red sauce, and pecorino romano. For dessert I treated myself to more indulgence with a Nutella brownie and hazelnut gelato from local Shadyside Millie's Homemade Ice Cream. My brownie was certainly a treat, with warm gooey nutella and fudgey bits. I'm really glad we got to experience this charming Pittsburgh Italian restaurant. I can't wait for an opportunity to return to  DiAnoia's Eatery for dinner again,  and hopefully for Sunday brunch as well! I shared more on my blog at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoscatoismymantra.com%2Fpittsburgh-italian-dianoias-eatery%2F&s=91c119a1f3bc58d82fe94f5a7364ac59c4c7eff5253c6d74cb6f9268b1ffe1e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">moscatoismymantra.com/pi...</a>",

My boys surprised me and took me there for lunch on Mother's Day.  They had made reservations so we didn't have to wait.  The restaurant was very busy.  It took a few minutes for our server to come to our table.  He took our drink order and told us the specials.  When I looked at the menu I was sad to see that it was the brunch menu and the gnocchi that I had wanted to try was not on the menu.  I almost asked if it could be made but I didn't want my sons to know that I was disappointed since they were treating me to lunch.  I ended up ordering the breakfast pizza.  The crust was nice.  The toppings  were good.  The egg on top made it all very tasty.  It still seemed as thought it was missing something.  Maybe a brightness?  The pizza was pretty big.  I ate a couple of pieces, one of my boys at a couple of pieces and I left the rest.  Once we had our food our server only came back to give us our check.  Someone did come and give us a fresh bottle of water for the table. The food was good but not great.  The service was a bit lacking.  I was bummed.  I will, however, go back . . . .just to try the gnocchi. I'm hoping for a much different experience on the second try.  I'll post an update.",

Please make a reservation for this restaurant, if you don't have a reservation more than likely you won't be able to taste this wonderful food!  We started with a few appetizers.  We had a meat and cheese board which had an assortment of Italian cured meats and cheeses, fresh bread with fresh ricotta cheese, ravioli with lobster in it.  All of the appetizers were a banger and the various meats on the board were so good.  The fresh bread was soft and the ricotta cheese was just a great topper.  For my main entree I ordered the special which was the truffle pasta cooked in truffle butter, topped with crab meat.  This pasta dish was so good, decadent, and downright good.  For my drink I had the Rose Spritzer, which has Rose and Gin it!!! Awesome food, great service, and I'd go again.  PS:  the gnocchi is out of this world amazing, I tried some of my coworkers!!!!",

I bit the bullet and made reservations for my birthday brunch, requesting a table outside, weather permitting (and pup would come out). Reservations were confirmed, but then the morning of I get an email from the restaurant, pushing the reservation back by 15 minutes. Odd and maybe a strike 1, but I can overlook it.  We arrive and I see spots out front, so that looked good. I checked in while hubs waited with pup. They led me to a table inside and I referenced the request to sit outside.  \"It will be a while then.\"  \"I have a dog.\"  They checked into the seat, annoyed they had to honor a request I noted in making the reservation. I mentioned there is a table outside and the hostess said it was reserved for a 12 reservation. Unbelievable. Why honor some requests and not others? Strike 2.  They clear up a table outside and we sit. It doesn't have an umbrella, so pup was hiding under the table for coverage. We're hot and I'm annoyed.   We move on and order. Hubs got the biscuit and gravy and I got the prosciutto eggs benedict. The biscuit and gravy looked tasty, with tomato and herbs as ingredients baked into the biscuit. The chunks of sausages worked well. The prosciutto eggs benedict was bland as were the potatoes. Boo. As I was working on the second eggs benedict, I tasted mold. I flagged the waitress down and told her. She basically said it was impossible because \"The biscuit is made daily.\" It's an English muffin (really had to refrain from saying that) and \"It still taste like mold.\" She takes it away and hubs gives me his biscuit and gravy to eat. She comes back asking if I want anything else, but the whole experience has been disappointing. Just the check, please. Strike 3.  They didn't charge us for the eggs benedict, but she said she confirmed with the kitchen that the bread is made daily. Whether it's the English muffin, spinach, or something else, there was something wrong and I didn't want to argue anymore. I was hoping for a tasty birthday brunch in peace. Dining is as much the food as is the experience. This failed.",

It had garlic but it wasn't evenly distributed throughout. My bread was ok but was toasted too much so one bite was a loud noisy crunch and then it would crumble all over. Sometimes the sandwich tasted bland and then other bites had an ok garlic taste but I wanted more oregano and basil.  I'd like to go back and taste some other food to sure.",

However, when we left around 6:30, the place was packed so if you plan on eating dinner then, I highly recommend making a reservation on their website (it's v simple).  Initially, once we walked in, we were first seated a place with really dark lighting but asked to move closer to the windows with much much better lighting. Other than that, the place is very cute. We liked that the waitress explained the different parts of the menu to us as it was our first time at an Italian restaurant.   For the food, we ordered the calamari pasta, house salad, and the Sorento gnocchi in the bread bowl. Immediately when it came out, we felt like we had ordered too much. The bread bowl is HUGE. Honestly, we should have just ordered that and an appetizer. The good thing is that the gnocchi melts in your mouth and it is super good. We highly recommend getting this. As for the calamari pasta, we found it a bit salty but in general, it was okay and they give a good amount of calamari! For the house salad, it was great starter and you can't go wrong ordering it! The dressing isn't overwhelming either.",

The potatoes that came with the eggs were also delicious.   When you come into DiAnoia's you may forget you are in the burgh and may think you are in Italy. We all agreed we will need to return and try a dinner here .  In my opinion, this was a better Italian than the other well-known Italian resteraunt down the road.",

Right when you walk in you can tell the food is going to be great as the smells are wonderful. It's a decent sized restaurant but it is a bit on the louder side. They have a big drink menu including many unique cocktails. Our waiter was awesome, very funny and knowledgeable of the menu. We started with the bread, it was fantastic so make sure you get it. You can add whipped ricotta but we did not do this, maybe next time. The gnocchi was excellent as well, it came with two meatballs. The portion was a perfect amount. Someone I was with had the Cacio e Pepe which was also really good, would be nice if there was an option to add meatballs to it. Overall, if you're looking for some great Italian food, check this place out.",

Our waiter was extremely patient and knowledgeable about the menu. 2 of the party had been there regularly while 3 is us were new. He took his time explaining the menu and ingredients. He never seemed frustrated or annoyed, but instead seemed genuinely happy to help.   The meal was paced slowly so we could really enjoy each other's company. We ordered the fresh bread with ricotta. The bread alone was pretty incredible, but the ricotta was a game changer. It was like nothing I'd ever had before. They enjoyed another appetizer of thinly sliced fish in oil.   We all got something different, my bf and I got the gnocchi in the bread bowl and the cacio de pepe. The tomato sauce was bright, bold and fresh. The gnocchi was perfect and the bread bowl was the perfect addition. The cacio de Pepe was creamy, cheesy with a bit of bite from the pepper. The pats was perfectly cooked. Everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their entrees as well.   We finished the evening with various cookies and the fresh zeppoli. I've had zeppoli from the chain Italian restaurant so was caught off guard when our ordered arrived. While they looked different and tasted different then I was expecting, they were SO much better than I could have ever dreamed of.   The whole evening was incredible. The only downfall is that so many other people enjoy it too, which makes it incredibly loud and hard to have a conversation in.",

    "text": "I finally got my opportunity to experience this Italian restaurant. I arrived a little early before they were serving lunch but they were happy to accommodate me. They do serve a limited breakfast selection but they have a very tempting group of inviting pastries all made in house.  Free WiFi is available and they are part of the coffee passport if some of your favorite coffee places are listed on it. They have beautiful artwork and some merchandise for sale including pasta and tea.  I was given the lunch menu and told to order at the counter. Once I completed that then take a seat anywhere in the main restaurant. Since it was a beautiful day they had the front windows open to give you that dining outside feeling.  I wanted the eggplant Parmesan panini. I was told it was huge so I deferred ordering anything else. I was told it would take about 10 minutes to prepare and my name would be called. Not long after the man who took my order brought it out to me and asked me to pay when I leave. I thanked him and was glad this was the only thing I ordered. This sandwich was indeed very big and quite filing! It seemed a little lukewarm  in a spot or two but it was cooked through and through and I really enjoyed it.  As a matter of fact this panini alone was just under $10.00! Not bad for a sandwich this size. DiAnoia's is also featured on grubhub so that you can order in advance for either delivery or takeout.  This is a very popular restaurant and gets crowded quickly. Reservations can only be made for dinner but for me getting there right before it opened for lunch was perfect. No long waits, great food, and good prices.",

I really liked the atmosphere here, as it's on a corner lot with more of an open concept. The dining room is surrounded by large windows, which makes it quite comfortable for a cold winter day. Bar area (coffee bar for breakfast) was also quite open and not a bad place to wait out a table or grab a quick drink/bite. Look forward to returning for dinner or another breakfast.",

The coffee drinks and pastries are intriguing so I can't wait to try to those but I was there for a dinner. We didn't have reservations so we were lucky to snag one of the cafe tables by the door (would recommend making reservations to be in the dining room for future reference). We started with wine and the fresh bread with Parmesan. It's a pizza dough slathered in grated Parmesan and olive oil, it was good but I would rather fill up more on pasta next time. I ordered the Cacio de pepe as it was my favorite dish in Italy. It did not disappoint- I felt like I was back in Rome enjoying homemade pasta with a subtle but flavorful sauce. I would probably get this dish over and over and count on my dining partners to allow me to try a few bites of whichever pasta they ordered. I definitely don't think you can wrong and I would highly recommend bringing any Italian food loving friends here.",

Service wasn't the best (ex: took about 5 minutes for our server to greet us, people who brought the food out set my friends food in front of me and she got mine, and we didn't get any utensils). Nothing was a deal breaker, just something to work on. Ordered a cocktail and it tasted yummy. I would like to go back to try some pasta next time.",

I went with two other people and we ordered a variety of food to share. We started off with the cheese and meat plate for our appetizer, it was very good. There was about 4 different types of meat and 4 different cheeses. Then we got the gnocchi, ravioli, and a side of meatballs for our dinner. It was all very tasty, the ravioli was my favorite. I finished off my dinner with homemade limoncello which was also amazing. I'll definitely be back.",

The rest of our table had: 1. Gnocchi in a bread bowl (incredible.  I traded bites of steak for this and was so glad I did). 2. Branzino fish (Probably the best fish I've had in the US.  The lemon pepper flavors that came through were a perfect compliment to this buttery, moist fish). 3. Salad and pasta whose names I didn't catch, but were equally divine.  Seriously, the food cannot be beat!  The atmosphere can be a little off putting as the dining area is brightly lit and a bit boisterous, but hey, that's authentic italian!  Pass on the tiramisu.  It wasn't bad, but save your calories for the main courses!",

Lunch is a delicious, no frills affair that allows you to order from the counter.  Every entree I've had at dinner has been flavorful, fresh, and well balances (particularly the gnocchi, it is what dreams are made of, get it if it's on the menu).  The space is crisp and clean, with great windows for people watching.  Only complaints: it does get very loud (lots of hard services that would benefit from some sound baffling), food is a bit pricey to make this a regular spot, and their draft selection is very limited.",

But compares well does not mean it is as good as what I've had in Bologna, Naples, Sicily, or Tuscany.  The pizza, particularly with rocket and proscuitto, it very good as are the soups and salads. The place is clean, bright, and the service is friendly-- I would eat here more often if I lived closer.  But, while a wonderful place to lunch or have a very good dinner, it is not a special place where one would celebrate an event or special occasion. On further thought,  I don't think DiAnoia's tries to be one of those places, which is okay.",

The beans and greens is phenomenal. Rich with layers of flavor. My fiance had the burrata, which was also very good. Both starters arrived quickly and the beans were nice and hot.   Got the Steak Florentine next. The meat is probably not authentic to what they use in Italy, but still a nice cut. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Very delicious. The Roasted Potatoes are also great... crispy and rich.   Our server Sam was great. Portions are fair for the price. Overall, this is a promising new spot. Plenty of good beers by the bottle as well.",

    "text": "Extremely Disappointed.  After seeing this establishment on Facebook (featuring their famous gnocchi bread bowls), my friends and I immediately made a reservation for 7:30 pm on a Friday night. When we arrived, we were welcomed by a gracious hostess and seated almost immediately. To our surprise, the restaurant was pretty empty and after we sat down, our waitress informed us that they were out of gnocchi already. AT 7:30 PM! This was incredibly surprising given that they start dinner at 5:00 PM. We only came for the gnocchi bread bowls so we debated leaving. But the waitress told us that we couldn't go wrong with any of the other meals, so we stayed and ordered something different. This was a lie.  We started out with the Meat and Cheese platter, which was very good and came in a large portion (given the $32 price tag). We then ordered our meals. We got the lemon ravioli, the duck tagliatelle, crispy polenta, and the cacio de pepe. All the meals were average at best. My friend couldn't even finish the lemon ravioli because she was eating a literal lemon. It was so sour I thought they wanted to recreate the sensation of a lemon head. After barely finishing our meals, we waited for a very long time for our server to take our plates away and hand us our checks. We saw her chatting with the other kitchen workers behind the cash register and had to chase down another waiter to get our checks. Our waitress finally came back and delivered our checks to us while admitting that she 'forgot' about our table.   Overall, this place is not what it is hyped up to be. I don't understand the high reviews this place gets since their service is disappointing and their food even more so.",

The pasta was done perfectly which is the biggest deal to me.  The table shared the house marinated olives, Brussel sprouts, and fresh bread.  SO worth it!  I have to get the bread and olives every time I go!  I ordered a negroni for a cocktail and it tasted perfect.  I also had a glass of wine with dinner.  Even though we did not order dessert, it was my friend's birthday and they brought him a cookie with a candle in it which was so thoughtful and sweet.  Our server was excellent too.

We are big Italian food fans, so comparing with some of other Italian restaurants that we have tried, this one is maybe average.  The Gnocchi is their favorite dish, flavor was good, but too much potato, it was too mushy, we ordered the sorrentina style, the bread taste really good with nice texture, but the gnocchi was just not.  I had the Spaghetti Del Mare, spaghetti was a little too hard for me (but some people may prefer), and not enough Lobster/crab meat to make it amazing.  But the chilled asparagus soup, meat balls, and butter garlic scampi were great!",

I ordered a house salad and spaghetti and meatballs.  The salad is different - a good variety of leafy greens, some garbanzo beans, some little olives, grape tomatoes, cucumbers - all drizzled with a unique, house dressing.  It's a small salad, but it's very good.  Now the pasta dish...  The spaghetti noodles were chewy and quite good.  The sauce, however, was orange, a little sweet, and just not what I expected.  The meatballs (two per serving) were very good and larger than a golf-ball.  Combined with the rest of the dish, it was decent, but not great, not amazing.  I say some pizzas they were boxing up and they looked really good.  Next time, I'll go with the pizza.  Service was very nice, helpful, and friendly.",

Perfection! For lunch I had the roasted cauliflower and meatballs. Both were fantastic but the cauli was OUTSTANDING. Do not pass it up- that topping is everything.  Husband had a prosciutto panini- it was huge and very good. After the zeppole he could only eat half, so the rest came home with us. Would love to come back for the evening atmosphere.

Hubs and I stopped by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the History Center.  I was starving and heard this place was legit.  One look at the menu and I knew a meatball panini was coming my way.  Hubs ordered the veal parm panini which would have been my second choice.  Oh the happiness to come!  I was SHOCKED at the size of the meatballs... They were the size of tennis balls!  This fresh crusty bread with San Marzano tomato sauce, and cheese to top it off made me salivate.  I couldn't dig in fast enough.  I couldn't fit the sandwich in my mouth, so I dug in with a knife and fork.  I am not ashamed!  The light and flavorful meatballs were so good they would make an Italian grandma jealous!  The fresh bread that crunched with every bite gave the perfect amount of texture.  I wish I took a photo of the cheese pull!    After scarfing this delicious sandwich, I definitely need to schedule a reservation for dinner.  I've seen photos of the gnocchi bowls...   To be continued ...",

So delicious, when you first opened I was able to get in there before 8 am to try the breakfast sandwich & zeppoles.  I miss the early hours! I haven't tried dinner yet but can't wait ! I'm sure it won't disappoint. Also saw online the rainbow cookies --- another New Jersey item that's hard to find here! So glad a place like this fame to Pittsburgh",

    "text": "I'm really surprised because I've been here a few times and I couldn't see any of my past reviews. Have I totally lost my mind and not written one? Am I getting so old that I think that I do stuff but I really don't? All things that I ask myself when thinking about my delicious meal here.  I will say that I went for brunch and I made a reservation beforehand. They're usually super busy on a Sunday for brunch so if you are looking to just pop in it might not work out the best for you. But try, maybe you can get a table. But the good thing about Yelp is now you can make a reservation right from your Yelp app for this restaurant which worked really well for me for that Sunday brunch.  So we got seated right away, which I would assume would happen since we did have reservations, but our food took a while to get to us because the kitchen was very backed up. The wait staff did tell us about this but only 20 minutes into the 50-minute wait. The food was really good when it came out at least mine was but it was a long time to wait for brunch.  I ordered the iced latte with a shot of vanilla and it was phenomenal. Just the perfect amount of vanilla and the coffee was brewed to perfection. I hate how some places have iced coffee that's so bitter but they try to mask with the taste of sugar. This coffee had none of that aftertaste of weirdness.   I also ordered the Nutella stuffed pastry and it was very good. My only complaint is with myself because I did not read the menu correctly and I thought that they were going to be little Nutella stuffed donuts and not the Nutella stuffed calzone that it was. But this was my bad. I wanted something that was more finger food and this had to be cut with a knife and a lot of Nutella spilled out. So while delicious it could have been a little bit better if it was little donuts dipped in Nutella like my mind had it. But that's my fault again for not reading the menu. But if they have an idea of what they want to add little donuts that you can dip in Nutella would be a great addition to the menu.   And then for this time I ordered the eggs in the sauce. I actually cannot remember what it's called so I need to look it up so one second. Okay was called eggs in purgatory. So on the menu it said that the eggs would be poached in sauce and served with a side of bread. The problem was is that I don't know if the sauce was too hot or if it's sat in there for too long but the eggs were not poached eggs they were basically hard-boiled by the time that I got them. Not what I was expecting, but still good. The dish was also way too hot to eat for a while and that added to the time that it took for us to eat breakfast. So while good not really what I was expecting or what I wanted. The bread that came with it was super fresh and the sauce that the eggs were hard-boiled in was really really good too. But I was expecting poached eggs and those were not poached eggs. And maybe they started out poached but because of the heat of the sauce at just cook them way too much. That's something for me to ask next time I go in.  Like I said it's been a few times that I've visited here and I've always enjoyed myself. I will say that Sundays are quite loud and busy. But the food is worth it. Just know to read the menu and to ask questions about what you're getting. I don't think that you'll be disappointed. Because even though my meal wasn't exactly what I wanted this time, it was still delicious and I ate all of it.",

There was a quite a line already when we arrived, but it moved quickly and there were plenty of tables to choose from once we placed our order.   My lunch date and I shared the large order of meatballs and I had a taste of the panzanella salad, both of which were superb. So flavorful with such fresh ingredients! The space, during the day, is filled with light and a pleasant buzz (not too loud inside, which is nice for lunch conversation!)  The desserts in the glass counter were calling to me seductively as I waited in line to order and pay, but I managed to pass this time. I'm already counting down the days til I can come back for dinner and splurge on a sweet treat for dessert!",

She took the time to explain the nuances in some of the wine and offered samples to make sure we like what we were getting.     Then it was off to the table.  The server there was mostly efficient, but I wouldn't have described him as welcoming or friendly.  He did answer questions and make suggestions, but I am pretty sure he never smiled once the entire time we were there.   The pace of service was a little slow at the end, but was good throughout.   We had several separate checks and he accommodated that without error or complaint.     The food.   We sampled a whole bunch of different dishes.  The burrata raviolis, brussels sprouts, arrancini, cauliflower, whipped ricotta, fresh bread, and zeppoles were all absolutely delicious.   They also made great leftovers.    Surprisingly, two of the more popular dishes according to Yelp got an \"eh\" from me - the gnocchi and the cacio e pepe.   The gnocchi was soft and pillowy, but it almost bore too much resemblance to mashed potatoes for me.   The cacio e pepe might just have been me.  It's not a go-to dish for me and this was no different.    As far as value, I'd say the place is average.  The wine pours were pretty light, so I had to buy an extra glass to feel satisfied.   Also, while the fresh bread is pretty darned special, I didn't dig paying $8 for it.  I'd much rather have that built into their concept or at least reduced a bit.        Overall, I'd go back and totally over-order to have some yummy leftovers.",

    "text": "I still stand behind my 5 star review. If you want to be guaranteed a table for brunch or dinner, do yourself a favor and make those reservations ASAP! I've stopped in 4 times since my last review. Once for brunch, once for dinner and twice for lunch!  For brunch I ordered the eggs benny that came with prosciutto and breakfast potatoes and my mom ordered the breakfast pizza. The pizza came topped with kale, ricotta, pancetta, fried egg and the cherry pepper relish. Both of these dishes were delish! I also ordered the maple dirty chai to go with biscotti. There is nothing like homemade biscotti dipped in a latte.   The two times we came in for lunch we ordered a cheese pizza. Let me start by saying this pizza is probably tied for the best pizza in the burgh. When you can taste the freshness of the tomato sauce and right amount of herbs/Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top you know it's good. The dough is fresh and cooked to perfection. Their pizza stands out from the rest and makes my Italian heart happy! We also got zeppole (fried ricotta Italian doughnut balls) to-go. They make these babies fresh to order and they come out nice and warm tossed in powdered sugar (insert drooling emoji here).   My girlfriends and I came here for dinner one night after work. They bring out fresh bread and oil to start you off. Since I'm Italian and I LOVE bread, I ordered the gnocchi bread bowl. It is worth every penny. The gnocchi are quite large, but yet soft and light. One thing I absolutely love about DiAnoia's is how fresh everything tastes. From the gnocchi to the sauce to the bread. This bread bowl is extra cheesy too. I highly recommend if you are looking for a staple Italian dish. Now go mangia!",

At first the pasta seemed a little underdone but then the cream sauce just soaked in and it became perfect. My husband had the Octopus pasta, which is VERY strongly flavored with the Uni sauce, but was also delicious. The whipped ricotta appetizer was creamy and perfect and probably would be a perfect dessert even - it was so rich! The only minor, MINOR complaint I had was that the tiramisu is extremely strong on the espresso flavor and was lacking in creaminess; it was a little grainy. But I still enjoyed it and the Amaro selection that our server helped us with was perfection. I wouldn't have known how to pick an after-dinner Amaro without his help, but I LOVED the one I got, and my husband loved his as well. We'll be back for brunch!",

When I arrived, I enjoyed the decor and found the atmosphere pleasant.  However, I was extremely disappointed when it came time to try the food. The cacio e pepe was essentially spaghetti (which came from a box) with a heaping of pecorino on top and a teaspoon of pepper-- extremely unauthentic and flavorless; even the pecorino was tasteless which speaks to the quality of the ingredients.  Additionally, the other dishes I tried were just as disappointing. The texture of the gnocchi was fine, however the sauce tasted like pureed tomatoes from a can. I hoped that maybe the tiramisu would somewhat rectify the tragedies that were the main courses but, alas, it did not. The ladyfingers were not properly soaked and there was barely enough mascarpone to taste and, therefore, the tiramisu tasted more like desert than a dessert. The only dish that I somewhat enjoyed were the crispy brussels sprouts.  Overall, I am very sad to say that I was extremely disappointed in DiAnoia's food, and that the quality v price of the restaurant is awful. If you would like authentic Italian food, you are better off following a recipe at home.",

My gf and I have both traveled to Italy and we both agree that this was the best gnocchi we have ever had! They are huge, fluffy pillows that melt in your mouth. The meatballs and sauce in the dish were also incredible! I know the menu may change, but if this is on the menu GET IT!  For dessert we split a brownie with nutella frosting.

I read an article about how the owners wanted to bring a New York/Long Island style deli to the burgh so I was very excited being that I am from Long Island. We went here today for breakfast bc I saw they have  breakfast sandwiches on kaiser rolls!! However I was disappointed that it wasn't the same type of soft kaiser roll I am used to seeing in NY- but it was still tasty. I got the pastry affagato which was delicious. Next time I'll come for dinner. Only suggestion is that the coffee is self serve for sugar and creamer, and it was only in one section by the bar/door. We ate in,so our drinks came served to our table but then we had to go back to the back to the bar area to add cream or sugar which was a little inconvenient carrying a hot heavy cup. Maybe add a self serve coffee table in the dining room area?",

The pizza is absolutely top notch. Crispy, thin crust and the fresh basil finish just makes an all around great bite. The bar has a great drink menu, I am a fan of the negroni and the house wine on tap.  After we absolutely stuffed ourselves with pizza and hoagies, we were offered to try their home made cookies, of course they were also amazing!  The food here is so good that you're stuffed but you really don't want to stop eating. When you take the time to do things from scratch, the right way it really does show!",

Took a while for the food to come but at a place like this it's a good thing, the food is very filling so the time in between an appetizer like the bread with olive oil and a meal like the gnocchi was perfectly timed. I ate the gnocchi in literally 2 minutes though it was good and I was super hungry haha. The cauliflower and pine nuts was great, also had a glass of the house red blend wine which was very reasonably priced at 7.50 I think. It's available in multiple quantities made by the owners just down the street and brought over in huge barrels to be kept on draft. I enjoyed it. Save room for the \"doughnuts,\" I forget what the Italian name for them is but you get four fresh hot deep fried doughy little things covered in powdered sugar. While you're at it have a chai tea latte with your dessert, it's one of the most genuine chai lattes I've had. So good. Can't wait to try something new next time. Also I recommend making a reservation the place can get busy.",

The service is also excellent.  Our waitress was to the point but very good at her job and clearly was concerned about making sure that everything was perfect.   In terms of food, we started by sharing the Italian doughnuts and ricotta pancakes.  The doughnuts were fresh and tasty but nothing spectacular however the pancakes were excellent.  For my meal I ordered the frittata with stew meat, however, since they were out of beef they substituted crab.  It was tasty but a little too crabby/fishy in flavor than I would have liked.  My wife had the eggs with arbiatta sauce which I tried and thought were excellent.  I would love to come back here for dinner sometime soon.",

For our entrees we had the tagliatelle, the ravioli, and the gnocchi. They were all fabulous. I personally had the gnocchi, they were like little fluffy clouds of perfection. The red sauce that accompanied them was so fresh and flavorful. The only thing I didn't love about our experience was the lighting in the restaurant. It's a huge space so I understand the challenges of lighting it properly but we were there at 8:45pm and it was so bright in there I though it was noon. And that was enough for me. It to do the full 5 stars because it really took me out of the atmosphere of having a great late night dinner on the weekends.",

We appreciated that there weren't obnoxious portions, and especially appreciated the homemade pasta and bread.  Red sauce is very good, and I nearly never say that. Lots of love in the food.  The burrata antipasto was exceptional, even if the bread was a little too thick.  Our service was very good and friendly, and we appreciated how clean the restaurant was. The marble tables are not inviting, and I'd say the ambiance is on the cold side. The choice of wine glass is odd, and almost childlike.  It is an extremely small pour-definitely the smallest I've ever had at a restaurant.  At any rate, we wish them luck, and will be back to try many of the inviting menu choices.  Perhaps we'll go for brunch!",

    "text": "My first yelp review because I've never left an  Italian restaurant hungry before.   I was surprised at the limited menu.   Admittedly I have simple tastes, but nothing appealed to me in the salads.   I was thinking a Caesar side salad but they don't have it.   I looked for an entree and was hoping for chicken parm or baked ziti, but they don't have it.   I settled on the gnocchi and meatballs.   It was good but the gnocchi wasn't nearly as hearty as I'd hoped for and there was no option for a side of pasta.   How is this possible in an Italian restaurant?  So I sat awhile and even looked at the menu again and was hoping for a slice or maybe even a small pizza because they were cooking them right in front of me and they smelled and looked really good,  but they're only available for carryout!",

The best part was that it wasn't hipster pretentious. So many restaurants in Pittsburgh now have to put an ironic twist on whatever cuisine they are doing. Not so here - it was a modern, fresh take on Italian in a simple setting. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "My husband and I met some friends here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. The place was located close to the end of The Strip District, away from the hustle and bustle of the main portion of Penn Ave. The exterior of the building was simple - bright blue lettering that popped against a white backdrop. On street parking can be found along various side streets.   Upon walking into the restaurant, there was a bar situated to the left side. It was full of people enjoying various brunch beverages and cocktails. We were seated in the far right corner and were able to take in the rest of the restaurant. The lighting was made of recycled wine glasses and bottles, designed to look like chandeliers. The old glass garage doors provided additional lighting as the brightness was accentuated by the white walls.   Our waiter was instantly present to serve us. He provided us with filled glasses of water and a glass container of water for the table for refills. The menu was specific to brunch (this applies to all Sundays) and contained a variety of unique items. We did not partake in any of the starters which included creative donuts/fried dough, and a yogurt parfait. For my entree, I settled on the Veggie Scramble which included eggs, provolone, mushrooms, onions, red peppers, creamed spinach and a side of fried potatoes. The potatoes were outstanding - heavily seasoned with a crunch. The scramble was perfectly cooked with a nice amount of each vegetable incorporated into it. My husband ordered the featured breakfast pizza which included shaved pork belly, pesto, cheese, onions, chickpeas and a fried egg. It was so good! The flavors of the herbs and seasonings pleasantly meshed on the pallet. I was not a huge fan of the crust but that is never high on my list to begin with.   Overall, I was satisfied with our meals and the place. I would love to come back and try additional items on their menu! The atmosphere was inviting, the staff was friendly, the price was a typical brunch (higher but good quality), and the food was good.",

The gnocchi is so cheesy and the tomato cream sauce pairs so well with the bread bowl. It's a good thing the bowl is edible because you will be craving more of the gnocchi as soon as you are finished!   Some important notes: 1. The bread bowl is shareable! I shared it with a friend and we still had some leftovers.  2. If you love carbs, this restaurant is perfect for you 3. There are so many other delicious items on the menu, I can't wait to come back and try them",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in DiAnoia's Eatery the last time we were in Pittsburgh for a quick drink. Nice experience, but not really enough to warrant a review. I'm so glad I had the chance to go back last night with my friends/colleagues!   The restaurant was packed, on a Tuesday! Luckily, we had reservations so there wasn't a wait. Our server (not sure about his name) was really sweet and patient. It had been a while since we were last together and we had so much to talk about, we ended up at the table for over three hours. I so appreciated not feeling rushed!   We started with the ricotta and bread, which was actually more like a giant pizza crust, topped liberally with olive oil and parmesan. Awesome, and impossible to resist for a carb lover like myself! I rounded things out with the house salad, which was topped with a delicious oregano vinaigrette, salty olives and chickpeas. Great start to the meal!    My friends opted for pasta entrees which were massive! I tried my friend's gluten free pasta and wouldn't have known the difference between that and regular pasta. I opted for the half portion of branzino, which was served over roasted tomatoes and crispy potatoes. My dinner would have been fairly light if not for all that bread I ate... and did I mention the cookies?!  My friend (a Pittsburgh local) advised that DiAnoia's bakery is one of the best, and she wasn't kidding. I opted for an Italian wedding cookie which was super dense, so buttery, flecked with nuts and topped with a dusting of powdered sugar. I had a chocolate chip cookie as well but the wedding cookie was superb.   My only gripe is actually one I saw mentioned in another review. We were seated at one of the middle tables and my chair was pretty close to one at the table next to us. A couple of the servers (not ours) walked between the chairs, bumping into them, rather than simply walking a few extra feet around the table. After several bumps, I pushed my chair out a bit to make the space too small to pass through. It wasn't a problem again but a customer shouldn't have to create a force field to avoid being bumped by staff. Certainly not something that would ever prevent me from dining here again; just a suggestion for improvement. Otherwise, great meal, great night and definitely going in on that gnocchi bread bowl next time!",

There is plenty I'd street parking and also a few spots located at the rear of the restaurant.    The place was super busy and our service at the bar was timely.  We started off with the fresh baked bread and opted for the $4 whipped ricotta. O.M.G. it was delicious. I could eat the ricotta by itself! Mind you the second we finished the bread they brought us a plate on complimentary bread with oil lol. A little bit of a card overload. Not sure I would have ordered the bread had I known we were getting more.  I ordered the squash ravioli and it was fantastic. Perfectly tender bites if filled pasta that were surrounded with all kinds of pancetta, hazelnuts and brussel sprouts. The sage butter was the perfect way to tie all the harvest flavors together. The plate also looked so pretty with all the colors it fall.  My husband had the gnocchi and meatballs. The pasta was tender, the meatballs were flavorful and the sauce was your typical Italian red sauce. Not too sweet and not too tomato forward.   Would have loved dessert but after all the bread we had to pass. Saw the tiramisu pass by us a couple times and it looked pretty tasty!",

Arrived a little early for our Tuesday 7:30 reservation to a packed restaurant but managed to get a great rec'd from the bartender for a couple glasses of wine. We were even seated early which was a surprise considering how busy the place was. Started dinner with the cannelloni (which was the best I've ever had!) and the bread with oil & parm. For dinner we shared the Cacio e Pepe, the Ragu di Cervo, and meatballs with sauce. Simply amazing. The difference between fresh, house-made pasta and everything else is...well...just eat here and you'll see. We ended the meal by snagging the last piece of almond butter cake with chocolate icing. Our server was the sweetest and took great care of us!  Go. Bring great company and your appetite. But make a reservation.",

We started off with the bread which was light yet tasty. I ordered the pappardelle for my main and took half of it home for left overs. The flavors were great and the noodles were soft. I tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi (sorrentina style)- unreal!! The gnocchi were like little clouds in your mouth. I will say that I wish that they had a half size portion of the gnocchi (sorrentina style). For $30 it's quite expensive. While you definitely get great quality food and a bread bowl, it's a very large portion for one meal and a lot of money. My Aperol Spritz was good too!  I will say that service was a little slow. We waited a long time to order and for the food to come.   Overall, I highly recommend DiAnoia's for dinner. I hope to try their brunch/lunch soon.",

No hellos, or sorry it took 10 minutes to get to your table, just a curt \"What do you want?\" WTF ok... that's cool. Hello to you too. It took us 15 minutes to get our first drinks..  Another 40 minutes passed waiting for food. He did not come to check in, take our second drink orders, or to say the kitchen is backed up. I tried to flag down the waiter, but he just never paid attention and kept walking past our raised hands. I gave up and talked to the hostess and asked for our check.  The waiter then gives us the check of ~$100, literally NO apologies or asking us what was wrong, or we'll have the food out for you to take home soon. He just walks away.  WTF?! Well, the food sounded delicious, but we never ate it...  We talked to the manager. She got rid of check/ gave drinks on the house. I'm not at all mad about waiting 1 hour for food. 1 hour wait is worth the food i've tried here.  I understand kitchens could be backed up. I've been here before and had great service (slow but with a terrific waitress), food, and time during the busy holiday season.  If he had stopped at our table at least one more time to say kitchen is backed up or take a second order of drinks, I would have been content with waiting and with the terrific food.  Last night's service was atrocious, really below subpar-  I have never seen that in the restaurant industry, no less from a decent high end establishment like this one. Long wait is fine, just don't be a dick to your customers. Lots of rough technical issues (i.e. backed up kitchen) can be smoothed over by good customer-waiter interactions. He clearly did not understand that nuance.  I appreciate the management's quick action to amend the wrongs, but regardless, they should not have let this happen in the first place.",

The dishes are straightforward but elevated due to the quality of ingredients and preparation of the dishes. Another reason I love it here, they have EVERYTHING!

    "text": "I'm going to agree with the general consensus that DiAnoia's is one of the best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. I would describe everything about DiAnoia's as simple, from the decor to the food. However, they know how to do simple right, which makes it such a wonderful experience to dine here.   All the pastas are made in-house and you can really taste the quality. I can specifically attest to he gnocchi and the pappardelle. My husband ordered the Pork Sugo Pappardelle and I got the Gnocchi, Sorentina Style (bread bowl). Both dishes were phenomenal, but personally, I'm partial to the gnocchi in the bread bowl. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, melt in your mouth and was paired with a delightful cream sauce. Not to mention the delicious bread bowl, which was kind of like a buttery pizza dough. Because my dish was straight carbs, we also ordered the Escarole, Beans & Sausage which were among the best greens and beans I've ever had! To end the night, we shared a tiramisu which was perfect.   I can't wait to come back to DiAnoia's, specifically to try the zeppoles and brunch menu! Although you can count on me to definitely return for dinner!",

We have friends that work at this restaurant and by other previous friends visits it's a place that is a must visit for an amazing meal   So tip number one:  if you are having dinner and have a larger party (more than 3) it's best to make a reservation   The place is not too shabby as far as capacity is concerned, but it seems to be a new gem or a new exploited spot. We were seated at the bar, and the wait was barely scratching 20mins   Service was great from the hostess to the bar tenders...  So as we sit, the gents were preparing drinks, but oh my what drinks.   They were beautiful, and he were working the \"bar tending\".  Talk about, they better hit the gym after the shift to keep rocking those muscles... they were literally doing the cha-cha w the mix-ecology they were prepping ... anyway a must see !!!  Out meal was superb!!!! We started w pulpo fritta (baby octopus fried) what a flavor and super tender !!! Main course were Gnocchi a la primavera and a gnocchi in a pizza-bread bowl!!! And the desserts were out of this world = zeppolis and tiramisu.  The zeppo's were soooo soft and they melted in your mouth, nothing like I have ever tasted before and the tiramisu is house made w a hint of orange.  It was all on point!!!!  Must visit!!!!",

I was worried about our big party (party of 9) but there is an amazing long wooden table that seated all of us comfortably.  The staff is friendly and very attentive to the needs of their customers! They served our food to us with a warm greeting and a genuine smile.  My Turkey panini with avocados and arugula tasted fresh and was a pretty decent portion! I finished a little over half and had the rest for a later meal! Others in the group had spaghetti and meatballs, sausage sandwich, meatball panini, and the mortadella and ndujo panini.  Brief one (or two) liners: Mortadella and ndujo panini: \"super savory and delectable, & great crunch on the Kaiser roll\" Meatball panini: the meatballs were above my expectations Spaghetti and meatballs: \"tastes authentically Italian, coming from a Filipino family. The meatballs could've used just a little bit more seasoning\" Sausage sandwich: - will have to update later, because we took them to go -",

When it was 5pm they acted very odd and asked if we would mind not sitting at the table they promised (??). They eventually sat us at a table then told us we were on the clock and could only have the table for an hour. They took forever to give us menus/serve us so it became a little stressful to try to order & eat in this bizarre hour window. It made our experience not as relaxing as I would have liked. It felt like we were being punished haha. And we had to woof down all of our food.  My fiance and I ordered the special mushroom dish of the night & the gnocchi. Both were fantastic. Our waitress was so kind and recommended a fabulous glass of wine. Prices were reasonable. We would definitely go back, but I wouldn't go without a reservation as it made the night more stressful than necessary.   Overall, the food is great and I would definitely recommend!",

I got the Zeppole (Italian doughnuts), and they were soooo melt in your mouth delicious!! GET THE ZEPPOLE! I got the prosciutto benedict, and every aspect was perfect- potatoes, hollandaise sauce, and runny poached egg. The European breakfast is a fun charcuterie spread with meats and cheeses on a board. The breakfast pizza was fantastic too! The restaurant itself is so open and modern. Has a great, cool American take on Italian vibe. I love the giant open garage door window letting in so much natural light and fresh air. I highly recommend checking it out!!!  Parking tip- private lot was full so I parked at the Cork Factory Parking garage at 24th street. 0-2 hours $2, 4-6 hours $4. Walking around the strip district was a good activity after a big brunch.",

In my opinion, this is as high-quality, authentic Italian as you can get in Pittsburgh, which has no shortage of Italian restaurants.   You can't beat the greens and beans as a starter and the cacio e pepe for your meal. Classic Italian dishes prepared extremely well and in fair portions.

The second time I went for lunch and ordered the house salad and a cup of minestrone soup. The house salad was decent and the soup was pretty good, but there was a broken piece of plastic in the soup. My friends shared a pizza and I have to say, it looked really good! I might be willing to forget about the incident with the plastic and give the pizza a try sometime.",

The weather Tuesday night was horrible but we were not letting that stop us. There was a good size crowd there at 630 when we arrived and the place completely filled up while we were there. It was a great atmosphere. We both ordered the perfect martini and it was really unique and tasty.   Everything on the menu looked delicious so we both decide to order off the regular menu instead of the restaurant week special. We ordered the whipped ricotta appetizer which came with a couple slices of delicious bread. We ate the slices quick so the waiter brought us a plate with more which was great. For entrees I ordered the Cacio e Pepe and my sister got a pasta dish with red sauce and anchovies can't remember the name. We also got the side of cauliflower to share. Everything was really good and satisfying. We kept eating but still had so much left to take home which I always appreciate. Our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions.   Overall our experience was excellent and I can't wait to go back. I especially want to try their brunch and pizza. I would definitely recommend DiAnoias to anyone looking for great Italian food down in the Strip District!",

    "text": "Made a reservation (a must here even on weeknight). We arrived five minutes early, but were still seated 15 minutes after our reservation. Normally Its the party ahead of you taking their time but the reason became very clear that it was the service. While our server was nice and informative, they appeared to be a little short handed because we were not able to put our appetizer order in for another 20 minutes (about to eat the napkins at this point). All in all for a two course meal, it took us two hours. Great for a weekend but not ideal for a unsuspecting weeknight. So be sure you are not in a hurry when you come here! Now onto the food:  The olive oil bread: resembles a giant pita because it is hollow inside. Tasty because its bread but if you are between appetizers, go with something more unique.   Arancini Appetizer: three very tasty fried risotto balls. Very cheesy and very delicious.   Braised duck pasta with mint: very light and very mild. Great for someone who wants pasta but doesnt want something very heavy.   Braised veal entree: My favorite. For about the same price as the pastas, you get a lot more meat. The polenta is awesome.   Gnocchi with meatballs: gnocchi perfectly cooked. The meatballs make it extremely filling so it's definitely a lot of food without the bread bowl.   Lamb pasta: my favorite of the pastas. Red sauce but meaty and all the flavors combine well.   So the food was superb to say the least.   We ordered a liter of the draft wine and it was not good. Nor was it that much cheaper to just get a bottle of something you know that you would like. Skip the draft wine.",

This is my pick for upscale lunch where we can take our toddler and put her in a high chair while we pretend we're still adults with lives that can go out and enjoy good meals. For what it's worth: she loved the mushrooms on the pizza.  Everything I've had there (breakfast sandwiches, cookies, that really cheesy cauliflower dish, and their huge lunch sandwiches) has been fantastic. I hope they have broken the \"wedding world\" building curse and will be in the Strip for years to come.",

    "text": "This weekend I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to go to this adorable Italian restaurant, located at the tail-end of the Strip District. Seeing that it was a beautiful Saturday night, my group and I were told that we had to wait for about an hour and a half to eat. We were far too excited to eat here, so we accepted the challenge. Tip: get a reservation, if you can.   First, the atmosphere in this joint is impeccable. If you couldn't tell by the font on the sign, it has this vintage-yet-modern freshness that feels both fancy and dressed down. In the entrance, there is a beautiful coffee bar/delicatessen that functions primarily during the daylight hours, and to the side is a fancier dining room with eccentric pieces--like the glass-bottle chandeliers-- to offset the clean natural vibe given off by the natural wood tables and wicker chairs.   Second, the food is EVEN MORE impeccable than the atmosphere. To start, we ordered the fresh bread with oil and cheese. It arrives at your table looking like a heaping bubble of hot dough, and when you pop the air bubble, it settles down to a warm pizza crust without the toppings. One word: life-changing. My friends and I were about to cry when we finished it, we just wanted more.   When our entrees arrived, my friends ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the primavera. I can't speak for my friends, but their plates were clean within minutes, which made it seem like the gnocchi was to die for.  The primavera was delicious as well. I tend to like things spicier, so I added hot pepper flakes, but I would recommend more salt and pepper in this dish as well. The vegetable pairings in the dish were delicious. There were fava beans, some sort of larger root vegetable that I couldn't identify, and peas, among others. I especially enjoyed the peas, and the walnuts were an interesting flavor to add to the dish. I would eat this again for sure. In fact, I'm craving it as we speak.   After dinner, my friend ordered the tiramisu while I went for the tri-color cookies-- an Italian staple to end the night. The rainbow cookies were not as soft as I remembered them to be, but nonetheless I gobbled it right up. My friend enjoyed her tiramisu, and her Snapchat friends were quite jealous when she added a picture of it to her story.   Upon leaving this restaurant, I told every friend and family member I came in contact with to try this place immediately. I am here to tell you that you MUST as well. It was life changing.",

    "text": "DiAnoia's remains one of my favorites! Since my first brunch post, I have returned 2 times for dinner and didn't know I could fall in love with it even more! Similar to my brunch visit, both times I came for dinner, I had amazing service from our waitresses. Their service has been the best that I have received in Pittsburgh in a long time! Both dinner visits I split the escarole, beans, and sausage. This is a must!! It is unlike any beans and greens dish that I have ever had, super creamy and delicious. I will continue to get this dish each time I visit! Last night, I also tried the fresh bread and the cauliflower. Amazing!  For entrees... no surprise.. I HAD to try the Gnocchi Sorrentina style. Best. Gnocchi. Ever. and the bread bowl doesn't hurt either! Chris and I shared this meal and there was still enough for us to bring home and have leftovers.  Last night, I had a new pasta dish that was recently added (I'm assuming for the summer menu). I don't remember the name but it was rigatoni with squash, lemon, pesto, and stracciantella (apparently some kind of amazing and delicious Italian cheese similar to burata) You guessed it.... simple, flavorful, and AMAZING! Looking forward to coming back again and again! Mangia!",

    "text": "The Pittsburgh restaurant community has continued to flourish in the decade or so I've been eating around here, and DiAnoia's is another solid addition to the food scene, adding a \"must have\" location to the outskirts of the Strip District.  Before I get to the food, I have to give a nod to the atmosphere at DiAnoia's.  Unlike some of the dull and drab food venues, the eating space is bright and inviting.  The blue wordmark is a great compliment to the high-reaching white walls, and the large lounge chairs and displays give it a very comforting feel inside.  Whether you're in the dining room or sitting right at the coffee bar, the space feels open, even when there isn't an empty seat in the house.  Now to the good stuff:  the food.  In my multiple visits to DiAnoia's, I've had the breakfast sandwich (which is crazy good), the panetonne french toast, the breakfast pizza, the lemon and ricotta pancakes, and the veal parmesan.  Every meal has been delicious, striking that fine line between satisfied and filled-to-capacity, something I run into at many other establishments.  Maybe that's why I always have just enough room for dessert!  My last visit, the waitress (also from the Poconos, represent) suggested a homemade cookie plate, all which were made in house.  Add a glass of whole milk and it was the perfect punctuation on a busy brunch service.  Even though they were getting packed up early on a Sunday, the service was incredibly courteous and attentive.  Also, do yourself a favor and order the zeppoles!  You will NOT be disappointed.  Good food is worth waiting for, so if you're the impatient type, do yourself a favor and make a reservation.  I got stuck waiting all of 3 minutes without a reservation before, but as it continues to grow in popularity (rightfully so), you can avoid any inconvenience by making one.  All in all, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, a quick drink, or anything in between, DiAnoia's is a great spot to experience one of the new and best restaurants Pittsburgh has to offer.",

    "text": "I have been excited to try Di Anoias since I heard it was opening, and it did not disappoint! I have tried their dinner and breakfast, and both meals were delicious.   For breakfast, I had the egg sandwich and added sausage to it. You can add pretty much any meat you want to it if you would want something else. The sandwich was much larger than the average breakfast sandwich and was topped with a very runny egg and lots of cheese.  My boyfriend ordered the breakfast pizza, which was loaded with egg, vegetables, and meats on a thin pizza crust. He also got the Italian donuts, which tasted like funnel cake, but very soft on the inside. Our favorite was probably the breakfast sandwich, but everything was good!   My boyfriend also ordered the Calabrian mocha, which I do NOT recommend. It was so spicy that we couldn't even drink it. Cool concept, but just didn't work. They have a lot of coffee options that I am hoping will be better.   For dinner, I had the half chicken and the house salad. The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I would highly recommend getting the half chicken and not the full, since it ended up lasting for 2 extra meals because there was so much to it. The house salad was the MVP of the night- the olives and oregano dressing made it the best salad I have ever had.  My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi. The sauce was incredible. The meatball was a little over seasoned but still very good. This meal does not give you much though for the price.   The atmosphere in Di Anoias is also wonderful. It's very open and bright and has very unique decor.   Definitely recommend! You won't be disappointed.",

It was a cold, deli type hoagie vs a warm, grilled sandwich. It was also pretty tasteless (the \"Squirrel Cage\" has an Italian hoagie that costs around half of the $12 I paid for this \"panini\". And it comes with chips). However, my daughter liked her tomato basil soup and side salad. So, the lesson is don't expect a traditional \"panini\" if you order one.",

We got the appetizer special for the evening which was fresh ricotta they just got in from Philly, topped with a lemon glaze and hazelnuts, served with toasted bread. For and entree I got the Tripoline which was fantastic. And dessert we sampled a bit of everything! They also gave us complimentary after dinner drinks. Shoutout to Sam for making wonderful recommendations for us! I really appreciate an establishment that delivers not only excellent food, but service as well. This is a must for those who haven't had the chance to try out this place yet. Can't wait to go back!",

The server that we had was someone I've had from E2 and he does not disappoint. We started off with this delicious oil & bread.

When we got there, we were told the party before us came late so we'd have to wait a bit to be seated. No big deal, my friends and I all work in the service industry and completely understood. However, it took like 45 minutes for us to finally be seated. Our server came over after about ten minutes and chatted for a second, then said she'd be back to take our drink orders and was gone before we could stop her to say we were ready. When she came back fifteen minutes later, we ordered everything all at once. I got a cappuccino that was so yummy and some chocolate biscotti. Not sure if they make it in-house (assuming they do) but it is DELICIOUS. Unfortunately it took us about an hour to get our appetizer and entree all at once. I'm happy I had the biscotti to tide me over. I got the ricotta and lemon pancakes and a side of the parmesan prosciutto bread pudding. Honestly, I could have just done with the bread pudding because of how dense it was, and it was incredible. The pancakes were okay, I guess I'm not used to the texture of a ricotta pancake, it was a little mushier than I would have preferred, but I passed it around and my friends enjoyed them! All in all, I would love to come back and give this place another try when it's not as busy. Food gets 4 stars, service gets 2.5.",

Coming from a large Italian family the food was atrocious. The options that were given for the tiers may have been some of the worst food choices on the menu. No one was able to order any of the options they would have liked on the menu due to the only options of a family style dinner. Horrible prices. Horrible service. Horrible food. Go to a reputable Italian restaurant if you visit Pittsburgh. This is a poor attempt at food from a culture with a rich history in the area. Terrible.",

UNTIL...you try the breakfast sandwich and doughnuts from DiAnoia's Eatery.  When I tell you it's the BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had, I'm not exaggerating.  I sat at the bar/counter area on a Saturday morning and was feeling a little indecisive on just how to construct my breakfast, so I left it up to my server...and he nailed it.  A slab of spicy sausage topped with a runny egg and cheese...all sandwiched between a soft, fresh brioche bun. It was perfection.  I tend to lean more towards bacon when I order breakfast, but the spices in the sausage, combined with a perfectly cooked egg (not overdone and rubbery like so many other places) could not have been better.  Balance that out with the sweetness of the Zeppole (italian doughnuts) and you are on your way to having a very very good day.  DiAnoia's is a very welcome addition to the Strip District neighborhood...but just far enough away from the craziness that it maintains the neighborhood cafe feel.  I can't wait to try out lunch and dinner as well.  Welcome to the neighborhood DiAnoia's!",

For dinner I ordered the cacio e peppe which was awesome! Creamy but not too rich. Just amazing. My husband ordered the gnocchi. It was the best gnocchi I've ever tasted. It literally melted in your mouth. We both opted to get them \"sorrentina style\" which is in a bread bowl. Definitely overindulgent and unnecessary but it was amazing.

    "text": "Full disclosure: this review was written last fall and somehow never posted.   I wish I could do separate reviews for different meals. I have been here four times since they opened, twice for dinner, once for breakfast, and once for lunch. On the whole, the food is good to great. Breakfast and lunch are definitely their strengths, and their pizza and sandwiches are spectacular.   Dinner is solid, but nothing I'd write home about. The bolognese is the way to go for pasta. I didn't enjoy the greens and beans; they were a little strange and didn't resemble anything I'm accustomed to, but perhaps this is a preference thing. The tiramisu struck me as a little soggy, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. We both agreed that the bread and oil was the best part of the meal.   I would really like to give this place more stars, but what knocked it down for me was the service. Both times I have been here for dinner the staff was less than satisfactory. On my first visit during restaurant week, service was terribly slow for the number of customers present, and the request to split the check was met with extreme annoyance. (Full disclosure: I recognize this can be inconvenient for servers, but it was a table full of ladies. They split out one friend's check as she has a nut allergy and they brought the check with candied almonds. While this was very considerate, I'm not sure why the server wouldn't have asked if they are able to separate our checks as well.)   On my second visit, a double date before a concert, the service was again slow. Our waitress was much better, but the manager/bartender (?not sure what her official title is) was very condescending. We ordered after dinner drinks and my friend's contained a fraction of everyone else's (we ordered the same thing) and didn't look anything like the others. When she asked if the drink could be remade, the bar manager returned with the same drink to explain that this drink was made as it was supposed to be and was what my friend had ordered. My friend has extensive bartending experience (and not just at 'a beer and a shot' kind of places, but legitimate cocktail bars), so she knew this was incorrect, but by that point we were in a rush to get to the show (again, slow service) and didn't have time to argue further. Highly recommend the breakfast and brunch scene here, but I'd scope out other options for dinner if you're craving Italian.",

The atmosphere was very unenjoyable and our server barely spoke English. He treated us like we were idiots that have never dined out before.   My main course was the Rye Rigotti--looked as disgusting as it tasted. It appeared to be a bowl of slop that tasted like dirty dishwater.   Truly a horrible experience.   I definitely do not recommend. Nothing like the photos or reputation. We won't be back.",

The pasta was fresh, made in house. It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of bite. The portions are larger than many fine dining establishments. The pricing is very reasonable. You pay for a nice portion of good quality food. When I go out I like to choose items that I won't make at home... they have plenty of creative dishes to choose from. Also, they made delightful mock tails for us. The flourless chocolate cake had a little hint of almond that was just right. We will be back!!!",

    "text": "Gotta update (is it still an update if it's still 5 stars?) my brunch review after visiting DiAnoia's for dinner last night and having another phenomenal meal and experience... and I am really not ever one to choose to eat at Italian restaurants/rarely ever eat pasta.  After grabbing a drink at the bar, our reservation was ready and we were seated. We were lucky enough to have JP as our server again and he, to no surprise, took great care of us.  You can really tell the staff here enjoys the atmosphere and is proud of their level of service and quality of food and drinks they serve. JP, again, provided great recommendations and engaged with us in a fun, but not overbearing way.  We placed an order for the house salad and the escarole, beans and sausage to start and it was brought out with yummy bread. I would definitely recommend the beans and greens again, but would maybe try a different vegetable dish in place of the house salad - though it was fresh with olives, tomatoes, house Italian dressing and chick peas.  For my meal, I ordered the gnocchi with meatballs and he had the taglitelle agnello (pasta in a lamb bolognese sauce).  Our dishes came out piping hot and were literally mouth-watering good.  The pasta was fresh, cooked to perfection, not heavy at all and the gnocchi was so light and airy and delicious.  The flavor was absolutely perfect and I am so happy we both had leftovers to take home and enjoy again!!  We had another round of drinks while we ate and I ordered the martini perfecto and my date had a Peroni.  My martini was good, but not what I had expected.  I was looking for something along the lines of a more traditional dirty martini.  I am glad to have tried another cocktail off of the menu, but I probably would not order it again (just not my style).  Because we were there for a celebration dinner, and even after we declined, JP was nice enough to bring out what he told us was his favorite dessert - a cream-filled pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I highly suggest, regardless of how full you are, ordering this and devouring it there or taking it to go because it was the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  Truly one of the better places to eat in Pittsburgh and one of my new go-to recommendations to people that ask.  Thanks DiAnoias!",

Buy yourself a bottle of wine, order the greens and beans, a side of fresh bread, and the gnocchi and meatballs. You won't find a better meal on this side of the Atlantic.  Thank me later.",

I am a carb lover so I couldn't get enough of this. I had the Gnocchi bowl and if you've seen a picture of it, it absolutely tastes as good as it looks!  My friend has the Orrecchiette pasta and said that it was delicious. The only thing that I dislike about this place is how close the tables are. It kind of ruins the vibe in my opinion.

The Gnocchi bowl was certainly worth the hype...we enjoyed it so much that we did not even touch the Taglialoni at the restaurant (although, when eaten leftover, was incredibly creamy and delish)!

    "text": "DiAnoia's Eatery is an amazing addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene!! I had heard great things about it and was so excited to come here for the first time in April for my birthday.  The dinner started out poorly for personal reasons - I lost my wallet at the Carnegie Museum beforehand! - so I knew this restaurant was amazing when it turned my frown upside down. We started with the fresh bread with oil and parmigiano reggiano, which was absolutely delectable. The bread tastes like amazing pizza crust made from the freshest ingredients in a little cafe in Italy. We quickly gobbled up every last morsel. For my entree, I ordered the potato gnocchi which was covered in meatballs and a classic red sauce. The gnocchi was perfectly fluffy, and the sauce was light and flavorful, the perfect complement to the hearty meatballs. For dessert, I selected the tiramisu. It was a classic, alcohol-soaked treat. I'm sad to say that I like less alcoholic, Americanized tiramisu a little bit better, but this dessert pays homage to the Italian original. In addition to the amazing food, the service was excellent. Our waiter was very polite and efficient, and our food was prompt.  During our meal in April, I suggested that we bring our guests visiting in June to the restaurant! I am so happy to say that we did. This time, we tried DiAnoia's for Sunday brunch and were not disappointed. Sometimes, a restaurant serves either delicious brunch or dinner, but this restaurant shines for both. We started with trying the stuffed cornetti, Nutella panzerotti, and zeppole. I would have never tried the stuffed cornetti, but my brother-in-law (who's of Italian descent and has family from Pennsylvania) couldn't stop raving about how much he loved Lebanon bologna. All three of the starters were amazing, but I have to say that the zeppole was my favorite of the incredible options. These little Italian doughnuts were perfectly doughy and lemony. For my main dish, I tried the Lemon & Ricotta pancakes and had a few bites of my husband's Steak Florentine meal. For me, the Steak Florentine was a bit too savory and rich and needed a bit of sweetness, but it was the perfect accompaniment to my light and fluffy Lemon & Ricotta pancakes. In addition to the food, I tried the Chocolate Chai. Even though it was 90 degrees outside, the beverage hit the spot.  In summary: DiAnoia's = Amazing DiAnoia's is an incredible Italian restaurant that feels straight out of Italy. DiAnoia's offers both flavorful brunch and dinner and many must-try dishes.  I can't wait to come back!",

It was still tasty, but I'm pregnant and the strong alcohol taste made me uncomfortable, so I split it with my husband.  But on to everything else, my husband brought me here for my 30th birthday dinner. We had reservations and were seated right away. It was pretty empty when we got there at 6 p.m. but it was full when we left. We really loved the minimalist style of the restaurant as it reminded us of the restaurants we ate at on the Amalfi coast. It looks like it could have been plucked right out of Italy. Our waitress was extremely attentive and when I asked if they could make me a mocktail at the bar, she knew the right questions to ask and got me something I really enjoyed. It was a mix of lemon and vanilla and I'll definitely be requesting it in the future.  We ordered the bread and olive oil as an appetizer and I got a salad with oregano dressing to eat before dinner as well. The bread was simple but amazing. They clearly know what they are doing. It had fresh parmesan sprinkled on top and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The salad was also delicious. Fresh, and the dressing was unique and tangy.   For our meals, my husband ordered the gnocchi and meatballs and I got the impossible lasagna. We were both extremely pleased. The lasagna had both red sauce and pesto, which I have never thought to put together, and it was incredibly tasty. When I make lasagna, I include a ton of cheese. This was much lighter on cheese than what I normally prefer, but I didn't even care.   As mentioned above, we had the tiramisu for dessert. Again, it was good, just a little bit too boozy.   We will definitely be back!",

This is a True Pittsburgh staple and a must stop for everyone to enjoy! They have such a creative menu like no place else and everything is freshly prepared and tastes like grandmas best recipe! If pizza isn't your thing I'd recommend the wedding soup! Again, it tastes like grandmas fresh batch with all the best ingredients! Definitely worth spending some time here again and again!",

    "text": "I finally came here after being recommended to try it for a third time by friends and co-workers and am so glad I did!  It's definitely a good idea to make a reservation first on opentable because the restaurant can be packed at certain times.  The service was great, our waitress had really good recommendations, was very knowledgeable, and came back multiple times to check up on how we were doing.  Apparently their menu changes every couple of weeks so there's always new variety to their dishes also a few popular ones never change. We had gotten the polpo fritta (fried octopus) as an appetizer which was a bit too salty but still very delicious. For entrees I got the cacio e Pepe and added blue crab to it. The portion was pretty big and I think it was a good idea to add protein to it. My wife had gotten the cappelletti primavera and I thought it was even better than mine. You cannot go wrong with the gnocchi either, which had very tender potato dumplings and flavorful meatballs.  The only negative factor was the noise level. It sounded almost like a high school cafeteria inside but I'm not sure there's much that can be done about that. (Maybe decrease the volume on the background jazz music so that guests aren't yelling to hear each other) Otherwise all in all I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be coming back for more.",

We were a little hesitant because it was so late, but we all agreed it was well worth the wait!   Tips: Make sure you get the bread with the ricotta.  The bread is thin with bubbles, some parts are nice and crisp. They have just the right about of oil and sprinkled cheese on it, and dipped in the whipped ricotta it's amazing.   We loved the meatballs - I'm picky too (I have 2 100% Italian Grandma's so I know my meatballs). Make sure you try some with the bread too..   Beans and greens were also a hit. They came out kind of soupy so I was hesitant, but the flavoring was perfect. The sausage def made it.   I had the pasta in lemon cream sauce shrimp and scallops.....mouth water. Portion sizes are huge, you'll definitely take the rest home for another meal or 2. Also got to taste my friends gnocchi in the bread bowl which was also sooo good.  We tried some of the cookies from their little bakery. Fav was the snickerdoodle between some Nutella.   We all agreed that we love this place and can't wait to come back. I heard their brunch and lunch are good too.   Only thing we didn't like is that it gets so noisy! It was hard to hear each other. The place was packed. This got better as people were leaving because we were there so late.",

The bread is hard to describe, other than it's a large puffball.   My ravioli was definitely house-made and delicious. The gnocchi was fluffy and tasty.   Our server helped us navigate the menu and gave many helpful vegetarian suggestions.   While so many places are too dark to even read a menu, DiAnoia's is bright, clean and cheerful.   There's a deli on one side, and a caffe counter.   The wine list could include some more reasonably priced bottles, they appear to be marking up their wine 100%.   I'm not sure why they don't buy a $14 bottle of Chianti and offer it for $22. For example, their Rosato Librandi, Calabria 2016 sells for $12.99 in the State Store, but they mark it up to $45.",

We also ordered cocktails which were pretty strong and definitely worth the price. The entrees definitely were the stars of the show: Gnocchi with Meatballs, Red Sauce, and Pecorino Romano and Branzinio All'Amatriciana (Rigatoni). DiAnoia's makes all of their pasta fresh, so I would highly recommend choosing one of those dishes. Only (minor) complaint is that we sat on the bar side and it was extremely hot that evening. Overall, awesome Italian!",

I'm not even much of a sandwich person but everything tasted so fresh and delicious i loved it.   DRINK: The bloody Mary was clearly made from a homemade mix as you could taste the tomatoe puree, so gains automatic points with me. It was as legitimate as you could get.  AMBIANCE: Went during lunch and I guess they don't provide service at that time? So we ordered from the counter, and when it's ready they bring the food out and call your name and deliver it to your table. Cute bar area and expensive artwork decorating the inside.

They were super accommodating and sat us at two open seats at the bar next to two diners who were wrapping up. Once those two seats opened up, we were able to sit and order! All told, we only waited about 15 minutes.   For food, one friend ordered the veal Parmesan, I got the European breakfast, and the last two (one vegetarian and one who doesn't eat pork) went for the egg sandwich. Their brunch menu that day appeared to have limited meatless options other than the egg sandwich and a french toast, and the meat options were mainly pork based, unless one wanted to opt for the veal or a fancy steak. Two of us ordered drinks: a Calabrian mocha (mocha w/ chilis) and an espresso.  The drinks came out first: the mocha was very good! Sweet & a bit spiced, but with a rich chocolate flavor. The espresso unfortunately was very sour and difficult to drink.  The food then came out without much wait. The European breakfast was a lovely platter of cheese, meats, fruit, and a small cornetti. There was a bleu cheese, provolone, and a third cheese that resembled Swiss, although I never confirmed. It was all very tasty! My friend enjoyed his veal parmesean as well, however the two who'd gotten the egg sandwich remarked that it seemed to be mostly bread (although the bread itself was very good).   Our brunch was overall good but definitely had some hiccups. Based on other reviews, it seems we'd have to come back for dinner sometime to get a complete DiAnoia's experience!",

Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich (4/5): this was good compared to everything else we had.  Tuna Sandwich: (3/5): average.  Spaghetti and Meatballs (3/5): pretty basic, noodles were cooked al dente which was nice.  Iced Chai Latte (2/5): could barely taste the chai.

The eatery is situated near the Strip District, but far enough that finding parking is not too much of a hassle. Walking in, you instantly notice the charming and unique decor. We grabbed seats at the bar since the place was extremely busy and was able to watch the orchestrated kitchen just off the side of the bar.   After looking through the menu I decided on the Veal Parmesan and no brunch is complete without a Mocha Vanilla Latte. The barista made the latte in front of me and went the extra mile in creating the beautiful steamed milk art you can see in the pictures. The latte itself also had a surprising spice and complimented the full body flavor. The veal came shortly after. Upon first glance, I was a little disappointed with the scarce amount of mozzarella. That disappointment melted away as I took a bite of the veal. It was beyond tender and juicy. The pasta itself did not stand out, but that might be because the veal was that good.   Unfortunately, for me the experience was mixed. The price tag seemed a little steep especially considering how average the pasta was. Though the veal and latte were pretty fantastic. The ambiance and service brings the rating up, so I will definitely not mind coming back to try some of their other offerings.",

Hide the bread basket, that stuff is addicting. The bar needs more staff. They are busy serving bar eaters, we waiting customers are kind of a second thought. Not a criticism more an observation. My husband gave up after the first wait. Went back up a second time and got served.",

We move frequently for work and have lived in Hawaii, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Georgia. I have not found a place that compares to DiAnoia's. The food is beyond compare and the subtle changes to the menu throughout the year make coming back again and again too easy. My wife and I have eaten here pretty much once a month since we discovered the place and have never been disappointed. The chef/owner Dave and I met when he was first setting the place up, he was giving away the old furniture that the previous owners left behind, he and his friends helped load some heavy furniture in the back of my truck and told me to come back and eat some delicious, made from scratch food. They were not kidding, the food is phenomenal and deserves to be talked about. Also, the serving staff is always on it, especially our regular server Nicki! Also, this is my first and probably only yelp review, so that should say something. Enjoy and bring a friend!",

    "text": "Having eaten all over Pittsburgh, I'm thrilled with this relative newbie and find it to be among the best Italian options in our city. It's got a little of everything - besides being a full service restaurant,it also serves breakfast, has a small bar and offers elements of a deli and bottle shot (added bonus is that restaurant guests can visit the coolers and pick out their own beer from a nice selection).The decor is fun, comfortable and anything but stuffy. My only complaint is that it's way too bright.They need to change up the lighting and use the dimmer switch when it's time for the dinner crowd to arrive. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable,but each visit has had its hiccups, once including the server getting orders for four of the five guests, but forgetting mine. Fortunately, the food completely rocks, pushing my overall rating to five stars, overlooking the flaws in service and atmosphere. The crudo appetizer is spectacular. The pasta entrees are delectable. While they tend to be a bit on the rich and heavy side, they're nonetheless perfectly cooked and with top notch ingredients that work well together. The linguine with mussels and garlic is an awesome new spin on the old school linguine with clam sauce. The Tagliatelle with charred radicchio, caramelized shallots, Gorgonzola,fennel, spinach, toasted walnuts and pesto is one of the richer vegetarian pasta dishes that you're likely to try. The restaurant has a bread appetizer on the menu, but if you don't order it,they'll bring you some delicious bread with dipping oil (I can only imagine how good the menu item is, but an up-charge bread menu item in an Italian restaurant just doesn't \"fit.\"). Save room for dessert. They make them in-house and they're darn good. The Ricotta tart is a great option if you prefer a dessert on the more savory side. There's a decent wine list,including lots of by-the-glass options as well. Now if they could just dim the lights and iron some wrinkles to make the service as flawless as it is friendly!",

Its perfectly salty and creamy and crunchy and if I could eat it every single day, I would.  For the main course, I got the gnocchi, which are legit the size of my fist.  Like I could take one home and use it as a pillow in my bed.  They are huge and puffy and fluffy and everything you could ever want in a potato pasta.  There wasn't too much sauce either, which I liked.  My boyfriend got the mussels and loved them.  We finished it all off with tiramisu which was, again, perfect.  Not too sweet and perfectly moist.  I cannot wait to go back for brunch and pizza.",

I will first say, our server was extremely slow with everything, took about 30 minutes to receive our cocktail order once he arrived to the table. We ordered the meat and cheese plate to start, very good and a lot for two people to indulge. Our food came out shortly after, gnocchi, extra order of meatballs, and the squid ink pasta.  Everything was very delicious.  Our server never came to see how our food tasted, my husband and I sat with empty cocktail glasses our entire dinner (would have ordered 3+ more drinks if the server would have been around) we sat with our appetizer and plates of food for over 40 minutes until he came back to see if we wanted anything else.  The restaurant was not that busy for a Friday evening, I am not sure why we were forgotten about. Food I will give an A. Server doesn't deserve anything more than a D, at best.  Disappointed and was hoping for a better dining experience. OH and when we went to eat our left overs the next day... the two boxes of food wasn't our orders!!",

My husband and I both ordered a glass of wine and the selections were well-priced and quite good. I enjoyed my burrata appetizer, but it was a little heavy and the bread with which it was served was too thick. My son's brodo with tortellini had good homemade pasta and I enjoyed the sip of broth I sampled. My husband's crudo was nice. The fresh bread served with the meal was also delicious. Our entrees were uneven. My son had the wild boar ragu which he scarfed up quickly. My tagliatelle primavera began with a nice combination of flavors, but after a while it was just too much to eat and the flavors began to feel muddled.  My husbands risotto was horrible -- soupy, bland, and not enjoyable at all. The manager comped us on the risotto, which was kind, but I don't think it should have been served at all -- it was that bad. We are not at all picky eaters, but there was just something a little off about this place. We will, however, return to give it another try.  The service was absolutely flawless and it is clear this is a restaurant that tries hard to please its customers. A little tinkering with some of the menu items and I think it will become a great dining option.",

I noticed that other servers did not seem to behave in this fashion so maybe it was just the inexperience or impatience of our waiter.

I talked about this meal to every single person that I encountered for the next few days. One of my coworkers told me I was being \"Di-Annoying\"! Haha.  I've seen some other reviews complaining about how close the tables are and that it's loud. If that is enough to bother you and ruin your meal, maybe this isn't the place for you. I would highly suggest you try to ignore it and be happy the number of tables squeezed in has allowed you a spot to eat here! I'm used to this set-up from eating at a lot of traditional Italian places in Philly, so I was not bothered one bit.   Great service from the beginning to the end! Our hostess, Esther, was very welcoming and got us seated right away. Our server, Nicki took great care of us the entire time. She was very friendly and extremely attentive throughout our meal! We went with the 3-Quarter Liter of the house wine which was perfect for the three of us to each to have a few small glasses.  Whatever you do, make sure you order the Brussel sprouts. It was one of the most delicious flavors I've tasted in a long time. I still think about them regularly... slightly charred, with a little crunch, covered in a creamy white cheese sauce. It was unreal. So flavorful, I would have sworn there was meat in it, but it was vegetarian! We also shared the Cauliflower, Ricotta, Pesto & Pine Nut dish which was also wonderful as a starter.  I kept it simple with the Cacio e Pepe with crab meat added. It. Was. Incredible. A simple dish that I wanted to keep eating forever. I still think about it a few weeks later. My fiance went with the Gnocchi while his father had the Beef Cheek Ravioli. Both were decadent and so delicious! Definitely come hungry and be ready to be in a major food coma after! I'm getting ready to make another reservation to go back!",

    "text": "The atmosphere at DiAnoia's is incredible. It's very reminiscent of an Italian bistro without feeling forced the way many do. It's a little loud, but not overwhelmingly so.  The wine list was well curated with enough tough-to-find options to make it unique. The pasta was rich but that's why you come somewhere like this, isn't it? I highly recommend the Cacio e Pepe and the homemade bread.  The service was friendly and efficient but never hurried.  All in all, it's a great place for a special occasion with tasty, satisfying food.",

    "text": "This is a new personal favorite dining experience. They have an authentic central and southern Italian menu, excellent baked goods including bread and pastries made the same day, excellent hand made fresh pasta made the same day, and a very robust supporting cast of antipasti, contorni, and meat dishes. You will get full on great tasting food. You will have a great time. You will want to come back.  I need to say this up front: primetime reservations are essentially required at this point. This restaurant has really taken off since it began last year and has become quite the well-deserved popular dinner spot. Weekdays are a little easier which is when I've been able to go, but I have never been able to go without needing several weeks advance reservation on a Friday Saturday or Sunday. It is worth booking in advance because this is an excellent dinner spot.  My personal favorites so far have been the appetizer shareable bread, burrata with orzo salad, and their fresh pastas. They do some very classic authentic Italian fresh pasta dishes including linguini al limone, cacio e pepe, spaghetti with meatball that have all been very generous servings, well seasoned and using good ingredients, to become an overall succulent delicious dish. The pasta has always been cooked perfectly, has a good texture and consistency, and full flavor. These pasta chefs know what they are doing, and I am a stickler for well cooked pasta.  I haven't yet been able to have room to eat a meat dish, but the offerings look quite appetizing when seen from a table over.  The ambience is very cute and very Mediterranean inspired. It can be a bit noisy when full, especially given the bar seating and large groups or communal seating that is available. It helps add to the bustling Italian atmosphere in my opinion, but other diners may not appreciate or want this.   Service has always been prompt and excellent and helpful. I have always found the Restaurant very clean, looking chic, as well as having very clean bathrooms.",

A couple of weeks ago on a Tuesday evening we were trying to decide what was for dinner - close to Lawrenceville and new to all of us.  DiAnoias it was!  The 3 of us were excited to try all the fantastic things we had heard about.  We got a couple apps to share.  The whipped ricotta was amazing - they only gave us a few pieces of bread, and with how much of that amazing ricotta there is - even if you put a TON on the bread - you still need more.  Our waiter graciously gave us a bit more when we got it packaged up to go.  Everyone also enjoyed the olives.  Our entrees were phenomenal.  We have already spoken of going back - as soon as possible - we just have to get our schedules to coordinate.  We can't wait to head back to try the pizza!",

The gnocchi was so tender and delicious, we also ordered the bread with whipped ricotta (so worth the $4!). We had dropped off a cake earlier and they brought it out and served it to us, really playing into the birthday vibe. Overall we had a great experience, our two servers were great (one was a slight bit cocky at times, it was nice we had someone who was a long time staff member though). I know we will be returning next year for her birthday!",

I don't even know their names but wow, they were both on point non stop hustle and everything they made was delicious. The girl making all the cocktails deserves an award as does the young man running the espresso/cappuccino machine, this restaurant is incredibly lucky to have such excellent staff.

    "text": "So I'm conflicted about DiAnoia's. I want to like it. It's an interesting concept. First off, make reservations. We arrived at 6:45 for our 7pm reservation and was seated fairly promptly. Our table was right in the middle of the restaurant. For a Thursday evening, they were very full already. It is very, very noisy. Be prepared to speak a little louder than usual. Also be prepared to be patient. It took our waitress about 10-15 minutes to make her way to our table.   She explained the menu and basics of how to order and a few of her favorite dishes. She did ask us if I was familiar with the internet because their gnocchi is well-known. Just an oddly phrased statement from the waitress.   I took her suggestion with the tagliatelle and my husband came for the meatballs and gnocchi. We also ordered the bread and olive oil with Romano as an appetizer. Save yourself the $8 on the bread. It's pizza dough. There's not much too it including flavor. We didn't order any alcohol because the prices were quite steep.   Close to 45 minutes later, the food arrived. It's all hand-made and anticipate the wait for the food. The lamb tagliatelle is something that you want to have a big bowl of on a cold winter's night. It has deep rich spices blended in with the lamb and the sauce. There's lots of rosemary, cinnamon, and all-spice that really develops the flavor of the dish. The gnocchi are very soft and pillowy in a delicious garlicky marinara. But....the meatballs had a lot of fennel in them. They needed more basic seasoning and a lot less fennel.   The meal portions are fairly appropriate to the style and cost. We also ordered some cookies and coffee for desert. Coffee was delicious. The cookies resembled the consistency of a wooden shim or a doorstop. They were burnt on the bottom, dry, and hard. Truly a let down.   Bottom line....it was okay. I wasn't over the moon. Nothing stood out or caused me to have a life-changing dinner moment. The waitress mostly left us alone. Parts of the meal were hit and miss. It's a welcome addition to the Strip District. Did I enjoy it? I guess. Do I need/want to go back? Probably not.",

A new and vibrant eatery along Penn Ave. They have a nice bar area as well as a decent sized seating area. Their brunch menu had plenty of options that I was eager to try. I ended up ordering a mocha and the prosciutto eggs benedict. My friend ordered the french toast.   The mocha was smooth and well-made. The eggs benedict was delicious. Every layer was perfect from the crunchy english muffin, salty prosciutto, and creamy spinach to the poached egg with hollandaise sauce.The hollandaise sauce was creamy but not too thick just the perfect consistency. My only complaint was the egg should have been a bit more runnier. The side of potatoes also were great, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My friend's french toast was made using panettone bread so she said it was unique but could have used a little more fruit or toppings. Overall, a nice addition to the Strip District. I would love to come back to try lunch or dinner here.",

The service was great - despite us arriving closer to closing time than we would like. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive. The food was also tasty and I wished that we could've tried more! We got mimosas, the personal pizza, the eggs benedict, and the stuffed cornetti. The pizza was fantastic, as well as what I had of the eggs benedict. That day's pizza consisted of mozzarella, tomatoes, peaches, some cured meat that I don't quite remember, red onions, and topped with an egg. I was disappointed by the cornetti, however. Perhaps it was because it was made earlier that day but the pastry was not buttery and flaky as I would have liked.   Overall, this was one of the best brunch experiences I have had in a while.",

We ended up waiting for an hour and a half on a Saturday since we didn't have reservation before we were finally sat at the bar, but the food makes it all worth it.  We decided to start with the Fresh Bread and the Prosciutto & Melon.  The Fresh Bread is essentially baked pizza dough then drizzled with olive oil and Parmigiano Reggiano.  You could add fresh ricotta but we decided to eat it as is because it already sounded pretty amazing, and it was. The bartender actually just got us a free helping of the ricotta and with the 1st bite, we knew why people get it.  Ricotta was super silky and yea, totally worth the $4 add on.  Prosciutto & Melon was very interesting since it had this pepper & red onion relish.  Didn't eat much of the relish since the prosciutto and melon were good on its own.  For pastas, we got two to share and went with a special of the day, which was this Oyster Mushroom Cacio e Pepe and the recommended Heirloom Tomato Tripoline. First off, pastas portions are pretty big.  Both pastas exceeded our expectations, especially the latter.  The cacio e pepe was very good and the oyster mushroom is a nice touch, but the tripoline was definitely the star of thee meal. Apparently it's only available during tomato season so if it is available, definitely go for it.   We ended the night with some classic zeppoles.  Can't go wrong with that!  Overall great meal - had a great time sitting at the bar.  Definitely try to get reservations if you can, even it is early or late.",

I had heard of them because of the \"gnocchi in a bread bowl\" thing and was not sure if this was going to be a gimmicky one-hit-wonder for tourists or a legit restaurant.  The menu was actually really interesting and I had a hard time deciding what to eat because everything looked so good (squash blossom ravioli? crispy chicken leg with mushrooms and pasta?). Ended up getting an appetizer that was a salad of peaches, saffron marscapone, fennel, and dill, the gnocchi + breadbowl (had to try it), and a side of chanterelles (which were somehow only $8??). There was also a special chanterelle carbonara that was very tempting.  As soon as I got my appetizer any concern that this was just a gimmicky restaurant was completely gone. It was incredible! I would never have put those flavors together myself and it was extremely well done. The gnocchi + breadbowl was also delicious but incredibly heavy -- would split with someone next time (though it heated up very well in my oven the next day). Chanterelles were excellent and confirmed that this is a restaurant that knows their stuff.  I visited with a friend, and halfway through our meal we were plotting monthly trips to try the entire menu. This might be my new favorite restaurant in PGH. Next time I'm planning to try another interesting appetizer and their version of my favorite pasta dish (pasta alla norma), now that I know they won't mess it up! (only negative = very loud! also, definitely get reservations)",

I did think the wine list was a little pricey. Not many bottles (especially red) in the low $40s range. We were celebrating my husbands birthday so we did get a bottle but I think a glass might be the way to go next time.   For an appetizer we had the heirloom tomato salad and it was amazing! The tomatoes were so fresh and the cheese was like a mix of burrata and ricotta. Yum!   If you go there and the gnocchi bread bowl is on the menu: you must get it! It was so aggressive but so so so good. It's like pasta and pizza all in one.  The sauce was good and it was super cheesy. We also had one of the pasta specials which had rabbit and a lemon sauce. This was also really tasty!",

    "text": "To sum up the review, I think it is over rated.  I think everyone in Pittsburgh has heard good things about DiAnoia's. Many of my friends are die hard fans. So I was really excited to try this out. I made reservations a month ahead because I know how hard to get in. So me and my husband came in for dinner to celebrate his birthday. We got some bread, clam back and gnocchi with meatballs. The clam bake and bread were super good. You can taste the freshness. 5 star for these two. But my disappointment comes from the gnocchi and meatballs even that is what they are known for I think. The gnocchi were very soft and meatball was lack of flavor. The sauce was mediocre. Nothing special, I guess just house made and fresh ingredients?   Anyway, I wouldn't think this is the best Italian restaurant in town base on what I had. Maybe the other things would be better? I think I will give it another try for some other items on the menu. But it didn't reach my expectations.",

Mascarpone flavored with saffron provided a savory complement to the fresh peaches and fennel, topped by fresh dill. There were two pasta dishes offered - cacao e pepe, which my husband ordered, adding shrimp, and pasta alla Norma, which was my choice. Both dishes were wonderful, and the housemade pasta was the star of each. Dessert on this special menu was tiramisu, and it was classic and rich.   Not only will I return, but already plan to bring guests here when they come to town. Great food!",

The bread with olive and cheese was delicious but not worth $8 in my opinion. I would probably not get it in the future. I recommend the clam bake, the flavor was really on point. I would wish they used bigger clams though to get the full seafood effect. The drinks were well made and reasonably priced.   Recommend the alla norma and the cavatelli di pollo. The taste for the all norma is more bland than expected, would have appreciated more of a kick in the sauce. The cavatelli had a great contrast in the lemony taste and the crispy chicken leg. I was sad they ran out of the carbonara, it looked delicious.  I would definitely come back to this place! I look forward to their other dishes as well. Great outdoor seating in the summer. The place was surprisingly big so not too bad of a wait!",

Bread was good, but we weren't fans of the ricotta. And because we all have recently come to love gnocchi, all three of us ordered the gnocchi. We didn't get the style in the bread bowl and are sooooo sorry that we didn't. Looking at what it looked like, we made a big mistake. But the normal gnocchi and meatballs were amazing enough and we left extremely carb-loaded, but feeling satisfied.",

For a place that serves some of the best Italian you can find, the atmosphere was just a little off I felt.  It was bright and kind of felt like a cafeteria.  However, the food they serve more than makes up for this.  For an appetizer my wife and I ordered the fresh bread with olive oil.  I have never seen a larger piece of bread as a side dish/appetizer.  It was huge, fluffy, and tasted incredible.  I wanted to stop eating it so I had room for my meal, but between the two of us we finished the whole thing.  For my main course I had the Bucatini Carbonara.  I am not even completely sure what was in this because I went off of our servers recommendation, but it was delicious.  The pasta tasted so fresh.  You can really tell it is homemade.  The sauce and bacon on the pasta all came together perfectly for one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  My wife had the gnocchi bread bowl which seems to be their signature dish.  I had a few bites and this was outstanding as well.",

We had drinks and bar snacks as the bar was open before the dining room and the snacks were great and reasonably priced ($4). When we were closed our tab to go into the restaurant the host told us we didn't have a table anymore but we could keep our bar seat which we gave up to get into the dining room. We were then told we could be seated but we were on a one hour and fifteen minute timer. It was reasonable as food came out quick but everything was rushed which is a shame since the dinner was great.   We ordered olives and the meatballs and sauce for appetizers. The olives were great (black ones were very salty) and the meatballs were superb. They were served in a total of 3 and were great to snack on. We did not get the bread and olive oil as we didn't want to overdo it since we had big pasta meals coming. The gnocchi and meatballs were incredible. I got to enjoy two more of the meatballs and the gnocchi were softer than my pillow at home. I would highly recommend, but looking at everyone's meal, it doesn't look like you can go wrong. The truffled pasta special was incredibly flavorful and cooked in a light creamy sauce. I split the tiramisu for desert and it was one of the best I've ever had.   I would absolutely go back and try everything but I wouldn't go through the hassle without a reservation.",

From the hostess's response, she seemed like she had several reservations in place, but we got lucky enough to just get sat at a high top table by the door, which was fine for us! Service was great, attentive, and quick the entire time!  They start you off with some bread in olive oil and vinegar, which all tasted fresh and flavorful. Our food came out surprisingly fast too. I ordered the cacio e pepe. It was spaghetti in a light cheesy sauce with black pepper, and it was delicious! My mom ordered the house salad and meatballs. She shared her meatballs with me, and they were tasty too, but one of them was a bit burnt. I think they thought covering it in sauce and cheese would hide that.   Now for my favorite part: the tiramisu...Definitely get some tiramisu if you stop here, wow it was fabulous. I don't even like tiramisu, but I saw it in the glass section of the cafe baked goods in the back, and I knew it would be a winner. Boy was I right. Even my mom loved it, and she is pretty picky.   My mom was actually craving a salad, so when I was looking at the yelp reviews, I saw a salad or two on the menu and in a few reviews, so that's why I suggested we stop here. The house salad was the only one on the menu today, so that was a little disappointing. I guess just be aware that the menu may switch up sometimes, and the items that have been reviewed on yelp might not still be there. Overall, great experience though.",

I really like the interior of the restaurant and the staffs are pretty attentive.  The food is okay. We ordered breakfast pizza, honey avocado toast and Zeppole. All 3 things we ordered were oily. The pizza was not warm. It seems like it was out of the oven for long time and left outside without any food warmer. I asked them to heat it up and the pizza became soggy. The avocado toast was pretty good. The Zeppole was just meh.   I would go back again to try other foods for dinner",

    "text": "We wanted to like it! We really did. But I'm sorry to say for my wife and I it just didn't live up to the hype. First impression walking up to the place was the noise level -LOUD. Very loud. On a comfortable July evening the roll up garage doors were open and people were enjoying dinner outside, but the sound from inside had to escape somehow. Inside it was so hard to hear the greeter or server, so just smile and nod. If you're looking for a romantic dinner date, forget it- look elsewhere unless she enjoys you screaming sweet nothings in her ear.  Onto the food. The best thing I can say about it was that everything tasted very fresh. Very Bland, but fresh. To start out I ordered the greens and beans with sausage. The flavor was good but the greens were sparse- mostly beans. And the sausage was crumbles. Still, not bad. I ordered the \"garlic bread\" on a recommendation from a friend who's been here before (5x in fact), saying it was not to be missed. Well, the $8 price be damned, I ordered it. It arrived looking like a huge puffed pastry, which gave me hope that this might be an interesting twist on an old idea. It had a nice dusting of grated cheese on top, and a bit of olive oil on the sides. Well, it was just ok, but a bit tough and somewhat tasteless to my palate. If you're hell bent on ordering this, know that it's probably enough to feed 4. Which wouldn't feel so expensive if you think of it as $2/pp. but then recall most Italian restaurants give you bread for free.  I ordered the Agnelle suge pappardelle pasta with  lamb for my main. The pasta was fresh and cooked properly. But the lamb was shredded and sparsely spread on top. The sauce was rather tasteless and even red pepper flakes didn't do much for it.  Oh, did I mention the $12 glass of wine? A modest pour, to boot.  My wife decided to try the zepoles for dessert and a glass of lemon cello. The Zepoles were heavy and undercooked. The lemon cello was just ok.  All in all, a very disappointing dinner. Especially for the price. Don't get me wrong, I never complain about paying too much for a great meal, but for a mediocre meal I bitch a little.  As always I like to end a review by recommendation. In this case I would not recommend and would be unlikely to return. There are much better Italian restaurants in da burgh for same or less money.",

    "text": "My wife and I met friends here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. My wife has heard several good things about this place prior to us coming here. Being very close to one of the churches we go to occasionally it was easy to make an excuse to head down to try this place out.   Like most places in the strip there was no parking but being further down it was fairly easy to find on street parking a block away. Upon arriving I used the restroom which is only one person per gender at a time so you can potentially have a small wait. The inside looked very hipster, maybe more from the patrons than the decor. I was told this place was an old bridal shop which I could see from the layout. Regardless the inside fits in nicely with the rest of the strip district.   For brunch my wife and I had the breakfast pizza and the veggie scramble. The pizza came with chick peas, pesto, onion, and some kind of slow roasted pork belly with a fried egg on top. The pizza was excellent! It had some really good savory flavor and could have been split between two people. The veggie scramble was decent and included potatoes. The potatoes were sub par being partially burnt on the bottom for most of them.   Overall a very good brunch! The pizza is a unique flavor and I'm curious for what other creations they have. Will want to come back after church sometime.",

The atmosphere is so cute, with the bottle and wine glass chandeliers. The service is great. They understand their drink and food menu, and are able to give good recommendations according to your liking.  I had the Agnello Sugo, which is a pappardelle pasta, braised lamb, tomato, parmesean cheese with parsley leaves on top. This was to die for! I enjoyed every bit of it. And had to slow myself down because I need to watch my food intake(the portion size is nicely large) and I wanted to save some for the next day at home. Either, be greedy like me, or share with friends. I did nibble on a few items my friend ordered, and I enjoyed hers as well. Again, I had to try and refrain from eating it all. They have a pizza shop attached to the restaurant that I can't wait to try out. I will definitely be back to eat in the dining area and try out more food items, as well as, check out the pizza. Don't wait as long as I did to try it out!",

My friends and I reserved a table for Saturday night.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  The server soon arrived at our table with a serving of focaccia and a willingness to answer any questions.  Throughout the evening, he was ready with suggestions that made it clear that he had experience with the items and would help us to find what worked for our tastes.  I was able to make a meal out of two sides--meatballs and a cauliflower dish that had pine nuts and ricotta cheese.  These surpassed my expectations.  My friends raved about the gnocchi.  The evening was capped with dessert and coffee.    This is a restaurant that manages to combine a homey feel with sophistication.  I cannot wait to return.",

Asked for a coffee that was 1/2 decaff, half regular but they 'don't do decaff' so the coffee option was out.  Ordered a breakfast sammich, while waiting a number of staff walked by me, no one even made eye contact, not very friendly for just opening.  Took my sammich to go, had to head to the suburbs for work.  Took a bit while still parked and an uncooked yolk exploded inside my SUV.  Never had a breakfast sammich to go like that.  Promptly cleaned up  and ditched the food, headed to my usual spot down the street.  May try them again, but I'm  in no hurry.",

Also, the greens and beans were delicious - different than a lot of other Italian places, they were more beans than greens.  The porchetta was to die for!!!!!  The crudo was simple with just olive oil, lemon and branzino - so darn good!!!!!  We did opt for the premium wine pairings and they perfectly complemented our meals.

My husband finally asked about it and the bartender shrugged then asked the chef to make it for us. Came out immediately. Another 35 minutes went by and we watched as everybody else's entrees walked past us from the kitchen. Finally ours arrived, as the stoves were turned off and they were cleaning the kitchen. I don't quite understand why we were deemed with the lowest priority and received our entrees last but it made us uncomfortable to watch them all clean while we scarfed down our food. We even wanted to order dessert but felt like the kitchen was now closed and we weren't allowed to. The food was absolutely outstanding. Their pasta is made in house and you can absolutely tell. But, for the price and service, I won't be rushing back.",

Failed to tell us they were out of the ravioli until I tried to order it, so even fewer still pasta selections. My beer took about 15 minutes to show. Overpriced wine list. We had the least expensive bottle of red on the list. A table wine called Maiana Salice Salentino. It cost about $38 or $39. You see it online for about $13, retail. I get that most restaurants make their money off liquor sales, but a 300% markup is gouging in my book. The house salad was tasty and big enough for us to split. The meatballs were big and good with a tangy red sauce. The olive plate had a nice variety and a fair quantity. The gnocchi had a nice texture, light not doughy, and the porchetta plate fun, different, and plentiful.  The zeppoles for dessert were delish. I'd prefer, though, if they let the customer choose how much powdered sugar to apply versus coating them in it. I'd return, just not in a hurry to--it's not a relaxing place to eat, and hope in the meantime they'll moderate the wine $ markup across the board. Even the wine on tap isn't inexpensive.",

Try the branzino crudo.  Absolutely delicious.  The texture of the gnocchi was sublime.  The bread appetizer with a glass of red wine is amazing. But, there were a couple of misses.  The pasta that came with the clams was under seasoned.  The marinara that came with the gnocchi lacked any kind of umami.  It tasted like Pomi crushed tomatoes went straight to the plate.  And the cauliflower ricotta casserole had so much garlic it was difficult to stomach. I'll be back, knowing what I know, because I can put together a list of grand slam hits.  But, sadly, it is not yet a place where every dish is a safe bet.",

For lunch we order a Turkey sandwich with avocado and Italian bacon. It was fresh and delightful. We also ordered a meatball sandwich and pasta with meatballs for the kids. They cleaned their plates. I'm picky about meatballs and so are our kids and these were excellent homemade meatballs. We also ordered zeppoles for dessert, which are a classic Italian style doughnut and they were so good!

Lunch is fast casual kinda concept with giving them your name at the counter and they come out and yell your name to deliver your food, its quite the awkward setup and i hope they get a better service structure in the future. Fyi you get free water to pour yourself but they dont tell you until you already pay, nonetheless for a large bottle of water. The food was alright, my favorite was the meatballs. Got a sausage and peppers panini and it was not really good at all. Needed a creamy component to pull it together. My italiano panini was just ok, it was served cold and the only good thing really was the meat, would have liked better buns for the paninis. Wish i would have just ordered pizza. The cashier forgot to ring my latte after we had to call over the barista to ask if he could make it over ice and a big ordeal was made, and it wasnt realized they forgot it until the server said it wasnt on my tab and asked if i wanted her to reorder it. I told her forget it because we already had our food and i wanted to enjoy it before,  but the barista was nice and brought me one on the house which was really nice, some of the staff was nice, but  the server had an attitude, mostly when I simply reminded her that we had more to our order, her response,  \"i only have so many hands!\" So rude. Will try somewhere else next time.",

Our waiter brought the steak to the table for us to see if the cut was large enough before it was cooked. While it was tender and tasty I highly recommend the Porchetta as many placed in the burg serve good steaks. The Porchetta was sliced thin and piled on foccacia.  Rosemary flavor was dominate. There was no skimping on the vegetable on the Tagliatelle Primavera.  The cream puff dessert was the favorite at our table.  We have been there for lunch and enjoyed the meatball and sausage paninis too. We will definitely be returning.",

Super talented chef and equally nice man. Of course, the meal did not disappoint! We started with polpo (charred octopus), escarole/beans/sausage and tortellini for the table. Honestly, the only problem with this is the four of us all wanted to raise the serving bowls to drink in the broths from the escarole and tortellini dishes. Delicious!!! We then shared Branzino, spaghetti with bolognese sauce (special request) and Cinghiale. All were fantastic and this on their first night. The wine selection was more than adequate and it's especially nice you can get a half liter. The service was a little confused, as expected, but very attentive.",

Legit burrata, crudo, hand turned pasta. Such a treat! I like the vibe...colorful and homey with pictures that can be found in every traditional Italian household. Reminds me of my long passed relatives. We had one kink in our meal progression where a few appetizers came out with our entrees leaving us to frantically eat everything so none would be cold. This was quickly remedied by the front of the house. She was extremely on point when I tried to tell her it wasn't a big deal saying \"no, this isn't the right way to do it.\" When you have accountable people in charge you know those things will smooth out over time. She brought us coffees and a platter of delicious dessert samplings that were not needed but much appreciated. DiAnoia's does not cut corners with ingredients or prep and put together some really exceptional authentic dishes!",

Selected another wine only to have server take the order then wait on 2 other tables as we sat for 20 more minutes without anything but water on our table, when finally bringing the second bottle ordered it was different vintage than on wine list and another apology. All awhile 4 other tables, some including our server, had sat after us, received drinks, appetizers and dinner. I don't understand how such a new restaurant would be out of the wine on the list, then serve a different vintage than what is on the list.

    "text": "Lucky enough to come here for my birthday tonight! I have been meaning to try this place for a seriously long time, even suffering guilt for not doing so sooner since I am italian and love to critique italian cuisine. Putting pizza aside, this has to be my new favorite italian place in Pittsburgh!  The decor was really not like any other italian restaurant I have ever been to. Usually the walls are covered with red or grapevines or something distinctly Italy inspired. The main colors here were blue and white! They had a variety of interesting art on the walls and chandeliers made of wine glasses and bottles. It was perfectly balanced between upscale and casual, pulling off both at the same time, which left me feeling comfortable but also feeling like I was having a fun night out.  We started with a few appetizers. One was a tray of mozzarella stuffed rolls served with marinara, then we had a giant flatbread covered with parmigiana and drizzled with olive oil (it was sooo perfect), and hungarian pickles (random but still really good). I was really impressed with the flavors and how they could have a dish covered in oil while simultaneously not being oily.   My dinner was a surprise dish and it incredible. It was a play off of the tagliatelle featured on the menu but without the cheese and with cauliflower and tomatoes and something that gave it a crunch (like a crouton). I was really impressed and happy they had fun options for vegetarians.   Dessert was the real test, though. My grandmother made the most perfect cannolis and I have never had one that compared. She used real ricotta, which very few people use (surprisingly). But I have to say, tonight's cannoli really impressed me. Filled with house made ricotta and little bits of pistachio and orange, it was a real treat and tasted authentic too.  I will definitely come back and love to try their brunch or lunch menu next!",

    "text": "Without a doubt my favorite restaurant in the city, favorite place to take friends and family, favorite date night spot, favorite EVERYTHING.  I may only be half Italian, but I love DiAnoia's with my whole heart.  Every meal I have had here (and there have been many) has been spectacular and service is on par with places at a much higher price point.    I almost always start off with the beans & greens (I believe they list it as escarole and sausage on the menu, but I call 'em like I see 'em)... soooo good!  The sausage is just spicy enough and the fresh bread they provide to the table is perfect for soaking up every last drop of the delicious broth.  I also really enjoy the crudo and whipped ricotta appetizers.  It's always so hard to choose, but I've never been disappointed with my decision.  They offer a side dish composed of cauliflower, pesto, and some other magical ingredients that is SO so good and can also double as an appetizer or even your meal!    Portions are wonderful and quite honestly their prices are a steal for what you get! I love following them on Instagram to stay up on the latest menu items and it's never long after one of their posts before I make my way here again.  By far one of the best Italian eateries I've ever dined in, and I've been to Italy!  Even my aunt remarked how much my grandfather, born and raised in Italy, would have loved this place, right down to its gorgeous decor that makes you feel like you're on a European vacation.    Mangia!",

Then we tried to make sure I sat in a seat that gave more room and a chair we thought that no one would cut thru behind.  Welllllll, I was only bumped into about 5 times by the staff and did anyone apologize??????   Noooooo!!!!!   Was the restaurant full.  No!  Could this table have been not seated?  Yes!!!!!!    The food is good.  But!  Service tends to be scattered.  Our waitress was nice and answered a few questions.  We ordered drinks and someone from the bar delivered but it took over 10 minutes.  Our appetizers was delivered by someone and they were good.  Then when our meal arrived, the plates were dropped in front of us and our empty appetizer plates not taken and now a very overcrowded table.  Also, no new forks for our meals, which is OK sometimes but not with the different type of meals we ordered.   The pasta I had was very good and cooked perfectly.   This  could be a good restaurant, if they got the service figured out and maybe remove one table. And yes it is noisy.",

It took a server about 15 minutes to first visit our table-- they must not have known we were seated. Once we had a server, he was fantastic 5/5!  My friend and I shared the Cacio E Pepe and Primavera (tagliatelle) for our entrees. The Cacio E Pepe was cold and dry and the tagliatelle was bitter and also pretty dry. Both were 2/5.   We had the bread pudding for dessert which was delicious! The portion was pretty small so we each got one.   I would come back to try the sandwiches and/or pizza, but not for the pasta.  Parking is available along Penn and the side streets near the restaurant. You might have to do a loop or two around the block, if the strip is crowded!",

The wine list is excellent, the space is beautiful, and the service is attentive and enthusiastic.  All of the pastas are made fresh in-house. My recommendation? Order an appetizer or two and a salad for the table; pair it with a pasta. Or, get a few sides and order one of the entrees. Don't overthink it--if it looks like you'll like it, you will. If it looks like you might not like it, order it anyway and invite me to dinner. Leave room for dessert...I certainly didn't, but I guess we all need something to bring us back again.  Since it's in the Strip, parking is pretty easy within a few blocks, but the space fills up, so you're best chance is to make a reservation or hope there's an opening at the bar. Or get it to go!",

In my personal opinion, it was pretty pricey/upscale.  I wasn't overwhelmed and don't feel the need to go back, but I definitely suggest trying it.  I had the Gnocchi and Meatballs and it tasted homemade.  There were eight members in my party and everyone enjoyed their meal.  It was difficult to pay at the end of the meal, however, because they wouldn't accept more than one credit card with a certain amount of people there.  I hope this changes at some point.  The restaurant was full, but the acoustics didn't make it feel overcrowded or loud.   I think the only thing to keep in mind is that they close at 9PM during the week, so planning a late dinner isn't the best idea or you'll be the only ones left in the restaurant.",

Def a delicious appetizer and a fan favorite. Almost every table surrounding us ordered it! We then shared the gnocchi meal. The gnocchi was cooked to perfection; it was delightfully airy and lightly splattered with a sweet tomato sauce. Two humongous meatballs also accompanied this meal. If we would have had time, I would have liked to have tried a dessert and a cappuccino or Italian coffee. The dessert menu looked great and the bakery displays enticed my tastebuds. :) Our server was friendly and attentive; she gave us some suggestions and seemed knowledgeable of JR changing menu items. All in all, it was a good experience. My only critique is the prices given the content and size of the dishes. I would conservatively expect to spend at least $30 per person at this venue, if not $50 pp. For me, dining at this location would be reserved for more of a special occasion instead of a general evening of grabbing dinner. However, I wouldn't be opposed to dropping in for a coffee or grabbing an Italian pastry as a snack. The prices were decent and the cafe menu looked scrumptious.",

    "text": "DiAnoias has the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life. I don't even typically like gnocchi that much, but their gnocchi is delicious. Little fluffy pillows of deliciousness. The *most* fluffy and light gnocchi I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The gnocchi I order is in a red and cream sauce and comes in a bread bowl. I have not asked about this in the past, but I wish I could order that type of gnocchi in a regular bowl and not pay an additional $10 for bread bowl. The bread bowl is good, but not always worth the calories.   Anyway, besides the gnocchi *Sorrentina style, everything else I've ordered or tried has also been delightful. I've been to DiAnoia's for brunch and for dinner about four times total and I have never been disappointed with any of the food they serve. Eggs in purgatory with a side of perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes made my day last month. Every dinner I've had at DiAnoia's has ended with tiramisu AND this pine nut cake thing that is perfectly sweet. I recommend ordering both if you can.  The only two complaints I've had with DiAnoia's is that twice I've made a reservation and then waited a bit longer than anticipated in an awkward waiting area where there wasn't room to sit and everywhere I stood I felt I was in someone's way. Although, they have been super flexible and easy going with moving tables when possible and were very sweet when we ran very late last night in the snow storm.  Second complaint relates to the only male server that I have seen working. He was slower and less responsive than the other female servers I've interacted with. He was my server for brunch and we had multiple awkward moments where my friend and I had to flag him down for whatever reason and then waited a long time for whatever we asked for. That day the espresso machine had broken down after I ordered the Dirty Maple Chai. They asked if I would be okay with it being made with coffee and I agreed, but was a little disappointed at the $7 charge on the bill for the dirty soy chai made with coffee.   DiAnoia's can also be loud because of the acoustics  in the dining room, but this has only bothered me on one occasion. I think the set up and vibe of the dining room makes this a great place for groups and celebratory dinners.   Even with the amount of time I focused on the negatives in my review, DiAnoia's is wonderful and probably on my top ten of places I enjoy eating in Pittsburgh.",

A hearty but smooth porridge made with a slight twist of welcomed acidity (lemon). The rich, stewed tomato sauce sat atop a creamy polenta and dresses a soft shredded, slow cooked pork that melts in your mouth. It's a done deal for me! All of these elements came together perfectly over a generous portion of fresh grilled bread. My only complaint is that I would've liked a bit more balance of stew tomato sauce. The ratio of polenta to tomato sauce was probably 3:1. I would've liked a bit more balance there.",

The place was packed when we got there, and stayed busy the whole time. The atmosphere is great! The restaurant itself is huge, and the dining room is lively yet feels homey.  We started off with an order of fresh baked bread, which was warm and delicious. For my entree, I had the spaghetti al limone, which was shrimp and caviar in a lemon cream sauce.The lemon  sauce had a great flavor without being overpowering, and there was tons of shrimp and caviar too. I do wish there was something in there such as herbs or a vegetable that brightened it up a bit, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I also got to sample some of the gnocchi and meatballs which were delicious (and I would probably order this next time instead).    My only complaint was that service was pretty slow the entire night. It took us a while to get our entrees and our bill. Understandably it was very busy, but I think they could have done a little better on that part. Still, our waitress was friendly and great at explaining the menu. I will be back for sure!",

I don't even know where to start... our waitress Jules was amazing - kept our drinks full all night AND a smile on our faces!!! We started off with the Apple Salad which was SO fresh and the dressing was like nothing I've ever tasted before!! Next we had the Crudo and the Caputo Brothers Whipped Ricotta and the Hot Peppers & Oil - they were all SO delicious I couldn't even tell you which was my favorite! We could've stopped there and it would've still been the most amazing meal we have ever had, but our entrees were next! I got the Gnocchi (served with the biggest meatballs I've ever seen!) and my sister got the Pumpkin Carbonara Rigatoni, which is a seasonal item on the menu. They were both PERFECT and we were so glad we had saved room to eat our entrees after all the food we had leading up to them! Make sure you try their draft wine too - I could've stayed there drinking it all night!! The owner Chef Dave was SO good to us, checking on us multiple times throughout the night which is almost unheard of in the restaurant industry any more!! We will definitely be returning to check out their famous brunch and lunch options in the very near future and suggest you do too!",

    "text": "I was super excited for an Italian restaurant with a pasticceria--one of my big gripes with PGH is the lack of Italian pastries. We headed here on a Friday night, foolishly without a reservation, and were able to snag a seat at a high top table near the entrance (our 7pm arrival would have netted us a 9pm seating in the main dining room). We ordered an assortment of dishes:  -Tortellini en brodo. We got this purely because of Yelp recommendations, and the broth was indeed delicious and deeply flavored. The tortellini themselves were a bit chewy, not in an \"al dente\" way, but in a \"this pasta is too thick\" way.  -Pork neck toast. The pork was nicely tender, but the red sauce accompanying it was overly sweet.  -Cauliflower with ricotta and pine nuts. This was a very large portion, but was a bit lackluster. The lightness of ricotta wasn't highlighted with the seasoning, and with only ricotta, the dish wasn't cheesy enough to be a gratin.  -Ravioli al'uovo. We're a bit biased since we make this at home (with sage brown butter), but we though the richness of the egg yolk was lost amid the creamy sauce. While the assorted mushrooms lent depth to the dish, one of the varieties remained significantly firmer than others and didn't meld with the dish.  -Cinnamon roll. This was topped with a really tasty, pleasantly sour frosting. Full marks on that part! The roll itself was fine, but wasn't served warm, so it was a little firm and definitely needed the heaping topping of frosting for moisture. But the real downside to me was the stunning lack of Italian pastries--while there are some Italian *desserts*, the pastries are pretty much all French! No pasticiotti, no sfogliatelle, and not even any cannoli! (As an aside, it is a travesty that most of the places in the Strip fill their cannoli with whipped cream...an even bigger affront than not having any.)  -Limoncello. This was a delicious housemade version with just the right amount of lemon...no medicinal quality whatsoever.  They currently have no happy hour specials, although our server hinted that might be in the works. I'll give it another shot for the sandwiches, as service was excellent and the place has great ambiance, but I repeat my plea for actual Italian pastries in PGH!",

Made on home made bread, who does that??? What a great idea. The veal parm with prosciutto was really good. The veal cutlet breading was like a home made cutlet, not what you typically get on a sandwich. Very good. The prosciutto sounds odd on a parm hero but gives the hero a nice saltiness.  We also had the pork with broccoli rabe and hot peppers. If you have ever made the trip to the famous Dinics Pork in Philly, this sandwich is just like that. Really, really good.  Now for the pizza. I am from NY and I have been to all the famous pizza places you hear about. Now Im the type that hasn't really come across a pizza I didn't like, but the pizza at DiAnoia's was good. Like really good. I could not believe that this NY style pizza came from an oven in Pittsburgh. The crust was super crispy, well done, with charring all around-just the way it should be!  Also, the service was great. It was well paced and we were not rushed at all. We had great real conversations with both very friendly bartenders. They both impressed us with some very nice mixed drinks. My favorite was the iced espresso Based drink I think it was called the Merda.",

I honestly scoff at pasta places...until i realized what good pasta was...last night.  Service left a lot to be desired, from being encouraged to pick out a beer from a 'beer wall' which was a cooler of beer to telling us the dessert menu is on the other side of wall if we wanted to see it.  Little things like that grated on what was otherwise a great experience.  It's a young place, still working out its kinks.  The setup was simple and adorned with unassuming art (that one can purchase...for $$$$).   As for price, it's on par with other well-crafted Pittsburgh eateries, maybe slightly on high side for some entrees.  Maybe we'll be back!  Food -5 Ambience-5 Service -2 Price -3",

    "text": "Just moved to the Strip District and could not stop hearing about this place.  We tried to go a couple of times for dinner but they are always busy and reservations are hard to come by. My husband and I also prefer to dine at the bar rather than get a table and the few times we walked by the bar was full. However, we dropped by on a Thursday afternoon as the lunch was ending and it was about 40 minutes until dinner service started, so we got a seat at the bar and had a couple of drinks before dinner started. The bartenders were very friendly and helpful with suggestions. We ordered the escarole-bean-sausage appetizer and the cauliflower side to start. OMG- They were incredible. So flavorful and warm and comforting! Then we shared the spaghetti with oil & pepper per the bartender's recommendation. It was also amazing, so simple but perfectly executed. It's the first time in awhile that I ate at an Italian restaurant and thought that it was like the authentic Italian food you get while in Italy.",

The seating is decent. It's not intimate yet not distracting. The main attraction here is a nationally famous dish of Penne in a bread bowl (which is good if you're a carb fan) but that's not the best thing they have to offer. I would recommend eating fresh made noodles that won't fill and bloat you, Brussel sprouts, and a cold beer to wash it all down. Worth a shot.",

It's something that you should be able to find in Bloomfield but can't. I've tried two pasta dishes (attached) and looking forward to returning for brunch soon! The gnocchi were amazing, the tomato sauce was fresh and delicious, and the pasta was made in house.  I would recommend checking their hours ahead of time because they're not opened all day everyday and closed for holidays. They're run like a smaller restaurant.   Additionally, the desserts looked AMAZING but I didn't get to try them. The pasta filled me right up!",

Three guests of my party, including me, ordered the tripoline. The only difference between our dishes was that I had added chicken to mine. When the plates came out, immediately you could tell they were completely different pastas. The color of the sauce in mine was red and thick compared to the light pink and runny sauce in theirs. Additionally, there was no basil in my dish when the description of the pasta specifically has basil in it. Everyone at the table tasted the two to compare and we all agreed they were different. I informed the waiter who proceeded to give me an excuse about the seasoning of the chicken being responsible for the different flavor profile -_- anyhow, she took it back to the kitchen and 10 min later, I received the same thing I had returned, with half of it thrown out with the chicken, and basil tossed in.  I was hungry and didn't see the point in correcting them again since it was moot the first time so I ate whatever was on my plate, but I was disappointed in the level of service to correct their mistake. The actual tripoline was delicious and I'm jealous I didn't get the real deal. If you order it, DONT ADD CHICKEN.",

Don't let the menu scare you... yes, many of the dishes' names are written in Italian - but, yes, you are eating at an Italian restaurant. ;)  It's makes it a nice experience in my opinion.  Plus, the description is in English and the staff was really helpful with making recommendations.  Cacio e Pepe translates to cheese and pepper - way less sexy in English.  It's a simple, traditional pasta dish and it's heavenly.  The only minor thing we didn't love was the noise - it was a little loud in the dining room, but that could have been an off night with loud patrons.  It didn't kill our conversation, but it wasn't soft and romantic.    Bottom line: attentive service, bright atmosphere, and great food - we'll be back.  :)",

My brunch bunch chose DiAnoia's for our monthly get together and we've been talking about it ever since. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which fed me all day long. Add in the zeppoles (donuts) and we were one happy bunch. In addition to the wonderful food, the staff at DiAnoia's make you feel right at home. If there isn't an Italian Nonna in the kitchen, color me surprised. Drop what you're doing, and go to DiAnoia's before you can't get a reservation!",

The general manager was deep in a conversation with another table for at least 15 minutes before she came over  and offered to cover the cost of our dinner. The owner was clearly present, tasting wines behind the register, and it looked like he was told about the incident, and did not come over to say anything.  This was shockingly one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I REALLY wanted to like this place too.

Everything was great! We had a selection of home made Italian cookies for dessert. Also we tried a liter of the red wine (like a pinot noir) on tap, which was new to us, and we found it to be quite good. Loved the atmosphere and the service was fantastic!!

No wonder they take reservations even for Sunday brunch. The lemon and ricotta pancakes were certainly the best pancakes I've eaten in a long time. My boyfriend ordered this dish which was basically a compressed-pie form of spaghetti, eggs and Parmesan which was fabulous! Highly recommended if you're super hungry coz it's heavy! The breakfast pizza looked amazing.. and actually so did most the dishes. We couldn't stop ogling at food on the tables around us while we waited for ours... which brings me to service. Now I don't know if it was an off day or  the fact that they were so busy, service really was a bit of a downer. We waited 15 mins for our drinks and despite that my boyfriend was served the wrong drink! He'd ordered an Irish coffee and he was served just regular coffee. My Bloody Mary (although really yummy) was missing the cheese it supposedly comes with. I was mildly miffed coz people who came after us had their food on their table way before us..while we still were waiting on drinks. They fixed my boyfriend's drink though..but charged us for the fix and we ended up paying $20 for an Irish coffee. I find it a bit annoying when an upscale busy restaurant doesn't put their customers first! Annyywho, I've ended up rating the place 4 stars though.. the food really is THAT good! Hopefully it was just an off day for service.",

Here is my issues: The woman who served us and also working the register was so incredibly rude to me. I was sitting at the bar and she was so off putting that I wished I had waited for a table. I have dealt with rudeness many times before (who hasn't!) but this was so unprofessional and ruined my time.

    "text": "Everyone rants and raves about DiAnoias, so I could not wait to finally eat here. We had a table of 9 for my friends birthday. Unfortunately, I was not impressed and I am so disappointed that I didn't love it. I can not figure out why they serve warm water? All of the water containers on our table were room temp. It was 84 outside & the restaurant garage doors were open. Someone please give me a glass of ice water! The restaurant was SO loud we could not even hear one another speak, let alone hear what our server was saying. I was looking forward to hearing the weekend specials, but 8:00 Friday night, they were completely out of specials?   To start, I got a house salad & it was really good but not worth the $9 price. For dinner, everyone at the table who got the gnocchi bread bowl loved it and I wish I would have gotten it. My husband had some kind of seafood pasta and enjoyed his meal, but it had hardly any meat. He was glad he added shrimp because without doing so, it would not have had much protein.  I got pappardelle pasta with homemade Italian sausage. I really wanted pasta with some kind of sausage, but there wasn't any on the menu. I asked the server and she they had sausage & that would be really good, so I got it. I should have known not to get something that wasn't on the menu. The noodles themselves were really good, but it came out with absolutely no sauce? Just a bowl of noodles and meat. I asked for red sauce and she brought me some but I didn't think the sauce was very good for being an Italian restaurant, it didn't have much flavor. I also didn't like that there wasn't any salt & pepper on the table. Then I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could find a server to ask for some Parmesan cheese since my pasta has absolutely none & I wasn't ordered any, which was disappointing.  To finish, we had some cookies and coffee, espresso & cappuccinos. My cappuccino was excellent but the lemon cookie I had was so dry and tasteless. Really needed a glass of milk to wash the dryness of the cookie down. After 1 bite, I was done.  Will I go back to DiAnoia's? Probably... I think I'll give it another try since others seemed to enjoy it but I don't think I'll be back with a large group due to the noise in the restaurant. I'd like to try it for lunch sometime.",

We ordered an array of pasta and italian-y dishes that were devoured by my table. The staff was polite and helpful. Yes the waits were long. Yes they were crowded. Yes it was a little loud. I have only been once and have been JONESING for it every since, like some wild pasta junkie. Do yourself and your stomach a favor and at least try it out because you pass it by. It's definitely living up to the hype and their instagram is the bees knees.  When I get more time I would like to go with just my SO and see how we feel in a smaller group. Things were clustered with so many of us there and it was hard to give it a fair shake.",

    "text": "I had heard so many good things and read so many good reviews about DiAnoia's so needless to say I was super excited to give it a try. The gnocchi bread bowl is crowd favorite here and very well known so of course I had to try it. It did not disappoint!! Omg the homemade gnocchi is out of this world. It melted in your mouth! The bread bowl was also amazing. I couldn't eat much of it cause wow holy carbs but I really enjoyed what I did eat. I also had a meatball on the side which I typically don't order out because I prefer my moms homemade ones but just like the gnocchi it was amazing. It's also byob which they didn't want to tell me when I called and asked. They first explained that they have a full bar and wine list then said the cork fee is $12 which in my opinion isn't terrible.I can't wait to go back and try the brunch. The pizza and sandwiches look so good.   Just a few more things about my overall experience here. The restaurant itself is cute and casual. I love the blue and white color scheme. Making a reservation was a bit difficult as when I called the restaurant was extremely loud so the person on the phone could not hear me. They kept repeating back the wrong date to me 3 times then finally getting it right. I was nervous it was wrong so was sure to call back and confirm. It's a nice size restaurant but not terribly big, lots of tables very close together. I came with a party of 9 for my birthday. They sat us at the one large high top they have. It was very uncomfortable because the chairs were too high for the table. We all had to crouch down to eat our food! Seriously please get new chairs for the table. As I already said it's extremely loud so it was hard to hear our server and hear each other talk. I do not recommend coming with a large group. It was a hot day and they had the garage doors open in the front which was fine but it was so hot, there was no AC on at all. They serve room temperature water but we all needed an ice water. I was eager to hear the specials but at 8pm on a Friday night they were already out which seemed odd to me.   All in all, I loved the food and will be back but they do have a few minor things to fix. I really really expected a great overall experience and I didn't get that but like I said the food makes up for it.",

DiAnoia's dishes were made perfectly, the ingredients were fresh and imported, and the ambiance was exciting. Our waiter knew so much about each dish and made our experience super friendly and comfortable. Other than the food, the service was awesome. From the fresh bread and whipped ricotta to the fried baby octopus, to the cappelletti primavera, the pancetta, and finally, the tiramisu, everything was so well-done. Thanks for a great night!",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for our morning coffees.  We had been past DiAnoias Eatery many times before while walking to the strip but have never stopped.  What made us stop today was the fact that we had the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport.  Whenever my wife and I first walked into the place we were somewhat confused about where to go.  We stood at the bar for a minute or two trying to order before realizing we had to walk up to the register (partially hidden beyond the bar) to place our order.  The inside of this place is quite large with a bar to order once you walk in and some display cases and coolers with a register past that.  They also have a huge dining room that could probably seat 60+ comfortably complete with a giant living edge communal table.  The windows that face out onto Penn are also on garage door track and we have seen them open in nice weather.  For our coffee today my wife went with an Americano while I went with a cappuccino and then we also decided to split some zeppoles as well.  After ordering we headed back to the bar where we had just been standing to wait for our coffees.  Whenever they were ready we grabbed them and proceeded back into the dining room and found a seat.  Our zeppoles were brought out to us a few minutes later still quite warm.  Man they were really good!  The middle of the zeppole felt a little wet even though it was cooked through possibly due to some ricotta giving it an interesting textural component.  Meanwhile the lemon flavoring gave it a little bit of freshness without overwhelming the doughnut.  Lastly my cappuccino here was solid as the milk was frothed nicely and the coffee was smooth.  With all that I had mentioned above, I probably would have given it 4 stars.  However, while we were waiting for our coffees my wife and I noticed that one of their sandwiches, a mortadella & ndjua, was showcased in an industry magazine.  As such, I decided I would stop by later after we had done our shopping in the strip district and get one to go.  So I did just that and took it home to eat.  The menu describes the sandwich as nduja mayo, mortadella, burrata, provolone, fried egg, giardinara and heirloom tomatoes all on a kaiser roll.  It was a massive sandwich and  I was surprised at how thick of a cut of mortadella was on the sandwich as it was maybe an inch thick.  The flavors of the sandwich were really good too and my favorite bites of the bunch were when I got the giardinara and the mortadella combined.  Without that giardinara, the mortadella was a lot.  By the time that I had finished the sandwich I was full and happy that I had gone back to get it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head to DiAnoias Eatery again in the future.  All of the food that I tried there was good and I look forward to trying even more.",

    "text": "All the 5 star yelp reviews have a common theme: the gnocchi in the bread bowl. I figured I HAD to try it, and it was basically the best life decision I've ever made! It was literally incredible. They also allow you to BYOB which is always a bonus for me and wine drinking friends. If i was yelping solely on my gnocchi, I would have to rate them 10 stars! However, I had to dock a star for a number of reasons... I went to DiAnoia's with a party of 9 for a friends birthday. The restaurant was not built to be a restaurant. It's one open space with very low ceilings. There was so many tables crammed in this small space and it was SO LOUD. I couldn't even have a conversation with everyone in my party :( I also hated our table. Like the actual table. It was a giant high top and the chairs were way higher than the table. I had to crouch down to eat my food. It was very uncomfortable. Also, what is this trend of serving tap water with no ice? WHY? JUST STOP. It was 80 on Memorial Day weekend, just chill the freakin water or give us some ice?! In all honestly though, they could serve boiling water and I'd still go back for that gnocchi!!  The lunch menu looks fantastic, so I'm really looking forward to going back, I just won't go back with a large group!",

I know this because I ordered way, WAY too much food,* and I'm not sad about any of it, not even the stomachache I have from trying to finish it all.  As a quality Italian eatery, I was not surprised to find that their meatballs are about as good as meatballs can be, and that the Italiano panino is top quality as well (that cherry pepper relish makes it pop).   If you arrive before 11 am on a weekday, the breakfast sandwich (add coppa if you know what's good for you) is an excellent choice, and pretty much the only one. The pizza is also good; sausages and hot peppers are a winner of a combo.  But I want to talk about the Ham & Cheese.   This is not your average sandwich. This is their fantastic house bread slathered with boursin cheese and stuffed to bursting with honey smoked ham that was tossed in a pan with a messy and generous amount of black garlic barbecue sauce and topped with pickled onions. It is holy fucking shit delicious, and I'm still dreaming about it. And it's only $10.   As an added bonus, DiAnoia's is bright, clean, staffed by the friendliest folks you'd ever want to have putting gigantic portions of Italian food in front of you, and it has what looks like the finest selection of amaro in Pittsburgh (sweet Montenegro tap handle).   Love this place. Love.  ____________  *All the food mentioned in this review was eaten in less than 24 hours, and it wasn't even all I ate. You made me fat, Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "We ate at DiAnoia's on a Saturday night and our experience started off pretty rocky. I made a reservation earlier in the week and the only available options were 5:30 and 9:30. We opted for the 9:30 reservation and confirmed later in the week. When we arrived at about 9:40 (a little late, admittedly), our table was not yet ready. We were seated about 7 minutes later and were informed by the host that the kitchen closes at 10pm- in just 13 minutes. This was pretty aggravating to the entire table and is definitely something that should've been communicated when the reservation was made. Perhaps we would've taken the earlier seating to avoid being rushed. To make matters worse, by 9:58 our server had not yet come to take our order. Concerned that we would be unable to order, we went searching for our server to ensure we got our order in before the kitchen closed.   We had the Spaghetti Limone with Shrimp and Gnocci with Meatballs. The gnocci dish was absolutely fantastic! The pasta and meatballs were fresh and homemade- altogether a great meal. The spaghetti dish was not nearly as good. The whole dish was very white and pretty bland- white spaghetti, white sauce, and white shrimp. It definitely could've used some vegetables, spice, and/or pancetta or something to add some flavor. The shrimp also seemed to have been frozen, not fresh. This is not what I would expect from a restaurant like DiAnoia's. This was also the server's recommendation, which was also disappointing.   I had a Sorrento's Torch cocktail, which was very seasonal and delicious.   Sadly, we were not offered any dessert and were just given our bill without being asked if we were interested. I suspect this was also due to our late reservation. Again, this should've been disclosed at the outset so we would've had the opportunity to choose the earlier reservation.   The gnocci and beverages are the only reason this review has 3 stars. The service and spaghetti dish warranted 1 star.",

For brunch I had a form of beef and grits - fantastic! From the  taste to the texture. For dinner I had pumpkin gnocchi and branzino - even their fish was great - very delicately sliced and seasoned to the perfect taste.

    "text": "Great food! Awful service. I had been looking forward to eating here for soooo long. I have heard nothing but truly good reviews. I had to make reservations 3 weeks in advance so I was really anticipating it here.   We had to utilize the high top table, which is fine but the chair to table ratio is awful. I'm short, 5'3 and I felt like a giant sitting there, my seat was way too high compared to the table. I didn't like that but it is what it is. The decor at this place was really nice, though. I loved the bottles as chandeliers and the wood table we sat at and the marble tables around us. Even the plates and glasses were super Italian. I loved it. Reminded me of home.   First let me talk about the service. Our waiter left a lot to be desired. When he came to our table the first thing he said was \"alright, what's everyone having?\" Ummm What? Lol. We said we need a minute, haven't even looked at the menus yet. And aren't you supposed to take our drink orders first? Anyway. We waited for a long time for our waiter. Everyone around us was getting their drinks and appetizers and we had nothing. We ended up having to ask someone to get him. He came back and we ordered everything at once just in case he didn't come back again. I ordered whipped ricotta as part of our appetizers and that never came out. We had to, again, ask someone else for it. We ended up eating all of the bread before we could even get the ricotta. What was cool though was that they gave us a free bread when my mom requested more. Our waiter never checked on us after getting our meals, though, and they brought them out separately so like three of us had to wait awhile while everyone else ate. It was just super messy and unorganized. I didn't enjoy the staff at all. Not very friendly.   The food, however, is the reason this place gets 4 stars. Wow! Great food!!! We ordered the couscous, the bread with whipped ricotta and the meat and cheese plate. All were really great. The couscous dish was so flavorful with mint and dill and apples. I would just eat that with the delicious garlic and cheesy bread! The meat and cheese plate is WAY over priced at $32. We make this plate at our get togethers and it has way more on it for less money. Yes, we get premium meet and cheese, too.  But still, theirs was good. I ordered the half Branzino. I'm picky about my fish but this was great! The skin was crispy and crunchy and the fish had a good, mild flavor. My mom ordered the mezzalune squash (not sure how to spell it lol) which was the best dish on the table. It was sweet and savory and citrusy. All of these flavors in one dish - one of the best I've ever had. Definitely top 5 dishes of my life. The mushroom pasta was really great too and I don't like mushrooms. The gnocchi and meatball was incredible! Honestly, the food was worth the bad service. We also brought home the homemade bread with raisins. SO GOOD.   Definitely try this place out! Maybe the service will be better for you. The food will be worth it! Sorry my photos suck, was too busy eating LOL!",

    "text": "Saw how good the brunch here looked on Instagram before the Facebook video about the gnocchi bread bowl went viral... so I was more compelled to try the brunch first and made a reservation for Sunday at 12PM. There seemed to be a lot of people so I was happy that I made a reservation beforehand. Come on a nice day because the natural lighting inside is on point! Their large windows really lighten up the place and their marble tables are great for insta pics.  I'm a big fan of Zeppole (and donuts in general) so of course we had to order. They were sooo good (just as I expected). And to my surprise they had a more lemony taste and a tad bit of salt, which was a good balance! It wasn't just a sweet donut but the pinch of saltiness made it enjoyable.   I ordered the Prosciutto Eggs Benedict. I was recently introduced to prosciutto and was drawn to try this eggs benedict. It was delicious but the side potatoes were way too salty. It was a shame that I couldn't finish them all. The dishes my friends ordered all looked appealing and appetizing, except for one - the Lemon & Ricotta Pancakes. There were 3 that came out with maple syrup on the side and powdered sugar sprinkled on top. The pancakes are pretty much like pamela's hotcakes. Nothing too special about this one, but I expected a little more considering how the other dishes seemed to look more special to DiAnoias.   Next time, I'd like to come back to see if the gnocchi bread bowl really lives up to the hype.",

The girls started out with rose spritz's which were refreshing. We also ordered the fresh baked bread with oil and whipped ricotta (omg) and the clam bake (equally omg). Both were really great apps! For dinner, I had the cacio e pepe and added shrimp. It was soooooooo so so good. It reminded me of my favorite meal when I was in Rome! My friends ordered the gnocchi sorrentino style, the cavatelli de pollo, and the agnello sugo. All of our pastas were delicious and you could tell they were homemade and done right! The only thing with the lamb papardelle (agnello sugo) was that my bf wished there was more of a red sauce with the dish, but this didn't stop him from eating :) We ALL had leftovers because the portions were large. Dessert was the biscotti & vin santo and the tiramisu, which were the bomb! I'm so glad I finally got to try DiAnoia's and can't wait to take my family there! *Also need to stop by for brunch :)",

My personal favorite is the Gnocchi (Sorrentina Style), which is served in a bread bowl and topped with 3 cheeses. Their red sauce is delicious and isn't too heavy for an otherwise hefty dish full of starches and cheese. Their breads and pastas are homemade and their quality is evident in the texture and taste. The service is always friendly and efficient. The menu is a la carte, so be aware when you look to build your meal. Naturally, they have a good wine selection by the glass/bottle, but I highly recommend their house wine available on draft. They also have a great selection of Italian cocktails and amaros. DiAnoia's is absolutely worth the price and is a superior Italian dining experience!",

    "text": "I LOVE this place.  I'm so glad I found it because it's so hard to find sauce and meatballs near the level of my mother's in a restaurant.  In fact, I've become SO offended by Italian restaurants over the past ten years that I've even sworn off ordering red sauce and/or meatballs in any restaurant, until DiAnoia's.   I went once for dinner in November for my birthday, and was thrilled!  We had the fresh bread with olive oil and parmigiano reggiano, and trust me, it was totally worth the cost.  When we first saw the price on the menu, we were like, \"this bread better have gold baked into it,\" but then it arrived and it was enormous.  But not only that, it was spectacular.  I had the gnocchi and meatballs for my entree.  The gnocchi were like pillows, and the meatballs were tender and flavorful.    Today I was there for lunch, and the format is completely different.  Grab a menu, stand in line, order, pick a table.  I don't absolutely hate that, but it's not my favorite way to dine out.  Aside from that, I was completely thrilled again.  We both had spaghetti and meatballs, and I cannot find anything wrong with anything I ate.  The sauce isn't sweet, but it's not tart or spicy either.  San marzano tomatoes definitely make a giant difference, I don't care who tells you what.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  The meatballs were once again tender and flavorful.  And most importantly, both bowls were brought out piping hot.  WITH cheese already on top for you.  Absolutely fab.    My only cons for the place are:  It's a little loud.  Maybe hang a tapestry or something.  (This would not go with the hipster vibe at all, I'm well aware.)  The hipster vibe.  I am not a hipster millennial.  I don't relate to everything having to be just a little quirky or \"elevated.\"  I just want the good food.  I feel like they could deliver the good food without having the air of trendy arrogance floating around.   I don't like that the lunch and dinner menus do not coincide.  Why can't I have pizza or spaghetti and meatballs for dinner?  Why can't I have gnocchi for lunch?   I get that they don't want to do breakfast all day, but in an off-the-boat authentic Italian place, I should be able to get the classics during all business hours.  And then that different format thing.  Casual for lunch?  Fine.  But make it casual for dinner, too, then.  Sit-down for dinner?  Nice.  But make it sit-down for lunch, then, too.  I don't want to have to relearn how a restaurant operates every time I go there.    Yes, the food is good enough to completely overlook the cons, but I like it when businesses -- of all kinds, not just restaurants -- make it easy to do business with them.  The fifth star for me is always detail related, and those nit-picky details are enough for me to take it away.  Definitely NOT food related at all.  The food is impeccable.  I just want all of it all the time, and I don't want to stand in line to order it, and I don't want to feel like an outsider while I'm eating.",

I'm glad I ended up here though because the food and service were fantastic!  Also, I apologize for making you plan C because you should have been plan A from the start.  I ended up going with the Gnocchi Sorrentino style in the bread bowl.  Just a heads up, the bread bowl version doesn't include meat, just a lot of cheese.  Overall it was really good, the bread bowl tasted fresh out of the oven.  It resembled the taste of a pizza crust.  Gnocchi is probably one of my least favorite pasta, but the way they did it here was just really delicious.  The gnocchi was soft enough where it didn't feel chewy, but still kept its form just fine.  The taste of basil and tomato was great.  It was way too big for me, I could've probably split it and an appetizer with someone else.    Overall, I had a great time here.  The service is super friendly and the food is fantastic!  I'm always happy to find good Italian food too because my area is seriously lacking in this category.  Thank you for making my trip down to Pittsburgh a memorable one!",

While I don't have anything particularly negative to report, I also don't have anything particularly amazing to report either. It has a great menu and food that I can recommend to anyone who is ok with paying for a finer dining experience. I would be interested to try their pizza and other pastas.",

For dinner I had cacio e pepe and I realize that includes black pepper but that was the only flavor in the whole dish. It was extremely overpowering. My friends got the gnocchi bread bowl which was really good. On top of that the service was not good. We overheard the couple next to us order the exact same meal as us at least 10 minutes after us and they received theirs before us so that was irritating. Probably wouldn't go back.",

Anyhow, my boyfriend's pasta came out under cooked ( not al dente) and to make matters worse the manager exclaimed that she spoke to the kitchen and the chef said it was cooked \"super al dente\" - \"done correctly\" I am italian, we do not eat our pasta that hard and chewy.. and as a manager you do not resolve an issue by telling your guest you are wrong for not liking how something is prepared. If your kitchen serves pasta nearly raw, then that should be part of service that is explained and ask your guests for a preference how they wish for their pasta to be cooked.",

Tender and delicious. On to dinner.  My son got the gnocchi and meatballs. I can't imagine this dish being any tastier. My wife had the seafood pasta. Not great. I would go elsewhere on the menu. I went way out of my wheelhouse and tried the spring pea sacchettoni.  Wow. Right up my alley and a flavor experience to be remembered. Ended with a slightly burnt pistachio cannoli and a cappuccino. Great dining experience. Go here...",

I'd wanted to visit for months, and finally had the chance to go to celebrate my birthday this weekend.  When we arrived, we waited about five minutes to be greeted.  It's a busy Saturday night, that seems reasonable enough.  To wait another ten minutes for our server (or anyone for that matter) to stop at our table isn't.  When he arrived, he told us to place our entire order then, to make it easier for the kitchen.  Okay...we weren't in any hurry, but we did have plenty of time to decide, so we ordered.  Our drinks came well after our first course, and the wine I ordered to go with my meal came when I was nearly done.    As far as dessert, I was on the fence - the server said \"it's your birthday, have something - it's on me.\"  I ordered one  *incredibly delicious* cookie and a latte.  He brought it and another small treat with a candle in it.  Nice touch, but a little disappointing to see the charge on the bill, given the offer.    Overall, the food was wonderful but the service was lacking enough to have put a damper on our celebration.",

    "text": "We went here after hearing good things and it lived up to the hype. The ambience was bright, clean and an open space. There were windows that opened onto Penn Ave. and it was a nice, airy feel. There were larger tables that looked good for bigger groups.   We ordered three entrees for two of us because we love to taste everything. We had gnocchi and meatballs. Gnocchi and meatballs both were really big, both had a nice consistency. The gnocchi was light but not so light that it lacked density in the center. The meatballs were flavorful and soft. I thought they could have had more flavor but when I ate them the following day as leftovers I loved them more. I think it was a matter of eating several competing flavors at dinner and my palate was overwhelmed. That's my bad.   Cacio a pepe- my favorite. I think. Pasta with cheese, cracked pepper and I think there was cream. It was like eating Italian mac n cheese and it was so incredibly good. I ate the most of this dish. My husband avoids creamy food but even he was gobbling on this one.   Finally, we had rabbit tagliatelle. At first, we took it for granted. The other two were so flavorful that this dish fell flat. Almost. Then, after a few bites I really started to appreciate the understated flavors working together in this dish. It wasn't too rich, it was unpredictable and so good in the most humble way. It didn't need to show off with pretty red sauce or weighty cream.   Couldn't fit in dessert but the limoncello was smooth and strong, which is not easy to pull off. I loved the restaurant and can't wait to go back. Didn't find it to be expensive and it was nice enjoying the Strip District at night time again. Also, can't forget, very friendly, knowledgeable service. Maybe it was Nikki? Not sure but she was awesome. She made sure we enjoyed our experience and it was much appreciated.",

All were absolutely delicious but my favorite was the zeppole- cooked to perfection they were warm and had a great lemon hint.   The Bloody Mary was also different but delicious. It looked like they added olive oil which was a nice touch.   My mom and I went with the special breakfast pizza. It had chickpeas, roasted peppers, some type of pesto, fresh porchetta and a runny egg. This was perfect. My brother got the steak Florentine and it is a huge portion but I think he licked the plate. My dad went with prosciutto eggs Benedict which he loved - it was the perfect size for him. My sister went with the veal Parmesan which tasted liked your great grandmother made it. Lastly, my sister in law went with the Americana, cooked perfectly and the potatoes had a nice crisp.   Nicole, our waitress, was absolutely phenomenal. She was patient and knew how to describe the menu and give recommendations.  She even gave us a nice Selection of dessert pastries at the end.   I definitely recommend this venue and hope to go again soon.",

    "text": "Very disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. Had out of town family visiting and decided to go for dinner based on the reviews.   Made reservations and were seated right away.  The server brought water which was warmer than lukewarm.  We had to ask for ice.  The wine selection by glass was minimal and entirely overpriced.  Much more extensive bottle menu (highly overpriced as well).  As a result, we stuck with water and iced tea.  Could not believe bread was not included with meal--in an Italian restaurant--but you could order it for an additional $8!!!  Ripoff!!  Paid $18 for an order of gnocchi and meatballs, and nothing else included.  Salad was an additional $8 or $9 dollars.  The gnocchi were very good but meatballs too heavy and dense.  Prices entirely too high for what is offered.  Not a good value at all.  Was embarrassed to have brought my family here.  Service was good, however.  I really wanted to like this restaurant, but will not be back.",

However, the bar had seating and so we ponied up and grabbed a bite. The bartender was delightfully chatty in her red updo and made great suggestions! The meal was quite delicious and we enjoyed our time watching some of the yummy looking meals pass by while we dined. The price was a bit elevated for the quantity however the quantity combined with the quality was satisfying. It is definitely on the repeat list!",

    "text": "Pittsburgh can always use more restaurants that serve truly authentic Italian cuisine and Di'Anoia's is here to do just that. My husband and I went for dinner during restaurant week so we were able to take advantage of both the fixed menu and the a la carte one. But first - the ambiance! I've been to Italy a number of times and Di'Anoia's would fit in perfectly with the any side-street restaurants in Rome. It's amazing that the space was an old bridal salon, because it feels as though it was meant to be a restaurant - not at all forced. There are chandeliers made of bottles and wine glasses, and the tables are perfectly boutique styles. I also have to mention our waiter (maybe Eric - I'm so bad with names!). He was perfectly attentive and nice. You could tell that he loved working there (you can always tell a lot about a restaurant by their staff).  We first ordered the house wine (which is on tap) in a 3/4 bottle. You can definitely taste that it's from a tap, the first pour has that carbonated taste to it. Not a bad thing, just a bit strange. Served in an unlabeled bottle and with regular glasses, we felt transported into an Italian bistro right away.  The meal came with delicious thinly sliced focaccia drizzled with olive oil and balsamic. We both ordered appetizers: I had the greens and beans, my husband had the brussel sprouts. The greens and beans were delicious, I definitely recommend! The brussel sprouts were very different than what we expected. I will admit that we didn't notice if there was a description to them, and we didn't ask when we ordered. They are served with an almond cream-like sauce - I would even go as far as comparing the sauce as a soup versus a sauce. It was good, not what we expected but still pretty tasty.  Our main courses were really heavenly: my husband ordered the gnocchi and I had the tagliatelle. I like j gobbled up my tagliatelle in roughly 15 seconds (maybe a little longer). It was really authentic. The noodles were perfectly handmade. The gnocchi and meatballs (and that sauce!) were also incredible.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu. It was perfectly soaked and the espresso was delicious. I would definitely get it again.  All in all, I can't wait to go again and try more on the menu. Reading other reviews, it sounds like breakfast is a must too! Looking forward to making our way back!",

I ordered the eggs in purgatory (eggs in arrabbiata sauce with bread to soak up the sauce), and my husband ordered the veal parmesan. We also ordered some zeppole to share.   Unfortunately, after ordering, it took over an hour to get our food! The waiter was apologetic and, after quite a while, brought us a cornetto (Italian croissant) to share while we waited. The cornetto, as it turns out, was delicious - no complaints about that.   When we got our food, it was good, but nothing really wowed me. The veal in the veal parmesan was tasty, but the sauce and pasta served alongside it weren't anything special. The arrabbiata sauce with my eggs definitely had a lot of flavor, but the bread served with it seemed a bit stale. We finally got our zeppole after our main dishes. Some of them were perfect - sweet with a lemony kick, but a couple of them were definitely raw in the middle.",

    "text": "Part of me doesn't want to write a good review because I don't want DiAnoia's to get too popular. But man, this place was fantastic from start to finish and I'm nothing if not honest. There were four of us, all of whom are hogs, so we ate the following things:  - Tortellini en brodo.  My friend and I nearly came to blows over who got to drink the broth at the end.  This was a real standout.  - Gnocchi.  The lightest and fluffiest I've seen in a long time.  - Amatrician.  My favorite dish, so I've had it everywhere, and this was done extremely well and with a pasta I'd never seen before that was perfect for grabbing the sauce.  - Wild boar pasta.  Any time B sees this, he orders it, and this, while slightly sweet, did not disappoint.  - The garlic bread.  The like $3 garlic bread was outstanding, to the point where we got 2.  - The bread pudding.  YOU GUYS THE BREAD PUDDING.  It comes in a coffee cup and is basically soaked with espresso, which is a very good thing.    All of the food was truly wonderful, and the service was great.  My only complaint has to do with ambiance/decor.  It's very bright and white, which is probably great during the day but at night felt like it could use some softening.  It's also pretty loud, with not a lot to dampen the noise (concrete floors, lots of windows). That said, this place has been open for about four days, so I'm sure they are adjusting things as time goes on.    Highly, highly recommend.  I suspect I'll be back within a week.",

It's the perfect way to start the meal.  Tonight, I got the gnocchi with meatballs.  Last time I got the gnocchi, Sorrentina Style, which is placed inside a warm bread bowl with tons of cheese for an additional $10. I couldn't stray from the gnocchi on my second visit as I loved it so much during my first visit.  I did happen to get a bite of my sister in law's sausage and apple rigatoni, which was equally as tasty.  Something that's always a big bonus is having vegetarian options, as my wife is a vegetarian.  They don't have a ton of vegetarian choices, but the ones they do have are remarkable.  We got the Zeppoles for dessert during both visits, which are freshly made, soft, warm doughnuts covered in powdered sugar and we also got the Tiramisu to split.  The coffee taste was a little strong for my liking, but I still thought it was incredibly high quality. So far, DiAnoia's has hit it out of the park each time.  I hope to go back again soon, and try something new.  I have no reason to give these guys anything other than 5 stars!",

But, of course, we Elites must get our reviews in early... needless to say, there were some kinks today. I arrived a little after noon and the place was fairly crowded. There was no table service, everyone had to stand in line at the register to order. I was going to get the roasted cauliflower or a panini, but then I heard the wait time was 40 minutes. Whoa. I ordered a small house salad and hot, crusty bread with EVOO and Parmesan. The house salad was pre-made and handed to me immediately. I assumed the bread would not take 40 minutes. I scrounged up a plastic fork and nice quality napkin and sat at the cafe bar to dig into my salad. It was amazing! The ingredients were fresh and healthy, but the salad dressing was to die for. An extremely flavorful Italian vinegarette. Unfortunately, the bread took a long time. I'm not sure how long because I was chilled out with my phone. The great thing was the coffee guy (I forget the fancy name for this) went back to check on my order and a lovely woman came and offered me a bakery treat! The bread came shortly after all this attention and I have to say it was worth the wait. It was hot. It was crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It had a wonderful olive oil and Parmesan drizzle on the top. I can't wait to try more from the menu. Thursday, Nov 3, they will be fully open for dinner. If you don't want to experience the new restaurant growing pains, you'll want to wait a few weeks. I may go back on Thursday to try out an entree.",

It was nice not to have to stress about finding a spot. I had a reservation, so we were seated right away, but it was crowded without being packed so I think we would have been okay even without a reservation (this was 11:30 on a Sunday).   We had a cute table right by the large windows. It was a good seat, and would have been even better if it was summer and the garage-type doors would be open. I will definitely come back in the warmer weather just for this.   We shared the zeppoli as a starter and it was awesome! The donuts were really dense, but had a lemon zest that kept them from being too heavy. I definitely could have ordered like three of that for my meal.   For breakfast I had the americano which was like the traditional breakfast. The eggs were good -- a tad undercooked but many people like them that way so I won't hold that against anyone. The potatoes were crispy and well seasoned. The pancetta was basically just thin bacon in a swirl -- good but nothing to blow my mind. What DID blow my mind was the bagel-bun. WOW -- sooo good. Like a dense bagel without the hole in the middle. Crispy but not crumby on the outside and super soft in the middle. Amazing.   Service was a bit slow but our waiter was clearly running all over the place so no big deal! I'll definitely come back for brunch and to try dinner as well.",

Lots of good flavors and perfect to share. For the rest of our meal we got a bunch of shareables. The items came out at a good pace. Waiter was attentive but not obtrusive.",

    "text": "We read the reviews and decided to try this place out and were utterly disappointed.   Food is below average compared to other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their panini is overly seasoned and I can only taste the vinegar soaked bread. Their meatball is under seasoned and tastes bland. Their pasta is overcooked.   Everything on the menu is on the pricier side, given the quality.  Service is below average. During our first visit, I have to walk over and grab a bottle of tap water myself as the waiting staff is not very attentive.",
