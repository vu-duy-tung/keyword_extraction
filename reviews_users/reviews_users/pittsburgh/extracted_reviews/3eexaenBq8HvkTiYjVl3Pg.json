Reason I gave 4 star is because I was not a fan of the bang bang shrimp (lacked flavor) and I also tasted a Vietnamese noodle bowl, bowl was good and cooked well however I did not care for their fish sauce.

I usually just go and grab subway when I made shopping trips out here to Mcknight Road, but today I was in the mood for some stir fry.  Ofcourse, a lot of the places on McKnight Road are Sushi places and I guess this one is both Sushi and Thai food.  I got the Hawaiian noodle dish.  It tastes quite a bit like Mei Fun and yet they have Thai style noodles in there with pineapple and some veggies.  You may choose your own meat and I got tofu.  Ahhh, I ordered the Vietnamese coffee and it came with the tiny metal pot on top of the glass.  It is an interesting way to serve the coffee, but I didn't like the coffee.  They offer condensed milk and half and half.  I kind of wish they had soy milk, or almond milk.  Anyways, the dish was really quite good.  It was well cooked, spiced and it came out in a timely manner.  The wait staff was nice and helpful.  There was also a nice old man with a nice smile and that always helps.  The restaraunt is clean and modern looking.  There was not many people in the place when I was there.  I enjoyed it and I would certainly come back if I find myself on McKnight Road and hungry after shopping.   The one thing about this place that sucks is I think the name.  It's so bland, which is not like their food.  They need a creative name that tells us about their food.  The price point is really nice and especially for what you get.  My food came with a small salad and a spring roll.  Yum!!!",

The lunch prices were reasonable and I was both excited and overwhelmed by the number of choices.   they aren't Cheesecake Factory crazy, but their menu and concept could stand for some editing.   Too many cuisines and too many options.  I wanted to try bento box and probably should have, but I went with the crab rangoons and some pad Thai.  The rangoons were curried, which again, was a little muddled.  They weren't bad, but I wouldn't order them again.  The pad thai was actually quite tasty and I was pleased to see that they aren't afraid of spice.  I ordered a 3 out of 5 and it was perfect.  Enough to feel it, but not so much that you struggle to eat it.   The lunch entrees were supposed to come with soup or salad, but our server skipped that part.  We had her bring them at the end just to try.  The ginger salad (think Japanese restaurant) was definitely lackluster (the dressing wasn't good at all), so I'd try the soup next time.

    "text": "They have potential.  I went on opening day for a late afternoon lunch since we saw that they opened. My husband originally ordered a Green Dragon roll and Som Tum and sticky rice (which apparently also comes with chicken). I ordered Vietnamese Spring rolls and Pho Dac Biet. So, we were notified they did not have the ingredients for papaya salad so my husband had to order a new dish, which he the chicken vermicelli bowl. We were a bit upset for opening day that they didn't have ingredients for a fairly simple dish.  My husband said his sushi however was great and he will definitely come back for sushi. When my spring rolls came out, they were the wrong ones. I was handed fried Thai ones. So I notified the server and I was brought out a different set of spring rolls, which was still not fresh Vietnamese ones as described in but some other fried ones. I didn't bother bringing it up at this point because I didn't want to get another wrong order.  Meals: My pho came extremely late. They apologized for it, which I do appreciate, however, I was a bit irked because friends of theirs came in well after us and after I had ordered my food, and sat down and had their meals before us. The food seemed to be coming out of the kitchen no where near in order. My pho was ok. I prefer a sweeter pho, but that's just me. I was given extra tripe which was great, however I asked for fish sauce and never heard back on that request. Also, my beef in my pho was not good. I was given all the cuts that still had loads of fat on it, so I didn't bother eating much of my meat. Otherwise, my pho was ok. My husbands meal came out and again, we received the wrong order. It was the vermicelli bowl but he got pork instead of chicken. He ate it just because we didn't want to wait any longer and it seemed like we were just getting wrong orders here and there so we didn't even bother.  All in all, my husband and I both agree we will give them a try again. I love having a local place to grab some pho and other dishes, especially when I don't feel like making pho at home!  They did apologize for everything and gave us 15% off which we appreciate, but admittedly, this was not a great meal experience.  Their servers were very nice but did not seem to have focus that day. We had 3 different people serving us. So I think if there is more focus on covering a few tables so we all get the service we request and correct meals, then I think it will be great.  Don't let my review stop you from visiting! I can only review though based on my experience. I will edit after we visit again!",

The sushi here is easily some of the best I've ever had, and the portions are very generous. The staff is polite and gracious, and the service is quick. This has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in the area, I want to say my boyfriend and I come about once a week.   I highly recommend this restaurant if you are interested in Thai cuisine, sushi, or pho. You will not be disappointed. The McKnight kitchen deserves much more recognition and business.",

Very little redecorating has been done.  You have to penetrate past the veil of previous failures.   Not a good start.... however that is my only critique.   We ordered four entrees, including the pho and pad thai.  Everything was delicious, fresh and served up hot.  Friendly waitress, and a tiny error in our order was handled very graciously. Not crowded and not expensive.... I think the third time is truly a charm for this location.  Being the only pho in McKnight Road does not diminish the well earned title of best pho on McKnight Road.  Yum!",

I went for dinner on a Monday night; the restaurant was fairly empty when I arrived, but seemed to pick up towards the end of my meal.  I had the Pho #1 Rare Eye Round ($10) and wasn't very impressed.  While the beef and noodles were delicious, the broth itself was lacking.  When the pho arrived, I could smell the delicious flavors associated with pho like star anise and clove.  However, I was unable to taste any of those flavors.  I also had the Tom Kha soup with tofu ($5), and it was honestly some of the best Tom Kha I've ever had!  It was super flavorful and packed with delicious veggies and well-prepared tofu.  I would go back for this soup alone!  The decor is nice and modern with ample seating options, and the restaurant itself is very clean.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.

I ordered the sashimi sake (salmon), ginger salad, and fried rice.   I am very dissatisfied. The salmon had a slight hint of fishiness (meaning it's not 100% fresh). The ginger salad had no flavor and the fried rice was over done.   I will not be returning.. Which is a shame because I wanted to eventually try their PHO",

I still haven't ordered a drink and I had questions about the menu. She finally returned and she didn't know the answer to my question. Finally took our order, never gave silverware, or bowls for soy sauce. We ordered 4 different rolls that all came on one plate. I wanted to know which ones were witch but she didn't return. I had to go get my own napkins and silverware from the service station myself. We ended up using out dishes for the soy sauce. Then as we sat there finished waiting for the check she passed us twice without bringing it. I finally had to go to the front counter and ask for it.",

    "text": "This restaurant takes over the ol' Burger 21 place that occupied the venue for about 6 months to a year.  The signs for burgers shakes and fries on the bright red awnings are painted over with black.   The interior is definitely malt shop chic, an asian fusion restaurant possessing the body of a burger joint, still, they make it work...the shake counter is now a sushi bar.    There are some growing pains it would seem.  When I walked in it took what felt like an awkwardly long time for the young man behind the register to glance up at me from what he was working on (phone?).  It may have only been 30 seconds, but when you're standing in front of someone who doesn't look up, it seems like forever.    The place was relatively empty.  The booths lining the walls were filled but the interior tables were vacant.  He surprised me when he seated me by saying he wanted to place me at a table by the window so he wouldn't forget about me.    He gave me the menu...and then appeared to forget about me.    I overheard him telling nearly every customer thank you for your patience, but it honestly didn't take long once I'd placed my order to get my food.    They must have been short staffed, he returned to tell me that the sushi chef was helping in the kitchen so it would be a few more minutes until I got my Arizona rolls, but my shrimp pad thai arrived relatively quickly.    They brought my sushi out...but it was someone else's.  They then brought the right order and it was delicious.  So ultimately...the pad thai was good.  The sushi rolls were good.  They did that thing that I hate where they left the tails on the shrimp so I had to pick them up with  my fingers to remove the tails, but I couldn't tell if it was on purpose.  There were probably six or so shrimp and maybe three of them had tails on and three did not.  So either they're inconsistent in their preparation, or they leave the tails on...either way, room for improvement.  The taste of all of my food was really good.    When I got up to pay my bill the server again apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience, noting that...as I could see...everyone came all at once.  But...it was still just as half full as it had been when I showed up.    Whatever the reason for the apologies and waits and incorrect orders, they were all minor issues.  The food was good.  The price was reasonable.  The \"wait\" was not long.  I think maybe just a little inexperience on the part of the staff and possibly a no-show in the kitchen.  No reason to turn you away from trying them out.    I would definitely go back for a casual lunch or dinner.  Not really a date-worthy place, but a good work lunch atmosphere.",

    "text": "I gotta admit, I was really looking forward to this place?  Now, we came during an off hour, so service was actually great? Our main courses did take awhile though.  Now, I had ordered the eggplant tempura, which was only 5 pieces for a hefty price, I didn't really think it was worth it. The trend continued with the miso udon, $13 for literally two cups of soup, barely any vegetables. I felt pretty skimped on it to be honest.   It was delicious, yes, but the miso udon definitely was lacking, more of a filler I guess.  I also ordered the volcano roll, which was a bit heavy in mayonnaise. I was happy that the fish on top was toasted and warm, but the roll underneath was ice cold and pretty flavorless, so it made a contrast between the topping and bottom that didn't quite work. Perhaps baking the California roll underneath along and using more crab salad with help?  I'll probably be back at some point, but not very frequently due to high prices for smaller portions. I could easily go to sushi tomo for less expensive and more flavorful dishes.   A huge plus to this place is the consistent addition of new dishes, it definitely maintains a customer base and keeps it interesting.",

The spiciness scale was 1-5 but even 5 wasn't very spicy. However the service was extremely fast, with appetizers coming out in 10 minutes and entrees within another 10-15 minutes. The satay was crispy but a bit on the smaller side, the garlic edamame was very good and garlicky. While the curry wasn't to my taste my dad enjoyed it and the other three dishes were great! Pho broth was tasty even though the meat was mostly cooked through (just the slightest hint of pink). All the portions are huge and definitely worth the value.",

As soon as I walked in, the first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was totally silent--they didn't have any music playing in the background, so my friend and I picked a table in the back so we wouldn't feel as conspicuous. A little uncomfortable, to be honest. That being said, the food came out very quickly and was absolutely DELICIOUS. We got crab ragoons and a philly roll to start. The ragoons have plenty of filling and were nice and crispy. My friend got the pho soup, which was a giant portion the size of his head. He said he enjoyed it. I got the sweet and sour Thai chicken, which was absolutely amazing. We ate every single bite and were completely stuffed! I enjoyed it so much I ordered take out from grub hub a few days later and ordered the same thing--which was perfect again! Probably won't be back to dine in though.",

Way too much rice used, and the eel tasted a bit fishy, but the rolls were hard to beat.

I went around dinner time one weekday evening and there were only a few people other than myself in the restaurant. I would probably blame the location a bit for that, as several other restaurants failed in the same location. But the service was great, they seemed to have a pretty deep menu of sushi and other mixed Asian cuisine. Ended up with Pad See Ew and it was very good and the portion was very fair as well. McKnight Kitchen is now one of the better Asian food option in the McKnight area, second to Sesame Inn, but leaps and bounds better than Panda Express just up the road.",

It was pretty empty with only about 3 parties.   The menu is huge, comparable to the cheesecake factory. You have plenty to choose from here with Thai curry dishes, ramen dishes, chef specials, sushi and more - most at reasonable prices. The staff was very friendly and offered help in deciding on the menu.  We tried the Green Curry with shrimp and the Hawaiian Noodle dish with shrimp. Both dishes were authentic, flavorful and delicious. The noodle dish was a spin on pineapple fried rice, instead with stir fried thin rice noodles pineapple, cashew nuts and a hint of curry powder. The green curry was different that most I've tried in the area as instead of eggplant it had bamboo strips. Very good!   Overall, a really great experience! Will definitely be returning to try more of the menu items and for the sushi happy hour :)",

It had yummy tripe, meat balls, eye round, and other beef.  -I loved how they packaged their pho to go, since they didn't want it to get soggy on the way.  - since they forgot to include my order of pad see ew, they did call me and tell me they would refund me for it, but with the steep delivery fee-- was it worth it?  THE CONS: -they forgot to include my order of pad see ew! -the broth of the pho was just alright  -lots of packaging trash. Wish there was a way to be greener about it.  -high delivery fee.",

This place seems to have glowing reviews and we were excited to try it.  Two stars for the pho, which was quite good. I wish they had a vegetarian version though.  The pad Thai and egg rolls were a complete miss.... if you've never had good, authentic Asian food (sushi, Thai, Vietnamese) this might be the spot for you. For us.... it was a miss.

I then waited for 10 minutes before a waitress came over to take my order since they were busy talking. When my food finally came, I needed a water refill...didnt get a water refill. In fact I didnt get any additional service. I tried to be patient and wait for my check but they were busy eating and talking. Finally after waiting for over 10 minutes I asked the lady for a to-go container. She brought the container and walked away. She watched me struggle to get my Pho into the container as a spilled a good amount onto the table in the process. She soon as I put my lid on, the waitress came right back with the check. I love Pho and have had much better Pho and customer service. Not worth the time, money or food!!!",

We got the shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and the Las Vegas (salmon, crab, and cream cheese, and the whole thing was deep fried) rolls and they were all decent. The specialty rolls like the Las Vegas are definitely worth a try, especially during happy hour. Crab rangoon came out piping hot, crispy the way it should be. The crispy duck noodle soup was delicious, I highly recommend it! The duck was super flavorful and the skin was perfectly crispy as promised. The Hawaiian fried rice was not as great, it was a little mushy. The service was great too, our waitress was really friendly. They have a parking lot so it's very easy to get to.",

I came to dine in today and we order our appetizers- I ordered sushi and Tom Kia soup with modifications to it. and everything came out of the kitchen out of order. My soup came before everyone it was not modified the way I asked for it. And when she sent it back to be corrected the main dishes came out not the appetizer so we said never mind and my soup never came out. I only recommend eating as take out and check your orders to make sure they are correct!",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to love it here! I drive past it all of the time and love that they serve a few different Asian cuisines. I stopped in with a sushi craving tonight with my 20-month-old son. Our server was incredibly nice and helpful and interacted sweetly with my son. She brought water right out, including a cup with a lid and straw for him.  They didn't give me a kids menu and when I asked if they had a smaller portion of the stir fry, she didn't mention a kids menu, so I assume they don't have one. She suggested the fried rice with chicken added as a smaller option, and I went with that. I also ordered the fresh spring rolls, two California rolls and a ginger salad. I'm pregnant, so I was limited to tempura and vegetarian rolls, which left me with about three options.   First out was the salad, which was a larger portion than I get at most Asian restaurants. Unfortunately, I HATED the dressing - but I think it is more of a preference. I like the sweeter, creamier ginger dressings and this was almost like a ginger puree. I only ate a few bites.  The California roll was good! Not the best I've ever had but nowhere near the worst. But I don't feel like I can accurately judge their sushi because I tried the simplest of the rolls.   The spring rolls had a great taste and I liked the dipping sauce, but they were mostly cabbage.   My son kept saying, \"Yum,\" about his chicken fried rice, but there was very little chicken in it. He kept asking for more and when I told him I couldn't find any he said, \"Mama! Chicken missing!\" I had tried a bite and it was good. Mall level.  Unfortunately, the price wasn't mall level. If I'd paid half the price I'd probably feel \"meh\" about the whole thing, but I'm pretty disappointed. With so many great Asian restaurants near us, we probably won't be back.",

Once I was ready for my check, there were only 3 tables in use but waited 7 minutes card in hand while waitress was eating her lunch at the sushi bar. I expected the lunch specials not to be a thing on sundays but their menus made no reference to it being exempt...merely \"lunch menu 11-3.\" Food quality close to Nicky's but worth the extra 5 minute drive for the full dining experience along with outdoor seating",

I went with my family and we had the Bang Bang Shrimp, Pot Stickers and Summer Egg rolls!! All amazing!! Only complaint, my one egg roll stated to fall apart before I event started to eat it, so it ended up being more of a salad. Still yummy though!   For my main, I had Pad See Ew! I went with a 2 on the spicy scale but probably could have went with the 3 as I like a bit more of a kick with my food. But overall, it was very good! I actually ate the entire thing. The portion sizes are really generous. My mom and sister ended up bringing some of their dish home with them.   I would definitely come back to this restaurant again, next time I would probably bring a sweater because I was sat right below the air vent and was quite chilly the whole time.",

    "text": "The name is misleading, but this place has a lot of Asian food ranging from Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. (It looks like it used to be another restaurant, because on the banner outside you can see faded text.)  We walk in and the restaurant is empty so we were immediately seated. Browsed the menu and it looks like they have like a sushi happy hour from 3 PM - 6 PM on Tuesdays.   Vietnamese coffee: my friend got this and loved it. She said there was too much condensed milk, but she used just the right amount to suit her taste. I like condensed milk so I just ate what she couldn't finish lol.  CA Roll: my friend and I ordered this as an appetizer. It came with 8 pieces. The crab meat is actually not shredded up, but it still tasted decent for Pittsburgh. I actually really enjoyed it.  Vermicelli: we ordered a chicken vermicelli, but then we changed our mind to pork, but they came out with chicken. Despite how good the char on the chicken looked when it was cooked, this was honestly my least favorite dish. It had no flavor and even when we added more fish sauce and soy sauce, it still was missing the savory, salty, and sour aspect for vermicelli. I wonder if we had gotten with pork, would it have tasted better? But regardless, the noodles and the veggies didn't harmonize.  Pad see ew: this was the best. We got it with beef and it was amazing. The egg was really flavorful and the whole dish was cooked to perfection. I would definitely get this again. The meat was chewy and charred very well.  Overall it was just OK.  TL;DR The Thai food here was amazing. Do not get the vermicelli.  Also a tip to the server, when people are dining, try not to mention anything related bowel movements. I asked if they had pickled jalapeno sauce (because I like to pour that over my pad see ew), but she told me that they don't have it because people get diarrhea. Fair warning, but at least my friend and I found it super funny. Luckily, my friend and I are cool about that sort of thing, but majority of customers might not be. She definitely gave us a good laugh, but please be careful next time! Thank you.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to writing this review this evening after having a simply fantastic meal. So to do it right I waited until just after midnight to mix myself a Vesper Martini, select a fine cigar from my collection and sit under the stars because that my friends is what McKnight Kitchen deserves!  First I am going to get this out of the way, the name is misleading and unfortunately I fell victim to it since they have opened. Nothing about the name screams tasty Thai and Vietnamese which hurts me in all of the feels because this is indeed tasty Thai and Vietnamese!  It also doesn't help that the old awnings were painted over black but still visibly say \"Burgers, Hot Dogs, Shakes, Salads...\" but let's just move past that like we didn't see it as I'm sure the proprietors want us to shall we.  Several years ago when living in Akron, Ohio I was blessed with an amazing small little Thai joint called Siamone's (look up my review). I loved it! One day, Siamone said no more and Siamone's was but a memory. I never quite knew how to say goodbye to Siamone's until today when I ate the best Panang Chicken Curry of my life. In a moment of clarity it came to me.  Fare thee well Siamone's, you will always be my first love.  Incredible! The flavors were smooth and delectable with the perfect heat coming in at a 4 on their 5 point spice scale. The ratio of chicken to vegetable and curry was perfect in the dinner portion which was enough for leftovers (but I wasn't having that) clocking in at just $13. I cannot say enough good about this dish and cannot wait to explore more options.  My friend who is a self certified New Yawker with a penchant for being a food snob had the Pad Thai and pronounced it the best she had ever had.  And of course I complimented the meal with a nice Vietnamese Iced Tea. If you haven't had one, you are in for a treat! Now I haven't been to SE Asia and am not here to debate authenticity but for a fantastic Asianesque meal in Pittsburgh, I have to strongly recommend this place.  We also tried the edamame and Thai egg rolls which were both pretty good but not showstoppers. I did really enjoy and take note of the house-made dipping sauce.    The atmosphere was nice with mellow music playing at a relaxing volume. There was a Tv with the game on that I didn't need but some may enjoy. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. You can tell they take pride in the business. I even had a conversation with the owner's nephew and asked that he share my compliments with him.  I can't wait for my next meal here.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for lunch.  McKnight Kitchen is located on you guessed it, McKnight Road.  It's in the building that formerly housed both Qdoba and Burger 21 and so is only accessible heading Northbound on McKnight.  The inside of the restaurant was bright and open with a number of booths and tables.  There was also an area where a sushi chef was making the sushi fresh as it was ordered.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the chicken hot basil lunch special at the highest spice level while my wife went with a pad Thai.    The menu described my meal as chili paste with bell pepper, onion, bamboo shoots and basil leaves.  Then since it was a lunch special it also came with a spring roll and my choice between a soup and a salad and I went with the chicken rice soup.  The soup came out first and ended up being quite tasty.  After I had finished that my entree came out.  It looked fairly spicy with all of the red specks on it and its taste corresponded with its look.  The chicken was cooked nicely and my favorite part of the meal was how the basil paired well with the spiciness of the sauce.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our food and it's a much needed addition to the McKnight road dining scene.",

The sushi was expensive, took forever even though there was only one other table in the restaurant, and didn't taste very good at all. There was a bone in my yellowfish. Service was mediocre at best. On the other hand, the curry, pho, and chicken satay appetizer were all great. If you want to try this place, I'd recommend getting takeout and staying away from the sushi.",

Highly doubt if there were another pho place with 5 miles. Seafood pho had 3 shrimps, 2 scallops and others. More than what I expected.   Their curry was on the coconut milk side. Lots of coconut milk. Not so much curry favour. Perhaps having it spicy might help (we had 1/5 hot)  Mango sweet rice was more expensive than other place ($7). But not the best. The rice was too dry.",

The summer rolls were big. It was more than I expected. It also has chicken and shrimp in it which was unexpected. I don't eat chicken so I had to send it back and get a new one which they were very understanding of. My main course I had panang curry. So Bomb! It was a thick curry sauce which was unexpected. I good surprise. It comes with zucchini carrots and your choice of protein which I ordered shrimp. It's a nice portion size. It also comes with a side of rice and there was plenty left over. I ordered additional rice to go for later. I will be back to try several other things.",

I ordered a spicy tuna roll and Pho #1 my girlfriend got crab Rangoon's and the roasted pork noodle soup. The tuna roll was really fresh he made it right at the counter in the front of the store! The crab Rangoon's came out shortly after my roll did. They were crunchy and creamy a great appetizer overall! Right when we finished our appetizers our lunch arrived.   Everything was fresh and to temperature when it came to our table. The serving sizes of both dishes were more than enough for two people. My pho was great! I ate the entire thing (barely.) The basil, sprouts and jalapeno peppers all were fresh and crunchy. I was very happy! My girlfriends pork soup was amazing as well! I would return and have that again. All the flavors were fantastic and everything cooked perfectly. There was too many noodles in the bowl, that's the only thing I could complain about.   Overall I would love to come back and try something else! The waitress was polite and checked on us a couple times. Only negative thing was she was eating while we were so I felt awkward trying to ask her for more water.   If you're ever on McKnight and craving some Vietnamese/ Thai food this is the place to go!",

The lean beef Pho was tasty and hearty, with a light broth.  The dish came with a fried spring roll and a nice side salad (with traditional dressing) that was tangy and bright.  We also shared a crab Rangoon appetizer.  They were small and served with the same dipping sauce (sweet chili) as the spring rolls.  Pleasant and attentive servers, along with a steaming bowl of soup made for a very comforting meal.",

The roasted garlic was an excellent touch. For our main course, my daughter ordered the ginger with chicken, my wife ordered the TGIF sushi roll and I had the roasted pork noodle soup. The ginger was very flavorful and had an assortment of very fresh vegetables. The sushi roll my wife ordered was quite flavorful and was quite a large portion. I really enjoyed the pork noodle soup. The first spoonful of broth had an incredible depth of flavor and you could tell that it was homemade.  The roasted pork was very tender and was cooked perfectly. Oftentimes it can get overcooked in soups and becomes tough. Not so in this soup.  There were plenty of noodles and the dumplings were a nice compliment to the soup. I think this was probably one of the best noodle soups I had outside of Asia. I cannot wait to go back and try some different things on the menu. I am sure I will not be disappointed!",

We both ordered Cherry Temples, (Sprite with cherry syrup and a cherry), which was the perfect summer pick-me-up! I ordered the crispy duck noodle soup and my friend ordered shrimp Hawaiian fried rice, and both entrees were delicious! The food was very hot and fresh, everything was presented simply but prettily, and the flavours were perfect! Nothing was too spicy or bland. The crispy duck noodle soup was bright with a fresh taste, and the duck practically melted in my mouth, so good! After dinner we had the fried ice cream which was also incredibly good. I will definitely be going back again! If I had one criticism, it would be the logo... it's a bit hard to spot on a sign from any distance, so you kind of have to know what you're looking for in order to avoid having to turn around twice (McKnight is a divided road for anyone who might not know). Anyway, try this place out, if you like Asian/Fusion type food you'll love these guys!",
