Shelly's pizza is every bit as excellent as Vinny's, plus they have an expanded menu, and BYOB.  Vinny's has no corkage policy and doesn't permit you to bring in wine even if you offer to pay a fee.  My wife wanted a pizza party at home for some friends and Shelly's was more than accommodating having 6 pies ready at specific time with relatively short notice...all the guests raved about the pizza.  This is my go-to place for pizza in the area.",

Shelly is making pies that are even better. The dough is AMAZING.    I started with stuffed banana peppers and garlic knots. This would have be enough! Very big portions.  I also has a medium pizza - I  planed on leftovers. Out standing. I got an all vegetable pie. Everything was great.   There is also a full - and I mean full -  menu, but make sure you try the pizza!",

    "text": "We had eaten here before in the restaurant and had always been very happy. This time we booked their party room for our daughters graduation party. We could not have been any more happy with our choice, from the location to the food to the staff!  Mike (one of the owners) was nothing but patient with my daughter and I as we completed the details several days prior. The food was exactly what we had come to expect from Shelly Pie. When we walked in to complete the decorating on the day of the party, the staff had everything setup, right down to the water on the tables and the real silverware wrapped and in place. Every detail was completed and waiting for us.  Once I had a moment to settle in, I realized that Mike and Jim (one of the other owners) were in the kitchen, along with their staff, eyes deep in the prep. Once our party was started, Jim was constantly checking with his wait staff, making sure they had what they needed so that we had what we were expecting. The waitresses were outstanding, always on top of the details, yet never \"in the way\".  Again, I want to thank everyone from Shelly Pie! We received nothing but great comments about your food and service from our guests and my wife and I will recommend you folks every chance we can!",

This is almost as important as the food and I think these people understand that!! So many restaurants need to take a lesson!!  Keep it up SHELLY PIE!!   I would just like to mention that. I grew up going to Vincent's Pizza Park. It was like no other pizza, that is a fact.... As others have noted, it was sad when they closed. We all waited as they worked in the building and finally reopened. The pizza was BACK!! I have been there about 5 times since it reopened. It was good. BUT I FOUND SHELLEY PIE and I prefer it over Vincent's. I found it while I was driving past the former VFW where Shelly Pie is and I saw someone walking out with a pizza wrapped in butcher block paper on cardboard.... I quickly looked it up and had to try it!!! We get it once a week!!",

If you order pepperoni and like your pizza to actually taste like a giant piece of pepperoni and upon completion of the pizza wish to turn into a pepperoni, then order it.  If you are so/so on pepperoni, do not order it.  Most people probably wouldn't complain about too much pep - but this place puts WAY too much on their pizza.  There is never enough cheese on the pie. The crust appears to be super thick, but it's just the outer ring of the pie... in the middle, it's always incredibly way too thin that it's impossible to eat by hand. Certainly try for yourself... I believe it's one of those acquired taste type of pizza. You can tell this is a relation to Vincents pizza.  Not much of a difference.",

It's nice that it's hand-tossed so the crust is irregular -- some of the pie has a thin crust while other slices have a nice wide crust.  I also got my favorite: a well-done oven-baked Italian hoagie.  The hoagie could have been left in the oven for a few minutes longer but the flavor was terrific.  It was also nice to be waited on by Carly -- Shelly's niece.  What an interesting, friendly and nice young gal.  Thanks for the great food and the great service !!",

One of pizzas brought to the table, for someone in our party, arrived burnt and felt that it should have been comped as they had to wait quite a while for their replacement pizza after everyone else in our group was well tucked into their own food.  Appetizers were great too especially the zucchini and also  broccoli cheese bites. (The marinara sauce is wonderful).  Have been to Shelly pies many times ...love the food... but my biggest gripe is the parking lot... So please, please, pretty please Shelly Pies do something about your awful parking lot.

    "text": "My friend insisted on ordering from Shelly Pie saying it was the best pizza around. I have to say that this pizza just was not to my liking. It was very greasy, the dough was uneven, but I loved all the cheese. Some people swear by this place though, I just am not one of them.  The dough was extremely thick on the edges which I enjoyed, but it just fell apart in the middle where the dough was paper thin. The pools of grease gathered over the paper thin center making it fall apart even more.      Unless I'm in a bowling alley I do not expect my pizza to be that greasy. Any time you have to clean the top of the pizza with multiple paper towels, you can't help but be skeptical of the pizza quality. But again that cheese was the closest thing to a redeeming quality that I could find. Liberally spread across the surface it was cheese heaven, although it started to harden up quicker than most.  The other thing I didn't like particularly, granted it is minor, was the shape of the pie. It isn't really circular or particularly close to it. Maybe some people like the very long shape of the pie, my friend thought it made it unique. To me it looked lazy, although me not liking the pizza was probably a factor in that opinion.   I really did want to like this Pizza as I really love supporting small local businesses, but I will not be ordering from Shelly Pie again. A lot of people really love it and I hear the building is the old VFW and looks very nice. I wish the best to Shelly Pie but you won't find me there any time soon.",

    "text": "Usually very good but this place is hit or miss with the freshness of their dough. Two out of Six times I have gotten a bad pie to the point where I though I was going to chip a tooth on the crust. Anyone who ever worked in a pizza place can tell when dough is not fresh or over proofed. Sometimes it dries out on top and creates a pudding skin type effect on the raw dough. They roll it out anyway and think that by putting the hard pieces on bottom that it will change when cooked. It does change to the point of having little oyster cracker shaped hard bits all over the bottom of your pie. One time they were as hard as pieces of eggshell.  In my opinion this is not satisfactory when you are play 12 plus dollars for some bread and cheese. The last one I got had an over proofed crust made out of old dough and did not taste anything like what it normally does. I will give it another try but I hope someone who works there reads this and makes some changes and addresses these problems. If it keeps happening I am going to have to start going to Vincents.",

I thought I would give it a try again. I ordered a pie to be lightly done. When I got it even the cheese had burn marks. So I called and they said they would make another. Had to make a trip back down to pick up the re-make. I saw a pie that came out that looked good. So I thought mine would look that way also, big mistake. But it was better than the one I took back but not by much. They didn't offer anything for the incondenience but an apology. My sister doesn't complain but her's ways even worst than mine. In fact the crust was hard and the cheese was even burnt more than mine. I know it will be a long time if ever I go back.",

I needed to to feed 10-12 people and ordered 3 large pies.  I was not aware that they did not put the pies in boxes, rather they just staples paper onto cardboard.  It was quite the challenge to transport.  Nevertheless, I managed to get to my meeting and a few people asked if this was from another shop up the street.  I told them no, it's Shelly Pie.  The pies were fantastic, bacon and pepperoni on one, black olive and green peppers on the second, and white pizza with tomato and ricotta.  I cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "So I grew up as you can say cutting my pizza teeth on Vincent's in Forest Hills.  Being so fortunate was both a blessing and a curse as no pizza can live up to the lofty standards set by the Vinnie Pie Master and Creator himself.    As I grew older I learned to quite frankly not like pizza because none of it ever was as good as a Vinnie Pie. As I moved through life and my 20s and now into my 30s I have gotten to a point where I can tolerate most pizza and even kind of like Chicago staples like Geno's East but still none can hold a pie cutter to Vincent's.   As the issues at Vincent's came about and closure it was a sad day in my life and I can say many other Vincent Pizza Park fans.  Then magically Shelly Pie signs appeared at the old VFW in Turtle Creek and after opening we decided to try it  ... HOLY SMOKES did they knock it out of the park here.   Its like they took took a Vinnie Pie, fine tuned the process, and came out with WHAM the best pizza ever!  Crisper crust, high quality ingredients, clean experience and you have the finest pizza in the land.  Even after Vincent's has reopened I find myself dialing the Shelly Pie number instead.   While my heart will always belong to Vincent's, Shelly Pie has my taste buds.",

Today I feel compelled to highlight the excellent service I received today at Shelly Pie. This being my first visit after hearing good thing, I was greeted as if I was a regular. I was guided into the right pizza choice (they didn't let me order a large) by two pleasant ladies. Before I even got my food I was sold and knew I would return. I am a regular, and frequent other \"local\" establishments that many Pittsburghers will claim as their favorite pizza place, but sometimes at these \"other\" establishments they treat like you're just another order placed. I look forward to Shelly Pie growing to be in the conversation of Best Pizza in the Burgh....",

We also had the zucchini, which was also quite good.  Dinners:  I had the chicken piccata and it was really good - enough to feed two people, easily.  Hubs had the tuna noodle casserole, which he declared wonderful and could not finish.  Friends ordered the antipasto to share and were super happy - it looked great.  They also had the Italian hoagie - the bread had a lovely crunch on the outside and a soft inside.  We didn't ask if they bake their own bread, but speculated that they did...    Now for the star of the evening:  Calzone.  I mean CALZONE!  It was big; a beautiful work of edible art.  Easily enough for three people.  Golden brown and Friends confirmed: as beautiful on the inside as it was on the outside!  We left with bags of future lunches.  Service was attentive, quick and engaging.  It was a perfect end to a perfect weekend.  Thanks Shelly Pie!",

Let me also be clear that I've never met Shelly and this is in no way a reflection of the woman.   But, oh that pie...  This is the kind of pie you come across late at night and can't believe she's from your town. That's probably because she's not the perfect beauty that everyone shares on their Facebook page. There is nothing about her that conforms with society's normal conventions of beauty. But she is gorgeous, and irresistible. You get a glance of this voluptuous goddess and catch one whiff of her sweet/savory scent and are instantly in love. Or lust? I never can tell.   You take her home and there's just so much to her that you wonder how you can handle it. There's no way you can just dig in without making a huge gooey mess. The discipline to go get a fork and knife and a plate are necessary, but you can't wait... You cannot help but dive right in. And it's everything you've imagined that it could be. It's so damn messy, but the flavor dripping down your chin is heaven and you no longer have the ability to care about how dirty you get.     After finishing that first piece, you shouldn't go back for more. But you do, because you can't help yourself--- and you keep going back until you physically are unable to take another bite.   Now, here's the great thing: your Shelly Pie be there tomorrow! Oh, you won't start off the day with a slice. No, you're too good for that. You'll decide to be the good little scout and choose something a little more \"nutritious.\" Something that you won't be ashamed to be seen with if your family drops in unexpectedly.   But she's still there, and all day you can't stop thinking about her.   So later that night, when you can't control yourself any longer, you call to her and she's instantly there for you: in all her heavy, tasty, thick, luscious decadence. Within minutes, she's hot and steamy, you light headed and hungry, and it begins all over again. Just like the night before when you brought her home; you can't get enough, you go back for more and more until you're so ecstatic and fulfilled that you pass out in a love-drunk haze thinking of nothing but Shelly Pie.  **************************************************  Post-Script:  Life is beautiful. Life is sweet. But the laws of physics say that what goes up, must come down and likewise the calendar says that work week eventually comes back around. You valiantly go about your business with only limited daydreaming of your crazy weekend.   The clock spins 'round, it's dark and you've done your time.  So you get out the door, it's late Monday night, and then it hits you in the face like Sonny Liston wearing brass knuckles:   Shelly Pie closes at 10 PM!    You'll be going home alone.   But that's ok. Because if you had Shelly Pie every day, you'd be dead within a year.",

Looked like a municipal building on the outside, but the inside is well maintained and comfortable! Only downfall was finding it, and passing it twice before realizing where the parking was (to the right in a side lot, turn at the light after the pizza place). Handicap accessible ramp in the front, tables are a good wheelchair height. Bathrooms are handicap accessible with locking door and bars, so it's very wheelchair friendly.

We had the pizza buffet with appetizers (hot banana peppers and wings).  It was absolutely delicious and there was plenty of food for all of our guests.   They used nice plates and silverware and really made it nice  for us.  Our friends and family who have not been here raved about how great the pizza was!  Our waitress, Gina, was very efficient, sweet, and accommodating.  When preparing for the party, Shelly and the other owners were kind and accommodating.  I would highly recommend Shelly Pie's Restaurant for a party or just to go get a pizza!  Thanks for everything, Shelly, Gina and the Shelly Pie team!  Gina Rudolph",

When we drive into Turtle creek and saw the building that it was in (old VFW building)..I was skeptical... But went inside and the place was really nice... And really busy.... Ordered the pizza as everyone said how good it is.... I've got you say...i was impressed! Got pepperoni and sausage... It was loaded up! The sausage was definitely the best sausage ice ever had on a pizza! It was oily pizza....i think they drizzle olive oil over top of it... Didn't think i would like that, but i didn't mind it at all. They must use a light olive oil. Co workers also ordered fries... Garlic parm.... Should've seen the size of it! Was enough fries for four or five people. Will definitely be back to Shelly pie",

    "text": "After being raised on the rival Vinnie Pie since the early 1980s, and seeing it wane recently, I was all but happy to make the trip to Turtle Creek to try a Shelly Pie. To say it was good would be an understatement. This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh!! No topping skimping, and they're fresh...you can't even see the crust underneath all of the toppings. The small pizza can easily feed 3 people. Shelly is really nice, and the rest if the staff is really friendly, too. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the decor has local WWII memorabilia around the restaurant. You can get other food besides pizza there, but I didn't try it...yet. I recommend Shelly Pie to anyone looking for something completely different from lame-o chain pizzas. Parking lot there, and maybe even on, or right next to, the busline. Takes credit/debit cards and cash.   Word of advice: if you intend to take it home, line your car seats or trunk with a garbage bag...there is some grease from the cheese and meats, and these pizzas come wrapped in paper on top of a slab of cardboard.",

I have heard people say this area is the mecca of pizza, where good pizza comes from etc. Now although NJ will always hold a special place in my heart...pizza from nj nyc is straight DOO DOO compared to Pittsburgh. I thought i knew what good pizza was, until i moved to Pittsburgh. I went on a small pizza mission when I first moved here trying all the local pizza spots and let me tell you.. Pizza in Pittsburgh blew my pants off. The pizza at Shelley Pie is so big, its like a monster pizza ate all the other weaker pizzas and formed a giant super pizza dripping with a hundred pounds of cheese mad toppings and love. The pizzas here are so gigantic if you tried to lift the pizza it would collapse in the center.  I went into a pizza/carb coma after attempting to eat Shelley Pie and it was totes worth it.",

For the second time in a row, received poor service - this time in terms of food delivery, the time before it took forever to get the bill - and ended up walking out. How hard can it be for a pizza shop to make two pizzas for a table and deliver them together? But no...let's space them 20+ minutes apart, so the first is cold before the second comes. Being polite requires one to wait so all can eat, but it's apparently more important for the staff to sit around a table talking and counting tips (witnessed) than getting food delivered correctly. Then you can grab a wrapped pizza that's been sitting on the shelf, take the paper off, and try to pass it off to your customer. Frustrating.  I think I'll go back to Vincents...Shelly will get my business no more.",

    "text": "This pizza creation is quintessential Pittsburgh. A perfect representation of the creativity from the hard working blue collar east coasters.   If you've never eaten at Shelly pie or Vincent's, you're doing yourself a great injustice by going else where in my humble opinion of both establishments.  Now with that being said, you will find the odd yinzer, who will tell you to avoid this pizza . . . I got into that argument at a cousins house just a few weekends ago. He said it was too greasy and \"soupy\" hard to eat Etc Etc...    And my response was simple. If you can have enough self control to let the pizza cool down for about 5 min or so, it gets much easier to dish out and cut.. I know that is an incredibly hard thing to do, because the sight of one in front of you is just too exciting, and you wanna dive right in. But just like with any good pizza, you will most likely end up with a little grease or cheese drippings on you , so maybe wear an old T-shirt or something, no one cares its very casual and laid back   I love Shelly pie. I live over an hour away, but will make the trek into turtle creek again in the very near future for my Pittsburgh classic . Gotta wash it  \"Dahn\" with some turners iced tea too! Perfect!!!",

    "text": "Ok, I admit it, I'm late to the game in trying Shelly Pie. I'm a diehard old fan of the Vinnie pie, and had my first pizza at Vincent's Pizza Park several decades ago. Fast forward to 2017. Vincent, god rest his soul, is gone. Vincent's Pizza Park is pretty darned good but not quite the same, and now we've heard that upstart Shelly Pie has been operating for a few years down the street with a competitive product. This demands an investigation. Well I did my due diligence. I visited Shelly pie and ordered a pizza, and even brought the leftover home for a midnight snack, breakfast and lunch the next day. I proudly proclaim Shelly Pie as the second best pizza ever to grace the Three Rivers region, the first being the late Vincent Chianese. Ok, Vinny's gone, so the mantle goes to -ta da-, Shelly Pie. With Vincent's Pizza Park closely behind.  Shelly Pie's pizza isn't quite perfect - yet - but it's darned good. The decor is far nicer than Vincent's (remember the fake plastic grapes and lights hanging from the ceiling in the old VPP? Can you say fire hazard?), but minus 2 points for a small imbalance in the salt in the crust. I don't like a lot of salt but even I felt that it came up short in that department, a bit bland. But the sausage was awesome! Rich sausage taste, punctuated with hot pepper and fennel... Mmmm. And Shelly Pie has the same great \"sauce\" on the pizza pan rendered from the sausage and veggies you choose, and you WILL dip crust pieces in this sauce and eat them or you're never coming back. THUMBS UP, Shelly Pie, you folks ROCK, and I will be back and next time I will bring my friends!",

    "text": "So the family and I were in the car trying to figure out where to eat and my wife says Let's try Shelly Pie. So we made our way there. I had heard a lot about this once VFW hall turned Pizza restaurant so we were excited to see what all the hype was about. Upon arriving the parking lot confused me as you have to enter of the street in the rear.  As we walked in I was pleasant surprised as the space is open and very modern compared to the building's exterior.  I must say that this placed reminded me of Gateway Grill and Rivertowne Pour House in Monroeville. It was pretty loud too. They do have several flat screen TVs to catch a game though.    Once inside we seated ourselves and were greeted by Patty. She was very funny as we told her it was our first time there. A couple minutes later our waitress Sara C came and took our drink orders.   For our appetizer we went with the fried Zucchini Planks. You get six to an order and they come with either ranch dressing or marinara sauce. They were very, very good.  For our entrees my wife and I both went with ShellZones (Shelly's version of the calzone) For topping my wife got pepperoni, cappicola ham, banana peppers and mushrooms and I got steak, bacon and mushrooms. Our daughter got the 1/2 pound angus burger with American cheese, grilled onions, bacon, lettuce and tomato with a side of fries. Looking at other meals being served while we were waited for ours I must say that their portions are pretty huge for the price.  Our daughters burger arrived first so she dug in. I did try a couple of her fries and I must say they were very good.  A few minutes later our calzones came, but mine was wrong. Mine came filled with steak, mushrooms and banana peppers instead of being filled with what I had ordered. I had our waitress take it back and have a corrected calzone made. Not to mention they gave me my same marinara sauce that came with the first calzone and by then it was ice cold so I had to flag the waitress down to bring me fresh and hot marinara sauce.   By the time my corrected calzone and hot marinara sauce came my wife and daughter were done and pretty much ready to go so I only ate a couple of small pieces and had the rest wrapped to go. What I did taste was delicious though.   It wasn't our waitresses fault as she took down the right calzone toppings as it was notated correctly on our check when we paid. She did take the drinks off our bill which was better than nothing....",

Vincent's is closed on Mondays, so I thought I would try a Shelly Pie because a few friends and family said it was better than Vincent's. Apparently, the owner worked at Vincent's. It's not the worst pizza I have ever had but it's definitely not as good as Vincent's. I can't put my finger on whether it was the sauce, crust , cheese, or pepperoni but it was no Vincent's. It just was not a good pizza.  I have never amended a review before but felt the need after the owners comment. Yes, I compared you to Vincent's for three reasons.  1. Those that recommended Shelly Pie told me it was better than Vincent's. False in my opinion.  2. If you don't want to be compared to Vincent's.....stop trying to look like Vincent's! You wrap your take -out pizza in the EXACT same way except you use brown paper and Vincent's uses white.  3. Stop making your pizza look like Vincent's!  See the photos I attached.  I am a big supporter of Mom & Pop places, however that does not mean I give special treatment when writing reviews. If I have a bad experience or dislike the product, I will absolutely give a bad review and if it warrants compare to a place I like. Seriously, everyone in Pittsburgh calls Vincent's a \" Vinnie Pie\" and your place is Shelly Pie. If you think comparisons are not being made, you are out of touch with your customer base.",

    "text": "This place has great reviews and I wanted to see what the hype was all about! Upon arrival, the parking lot was somewhat difficult to locate. It looks like you can drive into the back of the bank next door to access the lot or there's a one-car driveway on the side of Sally's. We ordered pick-up and the order was ready upon arrival. The cashier who helped me was really funny (wish I remembered his name!) The pizza was wrapped in a brown wrap with a cardboard base, no big bulky boxes.  First let me say this pizza was HUGE. The two of us didn't even eat half of it. A small would have been a better option. The taste was okay, not the best pizza but not the worst. The bottom of the pizza was a little soggy, but that may have been due to being a pickup order.  All in all, it was good pizza. The crust was thick, doughy and was easily my favorite part. For a three topping pizza it ended up being a little over $24....expensive in my opinion. Maybe next time I'll order a small or try something else on the menu.",

    "text": "Sorry Pittsburgh, your pizza is not good in general and Shelly Pie is part of that group. I know you will probably disagree or even dislike me for saying that, particularly if you've grown up around here. If you have something bad for long enough you'll eventually think it's good (think Stockholm syndrome). But back to Shelly Pie...a few things, in order from worst to less worse:  1) It is wrapped in brown paper instead of being served in a box (you know, like normal people would do). I know. Your family (shelly pie) has probably done this for years and I'm sure you have a million reasons why it's superior.  But.  It's not.  In fact, it's one of the worst ideas ever.  Not expecting this, I picked up this oddity of a pie wearing a brand new, white North face jacket. Upon arriving home I was surprised to find 3 nice splotches of pizza grease about 5\" in diameter on my clothes; 2 on my jacket, 1 on my jeans. The only reason I didnt give 1 star is because I was able to get the stains out, thank god. 2) If you order a topping, expect to get a pound or more of it on your pie. Hey, I hate when pizza makers are stingy with the toppings; that sucks. But just to eat a slice with what I would consider a normal amount of toppings, I (no lie) had to remove 75% of the amount of pepperoni that was on it. You can imagine how greasy this made the pie, probably contributing to issue #1 above, and rapidly increasing the onset of my future heart attack. 3) The cheese was nice & thick (normally a positive), but was tasteless and slid off the slices easily. I had to recook it at home just to get it to stay on. 4) Crust. My biggest gripe with Pittsburgh pizza is the crust. I just don't like it; the flavor, the fluffiness, etc. I'm a NY style girl; some Chicago deep dish as well.  Wish it was better, but not sure I would ever order this again.",

    "text": "BEWARE!!! Save yourself the trouble and order elsewhere. There are so many pizza places around.  We ordered Shelly Pie through Doordash on Sunday. A group of us were watching football and one decided to order a pizza for us to all go in on. Pizza is a regular thing for us and we have tried most in the area.  We ordered a large pizza, half with various meats and half with onions. With the toppings this pizza is expensive, so you expect it to be worth it.  The pizza arrived and we unwrapped it only to find that all the toppings were on the whole pizza. My friend called Shelly Pie about it and they said they had been having issues with Doordash. In my opinion if you are having issues either fix it or discontinue the service with them. He said he wasn't worried about that but simply how to rectify the situation. We had vegetarians in the group.  They said they could make a small pizza with onions which we could pick up in 20 minutes and we agreed. This defeated the purpose of Doordash since we were trying not to leave the house, but we agreed.  He returned with the small pizza and as I was unwrapping it he made a joke about there being meat. Unfortunately when I unwrapped it there was a pepperoni sitting right there. I don't know if someone thought they were being funny, in which case I do not appreciate the joke. Or perhaps someone was just being careless. Either way I will not be returning to Shelly Pie.  The pizza was not very good at all. That was a consensus. It had almost no sauce on it and was a little underdone. Plus the onions on top were an absolute joke. There was literally pieces of onion the size of my hand. That is simply called being lazy.  This was my second experience with Shelly Pie and this one was more disappointing than the first. It will be my last.",

Rumor has it that Shelly brought the recipe for the pizza dough from Vincent's, and although it has the same appetizingly chewy crust, it lacks the lightness of Vinnie's. Although there is \"an obscene\" amount of toppings on their enormous pizzas, they aren't cheesy/greasy like Mineo's. Even if you don't partake of the pies, if you leave hungry, you didn't do it right. A bowl of delicious Italian wedding soup and a tossed salad suffice to fill you up. I have no idea if Shelly's has a dessert menu, because I've never had enough room in my stomach to ever consider glancing at it, much less seriously contemplate ordering anything off of it. The staff are kept busy when the place is hopping, but they're always nice, so please tip them generously. Prices are eminently reasonable. Thanks, Shelly!",

I also loved the fact that there is an adequate amount of booths. The bathroom was also very clean. We came about 4 pm for dinner. The place was fairly empty and a server was over promptly after we sat. After looking at the menu i found it to be just a tad more expensive than I had expected. We ordered a large one topping. The pizza was 15 and the topping was 4. The pizza was a decently big size, lots of cheese and thick crusted. The pepperoni was a bit oily but overall okay. It reminded me alot of Vincent's pizza. My only complaint is the server wasn't too great with bringing refills.",

Might've liked the crust a bit crunchier, but it was still very fulfillingly yeasty. Surprisingly busy even at 3pm on a weekday, it seems to really be a local hangout (great accent-spotting), in a peculiar yet somehow charming location for an urbanite like me.  So, why not 5 stars? For all the hype surrounding this place, and the years of lore about Vinnie Pie, I was expecting the pizza to be a transformational sublime experience that would change my perception of what a pizza is. It was a good pizza, but it wasn't life-changing.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in the mood for trying pizza somewhere off the beaten path (at least for us), so after a quick search, we were on our way to Shelly Pie in Turtle Creek.  Shelly Pie is a sit-down pizza restaurant (though they also serve things other than pizza). It has a warm and welcoming vibe...most of the people there seemed to be locals. It was very clean, bright, and had lots of TVs. Our server couldn't have been nicer and was very attentive.  We opted to keep things very basic and ordered provolone sticks for an appetizer and a medium cheese pizza for dinner. The provolone sticks arrived in short order and were delicious....fried to perfection and appropriately gooey. The best part of the sticks was the marinara sauce they were served with....super flavorful! Most dipping sauces are bland and generic, but this actually had chunks of tomato and lots of visible spices. It was so good that we actually ate the rest with a spoon when we ran out of provolone sticks (don't judge).   After we were done with our appetizer, it took a REALLY long time for our pizza to come out. I mean....we're talking probably 45 minutes? Our waiter was really apologetic and kept saying....\"It should be out soon...how long could it possibly take to make a cheese pizza?!\" (Our thoughts exactly!) At one point he even offered to bring us out some bread to nosh on, which we declined since our appetizer had taken the edge off of our hunger, but we appreciated his concern. So the service was great! But hopefully 45 minutes for a cheese pizza is not the norm and we were just there when they were having an off night in the kitchen....because that's definitely too long to wait for something so simple!  When our pizza finally arrived, we eagerly dug in and weren't disappointed. The crust was thick and chewy....pretty unique from other Pittsburgh shops. They also go CRAZY on the cheese....it's super gooey and heavy, so you'll definitely want to sop up some of the extra grease with a napkin before digging in (or I guess maybe not, depending on your feelings about grease, haha). Overall, it was a really tasty pizza. My only complaint was that it was a little sparse on the sauce.....their sauce is delicious, and I found myself wishing the pizza had more to balance out the extra cheese and thick crust. However, that was easily solved by asking our waiter for some extra sauce on the side, which he happily brought. And next time I'll ask for the pizza to be extra saucy!   Long pizza wait time aside, we were very pleased with the food and service, so even though this isn't exactly around the corner from us, it's certainly worth making the drive again to partake in this deliciously unique pizza!",

    "text": "What a great new spot. Odd location, as you can throw a rock and hit three other pizza places. Follow your GPS, especially at night, as this place sits back off the road and the sign out front is not lit. Parking is on the right side of the building. We tried this spot on a Sunday evening when we just couldn't stand another chain pizza and heard this spot opened up. The \"pies\" are delicious, but let me start front the beginning.  After calling in our order for pick up (pepperoni & mushrooms w/ bacon on half) I circled the block a couple times not really trusting my GPS that this big dark building with one porch light and no signs could be where my pizza was. I parked and gave it a try. Sure enough, once about 10 ft from the door, I could make out the unlit sign. I walked in to many booths and a sign that stated to \"seat yourself.\" I wasn't eating there so I began to wander around looking for the counter/checkout. I found a small register at the end of a counter oddly forcing the line next to the patrons sitting at their booths. While I waited, a few customers came in the side door \"looking for some place called Shelly's Pies.\" I felt better that I was not the only lost soul. As I waited for my turn in line, I wondered what my total would be as my wife saw the menu and no total was discussed when she placed the order. Once helped, the total for a \"large\" 2.5 topping pizza was $22! I have to admit I was shocked to hear anything over 20 and was hoping for less... But wait! Please read on! I still had not actually seen my pizza... I was handed a pizza on flimsy cardboard wrapped and stapled in butcher paper. Not a welcome sit considering the distance back to my vehicle. You can imagine my thoughts once back in my car... 'This better be the best pizza I've ever had' and 'I know you're new, but too cheap for a real pizza box?' NOW, once I got home and my wife unwrapped the pizza... All became clear. They can't use a pizza box because it's too enormous! It would never fit in any pizza box I have ever seen. And the price was totally fair considering there was at least a pound of pepperoni on this pizza. The mushrooms where also plenty and the bacon was so sense you could barely see the other toppings below! This pizza would have easily fed 6-8 adults, maybe more!  All in all, we plan to return, and often. Next time for a \"small\" pizza. As a new business, they will work out the minor things quickly, like signage, parking, checkout placement, and the old patrons of the previous business at that location (VFW) coming in to \"check it out\" & \"shoot the breeze.\" Well done Shelly & team. Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "Excellent pizza!! This is the kind of pizza that I expect for $20. Not some chain pizza that is cheaply made and tastes like cardboard. This pizza is the real deal. This is the kind of pizza that you will need multiple napkins to eat! The dough is fresh. The sauce is perfect. The cheese is real and authentic. And the toppings are plentiful! I ordered a pepperoni pizza and this thing was LOADED with fresh sliced pepperoni. They definitely slice the pepperoni by hand because there were a few larger chunks on top of my pizza which made it that much better!!! I am a big eater and two to three pieces and I can't move. Worth every penny. Parking is confusing, as it is in the back of the restaurant. The location of the restaurant is also confusing if you have never been there or are not familiar with the area. The dining area is small and compact. But it is nice and clean. It is also BYOB which I love! I have seen people there with small coolers full of beer, bottles of wine, etc. The service is excellent. The people working there really strive to accommodate their customers and really put effort into making a quality pizza with quality ingredients. Even though I am about 45 minutes away, I will be back a few times a year when I get the craving for this pizza!",

I keep aluminum foil on hand, so the packaging which I find so much better than a big box works just fine for me!  I think this is my favorite pizza place.  It's a pick up or eat in type of place.  But to be honest, the pizza is so good I will go and pick it up at anytime!  Thanks Shelly for getting it right!!",

The greens and beans were so awesome the absolute best. I could have been satisfied but we ordered the pizza and the awesome review continues because it was incredibly good. The crust had a little crunch and the toppings were plentiful. The menu is wonderful it has just about everything on it from appetizers to full dinners.  The building is the old VFW in Turtle Creek and they remodeled with a fresh new look. This restaurant won't be the best kept secret for long. Oh and a bonus BYOB!  I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in on Saturday, June 8; and although the parking can be a bit 'challenging' behind the old VFW in Turtle Creek, where Shelly Pie is located, due to the ongoing bridgework right next door, this place is well worth the effort.  The decor is pretty simple, but is very clean, and we were greeted and seated right away, a big plus.  It wasn't very crowded, but it was pretty early on a Saturday afternoon, so that wasn't unexpected.  My wife and I both ordered off the specials menu - my wife getting what  I believe was a cajun chicken dish, and I got chicken and veggies over biscuits with gravy and mashed potatoes.  We also got the wedding soup, which was AMAZIING!  Too many place over-salt their soups, but Shelly's nailed it.  The entrees were great, too; and nothing was overpriced.  Service was excellent, without being cloying, and the waitress was very personable.  The pizzas we saw looked huge, and I believe that might be our next adventure on our next visit, which will be soon.  And although i didn't get to order one of their italian dishes, I did see a bowl of ravioli that looked suspiciously like a serving bowl that could serve a half dozen people.  We will definitely be back!",
