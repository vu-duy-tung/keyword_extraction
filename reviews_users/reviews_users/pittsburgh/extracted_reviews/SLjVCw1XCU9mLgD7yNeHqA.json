Delicious, crisp, perfectly fried coating and thick, white fish pieces--no \"fishy taste\" whatsoever! Very fresh tasting! I'm impressed! This will be my choice from now on! Everyone was satisfied with their burgers and grilled chicken salad as well! The fries were lukewarm and limp--but that fish made them tolerable! Our waitress was very courteous and efficient--very nice girl! Now, the reason I didn't give five stars? The \"hostess WITHOUT the mostess \"! Terrible personality, not friendly and welcoming as a hostess SHOULD be! We almost turned around and walked out. I tried being friendly and she just glared at us. You know her, the miserable one with the strawberry blond hair. Yeah, you need to lose her or lose customers. Other that her, great experience and great food. Apps are very overpriced, but we'll be back for the fish and burgers!",

Fiance hated the shredded lettuce on his cheeseburger, I was pretty happy with the blackened chicken sammy I had. $5 sam adams, little pricey considering it's nothing special. Fries are really yummy. If you are in a hurry in this area this is a decent choice.  Pretty decent salad options, too, if you are watching your diet.  My biggest complaint is that my table and menu were kinda sticky, which is par for the course at chain restaurants..",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. I've gone here after going horseback riding at Rolling Hills Ranch with a group of my friends. We always go here after riding because we go riding with empty bellies and KNOW we'll be full by the time we leave here. We get seated quickly and waiting wouldn't be a problem with the multiple televisions they have, including the one on the floor! The ambiance and decoration in this restaurant makes you feel like your at home and can see the history and originality of the place. I've tried three burgers, the Whiskey BBQ Burger, the Bacon Burger, and the Cheeseburger. I have ALWAYS had a little pink inside and they had an absolutely incredible taste! The bottomless fries are great, especially with their special seasoning mix right there on the table. I think their new metal container for them is very clever. The waitresses or waiters that we've gotten are usually very nice and friendly, and give us a great attitude and are patient when we are ordering. Though it does take some time for the food to come out, we always get drinks within a short period of time which gives us awhile for some light conversation around the table. I don't mind the food wait, I actually enjoy it. It gives you and your company more time to converse and find creative things to do while waiting. Lovely place to be, absolutely incredible food and great service. Will gladly come back, any day, any time, no matter how busy. This place is worth the wait.",

    "text": "Another fantastic visit to Red Robin. My recent trip was on Sunday July 12 at 2100  My wife and I walked in and were seated right away, at a booth in the bar area.  Our waitress, Jessica, was prompt with our drink orders and her overall service was fantastic.  My go to meal is the Tavern Double with a chocolate milkshake. The burger was warm and juicy and the fries were fresh from the fryer and salted to perfection. I decided to try the Thai Chili sauce with my fries. To me the taste resembles the Thai 'R' Cracker from Quaker Steak, if you like Thai 'R' Cracker give the Thai Chili sauce at Red Robin a try.  To finish the meal we ordered the Chocolate Fruffles. These are like eating a fudgy chocolate brownie in stick form. The sea salt dusted on the outside enhances the chocolate taste. I preferred the strawberry jam dipping sauce but my wife preferred the chocolate and we each had the whipped cream as our second favorite, but they are all good.  If you go to this location ask for Jessica, her service was fantastic.",

I usually get a veggie burger, knowing their more than likely Morningstar Farms brand and that's my gripe. Red Robin prides themselves on their burgers, toppings, cheeses, and buns. Why not take some of those gourmet burger chefs at corporate and come up with a flavorful meatless burger? I really mind spending 10 bucks on a Morningstar Farms burger that they nuke and toss on a bun.   Three stars for the Speckled Lemonade. Five stars for the quesadilla, it was my go to meal before going meatless.",

I think it made me sick a few times, but that is by no means abnormal for me when it comes to restaurant food, so I won't blame it on Red Robin. We received a gift card so we gave it a go yesterday. My husband chose the bacon cheeseburger and steak fries. I ventured to the new four cheese melt and added turkey to it. I also got steak fries. When the food came out we were shocked at how little food came out! My husband got maybe 10 fries, yes, I know they are bottomless, but bring out enough to fill the plate please! Although tasty, I was left wanting more food after eating my four cheese melt and fries. I got a Nana Nana Moo Moo shake to go and my husband got a vanilla shake-both delicious! I just hate being hungry a few hours after eating out. It's my special meal of the week and I like a lot of food!",

The \"endless\" fries were as good as when I had them at the Red Robin near South Hills Village months ago, but does anyone order seconds of these, ever?  The creamy, timidly tangy cole slaw also agreed with me.   Eh, I should have just gotten a burger. It's great that RR offers a diverse bill of fare, but the Banzai Burger Kay's mom munched on made me envious.  Perhaps it was the flour-dusted bun. Yeah, that always does it.   Then again, wrapping it in bakery tissue is a cool touch too.   Damn, I want one now.   P.S. What is it with chains these days and their fascination with kitschy framed posters?

We're finally done with this place and will not be coming back. One of our favorite things about Red Robin used to be the friendly, attentive wait staff. Perhaps it's just this location, but literally 90% of the servers we've had here have been very inattentive and occasionally downright rude. Very disappointing. Do better, Red Robin!",

And no, i did NOT memorize that list. . . I just C&P'ed from their website.  It's a favorite.  If you want a good burger with some imaginative toppings that you won't find just any ol' place, this is the place for you.  The drawback would be the steak fries, which are a little thicker, and not crispy (the way *I* like them) but some people look for that specifically.  I opt for the sweet potato fries instead and am wholly satisfied with my lunch.  Staff is friendly/helpful almost to a fault and the manager swings by at some point during every meal to make sure all is well.

    "text": "When I think of Red Robin I typically think about a chain family restaurant... My hubby and I came Saturday for an early dinner and there was a HUGE line of people waiting to speak to the hostess. I was initially going to turn around and say \"let's go somewhere else\" but then I remembered, \"hey, we're adults! Bring on the bar!\" Now, I would estimate there were about 20 or so people crammed at the entrance. We went to the bar area and it was half empty . And no kids (sorry for those with kids, but if you want quick service as a group of adults, head to the bar area).  The service was pretty good. The bartender got us our beers quickly (not a large selection, but as my husband says you don't go to Red Robin to get wasted... And if you do jump off a cliff).  My food was like any other food at the chain. Old reliable. I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger with no mayo and spicy ketchup. It was delicious.  I'm not sure what my husband ordered but his burger came overlooked but he ate it anyway because we didn't want to wait. His plate was all kinds of chopped up. They probably should've tossed it, but instead they served it to him.  Will we come back? Sure, but only if we can sit at the bar with no wait. Until next time, ole reliable Red Robin.",

I ordered a guacamole bacon burger.....there was less than a teaspoon of guacamole on the sandwich..... I asked for my burger to be cooked to a medium temperature....the burger was crispy and dry as a hockey puck..... My wife asked for a burger with no sauce.....just lettuce, cheese, burger and onion straws..... It came out with both mayonnaise and bar-b-que sauce..... She sent hers back..... She specifically asked the waitress for a burger, cheese, lettuce and onion straws..... Her burger came back with mayonnaise on it..... She took a napkin and wiped the mayo if her second burger..... With two other \"Gourmet Burger\" places in the area.....I won't be back to Red Robin....",

    "text": "Food:  4 out of 5 Stars Server:  1 out of 5 stars Cook:  3 out of 5 stars  Went here with 4 co-workers for lunch to try out their Tavern Burger Twosday Special.  The deal is that you buy one burger and 2 soft drinks and get a Tavern Burger free (or a $6.99 discount if you order a more expensive burger).    We were the VERY FIRST TABLE seated,  right at 11am as 2 of my coworkers had noon meetings.  We placed our orders at 11:05 and it wasn't until 11:30 that 2 baskets of fries hit our table.  They were quickly devoured.    At exactly 11:40 our burgers arrived and my 2 co-workers started to race to finish so they could get back to work.  3 of us had ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double which was supposed to have raw and deep fried jalapeno's on it.  They came with a small amount of 'bottomless fries' in each basket.  I had ordered some buffalo wing sauce to come with my fries but I wish I had ordered ranch.  Our waitress was no-where to be found.  A few times she popped over to other tables but at no time did she stop back over to see if everything was ok or if she could get us anything.  Are we supposed to use the 'table monsters' to get her attention?  I'd MUCH PREFER if she just stopped back to check in.  after I had eaten about half my burger I decided to look inside.  There were no deep fried jalapeno's.  Not in mine or the other 2 at my table.  After hailing the waitress and asking her about it- she had the manager come over with 3 tiny serving cups of peppers and said, \"Oh, sorry guys.  My cook forgot to put them on there.\"  We were the first table in there, his very first order of 5 EASY burgers and he can't even get them right?  I asked the manager for more fries for the table and a co-worker asked her for a refill on his sweet tea.  Right away she brought over fries then brought over an unsweetened tea.  When he said he wanted a Sweetened Tea she went back to the kitchen and had the waitress bring out the correct one.  Is THIS the way Red Robin does lunch?  When it came time to pay, the waitress seemed bothered that we didn't know how to use the 'table monster' and even more annoyed when 2 of us wanted to pay with cash.  This is how they get tipped, correct?  On SERVICE, correct?  I've had better service at York Chinese Buffet.",

My daughter and I had just finished at the movie theater that was about 100 feet or so away when she saw a red Robin she was like mom please can we go to red Robin I want to burger!  Back in my Bordo Gordo days I would have happily ate a big fat burger at this place unfortunately my review is going to be based on the cob salad it was actually pretty good I got a side of fries and had a bite of my daughters bacon burger which was delicious!  I kind of wish I had gotten one of those but I'm trying to watch my weight so I landed on the salad. The salad had bacon bits avocado grilled chicken and really fresh lettuce it actually tasted pretty good. I scraped the bacon to the side and had ranch dressing. It was really good, the waiter was really nice I actually ordered a side of fries and they didn't come out right away, when I asked him about it he apologized and said I was trying to wait until the food was ran because I didn't want to charge you for the fries. I thought that was really nice of him. The food came out pretty prompt and the restaurant was really clean. The service itself was really great as well our server was really nice very attentive ensured that our glasses were never empty.   I will be back and the next time I go I will definitely have the guacamole burger I used to have it all the time.",

It's one of my favorite places to go before or after catching a movie at the nearby Cinemark.  My only problem is that by the time I polish off half a stack of onion rings and whatever giant burger strikes my fancy, I'm nearly ready to explode by the time I finish chips and start eyeballing those grown-up milkshakes.",

When it showed up I actually questioned the waitress...\"if this is the BIG GHOST, how small is the regular one?!?!\"  It had about the same amount of meat as a McDonalds hamburger. I will say this though, the diet pepsi was REALLY GOOD. Never go there again. With $36 less in our pocket we left the place profoundly disappointed.",

It's got a grilled pineapple on it, and that makes it healthy--almost like a fruit cup.    I've always had pleasant service here and this is probably one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to if you need to eat out and you've got a picky kid with you.  In fact the last time I was here with my then 6 year old cousin, he ordered the chicken strips and then hugged the waitress and told her they were the best thing he had ever had to eat, ever.    While I haven't found Red Robin to be HUG THE WAITRESS good, these burgers are terribly good, and then they are made even better with the basket of endless fries.  The last time I was here I opted for the steamed broccoli as my side instead of the burger.  The burgers came out and I took one look at the broccoli, said, 'what was i thinking?\" and then immediately started to steal my friends fries.  Don't be me.  If you're eating at Red Robin your diet for that day is dashed.  Commit to sin, and enjoy yourself.",

Asking for crispy fries was an issue, received them barely cooked and she was irritated when they were sent back. We waited almost 40 minutes for a check because she assumed we were using the machine on the table...patty melt was well done when asked for pink and bread was soggy...not a great experience and as much as I like Red Robin, there are way too many other burger places around to be treated as an imposition by your server....if we don't return, it will be due to Elizabeth.",

So it ends up as a good choice most of the time if I am in the mood for a burger without needing to make it an event.  The prices are reasonable. You're looking at $13-$15 per adult if you get a soft drink. The kid's menu is on-par with most places and they are/we're running a $1.99 special on Wednesday with purchase of an adult meal.  The service can be hit or miss. There seems to be a decent amount of turnover, but most of the servers are above average.  The quality of the food aligns with the prices, which is a good thing, in my opinion. You aren't getting a burger from a steakhouse, but it's definitely better than the average fast food burger  Overall, if you're looking for a reasonably good burger in a family-friendly environment than this place will check the box.",

We were seated immediately at a small booth. Both the hostess and our server, Ashlee, were really friendly. Ashlee was also efficient, getting our orders down and our food out quickly.   I'd been to other Red Robin locations before so there weren't many surprises; the food was tasty but nothing too remarkable. There is a wide variety of burgers, and a small number of options if you want to reduce your caloric intake or want a non-burger entree. I was able to get pineapple slices on my cheeseburger for just $0.49 extra, which was nice. My coworker got the BLTA croissant with aioli dip for $0.75 extra. If you have a big appetite, the bottomless fries are a bonus.  Our total bill came out to be just over $28 after tax and 20% tip (no desserts or drinks). We were able to pay using the pin pad at the table. I had the receipt emailed and it took several minutes to come through, but I did get it eventually. The restaurant was pretty clean and there was a family restroom in addition to men's and ladies' rooms. There was plenty of seating.  Overall, a decent place to get a tasty, if average, meal. There was abundant parking in the shopping center in which the restaurant is located.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with the most recent time I visited Red Robin. There were multiple moments that made it an unpleasant visit. My boyfriend and I came on weeknight, when it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress had three tables in her section that were occupied. It took about 15 minutes for her to even come get our drink orders. It seemed to take unusually long for our food to come out. When I finally received my wrap, it was actually a completely different burger. The waitress blamed it on the chef, but I wasn't sure what the actual miscommunication was there. I had to wait even longer to get the meal that I ordered. It appeared that our food had been sitting there for a while because my boyfriend's fries were cold. The most shocking part was the display of finished plates, empty glasses, and other silverware that was piling up on a table in the middle of our section. It made a very clean restaurant look messy. I'm extremely disappointed with my visit and hope that the next time I return it is higher than these 2 stars.",

Go elsewhere for takeout. Eat in if in the mood for their burgers.",

My girlfriend and I went here after a movie, the restuarant was barely occupied but it still took 15 minutes to be seated, they had this poor busboy busing, running food, and hosting. Once we were seated our waitress took another 15 minutes to touch our table then 10 minutes to get our drinks. In the over an hour we were at the table our waitress barely stopped by. Once we got our food my girlfriends burger was the order for another table when they brought her burger it had brown sugar on it and was over cooked. As if this wasn't bad enough my burger was undercooked and almost raw in some places. If I could give zero stars I would.",

It arrived after waiting for 30 minutes and it was black and hard as a rock. Completely burnt and inedible. They remade the burger. I waited another 15-20 minutes and it arrived not burnt this time but without bacon. My husband asked for water twice before we got it. We asked for more sweet potato fries and received regular fries. Lastly, no adjustment was made to my check or even a visit from the manager. I used to be a restaurant manager and in this case I would have visited the table and removed the price of the burger from the check. Goodbye, Red Robin.",

The only thing is the wait. If you try coming in on a Friday or Saturday night expect to wait at least a good 20 minutes to be seated, also the waiting area is not big enough for the volume of customers. But, Red Robin's itself are one of my favorite burger restaurant chains. Don't know if I'll be back any time soon to this particular restaurant but I enjoyed myself.",
