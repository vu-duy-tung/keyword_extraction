    "text": "I would give this place a 2.5 but you can't give half stars.. so two it is. Pretty nice bar/restaurant. Their pepperoni rolls were great with the garlic ranch (must try). My husband got the fire in the hole chicken sandwich which he loved, and I got the Buffalo wrap with BBQ sauce instead of Buffalo. Also very good! The reason for the review of 2 is because we ordered the pepperoni rolls as soon as we put our drink orders in, but they came out with our food. I specifically asked for no tomato on my wrap (twice), and my husband did too, except I got stuck with tomatoes- which made my plate watery from the tomato juice. I sent my order back because I was so adamant about no tomatoes that I wasn't going to ruin my meal over picking them off. After getting my wrap back- I only had a wrap- my fries were gone and I was not given any more. The first few I had while waiting for the waitress to come back and check on the table were good- but can't believe they took my fries back.... really? Topping it off was getting a box and the waitress swooped up the plate with the last pepperoni roll on it (which was going in the box) before we could notice- bye pepperoni roll... overall if you want good food but expect a little disappointment even when asking to have things correct- this is your spot.",

Sure, there are tons of chain restaurants in this area, but why would anyone what to go there when you could visit this family run bar/restaurant that is sure to please. Living in NYC now, this reminded me of my home town. I got there about 5pm on a Friday thinking I'd beat the happy hour crowd. Boy was I wrong! There was no seats left at the bar and there was only one bar table left (I didn't want to sit in the restaurant area). Service was great, food came quickly and the burger was delicious. People watching was great with patrons from 8 to 80.The Friday fish fry brings out the locals for both eat in and takeout. The only downside is the parking lot which is a bit small area in an oddly shaped strip mall.",

The food, especially the garlic, spinach, and pepperoni rolls are quite tasty. I'm looking foward to the weather warming back up so we can enjoy the outdoor bar more. They have bands play, I think, a few nights a week.   One word of caution: I don't think the same service levels can be expected for the tables. I have seen people looking anxious and twice we've seen people just move to the bar after a few minutes of no servers showing up.",

I absolutely enjoyed my conversation with the folks at the bar and the bar tender and the food was pretty good to..all in all, comfortable environment, great food and a busy patio with a pool table makes this joint a must visit if your in the area",

I like it when bars have DJs instead of the radio on. The DJ also offered karaoke, and it was super fun watching brave people belt out familiar tunes.",

Pizza, wings, Italian hoagie are all great.   Only complaint is their dining area. Seating is very limited. Also, you have to walk through the bar area to get to the dining room. Not ideal atmosphere for the little ones.",

I've only been 3 times, but each time the food has been top notch Italian, large portions, good drinks, great prices, and nice place to watch the games.   First game of trivia I've ever won so this spot has a special place in my heart. There is a restaurant portion and a bar that are totally separated... the restaurant is more family/private/ quiet/ friends/ trivia-zone environment while the bar area is- well a bar area!   The theme is definitely more rustic and is very clean. Service is good, portions are big, and quality pizza and pizza rolls(i love the spinach/mozza rolls) the rolls are honestly a 5/5. Pizza is a 4/5, I ordered a seafood and veggie pizza on different occasions. Let's just say the veggie pizza took about 45 mins and I wasn't even mad, you can't rush quality bro... even if it takes too long!",

Not a bad thing, just a clarification. They were only servicing the late night menu, so I grabbed a beer (ok, two) while I waited and ordered a Hot Italian sandwich to go. The bartender was super friendly and had a great personality. Once I got back in the car, I cracked upon the sandwich box to take a bite.  Sweet Mother. What a sandwich. The combination of spicy meats, Italian peppers and Provolone cheese pressed into the bread (panini-style, but not really a panini per se) created one of the best sandwich experiences I've ever eaten. It was that good. If it hadn't been so late and I hadn't been so tired, I would've gone back inside for another sandwich.  I'm only giving the place four stars since I feel like I need more experiences to justify the additional star, but I can't wait to go back and try it again. Well done, Downey's. Well done.",

Repeated attempts to grab the attention of both servers in the non bar area and the bus boy and any other employee were ignored. I'd understand if the place was busy-even if it was half full!  But, there were 3 other occupied tables in my half of the place-the remaining 8 were vacant.  I tried to stop at the bar to let them know or talk to a manager, but got ignored there, too. I travel all over the country and have yet to experience this amount of disinterest from a team.  Very frustrated and off to find someplace else for an even later meal before heading to my hotel.",

I especially love having a few beers and ordering the buffalo chicken dip or the pepperoni rolls. The location of this place is also very central and a good meeting spot for all of my friends.

We missed the prime rib and band by a couple of hours but will work on that next time, well at least the prime rib, the band starts after my bed time.  Service was great and super friendly, there was a separate dining area as well as booths and  high pub tables surrounding the bar. The dance floor was under some of those tables in front of the stage so I'm sure there's a little rearranging when the band get rocking...  All in all a great experience and would recommend to anyone looking for scratch made comfort food and a few cold ones to fill in an afternoon that flows into the evening entertainment...",

    "text": "Another first timer for us. I remember when this place was Gabby Joe's. It has a dining room and bar. The dining room is seperated enough from the bar that the noise isn't an issue.  Wednesday is .45 wing night and the wings were nice size pieces. The hot-honey sauce was good but I didn't really taste the honey. The mild were good as were the BBQ.  The hamburger was fantastic and the reuben was killer. Side slaws were very tasty also.  They have an extensive menu consisting of grilled cheese to veal parm and lots of appetizers from zucchini to pepperoni rolls which are homemade and supposedly to die for.  I can't wait to return again and attack something else on the menu.",

Awesome pepperoni rolls, pizza, fish sandwiches, appetizers....and the wedding soup is theeee very best I have ever had.

I know you have to give good tips and I do. Here's a tip to all servers Please do not hurry your tables out that is so rude and they make you do that because that's how you make your tips the more people you wait on.

Only bad thing I have to say is that they advertise that the full menu is available till 10:00 on several nights of the week, but I have come in at 9:40, full menu in no longer available, 9:45, not available, 9:50 and not available, etc.  And this is when there is a full bar of people usually.  I think the kitchen staff is always trying to clean up early so they can leave early, but they probably lose significant revenue due to this.  You can start cleaning up, but you should not turn down customer orders.  They should not say the full menu is available till 10:00 when in reality, it's not.  Wonder if the owners know that this is happening?!  ...all the time.",

I don't know if I'd believe it is light, but maybe compared to the other dishes.  But it was delicious.  The picture doesn't look like it, but it was a large portion.  The server was fun and she checked on us often.  Lots of nice tvs for sports and fun music was playing the entire time.",

The Italian rolls with Marinara sauce and the spinach with marinara and garlic ranch. Everything tasted great and the garlic ranch topped it all off.

Nestled away from busy Robinson and all the chain restaurants, this local joint has a lot to offer from great tasting food and specials, drinks, and a lively, but homey, atmosphere.   This was my second return here and I came in a group of 6 people. We were comfortably seated on the section aside from the bar. We had a great waitress who was friendly, courteous, and quick to service all of our needs.   The food were ordered ranged from the meatball sub, buffalo chicken wrap, to the tuna salad sandwich. We were all satisfied and liked the favor of our food. There's one thing I do remember from the first time I visited here, the pepperoni rolls. Save yourself the regret not ordering, and order them! Get them with the garlic ranch, it's seriously the bomb!   Lastly, one of the reasons why this place is so great is because of the reasonable prices of the food. For 6 people, under $80 not including tip. That should make any family happy. :-)",

You'd never find this place unless you were looking for it. It's on the drive up to a strip mall. But find it we did. We walk in and are greeted by a large bar and a sign that invites us to seat ourselves.   Our server is there promptly. Hubby loves a good IPA and wanted to know what was on tap. She gave him a few selections and then physically went behind the bar to make sure she didn't miss any.   Hubby orders the veal parm, which is a steal at $16.  He loved it. I, of course, went for the pepperoni rolls.   Folks, when I say these things were to die for, i mean it. They are these perfect rolls of light, airy pizza dough, pepperoni, and cheese which are then baked to a beautiful crispness. Pair or with the garlic ranch. I don't even like ranch, but I could easily drink this sauce.   I will come here every single time I come to Pittsburgh. These pepperoni rolls are that good.",

Our waitress got our drinks and order quickly, but once our meals were delivered she didn't come back to see if we needed anything. We ended up having to flag her down to come over as we needed dressing and napkins. It also took awhile to get our bill following our meal. The food was good (I had the Reuben), and I understand that they were busy! I would try them again!",

This restaurant serves traditional American dishes. Regarding Italian roll, the taste was addictive, especially with garlic source. Impressive!  Second, size of dishes were enough for us (2 adults and 8 years old boy)as a dinner. However, it was really reasonable price. Salad and rolls were around $11 each. Prime rib was around $24.  Finally, staff were so friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. Loudy, but comfortable enviroment. Old, but clean.  Totally, I would like to give 5 stars to this restaurant. We hope to be back to this restaurant again.",

Get those darn pepperoni rolls--you won't regret it!!! The spinach ones are equally delicious! Their salads are nice and fresh, as is the entrees. They have daily specials and their fish on Friday is very good! One downfall--the waitress we had was very friendly--but very forgetful. I had to ask FOUR times for lemon for my drink. FOUR! Then she neglected to refill my beverage although she was refilling all six others in our party. I kindly asked her again could I please get a refill of my diet cola...she was very apologetic...then brought me a regular instead. I don't think this was intentional because I was very nice and not snotty or condescending with my requests...she just seemed \"ditzy\". Other than that--this was a nice evening with my family and every visit is always a good one!",

    "text": "A little history: I come from a town of pepperoni roll fanatics. A town where each pizza shop has their own version of the \"roni roll\" and every citizen takes a hard stand on which pizza shop does it best. In high school I ate a pepperoni roll every day for lunch. So you can say that pepperoni rolls literally shaped me into the woman I am today.   With that being said, Downey's has the best roni rolls I've ever tasted. Hands down, the debate is over. I've never tasted a better cheese, dough, pepperoni combo in my life. Hand-made dough is rolled and cut into perfectly sized portions and then toasted so that the cheese melts and spills out just a little bit. The pepperoni was very flavorful and when paired with the garlic ranch dipping sauce, I swear I saw a glimpse of what heaven is like.   Drinks were reasonably priced, the service was good, and the atmosphere was great (we were there during a hockey game and the NFL draft. There are lots of T.V.'s) My husband's burger was okay, but nothing compared to my rolls.   We'll be back for sure!",

The host sat us in the outdoor seating area barely covered by a tent. It was POURING down rain and freezing! If you want to get to the bathroom, you have to go around the building to the inside, and some of that area wasn't covered, so we had to run to try and not get wet. They still had live entertainment and you could barely hold a conversation because of it. The service was very slow, and it was a weekday night with barely any customers. It must have taken an hour for any of our food to come out, including appetizers. Also, the beers we ordered were luke warm. A dish that was highly recommended was the pepperoni rolls. They are not worth it! Barely cooked or seasoned and it tastes worse than the frozen rolls you can buy anywhere. I only speak for myself, but this is one of the worst places I went to.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We were looking for a lunch place in Robinson whenever we found Downeys.  It's located right on Steubenville Pike and if you are like me then you have probably driven by it numerous times without ever knowing that it was there.  Whenever we arrived we saw a sign that said seat yourself and so we choose a high top table for 4.  Besides our table and others like it there was also a large square shaped bar and seats in this area along with a number of TVs.  After we were seated we realized that we were in the bar area and that there was also a dining area available.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the fire in the hole chicken sandwich with a side of celery and hummus.  I loved that they had a huge selection of sides that were both healthy like the hummus as well as unhealthy like the onion straws.  The menu described the sandwich as a chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese, bacon and jalepenos with a spicy siracha ranch.  Whenever our meals came out to us I quickly delved into the chicken sandwich.  The chicken inside was moist and I loved the addition of the bacon but I completely missed any of the spice of the sandwich.  While I know that a ton of spice isn't for everyone, if you are going to name a sandwich \"fire in the hole\", you should probably bring some heat.  As for the side of hummus, it came with celery and was overflowing its cup.  It ended up being an ok hummus but I don't know that it's a hummus I would have bought in the store as it was pretty bland.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  While the food here wasn't bad, it really let me down on spice and seasoning which is a shame since I was pretty excited about this meal.",

Directly across from the Courtyard Marriott you have a mall with all of the chain restaurants you would expect, PF Changs ect. I prefer something more local and real, Downey's hit the spot. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive, friendly and attractive. They have a good selection of beer. I ordered the pan fried veal with salad and a side of pasta. A solid portion, the food was fresh and good. After my meal I walked around a little and discovered they have a huge outdoor bar behind the place that was packed with 20, 30 & 40 somethings enjoying the great weather, corn hole games and music. It was a really fun atmosphere and it was great being outside having a few drinks. If your looking for good food, a upbeat staff and a fun atmosphere the Downy's House is the place. I know why the locals love this place so much, now I do too. I will be back!",
