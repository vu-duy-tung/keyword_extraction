The staff is friendly and correct. In particular my waiter was. He was Eastern European and I forgot his name but super friendly. The place is just depressing, at least during lunch when I was there. There were maybe a 2-3 other tables taken, the vegetable buffet looked just sad and gray and the meat that was coming out was really minimum which I understand you do as a business when there are no clients. Overall I only liked the filet mignon., everything was over cooked. This place needs more customers so it can survive. It has great potential but it's just strange to sit alone in a huge restaurant and getting much less variety of meat as they have in other places who are busy.",

A few friends ordered a pineapple mint lemonade which I was told tasted like straight pineapple juice and they ran out of mint. We had to ask for more plantains/bread/potatoes. Meat stopped coming around after about 30 mins. That was about 9pm and they don't close until 10 so I don't know why they stopped...we had to ask to have more brought around. The salad bar is really disappointing. Interior is nice and more upscale than other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. And finally, after being instructed to park in their Oliver garage since they validate parking we were told they ran out of tickets. Overall was it was a bit of a flop, womp womp",

The manager and his very accommodating staff make every effort to insure you have a good time.  They do change up the menu with seasonal dishes to mix things up for repeat customers.  The carrot ginger soup and pork belly and pineapple were delicious  additions for summer.  The staff is amazing.  As other reviewers have said, if there is a certain meat you want to try they will make sure to get it to your table as soon as possible.  Can't decide between two bottles of wine?  Let's get you two samples to try before you select.  Of course this is probably limited to wines they sell by the glass.  $49.99 for the Total Experience is a fair price for all that is included.  With access to the wonderful market table, meat selection, and sides brought to your table, it is a great value.  Of course, there are more economical choices if you are not a big eater.  Fogo is a great place to visit in a small or large group.  Go hungry, take your time and enjoy a great meal.",

    "text": "I made a reservation over a week in advance because we were going for a special occasion, and upon arrive, shortly before the reservation time we were told there was going to be a significant wait and that they did not know when we could be seated. We ended up being seated 30-40min after our reservation. I understand that tables sometimes just sit around but, 30-40 is way too long to keep a reservation waiting.   During the wait we headed to the bar, and were told we couldn't stand in the only space we could find, and the bar tender did not offer to get us drinks at that point. We moved to another area, and waiting at least ten minutes to be served. The bar was not overly busy for the three bartenders that were working. We finally got our drinks about 5 minutes before being sat.   Once sat, our waiter was a little rude because we were confused about the different price options, he was hard to hear. I had only been to Brazilian steakhouses where you pay one price for everything, rather than different levels of options. And then when we selected the most expensive options (we wanted to try it all and were celebrating) he tried to talk us out of it because it did not include desert. I told him no thank you, we had desert waiting at home.   The food was good but the salad bar was severely under stocked for a busy night. Many of the cheese and salad options were just empty platters and I didn't see most of them restocked before we left.   All in all, this dinner was very disappointing. The men serving the food were wonderful and polite, however the waiters and bartenders were rude and inattentive. Although the salad bar was under stocked, I must say the meat selection tasted great. Although the food itself was good, we will not be returning based off of the service we received.",

In talking with my server I found that they have 17 different cuts of USDA choice chicken, lamb, pork and beef that is shipped in consistently, never frozen. The market table is huge with a variety of veggies, fruits, rice, beans, meats & cheeses, smoked salmon, etc. I was shocked to find the location is not only healthy but 99% gluten free.  The service and food were beyond impressive, I had no wait and was greeted with lots of smiles (we know that's not always common in Pittsburgh). If asked if you want to try a cocktail, you must! Best drinks I've had in awhile, the Brazilian caiperina was so tasty.  I will be bringing my very large family next time. It looked like they have multiple private & semi-private spaces to book that would be nice for a large group.",

Food and drinks were delivered more then timely and all the servers were very pleasant and attentive to our needs.  We started out with the Market Table buffet which has possibly the widest selection of food I have seen. The freshness and quality of all the items was impeccable. When it was time for the servers to arrive with the meat skewers to pick from, I could hardly keep up as there was such a large variety to pick from. As a meat lover I was in my element and tried pretty much every single one of them. The quality was outstanding. I have been to a few other Brazilian Steakhouses before, but Fogo de Chao in PGH easily beats them all.  The dessert they provided was again excellent and even though full form the dinner I could not resist and was glad I didn't . We will most definitely return here in the future and will recommend this restaurant to all my friends and acquaintances.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh Restaurant Week: Disaster is putting it lightly. Came early to the bar and they were not equipped to make drinks. Bartenders were frantic and grabbing things from various areas. It took over 20 minutes to order a drink. This is before we even sat down. Having a reservation, we checked in beforehand and then again at 6:30, our reservation time. They definitely were overwhelmed so I was being patient. We sat down closer to 6:55 and explained the restaurant deal...basically saved you $4 and got lousy dessert. The PRW special included the Brazilian cuts, not the Full Churrasco Experience (which was $49 regular price)   Again, we waited a very long time for the wait team (more on that later) to take or drink order before going to the market table/buffet. And again longer for our wines to come. The buffet was actually good. Full of cured meats, cheeses, salads, fruits, veggies, soup and bread.  The meats were slow to start once we turned out cards to green, but once they did, they all were pretty good. The servers always were nice, asked how we wanted the cut prepared and the meats were all hot and delicious. I do want to note that we were not offered a clean dinner plate and instead were forced to use the dirty buffet plate...I went up to grab a few clean ones from the buffet table.  Dessert options included a chocolate mousse, key lime or lemon pie and maybe one other choice. The chocolate mousse was in fact dry chocolate cake.   The wait staff seemed very overwhelmed. Our main waiter never came over to ask if we wanted a specific meat server to come over. No clean plates. Just wanted ya in and out. In addition, it seemed like it was a team atmosphere. One server introduced themselves and brought water. Another took our drink orders and brought the wine. Another brought dessert and tried to give us checks, only until the first server came back to ask about checks and then eventually got them.   Overall, Green Forest offers the same (maybe even better) meats but also more options and the wait staff is far superior. I even remember Texas de Brazil to be better. The food is decently tasty but the service was not good. I would pass on this and choose another one of the Pittsburgh Brazilian steakhouses.",

Our expectations were very high, as been having a fabulous previous experience at Texas de Brazil.   The service was great. Everyone was extremely nice and professional, and I never had a glass of water below the halfway mark. The meat that came around was good. Our favorite was the house special, however it was very salty. I did notice that after the first few rounds the meats were just repeating, so in my opinion the selection of meat wasn't as broad as I had expected. The market table (or unlimited buffet where you get most of your side dishes) was good. I don't think it was as extensive as Texas de Brazil. There are mostly cold things (veggies, meats, cheeses, potato salad), but there are some warm dishes such as rice and beans. The servers bring mashed potatoes and plantains to your table.   Overall, I must say everything was delicious. A first timer would definitely be awe'd. If you're looking to compare to other similar restaurants, you might be slightly disappointed.",

    "text": "So, this review is very disappointing to me, but I have to write it. Last year, I attended a Yelp Elite event here and it was amazing! The food was great, drinks were delicious, and service was amazing! I was telling my fiance how great of an experience it was and he said he wanted to check it out. Fast forward to New Year's day. We made a reservation and when we got there, we were seated right away. A waitress came over and explained the experience and took our drink orders. We went to the salad bar and got some items- everything was stocked, however there was an employee who paced back and forth by the plates, so much so, that we actually almost bumped into each other while I was getting a plate. The whole evening she just stood at the salad bar. Not the best use of an employee, but this isn't my restaurant, so okay.  Another waiter brought over the Brazilian cheese bread and yet another waitress brought our drinks back. Once we turned our cards over to green, the men carrying the meats came over (frequently!) and offered different cuts of meat. Throughout our time here, different waitstaff came over to check on us. Our original waitress never came back over, so my fiance mentioned that they all must be working together as one team that shares the tips at the end of the night.  I would also like to add that other than the cheese bread, we did not receive any of the other sides that I was able to try at the Yelp Event... like the Yuka fries, bananas, and those delicious mashed potatoes.  So our bill comes out and we use the gift card we received from the Yelp Event, and then my fiance put the rest on his card. Once our bill came back, my fiance signed with the lower amount and we left a cash tip. He wrote 'cash tip' on the merchant copy and he accidentally left the customer copy on the table.  Fast forward to a few days later and he notices that his card was charged a completely different amount from what the original bill was and the bill after the gift card... he was billed $21 more than the lower amount. I called to inquire what happened and someone took my information and said a manager would call me back later that day. I didn't receive a call that day, so I called back the next day and asked to speak directly to a manager. I spoke with a manager and after about an hour, he figured out that a $21 tip was added onto the 'customer copy.' I informed him that we wrote cash tip on the merchant copy (and he acknowledged that he has that copy too) so I asked how $21 got written in, when we left it blank. He said that our check number looked like another one that night... and to be honest, I wasn't listening to the rest of the explanation because all I could think about was... is it customary for the employees to write in their own tip amounts on peoples' checks!? The manager said he would put the $21 back into my fiance's account and send us a gift card. But, that whole experience left such a sour taste in my mouth. I was very disappointed by the whole experience. I did give fogo one star because the food I tried was all pretty good.",

The staff right from when you walk in the door until you leave again are top notch. They are all attentive to whatever you need. The food was amazing we tried everyone of the meats and oh my can I tell you the mashed potatoes at the table, Pure comfort food Yum. The salad bar was wonderful. You definitely need to do the full Churrasco Experience. We All Loved It !!",

    "text": "New hot Brazilian (steakhouse) in town. Chic, hip decor, good wine, and BBQ in the vein of the gaucho style all you can eat meateries. For the non meat lovers, they offer a popular Chilean sea bass or salmon option and a market table of fresh veggies, soups, cheeses, meats and smoked salmon that is worthy of a trip alone.   I think once you go once and eat everything and figure out your favorite meat to eat, the best value would be the Gaucho lunch with Meat selection or the Select Cuts for dinner. Both include the Market table. Parking is super convenient(the parking elevator literally lets you out right by the back entrance) and is free after four with validation during the week.   The restaurant felt a little too cool for me to break out my trusty iPhone to take some snaps, but I wanted to take some pictures of their beautiful market table. It is chock full of deliciousness.   It is not cheap and I can't imagine anyone eating there for lunch or dinner for less than $25-$75, esp. with a nice glass of wine (or two), but located in the old Sak's department store, it is a neat trip to see how well they repurposed the space.",

This was my first time at the Pittsburgh location, on a Sunday night, toward the end of the evening.  The atmosphere is far better than the crowded, uncomfortable, loud, and cramped Pittsburgh Texas de Brazil, and there are more and better options at the salad station.  I love that some of my favorites are available: roasted cauliflower, marinated mushrooms, asparagus spears (though they could use seasoning), chicken and potato salad.  The service was generally good, but with two strong sour notes: the indifferent, unsmiling hostess who made it difficult for us to obtain one of the many empty, more desirable tables that were available, and the staff dropping the ball after we finished our meal, keeping us waiting about a half hour for our check, ignoring us as they were focused on preparing for closing.  Even after a busser asked if we would like the check, we were kept waiting a lengthy period of time.  This meal was a bargain, $35, the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week price, including dessert.  This is the king of churrascaria restaurants.",

    "text": "There is something magical about a good slice of picanha. At Fogo De Chao, the staff knows the power of a great cut of meat. Firstly, you could go for the Market Table alone and fill up, and it would be a top notch culinary experience. There's smoked salmon, roasted garlic, caprese, peppered bacon, multiple grain salads, fresh fruit, pickled vegetables of all varieties, and so much more. I've never ordered an entree here. Because Fogo De Chao is really all about the Churasco experience. If you've ever dreamed of sharply dressed waiters flocking to you with an endless cornucopia of fine meats, this option is a dream come True.  As previously mentioned, I'm all about that picanha life... But bacon-wrapped chicken, pork, lamb, and filet mignon are also floating around like delicious meat angels. Let's revisit  the Market Table for a second: it's like a Salad Bar, but an extremely grand salad bar. Besides the exquisite cold food offerings, there's also hot food... Including the most perfectly seasoned and prepared black beans you've ever had. Trust me! You want drinks? Fogo has a great selection of wines, plus a cocktail menu with a section featuring cachaca, a sweet spirit from Brazil. This spirit makes the drinks in that section of the menu VERY sweet (since cachaca is distilled sugar cane), but if you're the type of person who likes that, you've GOT to try one of these special cocktails.  Last but absolutely not least, the staff here are a team and work together very well to make sure you're attended to. I haven't had an unpleasant waitress or waiter here; They're all polite but also fun, and I felt at ease joking around with them on my few visits!  Please, at least once, go to Fogo De Chao. It is a memorable dining experience you won't regret!",

    "text": "I attended to soft opening for Fogo a few days before the opening. Despite this being one of their first run throughs, the staff were amazing and very professional.  The atmosphere is very relaxed yet upscale. Waiters are there at every turn and are prepared to assist you or provide information on a particular cut whenever you need it. They pulled my chair out for me every time I returned to the table and always had a fresh napkin or plate after trying different foods.  The food variety was excellent. If you have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you are in for a unique experience. The \"buffet\" was filled with a variety of vegetables, hors d'oeuvre, cold salads, cheeses, and cold cuts. There was also a hot bar with rice, beans, and maple bacon. The presentation was lovely and the wait staff are there to provide info and a fresh plate each time you went back for more.  As far as the meats go, they bring around several different kinds on large skewers and shave off pieces for you to try. This is where the red and green card comes into play. Turn it to green when you are ready, but be prepared to turn it back to red pretty quickly or you will find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of times staff will stop by to offer you another sample. Don't worry if you miss something once around. You can wait for them to come back, or simply ask your wait staff for them to bring it back again. This occurred at our table and once our staff realized we were seeking something specific, they had it out within minutes for us to enjoy.  Definitely come hungry and take your time! There is certainly no rush and trust me, you can fill up easily on the buffet alone!",

Believe me you could be very happy if this was all you were going to eat but be sure to save room for the meat because there's gonna be lots of it. It just keeps coming. I think they said that they were 17 varieties and having sampled about half they were all excellent. The antipasto bar had an incredible selection of everything you would expect and much more. Check look at a couple of pictures I snapped. Basically it's all you could eat for about 50 bucks, including all the meat. They had a decent wine selection and a full liquor bar. I would definitely go back here and would highly recommend it.",

The soup was great, the food on the buffet was constantly refreshed, and who doesn't love all you can eat charcuterie!!  Docking a star because the service needs some fine tuning.  We were there in their second day open, and you could tell the staff were overly anxious to have good customer service.  Unfortunately, it was incredibly annoying.  My party could barely finish a sentence before a staff member was checking in, taking out plates, cleaning the table, asking if we want dessert, every time we turned around someone was hovering at our table.  After our waiter butted in to ask us very probing and personal questions, It got to the point where we basically had to ask them to leave us alone so we could have a conversation. Unbelievably awkward!!",

We had no issues with service at all. Service was great from every staff member.  The place is decorated very nicely.  Very modern but warm too.    We went for the restaurant week promotion not realizing that's for the lesser cuts of meat.  We all upgraded to the full experience at $15 more because we wanted to try the filet and lamp chops.   The meat came at a fast pace and the two highlights were the sausage and the bacon wrapped chicken.  Those were the o oh things i had seconds of.  The filet was good. Tender but didn't have much flavor.   They told us they only put sea salt on it, which is fine but it was a bit bland.   One reviewer mentioned being told something was leg of jaguar.  We must've had the same gaucho because he told us various crazy things the whole time.  We found him to be hilarious and I personally thought he was the best part of the whole experience.   One time he told us he was offering us endangered roadrunner and another time said Tasmanian devil. .   Good stuff. I hope they appreciate him.    The managers and other staff constantly check to make sure you have everything you need and will bring a specific meat out if you ask for it more often.   The market table was nothing special.  Smallish salad bar. The best thing on it was the roasted cauliflower.  The dressings were standard and the veggies were all good and fresh.   Some stuff looked picked over and dried out, even right when they opened at 5 which was very strange (the salami and cheese section had a few shriveled ends of things. We didn't touch any of it). They had a bunch of interesting peppers though and everyone loved the bread at the bar rather than the cheese rolls at the table.     The sides:  they bring you mashed potatoes, bananas, polenta sticks, and cheese rolls.  Most of these sides went untouched.  The mashed potatoes were excellent though!    The busier it gets the slower the service gets.  I suggest going at 5 when no one else is there.  The market table was swamped at 630 when we were leaving but we had it to ourselves at 5.    Overall, I'm glad I tried it out. They validate parking in the garage that's on Oliver ave in their same building.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I attended Fogo as part of a food blogger event and my meal was comped but opinions are completely my own. While I'm not a huge meat eater I've always been interested in Fogo and was excited for the opportunity. There was an insane amount of meat, I seriously don't think I realized that many options existed! I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy almost all of the selections, particularly the filet and the lamb. I did not know how much I liked lamb but Fogo cooks it perfectly. The buffet should not be missed, especially the spicy bacon. It was a also nice to be able to add some veggies to my meal. Also highly recommend the polenta fries as a side dish for the table. I will definitely plan on going back on my own dime.",

The menu was very big. They have different type of all you can eat. Depends on if you are hungry for some premium meat or not. The fresh salad bar has overwhelmingly amount of options but still wish they have more fruit options. All the meat tasted great and I was super satisfied only wish I could eat more. The desert we had was chocolate cheese cake and key lime pie. They weren't the best.  They do validate your parking ticket if you park at the correct parking lot. It is very confusing, bu call ahead and confirm which lot is their designated lot. We parked at the wrong one, if you coming up from wood st, the first lot is not the right one!",

    "text": "My friends and I spontaneously came here during restaurant week not knowing what to expect, but ended up leaving with full stomachs and looking for an excuse to return soon!  As soon as we were seated (which was very promptly), a waitress came and explained the menu very politely. We ended up going with the Brazilian cuts, which included continuous service until we decided we were stuffed. There was also a self-service salad bar that included a variety of leady greens, cheeses, cold cuts, fruits, and other sides that make you feel slightly less guilty for indulging on endless cuts of meat. They also bring you bread and buttery mashed potatoes to your table.  As for the food that we actually paid for -- the Brazilian cuts were amazing! They definitely cook and season their beef the best. Picanha, sirloin, NY strip...all so delicious! I personally love my steak medium rare and my friend likes her beef rare, so we had no issues with the cuts. But if you like medium to medium well, you will have to specify so they can cut the right piece for you. They also had other meats including lamb, pork, and chicken. But I found that some of these cuts were slightly too salty for my taste.   Restaurant week came with a free dessert. So of course, since there were 3 of us, we ordered 3 different items. The original cheesecake was my absolute favorite. The slice is very tall and has no added toppings/flavors but it didn't need em! Very indulgent but not too heavy. We also had the chocolate mousse cake, which was very decadent. I love chocolate cake, but this one was a little too heavy. Tasted great, but I definitely couldn't finish a whole slice. Lastly, the key lime cheesecake was my least favorite of the 3, although it was still very good. The key lime flavor was refreshing, but I didn't particularly fall in love with the key lime syrup on top.  But what REALLY changed this review from 4 stars to 5 is the amazing service we received. Remember how I mentioned that my visit here was spontaneous? Thus, my friends and I entered in our street clothes, and were mortified when we saw that a lot of the other customers were very dressed up and professional looking. However, we were treated with the same kindness and respect as everyone else. Secondly, the staff who came around with the actual cuts of meat were so friendly and funny and even remembered which cuts we enjoyed and how we each liked them cooked! I also love how professional they were and how well they followed the system with the \"yes\" and \"no\" cards. When we turned our placecards to the red side (shown in picture), we were able to eat at our own pace and converse without any interruptions. But as soon as we turned the cards to the green side, everyone was very attentive and offered more cuts in a timely manner. Lastly - the thing that touched me most - was when we were paying. We came with a gift card provided at a Yelp elite event. When we paid, the register was having some trouble with the gift card. However, the manager did not question or doubt us once, and accepted the amount on the gift card in full. I felt so respected and grateful for such kindness that was beyond mere customer service!   If you're looking for a higher-end place to eat for a birthday celebration, graduation get-together, or if you're like us and are just looking for some high-quality meat, I highly suggest coming to this location. You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "It took me a lot of time to decide how many stars to leave for our visit.  It was disastrous from beginning to end.  I don't have a real reason why I didn't do 1 star instead of 2.   Our visit to Fogo was rough.  To the point I don't believe any of us will go back.    1.  We had 7pm reservations.  I get that Friday nights are busy - but you had 25+ people waiting in the bar area to be seated.  I also respect that the way service goes - you can't always predict how long groups will stay.  But these sort of kinks should be worked out by now.  We were beginning to question whether we would stay for our reservation when we finally were called to sit at 7:40p.  2.  Almost immediately upon seating our waitress came and got our drink orders.  Finally!  Success - we thought.  Nope - we didn't get our drinks till almost 8:20p.  In regards to drinks - our other problem.  After we ordered our drinks - we never saw anyone again to get us more drinks.  There was 6 of us - we would have ordered multiple rounds - but no one came again.  To get water - we had to ask those serving meat to bring it.  We never saw our waitress (at our table) again.    3.  When you go to Texas De Brazil - you get all the meats.  Everything is one price.  But at Fogo if you want lamb chops, prime rib, filet - you have to pay more.  I get that those are more expensive cuts of meat and respect their decision to charge extra - but was disappointed to find out you had to pay more for a \"different experience\".  4.  This is just a personal opinion and is not reflected on how many stars i left.  But - I was not a fan of their seasoning.  I had a few coughing fits - and needed water.  Again - this is just my personal opinion.  All of this being said - I don't see a reason to go back to Fogo.  I had RSVP'ed for the Yelp event at Fogo - and have since cancelled my reservation because I don't need to experience that mess again.  I left quite disappointed and I don't foresee myself going back.",

    "text": "Of course this is a well known chain with all you can eat cuts of meat but it's such a scam. My husband and I went for what we hoped would be a nice romantic \"feast\" and when we arrived it looked like there were people corralled into the restaurant. It was brightly lit with tons of tables and much louder than I had expected. The atmosphere was NOT romantic at all. It looked like a fancy cafeteria the way everyone was jammed in there. The restaurant was packed and luckily we had made reservations so we only waited about 15 minutes. There is a bar with salads and things you can pick at. It's kept very clean but they had run out of cheeses and a few things. They were running low on the lettuce. I feel like it could've been better maintained. Especially since they bank on the fact you'll fill up on \"non meat\" options to keep the prices down. Most people opt for the \"Fogo experience\" which advertises all sorts of cuts. We literally had them bring chicken around 3 times, bottom sirloin 3 times, and we had to ask for filet and ribeye which came at the very end. I was annoyed I needed to request it. There were about 10 different cuts and options advertised and I saw about half of them. They also sat us next to a service station and they reached over my husband for menus and water pitchers. It was definitely disappointing. I ordered a moscato and ended up with a Prosecco in an oversized wine glass because they had \"run out of flutes\". The staff was running around and asking the same questions because they work as a team. We were asked for drink orders twice and dessert orders twice by 4 different servers total. The mashed potatoes were good but cold. They brought a bacon wrapped steak that was beyond medium rare and inedible. The bread was cold. We ordered a molten and a creme brulee and it took at least 15 minutes for us to be informed they didn't have the latter. We will not be coming back.",

I've only been to one brazilian steakhouse before back in New York, and I'd say my experience at Fogo de Chao completely topped it. The all you can eat salad bar could be a meal in itself, with unique greens, vegetables and salad concoctions, including delectable fish options. But don't fill up just yet, because the best is yet to come. Skewer after skewer, the wait staff brought around different types of deliciously seasoned meat, with each subsequent offering better than the last. My personal favorite, filet mignon, cut like butter, and was absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend checking this place out!",

After you order your selected meats, you can go up to the food bar where cheeses and antipasto sides are displayed for the picking. This alone made me pretty full, as i didn't realize how much was going to be brought to us at the table. The meats just kept coming around. Non stop. All meats were cut at the table to your plate. However, what ever you do not finish, you may not take home. For the amount and quality of food served, i would say that the cost is reasonable, especially being a restaurant downtown. I'd also say to dress up and make it a date night or special occasion group dinner (they have a private dining room).",

Potatoes were cold and sent back and didnt get new till dessert was ordered.  Salad bar was well stocked and that part was good. Parking needs work - no valet option. It's a new location that needs to work out the kinks! Will try one more time in a few months with the hopes of improvement knowing that good locations do exist and have loved them in the past!",

I updated to one star because yes I went back and yes it was worse  We clearly had no waitress no bus person to remove dishes but we didn't even get plates we ate off tiny side dishes after asking numerous times for dinner plates  We received none of the things that came w the full meal no potato no rolls no polenta fries no fried plantains  No beverages  The meat was too salty to eat n they've gotten stingier with it and are not offering the better cuts  Awful experience",

    "text": "Went there for wedding anniversary and it was a mixed bag. The meats were all excellent. The young men and women who brought them were very attentive. One, especially, saved the night for us. You don't get an assigned waiter or waitress. They float. They don't have the logistics down yet because 75% of the way through dinner we still had NONE of the sides delivered nor the dipping sauces. When Daniel came by to offer us whatever delicious meat he had, he noticed this and went above and beyond to make sure we got all of it. He was not a waiter but he did a GREAT job putting the customer first and I commend him for it.  We were there for two hours and were checked on by a wait staff member ONCE... Until, of course, it was time to pay. Then they were REALLY attentive. Nice. If you want to eat beef eight ways and have lamb, chicken and pork, and you don't mind being totally ignored and experiencing BAD overall service, you might find it worth the fifty bucks a person.  Without Daniel, it was a sub-one-star experience. His efforts bumped it to two. Fifty bucks a person to be ignored and not receive everything the menu promises is NOT worth it to me.",

    "text": "Was able to try this restaurant and I can definitely say it is my favorite of all of the Brazilian steakhouses in Pittsburgh.  The staff was very accommodating when making a reservation and modifying the reservation to include more people.  And accommodating in providing bananas, uncooked for the babies at our table.  We were seated right away right in front of the window where all of the meat is cooking, so it was very entertaining.  The cold bar was quite large and had a very good variety of items on it that were all very tasty.  I had the strawberry hibiscus drink and it was delicious. I also ordered a Coke after that was finish and was pleasantly surprised that they had fountain drinks and I wasn't paying $5 for a 1cup glass bottle of Coke like some of the other restaurants serve.  The meats were all delicious, cooked perfectly, and not overly salty.  The only disappointing part was since we were right in front of the window we saw several meats that never made it by our table to try, despite being there over 2 hours.  I finally asked a server to send the parmesan pork my way so I could try it before I left.  The only area that was a bit lacking, and I will chalk up to being the opening week, was our server.  Several members of our party have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, but I had to prompt him to explain everything in detail even after he asked if this was our first time.  And overall he was just very slow.  It took a long time to get drinks, desserts, bills, etc.",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic restaurant that is sure to leave you full for a couple days after every visit! So far I've been to Fogo de Chao 3 times, the third being during Restaurant Week. Sure enough their restaurant week menu featured the Brazilian Cuts with a dessert at the end of your meal, and of course access to their market table whenever you want.   If you come to fogo, definitely do either the Brazilian Cuts or Churrasco experience. I have done both and after all the different options walking around, I didn't really miss out on the filet mignon or the lamb chops, which you get only with the Churrasco experience.   Some pro tips: 1) don't fill up on the rice and beans despite how delicious they are. 2) use the market table to your advantage, DEFINITELY get some mild/hot peppers along with some roasted garlic and pickles to cut through the fat on some of the meats. 3) pace yourself but don't pace yourself too slow, you'll have plenty of options walking around the room so don't wait too long and feel full before you've had a chance to at least sample everything. 4) I recommend the \"3 plate method\" one plate for your market table selection, another plate which you eat from, and a third smaller plate for chicken bones/anything else you don't want to eat.   Once you've battled your way through every meat possible, throw in the towel as you've fought a tough battle of willpower....and ask for the dessert menu. Their lava cake and papaya cream are absolutely delicious. I have yet to try their tres leches cake but it looks incredible - next time!",

Not average by any means. Smoked salmon, star fruit, candied bacon, and awesome homemade croutons.  Watch out for the bacon - it can be zesty!!!  The selection of meat that came around was good - the pork and bacon wrapped beef tenderloin was good.  Nothing was crazy good - but we got their \"basic\" offerings. It was $35:person special.  Staff was wonderful. Had a little trouble understanding some of the guys coming around with the meat.  Spoke really low. Felt a little embarrassing to have to keep asking them to speak up.  Dessert was included too. We had the cheesecake with chocolate drizzle and key lime pie.  Both were great.  Wouldn't do this often but I would go back. It was fun.",

    "text": "Food allergy/Gluten-free review:  I have been to other Fogo de Chao locations in the past, but it has been a few years since I have gone to this Brazilian Steakhouse chain. As other reviews have stated, this is a great option for a date night, special occasion, or when you're hankering for the meat sweats. It is a traditional Brazilian steakhouse where the entire meal is based around fresh-barbeque and roasted beef, pork, chicken, and lamb, as well as unlimited side options and fresh salad/market bar. I write most of my reviews based on the restaurant and staff's ability to accommodate gluten free and allergen free diners.   My favorites of the evening include the crispy polenta side and the Picanha (sirloin), which is the signature meat of the restaurant. I could have just eaten that all night. It's absolutely on par with other steak houses in the area.   This is one of the most gluten free diet-friendly chain restaurants I've ever been to. The unlimited sides, including Brazilian cheese bread (PAO DE QUEIJO), which are made with Yuca flour, crispy polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and carmelized bananas are all gluten free. All of the meat options are gluten free EXCEPT the chicken legs and chicken thighs, which are beer braised. The chicken breast wrapped in bacon is gluten free.   In addition to being gluten free, I also have many food allergies. I contacted the corporate office the day of my reservation and they promptly e-mailed me an allergen list for every item on their meat menu, sides, and market bar. I was pleased to see that many items were soy, egg, and milk free (all of which are common allergens). In addition to this, because I had let the restaurant know of my allergies ahead of time, the  the waitstaff was already alerted and took care of me the rest of the night.  Food allergies or not, I highly recommend this restaurant. Everything is cooked to perfection and absolutely worth the money. Save your appetite and feast away!",

I was told by a hostess via telephone that there were no seats available for the entire evening. I managed to reserve a table anyway through the Open Table app. Arrival was slightly off putting as I stood in front of the hostess counter waiting for staff to greet me but she instead greeted the people behind me who just came in the door. After making it to the table our waiter thoroughly explained the options and how everything work. He was marvelous. The salad bar was clean, well stocked, and I most likely could have been satisfied just eating that. Sadly our table never received any crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, or caramelized bananas which was kind of a bummer. The meats were continuous and well seasoned. I felt like there was a really good variety of things to choose from as well. For dessert I got the key lime pie which had a nice flavor but was lackluster due to the fact it was so warm. It must have been sitting out for a significant amount of time. We were completely finished with dessert and had our checks cashed out by another server whom we never saw the entire meal prior to paying. As we were getting out coats our waiter was like you didn't even have coffee yet?  I'm pretty sure I couldn't consume another thing at that point but it would have been nice to have that offered with our desserts.  Overall I would probably give this place another try at some point but I do feel there is some lacking in staff communication. The food is high quality and the atmosphere is wonderful but if the staff isn't working together to make the experience seamless  you end up with a mish-mash of mixed emotion guests.",

Don't forget the bacon. The quality of the ingredients/food was so superb and fresh. If you are not a big meat eater, i suggest this. However if you do the meats you get this anyways.  Now the meats, flip that coaster to \"yes please\" and be prepared for seasoned and rendered meats. Perfectly cooked to your liking. I been to steakhouses around the city and have to say this tops them by a mile. Also the service was great. They were very attentive, friendly and took care of you.

It would be a perfect spot for a quick lunch or a great dinner. Their bar is really nice and stocked with anything you would want. They also have some very unique wines to choose from for dinner. Whether you are a meat lover, vegetarian or pescatarian, this place has options for everyone. For the meat selections they have the classic red/green coin system for asking the server to bring more options over to your table.   Overall, the service and food were excellent. If you haven't tried this place yet, give it a shot. Parking is easy too. They have an attached garage in the rear of the building and also a parking garage diagonally across the street.  They are currently building some housing units above the building but that doesn't impact anything at all with the restaurant so don't be deterred by that aspect. Well worth a visit!",

    "text": "Another steakhouse has opened in the downtown area. Like we need more with at least 3 others down here already? However, since it is Brazilian inspired I decided to check it out.  I had a reservation made with open table and when I arrived at my scheduled time which was when they opened, I was told I had to wait 15 minutes because they weren't done setting up. The place had just opened for business and no one was there!  Have researched the business on the web I learned that the offer free parking in the Oliver Garage after 4 on weekdays and $10.00 parking in that same garage at lunch with validation. My visit was on a Sat and on Sats and Suns they serve brunch. The brunch includes their famous \"market table\" which to me seemed like a glorified salad bar with specialty items and behind it was a hot items which consisted of your usual breakfast fare (sausages,bacon, etc,) along with Brazilian made hot items to compliment it.  During brunch you cannot order Brazilian cuts or select cuts but if you want those meats then you would need to order the full churrasco experience. Your server would hand you a two sided card (green and red) that includes an opportunity to scratch off a code to enter online to win a trip to Brazil. Basically what happens is that servers will come to your table with long skewers of meat as long as you have the green side up and they will carve off the portion you select. Once you turn it over to red then they will stop coming to my table.  I finally had a nice waitress seat me and a wonderful lady named Rebecca wait on me. She was very attentive to my needs and appreciated all the help she gave me. I had noticed on the menu that they offer mango chilean sea bass as another option during brunch. I could have it ala carte or with the market table. Learning that the fish already comes with asparagus, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas with a Brazilian style lady lock, I figured that would be plenty for me.  She asked if I wanted to start with jumbo shrimp cocktail as an appetizer which I declined. That appetizer is way over $20.00 and is not listed on the menu. The restaurant has a full bar and a notable wine list which I also declined.  People have asked me \"why would I order fish in a Brazilian steakhouse?\" Simple, when you come as a group not everyone wants steak and I wanted to see for myself how their how their Brazilian style fish was.  All the tables are numbers which are for the server's convenience. Although this place appears elegant I did see a few people wearing T-shirts and jeans.  I was told I had to wait 15 minutes for my food but in the meantime she started me out with Brazilian cheese filled rolls. They are gluten free and did not come with any butter. I found them bland and wasn't impressed with them.  When I finally got my meal I found the fish moist, tender, and there were no bones. It was indeed an excellent choice. The asparagus which it sat on was cold so they promptly brought me out a replacement which was much better. The whipped potatoes came with a spoon and like she had told me,  the caramelized bananas were like a dessert unto themselves. They were very good and you can get refills if you want more. The lady lock was fair but I was really impressed with the fish and the other sides.  When I was finished she did give me a dessert menu. Desserts normally run close to $10.00 each. Rebecca recommended that I try the papaya and vanilla ice cream and they come and pour a liqueur over it since it was light. I went for it and a server poured the amount I desired over it. It is indeed light and had that melted taste to it, however, it was very good and not overly filling as I had hoped.   This place is very pricey and believe me you do get tons of meat with the churrasco experience. The market table extends on a long oval shaped ice bed with a vast selection of soups, vegetables, cheeses, charcuterie board, and some seafood to compliment your meal.   To me this place is a work in progress since they have recently opened. The decor is beautiful and very laid back. Families are welcome to eat here. Special pricing is given for children under 12.  Located in the building that once housed Saks it is conveniently located near pubic transportation. WiFi is available and they will graciously input the passcode into your mobile device.",

I do think the only reason they were ever even brought was because I went to the hostess stand to ask if she could check on them. The meats were fatty and way over cooked. I would never return here again. Overpriced with bad food and poor service. If you are looking for a good Brazilian Steakhouse then try Texas De Brazil.",

I particularly do not like the setting of the Brazilian style steak houses because you can not have an intimate or a business appointment there. Too many  interruptions and food is coming and going.  The place is   for  a family or friends get together but it is expensive and it is not good for kids. I was there for a business meet and I only started the conversation after we all ate. Of course they did not rush us. The cocktails were very good. The meat was really good and the bar with salads, fruits is tasty with a big variety. The also bring shares dishes on the table for sides. The place is clean with nice lighting and decor.  Out server was not very good but the rest of the staff was helpful. I would come back but not for business meeting.  Maybe for a girls night out.",

    "text": "Excellent service and delicious food. If you have been to Green Forest Churrascaria or Texas de Brazil, then you pretty much know how these Brazilian steakhouses work. They give you a round medallion, and when you turn the green side up, the roving server carrying meat on a skewer will stop at your table.    There's also a salad bar with lots of cheeses, salads, and sides. They bring you mashed potatoes, fried polenta and plantains to your table.  The wines by the glass run about $11 - $14, and the Argentine Malbec Alamos I tried was very good ($11 a bottle in the PA State Store).   Everything I sampled was delicious and piping hot. Servers were very attentive and helful.   Vegetarians will find plenty to eat at the salad bar.   The dining is upscale, so if you enjoy dressing up for a special evening, you will not feel out of place. Every customer I saw was dressed casually.",

We were immediately greeted by our server who had our table filled with water in mere moments. Within ten minutes upon our arrival, the delicious meats started circling our table, and didn't stop coming until you said you needed a break.   The chartreuse and salad options were nothing but the absolute best, and plentiful. There was imported hearts of palm, fresh roasted cauliflower with asparagus, marinated roasted red and yellow peppers, fresh fruit selections, several varieties of peppers, aged cheeses...this is to name but a few of your selections! You won't believe how delicious their bacon is unless you try it for yourself!   The variety of meat was exceptional with various options and cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, all seasoned to perfection. Everything was moist and delicious.  We felt like royalty with all the friendly staff constantly checking on us. Our glasses never were empty, and neither were our plates. If there was a particular meat you wanted, all you had to do was ask and within moments, your wish was fulfilled.   Your parking is complimentary if you park in the garage located above their restaurant. Although the prices may seem high for some, you are absolutely getting your money's worth for the quality and selection along with such experienced chefs and staff.  We have already made reservations for our next visit! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine dining experience.",

The gauchos: they were hilarious and attentive!  They'd joke with us about what type of meat they were serving every time they came by.    Most of the food: the garlic mashed potatoes, most of the meat, and most of the market table were great, very tasty!! Oh and the bacon was so good that we went back for seconds and thirds of it.  The bad:  The price: we  were  sold on going based on the restaurant month price of 35 dollars, but it actually didn't include the prime cuts of  meat, so it was the same price as it would have been without a coupon. They just don't tell you until you walk in the door. We ended up all doing 50 dollar dinners, which didn't include dessert.  Some of the meat: some came out rubbery and/or massively overcooked or raw. The ribs were extremely dry and tough.   Service slowed as the evening went on: at first, when we were one of a handful of people there, we couldn't keep up with the meat being brought to us. Later, we rarely had people coming to the table. Wasn't a  dealbreaker by then because we were getting full, but still.   Overall, we had a  great night and enjoyed the meal!",

    "text": "I've been to the location in Pittsburgh twice now and it's been great both times!!   It's really tempting to fill up on the salad bar/buffet because they have such  great selection of cured meats and cheeses (my favorite) but definitely make sure you save room for all of the carved meats.  The first time I went I tried just about everything (the chicken, pork, beef and lamb).  But I'm really there for the steak! So the second time I learned and passed on the chicken and pork and only had one piece of lamb so I could try all of the cuts of steak.    They are also very accommodating here.  My little brother doesn't eat steak so they made sure to come around frequently with the chicken and pork for him.  Also, if you really want to try a certain cut of beef, you can ask them and they will make sure they bring it out to you the next round.  That being said, I probably would not go here unless you eat meat.  I've seen some reviews complaining about a fish dish from here but I mean, its a STEAKhouse and they bring different meats to your table, so I'm sure that fish isn't really their specialty.    ALSO - even though by this point you are probably SO full, do NOT pass on dessert.  The Tres Leches Cake is AMAZING.  Overall, it's a nice place for a date and a fun experience for a family.  The food is great and the staff has always been really friendly and attentive.  I definitely recommend (as long as you eat meat!)",

The staff are very kind and made sure we always had enough shareable sides but I'd prefer Texas de Brazil any day. Make sure to only go on a busy weekend night or you'll only be offered 1/4 of the selection of meats. We had the same cut of meat come by the table so many times we weren't sure that they had anything else (which now makes sense why they made sure our sides were always fully stocked, they were probably trying to distract from the lack of meats) and drinks took an exceptionally long time to get to us for there only being 5 tables full in the restaurant. I ended up paying for the full experience but only ate off the salad bar due to the lack of meat options. Very disappointed, won't be back. Giving 3 stars mainly for the ambiance and staff friendliness.",

You could honestly come here as a vegan and still get a killer meal off the salad bar, I kid you not!  My favorite of the meats has got to be the lamb. I want all the lamb! I think there's maybe 3-4 different choices, which is shocking. They're just so tender and juicy. I can't even remember the other steaks I like, because I love the lamb so much. I keep my eye on the prize for the people walking around serving the lamb.   Like I said, the buffet is amazing. There's a candied bacon that I could swim in. I love all the veggies, cheeses and salads too. I fill up on hearts of palms like I'm never going to eat again. I think it makes me feel fancy. I also am a huge fan of the cheese bread served at every table. I'm gluten free and it's a naturally GF bread and DELICIOUS.   Seriously, pace yourself, there's a lot to eat here. Maybe just don't eat at all for the day until you come here, then dive in to all the meats and more!",

    "text": "First of all,  It looks and feels like money.   The look of the restaurant is ah-may-zing!  I have been to other Brazilian style steak houses and I have to say that the quality of the meats served elsewhere have been lacking or they had lackluster salad tables. (E.g., Cheaply made sausages with bits and pieces of off-tasting meat and flaccid salad offerings.  Yuck!)  I can honestly say that was NOT the case with Fogo de Chao.  All of the meats that we tried were high quality meats that were perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Chicken breast meat is EXTREMELY difficult to prepare on a large volume basis (It often comes out dry and similar to chicken flavored sawdust. )  The grilled chicken breast that I had was actually JUICY!  Literally, juice was oozing out of the meat as soon as I cut my portion.  The pork chops and lamb chops were next level and if I could have, I would have stashed several of those in my purse to gnaw on later.  They were just that good and flavorful.  Damn!  Damn! Damn!  I wish that had some now.  My lunch mate and I actually chewed on the bones to get the last bits of meat.  And that ribeye steak and some other beef cut that I had were sublime.    And that \"market table\" was no joke.  My lunch mate said that they would come back to Fogo just for that and the fejoada.  Top quality ingredients all around.  And our wait staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  Everything kept being refilled and plates swept away so quickly, it was like being in a Harry Potter movie.  It's a little pricey, but well worth it in my opinion, to just go ahead and get the full meat offering.  I will definitely go back.",

The meats all came out nice and tender! One of the employees came around and nicely asked if there was anything they could bring us (referring to the cuts of meat) and I responded with lamb chops which is one of My top liked items here. They did not have any ready but were very kind to put some on the grill for Me in which I did not mind waiting. One of our servers, \"Evan Russell,\" was very polite and nice to My Family and even offered up some great recommendations on how to experience \"Fogo de Chao.\" I think \"Evan\" would make a really great Manager because You can tell that He really knows his stuff. \"Fogo de Chao\" is really great for Birthdays! I used My $25 off B-Day reward and they still gave My Family a free Dessert as well in which they gave it to Me with a nice personalized touch!\" I ordered the \"Papaya Cream\" which is one of their featured desserts. It is light but very tasteful and I feel it was a great finishing touch to our meals! I will definitely be back at some point!!!",

    "text": "Recently I went here to attend a Yelp event.  True to their word, Fogo de Chao is all about the meats.  Our meal started with their salad bar which had a expansive array of foods including meats, cheeses, vegetables, breads and soups.  You could easily make a great meal just off the salad bar.  Once that was finished they began to bring around the meats.  A simple card system is used to order more meat - green for more, red to stop.  They have a great variety of meats and the ability to prepare it to your liking.  I usually don't like well-done steaks but had some pieces done over their open flame grill with a slight char that changed my mind a little.  The chicken and pork options were also excellent.  The servers were also very good and took the time to understand what you wanted and could go get it if they didn't have it out on the floor at the time.   I also enjoyed some of the drinks they had from the bar.  Specifically the Brazilian Gentleman, a bourbon with passion fruit drink served chilled.  One of the best bourbon cocktails I've had.  All in all I had a really great experience and think it's a great location for dining with friends.  Come hungry.",

I have to say I had an even better experience when I came back.   We started at the bar for some drinks before our reservation. The bartender was super friendly and the drinks were delicious. They have some decent drink and appetizer specials for happy hour.   I have to say this time around I was more impressed with the market table. I think with the large yelp group it was probably hard to keep it all stocked. It was much better this time and I can see why people rave about it. Even as someone who doesn't love eating meat that often I was very pleased with the meat. Multiple different options and everything was delicious! My coworkers and I will definitely be back very soon.",

I decided to take my family back to experience this place for themselves and upon attending the said Yelp event I was given a very generous $50 gift card to return.    I was so excited for them to try this place because of how great it was the first go around,   they just weren't that impressed and frankly neither was I.  It wasn't the food, the Gaucho chefs were phenomenal,  the food was great, our server was what killed it for us.  He appeared annoyed when we told him we wanted the restaurant month pricing, he muttered sh** under his breath every single time he approached our table. I'm really not sure why, we were all pleasant and did not complain about one single thing.    The bar was not quite stocked as it had been for the event that I went to this time around and I wanted my family to try the sweet, crispy,  delicious bacon... however we were there for an hour and a half and it wasn't restocked until right after we paid the bill.  My Brazilian cocktail that Jade (the super awesome bartender) made me the first time was just not so great this time.  Jade obviously did not make this one... anyway I will need a long break before returning to this place.",

    "text": "Service is slow, food is somewhat tired and there are not as many options as Texas de Brazil. Out of the Brazilian steakhouses in the Pittsburgh area, I have to say this one ranks last for me. It took maybe 15 minutes after a friend and I were seated till we got our water. There were not many meat options and halfway through our meal I grew bored. The best cuts of meat I tried were the lamb and chicken wrapped in bacon. I also had an issue with one servers, he seemed really obnoxious and kept putting the meats he cut in my vegetable plate when I had a whole separate plate with my other meats. I felt like he was doing it to rub it in my face. He also gave me meats I did not want to because he assumed since my male friend got some, I would too. I was not enthused by this service.   The cheese bread is not as fresh as Texas de Brazil. It was too hard and not cheesy or stretchy at all. The one redeeming quality of this place is that they had papaya in their appetizer buffet. It was so tasty, plump and sweet. The dessert I ordered was the papaya cream which was so rich and fresh tasting. It was topped with some Creme de cassis liquor which really satisfied me. Would I go here again? No. I only went here one other time when Fogo opened up one or two years ago. I remember thinking that the cheese bread was not as good and that I preferred Texas de Brazil more. I came back here because i wanted to give it another chance. I'm happy I did, because now I know not to come back here again for dinner. However, maybe for the papaya dessert. It was wonderful!!",

Yes, it's a chain and yes there are other places around like it (some chain and some local). I've been to them all. I can honestly say that this is the best. The food is fresh and tasty. The filet mignon is my absolute favorite. I also really, really love the dry aged steak. The fresh bar has so many choices that you can eat from that alone and be full. In fact, it's an offering they have for lunch which I plan to go back and do next time. I love the endless meat and the sides, cocktails, service, ambiance and overall vibe from Fogo.

First we visited the bar for caipirinha's and it took about 20 mins to be waited on. One drink took over an hour from arrival to payment. Then we proceeded to have dinner and my husband ordered the restaurant week special that was to come with dessert. Our server hardly visited our table and when it came time for dessert, they brought out cheesecake with nuts even though we ordered plain since we are both allergic to nuts. The servers claimed they were out of that kind even though the table next to us were just served it. When we asked what other options there were with no nuts, at first there were none. Then they told us they'd comp a different dessert off the regular menu. So we settled for a different dessert and ten mins later, the waiter came out and said he had nothing without nuts in it. Needless to say, we were now late to our show so we left without dessert. Overall, the staff had no clue what they were doing and it really showed. Sad to say I probably wouldnt go back to spend that amount of money!",

Then the main event began. Meat meat and more meat  you just keep that green sign up and it keeps on coming. Everything had  a different flavor to it and you could get it from well to medium rare . My only critique would be to cook the chicken a little less ,was a little dry. Then just after you think you can't eat any more. You order  the cheese cake such rich flavor I was beyond stuffed .        The Servers and Carvers  had such cool personalities and did a great job at keeping the food and drinks  coming .Definitely recommend coming down and trying this out.

    "text": "tl;dr: Lower your expectations. Serious front of house issues.  This visit was a special occasion for us, besides my birthday, this was also our first \"date night\" out together since we had our first child. We'd been looking forward to this special night out for many weeks.  For the first time this year we got dressed up, wore clothes without spit-up on them outside the house, and left the young one in the care of a babysitter.  We felt fortunate to find the ad for \"Restaurant Month\" at the new local Fogo, offering what seemed like an incredible deal of a $35 per-person dinner, a substantial discount.  We made 5:30 dinner reservations so we could see a nearby theater showing at 7:30. My wife and I have visited Fogo de Chao's other locations in the past, in Atlanta and Boston. Based on our always 5-star experiences at those locations, we came in with high expectations for quality of food and service. We left in a rush to our show, and disappointed. The Pittsburgh restaurant does not meet the standard we had expected.  Our problems were foreshadowed pretty much as soon as we entered and approached the host stand. The hostess was talking to a woman who was asking to speak to a manager. The hostess seemed frazzled and uncertain of who the manager even was. The woman left the restaurant without talking to anyone, agitated. We were seated soon after, with very little wait, at our reserved time.  The table we got was very near the front door, which turned out not to be the best spot to get.  Our water showed up promptly and took drink orders. When we mentioned the Restaurant Month promotion, he stopped us and made sure that we knew that the promotion didn't include the \"full Churrasco experience\", which basically means that instead of being offered the full selection of meats you can select only from the less pricey cuts. The waitstaff had pretty clearly been instructed to push the up-sell on the full experience to restaurant month diners pretty hard, because we heard this spiel a few times as tables were seated around us.  The price difference was $15 per person ($50, standard menu price), but because of the promotion they would throw in a free mini-dessert for us. This was a special occasion, and I wanted to try all the cuts (especially, notably the filet mignon), so like most of the other tables we heard, we threw the discount to the wind and ordered the full experience, along with a couple of drinks from the bar.  Staff was not ready when the 8-top next to us got seated shortly after the adjacent 2-top. As that table got their orders settled we didn't see our waiter for over 20 minutes. In the end, we didn't get the free dessert I had ordered because due to slow service we ran out of time before our show, having spent over 100 minutes at dinner, most of that time it was us waiting on them. We did leave with an apology to-go dessert in the form of a key lime pie, which we gave to the babysitter.  The server did indicate he would have given us a 20% discount on the check for our negative experience there, had we not cashed out at the same time we ordered the dessert, which we did due to the poor service, anticipating that we might have to quickly leave.  The helper server for our section was also having her own problems, with the sides (and clean plates, which are the norm when switching to meats) taking a long time to arrive after we had started eating, and the cheese bread not arriving at all, until we demanded it after more than 15 minutes into the main meal. In fact, none of the tables around us received cheese bread at all.  The worst part of the experience was trying to get the cut I was after the most, the reason I had accepted the upcharge - the filet mignon. It just never came.  I asked literally every gaucho there, all six, to bring it to me. It didn't happen. Not until I flagged down our waiter and all but demanded the filet. He had to go chase down one of the cooks who, many minutes later, came straight to our table from the kitchen, and dumped a couple of cubes of the stuff that ranged in temperature from \"cool to the touch and bleeding\" to medium well. In fact, none of the \"premium meats\" they'd pushed so hard at the beginning were in circulation. Just lots of chicken and sirloin, over and over and over again. No bacon-wrapped filet, none of the most premium cuts. They never once made it to our table without us having to ask for it. It was just the cheap cuts repeated ad-nauseum.  In the end we were rushing out the door, not even having had time for the dessert despite all the time we spent there. The manager did check on our table, but we didn't want our frazzled and apologetic waiter to get into trouble, so we didn't report our dissatisfaction to him. But, there are indeed serious problems with the front-of-house at this Fogo location, and we will not be back.  There are also some likely backroom problems too, featured in this photo. Who would plate a plantain splooge like this? Yuck!",

    "text": "This was my second Fogo experience, the first being in Boston for lunch. We did the restaurant month special which meant we missed the filet mignon and a couple of other meats. Overall the meat was very good, tender and tasty. The market table (really just a soup and salad bar on steroids) was good, but sometimes quality and taste is sacrificed for quantity. Overall it was a nice but not fabulous eating experience. I will add that I'm not a huge eater, but was able to have sample most of the meat without walking away with that awful feeling of being overly stuffed.   Like another reviewer noted, staff was lax about removing plates when you returned to the salad bar. This made for a crowded table at times.   The disappointment of the experience were the cocktails. They were very expensive and small. We arrived during happy hour, but learned that only applies if you sat at the very small bar.  Finally, if you are looking to take advantage of the parking validation, make sure you park in the correct lot. There are two, side by side and named Oliver Building, but only the one closest to the restaurant counts.",

    "text": "I guess I'll begin at the beginning because it's the very best place to start. We had a reservation for 8:15pm, didn't get seated until 9pm. I don't really that long at a restaurant I DON'T have reservations for. The waiter comes to the table and shows us the menu (the special was 35.18 for restaurant week, not even 4 dollars off, and it's not the full meal option and wasnt clarified on their website). My partner had bariatric surgery and he can't even get the half off of the limited experience, he HAD to pay half off of the full meal. We ask the waiter for a moment to decide and we're left alone for almost 10 minutes. Then a different waitress comes and when we showed her the bariatric card she had no idea about half off, even though we told her about their website staying it and she had to go ask the manager. Apparently it takes 15 minutes to ask the manager one question. She finally comes back and confirms the discount and takes our drink order, which we never received and it wasn't until the end of the meal that she noticed. So it's about 9:30 before we can even start eating. We get up to the salad bar and it is completely picked over. Literally 5 slices of salami and no cheese. The restroom was a messm paper towels all over the floor, the toilet looked like it hasn't been touched all day, and the sink had a huge crack in it.The only saving grace was the one waiter we brought our complaints to who was apologetic (but didn't offer anything other than an apology). Texas de Brazil has a better meat selection (while at Fogo de Chao we were only offered 5 different meats), their salad bar is larger, and have NEVER had to wait when we had a reservation). Will not go back.",

    "text": "This was the first Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to, so I can't compare it to any others.  Like the others, it's pricey at about $48 for the \"full experience\" as they called it, but if you're going to go to a normal fancy steak house (i.e not Longhorn), you'll probably pay close to that and not get all you can eat, so it's not that bad if you think about it that way.  The first thing you try is the Market Table.  Sort of like a salad bar on steroids.  Definitely a lot higher quality and selection than most other salad bars you'll ever try.  Next the meat, they had about 7 selections to try.  They bring it to your table and cut it for you.  It was decent.  Not the best meat I've ever had, and the chicken was way too dry, but overall decent.  The only thing I'd really complain about was the side items.  Not that they were bad, in fact, I think they were better than the meat, but for our table of 2 adults and 2 children, they only brought out one little plate of mashed potatoes, and one little plate of caramelized bananas (which were awesome) and something else that was tasty but I don't know what it was.  I kept hoping they'd ask if we wanted more sides instead of meat, but they kept bringing on the meat.  Overall, it's probably not a place I'd go back to as we don't eat out at fancy restaurants very often, but definitely worth the experience at least once.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing experience. Texas de Brazil is much better food for around the same price. Their market table has more options as well as numerous deserts that are included in price vs. at Fogo you have to pay for desert and appetizers separate if you want them. We felt scammed based on the fact that I ordered the full churrasco experience which is supposed to include all the cuts of meat in the Brazilian cuts option (which is what my husband ordered) plus upper cuts and I never got them. I finally after an hour questioned why we were only getting a few of the same cuts of meat offered to both of us and I wasn't getting any my husband wasn't getting as well as all the cuts listed on the Brazilian cuts option weren't ordered. Waitress said to keep with Brazilian custom the upper cuts aren't served until the very end and had no answer as to why we weren't getting all the cuts advertised for the Brazilian option. I complained that if I'm paying more, I should receive the upper cuts as well before I've eaten to where I'm full. I never received the upper cuts and then had to request I be charged for what I had. None of the meats were very flavorful and they did ask how wanted cooked and even though requested medium rare, they were all either medium or well done.",

Take it from me, pace yourself. The restaurant is beautiful and clean. The service is on point and everyone is so friendly.   My favorite of the meats was definitely the bacon wrapped steak. It had amazing flavor, was cooked and seasoned perfectly.   The side dishes they set out are good as well, mu favorite was the caramelized banana. It was sweet and unexpected.  The market table had a terrific selection of salads,  fruits, vegetables and other items. My favorite from the market table was the candied bacon. I could eat a platter of it be itself!  Overall a great experience and will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "Came here for their weekend brunch, which is around $40 per person, for their Fogo experience.  It includes the steaks, market table (their salad bar), waffles, and an omelette station.  What's hot - Quality.  Very delicious!  Their meats are tender and nicely seasoned.  Mine and hubby's favorite steak was the bacon wrapped steak.  Tender, flavorful, and just a bit smokey.  Their yogurt parfaits for their weekend brunch are not too sweet- the granola is a tad sweet with plain Greek yogurt  and there are fresh blueberries.   - Variety.  There's smoked salmon, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, caprese, different cheeses, fresh kiwis, pineapples, guava, etc...  Their waffles looked good.  Freshly made with whipped cream on top.  Their omelette station made fresh for you.  Love the variety! - Service.  As we went through the food, a couple of their wait staff asked us if there were any particular meats we wanted/preferred.  We said we liked the bacon wrapped steak.  Ask and you shall receive!  They made sure to bring us a couple of portions of that.  Additionally, staff were good about clearing our plates and refreshing what we needed.  They answered our questions, were polite and helpful.  We also noticed they bring free cake for birthdays, which is cool.  Take note!  Haha...  What's not - Parking.  This place is downtown, so you gotta be prepared to pay for parking.  Because we came on a weekend, their parking isn't free.  According to their website, they validate parking and parking may be free after 4pm on weekdays.  We paid $4 for our parking, which is the parking garage right next to the restaurant.  Not that bad, given the location.  But be prepared. - Price.  It's $40 for the Fogo brunch experience.  This includes their waffle station and omelette station.  No brunch drinks included, like their mimosas.  But oh well, I can kinda live with that.  Hubby and I didn't try their waffle and omelette station even though we really wanted to.  We prioritized.  Haha...  We focused on the steaks and the foods we don't have the chance to eat much.  Given the amount and quality of the food, it's a pretty good balance.  Just be prepared that this will cost you and that you may not eat everything you want to try.  It's not a place to go on a regular basis. - Service.  We noticed that service slowed down toward the end of the brunch hours, because their staff started to eat after their shifts.  Nothing wrong with that, but be prepared.  We also came with a gift card and it took a while for them to do what they needed to do for that.  Why, we don't know, but whatevs.  Final answer Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back.  However, this is a place for special occasions.",

She said she was looking at her staff partner across the room ( who at the time had his back turned to her so her response made no sense ) right there I knew her lack of interest in my child would affect her tip. Also no new rice or bread ever appeared on the buffet table . Bacon, several fruits , etc . They ran out and did not replenish ! At 50$ a person this is unacceptable ! We wanted the full experience .! What we got was 30% maybe ??? And I had to ask the hostess for dessert to celebrate my daughters birthday because I'm assuming our waitress forgot ....??

    "text": "Got steak? This place certainly does! Fogo de Chao is a full-service Brazilian steakhouse. If you've never been, the experience is a carnivore's dream worth experiencing.  In addition to an appetizer buffet table (think fruit, vegetables, table meat cuts, etc.) and a small pre-set menu, diners have the option of purchasing a continuous service steak dinner. Here's how it works:  If you want meat, you'll flip a circular card to its green side. Pretty much immediately, you will be served by staff carrying trays of different styles of meat. If you need a break, you'll flip the card to its red side and service will stop. And you can go back and forth between green and red until you're good and stuffed.  Whatever you order, the food will be gooooood. Steak service? Excellent; and everyone will be able to pick a favorite from the range of steak and chicken (and bacon-wrapped steak and chicken) being served. The appetizer/salad bar? Very nice - a great way to nibble on lighter foods when you need a break from all the protein. Even the standard menu is pretty good; I ended up ordering salmon off of it during my last visit because I suddenly wanted fish, not steak. And who am I to argue with my stomach? It ended up working out, and I enjoyed a great cut of salmon while my family got their steak experience.  The only reason my review isn't five stars is because Fogo de Chao was seemingly not prepared for the crowd during my last visit on Father's Day. It took a looooooong time that day to get food ordered; to get drinks; to get our check...pretty much anything other than the continuous steak service felt like it was on the staff's back burner. One family member even commented that the bathrooms needed some TLC and restocking, too. Granted, every restaurant can have a bad day. But to not be prepared for the rush on Father's Day...I was admittedly frustrated and disappointed, especially after so many good past visits.  While that specific experience kind of scared me away from visiting Fogo de Chao for a holiday again, its service otherwise has been top notch. So I will still be back for delicious cuts of meat and sweet, carnivorous indulgence. Plus, I'll be back \"just because\" - and really, isn't that the best kind of dinner, anyway?",

They have an endless stream of gourmet meats offered to you by professional, knowledgeable wait staff when you flip your table card to green. If you want to take a break from meats, they also offer a salad bar with a wide selection of food!

It doesn't include a few of the meats like the filet mignon or lamb chops but it is still plenty of cuts. The top sirloin was by far my favorite. The Parmesan encrusted chicken, lamb, pork, bacon-wrapped filet were all delicious too. They bring some small sides to the table and there is a huge cold bar. I had some salad from there and mashed potatoes that they brought but tried not to fill up on those.   I had a red blend wine that paired very well with the meats and my husband was offered a glass of Malbec that was \"extra\" somehow (poured by accident for someone? I'm not sure. But we weren't passing it up!) and he really enjoyed it.   The dinner included a choice of dessert (there were 3 to choose from) and because we were celebrating a birthday, my husband was able to choose from the larger dessert menu. We shared the flan from that and it was delicious. Save room if you are able!  The decor is very nice inside, the service was fantastic abc special bonus - they comp your parking next door!! So no need to worry about that additional frustration downtown. We will return for sure.",

The place was empty when we got there I believe there was only one other table filled with people. All 3 of us ordered the Fogo Experience. The Fogo experience includes all the meat you can eat and the salad and soup bar. I would say the salad bar alone could be a meal and make you too full to eat anything. The service was totally outstanding among the best service I have ever received in any resuraunt ever. The salad bar was good and the selection was excellent. I tried a bunch of the different meats but in the end I stuck with the top round sirloin and the filet mignon. The actual steaks where good to be honest they where better than a lot of places but not the best I ever had. The experience is $50 plus drinks and tip by the time we where done it was $230 for 3 of us. I would say Fogo is a bit pricey. I would recommend it especially if it is not overly crowded. The service alone I would give 10 stars but the food I would say is between a 3-4 so I will give them 4 stars. I would probably go back again in the future as the food was good and like I said service was outstanding.",

    "text": "My plus one and I attended the Yelp event at this location and I throughly enjoyed my time!  [Drinks] My friend and I were greeted with the most refreshing \"fogo caipirinha,\" one of the Brazilian cocktails. If you like lime, you'll enjoy this one. Also the red wine they presented at the tables paired perfectly with the red meats. The wine had a fuller body and was on the dryer side.  [Food|Appetizers] I had a chance to try the fresh shrimp appetizer. These shrimp super big, juicy, sweet and fresh! The cheesy bread (pao de queijo) was addictive. Though I hadn't tried the sliders, they looked amazing. The garlic mashed potatoes were straightforward yet delicious. I also tried a sweet-and-salty banana dish. The beef empanadas were sweet and chock full of meat. My favorite appetizer was most definitely the shrimp, though it didn't come with any sauces.  [Food|Market Table] The salad bar offers a variety of fresh veggies, amazingly sweet fruits and fancy cold cuts and cheeses! Strangely, I was most impressed by the quality of the fruit. The pineapple, honeydew and cherry tomatoes help cut through the fattiness of the meats. Of the meats, I liked the candies bacon the best. I also really liked the apple salad!  [Food|Meats] The top sirloin, tenderloin, rib eye and chicken leg were simply seasoned yet quality in flavor. The dry aged NY Strip was tender. The rib eye outstanding. I loved the pork sausage -- the seasoning, the snap. Although I must confess the meats were a bit too salty or at times over cooked for my liking.  [Food|Dessert] Yes yes yes. I was offered the original cheesecake, key lime cheesecake, and chocolate mousse cake. The plating alone was enough to impress me. The cheesecake was thick and beautiful. The key lime cheesecake was light, refreshing -- my personal fave. And the chocolate mousse cake was unforgiving in its rich decadence.  [Service] The main reason for the 5/5 review would have to be the staff. Although they were overworked due to such a hectic and demanding event, each worker was friendly, hardworking and upbeat.

Though I tried so many different menu items, standout were hands down the enormous and well seasoned cocktail shrimp, the amazing chartreuse selection and fresh salad options at the buffet portion, as well as the filet mignon, aged steak, and lamb!  Every item of this meal was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The wine and drinks were excellent! The staff was fun, friendly, knowledgeable, and definitely enhanced the entire experience!!   I would recommend this place to anyone for a special occasion, or just to treat yourself to an excellent meal!!",

I just love the salad/cold bar. I love all the cheese selections, salad, bacon,bread and vegetables. Everything was fresh and oh so delicious!! Our waiter was absolutely amazing .. Along with the staff ..we couldn't have asked for better service. I love the cocktail menu .. Cucumber mint cocktail is out of this world..So refreshing and full of flavor.   The mashed potatoes and platens were delicious. I love practically all the meat that was served and if I were to pick a favorite it would be the ribeye.  We got a side of steak sauce which was really nice to have.   I like my meat medium well which seems to be the standard but my boyfriend prefers well done. I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to provide my boyfriends preference several times!!   We did our best pacing ourselves but eventually got full. I even kept flipping my card over to take a break but eventually I couldn't do anymore.    The restaurant had special cards made for Valentine's Day that were in the shape of a heart, which was so cute and such a nice touch!!   For dessert we shared the molten lava cake which was outstanding.  It was a great special dinner and evening just like I knew it was gonna be. We can't wait to return!!",

    "text": "This is definitely a fun unique experience to try out at least once while in Pittsburgh. The service is excellent and the restaurant is very spacious.   We went here during fogo restaurant month and for $35 you get access to their market table, all the meats and a dessert!   The market table has a variety of selection of appetizers ranging some salads, a selection of meat and cheeses, rice, beans, soup, vegetables, etc. you can fill up on just this table alone so make sure you don't overdo it and save room for the meat.   Now on to the meat. There's about a dozen different rotations meats ranging from pork to chicken to steak coming that the waiters shuttle back and forth from the kitchen. At the beginning they give you a round plate that is green on one side and red on the other. If your plate is green that means you are ready for the meat, when it is red it means you are taking a break. The meat is overall pretty good. There are some meats I preferred less such as the lamb. The chicken was always fantastic.   Finally, for dessert we chose the key lime pie and cheesecake. As we were pretty stuffed from the dinner we took those to go and enjoyed them the next day.   We also ordered a bottle of wine which paired really well with our meal. Overall fun experience, definitely go make dinner reservations!",

    "text": "At long last I have found the best Brazilian steakhouse in the 'burgh, possibly in the states! I generally trust fogo over other churrascarias because the meats are seasoned properly, they are a generally nice chain, and the grade of the steaks somehow taste much better than those from other chains such as Texas de Brazil (note to all yelpers: always choose fogo over Texas because the quality is so much better).   That said, this fogo location, despite its superior rank to all the Brazilian steakhouses in the 'burgh, outdoes itself by being, in my opinion, the best fogo I've been to (sorry LA, Chicago, DC, and Philly Fogo locations, Pittsburgh finally has something to be proud of). Although the classy look of the restaurant in Pittsburgh may be similar to the locations, the service here is completely unmatched. The Gauchos were really on their game and each of them, by the end of the evening, knew the exact level of doneness I wanted my meat. We never had to wait long in between cuts, which was very impressive for a restaurant of this scale. The other servers were also friendly and efficient at refilling drinks and side dishes. Bravo to the team, led by the enthusiastic and welcoming manager, Nico.   Regarding the meat - everything was perfectly seasoned (the right amount of salt and garlic) and all cuts were incredibly tender. I look forward to having special celebrations here!",

I'll compared them to a margarita and sangria. Once we were seated several bottles of wine were presented to the table and the drinks just kept coming!   We started at the salad/cold bar. You'll find salads, marinated vegetables, cured meats and cheeses, and breads..it's enough you might be full after your first plate! Don't stop there...flip your \"card\" over to start your meat service. We tried everything cut of steak, lamb and chicken. All meats are cooked medium, but can be cooked longer by request. Don't be after to ask for what you want here. I promise they'll deliver. You can flip your \"card\" back and forth to start and stop the meat service again.   As if we hadn't eaten enough food, dessert was served. Eat plate contained three different cakes - cheesecake, key lime and a chocolate mousse. Needless to say we had our fill. To top of the night we each received a gift for a return visit.   I can't stress enough the exceptional service. This was by far the best Yelp event I've attended. You will not be disappointed with what Fogo has to offer.",

I really liked their card system (where one side is green for more and the other is red for stop). I would say I'm on the slower side when it comes to eating, so the system allowed me to pace myself and not get overwhelmed with all the food.

There are a few menu choices available but most people just get the same option that includes the salad bar plus all the meats. There a few good options in the salad bar, but don't fill up there. We are here for steak, not salad. The waiters come by quite regularly with different cuts of meat, chicken, pork and mostly steak. The cool part is you can try a lot of different types of cuts and see what you like the most. At one point a waiter saw we were waiting for something in particular and went into the back to get it for us. Great service and a solid drink selection too. The location is quite large, but I would still recommend getting a reservation. There is a parking lot across the street as well.",

    "text": "Alright so this is going to be a long review, get ready.  The short: 4.5 stars good food but with a bit too much filler for the price. Go here with friends or family it's a great meal to share!  More detailed version below:  The food: Honestly it's delicious, but it does have a few quirks. For one the lamb, their specials, and the beef ribs are by far the best portion of the meat they have a perfect mix of tenderness and flavor that makes you savor each bite, I wish I got more. Sadly I cannot say the same high praise for their chicken( literally all of it), the sirloin which is way too chewy, and surprisingly the bacon wrapped filet that was actually super dry, also the sausage is crap. Every side they gave us was great, the yuca and plantains are surprisingly sweet, the garlic mashed potatoes are a nice blend of flavors( especially if you get the peppery center), the cheese bites are just superb, creamy, sweet, cheesy, just great. The buffet is really good the cheeses, with a little meat is a great start, and to my surprise the figs, kiwi, and pineapple pair greatly with the meat. Finally, I wish I got more of the better meats they would sadly run out before they got to out table many a time.  The service: if it's you first time ask a few questions, I went there with a seasoned friend so we were pretty good but there were times where just got some much food that we couldn't eat it all so I wish in some moments they had slowed down. But, then again, in other moments they would barely come at all. That aside the staff are nice and if you specifically ask they can get you a meat of your choice.  The drinks: We just got tonic water to cut through the fat, but like they kept it filled.  The decore: It's a fancy restaurant so yea pretty nice there.  The price for what you get: I'm mixed on this one depending on how much you eat it's either way too much or actually quite little. To each their own I guess.  If you got all the way here thank you for reading, and have a nice day!",

The staff is warm and inviting, as well as skilled, knowledgeable, and they clearly take great pride in what they do. Can't wait to go back!",

I was a server at this location and must say, this was hands down my favorite group of people to work with and best environment I could have asked for. The management and staff are incredibly accommodating and friendly, as well as very hard workers who all share a great passion for providing great service and spreading Brazilian culture. I can never get enough of the unlimited options that the full experience offers, as well as the delicious drinks and complimentary bread and side dishes (the caramelized bananas are my favorite)! Also, the dessert list is off the charts as there are too many great selections to choose from. Once you flip the medallion to green, the gaucho chefs are attentive and eager to serve you all the different cuts of meat. The environment is classy, yet comfortable and I can guarantee you will never leave here still hungry. I've been to other Brazilian Steak Houses with similar concepts, however, due to the high quality and impeccable customer service, this will always be ranked #1 in my charts. This is a must see during your stay in Pittsburgh! Would highly recommend.",

    "text": "A group of 4 of us went on Valentine's Day weekend.  We we promptly seated and ordered drinks. They explained that the restaurant week deal did not include all of the meats so we opted for full experience, even though the deal never specified it was for a limited menu. The salad bar was ok, nothing special there. We did not receive clean plates for our main course of the meats so after the first round we got ourselves clean plates from the salad bar. They did not clean our used salad bar plates from the table for awhile.  At the start of the meal we seemed to only have one server, but he disappeared halfway through and it seemed that no other servers really cared but would stop by every 15 minutes to ask if we needed anything, which usually we needed our drinks refilled by that time. After the first 30 minutes or so, the meats were no longer coming to our table, even though our cards were still green they would just pass us by. We had to flag down some of them to finish our meal. Also, one of the members of our party requested chicken to be brought around from multiple staff members and then finally gave up after a half hour. This is my second Fogo experience, the other was in another city and it was fine, but I will not come back to the one in downtown Pittsburgh.  Go to Green Forest or Texas de Brazil if you are looking for a good experience, I would recommend both of those.",

I don't like that they do not assign waitstaff to tables-- I was told I could flag anyone down if I needed anything but there must have only been like  3 for the entire restaurant which means you can't get anything. I was unable to get a refill on my soda, and my husband was unable to order drinks. The meats were good but they only had about 6 selections. The salad table thing doesn't have much. When waitstaff finally came, I was about full, so I hastily ordered the check without the table being cleared. The table next to me had ordered their check and waited for over 20min so I knew I had to act. Overall, I don't recommend them because of subpar service and small selection. I actually recommend their competitor in station square where you get assigned waitstaff, larger selection at the salad table (they even have sushi, fish, etc), and larger selection of meats.",

Trying to get a reservation via phone proved to be difficult and the line hung up on us twice and then were told there was no availability. We managed to secure a reservation online via OpenTable. Once we arrived a hostess did not check to see if we were waited on and checked in the guests in line behind us. Tables are a bit crowded together and this didn't allow for a more intimate dining experience. We also only received the pao de queijo (cheese bread) and did not get any crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, or caramelized bananas which were supposed to be served continuously throughout our meal.  These are the reasons I have deducted a star. Other than the initial first impression, the food and wait staff were great. I was impressed by the Market Table and Feijoada Bar, which had a diverse selection of salads and charcuterie with unlimited visit per meal. The fire roasted meat selections were high quality, well cooked and seasoned with the table side service being quick and prompt. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and made some drink suggestions based on popularity and his own personal choice. The atmosphere is upscale, but approachable, with fresh linens placed on every table prior to seating. It was overall a good experience, but I'm unsure if I would visit again unless it was a special occasion.",

The Market Table is just a fancy name for a vegetable heavy buffet. I don't eat beef or pork so I opted for the Chilean sea bass. I expected it to be a little spicy or even seasoned but instead it lacked texture and the entire plate was just sweet and one note. My friend felt the same way. I orded a d'asti Moscato that was tasty and was glad I didn't want a second one as they ran out. For there to be so many staff members on the floor the service is slow and confusing. I had a waiter come to my table at least twice offering me someone else's drinks. The garlic mashed potatoes were the star of the dish. And although very slow, the servers were polite. Will I check out this place again? Probably not! Was the ambiance nice? Yes! I just don't feel like it lived up to the hype though. It's fine dinning but they're missing some of the details here. If you happen to stumble in here though their wine list is pretty nice. Because I try to end my reviews on a good note the dessert also looked nice but I by the time I finished being frustrated by my fish, I was over the experience.",

They have a parking garage behind the building in which they validate so you won't want to forget to ask them for a ticket before you leave.  The restaurant is fairly large and you are greeted by the Market Table & Feijoada Bar (salads, meats, cheeses, vegetables, etc.) when you walk in.  We made a  reservation but the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived.  We ordered the Restaurant Month dinner option which was $35 and included everything the full dinner includes except 4 meats.  Three of the 4 were the ribeye, filet mignon, and a lamb option.  Considering the amount  of other options there were it was OK for us.  I must say everything was delicious, my favorite was definitely the \"House Cut\".  Every item of this  meal was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I just wish I had a bigger stomach.  The meal also came with dessert which we were able to take home.  We got the cheesecake and chocolate mousse.  The staff were all very kind and knowledgeable.  If you have never experienced a brazilian steakhouse it is definitely worth going to.

The stew was more of a generic bean concoction, but no matter - the cheesy bread, plantains and potatoes served tableside more than made up for that minor disappointment. I could've done without our server's attitude when we all ordered the Market Table instead of the Full Churrasco experience (it's lunch!), but maybe she was having a bad day - I've had one or two myself.",

It took 15 minutes for us to get someone's attention to ask for water and 20 minutes later to actually get it.  It was our first time going to this steakhouse and we were VERY disappointed compared to our other Brazilian steakhouse experiences. Not only was the service horrible but the meats were very chewy and bland, which didn't make the experience any better. I would never recommend this restaurant to someone I know and will most certainly never be back.",

    "text": "Misleading! Beware! It says on their website \"Join us for Fogo Restaurant Month in Pittsburgh Monday, Jan 21-Sunday, March 31, Dinner $35 per person.\" It is just to get you in the door and then they slap you with a limited menu of meats. I took a party of 9 with the intention and understanding that this will be the Dinner that normally is priced at $49.95! No it wasn't! Fogo waits for you to come in to the restaurant and then disclose that it is not the same menu. No mention on the website that it is a different menu with limited meats and doesn't have the meats most people like lamb chops, leg of lamb, some prime cuts etc. I spoke to the manager Eric about it, and he explained that sure it is not disclosed on the website but here I have the limited menu I am presenting you with! He wouldn't budge to make the correction to honor the price for full experience and I was left with embarrassment to the whole party I encouraged to come and try Fogo's full experience! Will never be going again! Besides if you want to pay this much $50 go to Texas de Brazil, they have absolutely delicious meats (don't believe me try them both), sushi, more selection on the market table, Au gratin potatoes and to die for lobster soup. TDB's managers especially Michael are very personable and flexible.",

Each time she was pleasant and helpful in deciphering the wine and alcohol lists, and sending over what cuts of meat I preferred (I dined at 8pm the second time; meaning that was needed for the most part as they closed at 10pm). I highly recommend requesting her as your server; she was also helpful in determining what Port as an after dinner drink was the most well rounded and similar in sweetness to the Moscato I drank with my dinner.  I can't wait to bring my family in for dinner closer t the holidays; as I think they'd enjoy it. We are definitely big meat eaters as well as wine drinkers, so this is the ideal restaurant for us!",

    "text": "Update 09/2018: it gets worse! I guess we're suckers for punishment because we decided to go again. Server took our order and left as servers do. The night went as expected until we finally decided we were going to get the check. Server came over and we told her wanted the check. No problem. Came back after about 10 minutes but hubby already had the credit card out so he just handed it to her and she took it and left. We waited about 20 minutes for her and then saw her serving other people. What? So naturally we're annoyed by now and wondering where is our receipt and CARD to sign so we can leave. A few other servers came over to ask if we wanted a dessert menu but we told them we were waiting for our receipt to sign and told them who our server was. One guy came back and said they couldn't find our card. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!   Wait, there's more!  Not only did they not know where the card was, but our original server claimed SHE NEVER EVEN CAME TO OUR TABLE. Wow.   Eventually they solved the mystery of the missing credit card and comped the bill, but good grief. This place is just full of unpleasant surprises.    05/2018  Really great place for hubby to get his steak and pork fix while I took advantage of some yummy options at the salad bar. It's a typical Brazilian steakhouse set up, if your indicator is green servers come over and serve you a choice of meat. Their salad bar has a ton of options, salad, potato salad, string beans, cheese, a ton of stuff.  Only problem? So, my husband loves to chew ice and was chewing ice at the bottom of his glass w he realized one of the pieces was a piece of GLASS. Good grief. That was scary. The waiter was really apologetic but it was just really weird. I'm sure it was a one off thing but not even sure how that happens.",

    "text": "Ok first thing: This is the third Brazilian restaurant I've been to like this and I have to say, this one is my least favorite. This place is a hot MESS. There are people moving around you like busy bees working yet we had awful service so what in the world were they doing?? It was not a relaxing experience. Texas de Brazil is a smaller establishment and I've never felt that way.   My friend and I went for Restaurant Week and can I tell you that the moment we mentioned that, we were treated completely differently than when we walked in. This was the same for the tables around us who also said the same. You could tell the difference in service between us and the tables who came for the regular menu. I'm sorry but that's not right. We chose your restaurant out of A LOT of other places on the list, and we should be treated no differently. So needless to say, the service was awful. We had to ask for our drinks to be filled up several times. Our original waiter never came back, but he serviced other tables near us. We had to ask for new sides. We also had to wait 20 minutes for dessert because apparently they were out of one and the person who took our dessert order never came back and told us. The long curtains for the windows were in my way the whole time and no one would help me to push them back, even though I asked. Just awful service. However, the people who brought out the meats were VERY kind and friendly. The wait staff, not so much.   The meat was nothing special. I like the meat better at Texas and Green Forrest. Also at Texas you get their full menu for Restaurant Week - not at this place. I will also say their salad bar has a lot to be desired compared to the other two places. I enjoyed the watermelon and bacon, though. That's for sure. Honestly, I can't even say a meat stood out because it all just tasted the same. The lemon pepper seasoning was too pungent and bad tasting, I sure do remember that.   One thing I can say, is that the actual room of this place is huge and really pretty/modern. It makes you feel hip and sort of like you're at this high class place even though you're stuffing yourself with all of this food.   I will not be back. I'll be visiting the other two establishments where the waitstaff is friendly and attentive and the meat is actually good.",

My glass never got empty before being refilled, and I don't think I went 5 minutes without a new offering. Well worth the price!!!!

    "text": "To clarify, I grew up in Brazil and love the whole concept of the Churrascaria - we have been to several Fogo de Chao establishments, and have enjoyed them.  We brought some great friends here shortly after they opened. I make picanha at home, and thought that maybe it would be fun to contrast mine with the \"experts.\" Well, this one time made me really look awesome...  I get it that the place is new, and has a lot to learn. We will most likely go back after a year or so, to let them iron out the major issues. I personally think that there are two really pressing issues that NEED to improve, but may not be able to for business reasons (and that's why I'm not a restaurateur, but instead a gourmand...)  One - the meat seems to be \"roasted\" over gas and not wood fired / natural charcoal. I didn't see their kitchens, but the meat just didn't have the classic \"gaucho\" taste to it - it was good quality beef (and pork, lamb, etc...), but the flavor was just bland. Because it was early in their opening period, I think there were also not many meat servers, or \"gauchos,\" so the meat was able to get a little cold as they meandered around the tables - hopefully this will improve as the establishment becomes more settled and popular. The big draw for a \"churrascaria\" is it's meat experience, so this aspect has GOT to be spot on and of exceptional quality: fresh, high quality meats, prepared to perfect standards. The selection was a lot of lamb and pork, rather than prime grass fed Brazilian beef, too - could also use some improved traditional selections like real linguica (pork sausages) and chicken hearts / livers, if the clientele will go for it.  Two - Everything else was just \"average.\" The other times I have gone to a Fogo de Chao, I've had to actually prepare myself: I didn't eat the entire day before going, and I also had to make a mental note to not assault the amazing \"salad bar\" or gorge on delicious warm \"pao de queijo\" (cheese bread, made with tapioca flour) - these adjuncts have always made it easy for churrascarias to distract customers from the more expensive, high quality grass fed Brazilian beef. Unfortunately, this establishment had fairly modest and average offerings in these areas. Cheese bread was cold and hard, and the salad bar was what I'd expect from a T.G.I. Friday's. They mentioned \"Feijoada\" on their menu, and that is dangerous for any place that has Brazilians in the mix - feijoada is the traditional black beans and rice, with pork and other meats - it's the absolute paragon of the Brazilian culinary experience, and I wanted some. Only, there was none. Apparently we would have to wait until 3pm or something like that. Unfortunately, at $50 a head for average food, and with $13 caipirinhas that had too much ice, we just could not sit around and wait.  We will come back after about a year to give It another go, but it's really trying to define itself. I'm happy that this legendary franchise has opened here in town and is trying to elevate things a notch above what a Texas de Brasil is aiming for, but they do have to bring it. There ARE quite a few Brazilians in town, and we love good churrasco - it can't be phoned in.  Oh, one last critique - we had only one quick pass on the Picanha, despite talking to a gentleman we believed was the manager. Picanha is why we make the reservation - it has to come around, and more than once or twice to keep us making reservations.  To the proprietors: I hope that business is growing and that things are heating up! My review does not mean that I don't like what you were doing, but rather is a starting point - we support you and WANT you to succeed. If you can grow this establishment into the legendary mold of its predecessors, I believe nothing but great success will follow. I truly wish you excellent fortune, and will be back to enjoy seeing how you've grown! Obrigado, e eu espero que voces tenham todo o sucesso do mundo apos alguns ajustes.",

I kind of expected that, but we went to the bar area and no efforts were made to tell us that our reservations were ready in that area. I get that it was crowded, but I had to push my way to the hostess stand to find out that they had been calling for our reservation.   The absolute worst part was that I was barely getting any meat. I immediately flipped my medallion when I sat down. It was another 15 minutes until the first person came by with meat that was on our menu. Then, the meat that came by was slow and sparing. We later encountered another 25+ minute stretch where there was NO MEAT coming by. At other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, I was turning away cuts of meat I didn't want constantly and as soon as I got a few I'd have to turn the medallion over - at this Fogo I literally never flipped my medallion over to the red side. Then I left hungry because I had been there for an hour waiting, then another couple hours actually at the table, and I was tired.   There were a few positive points - the lamb, parmesan chicken, chicken wing and the bottom sirloin were extremely good. I didn't enjoy every cut of meat I had but I didn't expect to. I know the waitress and and meat servers were extremely busy so I don't begrudge them, and when they came by to ask if I would like a specific cut of meat I managed to get it. I'd give this place another chance if someone asked me to come out since it seems to be mostly organizational issues, but I would never pick it myself when there are other Brazilian steakhouses around.",

When requesting filet, sausage, or beef ribs.. we would have to ask 3 times before it would come to us. In general most of the meat was overcooked and at most Brazilian steakhouse they ask how you'd like it done. At the end of the night the wait staff didn't have a bill for our table and we tried to tell them what we had but the bill took over 30 min to get.  After we paid on our way out we we're stopped and said they needed to review our bill.  At that point we kept walking.. will not be back.   The good:.

Honestly, it could've been handled a lot better. I've been in the restaurant business for years and I've never turned someone away even with reservations on the books when my restaurant was only a quarter full. And we're talking a large restaurant. Just in poor taste. No worries, we hit up Texas de Brazil and had a great dinner.",

Loved the ribeye and bacon wrapped sirloin. The salad bar was OK. Nothing too special. But, let's be honest, we are there for the skewers of meat. I even had dessert which is something I never do. Looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "I highly recommend this restaurant for delicious Brazilian food. Having lived in Brazil myself, my expectations were very elevated. The food was on point, and there was everything I could have wished for, from the salad and feijoada bar, to the pao de queijo (cheese bread), caramelized bananas, and finally to the excellent cuts of meat grilled to perfection. The high point of the experience was the professional wait staff. Extremely kind, attentive and helpful. Give it a try!",

    "text": "Typical Brazillian steak house, great cuts of meat, not too much variety, no duck.  Salad bar was little on the skimpy side, service was good, meats were good. Don't expect to compare to NYC with their extended salad bar that includes fresh sushi.  But remember Pittsburgh is $48 per person verses $75 per head in NYC. Overall good value, real food.",
