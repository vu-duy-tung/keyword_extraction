Yovi's sells Chicago Style dogs along with some of the best french fries in the city.  The hotdogs are all beef and, if ordered Chicago Style, come on a poppy seed bun with chilis, rellish, pickle, tomato and onions.  It is kind of like having a salad with a hotdog for seasoning.  The restaurant is unassuming with limited seating.  The staff is friendly and helpful, but don't come for the ambiance, come for the fries!",

I had been meaning to stop by for a Hot Italian Beef sandwich, so I figured the dog would be a good litmus test for a future visit.  Yovi's is pretty small inside, just a counter with some bench stools and a few tables with two seats each.  Despite the size, I had to actually look for the window to order.  I ordered two Chicago dogs and they came out almost immediately.  While the steamed bun was on point,  the dog itself was bland and the toppings were mediocre...  while its the closest interpretation I've seen in PGH to the original, it just simply failed in execution.  On a positive note, my coworker let me try some of his fries and they were deadly good.  I'm assuming blanched then fried a second time given the thick crusty exterior and pretty smooth interior.  You can get some nacho cheese on the side and you're good to go.  Overall, I'll probably stop back at some other time to try the Italian Beef, but I was actually surprise by the price (over $6 for two simple hot dogs) and it was cash only (luckily I had some on me).",

    "text": "Previously I posted a less than glowing review ( below) . Because the people at Yovi's are so nice, I went back to give them another chance. This time I ordered the natural casing dog extra- extra well done. It was a much different -- and better-- experience!  The hot dog was hot, juicy and the casing gave it its \"pop.\" The balance of the ingredients was much better this time  -- not too much of one thing and too little of another. The tomatoes were sliced,  there were three or four sport peppers, and the onions weren't piled on. I will definitely be back at least once a week for my Chicago fix!  First review: I went to Yovi's today for lunch. I've been looking forward to it for long time - there are very few things in life I like as much as a great Chicago style hot dog! Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The hotdogs were Vienna beef and the buns were poppyseed, just like they're supposed to be. But the hotdog was VERY small -- it didn't even fill the bun -- and not nearly cooked enough! There was one little sport pepper on my hotdog and too much onion. And the tomatoes were in wedges, not slices. It just wasn't a good representation.  You're supposed to feel a \"pop\" and some juiciness when you bite into it; not so with this. A great hotdog is supposed to overhang the bun, it's supposed to be hot and juicy. All of that was missing.  I won't be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "This is my first review that is under 4 stars.  But do not be alarmed, sole person who reads this. I'm firmly in the \"if you don't have anything good to say, don't say it\" camp when it comes to reviews.  And there's some good stuff to talk about with Yovi's, and realistically, this is a 3.5 star review...but Yelp refuses to acknowledge my need for fractions. Yovi's Chicago Style Hot Dog's....that's about as completely honest a restaurant name as you can get.  They do hot dogs.  Chicago style.  And some other stuff.  But you're not there for the tamale...unless you are.  But you're a weird guy to look for tamales at a hot dog shop that makes no mention of tamales in their name.  Freak.  For those new to the game, Chicago style, or stizz-ile if you're Canadian and ten years in the past, is an all beef dog, mustard, diced onions, electric green relish, \"sport peppers,\" tomato slices, celery salt, and a pickle spear, all squeezed into a poppy seed bun.  It's called \"run through the garden\" for a reason.  Now, I'm a bit picky when it comes to hot dogs.  And this isn't a bad one.  But Pittsburgh is quickly becoming a Hot Dog Mecca, with places like Packs N' Dogs, Franktuary, Station Street Hot Dogs, and even the Rowdy Buck on Carson Street is getting into the mix.  So, a good dog doesn't quite live up to a 4 star rating.  The all beef frank was solid, but nothing special, and all the toppings were fresh and tasty, but fairly pedestrian.  And for around $8 you get a 2 dog combo, with fries and a drink.  You'll be full, but you won't be chomping at the bit to come back.  I think the biggest problem, for me at least, was that the poppy seed bun was a let down.  Less of the Chicago original, and more of a Giant Eagle bun with some seeds on it.    I'm not hating on Yovi's.  It was a good deal, really good fries, and a good dog.  All the Chicago nostalgia on the walls was like stepping through the looking glass in comparison to the \"all Pittsburgh all the time\" that is the norm in the city.  But next time, I might try the tamale.",

    "text": "Sitting on an alley (Graeme Street) on Market Square, this little hot Dog shop is a four step-walk-down harkening to the corner lunch place from the 60s (minus the racism).   You walk in, and while it is clean, there is little flair to this establishment. The dogs are pried pretty well, although a combo gets a little pricier than I think jsut a dog and fries and drink should be. Still, it isn't in the expensive category at all.   I wanted a dog with just mustard and made the mistake of ordering the \"Chicago Style Dog\" that was at the top of the list. This was on me, and it came with relish (very fresh) jalapenos, mustard and a pickle on it.   The dog was underwhelming. Not too plump, and not hot. The bun was good, and the relish (though i scraped it off) was fresh and tasty, if i do say so myself. The Pickel, on the other hand, wasn't quite a pickle yet. It was somewhere between cucmber and pickle. Maybe that is how is is meant to be? I wouldn't say it was \"bad\" just \"not done soaking\" maybe.   The guy behind the window was really nice and, even though i didn't ask for the combo, he threw in some fries (I'm assuming so i could try them.)   So I don't know... I had a better hotdog from the cart on the sidewalk just a half block over on Liberty and Fifth, but they were super nice and you feel like you are in a big city going into this (almost literally) hole-in-the-wall place.   Try it for yourself and see.",

Simply put, the food is excellent. The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. Chicago Hot Dog? Absolutely. Fries? Yes indeed. Even the chicken breast sandwich is excellent. Get some cheese on the side, put some vinegar on the fries and have a short mouth party away from your soul crushing office job. Bring cash, because like all the best Pittsburgh places, they dont deal in plastics.  Yovi's. Come for the Chicago Style hot dogs, stay for the feeling of finding an underground treasure chest full of delicious wonder.",

I waited in line no more than 5 minutes and by the time the nice lady at the register handed me my drink, she was also handing me my food. Fries remind me of The O fries in Oakland, very good.

I was sick of being at work so I decided to go get a hot dog snack. When I walked in, I did think the prices were a bit high. Basically, you can get whatever you want on your hot dog, but they are all $3.19 without tax. The hot dogs are regular sized but served on a Sesame seed bun.  I decided on a Chili Cheese Hotdog ($3.65 w tax). The cheese was nice and hot and the chili was good too.  The chili is mild, if that is a concern.  I gobbled the whole thing down in two minutes.  The guy who took my order was so friendly that it almost shocked me. I will end up coming back to try a Chicago dog just because he was so nice!",

You hear about overrated Franktuary right down the street, but no one ever talks about Yovi's. Yovi's isn't anything fancy and it offers the classic toppings, served with fries if you want. It's pretty awesome to find a Chicago hot dog right in Pittsburgh. The owner is from Chicago so whether it's authentic or not, I can't tell you for sure, but it certainly seems to be. I've never had a Chicago dog but Yovi's version was delicious. I loved all the flavors of the relish, peppers and tomato which gave it such a fresh taste. Yovi's has a few other sandwiches on the menu that I'm sure are good too, but it's hard not getting a Chicago dog because where else can you find one in Pittsburgh?? This is a great place for a quick lunch and I will definitely be back.",

Trusting anything Rick says about sandwiches and hot dogs, I was hopeful.  When you walk into Yovi's, the first two things you see are a life-size photo of Mike Ditka and a Chicago skyline photo that takes up most of the wall. A good sign. Chicago sports memorabilia is everywhere. This, like any good Chicago hot dog joint, is a simple place too focused on the food to care about any other aesthetics. I was grinning from ear to ear the whole time I was in line.  I was so excited just from being there, but when the food was ready I found another level of bliss. I had a hot dog and an Italian beef with hot giardiniera, and both were a taste of Chicago. The hot dog had all the classic toppings, even down to the poppyseed bun and neon green relish. The beef was juicy, delicious, filling, and piled high on delicious bread. The fries were fresh-cut, with skin, and done to perfection. Not only did all of it taste like the real thing, they showed that Yovi's is as good or even better than a lot of places in Chicago itself.  I adore Pittsburgh, but it's always nice to have an authentic piece of my hometown to visit when the craving hits. Thank you for all of it, Yovi's. I look forward to many more happy lunches.",

    "text": "I don't often crave hot dogs unless i'm tailgating at a baseball game, or sitting around a campfire cooking dogs on the fire, but after having Yovi's my mindset has changed! This is as authentic as it gets to a Chicago dog. The owner is from Chicago, and when you walk in you feel like you're steps away from Wrigley with all the Cubs and Chicago memorabilia.  My go to sandwich here is the Combo (Italian Beef and Vienna Sausage) with peppers on top. The flavors that come with every bite of this sandwich is to die for. Highly recommend the Chili cheese dogs as well if you're looking for just a standard dog! The french fries are also DELICIOUS!",

When I arrived it was around 11:45 on a Saturday and I was the only one there.  I believe it was the owner working behind the counter.  He was extremely friendly and engaging.  I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich meal which came with fresh cut fries and soft drink.  Everything was fantastic!  Fries and sandwich were great.  Restaurant looked very clean.    This is a True hidden gem.  I'm anxious to return and try a hot dog or another Italian Beef sandwich.  Great job!",

It wasn't the easiest place to find just off of Market Square.  You'll find it.  I walked in and was immediately greeted.  The order was simple for me, Chicago Dog all the way and fries.    The order was out quickly.  It was a picture perfect Chicago Dog that had been \"dragged through the garden.\"  Fries were good too.    The woman running the front of the house was extremely kind and spoke with me while I ate.  In the developed glitz and glamour of the square, Yovi's is just a tradition joint that stays True to its roots.  Great hot dog.  Great service.  Definitely work a stop!",

    "text": "My god, why does a hot dog taste so good?  That was rhetoric, but if you want to answer I'm all ears and will probably agree with you, whatever you say.    Yovi's appeared on my radar a long time ago.  So I have had my eye on the prize for a good amount of time.  It didn't take much convincing of my other half to come here, it was a to be a quick lunch for us before I had to head to work for the day.  And to agree on something in Market Square is hard to come by on short notice.  I like the feel of this place.  It is kind of rustic and feels like it was suppose to be that way.  I like the downstairs feel you get from it and really feel it adds to the character of eateries in Market Square.  We came here for a quick lunch one day.  It was after the lunch rush so that made for quick service.  My better half is from Chicago originally and when I told him exactly what Yovi's was, he was excited to come here.  Especially since they specialize in Chicago style dogs.  We go up to the counter area and place our order.  He gets two Chicago style dogs and I get two chili cheese dogs.  He downed his in no time flat, I took a little bit longer to enjoy mine.  The dogs are nice and fresh, served on poppy seed buns.  The chili and cheese on mine blended well and gave a little kick to mine.  I had also added diced onions which gave a little crunchiness to it as well.  When we finished and right before we walked out we talked to the guy working.  Turns out he is the owner and very proud of what he does.  The owner himself is from Chicago as well.  What better business to have here than something to remind you of home.  My better half and him strike up a conversation and we find out that when the Chicago Cubs come to town to play the Pirates, they do a pretty awesome thing.  But you have to basically be in the know for it.  I don't want to give it away in the review, in fact I implore you to go here yourself to find out.  It's quite a good deal is all I got to say.",

    "text": "Eating in downtown Pittsburgh can get expensive, especially in Market Square. Enter YOVI'S CHICAGO HOT DOG, a small, no frills hot dog shop. You can easily have full combo meals for less than 10 dollars. The dog, drink, fries combo is less than 8!   The traditional Chicago hot dog includes a juicy hot dog (obviously), spicy mustard, tomato, sport peppers, onion and  pickle/cucumber all snugged in a  poppy seed bun. And it can come with a side of hand cut fries (It definitely has the potato skin on it).  They also have polish dogs, roast beef, chicken breast, shrimp basket and hot sausage.   The place is located in the same entrance as the Yard, but you go downstairs to get to Yovi's. It's narrow so avoid coming with a large lunch group. Seats are usually filled to capacity (always a good sign), but I have always managed to grab a seat.   They have an outdoor table, but the air conditioner drips water on it, so you can't eat there for long. If you want to eat out, market square is a short walk away, so you could take your food there to eat as well.",

    "text": "\"Livin' On A Poppyseed Bun\"  Yovi used to work on the docks Union's been on strike, he was down on his luck, it's tough, so tough Now he works a diner all day Serving hot dogs, Chicago all the way, they're yummy, so yummy  He said you've got to hold on to both sides of the bun It doesn't make a difference if you order 2 or 1 But don't ask for ketchup, cause it's not done That way... These hot dogs are great!  Whoa, it's halfway eaten Whoaho, it's like a veggie dog with meat on Take my Sausage and put it in your mouth Whoaho, this is what Chicago's about Livin' On A Poppyseed Bun!  What to get: Chicago Dog, Polish Dog What else: Whatever strikes your fancy Speaking of strikes: The Union's been on strike. It's tough. So tough.  If a Chicago-style food restaurant is owned by Jon Bon Yovi, you know it's going to be good. I'd \"Runaway\" to Pittsburgh just so my prayers for real, delicious Chicago dogs would be answered. I've been \"Livin' On A Prayer\" of that sort for too long now. I know you have your fave hot dog spots in Buffalo, but \"You Give Hot Dogs A Bad Name\" when you suggest that they're as good as the Chicago dogs at Yovi's.  To get good Chicago-style food outside Chicago is a lot harder than it sounds. The vast majority of \"Chicago eateries\" outside Cook County are less \"Windy City\" and more \"Causes Wind.\" However, there are a few gems out there. Diamonds in the rough that are as good as anything in Chicago itself. And Yovi's is one of the most glittering of those diamonds.  What you must understand is that I'm obsessed with Chicago food. And I know it very well. Deep Dish Pizza isn't something Chicagoans really love. But if you want Pizza in Chicago it's Art Of Pizza (local) and Lou Malnati's (chain). There's only one Italian Beef *in the country* that I love. It's in the West Burbs of Chicago. Portillo's can go suck a lemon... it does nothing for me. For that reason, I've never even tried the Italian Beef here. However when it comes to Chicago Dogs and Polish Sausages, I start salivating and having tummy palpitations that have a distinct midwestern drawl and sound more like X than I care to admit.  There are quite a few good Chicago Dogs in Chi-town, but there are very few outside it. I can think of a couple in Atlanta, Nashville, one in Denver, Davenport... that's about all. Nothing else to write home about. Or write on Yelp about, I should say. However, Pittsburgh has one of the very best not-in-Chicago Chicago dogs you'll ever try. It's so good, that were it in Chicago, it would still be one of my top 10 places to get a Chicago dog, along with the likes of Fat Johnnie's and Kim & Carlo's.  The decor is extremely fun and Chicagoan. The products here are cheap and wonderful. The hours are limited (basically lunch-centric) but then it's in downtown, and hidden inside a basement, so that goes with the territory. I eat here literally every time I'm down in the Pitts. After filling up on dogs, drive up to Grandview Ave for the very best view of not just Pitt, but perhaps the best urban view in the country.  But back to the dogs... if you're in Pittsburgh and haven't tried Yovi's, you're really, really missing out. Get over here.  You won't have to go to Yovi's alone. \"I'll Be There For You\", these 5 words I swear to you. When you breathe, I wanna give a hot dog to you. And if other Chicago dogs you've tried taste more like \"Bad Medicine\", then you need to come here and try this one.   What a Chicago dog is, for the uninitiated, is basically a delicious IL-made dog on a steamed bun, with all sorts of pickles and sport peppers and onions and relish and mustard and tomatoes... it's basically been dragged through a Midwestern farm and has \"all the veggies.\" It tastes remarkably spectacular. It's not sugary sweet at all, so don't ask for ketchup. Not only will that ruin it, but it's offensive to native Chicagoans.  You won't get a much better version of it - and the more smoky Polish version of it - than here at Yovi's. Come and try them for yourself. They're cheap and wonderful, and this is the easiest 5 star rating I've given out in Pitt since \"India On Wheels.\"  It never seems busy enough in here, and that's another case of people not knowing how good they have it until it's too late. One day they may close down, and Pitt may go back to only having D's 6 Packs & Dogs (a good but overpriced and unauthentic version of Chicago dogs) as the flag-bearer for this wonderful and underrated food style.  I hope they stay open forever, but if they ever do close, they'll go down in a \"Blaze Of Glory\" because I'll show up on their final day and buy every Chicago dog in the place. I have to \"Keep The Faith\" that when more people discover how good their dogs are, they'll become more popular. I know Chicago Dogs aren't really all that healthy, but \"It's My Life\" and I want to eat them.",

The hot dogs are fantastic; buns and toppings fresh; homemade fresh cut French fries hot and crispy; and the staff was very pleasant and friendly.  I had the Chicago dog and a plain dog with only relish and ketchup. Both were right on point. The fries......yummmmmm! A little small inside, but it served its purpose. In the mood for fresh fries and great hot dogs...got here for sure. Definitely going back!",

I was a little nervous because the only other hot dog place I'd been to in Pittsburgh was the famous Original Hot Dog Shop and the hot dogs were horrendous and overpriced.  But OMG, this place has restored my faith! I got the one hot dog combo, which came with amazing fries and a soft drink for a total of $7.05. Such a steal and sooooo good. Next time I'm definitely getting the 2 dog combo.  I had cheese, onions, sport peppers (too spicy for me) and ketchup. I'm pretty sure all toppings are free, so score!   My coworker and I sacrificed taking a walk today to check this place out and I'm sure this won't be the last walk we push to the side to pig out on this deliciousness.",

The staff are always friendly and the place is pretty clean.  I alternate between the Italian Beef and the Chicago dogs. One day I'll pig out and get an Italian Beef and a Chicago dog and hate myself in the afternoon.",

They were delicious and at fair prices.  I got a couple pizza puffs to go, but they also have Italian beef and Italian sausage.  Well worth your stop in.  You won't be disappointed.",
