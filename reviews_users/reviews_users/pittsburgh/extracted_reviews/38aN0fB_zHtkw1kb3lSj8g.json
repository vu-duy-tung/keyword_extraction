    "text": "I think therefore I am...a pizza fan.  I just made a rhyme, wish I could do that every time.  See what I did there?  Michael's the quintessential neighborhood restaurant.  It is large enough to accommodate a crowd without losing it's intimacy.  We went on Friday (3/2/12) and there were two delightful people working and we were always well-attended.  And then there's the pizza...  My friend and I split a buffalo chicken pizza.  I commiserate with you if you've never tried such a pizza and feel you should rectify the situation; Michael's is a fantastic place to do so.  The crust was perfect--slightly doughy on the inside with just enough crustiness on the outside.  The cheese was solid enough so it stayed on the pizza yet was compliant enough to get those beloved strings when pulling your bite from the remaining slice.  The top surface was blanketed with perfectly cooked chicken.  Finally, the buffalo (in lieu of marinara) sauce had a great flavor, enough heat to keep you on your toes but not so much to kill your taste buds and preventing your pizza bliss.  Describing the ingredients doesn't quite do the pie justice--there is definitely pizza synergy going on here.  Alas, I do have to knock one start from the rating because this is a BAR and restaurant.  In my opinion, bars have evolved into carrying a large selection of beer and typically have more than a few taps.  Although I didn't do a thorough search, it seemed as though Michael's only carried the typical domestics that I have grown to disdain.  Pretentious?  Perhaps, but it's what I like.  In saying that, Michael's appears to keep it's corner bar image with a close, local clientele who may prefer domestic beer.  If so, Michael's caters to their customers' tastes and I commend them.  Try this place for your next pizza craving.",

    "text": "I love this Pizza.  I grew up in Carrick near Sunseri's pizza on Custer Ave.  I believe this place has or at one time had a family connection to that place.  They are similar, but unique enough to warrant a trip if you like Sunseri's.  The pizza is good, the sauce has a nice tangy oregano taste, bordering on sour, but in a good way.  The crust is soft and chewy.  If you go here and get nothing else, get the twisties.  They're hands down in the upper crust, pun intended, of bread sticks I've had.  Wings are good and tangy, but basic.  I prefer more depth of flavor than just buffalo, but they were cooked well, sauced properly and tasty.  They have some good specials too, slice nights, and hoagie deals.  Lastly, for some reason, I think that their fountain sodas are the best I've ever had.  No cola has ever tasted as good was what came from their fountain.  A small detail, but a perk nonetheless.  I've never had the salads there, but they look fantastic.",

This was a favorite lunch outing when I worked in the South Side.  Other recommended menu items are the Twisties (soft, baked sticks of pizza dough you can drip in marinara sauce) and the Hockey Puck (a hockey puck shaped lump of deep fried dough drowned in marinara sauce).  You automatically get cool points for eating here since it isn't directly on Carson Street, but be forewarned that this alone does not prevent the place from getting crowded, especially on Thursdays.  I once ordered a calzone from Michael's and ate it over the course of two days.  Those were a good two days.",

I placed a to go order for their turkey club pizza, but did have a chance to check out the place when I picked it up, and have to say that I really liked it; 4-6 small tables on the left wall with a long traditional wooden bar on the right (with dining seating further back), it felt cozy and very welcoming. The crowd was a very interesting mix, some elderly folks enjoying a meal, some young couples on dates, and even a few ladies out for the night, but not at all the collegiate atmosphere that usually accompanies dining in the south side. Now to the main event: the pizza! Wow, was it delicious! Loaded with cheese, lettuce, turkey, and bacon, on top of a thin layer of tomato sauce, it more than impressed me (for those familiar, it tasted like a delicious turkey Devonshire sandwich)! After 2 slices I was full and satisfied, leaving me with another meal for the next day. I lived this dish and will definitely be trying another one of their specialty pies!",

    "text": "Oh, Michael's. Lovely delicious Michael's. I have long drawn out dreams about the crispy crust, the perfect amount of sauce, and bubbly slightly burnt cheese.  I feel the real test of a pizza place is a plain cheese of a pepperoni pizza. Michael's goes above and beyond on that pizza alone. Not too greasy. On our last venture we decided to branch out and try the... Mashed Potato Pizza. While not an all the time option, it was amazing. Michael's regular crust topped with mashed potatoes, covered in cheddar and mozzarella cheese, real bacon, and a (as much as I hate this word) dollop of sour cream. Beautiful.   In additional to the great pizza, they have cheap beers too. The usual liquor options too.  The interior is small but cozy. It has the appearance of a dive bar, but I don't think I'd call it a dive. They have a lot of kitschy decor. Pizza pillows on the window seat, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Pizza Time clock. The first room has the bar and a few tables, there is also a little room to the back where more tables are located if you don't want to sit in the bar area. They've got a few tv's so if you're into sports you can stay updated as well.  Keep in mind Wednesday is 50 cent wing night and Thursday night's are the pizza special so those two nights can get a little packed.   My only other tip would be that while Yelp says they deliver, and my friend's confirm that sometime's they have in the past, when I called and asked they told me no. So, that may be a hit or miss situation.  Just look for the red neon Michael's sign off the beaten path of Carson Street.",

She didn't say hi or anything but definitely saw me. Two people came in after me and got served before I did. Then she took care of everyone who was already there making sure their drinks were full. At one point she checked her texts. At least fifteen minutes went by before she came over to me. Yea, she was a little busy, but not enough to excuse what happened.   After some people cleared out, I was able to get a little service. The food was pretty good and decently priced. I ordered the pepperoni roll and a personal cheesesteak pizza. The pizza wasn't bad, but the pizza roll was great. Unfortunately, the service ruined my experience.   I'd still recommend this place based on the food.

No problem...but the cook piled so many peppers on the pizza one couldn't see the pizza. The crust and sauce were good, but I found the sausage to be wanting.",

The pizza sauce and dough were very good. The sauce was tangy and the dough was just the right consistency. I did think the pizza was too greasy, though (partially remedied by sopping up some of the grease with the dabbing napkin technique). I don't usually like sauceless/dry rub wings, but these were actually tasty! Not sure what exactly they put on them, but they were nice and crispy with sort of a seasoning salt flavor.  The other great thing about this place is the super cheap beer: a Yuengling and Shock Top draft for $2.50 each. Awww yeaah.  If you find yourself in the South Side and hungry for some pizza, check out Michaels.",

I was a regular to the point that when I'd walk in, they wouldn't even bring me a menu, they'd just put in my order. Even after I moved to the North Side, I would still try to make the trip for the best pizza in Pittsburgh.   While the restaurant itself isn't fancy, modern, or fussy (although they underwent some minor renovations in the past 2 years), the food is crave worthy. As appetizers go, it's hard to go wrong with the twistees. Ahhh, the twistees. Michael's delicious dough twisted into golden ribbons, dusted with Parmesan and baked until perfect. Served with the best pizza sauce I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The hockey puck is also a pretty excellent prelude to your pizza. A seasoned, golden brown fried chunk of deliciousness shaped like a...well, you get the idea.  The pizza is perfection. The sauce is outrageously good, the cheese is a great quality, creamy blend, and the dough is consistently perfectly cooked. I could eat a whole pizza, it's THAT good. In fact, I have eaten a whole medium pizza in one sitting during the Michael's Pizza Challenge. Just to get a silly tshirt. I'm still proud of my accomplishment!  The service is always great, Megan is an especially attentive and personable waitress. Great place to watch a game, grab a pitcher, and enjoy the finest pizza in Pittsburgh.  P.S.

I usually prefer thin crust pizza so I wasn't expecting much, but this pizza was great. The crust and sauce was very sweet, the toppings were fresh, and it was all baked together to create a big gooey mess of deliciousness. It did take a while for our food to come out (not sure if that is typical), but the price is right, and the staff is friendly, so I didn't mind waiting.",

The pizza is very good, particularly the crust. The toppings were ample too. I really like their ground up sausage, which is a bit spicy, and their hot pepper rings. The sauce isn't the best I've had, it's kind of like a thicker spaghetti sauce, which makes the pizza a bit dry. If you like a good amount of sauce on your pie I'd recommend asking for extra sauce. As a side note, even with the 50 percent coupon the pie was a bit pricey. I'm assuming the coupon isn't valid for toppings. Otherwise, a good solid choice for pizza on the South Side.",

    "text": "I LOVE MICHAEL'S PIZZA & TWISTIES! The pizza crust, sauce and cheese are perfect. The pepperoni pizza or pepperoni and onion topping combination are also perfect. And those puffy, twisted cheese sprinkled baked dough twisties with the slightly gooey centers dipped in the delightful Michaels sauce are also perfect.  We've eaten here dozens of times and celebrated so many family milestones here over twisties, pizza and pitchers of Yuengling through the past several years. And we have Meghan, our favorite Saturday afternoon bartender. This little bar on the Southside holds a happy place in my heart.  In fact, most of my family members have also reviewed Michaels and have all given it 5 stars. My star deduction is solely based on one thing and to me it's a biggie - pizza toppings. My favorite pizza has always been pepperoni & mushrooms and they use canned mushrooms. I've tried multiple times to come up with a reasonable alternative and until we went with the onions, everything just fell short. I like jalapenos,they only have banana peppers. Tried the bacon and the spinach, nope not worthy. So pepperoni and onions it is! And I'm now a happy camper.  We've tried the hockey puck, a fried dough ball covered in sauce and its really good. The fried mac and cheese didn't do it for me & i can live with that. The hoagies come out weighing more than your head. If you enjoy a fully loaded hoagie, theirs may be your ticket to heavenly delight.  This little unassuming Southside gem on Sarah Street with the neon pink Michael's sign over the door is truly a happy find!",

It took until just a few weeks ago to finally try this place and I swear I might have actually teared upon seeing and tasting the first bite. I have spent COUNTLESS HOURS perusing for the perfect pizza joint to make our go-to and I am so thrilled to say that this is it. We REFUSE to live in the city and ever order Pizza Hut, dominos or something mainstream when part of the allure of the city is eating what non city folks can't readily get! There are a TON of pizza places on East Carson where we live, and they're mostly all greasy drunk bites. Michael's is top notch. Get pizza and garlic twist, you won't be disappointed! Thanks for saving us from pizza limbo!!",

    "text": "This is a review I didn't ever want to write.  This place is just too good. You know, pizza is something we all have a standard against which all others are measured. And the search for that perfect pizza is much like the search for the fountain of youth - elusive but clearly worthwhile. Michael's has restored my faith that perhaps that fountain of youth does exist - the perfect pizza certainly does! And Michael's has it! Sure, there's good pizza all over the place. But there's only one BEST pizza. I've had pizza all over Pittsburgh, all over the US (NYC, Chicago, SoCal...) and all over Europe including Italy. I've had Monte Cello's VIncent's, Domenico's, Luciano's, Mineo's, and all the chains - although I do like Piccolo Forno's too. My search has not been half-hearted nor without focus. I stumbled upon Michaels about 8 years ago and hit the motherlode. When I want pizza, I'm willing to drive the 25 miles from the north hills to the south side just to sit and enjoy my favorite pizza with a pitcher of Yuengling in a comfy bar atmosphere.  I wanted to keep this place to myself, not to tell anyone about it. After all, hidden gems are meant to remain hidden, right? Otherwise people swarm in and spoil a good thing. No one wants to go somewhere where everyone goes!! But alas, I find myself after 8 years of going here as a regular, finally wanting to shout it out!! THIS IS GREAT PIZZA!!!   Two blocks off Carson street on Sarah, it's off the beaten path and is not a place you're likely to just happen upon. You have to look for it. But once you do, you'll be hooked. First off, the crust is perfect, not too thin, not thick and doughy. It's a delight. The sauce is what make it. One thing I know it's sauce. And this is remarkable. Order the twisty's as an appetizer - parmesan dusted baked dough twists that are to die for - and you'll get a side of the sauce. Go ahead, dip in. You'll thank me. I could eat a bowl of that sauce with a tablespoon. And ask for more. This pizza just kills!! And if Meghan is working there, you'll be treated to the best service with a smile. She is absolutely the best. Good pizza, good service, good beer, good atmosphere. I call that JACKPOT!! What more could you want?   If I have to wait for a table next time, I'll know I should have kept this secret to myself!!",

    "text": "In all my visits to Pittsburgh, it was actually surprising that I'd never been here. My friends live within an easy walking distance and consider Michael's to be a favorite. After our dinner, I can clearly understand why. Michael's pizza tastes like childhood. How does that work, you ask? Stay with me on this one.  Imagine your favorite childhood pizza. You remember the smell, the taste, that feeling when that first bite passes your teeth. Now imagine the cheese, piping hot and bubbling. Do you see it now? That's how pizza tastes like childhood. Michael's pizza served that purpose for me. From the first bite I took, I was back in the early 90s. Michael's is lucky to have their pizza be the crowning glory, because the wings really weren't anything to sing home about. Granted, I'm very particular about my wings, but I know what I like. Also, skip the salad, unless you really like iceberg lettuce. I prefer a darker green with my pizza. Finally, this isn't a place you go to expecting an extensive beer list, so keep that in mind.  I'm glad my friends have Michael's in their neighborhood because everyone needs a solid pizza place nearby. It's great to have an easy flashback option in the form of piping hot pizza.",

We were expecting pizza that would blow us away, which made us a little disappointed. It's NOT that it was bad- it certainly was not. It's just not the next Mineo's or Fiori's or Aiello's. The prices were SO cheap, which I really appreciate, and the fries were fresh cut and super tasty. The pizza was good, and we did enjoy it. We were a little disappointed to learn that their ranch isn't homemade.. we are big suckers for delicious homemade ranch. Although we weren't blown away with our experience, it certainly wasn't a bad experience and we are looking forward to coming here to try out a special one night. The location is nice because it's off of busy East Carson and they even have outdoor seating. The service was very friendly when we came, which is always a plus.",

I live a few blocks from this place and every time I am at Aldi I drive past on the way home and think I should really try this place.  The service was excellent, we sat at the bar and ordered possibly the cheapest grey goose and sodas ever ($5)!!!  We ordered twisties at the suggestion of yelpers and a small pizza.  The twisties are their version of a bread stick and wow are they great!  Light, fluffy, and the perfect amount of garlic and oil.  I took the remaining home and used them as bread in my breakfast egg casserole, it was over the top amazing!  The pizza was great as well and tasted great the next morning cold (always the requirement for good pizza).  Between the 2 of us we drink 6 drinks, 1 sm pizza, and twisties, out bill was $38!  I can't remember the last time I ate and got tipsy for less than $40 for 2 people.  Check this great little family owned joint on the south side for your next pizza craving.",

But when you want something that will without a doubt be quick, delicious, and affordable, you can always rely on Michael's! As delicious as their food is, I do also really enjoy just hanging out at the bar. It's an awesome low key place!  I would really recommend that whatever you get, you get an order of Twistees too! The Little Charlie meal is always a great choice, but you really can't go wrong with anything!",

    "text": "We decided to try Michael's Pizza Bar & Restaurant one sunny Saturday this past summer.  A little off the beaten path running through the South Side you will find this little treasure.  First impressions, it's a quaint neighborhood bar.  The kind of place that if you live close you probably frequent.  I was really excited to try Michael's after hearing about their pizza. So that is where we laid our attention.  We ordered a large pie half cheese (for him) and the other half mushroom, onions, and banana peppers (for me).  Now I am like every other red blooded American, but pizza doesn't usually impress me.  It's ok, great to eat with beer, but I could never eat it regularly.  When I get pizza I like it to be thin crust, crisp, almost stand on its own, with veggies.  That being said Michael's delivered not only a pretty chill atmosphere but a pretty tasty pie.  Matt really liked the crust and the sauce.  I enjoyed the flavors as well, especially since they do not skimp on the toppings at all.  There was a plethora of veggies piled atop my pie.  This was good but came with its own set of challenges as the toppings weighed the pizza down, so there went my stand on its own factor.  That was ok it was still very scrumptious.  The one thing I really wish they would have done was use fresh mushrooms and not the canned ones.     Funny thing happened as we were eating and enjoying some brews.  A couple with a few kids pulled up outside.  They left the door of their SUV open as their kids slept in the car while they had some pie at the outdoor table.  I laughed cause I would totally do the same thing.",

The pizza was passable.  I've had much worse in the 'Burgh and I've had MUCH better.  This pizza, to me, was definitely worth the $0.80/slice that I paid for it.  It wasn't greasy, it wasn't too doughey, it was cooked well, but didn't have much flavor (we had plain cheese pizza).  It could have used some more sauce (especially since this is where the bulk of the flavor for the plain pizza is coming from).  It left me feeling very \"meh, that was ok\" about my lunch.     What else can I say about it?  It was a great place with a great vibe.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I probably want to see a menu next time.  I could think of several places in Pittsburgh that I would rather have pizza, but none in the South Side.",

I love that about it since the townies come here and are down to earth, friendly, and welcoming.

They have a wide variety of pizza toppings to choose from at reasonable prices. They also have specialty pizzas, like pierogi pizza.  If you aren't in to pizza, you might try one of the hoagies or an order of the Twisties (which is the best appetizer on the menu).",

It's nothing fancy and you won't find a four course meal, but it does the trick and that's all that really matters!   If you're into traditional bar food and pizza, then this place is for you! They have great simple choices (with the exception of crazy pizza toppings) and you will most definitely find something that will satisfy your hunger. The atmosphere is a step above dive. It was a Friday night and there were a few people at the bar and and most tables were filled with only one bartender/server. I do think they should have had at least one other staff member behind the bar helping out. We ended up sitting outside at one of their outdoor tables. It was a beautiful night and we wanted to take advantage of the evening.  I ordered a personal pizza with green peppers and a basket of cheese fries. The pizza was cooked perfectly and I loved how they shredded the peppers very thin. The fries were great because you don't find many places that give you that fresh cut/Potato Patch type of fry. It was long overdue! My boyfriend ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with chips and a beer. He mentioned that it was okay, nothing special. The bun looked like a regular old sandwich bun you could have got in a plastic bag at Giant Eagle. I think the sandwich would have been more appetizing with a more gourmet type of bun. Still, for the price, you can't go wrong! The total bill was only $20!",

I'm used to going to a more traditional, Italian pizza places but I wanted to try some down to earth pittsburgh pizza. Pros: Good cheese/ toppings/ generally a good pizza! Price is good Service was fast Cons: While the consistency was great, the dough could be salted a bit more. I really wanted a margherita pizza, but they had no idea what that was on the phone. I had to tell them what toppings go on it, and they said that cannot be done. I guess I was wrong looking for a margherita pizza in an old school yinzer pittsburgh pizza shop, but I'm kind of disappointed about that. That's a classic pizza topping!!  If you're looking for a down to earth pizza shop w standard toppings (pretty heavy, hearty pizza i.e. perogie pizza) then look no further. If you're looking for something more 'classic italian, thin brick oven style pizza,' then this isn't your place.",

They're maintaining Michael's menu and staff, but adding a new level of service. The AC was having some issues when my foursome walked in, but the owners and staff were incredibly accommodating and actually moved a table outside for us.  The beers are still frosty and the food is still delicious. The Ella's Roadhouse Fries are a favorite of ours. You can't go wrong with this off-Carson Classic that's taking on new life.",

They were just closing but still were able to serve us. We had such a fun time as the bartender was so fun and kept us laughing the entire time we were there. I had the chicken Parmesan with no bun (the served it in a nice little dish) and my boyfriend had the white pizza. I thought my chicken parm was great! It was just what I needed and found it was simple tasting. However, my boyfriend found the pizza average at best. But he thought it was due to the late night aspect of the pizza. All in all, it's a great place to come and get a good, quick meal and they have awesome daily specials. I def plan to be back as there $1 burger night has me super interested.",

The pizza tasted great - rain and hot pizza at a bar are an unbeatable combination. The girl at the counter was very helpful too.  I had requested extra peppers which was missing, and I did NOT see the black olives mentioned on the menu. For the size of pizza it was slightly overprized.  But overall I liked the place and the service.  They have a 80C slice cheese pizza for dine in only on Thursdays- a True feast for cheese lovers and students.",

That's it.   I'll also add they don't take pizza seriously enough to include it in their name. The sauce is flavorless and the cheese nothing to write home about. The dough tastes undercooked. Basically imagine pizza at a school cafeteria, and you've got Michael's.",
