The menu is pretty extensive and while it includes a lot of American Chinese food staples, it also ventures into a lot more authentic Asian cuisines for more adventurous eaters. I got to try the popcorn chicken as an appetizer and thought it was good and would be a great option for kids who maybe aren't into chicken with heavy sauces. It was very flavorful and you could definitely taste a lot of black pepper, but not too much. I also ordered the wonton soup which I found good and very typical of what I've had at other places. For my meal, I ordered the chicken lo mein and it was also good. It had some sprouts which I thought were a nice touch. It was also a giant portion as you would expect from a Chinese restaurant.",

This is not a typical Chinese restaurant (although they do the American Chinese stuff fine).  This is a straight up Szechuan and Taiwanese powerhouse.  Tan Tan noodles are ridiculously good.  Red Chile Dumplings are a come to Jesus experience.  If you love that tongue numbing feeling of real Szechuan peppercorns you must try the Boiling Fish soup or Triple Pepper Chicken.  These are not dishes dumbed down for an American palate, they are full of heat and flavor.  Do yourself a favor and resist the urge to order from the typical Chinese menu they offer and stick to the Szechuan and Taiwanese offerings. You won't be sorry.",

Me and my friends ordered Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which taste fine, but they first server didn't give us the side dish  which is very important to the noodle until the second server told us that it look like something is missing in your noodle . Then she brought us some, which is nice.  The Peking duck is the worst pecking duck in the planet I swear! It just some leftover duck which probably in their fridge in months and they fried it and it is called Peking duck.. It's not even half of the duck, two legs and some sort of random meat? And it taste absolute disgusting . The duck pancake is tortilla warp.. I highly recommend ppl do not order this dish.. You will regret paying 16.99 for this  Chongqin is over salty and all the Sichuan restaurant I have had in Pittsburgh had better  Green bean is fine, not great because it is salty for me but not too bad.  Nothing I like except this place is relatively spacious .",

Not only am I too darn hungry, I'm all for trying more authentic stuff!   Ordered 2 servings of chicken fried rice, 1 order of Ho Fun noodles with chicken, and a side of white rice. The man at the front desk was very welcoming and helpful, as I asked him about two of the noodle bowls and what they contained. After I ordered, he asked me what I'd like to drink, and when I requested water, he gave me a bottle! Quite nice of him. I was told the whole order would take 15 minutes.   The place is very calm and quiet, though it was sparse at the moment. I imagine if there were more people, it'd be crazier. In fact, they brought the food out in a little over 10 minutes, which was awesome.  Undortunately, the food is rather....bland. It wasn't that bad, since when I put soy sauce on it , both dishes tasted much better. The noodles were undercooked and partly hard, and the chicken fried rice was rather insipid. I don't know if this is what more authentic Chinese food tastes like, and my taste buds are not used to it, or what the case is, but I'm open to trying it again. Maybe these dishes weren't my favorite, or eat-in might be better.",

I was very pleased to stumble upon tings kitchen (former china star) on yelp. My mom and I were looking for a place to have dinner tonight and I suggested we go here.   When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the owner and taken to our seats. Our waitress came over and also warmly greeted us. She was very enthusiastic and eager to explain the menu items to us! I loved that. It makes me excited when other people find joy in talking about things they love. They are getting a new menu that will feature more Taiwanese style dishes! I can't wait to try it. Let's talk about the food!!  I ordered the lamb in sichuan style (17.95), the lamb was thinly sliced and was mixed with veggies with a hint of spice. It also comes with a side of rice. My mom ordered the zha jiang noodles with ground pork. It comes with brown sauce! The portions are really large, which is always a plus. I did give my moms dish a try and I loved it! So tasty!! Our waitress was nice enough to bring out a few dishes for us to sample different Taiwanese style foods. The one plate was filled with Taiwanese Chicken Steak (amazing), there was nothing boring about this chicken and it was extremely flavorful! The second bowl was noodle soup with pork and shrimp also very delicious! The last plate was the Taiwanese Pork Buns, these were also very tasty and a bit crispy which I like! To end this fabulous dinner she brought out Taiwanese grass/honey jelly and lemon jelly for dessert. I gave the grass/honey jelly a try, but couldn't get onboard with it, but I loved the lemon jelly!!   I would highly recommend coming to this restaurant if you are looking for an authentic meal and friendly service! I will be coming back and with my friends:)",

    "text": "Decent Chinese fare here ... for those that don't know, this place used to be China Star, but the establishment is changing names (likely under new management). The interior is probably still undergoing some changes, but it does leave a bit to be desired. On the other hand, the food here is decent. I tried Zhajiang Mian, a typical noodle dish which I found to be alright in my opinion. The taste was decent although it would be nice if the cooks cut the ginger into smaller pieces so as to obscure the taste of the ginger (it still gets the job done in smaller pieces, no?). As for the Beef Noodle Soup with Tendon, I found it be acceptable. Wish there were more noodles and the beef was alright. The soup was probably the best part of the dish. The scallion pancakes here are on point ... I really like the little bit of sauce that is included with the appetizer. Adds a nice flavor to the individual pancake pieces although the dish stands well on its own, too. Oh in general, great portion sizes here for what you pay. I like how accommodating the place is with side requests (i.e. can I get an egg with this dish? - yes). I look forward to trying other dishes the next time I get a chance to visit.",

I had never been here before but i passed it once and was curious about what Taiwanese was like. So my husband and I took our nephews here and we looked over the menu and decided on some pretty interesting things. I order the chilled kidney along with the intestines that are served in a hot pot. My husband ordered Duck and some fried rice for the rest of the table. He's not much into trying new things.  The kidney came out first and was surprisingly delicious. It has the consistency of squid but not so much the flavor. They marinated the kidney in a spicy sauce that had a lot of oil in it. The intestines were even better they came out in a wok style dish with a little flame underneath to keep it hot and bubbly. There were green onions, white onions and a few peppers to compliment this dish.  The duck was very delicious, some of the best I have ever had. I don't know whether they barbecued it or marinated it but it had a delicious smoky and sweet flavor to it. Plus duck is  fattier so it wasn't dry like how chicken & turkey can be sometimes. The fried rice was a good complement to the side dish. The only thing that I didn't like was that a lot of the food was cooked in way too much oil. Other than that the spices were very good and the presentation was as well. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I'd like to take this opportunity to announce my beef noodle soup quest, detailed as follows:  PROJECT OVERVIEW: Mission Statement: Try ALL the beef noodle soups Mission Justification: Beef noodle soup is really freakin' delicious. Secondary Justification: It's winter and I really freakin' love soup. TEAM: Team Lead: Me Team Members: Husband, Friends who can be dragged to various Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants SMEs: Fellow Yelpers ACTION ITEMS/NEXT STEPS: [1] Go to as many Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants as possible. [2] Order the beef noodle soup. [3] Slurp.  Now that that's out of the way, here's what I tried at Ting's:  HOT & SOUR SOUP: a fairly standard cornstarchy favorite.  Packed with egg swirls and veg/tofu matter.  Not bad, but needed some peppercorn action and was vastly improved by the hot sauce (a chunky chili paste) I asked for.  Then again, what isn't?  PORK & HOT PEPPER: husband's order.  Not very special.   I tried to talk some sense into him, I swear, but tragically failed.  Would suggest one of the more traditional dishes--anything \"over rice\" or the zha jiang mian (sort of like a Taiwanese spaghetti bolognese).  That's it.  Har har, I'm hilarious.  BEEF NOODLE SOUP: decently flavorful broth though not as rich and deep as Rose Tea Cafe's.  The beef was a huge step up though, though it was NOT tendon, as the menu advertised, but thick chunks of a nice fatty cut with some gelatinous bits.  Not completely flavorless, as most soup meat tends to me.  I ate the gelatinous connecty bits and left the rest for hubby, as I often do.  [SIDEBAR: depending on who you are, you likely feel he's incredibly fortunate to be with a girl who likes the \"weird\" bits/cuts of meat, as this leaves him with the prime cuts, OR that his life is incredibly sad.  If you're the latter, let's be friends.]  Noodles were nothing special--not fresh or handmade.  Toppings included some fairly bland chopped pickled mustard greens and a halved stalk of baby bok choy. BNS SCORE: 2.5/5  Our friends ordered the SIMPLE NOODLE SOUP WITH PORK/SHRIMP, BRAISED BEEF OVER RICE, and ROAST PORK MINIS.  I'm devastated to report that not only did I not try them, I woefully neglected to even ask how they liked them.  Though, judging by the fact that they had both cleaned their plates when my soup bowl still looked untouched, I'd say they didn't hate it.  No free desserts here, our meal ended with your typical nonsensical fortune cookies.  We did receive some fried wonton chips with dipping sauce to start.  One item of note, however, is that the service here is very much above average for an East Asian eatery.  Maybe it's because I was at a table with 3 white people and they profiled us (we also received forks and no chopsticks), but I believe they actually came by at one point to ask how we were doing.  What is this, a pasta place??",

I ordered simple dishes (sweet and sour chicken and a fried dumpling appetizer) - I figure if the restaurant can do those well I can return and enjoy other dishes. The dumplings were bland -the dough was tasteless, there were no vegetables in them (advertised as having cabbage and pork) and the pork portion inside was tiny.  Even drowning them in the dipping sauce didn't redeem them. I only ate one. The sweet and sour chicken tasted like old oil--and the chicken pieces were tiny yet there was a massive amount of batter on them. Yuck.   I ate the steamed rice and left. I took the leftovers home (my husband will eat anything) but I ended up tossing them in the garbage. I wouldn't subject anyone to batter balls deep fried in old oil and disappointing dumplings. I won't return.",

Nothing about their menu gives away the new offerings here--you'll have to make nice and talk to the staff (or just wait a couple weeks if you would rather do that). The owner is super friendly and made several recommendations for their Taiwanese specialties, which range from noodles to rice dishes to appetizers like fried chicken. We were impressed from the beginning at the presentation and care they put into making the dishes, and of course the taste of the food as well.   The fried chicken was made Taiwanese style, which is not very greasy and comes with a breading that is crispy and thin. The meat was still very tender on the inside, and the outside was seasoned with chili powder. The zhajiang noodles were very tasty--good texture, sweet sauce but not overly so, and a good helping of ground pork. Beef noodle soup was fantastic, rivaling the same offerings back in Squirrel Hill. The broth was deep and savory, the beef was soft, and there was the right amount of leafy vegetables, pickled vegetables, as well as a well-made tea egg. We were also offered a dessert of lemon aiyu jelly, which was cool and refreshing. Overall a delicious meal, especially considering that the owner and her husband actually puts care into making a lot of the dishes themselves.",

I would probably order something else next time just to try other items.

Ordering from the Traditional Taiwanese menu is the way to go. I got the Simple Noodle Soup which was wonderful. Rich broth, noodles, bok choi, shrimp, hard boiled egg, and pork pieces. All seasoned so well making this a great meal staple. I also tried the Red Chili Wontons- GET THESE! Sooo yummy! Just the right amount of spicy and all flavor. My husband got the Chong Qing Chicken off the Szechuan menu. This also had fantastic flavor! For my tastes though I wish it had a dipping sauce to combine with the rich flavor of the fried \"popcorn\" chicken.  The decor is simple and the lighting is low with delightful background music. Overall it was a delicious traditional meal and a comfortable dining experience. We will definitely be visiting again. I got my eye on the Szechuan Beef and the Hot Pot.",

    "text": "This place used to be called \"China Star\".  It is under new ownership but the restaurant has not been renamed on the door yet.  They said it won't happen for another 2 weeks or so.  Till that happens, it is going to be the old name with old menu.  You can either wait 2 weeks for things to settle or just ask for the new menu like I did.  Just don't get confused by the door sign.  I had conflicting reviews from my friends about this place so I decided to check this out myself.  From yelp, I also learned that they do both Taiwanese and Szechuan food.  (just to clarify, Szechuan is the southwestern part of china known for their spicy food, and Taiwan is the eastern-not-so-part-of-china).    We tried both the Szechuan and Taiwanese dishes.  And I am looking forward to their new Taiwanese menu.    Boiling beef (Szechuan) - the beef was soft and done right.  But the sauce was nothing but salty and spicy.  it is supposed to be more complex than that.  and to be honest there are better Szechuan restaurants in squirrel hill area. (3/5)  Taiwanese beef noodle: (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=6yQcm5wONjI9M9cCg_o8ZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ting...</a>) one of the best in town. (5/5)  Taiwan chicken nuggets (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=NLq9ud9hNAw-QnFpv7V3aw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ting...</a>)  crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  I think it is thigh meat not breast meat, which would be a plus. but i am not 100% sure. (4/5)  Taiwan pork rice (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=4LUy7n-J7Ca9jZE44QF_hg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ting...</a>)  it is really really good. but rather small.  I have heard they do lunch box / set dinner version too, hopefully those will be bigger. (5/5)  Zhangcha duck.  The biggest surprise of the night.  Crispy skin and fat enough duck.  (6/5)  There were few more dishes too. and free dessert (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=k8IU71im9pTAWFiiSEVz8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ting...</a>)  overall, I am looking forward to this place and certainly will be back again.  Just wish them best of luck, as their location is not ideal.  I won't be coming if I do not drive.  hopefully, they will do well in this Uber generation.  final verdict: best Chinese food in Ross township if not north of Allegheny",

There are so many good competitions that you end up actually having to make an effort to decide where to go.  Ting's Kitchen is my choice if I am up and about on Mcknight.  Their \"wife and husband\" appetizer (spicy tendon and tripe) is so good.  It honestly beat out this other michelin-star chinese restaurant I went to in NYC.  I also enjoyed their tea-smoked duck, fish in spicy broth... and I love that their menu is extensive so I can always try new things, or stick with my favorites.  The restaurant is fairly empty whenever I come by, but the food is on point.  Everything I order is super spicy.. I love and hate it at the same time.  Just a fair warning, if you don't order spicy food here then (maybe) you're not doing it right!  Don't come expecting authentic chinese food but order something Americanized or typical.  Taiwanese/Szechuan food is very distinct.  Ask for recommendation and be daring cause the food is on damn fireeeeeee (I mean spicy, not literal or overhyping).",

We ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, pork belly over rice, and a chicken flaming pan. The Taiwanese chicken was definitely my favorite of the three - it was well-flavored and crispy, and I also really liked the crispy basil leaves in there. The pork belly over rice was good and a decent portion for $6, but I have had better elsewhere. I was disappointed by their chicken flaming pan. First, the chicken was a strange pink color (I'm guessing from the spices that they used?) and was barely spicy at all. The waitresses were really sweet and our food came out very quickly as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but it's a good place to stop in for some authentic Taiwanese food if you're out doing some shopping.",

As such, this will be a quick review unlike my usual ones.  My wife and I headed here for dinner because I was excited to order their chongqing chicken. We ordered the red chili dumplings as our appetizer and they were decent and comparable to others we have gotten recently.  Then for dinner I went with the chongqing chicken while my wife ordered the salt and pepper squid.  My chicken came out first and actually was quite good.  It was hot temperature wise and super crunchy.  Actually it was some of the better fried chicken that I have had recently.  There also was some numbing from the Szechuan peppercorns but what I thought the dish was really missing was some spice.  Yeah it had the dried red peppers on it but I never had to take a drink of water.  After finishing my dish I started to help my wife with hers.  The squid itself was overcooked and so chewy and the whole dish felt rather dry.  After having only a few bites we noticed the item in the dish that shouldn't have been there and immediately called a manager over.  They thought it was a rice noodle at first but we persisted and they saw it wasn't.  At that point they assured us not to worry and that it wasn't a big deal and that they would bring us another.  Umm, no thanks.  They did take it off of our bill and my wife and I quickly paid and headed out of the restaurant.  The bottom line for me is that I won't be heading back here again in the future.  While mistakes do happen, I actively avoid places where you find something in your food that shouldn't be there.",

We ordered the roast duck noodle soup and the simple noodle soup (which was touted as the #2 Taiwanese soup on the menu!). The food came out quickly and I was blown away by the amount of duck in my dish! For $11, it was a very generous amount and I was very happy with it. The duck noodle soup was considerably larger than the simple noodle soup, but portion wise, both were enough to fill us up to our content.   Overall, the dishes tasted good, were a good price for the portion sizes, and I would like to come by again sometime to try their other dishes!",

Got seated right away since there were not a lot of people. I asked my waiter about the change. He told me they are still working on it and the full menu has not been completely changed out yet.  The first few pages of the menu is your typical Chinese American flare which you would find at almost any restaurant. The last couple of pages which has Chinese writing on the side is your Szechuan menu. If you want to know what is on the Taiwanese menu then you have to ask your waiter for those menu items.  A lot of the Szechuan items I was told were authentic Chinese food and much of it is very spicy. i lot of those items were pork items but they had some items that were chicken, lamb, and even fish. I asked the waiter what kind of chicken they use for that preparation and I was told dark meat because it is \"tastier\" when preparing Szechuan foods. I was exploring the fish options and he recommended one which came with Tofu. Normally it comes very spicy but I can order it non-spicy if I so chose and would get a dinner portion for a dinner price. Note-there are some items on this menu which you can get a lunch portion on and save some money.  I asked about what kind of fish it was and it was something I never heard of. I was debating whether or not I should order it bland but then I thought that it would be tasteless unless it has some flavor to it. So I decided to stick with the American side and ordered chicken breast with vegetables. Since it came as a lunch portion I ordered that. You have a choice of fried or white rice and one side which can either be a soup or spring roll. I opted for the spring roll.  When I got the roll I found it a bit difficult to cut with my knife but it was otherwise okay. My main course arrived shortly afterwards and it was a smaller portion with  enough basic fried rice. It was good but very similar to what you would get at most other Chinese restaurants.  I was given a bagged fortune cookie and wasn't offered a dessert as I had seen in other reviews. However, when I got my check it was written on it 5% discount if you pay in cash. I'll take a break like that anytime so I was able to get that discount once I told them I'd pay in cash.   This place is okay but I still prefer the one I ate at in Mt Lebanon earlier in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens once they complete their renovations and put in the rest of the Taiwanese menu.  I was able to chat with some people at the next table who had ordered the Szechuan lamb dish and although the portion was generous I was told it was spicy hot! Please keep that in mind if you can't handle hot spicy foods.",

EVERYTHING we had was excellent, from the seafood hot and sour soup to the hot pots and Taiwanese small plates.  The wontons in chili oil are a must have but so were the 7 other apps we ate before our meal!!  Service was excellent as well, very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.",

We grew up in N.Y. and spent a lot of weeks traveling China and this is a poor representation of good Chinese food. We tried this in the past and couldn't remember the name. It was the same place we had eaten. Disappointing! It was noon and there was only one person eating?",

The owner was very accommodating and they offer hot water along with ice water, so you know it's real.   The way to go is definitely family style, so we ordered the stewed meatball, braised fish filets, and roast pork minis to start. Each entree came with a hefty bowl of rice, so it was more than enough.   The meatballs and fish came with veggies on the bottom, so you felt like you were getting your fill of greens. Both dishes were sauce heavy but delicious.   My brother wanted a soup, so we ordered an additional lunch special of home style Tofu. Lunch specials came with a side of fried rice and soup. The sauce for this dish was overwhelming and will definitely ask them to reduce next time.   Overall, it was a very good meal and a solid experience. I'll definitely be back and would love to try their turnip cakes.",

What a surprise in P-town! The same location was originally another Chinese restaurant focused on Sichuan dishes (famous for spicy, heavy kicks), Ting maintained this part, but also tries to expand the menu a bit, bring the Taiwan (where she's from) flavors to the table.  The group of us are all from China, and we are fed up/so satisfied by these great food! A must try if you are in P town craving for authentic Oriental dishes: warm hearted service, fresh ingredients, sophisticated cooking skills = satisfactory eaters. Would def come back to try more dishes.   PS: DO ask Ting about daily specials not on the menu, she probably gonna surprise you.",

It was huge and so delicious not even kidding. My lunch entree was a decent size and the general tso sauce was good.  The main reason for 4 stars is service. Everyone from server to food runner was extremely kind. The lady at the front also bussed and cleaned tables.. In heels y'all. (You go girl!!)   Anyways if you're in the area I highly recommend.",

After reading on the website that the owner is nicknamed \"The Princess,\" I was lucky enough to meet her and talk about the restaurant. You won't meet a nicer person!  We had a great time here and look forward to going back. Many people order takeout, but I find their dining room very comfortable.   Although they offer many of the Americanised Chinese dishes, like General Tso, I encourage you to try the many authentic selections.",

We arrived at 6 on a Saturday to a completely empty restaurant, which we should have taken as a sign. I got Szechuan Beef, which turned out to be bland, overly sweet and not at all spicy. The fried rice was oily, cold and dried out. My wife ordered MaPo Tofu and it was so salty, she chugged all the water on the table trying to rinse her mouth. The kids' lo mein was inoffensive bland basic noodles.   I noticed another reviewer pointed out that most of the pictures were uploaded by the owner.

    "text": "This is a disappointment. I was excited to try this place as there are only a few authentic Taiwanese restaurant in the area. But after trying it out, I don't think this is even close to authentic as the other options in Pittsburgh. I had the wonton in chili oil and the chicken steak over rice. Both of these are the easy, basic but tasty dish from each cuisine(they claim to be Taiwanese and Szechuan cuisine).  The wonton came out first, but it was super salty and the filling didn't taste fresh. I would say 2 out of 5. Not a good start. After a little bit, the chicken steak was ready. Nice presentation! It came with some boiled pok choy on the side. First impression of this dish was authentic. Soon I found out that the chicken steak was weird, thickness wise. I've never had chicken steak in my life that was like this. I'm not saying it has to be like a prefect steak. But this is way off. Some parts were half inch thick, which turned out to be the best part, they were juicy but there were only 2-3 pieces like that. Then there are some ones were like paper thin which of course it would be over fried and too dry. So I think the chef defiantly need make some changes on this.   The taste were alright, the chicken itself doesn't have any flavor, it is solely rely on the seasoning powder, but the powder only covers the top chicken. So, I had some plain fried chicken. At least it came with pork gravy over rice, that was pretty good.   So,  overall, It didn't live up my expectation. Lot of room to grow. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is interested in authentic Taiwanese or Szechuan experience.   I noticed that a lot of the pictures were uploaded by the owner, I think it is a great way to get people's attention for a new restaurant, but for a place that has been open for few years, this is a little misleading when people are not paying close attention to the title/wording of the pictures.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for dinner on a weeknight.  Ordered the woodear mushroom appetizer, the stewed pork belly over rice, and stir fried watercress.  Total came out to a little under $30 without tip.  What's Hot - Quality.  Delish!  Cali girl here who grew up with home made Chinese food.  I've also eaten the real stuff overseas.  Trust me, dudes, I know!  The food was absolutely delicious and flavorful.  The stewed pork belly was tender and melt in your mouth.  The flavor/marinade was absorbed in the belly fat, which melted in my mouth.  The woodear mushroom was well seasoned with sesame oil, raw minced garlic, and chili oil.  Flavorful, not too spicy but had a kick, and crunchy yet tender.  The stir fried watercress had a good amount of sliced garlic on it and it was not overly salty, which is super important, because the freshness and flavor weren't masked.  Good quality Chinese food is hard to find, especially when it comes to certain dishes.    - Layout.  There are booths and tables that can accommodate groups.  From what I could see, their largest table probably accommodates 8 people.  I came by myself after work, bringing work with me.  They sat me at a booth, which allowed me to spread out my work. - Menu.  Not Asian fusion, which is something I appreciate.  Good variety, especially when it comes to Taiwanese dishes.  Many of the dishes on the menu are not common dishes, such as woodear mushroom, za jian mian, pork belly dishes, tendon, etc...  Their menu is also written in Chinese, which I appreciate.  Their staff and much of their clientele are native Chinese speakers, as well.  No offense, dudes, but in my experience eating at ethnic restaurants, the best ones are when the staff speak the language and personally know and eat the dishes.     - Location.  Convenient location surrounded by other shops and restaurants.  It's in a conveniently located plaza with a large parking lot, which is helpful.  However, I'm certain that also means that this place could get busy during \"rush hour\".  So, be prepared. - Service.  I came by myself and brought work with me, so I was eating and working at the same time.  However, the wait staff didn't push me.  It helped that the restaurant wasn't crowded, but that they didn't push me out was still appreciated.  What's Not - Price.  The stewed pork belly over rice is $6, but the stir fried watercress is $13.  That surprised me.  My total tab was around $30 for 3 dishes, which seemed a bit high.  To be fair, fresh produce is more expensive.  On the other hand, you are paying for good quality.   - Portions.  I was surprised the pork belly over rice was as small as it was.  For $6, it wasn't that bad.  However, it looked like the portions at this restaurant are not so much family size.  If you come in a group, be prepared to order more food to feed everyone. - Service.  After I paid my bill, they pretty much left me alone.  They didn't refill my water glass or anything.  I've been in restaurants where we stick around after paying the bill, but the wait staff will still check in and refill water glasses.  That I didn't get that bummed me out.  Just goes to show that every restaurant is different.    Final Answer Definitely plan on coming back.",

The pork in my dish was well executed: tender. The side of rice was OK, but not particularly fragrant or lightly toothy as the short grains I prefer. The veggies in the dish were classicly undercooked, which I find offputting. Nevertheless, the dish was tasty and well balanced in sweetness, acidity, and fat.",

I wan wanted to try the pork shank, but I was warned it was a huge portion and I wasn't mega hungry.  I went with the hot and soup as an app and the beef noodle soup as the main course.  The hot and sour soup was different, as all authentic places have there own flavor, yet very good.  The broth of the beef noodle soup was it's highlight, very flavorful.  I plan on coming often.",

It's soooo tasty!!!!!! Price is fair, service is good, and food is offered fast!  I love the beef with hot pepper more than the Zhajiang noodle but both are decent. Lunch menu is okay portion, but if you order from the regular menu, food portion is huge! I think it is definitely worth a drive up here! Will come back soon!",

Ting's is located in a shopping plaza, so parking was easy.  I immediately connected with the warm and inviting dining area.  Definitely a nice option if one is looking for a relaxing environment.   The menu was easy to read, even though it was a bit extensive. The staff was very friendly, and we were given plenty of time to review our options.  Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was nicely prepared. It was not over-cooked, nor was it swimming in oil. Serving portions were plentiful.   Nicely done Ting's.  Based on this experience, I place my checkmark in the recommend column.",
