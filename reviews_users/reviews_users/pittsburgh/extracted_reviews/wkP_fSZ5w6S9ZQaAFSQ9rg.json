I initially went to Atria's b/c of all the hype and then I realized something, it's all hype - there is no substance to the hype.  The food was blah, the atmosphere was blah, the service was blah.  Maybe \"Meh\" isn't the right word - let's go with \"Blah\" for Atria's.    There are so many places in and around Pittsburgh that are so much better so do yourself a favor and try one of those other places!",

We also often come for special occasions with a larger group and they are also very accommodating - sweet to our children, quick to refill drinks and kind to those in our parties who prefer the first floor. As for the food nearly everything we have had is great. Burger is amazing! Pot roast nachos - can't go wrong! Crab Bisque is delicious. And if you have a chance to go for Octoberfest the Bavarian Cheese Soup & Pretzels are a MUST try. Great local spot. Love, love love!",

    "text": "\"Quality food at at an affordable price,\" I think not! My recent experience at Atria's was rather disappointing.  The positives: I called to make reservations for 3 at 6:30 and was able to get in at 8pm last Friday night. When we arrived, they were able to accomodate us outside on the patio which was nice since it was such a beautiful evening. The Oktoberfest menu had a large selection of german food including apps, entrees and desserts.   The negatives: The food. Although the menu seems to have a diverse selection of options, I was disappointed in the quality of the food, especially for the price. Our table started with the baked pretzel appetizer with mustard dipping sauce off of the Oktoberfest menu. The pretzels tasted like generic frozen pretzels I could buy at giant eagle. Nothing exciting there. I then ordered the chopped salad which was the only highlight of the meal as it was exactly as described on the menu and had a full days worth of veggies. For my entree, I ordered the bourbon glazed pot roast with vegetable gravy and red skin smashed potatoes. Although the bourbon added a nice sweetness to the pot roast, I wasn't able to fully enjoy the flavor due to the fact that my 3 peices of pot roast were 80% fat. Yes, I understand that pot roast is a fattier cut of beef. However, I do expect to be able to eat at least half of what I am served. I was thoroughly enjoying the red skin smashed potaties until I bit into a full clove of garlic. Don't get me wrong, I eat enough garlic to keep the Robert Pattinson's away but, I don't eat it raw or in whole cloves. In addition, the vegetable gravy was more of a soup that the pot roast and potatoes sat in. My dining companions were also not impressed with their meals. The Maine bay scallops were presented in a glorious fashion but fell short of taming a manly appetite. Three medium-large scallops and a side of rice for $20 is a bit excessive to me.   The in betweens: Service. Although the server was friendly and accommodating, the food took quite some time to arrive and was barely warm.  All in all, even though we were intrigued by the Oktoberfest menus, I probably won't be going back to Atria's anytime in the near future.",

You could wait at the bar, but its not that big & usually full. When you enter,  You immediately see a staircase that leads you to the upstairs. The food is good. I do like their famous pot roast nachos, but sometimes they can be a little soggy. The North Shore location at PNC Park has a better set-up in my opinion. However, if you're in the neighborhood, it's not a bad place to grab a bite to eat.",

    "text": "I'm surprised this place has gotten \"meh\" & \"blah\" reviews. Our experience today was much different. (Only drawback for me being that there is only 1 vegetarian menu option for lunch)      Our waitress Allison, said she was new, but did a great job! Always quick with coffee re-fills but not overbearing. As it was our first time there, one of the chef's, Larry, personally delivered a free bruschetta to the table. He introduced himself, was very polite letting us know if we needed anything we could just ask for it. After the brushetta, we had the Quatro Formaggio Dip and Kevin had Clam Chowder. This was delicious, but probably not a great idea to split between two people before an entree. We ate half, and had half boxed up to save room.      For entree's I had Tomato Vodka Florentine and hubby had the Bleu Cheese Burger. He didn't read the menu closely & he was a little disappointed it wasn't actually bleu cheese, just bleu cheese dressing (as per the menu), but he said it still tasted good. Larry, the chef, delivered our entree's, and was again very polite and warm. We sat and drank coffee for awhile after dinner, not feeling rushed to leave. At the end of our meal, the owner came around to again check on how we enjoyed our meal. I found the customer service here to be superb.      This is the original Atria's location, and the inside is kept to look like the inside of an old but well kept house. We had a great table on the third floor next to the window.",

    "text": "I've been going to this place for 15ish years.  The service has gone down hill consistently year after year for the past probably 5 years.  We keep going back because we still have this idea of what it used to be and we think it'll just one day miraculously go back to the way it was.  Well, last week's  visit will have us moving on to wishing for other, maybe more important, miracles because this one ain't happening.  Our food came out staggered.  My wife's when it finally came out was wrong.  All she ordered was a salad with lettuce and steak.  Nothing else.  And they got it wrong.  They gave her a little over half the normal dinner portion salad and the steak was cooked to the depths of the equator and back.  When we nicely told the person who came to our table because the waitress was nowhere to be found they got a manager.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but the waitress when she mosied on over days later never even mentioned it.  Also, the drinks... The water glasses sat empty on our table for over 30 minutes.  I worked in a ton of restaurants and bussed tables at both upscale and bar type restaurants.  Water glasses get filled as top priority.  Always.  It's so frustrating because this place used to be awesome.  Now, the people working there think they can get by on the restaurants past reputation instead of living up to the standards that once made it great.  With all these new foodie type restaurants coming up Atria's will be lucky to last unless they make serious changes.  Starting with the back of the house and server attitudes.",

    "text": "This is a good local chain with about 7 locations.  I believe this is the first one and I used to stop here more often when I kept an office in the area.  I was there last week with some guys I used to work with and since we were getting the \"band back together\" we decided to hit up this South Hills institution because we were an institution of sorts years ago.  We got there at about 930 PM last Tuesday.  This is an immediate plus because many non major chain restaurants don't serve food past 9 or 10 PM during the weekdays in the burbs'.  The kitchen is open here until 11 PM.  The space itself is pretty cool.  It very much has a local watering hole feel to it.  They have valets that work during the dinner rush to park your car promptly with a smile.  In the Summer they have a patio area that is perfect for al fresco dining.  The interior itself is homely with dark wood, moderate lighting and the decorations on the walls are authentic and not the mass produced types at tj mcfunsters.  There is seating in both upstairs and downstairs and it is cozy while still providing privace from the table next to you.  On Tuesday we all sat at the bar and there was a pretty packed bar (surprising on a winter tuesday for most places, but I'd guess not this place), but all 5 of us were able to eventually get a seat.  The patrons were young and old, suits and jeans and for the most part friendly even though it was clear initially we weren't part of the usual clique'.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it is solid 3 star dining a step above olive garden and casual chain and not quite fine dining.   They had guiness on tap with always warms my heart.  The wine selection was decent and reasonably priced.  I was able to get a couple pours of a decent red malbec for under $10 per glass.  My buddies were able to find a few okay scotches to choose from and I think they had glenlivet and glenfiddich I think up to 24 yr. old.  The bartender, sarah I believe was very good, attentive and friendly.  This is the kind of bartender that makes it easy to grab a burger and a beer by yourself at a bar.  I started with a cup of the sherry crab bisque, which was a lot better than the last I had here.  It was thick and creamy without being too thick.  It also had noticeable chunks of crab.  I then had the chedder burger which was a big burger on a warm perfectly toasted bun oozing with cheese, however I wasn't asked how I would like it prepared so it was a little overcooked for my tastes.   I substituted asparagus for fries for $.50 more.  The asparagus were tiny and not that good, but I guess it's not the season.  Mike had the seared ahi tuna which was pretty good and better quality than I would have expected.  I think Trevor, Lloyd and Rob literally ordered everything on the appetizer menu.  I tried one of the caribbean shrimp which was a pretty good not overcooked large shrimp with tasty coconut breading.  They also had the mini burgers, pot roast nachos (pretty good I'd suggest trying), fromage dip (forgettable) and a few other things.  All in all a good neighborhood place that is a local franchise and worth your time if you are looking for an alternative to the mega chains.",

It was evident that she had  already given our reservation away (as we could see the computer) but she didn't own up to it. 6:40, hostess says they're clearing tables upstairs for our space. Ok. 6:45, still waiting. Manager shows up. Says patrons just left on the lower floor and that he'll personally push tables together for our reservation. We agree. While standing outside I watched him clear one of these tables, work on getting the legs level for 30 seconds, and then abandon all hope. This was the last time that we saw the manager all night. No follow up later on. 6:55, watch two servers finish pushing the tables together and laying down the table dressing. 6:58, we're seated. No menus or silverware. Server comes out. Her name is Lynda. She immediately notices this and rectifies the problem. Lynda worked hard all night. She deserves a better working environment. 7:10, order taken. 7:45, apps show up over an hour from the initial reservation. 8:33, meal finally arrives 1.5 hours after the initial order was taken. The food is ok. It's warm and I've had worse, but I've also had a lot better at this same location a year ago. 8:53, paid the bill. No dessert as we would likely have had to spend the night. Total was $155 and my parents intended to pay as it was my birthday (plus they had a gift card). I insisted on paying in full. We compromised and I paid $105 after applying the gift card. Left $20 solely for Lynda. Hope she finds a better employer if she plans on staying in this line of service.  We won't be back. The kicker is that we'd had a near identical experience during the past Octoberfest. We thought that it was a fluke. Shame on us. Our general observation from watching the servers, manager, and patrons is that this place panders to regulars while ignoring customers that would otherwise repeat. What happens when the regulars are gone?  Don't waste your time.",

    "text": "Our first time at the Atria's on Beverly Road was a success!! the complementary fried zucchini (because it was our first visit) was, I think THE BEST I have ever tasted and we loved the condiments served with it. My hubby's fried cod was very good as were his fries - both served very warm and tasty. My southwest salad was awesome; however, the tortilla bowl was a bit on the not-so-crispy side, so I just removed it. Our waitress, Lynda, was excellent. She even brought me the salsa on the side because I mentioned I didn't care for raw onions, and she let me put it on my on pace. If/When we go again, we will ask for Lynda. The menu looks like it has something for everyone and all the customers were smiling and appeared happy. You can tell a lot about a place by the emotions of the customers!! Thanks,",

    "text": "I love Atria's. I came here for lunch with my girlfriend on a quiet weekday afternoon, and even though every other person there was pushing 80 years old, I still felt like the place had a young and fresh vibe. I don't understand, did the retirement home send a bus over or something? I guess I'll never know.  To start off we both ordered a cup of the House soup specialty at the time, Crab Bisque. The cream based Crab bisque was amazing, I even though about licking the bowel after finishing it was so good. The soup had a proper amount of crab meat in it and had an amazing sherry enthused aftertaste.   My girlfriend decided to go all Americana and go with a Cheeseburger, while I chose to dabble with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. She loved her burger, and ate every last drop of it, which is definitely a rarity because she hardly ever entirely finishes her meal. My chicken had a delightfully thin breading, that seemed to match harmoniously with the linguine and marinara.   I definitely want to go back to Atria's and experience their dinner scene, as I was totally impressed by my lunch.",

The door was opened for my friend and I, we were promptly seared and warmly greeted by every employee we came into contact with. The dining room we were taken to was awkwardly small and w one larger table in there was as loud as the bar. And slightly less comfortable. Our server was very attentive w many personal suggestions which were helpful. The food was quite good, was not a fan of the garlic vinaigrette, which the server has recommended. However my friend and I ate every course, and every bite! Lol. Idk what they put in the whipped butter they serve w the bread but it is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised with th quality and freshness of the Ahi, which I had for my main course. My friend said his burger reminded him of his grandmothers, exactly what he wanted. Prices are middle of the road, reasonable. We will be back and especially in the warm weather to enjoy the patio seating.",

In fact they even come with a chipotle sour cream. I have had a couple if their pasta dishes and a couple if their salads and they did not disappoint. Prices compare to Applebee's or Chili's but the food is fresh and of better quality. There is an open view to the kitchen so you can see the chef and the assistants prepare the meals. The environment is welcoming-being slightly low lit. The decor is contemporary with a mix of lights and darks. The wait staff is outstanding. They not only wait on their own tables but woks an empty dish off your table if they see one. The servers know their menu and have nice recommendations as to what to order if needed. I recommend saving room for carrot cake!",

    "text": "We drive past Atria's every day, yet the reviews somehow held us away. On a whim, we decided to go to Atria's for Valentine's day. Yikes, poor move. I'm pretty easy, I can get down with the dollar menu at McDonalds. However, I am familiar and experienced with casual, casual fine dining. and upper end fine dining. On to the impressions:  Immediately pulled into the parking lot to see a truck heading straight for me. I squeezed between people standing in the snow and the vehicle coming towards me. I asked the valet if there was a separate entrance, but he assured me that I came in the correct way - the reason it is mandatory valet only. Sadly, the Valet was one of the high points of the night. We walk in to a friendly host, whom told us about the history of the restaurant while we waited - very nice. He also recommended informing our waiter that it was our first time for a free app - again, nice touch. The place looked like a cool spot to grab a drink or two... not a good meal. Upon being seated for the rest of our \"dinner\" my impressions were confirmed.  We were seated in a booth in the bar room next to the kitchen exit. Not what I would expect with a reservation, esp without being asked, but sure. I immediately informed out waiter that we would have the coursed \"Sweetheart Dinner\" - Cocktail, Salad, Surf and Turf, and Dessert. After a few minutes our cocktail arrived a Kir Royal. Not a bad drink, but nothing special. As our drinks came out, the Chef brought out a free App - Fried Zucchini - my favorite part of the meal. The salads came out fairly quickly, which was also pretty good.  We waited with empty plates for some time, while employees walked past us, not bothering to clear our plates for about 10 minutes.  Now the fun began - After waiting for quite some time without food or drinks - a major no, no with a coursed meal - our food came out. The touted steaks were about 3-4 ounces and burnt black. I asked for mine medium rare and my date asked for medium well. Mine was generously described as medium well (grey with light pink center) and my date's was not edible (burnt and charred exterior with a fully grey and tough interior). Both of our mini steaks tasted like ash. The lobster was like rubber... awful impression to leave for a date that had never had lobster (Had to promise to make the meal myself or go somewhere reputable soon). To my server's credit, I was eventually able to flag him down and get the steaks replaced with properly cooked ones, though equally miniature. Between the horrible food, slow service, we mercifully were able to flag down our server, and get our dessert boxed and check to go. The damage for the \"sweetheart dinner\" - two cocktails, a good side salad, an awful tiny \"filet\" and terrible lobster (I've never said terrible and lobster together :/ ), and two additional drinks (Captain Diet and a Beer) 110 (130 inc tip). We most definitely wont be back. Seriously, I wish I took pictures, this was a comically bad experience.",

Sangria was really good.  Bartender was very friendly.  Once we were seated upstairs we were greeted by the Manager then introduced to the waiter.  They were very accommodating.  Allowing us to order at 4:00 then bring our food hot and ready at 5:00.  I ordered the Salmon and it was very good.  Nice size portion with jasmine rice.  Well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The others all commented that they enjoyed their food too.  The chef came out to see if we were happy and talked for a few minutes about the food.  Very nice touch.  First time I was ever at this location, they told me it is the original.  I liked it very much and would definitely return.",

I've lived in Maryland and I've had some amazing crab cakes. Atrias were hands down the best I've had in a while, if not ever! The chicken Marsala, ribs and tilapia were great as well (that's what others in my party had). To top it off we had the largest piece of carrot cake I've ever seen! It literally came out in a pasta bowl. The chef also delivered our meal, and came out again to check on us and all the tables to see how our meals were. They were packed too. When was the last time a chef asked you how your meal was?! What a great dining experience. So happy this place is right down the street. Well done Atrias and chef John!! Thanks again",

What a huge mistake. We arrived on time, 9 pm, and were seated immediately. Our drink order was taken and we were informed of the menu items no longer available and that they close at 10pm.  Our drinks arrived at 9:20, but they were not busy. I knew why when our calamari appetizer arrived, eight pieces of calamari on a big plated of hot peppers. Honestly embarrassing they would actually serve it. Overall it was my sorry mistake to have selected Atria's. With so many new restaurant choices available I won't be back.",

I sent an e-mail to their website about all of my experiences & praising the Pleasant Hills Location. I received an e-mail back from the manager of the Mt. Lebanon location requesting that I call him. We spoke for about 20 minutes & I explained what it was about this location that I didn't like. He was nice enough to invited my wife & I down for a visit.  They more than made up for any issues I had. The service was great. I had the Char Grilled Meatloaf & it was terrific.

    "text": "So unbelievably disappointing. After living in Pittsburgh my entire life and never having been to Atria's, when my folks suggested we dine there, I was excited to make my pilgrimage. I'd heard so many good things about this place. Guys... Are you sure you meant THIS place? Our dinner was so painfully subpar that I finally registered as a Yelp user to warn you all.  I should have known what I was in for upon seeing the interior. No place to wait. Awkwardly tiny. Super dated. And, not in a charming, kitschy way. Whatever, though. I can overlook decor. I'm not here for the view.  Our service was pretty unmemorable. Well, until the end... We'll get there.   My food was inexcusably bad. I'm no Gordon Ramsay and I could have made everything I had much better at home for half the price. The rice served with my meal was cooked to mush. But, bonus, it was also slightly crunchy and burned in spots! The green beans were so overcooked that they were falling apart before my fork even came in contact. And my \"seafood trio\" (that they had the audacity to charge TWENTY THREE dollars for) was so, so sad. I feel really badly for the fish that had to die to become this meal. The crab cake was the only semi-redeeming part of the meal, but being that it was literally bite-sized, my enthusiasm faded pretty quickly. The salmon (I'd estimate about 1.5-2 oz at most) was overcooked and tough. And the grilled shrimp? There were 3 of them. And they were smaller than cocktail shrimp. Also overcooked. I'll give Atria's credit for consistency, though, as nothing that I put in my mouth that night had any seasoning on it. Surely there must be some wiggle room in the budget to purchase some salt and pepper?  As I sat and marinated in the mediocrity of my night, the server stared at our table every time she walked by, making it painfully obvious that we were to leave, now. (I worked in the business for a long time. We weren't camping. We'd paid the bill all of 5 minutes prior. It was unnecessary.)   tl;dr: Yep. Never again. Overcooked. Underseasoned. Overpriced. Underportioned. But, hey, free valet!",

    "text": "Came here for Easter brunch yesterday.  This was my 2nd visit to this location (the first was over a year ago.)  I want to point out that we all came prepared to be patient, because I know that holidays like this are hectic for restaurants. We were running late for our Easter brunch reservation, because our car got blocked in at the church parking lot. I called and let them know and they were understanding. When we arrived (15 minutes after our original reservation), the first person we spoke to made it sound like we were supposed to be seated in the upstairs dining room.  Instead, when we were finally seated (2 adults, 1 kid, 1 baby) we were seated in the back room on the 1st floor right next to the bathroom. It was fine - relatively quiet back there, but I get the feeling this is where families with small kids tend to be seated. I also got the feeling that we may have had a table on the 2nd floor, but missed out because we were late.  Our server was great, I'm sorry I can't remember her name. Our youngest has a dairy allergy and she instructed the kitchen to not add butter to the slider buns, etc, but they did it anyway, and she promptly had the buns replaced when I pointed it out to her.  I appreciated that.  Our oldest was happy with his kids grilled cheese & fries.  Our toddler ate some of the bun, but didn't like his plain sliders (I tried them - they must have had a rub on them - they were very salty! Please don't do this to kids' food items!)   I had the bananas foster french toast. The actual bread/french toast part was great; however it was so overly sweet, I had to stop eating it. My husband ate one of the pieces as his desert. The description says \"...with caramelized bananas, whipped cream and candied pecans served with bacon\". It was actually very few slices of banana drowning in caramel sauce (not the same thing as \"caramelized\"!) With 2 greasy, limp pieces of bacon. Bananas are SO inexpensive - please be a bit more generous with them!  If I'd known it was like that, I would have asked for the caramel on the side. My husband ate the pot roast hash, which came with a surprise potato pancake (pleasant surprise, though not included in the description). He said that the flavors of the hash, etc. didn't make any sense (I'll leave that open to interpretation). Once he mushed everything up together and put some ketchup on it, he said it tasted better. So, overall, our experience was fine, service was good, valet service good, but the food  was \"meh\" for us, unfortunately. And, for the prices, I'd expect better.",

The manager did make this right and our would be $80 dollar bill was it in half.  The other problem are the servers, though friendly they are terribly slow, and aren't overly professional in that I've always had to ask for what the soups and specials are.

If I had any critique it would be about the crab soup...high on flavor, but where was the crab?",

    "text": "I tried to have a casual dinner here Saturday evening.  The only positive thing I can write is the valet was very friendly!   We had a reservation but that didn't matter.  We sat at the bar for over 15 minutes where the bartender gave us the wrong drinks then ignored us as we tried to get correct drinks.  I had to remind the hostess that we still had not been seated after we watched people without reservations get seated as they walked in the door.  We were finally seated at a tiny table by the kitchen.  Keep in mind that the restaurant was by no means crowded.  Our waiter took our drink and dinner orders.  He brought us soup then never returned to our table.  The soup was very good, so that was a plus (soup and valet!).   We never received water, or the drinks we ordered from the waiter.  We never received the food we ordered.  After 45 minutes, we left. Got up and walked right out.  A manager followed us outside but never apologized for the horrible service or huge wait time.   From the hostess to the manager, everyone we encountered Saturday night was horrible.  The hostess could not be bothered to greet us then forgot about us, and we had a reservation arriving prior to that time.  The bartender gave us whatever drinks she wanted to, then left the bar area.  Our waiter, after taking our orders, attended to his other tables and did not even bring us 2 glasses of water.  The manager, admitting to the long food check time, dismissed our complaint.  The place is not worth the time it takes to make a reservation.  They will ignore it anyway!  I will, however, wave to the valet as I drive by to some other place!",

She is a pretty picky eater who would much prefer a super burger from eat n' park than going to any fancy restaurant. Atria's was a good happy medium. The staff was so wonderful. Before even knowing that there was a birthday at the table, the manager came over with complimentary fried zucchini. I'm not big on fried foods but these were good. Even better because they were free. I didn't order an appetizer because of the free treats given to us by the manager but I did give into the advertisement of their crab cakes being the best in town. The crab cakes came with a parmesan risotto and grilled asparagus. I don't eat crab cakes a lot but I would imagine that the advertisement wasn't far from True. They were amazing! It was an extremely pleasant and surprising experience and my mom had a great birthday!",

The fa Diablo was amazing and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too. Hope to visit again and sit out on the patio for dinner.  Overall, a very good dinner and for $60 for 2 it was a great price.",

    "text": "I have to admit that I'm not a die-hard Atria's fan. I can't be, because Atria's tends to go back and forth for me - at least, this location does.   On the one hand, I've had really good meals here. Octoberfest at Atria's, for example, is pretty darn delicious. The specials offered then are flat-out tasty - filling, carb-tastic and quite heavy, but definitely tasty! Similarly, the drinks I've ordered and the time I've spent at the bar section with friends have also been equally enjoyable.  But I've also had bad meals here that I simply can't forget about - particularly ones that were cooked with so much grease and sauce that my food literally fell apart in my hands or fell off of my silverware. I particularly remember this happening once with a burger I'd ordered. I admit, this was many years ago now, so in the interest of fairness, perhaps it's not a common issue anymore.  But the following is still a common issue: the parking lot. You have to let the staff park your car - resulting in a lag time as they look for a car they're much less familiar with than you are. And getting out is simply a nightmare as the exit connects to the road literally in the middle of a bend, just past a light. So drive with caution when leaving. Seriously. The people in a rush to get home and whipping around that bend are themselves enough to scare me away from eating here often, truthfully.  So yeah, this is not a go-to eatery for me. It's a nice place to dine in October for sure - and I'll stop in if someone has a coupon or invites me. But I admittedly don't go out of my way to dine here. Still, I do stop in periodically, so I guess that's what counts. 'Til next time, guys - because let's be honest, there will be a next time!",

Also know that their website is outdated and there are certain items are not available anymore so have back ups ready.    We ordered on a Sunday around 430, we wanted The Rocks (not available), Southwest Chicken salad (not available), a Pacific Salmon salad (available), two Steak Salads (not available*), and Blueberry cheesecake (available).  The not available items were still on the menu on the website, which is supposedly being updated as this is a test restaurant for a new menu.  Picked up the order and brought it home only to find out the cheesecake was not in the bag.  Mind you, the place was dead.  Only several tables were seated.  I should've checked, this was my fault.  We called the restaurant and they comped us for the cost.  When we opened up all of the food we felt jipped.  *They \"created\" two $15 steak salad for us since they forgot to tell us it was no longer on the menu.  They used half a steak and a side salad per creation.  Both of the Salads combined equalled my Salmon salad.  There was no way these salads were worth $15 each.  Speaking of my salad, the Salmon was dried out and burnt.  They also gave us chili with our zucchini sticks instead of sauce.  (BTW, their chili is on the sweeter side)  When we called the restaurant back we spoke to the manager.  She comped us for the entire meal which was very fair and nice of her.  Just be sure to check everything in your order before leaving, right down to the salad dressing (which was also incorrect).",

We were sat in a small room directly to the right of the entrance and that really should be reserved for larger parties. It was completely awkward sitting in there with one loud table and just us two. Our service, including the hostess, and the food was nothing special. Bread for our dinner came out before our appetizer. Their pasta entrees don't include a salad or even a veggie side which is a little strange, imo. The spinach florentine and chicken parm were just eh. I think the best part of our dinner was the valet, he got us right out of there which is what we needed.",

We ordered 2 entrees to shared. Father's Day Filet Kabob with grilled veg. My friend ordered it medium. I prefer rare or medium rare but to my surprise it was delicious, very tender and tasty. I will be ordering a steak next time. And the Spicy Shrimp De Frivola with stuffed banana peppers. Penne pasta with just enough spicy kick. Was delicious.

Hubby ordered the pork chop and asked for it well done ( served raw in the middle) and my fish was awful ( thin and bought, I'm assuming, prebreaded.) I own a restaurant where our fish is hand breaded..the difference is like daylight and dark. Our server, who I'm hoping was new, didn't know the menu nor wines at all.

We were really surprised when we were seated immediately since the restaurant was very busy. Once seated we waited approximately 20 minutes before someone even asked if anyone was taking care of us. The waitress looked very frazzled. We started by ordering drinks, iced tea and a club soda with lemon. The waitress forgot the lemon for the club soda. Next we ordered our dinners. My husband and I ordered the  bourbon braised pot roast served over mashed potatoes and our friend ordered chicken parmigiana. The dinners came with either soup or salad. Our friend ordered potato soup, but the waitress brought crab soup. She never brought the bread and butter that she said she would, another waitress got it for us once we asked. The dinners came out and the waitress tells us they are all out of mashed potatoes, would we like a baked potato instead. Not sure why she waited until the dinners came out to tell us. We were disappointed that she told us so late in the order.The pot roast was tender, but a little burnt with very little gravy and vegetables. It certainly lacked something without the mashed potatoes. The baked potato that she brought was way over cooked and we had to wait 5 minutes after she served our dinners, plus she forgot to bring the sour cream.  Our friend said his chicken parmigiana was fine. There did not seem to be any communication between the cook staff and the waitress. Even though you are busy it's no excuse for sub par food and service.",

    "text": "The best part of the dinner was being able to sit outside. Our server was pleasant, but not very knowledgeable about the menu. She did not know what the catch of the day was nor if the ahi tuna salad was served on a bed of lettuce. (It does not come on a bed of lettuce...it is basically served with a side of cucumber.)  The tuna was requested rare and it was way overdone. The Reuben sandwich was the worst. The meat was super thick and bread was soggy. The meat should be thinly sliced and the bread should hold for the duration of the meal. The fries were decent. The blue cheese dressing was delicious. Also ordered the pot roast nachos...where was the pot roast? I felt like they barely put any meat on the nachos in order to save money or something. I've been to Atria's before and had much better experience, but this was pretty bad. Unsure if I would be willing to go back any time soon.",

    "text": "I *love* this place!  I recommend using Open Table or calling for a reservation ahead of time because this place gets PACKED.  Somehow I can always get a reservation right away, but without a reservation there's a wait.  They have a really nice outdoor patio that I like in the warmer months.  In the colder months its indoors, and the building used to be an old hotel.  It feels like an old building.  Its a nice restaurant but it does look a little bit dated upstairs with the green stripes on the walls.  BUT---are you here to check out the decor or are you here to EAT?  I effing love Atria's food.  It's probably so unhealthy but I don't care.  Why is it so good?  How???  I strongly recommend the Miso Glazed salmon, the meatloaf, the pot roast, the goat cheese ravioli and their reuben's are to die for.  Literally you might die, bc they are so tasty they've got to be FULL of butter.  No one ever ate a reuben for their health.  The pot roast nacho's are OUTSTANDING.  In fact ,any time I want to get my Dad to come to Atria's with me, I don't ask if he wants to go to Atria's, I ask if he is in the mood for Pot Roast Nachos.  Turns out, Dad's always in the mood for pot roast nachos.  The only thing on the menu I don't recommend are the fish tacos.  I had them on Saturday and they were just not excellent.  Still tasty though!  The service is outstanding.  Our waitress this past Saturday was Daya and she was so pleasant that we'll ask for her section when we come back.  They have a killer cocktail list too, the Blood Orange martini tastes like angels squeezed it from golden oranges in heaven.  ???  Ok, I don't know what that meant, it is just a damn good martini.  Also, I spent my formative childhood years in Stuttgart, Germany.  Their Oktoberfest menu is HANDS DOWN the most authentic, best tasting German food in Pittsburgh.  I get asked where to get the best German food all the time.  It's at Atria's, during their woefully limited Oktoberfest menu.  The Chicken Paprika is ...  AUSGEZIECHNET.  WUNDER BAR.  Really effing good.    Everyone in Pittsburgh eats at Atria's, but if you havent yet, you really should make a reservation!",

    "text": "This place was actually a house and I love it.  It's up scale yet homie and the service is more then kind.  Me and my beau went during happy hour, which is only downstairs but our waitress let us sit upstairs away from the crowd.  Appetizers were half priced along with most alcohol.   We started with my beau's favorite Calamari and I ordered grilled vegetables. One word, perfect. Both were light and pleasant and didn't fill us up to to much. The portion size was def. enough for more then just the 2 of us but remember the Calmari was his FAVORITE. I ordered a moscato along with it while he had a simple beer.   For dinner I had the waitress pick for me while my beau tried the Chicken Fresco.  The Chicken Fresco came with their homemade marinara and a balsamic glaze.  Not impressed, to plain for me but I grew up eating nothing but ethnic and flavor riched food.  The beau thought the same.  I was surprised with the Tri Tortellini and was happy. The pinenuts gave this plate exactly what it needed but it's nothing I couldn't make at home.   The wait was a bit long for dinner because of our waitress and chef miscommunicating and we ended up with a free dessert!   We picked the strawberry wontons. When it came out the plate looked so pretty!!! But not with three wontons and a scoop of ice cream... Def a dessert for one not two. Needless to say it was very very good. I can say this dish was the best part of the experience.   Overall, 4 out of 5 because the flavors are for people who are used to that style of cooking... I come from an ethnic family so flavors are a big deal to me!  - Dating Kay",

    "text": "Atria's is currently running its Oktoberfest promotion, something I wasn't aware of considering this was my first trip to any of its franchises. How ironic is it that my first Atria's experience happened to be at THE first Atria's, the one founded 82 years ago?   Kay and I have whizzed by what I'll refer to as Atria's Prime far too many times to be forgiven, especially considering that we've resided in its zip code for well over a year. Some weekend errands that took us up and down this South Hills corridor left us with excuses no more. We had to lunch here.   A chipper lad acted as a valet, parking the Kaymobile safely. I doubt the other chain-ish Atria's offer this, but do not allow it to put you off if you're worried about dining casually at a casual price point. Our t-shirts and jeans were not frowned upon at the least, and my wallet wasn't left gasping when it came time to settle up.   A hostess led us to an upstairs dining room that overlooked bustling Beverly Road. From the looks of Atria's Prime's exterior and interior, I felt as if I had been invited to a Thanksgiving dinner as the guest of a wealthy relative I didn't know. And in these Victorian-ish environs...I just felt like a burger. In spite of Oktoberfest, and the not entirely common dishes being offered for a limited time,  I required nothing more than a burger.   Kay's enthusiasm over the special menu did little to dissuade me. Even tasting her splendid Sauerbraten entree, luscious braised beef, doughy, nutty spaetzle, tangy cabbage and all, failed to fill me with envy.   I was too into that burger, man.   Every Atria's has one burger on their bill of fare: The Award Winning Cheddar Burger.   This bull of a burger carries with it no fancy or out-of-the-box accoutrements. Mayonnaise, mustard, coins of sour pickle, shredded lettuce, tomato, and onion are all that come with it, and they are placed neatly UNDERNEATH the cheddar-robed patty (not only does this prevent a mess, but it also keeps the bottom half of the burger bun cool), which in my case was ordered medium-rare, something their chef achieved with the steaming, gushing precision of a champion grillmaster. The bun glistens with butter. The most perfectly actualized housemade potato chips, sliced longways, THE ideal way, come with (or fries or cole slaw if you must...blah) this unassuming masterpiece (I asked for a ramekin of  their fresh buttermilk ranch dressing to dip the chips in and was a very thankful I did so).   What? They're selling soft pretzel sticks and bratwurst this month and next you're telling me?   Kay insisted on starting with the salted bread batons, and I thought I was at Olive Garden. Not that I hate the OG or their breadsticks, but they lacked sufficient chew factor to make them memorable. Docile is how I'd describe them. With spaghetti and a salad is the only way I'd have them again.   The bratwurst was brought to our table on a complimentary basis to commemorate our first visit by the chef himself, his forehead happily beading water like a car's windshield in a rainstorm. That he ran upstairs to give us some of the German sausage in gravy for free and speak with us for a moment was heartwarming. Kay loved the bratwurst. I thought it to be a tad bland and rubbery, but I won't gripe about it much since I felt honored to have sampled it at no cost.   Hungry minds can be kindred. Hence our simultaneous decision to have the Black Forest Cherry Cake for dessert. Each cornerstone of vicious,delicious, maliciously moist cake was filled with a tart, grisly cherry compote, and iced with a cadaver-white, cocoa shaving-laced buttercream frosting. Chocolate sauce outlined the body, a tuft of maraschino cherry-garnished whipped cream to held off some of the depravity, and a snowfall of powdered sugar to reminded us of dark days to come. A more fitting cake to celebrate the Season of the Witch there isn't.   To paraphrase the Atria's motto, it ain't bad to eat here.   P.S. Our good-humored waitress Kimberly provided nimble, top-notch service.",

    "text": "This location has a charming ambience, as it is located in a rather old building.  Went there for lunch, and had an okay meal.   Started with the soup- it was their Oktoberfest cheese soup. I swear I ordered a cup, but received (and was charged for) a bowl.  It was fine, though it would've been nice if it were served with bread.  For my entree I had the parmesan crusted tilapia, served with a side of pasta.  The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente, and the sauce was tasty (though applied sparingly).  The fish had a very nice, crisp crust. Unfortunately it utterly lacked seasoning (including salt). A cardinal sin of the kitchen.  Service was friendly, but absent minded. I was offered freshly grated parmesan, but the server had to go get it. By the time she found her way back to the table, some time later, I was already halfway through my lunch.  Though I was only dining with one companion, she couldn't recall who got what dish.  Warning- the parking is valet-only.  They do not charge for the valet, but, of course, you are expected to tip. This isn't something most people expect when dining in the suburbs, so make sure you have a few ones on you.",

    "text": "Visited Atria's for a pharmacy organization dinner recently and was excited to try it out - being from PGH (specifically the South Hills), I've always heard about Atria's but have never visited. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in my experience.  We were in the upstairs private room, which itself was lovely - a lot of natural light, but the space was a tiny bit crammed for all of us. The stairs getting up to the room were very narrow, which isn't a problem for 24-year-old me, but may be an issue for older folk. We mingled a little bit and had a small intro for our \"program\" for the night before eating, but then when we did start to settle in, the waitstaff was absent nearly the entire night. My dad brought a bottle of wine for our family to share (corkage fee $10), but it was very difficult to get the attention of any of the servers to bring us glasses and open our bottle for us - it wasn't until we had our main course in front of us and were starting to eat that we had the bottle opened and poured. In terms of food, it is hard to truly evaluate since we had a buffet for dinner - never truly as good as ordering off the menu. The salad was one of the highlights - full of fresh red onion, tomatoes, and cucumbers with the option to throw on egg and bacon as well. The buffet included penne pasta with marinara sauce, which was overly sweet and lacked a little bit of cheese on it - the dish was also not kept hot, making it less desirable as well. Roasted veggies were the highlight of the hot foods, consisting of a nice combination of zucchini, yellow squash, red peppers, and red onion with a simple yet flavorful spice profile (likely just S&P, but very tasty) - I loaded up on these. Lastly for me, I had the grilled chicken, which was pretty standard - one piece of mine was a little dry, but other than that, nothing too much to write home about, just a standard chicken breast. There were also \"smashed\" potatoes on the buffet, which I did not try but heard were OK as well. After dinner, we had requested some coffee to accompany our dessert, and the waitstaff seemed a little confused - they brought out a few cups, but then wound up setting up a coffee station for us all to enjoy. This was a great gesture, but the regular coffee ran out almost instantaneously and was not replenished for the night :( For dessert, we had a tray of assorted mini treats, including petit fours, mini cheesecake bites, and chocolate chip cookies. I had one mini cheesecake with choco chips on it and one plain one, which were both tasty, but again (and this was the theme of the night), nothing overly exciting and honestly tasted like some of the mini desserts you can get at Costco or Sam's Club.   At the end of the day, my experience at the OG Atria's was a little sad. I will give the caveat that experiences with a group of people and with a buffet are hard to extrapolate to the actual dining experience, so I would be interested to order off their menu to get a better idea of the restaurant's offerings and service. However, wouldn't make visiting Atria's again a high priority during my next visit to PGH.",

I also had a cup of the Sherry Crab Bisque.  It was just ok..hardly any crab at all.  All and all the lunch was NOT worth the $32 I paid with iced tea, taxes and tip...not even close.  The waitress was friendly and not overbearing.  She fixed an incorrect order at another table pretty fast. Unfortunately, they were freezing as they were seated right by the front door and every time it opened a cold blast of air hit them.  Since the room was empty, I'm not sure why they were seated there.  The waitress should have kept the door to room closed.  Unfortunately because the food was not great, I don't plan on heading back there anytime soon.",

    "text": "Went to Atria's Friday evening after work (Friday, 7/26/19 @ 5:30pm), to have an enjoyable dinner/evening with a friend. Reservation's were made ahead of time.  Atria's always changing menu left us limited as to what we ordered. I opted for the $14 chicken salad, vs the $16 steak salad (last order of the steak salad was a search for a reasonable amount of steak, to justify the cost). The salad was served in a generous size bowl, with mostly all lettuce, and a scant of chicken (I counted 3 strips) and pineapple (5 small cubes), and a few tomatoes and tortilla strips sprinkled throughout.   After finishing our dinner, my friend ordered dessert ($7.99 carrot cake) and we both ordered coffee. The coffee was brought out lukewarm, at best.   While we were enjoying our evening out, the server came over and dropped off our checks. I really didn't pay attention to the fact that she never asked if we wanted anything else, but thought perhaps her shift was ending (the restaurant was almost empty downstairs).   We were quite shocked when the server asked us to complete our credit card tabs, and leave the restaurant! I looked at her and said \"excuse me\"? The server went on to say \"you will have to leave now, we have a reservation that needs this booth\". I mentioned to the server that there were several booths on the 1st floor that were empty, as the tables never filled back up after the 1st seating. I asked our server if the guests drinking/dining seated in the booth next to us, were also asked to leave. The server looked at me and walked away.   I have been a patron of Atria's for over 20+ years. I can assure you that I will not return. Just a short drive up the street are much better choices than this particular Atria's Restaurant. I frequented Atria's (Mt. Lebanon)  more as a location convenience when meeting friends from my former neighborhood.   Atria's (Mt. Lebanon) has lost quality and appearance over the past years, and their lack of competency to fill their restaurant beyond a one fill per night, shows. The food is mediocre, on a good day. In my opinion, the food is heavy, tasteless, seemingly unhealthy, and overpriced.  One extra booth will be empty, as we will not be returning.",

    "text": "Great food! I got the chicken parm and the portion was so big I ended up sharing it with my boyfriend. My only problem was that the service was a little on the slow side. It took the waitress what felt like 30 min to finally come over and get us our check. And it's not like she was far away, she was working in the bar which was like 10 feet from our table, chatting with other customers instead of checking on us. Other than that, great place for a nice dinner! Not too loud and the food was excellent!",

I ordered the fish tacos, and my friend ordered the steak with gouda mac n' cheese. The fish tacos were very flavorful with a nice slaw and sauce on the fish. The fish did have that fishy aftertaste which I was not a fan of. The portion was good though for the price: three hearty tacos, rice, and beans. My friend said her steak and mac n' cheese were delicious and she was very satisfied.   Overall, a decent restaurant for some classic dishes. Nothing though super memorable, so I don't know if I would come back.",

The service was delightful and our particular server was very kind. The food arrived quickly, but the order was incorrect. NO big deal and the server rectified that as quickly as possible though it left one of us eating solo on Valentine's Day (cue the violins). On the second try, my salad arrived with frozen lettuce. I didn't have the time or the desire to send it back yet again and that thoroughly put me off, so I gave up and took it home to await the thaw. The salmon on top was fair, as was my date's (who ordered a different) salmon, but we both left underwhelmed.",

The restaurant is always very clean and the staff is always welcoming and friendly. Atrias has a small classics menu, but all their dishes are very good!

Ordered the chicken paprikash off the Octoberfest menu - the sauce was too thick almost like a BBQ sauce- not a fan- the spaetzel was overdone and rubbery. Hubby's Greek salad with Mediterranean grilled chicken was drowning in dressing that was too sweet. Service was slow and it didn't seem too busy.  Wish the food was better because it's so close - will most likely never be back",

The staff was very friendly and asked where we wished to be seated. I let her choose since she had surgery recently so we ended up on the main floor.  The first thing we noticed was the place was very cold. We had wondered if they left the air conditioning on from the previous day. They were offering Italian specials so my friend opted for the eggplant Parmesan and salad. I decided to take the vegetable salad with chicken along with a cup of wedding soup. Although it took a long time to receive our food it was quite good.  I thought the presentation of the salad with the triangular shaped pita bread was marvelous. it wasn't overfilling.  Later on we both used the restroom only to find it was bone chilling cold and although clean in a deplorable state of disrepair. I really thought that a place like this that offers free valet parking would have nicer appearance. The first floor was fair in appearance and had a full bar. We sat at a booth.  However, the staff was attentive to our needs and will return as we see fit.",
