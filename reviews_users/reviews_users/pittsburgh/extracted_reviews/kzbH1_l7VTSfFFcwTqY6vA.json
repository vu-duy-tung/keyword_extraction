The server makes or breaks a restaurant and she was outstanding. The food could not have been better.  Like having dinner at a True Italian grandmother's. The bruschetta is the best in the City. The bread and oil are amazing, little touches that really set Sarafinos apart.  The quality is first rate and it is presented beautifully.  Be prepared for a crowded atmosphere- but that's part of the charm.  Go. You'll love it.",

BYOB allowed us to have a decent bottle of wine without a huge markup.  Its really small, and pretty noisy as everyone is essentially in one small room. (Hint:sit outside if you can). Not noisy bad, noisy like a big Italian family having dinner. Dont expect a quiet date night, (especially if you get stuck sitting next to the drunken, shrill harpie behind our table).  Perfect if you are going out to celebrate!",

Portions have gotten smaller but price is the same.  Almond cake, evil good. Open 11a - 930pm (fri/sat 1030pm) CLOSED SUNDAY. Saturday opens at 4pm.  I hate crowds and long waits, so if your like me, here are some tips. I  go on Mon,Tue,Wed nights anytime or Thurs, Fri/Sat night i go super early like 4-5pm. Lunch i go at 11am or wait until 2pm.  I avoid lunchtime between 12noon -130pm because sometimes there are no tables at all or get your food to go. In the summer they have outdoor seating, but its blazing hot. The owners Dad (RIP) gave me alot of good tips about where to buy a house on the west end, because some areas only had volunteer FD, and brookline/beechview old sewer lines, etc...LONG STORY, LOL.",

Sarafino's is very non-assuming from the exterior, and the delicious hefty-sized portion home-made dishes make it a True neighborhood gem. In addition to a bottle of wine (only a $5 cork fee), we split the special marinara mussels appetizer, polenta appetizer, special crab cake entree, and Della's Spring Diavolo (with the gnocchi substituted in place of the rotini). They were all delicious, but my favorite dish was probably the mussels appetizer because I've never had them prepared that way before and they were so flavorful. Two thumbs way up - I will be returning soon!",

The ceiling is bowed from what looks like water damage, and it looks like they attempted to paint it, but didn't like the color, so they stopped after one row. Maybe that has some history or cute story, but as a first time customer, I wouldn't know.   The service was ok...not too timely, but not neglectful.   We ordered the special muscles appetizer - good. Too much salt, but good. No comparison to Il Pizzaiolo.   The main dishes were also specials; I had the homemade cheese ravioli and my husband had the pasta svoglio with red clam sauce. The ravioli wasn't much to write home about. The pasta they use is really thick for ravioli. The sauce was ok.  The pasta svoglio was better. Lots of seafood used in this dish, and I enjoyed the taste I stole.   I don't think we'll return here before we try another Italian bistro, but it was worth a try.",

The crabcakes are totally phenomenal...they rally for the top spot against any seafood restaraunt. Totally crab, no filling. The bread....yum! Fresh pasta and ingredients. The waitstaff run and work HARD and the owners are so fun, accomodating...with their GIANT presence! If I was pressed to find any fault, it would definitely be the lack of AC or any circulating air on a summer's evening inside. It is oppressive, something a few ceiling fans might help.  We have melted thru a few dinners recently and think we may save this for fall/winter/early spring dining.  It's very cozy in the winter. The few outside tables under an awning are awesome but the summer sun does set out there. Otherwise, totally YUM!!!!",

The waitstaff kept going into a curtained off area just beside our table to get supplies. The coffee was in a huge carafe. The atmosphere just wasn't pretty and cozy as it should have been with such a tiny place.   The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. I'm not sure if go specifically to Crafton for this place.",

My wife had a vegetarian sandwich with a side salad and after the hot bread and salad, well let's just say the sandwich had to be taken home! I had a veal over pasta and it was delicious!

He was throwing F'bombs around and was yelling I mean YELLING at the one server who was on duty about tickets getting messed up. She was mortified and almost in tears when she brought us our soup. I told her to tell him we would never ever give him a dime of our money again and we left her 100% tip.  I have never witnessed an employee being treated with such disrespect in plain sight of customers.  I hope people remember this is how this owner treats his employees and will keep this in mind when they decide if they want to give him their money.  It was appalling!",

It is very small inside but each table looked like they were thoroughly enjoying themselves. The chef waved to me as I walked in! I got take out and it was ready within 10 minutes! Nice..  I ordered the grilled chicken Panini ($7.95)... the selling point was the combo of roasted red peppers, banana peppers, and provolone with the house dressing... mmmm!  It said it came with a side salad... to my surprise it was a side of PASTA salad.. even better!  So my sandwich wasn't so much a Panini.... the bread they use isn't really pressed down as I thought it would be... unless there are different cultural norms for how one makes a Panini? Regardless, the sandwich was amazing. So was the pasta salad. Garlicky goodness!   I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "What a great little place! As someone who appreciates a fabulous, homemade Italian meal, I loved Sarafino's! Chris and I have lived a few minutes away from here for a couple of years and people always asked if we came here (because they loved it). We finally got around to checking it out at the last minute on Saturday night.   Since it was a Saturday night, I called beforehand to see if there was any chance we could put our name on the list to be seated earlier. The woman on the phone informed me that we needed to come in because she had a \"laundry list\" of names. We had nothing else to do that night so we still went and put our name on the list. The hostess let us know that we could go to the bar next door while we waited and they would let us know when our table was ready. After about 45 minutes, we received the phone call and we were seated at a small table in the corner. The inside of Sarafino's is very very tiny and large groups of people seemed to be the majority of customers that night. My ONLY complaint is when we were seated the waitress didn't come to our table for about 25-30 minutes- not even for water. When she finally noticed that we had not been taken care of, she was very nice and was apologetic about the wait and quickly brought us water and bread & dipping oil.  Once I tried the bread and oil, I knew this place was going to be amazing. The bread was fresh and the oil was addicting. We decided to start off with their famous greens & beans- if I'm being honest, this isn't something I would ever order and I wasn't super excited about it. OMG-- I was wrong. This dish was super flavorful and unique from anything I have ever had! Chris and I basically licked the bowl clean! For our entrees, it was almost impossible to pick- everything literally sounded mouthwatering to me. We ended up ordering pizza & pasta to split... AKA loading up on carbs... we were at an Italian restaurant after all! We chose a small pizza with peperoni & hot banana peppers and the Sarafino's pasta dish. The pizza came out first and was the perfect size for splitting with someone! It had an amazing thin crust and I loved every bite I took. I also loved the Sarafino's pasta dish. The roasted red pepper sauce was different from any other sauce I have had. It also had chicken & mushrooms mixed in it. Another plus of Sarafino's is their servings are huge- we even had enough to bring a decent amount of leftovers home... which is very rare for us!  My ultimate test of an Italian restaurant is if my 100% Italian \"I only eat authentic food\" Father would enjoy it.. and there is no doubt he would love it here. I look forward to coming back and maybe giving a 5!",

The fresh bread and dipping oil was the great start to the meal. We both ordered off of the special menu, I had veal parmesan and he ordered the wild boar ragu. Both meals were delicious! We shared a tiramisu and almond cream cake for dessert. I'd eat there every day if I could! Definitely a new favorite.",

We were told by one very rude server to wait outside and someone would be with us. After 20 minutes when my son asked again he was literally yelled at by another server as she was pointing her finger in his face and was told they weren't ready to seat us and we needed to wait. I have been in the business for 40 years and go out to eat a minimum of 5 times a week. I would never treat someone that way and will never go back!",

    "text": "A restaurant would do better to extend an offer of \"better service next time\" to customers who were less than pleased with their business rather than post insults and threats in response.  After particularly horrible service at this restaurant (now over two months ago) I posted a small review blurb to my instagram account which revolves around food, recipes, etc. Usually I stick to positive reviews but between bad, bad service, health violations and multiple other problems, it was a review that needed to be written. (None of these reasons had anything to do with the taste of the food mind you, as I indicated in my review, we decided to leave before ever having a chance to order a main course-about an hour after being seated-we begrudgingly ate our appetizer and salads we had ordered before the long wait of being ignored by our waitress as she served, checked on, and cleared plates from other tables-we didn't really care what the food tasted like at that point, we just wanted to leave and go have dinner elsewhere.) The end.  Skip to over two months later, a harassing, insulting, bullying and outright threatening comment was posted on the photo/review on my instagram account by someone (yung_bernie), seemingly suggesting they work there? by the comment \"my restaurant.\" Both the comment and the user were reported to instagram.  Simply nothing in response, or even better, \"We hope you'll give us another chance to serve you better,\" or something along those lines, which I've seen other companies do when given bad reviews-justly or unjustly-wouldn't have convinced me to go back, but it would have gone a long way towards \"customer service\" rather than a f-you. And the last line in the overtly insulting instagram comment threatened that if I ever came back they would put me in their \"gourmet pizza ovens.\" Don't worry, I would never have returned to this place anyway.  What kind of restaurant is it that gets upset at someone for having a bad experience and speaking up? Simply horrible.",

That's the only reason I gave it four stars.  It could have been a five.  Food was fantastic.  Great alfredo and red sauces.  The crab cakes were suggested over and over but we found them to be dry. The HUGE Portobello mushroom that came with the crab cakes was pretty spectacular. We all basically licked the herb oil plate clean that came with our bread. I think we got three of those.   I had Sarafino's Pasta and I couldn't get enough in my stomach. My youngest son ordered Gnocchi with Alfredo and chicken, which I frowned upon. Then loved it. What a great combination - who knew?  Couldn't eat another bite, so I took Tiramisu home with me. It didn't make it. It wasn't the best that I ever had but it was slightly sweet and a great end to my meal.  I really can't wait to go back. I have a feeling it will be a little better. Owner was present and greeted everyone.  He walked around, talked to patrons, laughed and had genuine concern about the food.  NICE!!",

It's a nice corner restaurant that used to be a pharmacy (so I'm told).  Not a spacious dining area, but good for 6 or less at a table.  The smell from the kitchen is strong...  garlicky and wonderful.  The bread was fresh, crusty and disappeared fast.  I had the wedding soup which was pretty different, as I believe it had basil as the greens and no chicken.  Delicious and unique.  Two of us ordered the special which was an alfredo and roasted brussel sprout pasta dish.  Mind you, I was excited to see an Italian steak salad that DID NOT include the typlical 'Burgh French fries - but the brussel sprout pasta changed my mind and it was so good.  So WAY good.  Hubs, being the traditionalist that he is, ordered the red Bolognese with a meatball and a sausage - he was pretty happy, also.  Friend #2 ordered the house crab cakes, which she knew from previous visits were fabulous and they were pretty lovely, gotta say.  We split the almond dessert - yummy and we should've got it TO GO as we were TOO FULL!  The place is noisy and it doesn't take much for it to be crowded, but dang...  the menu has some items that definitely need to be explored further!  Be hungry when you get there--",

I appreciate that the offerings are purposely prepared in a straight-forward manner, and not made with 11,000 ingredients--just old world Italian cooking is all.   I had the special for the evening--two crab cakes with a house salad and a healthy-sized portobello mushroom. Those crab cakes were so much better than anything I have gotten in the Chesapeake Bay area in quite some time; they were light and lovely and delectable.  My hub had the linguine and white clam sauce; I tried it--it was to die for.  A highly-pleasing cappuccino for an after-dinner treat was only $2.95? Say what?!  As if it couldn't get any better, when owner Joe Caliguire was making the rounds in the dining room and found out that we hailed from the nation's capital, he comped us free dessert. We got the tiramisu cake and almond creme horn, and were they smooth, smooth, smooth, baby!  This is a peach of restaurant. I should have bussed Mr. Caliguire on the cheek, but demurred.  I coulda given the wrong impression and then got the local people gossipin' and all that, since I never met the man before.  No wonder he got restaurateur of the year awhile back. He understands both food and people, and how to treat them very well.  Pittsburgh--you are lucky and I am jealous.",

When I notified our waitress, she didn't seem to be very affected by it, and just said \"oh sorry\" and brought me another iced tea. I laughed and just asked for water. I'm sure it came from the same pitcher the dead fly was floating around in. As a waitress myself, I would have been overly apologetic if that happened to one of my guests. I also would have notified the manager and had someone come to the table. Disgusting. Will not be returning.  Oh- and to add to it, the other person I was withs order came our wrong. Most likely because the server didn't care to write our order down. If your memory skills suck maybe you should take notes.  What a joke!",

If I had to leave after the bread and dipping oil I would have been ridiculously happy. The bread came out piping hot and the dipping oil was better than anything I've ever had.   We ordered soup which came out right away and was tasty. Our meals came out only a few minutes after we finished our soup and we were not disappointed! I got the Rita pasta and my husband had the Sarafino pasta, both of which were incredible!   We felt out of place because we were the only table in the restaurant without a bottle (or two) of wine!

While the decor of the place is very dated it has the feel of going to your grandma's house, and the food to match. I mean the food was exquisite! I had the scolioli (sic) special, the mussels in white sauce for an appetizer and my wife had the vodka pasta (The Rita?) and my boys split the meatballs & marinara. All of which were some of the best Ive ever had. The were extremely accommodating to my boys and served the food in a way that kept the kids occupied. And the bread was hands down the best bread ive ever had at a Italian restaurant which is a serious statement. Also, Pirates ex-manager and World Series winner Jim Leyland was at the table next to us and couldnt have been nicer! An overall great experience!!",

    "text": "This being my first review, and the fact that I am a \"self-proclaimed\" expert on the Pittsburgh dining scene, I find it ironic that Sarafino's will be the first restaurant that I write about. I say this because I have eaten at just about every high profile restaurant in and around the city and the last place I would have expected to find such a hidden gem would be in Crafton. No disrespect to all you Craftonites, or Craftoners, or whatever you call yourselves. The real irony of my writing this is that after haven eaten so many amazing meals at places like Eleven, Bona Terra, Davio, Alla Famiglia and Bistro 19, this little hole in the wall was so good that I only now decided to sign up on Yelp to tell all of Pittsburgh about Sarafino's.  GFOJC (girlfriend of JC, thanks Munch) had heard about this tiny BYOB through her colleagues and we finally decided to go last Friday night to check it out (they don't take reservations). One of the best signs of a good spot is seeing  customers waiting outside and sure enough there were plenty of hungry patrons standing out front on a rainy Friday evening. We enter tiny Sarafino's to find a casual, narrow space with a noisy open kitchen and white paper-covered tables??  I counted 44 seats with 2 or 3 tables able to accomodate parties of 6 or more.  There is no bar except a small little counter area where you can open your bottle of vino while you wait if you're lucky enough to snag one of the 3 or 4 bar stools. We decided to wait outside and chatted with a few of Sarafino's friendly regulars. We asked them what they recommended and of course their answer was \"everything is good.\" They all seemed to talk about their famous Fried Ravioli app, the Greens & Beans and their pizzas. Consider me a skeptic. We were 1 or 2 parties away from being seated so we ventured inside to check on our table status. While we waited for them to clear our table, one of the waitstaff dropped a complimentary plate, no a mountain of the aforementioned Fried Raviolis for the group of salivating patrons seated at the counter. I quickly moved in to get my piece of this fried pie which was drizzled with their almost-famous tomato cream sauce. I put 2 ravioli on a plate and quickly took a bite, looked at my dining companion, and smiled. She took a bite and smiled back.  I know what you're thinking.  Fried Ravioli, come on, how good could they be?? They were amazing!  Gently fried to perfection, plump, tender and full of sweet cream ricotta and the sauce is sweet and tangy.  Wow, if this was a precursor of things to come we were in for a treat.   We were finally seated in the corner, handed our menus and had my bottle of 2005 Poggionotte Nero d' Avola (highly recommended under $20) opened. The menu is small but with plenty of options and 4 or 5 nightly specials.  My lady ordered a menu staple called the Rita , which was Penne in tomato cream sauce with pancetta and onions and a little red pepper heat. Having enjoyed the Fried Ravioli so much, I decided to order the Cheese Ravioli entree special but asked if I could have the delicious tomato cream sauce instead of their homemade marinara. Our waitress assured me the chef would be happy to oblige. We also decided on the Hot Polenta app instead of the good-looking Bruschetta that had goat cheese, pancetta and sun-dried tomatoes. The table next to us were devouring it but we didn't want bread overkill since already at our table was this fresh-out-of-the-oven Mancini-looking small loaf of bread. The accompanying garlicky olive oil is delicious and the bread was so soft and warm. So far so good at Sarafino's.  Next out came the simple mixed green salad (a la carte) with a very good Italian vinaigrette, onions, tomatoes and crumbled blue cheese. It may have looked simple but it was very good. While eating my salad our appetizer comes out (my biggest restaurant pet peeve) in this giant bowl of soft polenta with a pool of marinara and parm cheese on top. Earlier I mentioned the \"mountain\" of ravioli on the appetizer, well the giant appetizer portions is a recurring theme here. After having barely put a dent in our 1/2 gallon of delicious creamy Polenta, our entrees arrived. Both were outstanding and pastas were cooked perfectly al dente. I am a sucker for good ravioli, two of my favorites being at Gran Canal Cafe and Legume's butternut squash ravioli, but I would put Sarafino's right there with the best of them. The Rita was very good and lucky for me there were plenty of leftovers.  Again, the homemade ravioli were perfectly cooked, filled with sweet ricotta cheese in a pool of that delicious sauce. We can easily be talked into dessert and coffee and boy were we glad we didn't pass on the delicious toasted almond cake.   Pricing is very reasonable with our entire bill being about $50 for what was a wonderful meal at a wonderful restaurant. To make a long story short, I know it's probably too late, but have I mentioned that I really enjoyed Sarafino's?",

We got the white clam sauce, red clam sauce, and Veal Parmesan - all three were delicious and we all had leftovers. I highly recommend the restaurant and will go back.  Also, they have a small lot on the side of the restaurant, but we saw it as we were passing it, so we just parked on the street. Plenty of street parking, too. The restaurant is very small, so getting there early is probably a good idea. I'm not sure if they take reservations.  (My dad went to the rest room and that is upstairs and apparently pretty far away, so not good for someone who can't walk too well.)  It is BYOB with a $5 corkage fee (even for a twist cap that requires no opener), which is a bit much especially since they don't sell alcohol, so it's not like you're trying to cheat them out of business, but their soda is insanely cheap, so if anyone isn't drinking alcohol it's a bargain. They didn't give us a bag for our leftovers, which was a problem when it was placed on the back seat and we got oil all over everything, since they just have the styrofoam containers that don't seal, so you might want to ask for a bag and/or hold your leftovers VERY carefully on the way home. There will be leftovers. Tons of food.",

It is an all Italian restaurant where you can order most any type of pasta, pizza, and paninis. They have vegetarian options as well. Stopping here for lunch with my daughter I was debating about ordering the wedding soup but realized that with my panini and pasta salad that would be a little too much to eat.  My chicken panini was made cooked to order. The pasta salad was fresh. I simply enjoyed my meal. My daughter ordered a 10 inch cheese and mushroom pizza. You can also order it in 16 inch size as well. She ate the whole thing and loved it. The also offer appetizers and main courses if you are so inclined.  Located on East Crafton Ave near the borough building parking may be a bit difficult since there is currently construction going on the nearby Noble Ave and many people parking in this vicinity to take advantage of the busway.   Open for both lunch and dinner, prices are fairly reasonable and definitely will return here on a future visit to check out their other offerings.",

    "text": "Based on reviews I thought the food would blow me away but it really didn't, and definitely wasn't good enough to make up for the attitude of nearly every employee*. We called three weeks ago and said that we had a party of 11 coming in and was wondering if they could accommodate us at 8pm before we headed to a show at 10. They told us they don't take reservations but that it was likely that we wouldn't have an issue at that time and that they would take our name. We were told to call back the day of to confirm. Okay this SOUNDS like a reservation right? We called the day of and they said they would have our table READY at 8pm. Again - this sounds like a reservation to a non-crazy person, right? We got there at 7:50 and they didn't have anything ready for us and then gave us a hard time, saying they don't take reservations and can never give a guarantee. Either take reservations or don't, that's your prerogative as an establishment and I respect it, but if you take our name, give us a time, and tell us you'll be ready then, it's a reservation whether you call it that or not. To give your paying customers a hard time when they show up is ridiculous. One of the waitresses also shoved a friend of mine out of the way while we waited and more than one employee snapped at us as we stood there trying to figure out what we would do. I've worked in the service industry for years. I have no time for establishments that don't recognize that I'm paying a high markup for their food (especially Italian which is like the cheapest food ever to make) and treat me like I'm not worth their time. As for the food, it was fine but bland. The greens and beans was probably the best thing we had. I believe they make their long pastas and gnocchis in-house, but penne and other shapes tasted boxed. Nothing spectacular and definitely not worth the lack of polite service. We won't be back.   *Our waitress was actually very nice (the only nice one in the place) and recognized our frustrations. She is the only reason this review got 3 stars instead of 2.",

Then I had pasta with bolenglese sausage tossed in too, not shabby a real homemade taste.

I would highly recommend trying the place out! I also like that it's byob because you can bring what you like! Only downside is that it is very small and crammed. I kept checking yelp to see if there was a wait and their \"live wait time\" kept ahowing 0 minutes- when we got there it was of course a 45 minute wait but definitely  worth it!",

    "text": "What a gem!  There's absolutely nothing wrong with stepping back in time and enjoying a place like Sarafino's when the food and service are still firing on all cylinders.  It feels like a neighborhood Italian joint from decades past and the food is stuck there too (in a perfect way).  It's quality, old school Italian.  The limited menu is supplemented with fresh daily specials and everything is packed with flavor and enormous.    We had a large business group come in not knowing it was a BYOB, so we hopped in the car and drove down to a state store to grab a mixed half case of good wine, which made for a fun experience in itself.    Our appetizer pizza was massive, loaded with fresh toppings and shaved cheese, and we couldn't have been happier with it.  This was served alongside the largest charcuterie plate I've ever seen.  They heaped this thing with a mountain of meats, cheeses and marinated Italian veggies....delicious.    I ordered the Scoglio (not sure on the spelling of that one) pasta special over the homemade gnocchi.  It was packed full of seafood and the red clam sauce was bursting with flavor and lots of basil.  It's one of the best Italian pasta dishes I've had in a very long time.    I wouldn't hesitate for a second to head back here with friends.  It was really refreshing to step away from the high concept restaurants, the technology and trendy spaces for a night and just hang at an old school Italian spot with simple, delicious food.  Big cities are trying to recreate old spots like this, why bother when the real thing is still here at half the price.",

I had a seafood pasta with white sauce ! It was one of the evening specials. It was very good. Everyone else ordered with  pasta with red sauce or pasta with chicken. I really enjoyed the restaurant.

It's a small place and hence a few tables are a little tight but then at times you don't mind being part of the crowd. Let's come to the food- The bread was nice and fresh and the sauce that came along with it was delicious!  The Pastas that we ordered : Sarafino's- excellent pasta . The fettuccine is probably the perfect pasta for the Sarafino. Not too heavy on the stomach and gives you the perfect mix of the Alfredo and pomodoro combined . Pasquale's : The Penne was cooked to perfection and the sauce was kind of loose ( did not mix well with the Penne) and hence it felt I was having the penne separately from the sauce . The sauce was nice though -we did add an extra side of chicken to it.  It was nice to see that the owner came out to meet a few people - seemed like there were a lot of regulars to the restaurant.",

The food is always very good, the service has remained average and the restaurant is untouched, and not in a good way. This establishment is a poster child for the, \"If it Ain't Broke, Don't Fix it\", ownership style. I understand that if you have a good customer base and they keep coming back that it's hard to justify making changes, but with so many great new restaurants coming to Pittsburgh, you better tighten up, or you'll get left behind.  For Example:   I love the outdoor seating, but the chairs and tables are awful. I'm not a real big guy, about 200lbs and I'm nervous that I'm gonna break the flimsy dollar store chair. Easy Fix.  The restaurant is tiny and cluttered. There has to be a way to open it up a little and make it feel like the guests and servers aren't right on top of one another.  The menu is old and played out. It's time to start trying some new things. Challenge your chef, he might surprise you. Keep your most popular dishes and Pizza, but give the customer something exciting.  Once again, I do really enjoy and recommend this restaurant, but if they don't start getting with the times their loyal fan base will start to fade away.",

    "text": "First time at Sarafino's. Went on a Friday night around 6pm with my two sons. I use Yelp a lot but learned to take all reviews with a grain of salt and don't often write reviews myself. But for Sarafino's; Small, filled with customers, told we'd have a 25 minute wait...and you wait, standing in a corner of the restaurant amongst servers, customers, looking into the open kitchen area. There's no bar, BYOB. Everyone is happy. The waiting area gives us a birds eye view of all the plates coming out of the kitchen...all types of pasta, short ribs over pasta, lasagna...and at the end of the meal almost everyone is asking to have a part of their meal boxed to go. We're seated in 20. Love the appetizer selection: greens & beans, polenta, all looked great but since it looked like most people couldn't finish their dinner portion, we passed on appetizers and salads. Very competent, attentive, knowledgeable waitress. We had a lot of questions about the specials, and she answered every one! One son had the special, veal parm, the largest piece of veal he'd ever seen. He loved it but could only eat 1/2 of the meal. My other son ordered the special shrimp/scallops/mussels over pasta w/white clam sauce. Two comments, the scallops were the best he had and he loved the sauce. I ordered the  Sarafino's Pasta off the menu. I would place the sauce up there with some I had in Rome, the chicken, fresh mushrooms and red peppers melted in my mouth. The pasta tasted like it was homemade. DELICIOUS. How lucky we are to have restaurants that look like little hole in the wall places, family run, but with authentic, fresh and delicious food. Sarafino's is as good as it gets, if you don't mind standing in a corner waiting for your table- the wait is well worth it!",

The pizza was nice and crisp, but overall didn't feel that the taste was anything special.

The menu was relatively inexpensive but be warned if you get any of the special they are double the cost of most entrees, but the portions are huge. We started with the greens and beans- a classic dish which was good but I probably wouldn't order it again since it wasn't anything particularly special. Next I had the Sea Bass Piccata and my husband had the pasta scioligio special.  Both dishes were very tasty but if we returned I would probably stick with the regular menu. It is a byob which is nice a new winery cellar just opened up down the street so we ended up checking out the grand opening. In the future it would be fun to go to the winery first and pick out a bottle to enjoy for dinner.",

Even the complementary bread was noteworthy. It's not made in house, but they toast it prior to serving it with the most delicious olive oil/tomato basil based dip.  For our appetizers, we went for the famed greens & beans which was both hearty and flavorful. I especially liked the addition of the spicy sausage. We also ordered the mussels in marinara (special). Holy cow, I couldn't believe just how many mussels were delivered! They weren't particularly large, but that marinara sauce was to die for delicious!  For entrees, we shared the veal parm, sea bass pasta, and crab cakes. Hands down, the sea bass pasta won. It was seared nicely yielding delicious, buttery, flakey fish over perfect al dente pasta. The crab cakes were also phenomenal. It was nearly all crab actually - a crab loaf, if you will. The Portobello mushroom on the side was also grilled nicely. The salad was a little forgettable and I wasn't a fan of the horseradish sauce. Our heaviest entree was definitely the veal parm, but it was still good. The breading wasn't too thick and the veal was fried nicely.   We definitely had no room for dessert this time.",

    "text": "I LOVE Sarafino's!  They are BYOB and might be my most favorite place to eat Italian food.  Every time we come here (which is a lot) anything we order is always so delicious and perfectly seasoned AND the portions are so huge I almost always have leftovers for the next day.   The servers are friendly and awesome - Daisy, Melissa and the newest addition Tonya - love all 3.  They all make us feel welcome and right at home there and we love coming to see them.    Food wise, for starters we usually get the beans and greens but lately we've been getting the polenta - which is stick to your ribs delicious-especially when it's cold outside.  For dinner, my usual is the Rita's, switch out the penne with gnocchis and add meatballs - which I always say I'll get something different but never do because I love it so much.  However, we went on a Friday during lent so I had to find something else. What's great is they always have seafood/fish specials so I ended up getting the pasta scoglio in a red clam sauce - and wowee wow wow-  did I love it!  It was full of flavor and chock full of mussels and shrimp and scallops - every bite had a delicious bit of seafood-I was in love.  Hubby got the Chilean sea bass special - which was out of this world.  Honestly, everything we get here is so tasty you can't go wrong with anything you order - highly recommend trying this off the beaten track place - we absolutely love it.    Ps I loved my dish but was so sad I didn't get my usual so when my sister wanted to come here for her birthday the next night I was thrilled to say - sure it's your birthday, whatever you want.   :-) guess what I ordered?",

However you also can't go wrong with their pizzas or salads. The cherry on top to this mom and pop shop is that they can accommodate large parties, which make it great for family gatherings and celebrations. I could not recommend this place more!",

Food is pretty good Italian fare (which is why I'm not giving it one star) but is certainly not worth it for the horrendous service. I've noticed several other reviews commenting on this, and I wanted to add my experience. My husband asked for a couple of boxes, and when the waitress went to grab them, the chef/owner(?) said \"the millenial\" can wait and that she should go wait on his buddies. He asked again after waiting for ten minutes, at which point the chef leaned over and yelled \"You can wait!\" - at least the waitress had the sense to apologize to my husband! We will not be coming back, and I'll be warning everyone I know about the poor service here. The Pittsburgh area has many, many excellent Italian restaurants, and you can get comparable food without being insulted at plenty of other places. It's a shame I can't support a local one anymore.",

The bread is fantastic and is also served with oil. The food is not expensive at all, and you get plenty of it. I have never finished an entire plate.

    "text": "LOVED IT!!!!!  Great food and atmosphere.  Looking for Italian and want the romantic old school experience?  If so give Sarafino's a try.  If I lived here this would definitely be my go to spot for classic Italian. My wife and teen daughters are on a 5 day road trip and are in search for some of America's secret culinary treasures.  The second stop in our journey from Michigan found us at Sarafino's.  Based on several reviews we were optimistic that there would be something special in line for our family.  No disappointment as the menu and specials made our choices quite difficult.  Fortunately or unfortunately they were out of an ingredient necessary for the meatball sub so my wife and youngest daughter easily went with the veal.  My oldest found a pasta dish that had her initially excited, but when she heard that scallops on the specials list the idea of sharing an entree quickly became an idea that dad get the pasta and she get the seafood special.  As we had previously committed to sharing, a potential compromise was hatched and we requested that scallops be added to the pasta dish that included basil, sun dried tomatoes, feta, and pine nuts.  Our waitress quickly agreed that this would be a good addition and our food order was set.  I should mention that Sarafino's is a byo and although we were aware had made no plans to address this.  However, there is a wine cellar D&O a block away and while the girls mulled the menu I made a quick run for a bottle of red (see D&O review for a quick account of this perfect local option).  I was back before our starter of mussels arrived.  Although not my first choice (family changed the order plans during my wine run) there was no disappointment in the decision or the flavor.  the only thing that might have made it better could have been more bread to sop up the broth with (however more bread would have made the entrees less appealing because we all would have been too full to finish our amazing meal).  When our entrees arrived we were not disappointed and we enjoyed classic Italian the way it is meant to be enjoyed (sharing across the table and laughing as we discover a simple yet exceptional meal).  Sadly no dessert but when we were finished we were full and happy.  The staff at Sarafino's were great and reviews that indicated staff would rush to clear tables seemed to be inaccurate (we stayed quite a while enjoying the food and company) and we were easily one of the last groups to leave for the night.   Thanks to Sarafino's for an outstanding Italian experience!  Also, with  D&O so close no disappointment in byo as a quick taste prior to purchasing a bottle is always the best option.",

For starters this place is small I mean small and they do not take reservations so you have to go at just the right time. I wouldn't go with a large group. It was just me and my fiance and we went on a Friday night. No tables we available inside so we snagged a table outside which was great because it was a really nice night. They have about 4 or 5 tables outside right out front with a street view. This restaurant is also byob. If you forget your wine there is a local winery right up the street very conveniently located. I must mention that prices are very reasonable. Now time to talk about food! Of course you start off with delicious warm bread and dipping oil. For an appetizer we had the greens and beans which were very tasty and I'd recommend. I had a Sadie salad with the house dressing which was good and a nice size. All the portions are huge. You get your money's worth here. My fiance had the wedding soup and he enjoyed it. For entrees we both got the vodka pasta because it's our favorite and we had to give it a try here. It was excellent and we've tried a lot of vodka pasta, some of the best. The only thing that was a bit odd is when I asked for a dessert menu the waitress replied \"we don't have it on the weekends anymore\" which doesn't make sense to me because you'd think they are busier on the weekends so they'd have it. Oh well it wasn't a deal breaker. I would recommend for a good quality Italian meal and hope to go back soon!",

    "text": "What a cute authentic place! First they don't take reservations and it's byob. Come as early as you can because the place will fill up fast.  We started with the Beans & Greens as I heard they were the #1 item. It is Large portion made with sausage, onions and hot pepper rings so it is spicy! There were way to many onions in the dish and can do with out the pepper rings as it takes away from the taste But overall enjoyable.   I got one of the specials of the night, angel hair with mussels,scallops and shrimp! It was available with either red or white clam sauce. I opted for a red sauce and it was very flavorful.   Husband ordered the Sarafino's signature dish. He enjoyed it but said the chicken was a bit chewy.   The website makes this place seem a little more fancier than it is. They definitely need to improve the decor as it is outdated and looks like it hasn't been touched since the 80s   All the dishes I saw go buy were very  large and the prices are reasonable so you definitely get your money's worth! You can tell everything is homemade.   I will come back to try other items.",

It has never been too long of a wait to get in, and there's a wait because the dishes are outstanding! My family and I have come multiple times and always ordered the greens and beans, which are a great appetizer. We've also all had various pastas, from the Chilean sea bass piccata, to the veal parmigiana, pasta scoglio, crab cakes, etc. No one has EVER had a complaint on the food. You can tell it's all homemade and the flavor profile on every dish is perfect. It's BYOB, so be sure to bring your favorite wines! The cheesecake is also amazing. We love Sarafinos!",

    "text": "One taste of Sarafino's Rita's sauce may just change your life as it's changed mine! It's not your ordinary vodka cream sauce. I usually enjoy your typical vodka sauce, but the Rita's sauce is by far the best I've had. So when you come here, you have got to get that sauce with whichever pasta you enjoy. I got it with the gnocchi, which are made in-house at Sarafino's, and it was honestly one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life.   The space in the restaurant is very tight and seating is limited. Sarafino's does not take reservations and boy does it get packed. I recommend coming early, putting your name in, walking down the street to D & O Wine Cellars for a few drinks, and they'll call you when your table is ready. Just as a point of reference, my party of 4 came here around 7 on a Saturday night and the wait was 2 hours. It's worth the wait, trust me.",

The food is outstanding. And you will not find a cheaper menu. The bread and dipping oil is incredible. The appetizers are all solid. Lots of options. The pasta dishes are excellent. You can not go wrong with this place. Sure - you might stand and wait, and you might not get a server who has time to stand and chat with you, but i assure you that they bust their behinds to make you food from scratch and serve you. Probably have dined there 15-20 times and Ill keep going back as long as I'm in the area. Go see for yourself.",

I was forewarned--and shall also pass this along to others--that the wait time can be long, so you might find yourself killing time up the street at a local wine bar and waiting for a text/call that your table is ready.  The restaurant is quite cozy, warm and loud: all things that you probably look for in a decent Italian place. Also, portions are large. We split a chicken salad, a pasta dish, and a pizza, and we could barely finish the salad and bread.  We went through about half of the entrees and took the rest home, and basically rolled outta there. Next time, we'll get 2 dishes, max! Everything tasted great, and I'm looking forward to a return trip the next time we get a hankering for good Italian food and have a lot of time to kill.",

Then 2 hour waits began...and very rude waitresses. The last and final experience revolves around bringing a good friend for her birthday. We brought a cake. Also, I called ahead the day before and also requested fried artichoke. I was told a new rule was no cakes on weekends. I was told that no one paid any mind to the artichoke request. Then the food was mediocre, the service was awful (sighing, rolling eyes, no water after asking multiple times, etc.) The final straw was when my friend asked for a bag for her to-go container the waitress said 'do I look like I have a bag on me?' Done! Finished! Adios!",

It would not be handicapped friendly because it so so tight, and the restrooms are on the second floor. There is no waiting area.  We got there about 4:50 on a Friday, and it was just in the nick of time before it got crowded. We were at the table right by the door- thankfully it was a warm December night, or else we would've been freezing.   The bread is okay- VERY crusty, to the point of difficult on the teeth. The kids split a pasta entree with meatballs- they cleaned their plates. My husband had the chicken parm sandwich- the side salad that is served with it is actually a cold pasta salad served on greens. His meal was the bargain at 7.95. I had Rita's pasta, which was pretty tasty.   Service was fair- our server was one of three and they were running their butts off. The beverage glasses are small, and refills came slow (again, not a knock on the waitress- they were understaffed)All in all a solid choice, but being so small and cramped it's probably not going to be a usual hangout, but it was a solid meal and worth the trip.",

The place is very small inside and was already quite busy so we decided to eat outside because it was very warm inside with the kitchen going at full speed. After sitting outside for a little we noticed it was BYOB and they must have a lot of locals because most had a wine bottle in a carrying case.    We started off with the greens & beans which my husband especially enjoyed.  Very large portion for just two people. I tried the wedding soup which was kind of bland.  I had the pasta special with mussels, scallops & shrimp with the red sauce.  Nice portion, seafood cooked perfect, tastes great. Husband had the veal parm.  Oh my, it was a huge portion.  While he liked the veal, he didn't care for the sauce.  He said it was made with sugar and doesn't like that taste.",

Three waitresses congregated in the back area and had a conversation about Facebook and weddings and alien looking grandnephews at a volume that was so loud they should have just pulled up a chair and sat with us because I felt like I was part if the intended audience. The best part was the discussion about the one woman's first trimester and then her labor. And drink refills and seconds on bread were non-existent.  It's really too bad the help ruins the entire experience. A little service management would make this a great experience instead of a real loser.",

This is the most authentic Italian restaurant in the 'burgh reminding us of a back street in New York City stolen from a scene from The Godfather! The staff is hard working and always make us feel at home.   Being that this location is BYOB, the atmosphere is alive with locals chatting about their week and lives, etc., over their personal wine selections. The beans & greens are the best around and their pastas are outstanding! Our daughter just returned from Rome and stated that the food at Sarafino's is as close as it gets in Pittsburgh for authentic Italian cuisine. You won't leave hungry!

    "text": "Ah, back in Pittsburgh after seven years. Actually, I've been back for a few months, but hey, I had to hit all my fave spots again before I could start cranking out the reviews. You understand.  Anyway, what I really want you to know is that Sarafino's is my favorite Italian restaurant, period. They're just as excellent now as they were before I moved. Not that I was worried they'd change, but it's good to know that this place has stuck to its menu and terrific daily specials.  Sarafino's is small and cozy, and as cliched as it might sound, it feels like family. The staff are always friendly and inviting, the owner a great guy who cares about his establishment. It's always seemed like a hidden gem tucked away in Crafton, and maybe that's the best thing about it. There are a ton of Italian restaurants around Pittsburgh, and Sarafino's is in a league of its own, off the beaten path.  So what's great here? Everything I've tried. The bread that is brought to the table has the best dipping oil I've ever had. It's sweeter than other places, and one could be forgiven for filling himself up on the bread alone. But that's just for starters. The famous greens and beans are just the thing if you're looking for something on the spicier side, and the wedding soup and pasta fagioli are fantastic.  My favorite thing on the menu, though, is the gnocchi. I've never had better. It literally melts in your mouth, which is what a great gnocchi should do. It's never chewy, never tough. I always get mine in the roasted red pepper sauce (there are plenty of other sauces to choose from; they're all tasty) with meatballs. And man, I love Sarafino's meatballs. They're one of a kind, milder than others, but perfectly complement the dish, while also soaking up the flavor of the main entree.  The seared steak panini and grilled steak salad are also must-haves. And the pizza? My fave in the 'burgh! A nice, thin crispy crust with a sweet sauce base and delicious toppings of your choice. Then there are the daily specials. The crab cakes with portobella mushroom on the side are amazing. Nothing but crab meat, no filler! And if they have the lasagna, you cannot miss out on that. It will split your mind open in a revelatory fashion, I kid you not. Then there's the veal parm, the ravioli...you get the idea.  So for those of you who actually favor joints like The Olive Garden or Bucca di Beppo, knock it off. This is the real deal. Of course, those of us in the know don't mind keeping Sarafino's all to ourselves. But you'd be missing out on one of the best if you didn't stop by.",

I moaned with joy the entire time I ate it.   The service was iffy, our waitress seemed stressed as soon as she had more than two tables. She rubbed me the wrong way when she refused to let me pack up my own leftovers. She didn't seem to have enough knowledge of the menu items.   We will definitely be back though!",

The restrooms are located upstairs and are on the dumpy side.   Tonight there were several things that made my dining experience rather frustrating. The air was stuffy, it seemed like the AIr conditioning was not working well.    There was also an issue with the power. The light would dim and the bright, thus happened every minute or so. Very irritating.   The last issue was a ceiling fan that was out of balance and kept making a constant \"ticking\" noise as it wobbled.  I think some much needed building repairs would make a huge improvement.",

Unlike the restaurant in the movie, however, you can expect a good deal of loud talking... which to me is very Italian.  The restauarnt is small and the tables are right on top of each other, which makes you part of the conversation from your fellow diners.  Couple that with the BYOB policy, and you're in for some loud talking (table next to us had at least a dozen bottles of wine of the table for a party of eight!).  You have to shout a bit to be heard by your fellow diners, but that's part of the ambiance.  Aside from the noise, the food is fantastic.  I went with a party of four around 9 p.m. on a Friday and we still had to wait for a table, which is a testament to how good the food is in this place.  They have a pretty basic menu with a decent sized list of daily specials, which provides more than enough choice without being overwhelming.  Everything we tried was delicious - mussels marianara, cheese pizza and gnocchi with the gorganzola cream sauce were the standouts.    Sarafino's represents an outstanding value.  The food is well priced and the BYOB policy helps keep the cost of the meal down as well.  This is one of my new favorites in Pittsburgh - I'll definitely be back.",

One was steaming and full of gooey, cheesy, crimson, meatless rotini. The other was chilled and contained an orgy of a salad that included spinach, Garbanzo beans, onions, potent banana peppers, onions, hot sausage medallions, and copious, preposterous amounts of minced garlic.   Everything about the rotini was adequate from the soft pasta itself to the somewhat pasty sauce, but the salad--called Greens & Beans on the menu--was fiery, fragrant, and flagrantly in love with spices. Agog with this astoundingly appetizing antipasto, I simply could not stop eating it.   Luckily we have a trio of refridgerators and not everyone could finish all of the food, which meant more for us the next day and the day after that.",

You know something is going to be good when you walk in and you are only about 5 feet from the kitchen where the chef is pounding and pounding away on fresh veal!!  My wife and I love good Italian food and after Francos in Dormont closed, we were depressed.  But alas, we found a replacement...  Its a small place, but so are most of the great Italian restaurants on Mulberry St in New York City, so get over it.  The food is great, except the soup, I ordered the Pasta Fagioli, it was loaded with beans and pasta, but the broth was watery and bland, not my first choice, (that is the only reason I gave 4 stars vs 5).  BUUUUT, everything else was absolutely excellent!!  The Bruschetta was excellent which included an Italian salad in the center, Pasta with red clam sauce, Fettuccine with Oglio and grilled chicken, Veal Parmesan over linguine, and fresh bread hot out of a very, very old pizza oven with a classic oil dipping sauce...  For the quality of food and large portions, the pricing is reasonable...  If they had tables outside on the sidewalk, it would be just like Little Italy in New York!!",

Since this is an old long time place stuck to the basics and had the penne with marinara sauce..it was good.  Was able to have a few bits of the Fettuccine Alfredo which was nothing special.    BYOB was popular at many tables.",

    "text": "The food here is EXCELLENT. If you love independent neighborhood joints that stress deliciousness over decor, this is a great place for you. It has maybe 10 tables jammed into a small dining area that creates a bit of a family feel between you and other diners.   Though it is BYOB, they are happy to provide glasses and open wine bottles. There is a listing on the menu for a $5 cork fee, though my table wasn't charged for it. So if you're taking wine, put a cork screw in your pocket or purse.  As for the food, it really was quite good starting with the bread and dipping sauce. Our party of four had the signature greens and beans, a meatball panini, a linguini with red clam sauce (which my wife said was the best she's ever had), a linguini with white clam sauce, and a gluten free pasta with pomodoro sauce and everyone reported their enjoyment of their respective dishes.  Sarafino's loses stars for a situation we encountered at the end of our meal. With several parties waiting to be seated, it was clear that the head waitress was encouraging our server to get rid of us. We were never offered a desert menu, had to ask for coffees, and suffer through a clearly exasperated head waitress verbally berate our server for allowing us to order it.   While the food was out of this world, the servers must be made to realize that they are every bit as important to patrons enjoying a meal as the quality of food they serve. I will return to Sarafino's because the food was that good, but if the servers bicker openly and make me feel unwelcome again, it won't matter how good the food is, I won't be back for a third time.",
