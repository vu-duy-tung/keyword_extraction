I came in here on a Wednesday around lunch time just because I never noticed it here. The Shawarma was delicous and plentiful I almost wish that they would offer a half order and cut the price in half as well. It was a lot of food in my opinion. The host was also very friendly and answered all of my questions. The decor is a little drab but I can easily see past that. I would recommend you go check it out and let me know what you think.",

Being of Lebanese decent, growing up in a household with my Situ (grandma) authentic Lebanese cuisine is what I love and look forward to if I have a choice! Some must haves are the Kibbeh Nayyeh (raw), stuffed grape and cabbage leaves, Luban (yogurt),  Loobheh (green beans with tomatoes). You can't go wrong with the lamb,  it's always cooked to perfection as are the other selections previously mentioned. Open on Sunday NOW!!",

The Shish Kabob came with lamb that was cooked perfectly and came with rich pilaf that was flavorfull.  Noticed a few take out orders while we were dining.  This is a small place and they do take reservations.  A few couples coming in and they were told it would be one hour wait.

    "text": "Note #1: The easiest way to get here coming outbound is to cut through the Laughlin Funeral Home parking lot as you're not really allowed to make the left on Castle Shannon Boulevard onto Willow. Kabob-G Grill is hidden on a side street parallel to the trolley tracks.   Note #2: They are a BYOB establishment.   Kabob-G Grill offers what they call \"Authentic Lebanese Cuisine\" along with other Mediterranean favorites like grape leaves, Moussaka, and of course gyros. Not being able to locate a menu a few nights ago, we ordered in the dark, and got, you guessed it, gyros.  It's been a good 6 or 7 years since I've been to Kassab's on the South Side (so no review for now), but Kabob-G's gyros are similar to Kassab's in that you essentially get what is a cubed-lamb wrap being that the pita bread is thin and very tortilla-like.   It's also as big as a rolled-up newspaper, but you won't want to use it to smack a dog on the ass. No, this was an Arabic dinner encapsulated into a sandwich. Again, this lamb was cubed, not shaved, which made the gyro challenging to eat (lamb chunks fallin' out). It came with the standard veggie trio of lettuce, tomato, and onion and a sauce that may or may not have been tzatziki. The pamphlet menu I procured upon picking up our order says it comes with sour cream, but in the description for their Shawarma (comes with Filet Mignon), it says that a Sesame Tahini sauce is used, and that was what I felt I was tasting. As I said earlier, it was tough to eat at times, but the gyro was so good I minded not. One thing I'll say about cubed lamb in a gyro is that you feel as if you're getting more meat than you do when the lamb is thinly sliced, and this most certainly was filling.   The french fries that tagged along were shoestring-style and were merely blanched as opposed to fried (it's a 'Burgh thing), but the portion was generous (as was the ketchup), and overall, they were sufficient albeit average.   Their Spinach Pie was the flyaway highlight of the meal. Tangy spinach, sweet onions, lemon, assorted spices (hey, I'm no Sherlock Holmes 'aight?), and feta cheese all bandaged, mingled together and baked in a blanket of supple, smooth dough. Each pie was big as a properly folded handkerchief and as moistly ambrosial as Paula Deen's Gooey Butter Cake sans all the calories.   We also got Kabob-G's Mezza Platter which gets you Hummus, Pita bread, Baba Ghannouj, Tabbouleh (it's spelled differently at every turn!), Calamata Olives, Feta Cheese, and pickled veggies.  The Tabbouleh worked only as a palate-cleanser for me and nothing more as it was mostly parsley with scant bulgur wheat to be found.  I didn't get to try any of the Baba Ghannouj, but the hummus was pure manna. Smokey, nutty, creamy, sleek, I ate the remainder with a spoon after we ran out of bread along with the hefty tomato slice in the middle. See Gali's in Pleasant Hills for a similarly delightful hummus. Put the stuff in jars, and watch supermarkets fight to keep it in stock.   Those poor chickpeas must be crushed into near-nothingness and then be crushed again...and again. The horror!  Kabob-G Grill is a nice, friendly, family-owned establishment run by nice, friendly, family-oriented people. Keep them in the black.",

    "text": "I've always had a love/hate relationship with Kabob-G Grill, a local Lebanese restaurant a block away from my house. I've had their food about 4 times before today and it's either been really good or horrible. In once instance it almost killed me. I choked on a chewy piece of lamb and honestly thought I was a goner. Even after that traumatic experience I decided to give them another chance. Mainly because I wanted a gyro and I was already next door at my friend's tattoo shop.  The Gyro:  Luckily for me this gyro fell into the \"really good\" category. It wasn't your normal every day gyro in the slightest. The homemade pita was really thin compared to most gyros, and about twice the size. Instead of cutting the lamb into thin strips they chopped it into small chunks. The lamb was perfectly juicy and nicely seasoned. I got at least two pieces if not more in every bite that was taken. The sauce was also a lot lighter than most gyro sauce. It had a flavor that had a hint of mint in it. Also inside the gyro was lettuce, tomatoes, and perfectly sauteed onions. My only really complaint was that the lettuce could have been fresher.  The Rating:  Was it filling?: Extremely  Did I feel gross afterwards?: Yes, it was maybe a little too filling  Would I eat it again?: Yes for sure.",

I was skeptical because most of the time when I have had gyros they come with a yogurt-like sauce and the sauce served here is listed as sour cream, which was why I didn't order it. I did however order the swarma and kabob sandwiches, which are more like wraps, and they were great! The lamb was juicy and perfectly seasoned and the mushrooms exquisite. I highly recommend this place.",

We dined with some friends here this past Saturday and were overjoyed to find such delicious food! It comes very close to our SoCal spot.  Fantastic kabobs, hummus, rice pilaf and an appetizer called sleek. Sounds healthy with grains and greens, but how can something so healthy be so magnificent? Oh, don't forget the garlic sauce for the chicken tawook! Kabob G's is a hidden treasure. Don't miss out!",

Don't miss the lamb, the moussaka, the salads (with grated feta!), the rice pudding and the baklava. I would drive 6 hours for another meal at this wonderful restaurant - and will definitely do so in the future.  Do not miss this gem!!",

I've been a regular at 2 other Mediterranean places that I enjoy and they are both good but Kabob G's is my new favorite Mediterranean/Lebanese restuarant! I've tried grape leaves from multiple restaurants and stores and the ones today at Kabob G's were the best I ever had! The chicken shawarma platter and hummus was delicious! You get good sized portions for such a reasonable price. The hummus is served with warm pita bread. Kabob G's is a pretty small little restaurant located in Castle Shannon by Ice Castle and the T track. It's very nice inside and super clean! They only offer Mediterranean/lebanese food, they have no American food choices, so I wouldn't recommend to eat here if you aren't a fan of yummy ethnic food! They offer takeout as well as obviously dining in. They are open everyday except Monday's. They are open later in the evening which is nice also. Definitely will be returning to Kabob G's and I recommend it to anyone!",

You can taste the love in every dish. The baba it's outrageous with a fantastic smoky flavor. The hummus is the best around. I personally love the sleek; a perfect balance of greens, bulgar, and spices that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The salad is made by the dressing. I'm personally not a fan of iceberg lettuce but it makes the perfect vehicle to carry the house dressing...you'll want a gallon odd dressing to take home!   I still crave the falafel that was made by an Israeli family restaurant in Philadelphia where I went to school. Kabob-G comes the closest to that that I found in Pittsburgh. The tahini sauce is a little on the light side butt still good.  You have to try the moussaka; the best I've ever had. The kabobs are the bomb. The seasoning is perfect with just a little kick to get your mouth humming. My favorite is the lamb but the filet and chicken are also very good. You can't go wrong with any is them.  Seriously, do yourself a favor and go find this little gem. It's all about the food!",

The food is consistently good and the staff is always friendly and efficient on the phone and during pickup.  There are two issues I have with Kabob-G.  Recently they raised their prices. I except raises in prices as food costs rise but this was a solid several dollars on multiple meals. While Kabob-G is still affordable this was quite a shocker.  The second issue I have is with their salad. For some reason the salad is always made with multiple chinks of ice burg. Like serious chunks that you would never want in a salad. if you look past the chunks and put in the sweat equity to tear them up yourself the salad is actually quite good for a side.",

Started with a couple bowls of spinach and lentil soup with lemon. I ate mine so fast, it was so fresh and delicious. Then came the fresh, thin pita. I've never had pita this good. Perfectly warm and soft. Spinach pie for my fiancee followed. The dough was like a pillow and she loved the filling. She wished for more feta inside but it was still fantastic. Then came the falafel platter and my lamb kabob. Falafel were unique. They looked like mini donuts. Crispy exterior with a soft and well seasoned interior. A delicious array of pickled veg, tomatoes and lettuce with a flavorful tahini sauce to go with it. Just wonderful. My lamb kabob was so tender and juicy, bursting with flavor. I found myself longing for more, bite after bite. The warm, pillowy pita that surrounded my kabob was superb. We had a few falafel and half a bowl of soup to take home. Our server (who I imagine was an owner) made a fresh layer of lettuce, tomato and pickled veg for our falafel in the container. He also added more pita and tahini sauce free of charge. It's little touches like this that let you know how much the business cares. We are from out of town but we will always stop at Kabob-G when in town. Phenomenal place.",

The lamb shank is out of this world.  So tender and it just falls off of the bone.  The lamb chops are excellent as well.  Definitely bring your appetite because the meals come with a very large salad that has a garlic dressing that is very rich and creamy.  The left overs are just as good as when they first bring out your food.  I often order take out because of that very reason.  It is small, but just make a reservation.  They are BYOB and do not charge a corkage fee.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone that loves great food.",

However, during the hour or so I was there, they probably got about 6 takeout orders.   If you like baba, you've got to get it here. It's so smooth and creamy, I absolutely love it. The shawarma platters are also pretty good, both the chicken and steak. Perhaps the best part about the restaurant is the service, which was friendly and very quick.

    "text": "What a hidden gem. We had reservations for 4 and were seated right away. Very small and quirky. Door was open and a breeze was blowing in. The screech of the trolleys passing by added to the atmosphere . Food was unbelievable. Authentic middle eastern  fare. Tried the special lollipop lamb chops with Syrian rice,  salad with feta too, fantastic. Portions were huge. Tried the baklava and that was really great! Not one bad thing to say about this place and that's unusual for me, cause I'm tough to please.  Try this place. It's a gem!!",

I give a 5/5 rating for the delicious and flavorful food which I will be enjoying again in the future! Especially the mezza platter which includes all my faves including tabbouleh, hummus and babaganoush! I maintain a 4/5 for the overall rating because of the decor.   I highly recommend Kabob G if you like delicious authentic Lebanese cuisine!",

My wife and I spilt a bunch of things and they were all amazing.  I really like the grape leaves and the green beans.  I would recommend just ordering a bunch of things and spilling them with your table.  Can't wait to come back.",

Major disappointment to the culture and quality of the food I was expecting. Service was really bad too. Being the only one in there I figured you might concentrate on impressing your only customer.",

The Khalils are the sweetest family and Natasha is the kindest, most attentive waitress. Can't say enough nice things about this place. Perfect for any occasion. They are able to accommodate anyone. Honestly I come in here at least once a week and we rarely dine out. Love love love Kabob-G",
