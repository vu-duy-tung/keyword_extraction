    "text": "Hey, 3 stars is A-OK. Sums up this BRGR. I am pretty sure my liking for this location is only out of necessity.  I am spoiled by my current area (and living next door to the original BRGR!), so when I trek back to my hometown area in the South Hills, I expect a few dozen incredible spots to grab food. No. That doesn't happen 'round these parts. I feel forced into appreciating this BRGR.  Between happy hour and the actual burgers, you're cruisin' just fine.  The drinks aren't incredible, but it's a restaurant in a mall. The happy hour specials are the best part of BRGR, so I can't pass up the six bucks on their signature cocktails.  Two poached pears later, I hit the appitizer happy hour specials with the fried zucchini and portobellos.  Zucchini wasn't bad. Really, I couldn't eat the mushrooms.  Mushy and bland, in conjunction with the tomato aioli (liquid smoke flavor tomatoes at best), I give up. I substituted with the orange sauce on the table for the zucchini.  The one that wasn't mustard.  I don't know, maybe chipotle mayo, thousand island? Good luck.  Same original menu that the other locations have seemed to stray from lately, which I really love.  Don't mess with a good thing.  That means the California Lovin' turkey burger is all mine.  In a world of those fearful of sprouts, it's a nice thing to see a big ol' heap of them stuck to the still-green avocado mush under the bun.  Speaking of bun, why can't I get something other than a huge traditional roll or lettuce?  The turkey burger is still incredible though.  The only draw back on this place is the service is a little rough--they typically seem understaffed or just not at that same level of service--and also the desserts aside from milkshakes. Yikes. By the time we hit the place, they maybe have one soggy, sad pudding and cookies jar of who knows what.  I love that they're get 'em while you can, made once a day kind of thing, but that usually means I can't get 'em.  Other than a few chains in the area, this is your lunch and/or happy hour option.  Luckily, it isn't a bad one. Just don't expect too much outside of those cocktails.",

    "text": "I was not a fan of BRGR. Being a build-your-own-burger restaurant fan, I was excited about one opening up so close to home and not having to drive to Robinson to go to THE OTHER DIY BURGER PLACE (now referred to as ODIYBP). I happen to be a regular at ODIYBP.  I was pleasantly surprised at the beer selection, and the prices definitely beat ODIYBP's ....the burgers though? Not great. First of all, if burgers are your restaurant's specialty, why would you choose a ground beef mixture that is so greasy that the bun liquifies within minutes of the beef patty hitting it? Secondly, knowing that your ground beef has such a high fat content that it's going to be a greasy mess, why would you not choose to use buns that hold up to the amount of grease seeping out of your burger??  That aside, I found that ALL I could taste was salt. Everyone at my table commented on the saltiness of their food. No side dishes are included, so I ordered the potato chips, and they were about as good as my burger. Which is to say, not good. I don't know if the frying oil was old or if they'd just sat out for hours. Maybe a combo of both. Who knows.  Tl,dr: go to Burgatory instead.",

I was also told I could have mac n cheese made with special sauce, since I'm a vegetarian, and it was not at all as described. The shakes are good, but their strong alcoholic ones are still a little too sweet and sugary for me. I think they should have a stiff option that actually tastes like booze instead of candy. But that's understandable. The cheesy tots are probably my favourite thing on the menu - totally get it instead of fries as an app!",

    "text": "So, 5 years ago you couldn't find an unfast food burger joint in the Burgh. Now, you can't swing a cat by the tail without hitting one.   Not that I don't mind a good burger joint, being a vegan, I find it to be like a treasure hunt. Please my taste buds without animal flesh and you'll have a customer for the life of your eatery.   BRGR's vegan offering is falafel-\"esque\"in taste and texture. Heavy on the belly after eating. This burger, with its Greek/Lebanese spice & herb influence went well with the Flower Power IPA. I paired this \"burger\" with a tasty slaw done without mayo, opting for a healthier vinegary dressing with apples and golden raisins. Excellent foil for the falafel burger. The slaw's sweetness paired well with the heavily spiced chick pea burger. I've had this offering at the original BRGR, and still the best IMO) I was hoping for something new for the meatless crowd.  I hope this sudden \"need\" for there to be a gourmet burger joint on every block of the city does come to an end soon. But at least it's not another Applebee's, Chilie's or TGIFriday.",

BRGR is usually always packed but we use the online app No Wait to secure a table well in advance. You can walk around the mall while you wait and that helps. The bar area is in one part of the restaurant and they also seem to put families with young kids on the opposite end of patrons without young children. As someone with a toddler, I appreciate that.   I am not a fan of their falafel burger which is unfortunate because its the only veggie burger on the menu. It is dry, tasteless and I'll never order it again. I usually get the grilled cheese appetizer with a salad. My burger indulging friends do love the burgers though and the build your own options.   Anyway, be ready for a long wait on the weekends but do try the milkshakes and beer sampler.",

    "text": "My review will not differ too drastically from other reviewers', and that's a shame. I was expecting so much more from BRGR after hearing all the hype, and particularly after witnessing friends get in arguments over which customizable burger establishment is better, BRGR or Burgatory. For me, the answer is clear, and sadly, that answer is Burgatory.   I was in with a friend visiting from out of town, so we kept it simple since we had a lot of catching up to do. Nothing beats being able to eat a burger with one hand and gesture with the other (hey, good friends let good friends talk with their mouths full). I ordered the Double Yoi burger, which if you know anything about Pittsburgh, is an aptly-named tribute to Myron Cope that echoes a Primanti Brothers' sandwich. It came with pastrami, thousand island dressing, cole slaw, and the part I was looking forward to most, the egg on top.   When you go to a nice burger joint and you get an egg on top, nothing beats cutting or biting into it and seeing or feeling the extravagant hot yolk drip down the sides. That's what I was expecting. I am doing the low-carb thing, so in my case I ordered it without the bun, and I was ready to see that glorious yolk cascade down my giant stack of meat.   WAY disappointed. It was practically over-hard! OVER-HARD! NO yolk drippage at all. I was almost offended. And, on top of it, my medium well burger was cold in the middle. The pastrami was dried out. I understand cooking temperatures well enough to know that a medium well burger shouldn't be icy in the middle. I know from being a line cook, too, that that means my food was probably sitting at the expo station for way too long under a heat lamp.   Neither my friend or I specifically communicated to our waitress that we would like our order of chips with 'crack dip' (I'll touch on that in a moment) to come out first, but it IS an appetizer, and to me, she should have at least asked. She did not, and I was a surprised when our food, which already took quite a while to leave the kitchen, came out with the chips side by side. It could have been handled better.   So back to the 'crack dip.' I spent $4.25 on a basket of fresh fried chips that I shouldn't have eaten (which WERE delicious, crisp, and salty) just to try the 'crack dip' that comes with it. Our waitress explained that it's a to-die-for item, and it's reminiscent of a chili-cheese concoction. I think it has Sriracha in it too, so I was all on board.   It came out in a 3 oz. souffle' cup haphazardly tucked under some chips. It tasted like a combination of CheezWhiz and canned chili you can get at the dollar store. Sadly, I was not impressed for the second time that evening.   All in all, BRGR does have a lot going for it. It has a fun, unique menu with lots of add-ons and many ways to customize your burger. The decor is beautiful and welcoming. The wait was less than expected. The staff was pretty friendly.   I fully understand that sometimes you go to a place and they're having a busy night. Things go wrong. I've worked in a kitchen for years, believe me, I know how that is. But I can't help but feel that everything was so lackluster that I wouldn't want to spend the time, money, and effort of driving to the South Hills to try it again. I'll be sticking to Burgatory for my burger needs from now on.",

Unfortunately we came here for the burgers and these were some of the worst I've ever had.  Ordered the tater tots, average joe and the spicy burger (with sriracha sauce and jalapenos).  Both burgers had underwhelming flavor (yes even the \"spicy\" burger) and meat was chewy and not tasty.  Brioche buns were ok, not too bready.  Ordered a side salad that was presented as fresh romaine and seasonal vegetables with egg and bacon bits.  What arrived was a withered bowl of iceberg with chunks of bleu cheese and soggy tomatoes.  Yes I know it's a burger place but don't advertise your salads as something they're not.    Totally average or below average burger spot in my opinion.

The burgers were decent in size, but lacking flavor, and very expensive. Everything you get on your burger is basically an added expense.

The person to my left had a burger wrapped in lettuce. Her burger came out with a hair on it. They did make a new burger for her. They also credited out the base burger but charged for the cheese and mushrooms.  The person to my right had a grass fed burger. She ordered it medium-well and it come out medium-rare to rare. They took it back and then brought out the replacement with items that were supposed to be kept off. Again they credited the main burger but charged for the additional items on the burger.

This is a convenient location right inside of the Galleria and right down the hill from SHV Mall. I'm always a big fan of a Cease and Desist burger which is like a fancy big mac. I'd skip the milk shake and get the truffle cheese wiz fries.",

They also use the No Wait app in case you want to put your name in ahead of time when you're on the way, which is a plus on a Friday night. Nice that you have options to shop while you wait too. Burger options are good and we like to build our own. Burgers do not come with any sides but the al la carte sides are definitely large enough for two or more people to share. My husband and I always split the cajun tator tots and can never finish them all. Drinks are definitely pricier. Even if you both just have one expect your bill to be a good $25 higher. But overall definitely a fan and will continue to come here often for quick bites.",

BURGR is great, BRGR is not.  The mushroom burger was undercooked and the bread was soggy (seemed like a McDonald's bun - not even toasted). The fried pickles had no seasoning or character. It was simply a pickle, fried. No original preparation.  The only good thing about this place is the wait staff. They are friendly. Too bad they have to be at the forefront dishing out the crap from the kitchen. They deserve better.  Do not go here.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever!!! Service was awful and the manger was even worse. I would never go back here. We ordered an appetizer when we ordered our drinks. After we ordered our food our waitress never came back. We had to call her over to our table multiple times. She never refreshed our drinks. After 25 minutes of waiting for our app, we had to reminder her that we wanted our appetizer before our meal. She stated \"ohhhh yeah I forgot\". She brought the app out and 2 minutes later brought out our burgers. We order 1 medium burger and 2 medium well. The two that order medium well were still dripping blood! The medium was the most cooked burger. When we called our waitress over to ask to have new burger (yes -- she never return to check on us after delivering our food-- we had to wait another 15 minutes) she gave us an education on how that is how BRGR does their burgers. She said that their cooks are the worst ever. After taking our plates back to the kitchen she returned to tell us that they were \"heating them up on the microwave\". SERIOUSLY???????!!!!!!   When we asked to talk to the manager she came over and asked what we wanted her to do about it. We said we wanted new burgers and she said she would see what she could do. When she returned we told her that we didn't want the food anymore and we were leaving. She told us that we would have to pay for the check! When we questioned it she said \"well you have to pay for the beers\". I was fine with paying for the two beers we got. When she brought over the check it was $40. When we questioned it, she insisted we pay and ran back into the kitchen. We went up to the hostess booth and asked to speak to the manager again. She came out and threaten to call the police if we didn't pay. FOR FOOD WE DIDNT EAT!!!  We live 5 minutes from the Galleria and we will never be returning. Especially since their own staff says their cooks are the worst! No thank you! Beware and save your money! Wish you could give a zero star on yelp!",

I've heard it can be up to 2 hours, but since it was 7:30pm on a Tuesday we were in the clear.   The service was wonderful. Our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful when we asked questions about the menu. But the burgers and sides were just kind of okay. Which isn't bad. I think I was just expecting a blow-your-mind burger.  I ordered the Sante Fe Hippie, but substituted beef for the vegetarian patty...so I guess it was only kind of half a hippie. And it was a decent burger, don't get me wrong about that. If I had gotten it for like $6 at a burger shack I would have been really impressed, but for a gourmet burger restaurant I'd say it was just alright.   The burgers at BRGR don't come with a side of chips or fries. But they have shareable sides you can order that are big enough for two people. We got tater-tots. It seemed like they were just the tater-tots you can get at the grocery store and make in the oven. It's nice there are a few different side options other than just fries though.  I'm happy we tried BRGR. But from now on when I want a gourmet burger, I'll always go to Burgatory.",

    "text": "My two boys took me to lunch today. (That's one of the upsides of having young adult children-they take you out AND pay!). This was our first time at this location. I liked the decor.  It was contemporary western. Cool walls that look like pallets lit from the inside paired with unique lighting.  We started with an order of their chips and dip. They call their dip Crack so I had high expectations. Their chips are similar to kettle cooked chips and they have a dusting on them that I believe includes a BBQ flavor. The dip was disappointing. It was like they opened a can of chili and dumped it into little cups. I recommend you skip the chips and go straight for the fries!  They were hot, a little crispy and had a tiny smidge of herbs and cheese sprinkled on them.  I ordered a made to order burger-Angus meat, white cheddar, bacon, and lettuce. The burgers come with a pickle on the side. I ordered the burger medium but it came out rare. I'm not a huge fan of rare but will eat it occasionally. The beef didn't have any flavor so even if I had sent it back to bee cooked a little more it wouldn't have changed the flavor.  My oldest son made his own burger-angus beef, an egg, tomato, pepper jack cheese, and one or two other things. He ordered his burger medium and his too was rare. Please note that when I say Rare I mean the entire inside was pink. These burgers were only in the grill long enough to brown the outsides.  My youngest son ordered a hot dog. At first I thought $6 for a plain hot dog was a bit high but when the hot dog came out it was huge. It was the size of four hot dogs put together. My son loved it.  BRGR has a lot to choose from-burgers, hotdogs, salads and more. I think that a good burger can stand alone and can taste good without lots of toppings but that isn't the case here. So go wild with the choices of toppings because that is where your flavor will be coming from.",

We asked to speak to a manager to see as to why we were cut off and the manager told us the Bartenders had reported us too intoxicated. 30 year olds having had one drink? Awful service from a manager having no answer or example of any behavior that would call for their decision. In the past the staff has been cold and at times rude and this last visit proved that yes they are rude, unprofessional, and have no regards for customer service.

You would think they would be piping hot.  But, no, they were just warm.  Had they been pre-cooked?  It was curious.  We ordered the Cajun tots and an order of fries.  The burgers were pretty tasteless, not juicy, which only added to our thoughts that they may have been pre-cooked.  Fries were nothing special and the tots on top had a sprinkling of spices, not enough to earn the Cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.  Personally, I think that if you are at the Galleria and want a burger, the burgers at Houlihans are better.  Also, and this may seem petty, but I hate being served on plastic plates with the paper on the plate.  We won't bother going back, we felt the same way about the BRGR in East Liberty.  Too bad, I was hoping for a success at that location, it has been through a few iterations of restaurants.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to try something new for our weekly get together and we settled here. We were amazed to see that the menu resembled Burgatory which allows you to \"craft your own burgers\" in a similar fashion.  We had table seating in a wooden western style room. The waitress reviewed menu options with us so the two of us decided to try the BRGR signature burger. We were stunned that this burger comes with foie gras (a $12.00 upcharge if you opt for it). Haven't seen foie gras in any casual family dining in my life! The two of us also decided that since the burgers were 8 oz we would split an order of cole slaw which came with gold raisins and carrots.  While we were waiting for the entree the manager came and explained to us that this is the 4th restaurant in the city and when the weather improves they plan to expand and put on an outdoor deck for outdoor dining.  We had our meals served fairly rapidly. The BRGR is dry aged prime beef alone with pickled red onions, arugula, creamy blue cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes. Laying on top of the burger was a long piece of the foie gras. Since we both ordered the same thing we found the burger enjoyable but nothing to give a hoot about. We had ordered it well done and it came that way.  On the other hand we were definitely impressed with the cole slaw. The addition of the gold raisins made it so good!!!  I found that this place has complimentary Wi-Fi. They also specialize in milk shakes and floats where you can choose to have them \"spiked\". They have a wine and alcohol list as well since they have a bar there but we were too full from our meal to try any of these.  The place wasn't overly crowded since we came mid afternoon and we were each given paper copies of the menu to take home. I guess they must have take out but I really don't know for sure.  As far as the foie gras goes, it is overpriced and I feel it is a delicacy you would better enjoy in a finer restaurant.  Other selections include various appetizers, hot dogs, and salads. The Galleria where it is located has a multiplex theater inside of it and this place would be a great place to go before or after a movie.  We will give it another try sometime in the future.",

    "text": "Located in the South Hills at the Galleria where Dragonfire grill used to be. The decor is modern rustic looking. Very clean as you would hope for anywhere but especially at a new restaurant.   This was my first time at a BRGR. I thought the menu was small compared to most restaurants in general but the focus is obviously the burger. After reviewing the few non burger choices, it became clear that a burger is what you are supposed to do. You can create your own by choosing toppings, bun, type of meat, etc. This could get pricey though because you pay for each item. I had the turkey burger (pictured) which was very good and I would happily have again. Their \"crack mac\" was tasty but underwhelming and not that special in my opinion.   Burgers don't come with any sides, they are all al la carte but big enough to probably share between people.   Bottom line, I thought it was good and would go back but I wasn't really blown away. I think you could get an equally satisfying burger somewhere else.",

    "text": "This place took over the footprint of the Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor of the Galleria right across from Anthropologie.  Upon checking in there was 2 listings for BRGR which are duplicates so I had checked them both out.  It was already around 2pm and we didn't have lunch yet so I thought we'd give it a try.  They have a pretty good beer menu.  I was more concerned about the drafts on the beer card which had drafts on one side and bottled on the other.  While it wasn't feasible to do so I ended up getting the \"crate\" which is 4 x 5oz draft beers of your choice for 12 dollars.  So I knew that 20oz for 12 bucks is a bad deal but I wanted to try all 4 IPAs they had so this was the easiest way without having 4 pints.  The beers were all distinctly different but good.  I think my favorite was the one from Massachusetts (#1).  The place honestly reminds me a lot of how Burgatory does their menu with the custom choices.    I went with a bison on a brioche with blue cheese, bacon and onion straws.  I had also ordered the fries which by default come with Parmesan cheese and herbs.    My wife had decided on macaroni and cheese and it came with a hot dog.    My burger was great.  The meat while it didn't necessarily look to be done medium wasn't overdone.  The blue was real blue not the kind of blue that is used in dressing or served with wings.  The onion straws were crispy and fresh, not cold and dry.  The burger itself was a near 5 or as close as I can give it.  I'd say safely it was better than the similar burger I had ordered last time I went to Burgatory.  The fries were good too.  While there was an option for gravy or chili and cheese I didn't want that.  I'd go that route if this wasn't a gourmet burger I think but I didn't really want anything to take away from the burger itself.  Where they fell off was what my wife had ordered.  I told her next time we go to a burger place, order a burger and not what they do not specialize in.  Her mac and cheese with a hot dog was a sufficient sized serving.  The dog was huge and really thick.  The thing is it was either boiled or steamed and it was sort of bland.  The mac and cheese wasn't a mac and cheese.  It was scoobi do or swirl type pasta except it was with a chili mixed in so the easiest way to describe it is that it was more like a Hamburger Helper.  Not a cheesy mac and cheese but rather a pasta mixed with chili.    Regardless of the macaroni and cheese fail the burger balanced it out and so I will give this place a 4* because I didn't think it was just OK but rather better than that.  If I had to choose between BRGR and Burgatory that would be tough.  I haven't had enough of the menu of each to say which I prefer more but with what I had today at BRGR compared to what I had at Burgatory last time I think BRGR wins this round.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of this chain's competitor, Burgatory. I had heard mixed reviews for BRGR, but thought it was worth assessing for myself which was indeed the burger regent supreme. I ordered the Gobbler, which includes a turkey burger, sage stuffing, pickled green beans, and cranberry relish on a buttered brioche, along with an almond praline milkshake. The shake was good.  A note about the service, which docked a star from my rating. First, the server was unbelievably rude to one of my dinner partners when carding him. She grabbed his ID roughly, and scowled as she spent about 5 minutes assessing he legitimacy of his license. Note- we all look a little young, but he is well over 21. Second, my dinner partners are both gluten free (not by choice), part of what made us select this location - they have a dedicated GF fryer. The server left our table after we had thanked her for the restaurant's attention to GF needs. Her sarcastic parting words - \"We will TRY our best to make sure everything is gluten free\"....Hmmmm. Not the most confidence boosting when A) it's not a choice, and B) when we just mentioned that we drove nearly 30 minutes out of our way to get to your location...  The turkey burger was tasty, but not at all memorable. My dinner partners said their beef burgers were good, not great. They were not very polite when my friend asked for a burger a touch off rare. Our Cajun tater tots were more like paprika tater tots. I'm just not convinced that this place is worth the drive or the money. I will almost certainly NOT be back. Maybe with a different server the food would earn 3 stars, but I don't think I'll be driving out this way for a burger again.",

Zucchini and mushrooms were greasy and the zucchini was too thin.  It was all breading.  2. Improve your wine selection.  Pint Grigio from Georgia with a twist top is not a good choice to serve.  3. Improve service training. Sitting at the bar and getting water was good but waiting 10 minutes and watching others get orders before us is frustrating.    Overall the experience was ok, but I'm not sure I would be compelled to come back.",

It's not that we ordered anything special that would have caused a delay. We also did not have an appetizer, which sometimes delays the main course.

My wife's smoked cheddar on her burger was non-existent. It looked like it had melted off the burger and was still sitting on the grill.

    "text": "The excitement had been building all summer when it was announced that BRGR would finally open a franchise in Mount Lebanon's, stodgy, ho-hum Galleria mall, occupying a spot once held by the redundant teppenyaki showcase Dragonfire. Hype aside, I can soberly tell you that BRGR will Deliver The Goods should you choose to dine there...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsoNcOfRvOtg&s=1b568a8ea3a3b7236f9675971be18e3b6155205b1fa9c22bf4b70e149845f0d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=soNc...</a>  Ox horns bedeck the grey stone walls. The floors are wooden as are the dividing panels that make the open restaurant space seem as if it is a place unto itself. One can dine at the bar, at booths, tables, or around a couch near a faux fireplace. You'll forget that you're at a mall and fool yourself into thinking that a wealthy friend invited you over for a homemade lunch. The interior design is that ingenious.   Even more ingenious is the menu. As a fan of Burgatory, I can say that BRGR has plunged its own flag into the hill, offering tricks and aces that the former didn't think of or keep up its sleeve. Having pecked that out, anyone who thinks that BRGR is swiping from Burgatory needs to stick with Five Guys.   Yes, like Burgatory, BRGR allows patrons to customize their burgers by way of a checklist. But...does Burgatory offer sage stuffing, tomato-cucumber relish, 6 different kinds of aioli (!), braised short-ribs (!!), pastrami (!!!)?   Does Burgatory leave squeeze bottles of complimentary, housemade condiments on each table? Go on. Dip your fries into that signature BRGR sauce (1,000 Island) you squirted a glob of onto your plate. It's free!   How about potato salad? Ha! You thought only Tessaro's did that, eh? Our server, who happens to moonlight at nearby Red Robin, whispered that it is \"the best ever,\" and it is certainly a challenger, its ideally boiled spud cubes intermingling with a luxuriously tangy sour cream dill dressing garnished with fatty, briny bacon bits.   And what of the intriguing appetizers? Ground Angus Eggrolls for the lady? How about Pot Roast Tater Tots for the kids? For us it was the Grilled Cheese Bites. Amusingly served with a dandy soup-like tomato fondue, this was childhood comfort food at its zenith. Toothpick-skewered buttery Texas Toast wedges bookended provolone, bacon, truffle aioli (Jesus!), tomatoes, and pickle chips. Each tempting tetrahedron glistened with ample layered flavors and textures while naked, but when coated with the zesty fondue became positively transcendent hors d'oeuvres.  Meanwhile, about that Angus bull in the room we're ignoring...  Like Burgatory, BRGR offers standard builds for the indecisive, but with all those fixin's, I had to set my imagination free.   My meat of choice (there are 8 to pick from) was the Angus, mainly due to its engrossing chuck/ sirloin/ New York strip/rib eye blend, all of which introduced themselves to my palate without any of them overriding each other. Cooked perfectly to medium-rare, I uttered \"They nailed it\" as the savory juice dripped onto the plate and the pink interiors were exposed. Not wanting to overdo the accoutrements, I added the tomato-cucumber relish, the bearnaise aioli (gasp!), brie (oh yes, I went there!), short ribs, and guacamole. Constructed thoughtfully, the burger held together amazingly well. A Southwestern Eggs Benedict with steak and pot-au-feu on toasted Brioche, it was an opulent, handheld celebration of succulence, and I had it comin' to me.   Desserts might be where Burgatory gains the upper hand. While my S'mores milkshake was very good with its mix of vanilla bean and dark chocolate ice cream, its miniature marshmallows came off as storebought (even if the ice cream itself is housemade), and its runny composition was a weak partner to Burgatory's thicker, far more decadent, more visually appealing milkshakes. Again, BRGR makes fine milkshakes, but I felt I could have had one of similar quality at any ice cream stand. Burgatory's milkshakes are on another plateau.   Also indulged in was one of BRGR's cake cups. Reminiscent of a small parfait or a trifle, each dessert comes in its own chilled mason jar. Mine was of the Oreo variety and was crumbly, creamy, and adequately appetizing.   BRGR's french fries stand a little taller than Burgatory's, however. BRGR's yellow, crispy, parmesan embellished shafts have a pristine nature to them, one that fits their extravagant surroundings. \"O\" fries these are not, as good as those are. Aristocratic is a word that floats to the surface.   BRGR Vs. Burgatory ends in a draw, each eatery complimenting the other, neither failing in any capacity. Our metro area and the collective appetites of its inhabitants are big enough. There's plenty of room for both to battle for eternity. Angels Vs. Demons.   P.S. Our wait during an early Sunday afternoon visit was less than 10 minutes.   P.P.S. The service was superb.   P.P.P.S. BRGR's cake cups come from an outside vendor called The Baked Pastry Company.   P.P.P.P.S. BRGR's menus vary somewhat depending on location.",

    "text": "I've always been a big fan of BRGR - while they're not my absolute favorite burger place in the 'Burgh they easily make my top five list. I actually prefer them over another similar local burger franchise since I find their portion sizes to be considerably more reasonable and their meals juicier and tastier overall. So when I heard that a BRGR was coming to my part of town I was thrilled. After giving them a couple months to work out of the growing pains that come with any business or restaurant opening at a new location, I made it a point to stop on in and check out the newest member of the BRGR family.  I came in on a Saturday so the place was, unsurprisingly, hopping. One thing I do want to note is that I noticed while playing with my phone after sitting that my No Wait app said there was no wait for general seating, which was not correct; I fortunately didn't have to wait since I was willing to sit at the bar. After looking over the familiar BRGR menu and ordering I could take in the look of the place. It's quirky, but in a good way I think; the lounge chairs, cow-pattern foot-rests, big screen TVs, wooden decor all kind of come together in what I guess is supposed to be a kind of modern Western look. 'Cause...beef equals cows equals Western, maybe? It definitely doesn't look terrible despite my teasing, but I admit that since they're located in a mall they don't have quite the same atmosphere as the stand-alone eastside joint.  Mall location or not, the food is exactly what I've come to expect from BRGR. I actually ordered a custom burger, which came out SUPER quickly (within 15 minutes of ordering) despite the full house. I also ordered a S'mores milkshake which was admittedly delayed - I had to ask about it after my burger came out - but it made it to my seat within a couple minutes after the mix-up had been discovered, so the delay wasn't a huge issue. The milkshake was just yummy - the ice cream itself was creamy and the drink was covered in marshmallows, complete with cracker bites and chocolate chips sprinkled in throughout the beverage. I enjoyed every sip of it! And my burger, while admittedly not the juiciest burger ever, was still very very good and cooked exactly as I'd ordered. I'd asked for fried egg, avocado, tomato-cucumber relish, pepper jack cheese, bacon and mushrooms, and it was an excellent blend - plus a few pieces of avocado and whatnot slipped off of the burger as I ate (which isn't something that happens often when I eat burgers or sandwiches and whatnot, since I'm a very neat eater), so I'd definitely say they didn't skimp on the toppings! My only additional comment on the burger would be that the pepper jack cheese really didn't have any kick to it like I'd hoped, so if you like more flavorful pepper jack like I do you may want to pass on it here.  Overall I was very pleased with my meal here, which for the most part had no issues and no delays despite the busy Saturday mall crowd. I will definitely keep this new location in mind the next time I want a burger and I just don't have it in me to leave the area and go elsewhere - plus I really do want to come back to enjoy some of my favorite BRGR drinks and appetizers!",

Showing up here on a weekend night and expecting a timely service would require miracle heretofore unseen by modern man.   It's be one thing if the product ultimately delivered was exceptional, but waiting nearly 80 minutes for a forgettable burger and a limping soggy mess of sweet potato fries is the kind of experience that makes you wonder if you'd just be better of hitting up Wendy's instead.   An incredible disappoint from first blush. You're better off eating elsewhere in Lebo.",

We were blamed for the phone number on our Grubhub account being incorrect. I'm not sure if our bag was forgotten or lost but we weren't given an apology or a discount or anything to make up for the stress. I guess we'll place our $100+ orders elsewhere from now on.",

They have a very nice seating area to wait. The place was packed and our waiter was fantastic. I felt bad as they were down a milkshake maker and all the servers had to make their own. That must have been a pain on a busy Saturday evening.  This place is very kid friendly and a great place for families. This was a negative for me as we were trying to enjoy a date night and kids were running around everywhere making a mess.  The wait staff must be used to this as they did not bat an eye and did an excellent job cleaning up the place after each party left.    Now onto the food which left me pretty disappointed. I ordered a regular burger with lettuce, onion, tomato and sharp cheddar cheese. It was mediocre and also $9.  The burgers come with nothing-I mean come on at least give us a few chips. Nope you have to pay $4.5 for chips which come with a cheesy, meat dipping sauce that is not good.  I wanted a side salad and they can only give you 1/2 salads of their entree salad. I went with half of the Cesar salad and the dressing must be made with anchovies which I do not like at all.  We topped the night off with a nonalcoholic salted caramel pretzel milkshake which is pretty darn tasty but to be honest they are better at Burgatory.",

Should have known when we walked up and saw tons of people that we weren't getting right in. 30 minute wait. Strike 1. We proceeded to have a seat, and while outside the restaurant we noticed 2 different groups of people waiting along with us. While waiting those parties had waitresses come up and get drink orders and then food orders for them. We kind of looked at each other thinking wth?? I guess they didn't notice us a mere 2 feet away, or maybe we didn't look hungry. Strike 2. We waited 45 minutes and finally got a table. Strike 3. After we were seated it took forever for a waitress to stop by, long enough we ordered everything at that time from drinking burgers to sides because I couldn't risk having to wait even more. Strike 4. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive, that is unacceptable to me. Especially when there were 2 tables seated after us that got their food before us. Strike 5. Food arrived, the burgers were actually cooked to medium (unlike most places even though they ask) And the onion ring and fry sides were both very large. If you were wondering about the fries in the menu the regular ones are frozen fries and the fresh cut fries have the skin on them and are actually fresh. Highly recommend those, fresh cut are always the best. Refills on the drinks was slow, super slow. Waitress was friendly. It by the time we saw her the entire evening had been ruined for me. They did give a 10% military discount. Wished a manager had made there way to our table (did see someone walking around to check on people). They would have gotten an earful from us. Highly doubt we will be back, sad because I really wanted to try their adult shakes!",

I did say away from the foie gras based other reviews and was not will to \"jump out of a tree\" with the cost.   The burger was not bland but I think that was due to the toppings.  French Fries were really good.  They reminded me of McDonalds for some reason (thin cut / crispy - even on delivery).   The gravy was tasty as well.

I've had better fried pickles, since their batter was super heavy and made for chicken, but they were still good.   We ordered our food and we waited FOREVER for it. 3 other tables that got there after us were getting their food before us. Finally when the food came out, my burger was COLD. I'm not joking, it had no heat. It was obvious that it was sitting out the whole time we were waiting. I'm guessing our waitress either forgot or she didn't put all of our orders in. So I sent the burger back, the manager came out with the new one, didn't even say they were sorry or that they would comp the burger, nothing. She just said \"here you go, how's everyone else's? Okay good\" and walked away. The new burger also tasted a bit raw, too, but I didn't have the time or energy to say anything else.   The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the milkshakes are great and so are the fries and I liked the decor. But I am definitely not going back.

Service is so-so, sometimes great and other times not so much. The same goes for food quality; I have been here many times where my meal had been top notch and exactly what I ordered, and I have been here other times where meats are not cooked properly and sides came out much earlier or later than the main entree. Overall the good experiences definitely outweigh the bad but there is still room for improvement at this location.",

Maybe not a full 4 star, but certainly better than a 3. (When is Yelp going to allow up to use 1/2 stars?)  my Dad was in a gourmet burger mood this Father's Day, so we decided to hit a spot we never tried before..BRGR. We each started with a nicely mixed Manhattan, and then both had the Steakhouse burger (angus, blue cheese, onion straws) and split an order of fries. All was great. Certainly didn't leave hungry. The rest of the burger menu ranges from beef to turkey to tuna to black bean. Lots of topping choices. If you don't like the burgers here, you don't like burgers!",

It took a while for a bartender to grab us menus or drinks, but I think we just happened to sit down in a few of the busiest moments of the night.  Once the bartenders saw us, they took great car of us. We started off with two beers since they had a GF beer for me! Then we ordered burgers. I can't even remember what my other half ordered since I was drooling over my El Gaucho Verde burger. I couldn't decide between two but the bartender steered me toward the Gaucho and he steered me right.  The burger was perfectly topped with alfalfa sprouts and other deliciousness. The sauce was just perfect. I'll certainly be ordering this burger again! We also ordered a sauce of the house made sauce, but we didn't like the \"secret sauce\", so we ended up dipping them in ranch.  To any gluten free people, they are very knowledgeable and have lots of options here. I'll certainly be back!",

I decided on a BYO burger - grass fed beef, pepper jack cheese, garlic aioli, mushrooms, and onions on a lettuce wrap.  The (iceberg) lettuce bun was plentiful and tightly secured with a long toothpick. I did enjoy this burger, but thought the patty could use a bit more seasoning & more mushrooms (I only found 2 small mushroom slices on my burger). It was also a bit costly at $14 after I added the toppings- I think some toppings, like sliced onion, sliced tomato, or pickle slices (pickles aren't listed as a topping choice oddly) should be free toppings because the burger itself is already upwards of $10 with no toppings.  Instead of fries or chips, I got a half portion of Greek salad- it was very good and a nice bowl portion. It had feta cheese, Kalimantan olives, cucumbers, sliced banana peppers, and tomatoes.  I really enjoyed the Greek dressing, though it was very sweet!  The waiter was on top of everything and very friendly.  I would be back again to treat myself whilst staying on track with my diet!",

A favorite appetizer of mine here are the grilled cheese bites.  They are crispy, cheesy, and taste amazing.  They also pair well with the tomatoe soup side you get with them.  My favorite burger here is the steakhouse.  It comes on a toasted brioche bun which does a great job of holdiall of the toppings and burger together.  The combination of the bleu cheese, aioli, and onion strings is perfect.  I order mine medium rare and they always cook it perfectly.    Having said that, the burgers here are not on the level of the best in the city.  It is essentially a lesser version of burgatory.",

He also managed to concoct an orange creamsicle milkshake, even though it wasn't on the menu, and honest to god knock me out, that thing was FIRE. I've never been so stoked for a milkshake in my entire dang life.  We got wings n'at, which was perfect 420 food, and then 2 burgers, the shroom burger and the bison bbq burger.

This time I went with the impossible burger. I have tried this once before at Burgatory and it was delicious. This one fell short for me though. It was very flat and not juicy at all, coming across more like a veggie patty. I do like that you can choose between different buns or a lettuce wrap which I went with this time!

But, if you're a restaurant that specializes in burgers and you can't manage to cook them to order and get them to the diner hot, then why bother?  My burger has rarely come out the way I ordered it and the last couple times, the burger has been room temp.  Eww!  We were there this past Sunday night.  It was not crowded when we arrived but the patio filled up quickly.  There was only one server and he was definitely in the weeds.  In my opinion, it is his job to let his manager know this and it is her job to fix it.  My husband ordered a second beer which never arrived.  The manager reduced our bill, but that didn't make the meal any more enjoyable, just cheaper.  I think we've given BRGR plenty of opportunity to prove itself, so we'll just stick to Burgatory or Bubba's Gourmet Burghers in Bridgeville.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for BRGR.  Great decor - the patio was open - lots of sunshine and the temperature was perfect. Loved the atmosphere.  I ordered a built-to-order burger with a brioche bun.  I wanted a medium rare burger, but the service talked me into a medium burger.  She was somewhat intimidating.  Long story short - the burger was closer to medium well than medium.  I cut the burger in half - and within 2 -3 bites the bun fell apart.  The burger was very greasy.  To me, it seemed like a dry burger with lots of grease.  Maybe I would have liked it better if it was medium rare - but I didn't think it had a lot a flavor. My chin was covered with grease,  Brought the second half home, and there was grease dripping from the box. Worst $10 burger ever.  Very disappointed.  However, the reason I gave BRGR two stars was because the french fries were fantastic.  Absolutely great.  If it wasn't for the fires, I would absolutely not go back.  But I may give them a second try - but the last thing I'll order is a burger.",

My fiance and I went in one evening, and were able to be seated right away which was great.  Then our waitress came by and asked if we had ever been before and we said no. She just kind of shrugged it off like \"oh, oh well you're here now.\" When it came time to order I told her I have an onion and onion powder allergy, so I had a few options picked out and asked if any of them would be able to be made without the onion or onion powder. She told me no and that my only option was absolutley no seasoning without even attempting to make it look like she would check with the kitchen for me. Not even a \"would you like salt and pepper?\" as an option!  I was a waitress for 6 years, and I know how demanding people can be, but she didn't even attempt to make it look like she cared, she just wanted to be done with us. We got our food, obviously it was bland and tasteless, and she never tried to see if there was anything she could do for us to make it better. All in all, the food normally is probably better, but the unenthusiastic service leaves such a bad taste in your mouth, it's hard to tell.",

    "text": "We went here on a Sunday afternoon and were pleased to be seated with no wait.  The layout of the restaurant seems odd in that I felt kind of exposed at the table.  We ordered the fried pickle appetizer.  This was an odd recipe consisting of pickle strips in what is basically unseasoned batter like you would find in fish and chips.  The flavorless batter is far too heavy for an appetizer and doesn't go well with pickles.  They need to change the recipe.  I have never seen fried pickles done this way but am always up for something new.  However, this didn't work.  My burger, ordered medium, with bacon and bleu cheese wasn't very good.  It was dry and tasted like it had sat for a while.  It was barely warm.  The lettuce and tomato were very bland.  The brioche bun was the only positive.  My lady did not like her turkey burger and said it had no taste.  The bun was very cold on her burger.   Worst of all were the fries with parmesan cheese, herbs, and salt.  Parmesan cheese is a very salty cheese and this combined with the salt on the fries simply made for too much salt.  Further, very thin fries (think McDonalds) mean you get way too much salt in each bite.  The fries were a complete disaster.  A few years ago, we went to the original BRGR and were underwhelmed  We were hoping this would be a different experience.    Service and interactions with staff went well.",

It came loaded with sour cream on top, I ordered salad very light on dressing....it came loaded with gobs of dressing.  The bartender showed me his ticket stating \"no sour cream and light dressing!\"  My issue is what if someone has a food allergy and the kitchen staff doesn't even look at what is requested. If the kitchen won't look at customers needs and requests, I will not patronize this restaurant.  Someone is going to get very sick or die because this establishment refuses to look at customer needs.  Shame on you.  Naturally the manager offered me a refund which I refused.  What I really wanted...was what I wanted.  He totally missed the point.  Instead of offering me a refund he should have been in he kitchen coaching his staff and watching the orders coming in and going out.  Instead, he chose to sit customers and stay out front.  Too bad, the problems in the back",

My wife got a diet and I order a coke. We both received diet. Not a huge deal for me but I could tell the mostly high school student staff wasn't experienced.   -Ordered the grilled cheese bites appetizer, it was literally a grilled cheese sandwich cut in fourths. Not even an overly good sandwich at that.   -My wife ordered a \"make your own burger.\" the waitress asked no questions (such as how she would like her burger cooked) nor did she repeat her order to make sure it was correct. Her burger was marked as being cooking medium well but it was extremely dry.   -The only issue I had with my meal were the Cajun tater tots. They were just frozen tots with a heavy dusting of Cajun powder on them.   -Overall, for a lunch that was pretty costly I was disappointed.

If I were to recommend ordering one burger in particular, I would suggest the 'smokehouse bison' burger (done mid-rare). It's incredibly juicy when cooked to this specification.  I also recommend trying (in addition to your burger) ordering the side of the seasonal cole slaw. It's very refreshing and makes an excellent side dish to your meal, but at $5, it's a tad pricey.

    "text": "After calling to check the wait time three days over the course of a couple weeks, the hostess told us about the NoWait app. After downloading the app, I was able to get on the list without having to be at the restaurant. GENIOUS! The wait time in the app said 45-1 hour. We arrived 50 minutes later and our table was ready. I overheard the hostess apologize as she told those in line without the app that they'd have a hour long wait. On a side note, this was actually not as bad as the other times we called- 2+ hour wait. So, the real question was would BRGR live up to the hype and extraordinary wait times? The answer - in short- No.  I started with a chocolate milkshake while hubs got a martini. The shake was thick and tasty. No complaints there. The food came out quickly, especially the kids meal. I ordered the Average Joe with white cheddar. I was looking for the basic burger so that I could really taste the flavor and quality of the meat. Hubs ordered a salmon burger and we split the BRGR fries which were described as being topped with parmesan and herbs. Being preggo, I had to order my burger well done. Regardless of the temp, my expectation at a restaurant that specializes in burgers is to have a well seasoned, juicy burger. What I ended up with was a dry, somewhat tasteless piece of meat. The fries were also decidedly average. The parm and herbs were lightly sprinkled on top and did not stick to the fries. On a positive note, the service was great. Overall, I am in no rush to get back to BRGR. Nothing stood out to me as being spectacular. Maybe the crazy toppings on some of the specialty burgers add the missing flavor element. But, I've had better \"basic\" burgers at places like Smashburger.",

Hell if 15 minutes is to far for you, there is a Red Robin a half mile away go there, their prices and product are better than this place. My wife and I went here for a late dinner during the week, after hearing mostly positive reviews about this place we decided to give it a try. This place really left something to be desired. Other than the service which was fine, and the appetizer; we were pretty disappointed. We each had an exaggeratedly overpriced beer, with tax my run of the mill IPA was over $9 and she got a $7 strongbow cider, that is stadium like prices.  Our burgers were flavorless, greasy, hunks of meat which left something to be desired. Another thing that annoyed me with this place is there are no sides with your burger, if I am going to pay $13 for a mediocre burger, I would expect some sort of side fries, chips, something. After all said and done I paid over $60 with tip to be disappointed by a subpar burger. Hope this helps.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been interested in trying BRGR since it was recommended by a friend. We were unable to wait over 45 minutes last time we came to the Galleria during the Holidays, but this time we came on a Tuesday night after a movie and the place was nearly empty. We immediately got a booth on the wall, the host was friendly and the place was clean. So far so good. Our server (Erin) greeted us pretty quickly and we ordered the fried pickle appetizer, a margarita and an IPA from the extensive selection of beer. The margarita was ok, but my husband enjoyed the beer. We ordered the BRGR burger with the dry aged beef, the Glazed and Confused meatloaf burger, and an order of fries to share.  The fried pickles were pickle spears, not chips, which was disappointing. I wish I had known, because I probably would have passed on them. They were a little greasy for my taste, and we didn't finish them (this never happens).   Our server came and asked my husband if he wanted another beer and he started to say yes. She took off and ordered him a second IPA without asking if he wanted the same beer as before or if he wanted a different beer. He was looking at the beer list and wanted a different beer, but it was too late. I wanted another drink, too. But I just waited until she returned and ordered it. She seemed in a hurry and distracted. I ordered the pomegranate martini and it was very good.  Our food came. My husband's burger was cooked well, and he said it was good. My sandwich was also good. Very messy, but tasty meatloaf wrapped in bacon, with bbq sauce and potato salad and cheese. Way too big to eat the whole thing. I took half of it home and barely touched the fries. The fries were good, plenty for two people. We also took them home. We did not have any of the sauces on our table mentioned by previous posters, but they sound good. It looked like the staff was closing down early and leaving. At one point a man was standing in the middle of the restaurant with a rolling dumpster full of garbage. Hours before closing! Not sure about management of this place....  The food was good, but not great by any means. The reason I am giving 3 stars as opposed to 4 is because we were rushed through our dinner, and felt as though our server couldn't wait to leave. She didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything, just closed out our check. We have young kids and solo date nights are rare for us, so we really didn't feel like being rushed.The restaurant was open for two more hours, so we just waited for our food and continued our date until we were ready to leave.",

    "text": "Was really hoping that this place would be on par with Butgatory, but the burger I had was really bland. In fact it reminds me why I generally don't order burgers. The fries were mediocre (dry, somewhat stale and equally flavorless). The waitstaff was unimpressive, as well. The only positive was that there's a decent selection of beers on draft.   In addition, the atmosphere was pretty weak. The chairs were uncomfortable and people are somewhat crammed into the restaurant.   Very disappointed. Was really hoping to see a restaurant come in into that space that would last, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're closed within a year based on my experience.",
