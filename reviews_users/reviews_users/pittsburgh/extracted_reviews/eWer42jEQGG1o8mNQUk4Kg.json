I first ordered the sushi which was ok and for our meals i ordered the chicken and scallops and my sister did the steak and scallops. When our food arrived it was drenched in what looked like dirty water they call their sauce. We told the waiter and he did nothing about it. We didnt even touch our meals it was terrible. We then paid and a manager then showed up. our checks both 50 dollars which we ate maybe 10 dollars worth was ridiculous. The manager came up to us with 10 dollar gift cards for each of us. Wow my meal was 27 alone and you think 10 dollars was enough. I had to leave that place and go find dinner somewhere else. I will never go back. If you like dirty water sauce and not fresh seafood then by all means enjoy but for me Nakama is the best of the best!!!",

WHY WHY WHY?\" i dont like hibachi. the food is bathed in butter and the whole show....cheesy. and we are in western PA, how good can the sushi/sashimi be? well....i was pleasantly surprised. the decor was nice, it was clean, and spacious. lucky for me we didnt sit in the hibachi section and we got seated right away and after reviewing their large menu we got the sushi, sashimi, and teriyaki dinners. the sashimi was great. good portions and good quality. the only thing that was annoying was the happy birthday song in a japanese accent? and disco lights that were coming from the hibachi section. but overall, the food is good here. and service is prompt.",

    "text": "Well, surprisingly good hibachi place right here in Monroeville, located interestingly at the Mall.  I've been here a couple times and have tried the sushi, which is okay, but this place is all about the hibachi. I took a group of 5 here on Thursday for my sis' bday lunch.  The restaurant itself is the nicest Hibachi restaurant in terms of decor in my opinion in greater pittsburgh, despite its location (with maybe the exception of the bathroom, which looks like it should be located at the cleveland airport).  The space is very fresh with great earthtones and your customary asian images.  The seating for hibachi is pretty spreadout and the regular tables are big and comfy.  The lunch prices are reasonable for $9 you can get the chicken hibachi, with veggies, rice, sauce, salad.  You can also get a combo for $14.  The service is better than most places I've been and everyone there seems to be asian of some type and well trained unlike Nakama.  The food is fresh and the cooks are well trained.  They interact with you a little more than other hibachi joints, but they actually seem to enjoy it.  If you are in m'ville and want hibachi this is a much better option than shogun, one last thing they really make a big deal about birthdays, so if you really want to embarass someone on their bday this is the place to go.  They turn down all the lights, turn on a disco ball, have the whole restaurant staff gather round you while this super cheesy bday / disco song places in the background and the whole restaurant is encouraged to clap.  They also have this nice flower type candle for the bday girl to blow out and serve with french fried ice cream.  This is a good addition.",

We ordered a sushi and chicken entree and it was absolutely horrible.  I do believe that gas station sushi would have been better than that.  The only items that were semi tolerable was the soup and salad.    I have nothing nice to say for the service either.  The only time we saw our waitress was when she took our order, brought drinks ONE time, and then brought the check.  We told her that the food was terrible and asked to speak with the manager.  She mumbled something and never returned.  We waited 15mins for someone to come and never saw no one.  We just left the cash for the bill on the table and left.    Needless to say we ended up leaving this establishment  hungry and with $35 less dollars in our pocket (not including the price I paid for the Groupon).",

    "text": "I've been here countless times for the hibachi , normal dine in, and take out. The food here is superb, sushi is great and in a great size. Great decor inside. Comfortable waiting seats. The timing is not long, it's just about right. The hibachi is a unique experience from other places I've been. From my experience, the chef will interact more with people like tossing food to aim at your mouth, or squirting sake out of a toy child's mouth. If you're shy, it may feel uncomfortable cause they try to really include everybody at the table. Very unique. However, my only negative concerns is that the front staff occasionally doesn't understand English well, which is fine, but due to misunderstandings , has messed up our orders a few times. They do promptly understand however and will give you what you correctly ask for which is great service. Also I don't like that you have to be placed with other strangers at a table. I get that the tables and grills are limited but idk, other places I've been to have a table for each guests and nobody is all placed at one table. It can be awkward and I've had bad experiences where overly drunk people just ruin the experience. Definitely recommend though this place instead of the food court if you happen to be in monroeville mall.",

    "text": "Sawa (now Saga) is another chinese-run hibachi/sushi combo places, that try to be entertaining.  While it may not be amazing, still beats most of the other places around the area.  Been here a few times, and a couple of things stick out: 1. that annoying chinese waiter/host guy with glasses who treats customers rudely and thinks he's funnier than he actually is 2. cool dinner seating (non-hibachi side) which you sort of climb-into, kinda feels like getting into those canoes you rent at the lake 3. the ridiculously fobby happy birthday song accompanied by a cheesy light show   Sushi was decent when I tried it, it was above average quality for the area.  (the deep fried Sawa roll is actually good)  For Hibachi, I was pleased -- mainly since the chef asked to add less soy sauce into the fried rice (since I was with a Chinese party), and overall the meat was not as salty as some other hibachi I've had.  Filet was good, but I recommend against the chicken.  I also sampled the salmon teriyaki - but the sauce was pretty unappetizing.   One might want to be wary of the \"no wait\" promise for Hibachi, which included 20 minutes of waiting area and 10-15 minutes before we got our chef.  Slightly annoying since our party included a 1 month old and also a 98 year old :)",

Also I ordered the combination box, with steak and shrimp. The steak had all the fat left on it and there was 3 shrimp, they try to make it up with the plate being filled with half right, veggies and noodles. The salad was the same as all, and the miso soup was relatively cold when it was brought out, also very clear and not much taste.

    "text": "Rating is only on the Hibachi table dining experience:   - Servings were smaller than some of the other hibachi places.  It seems every time we go to one of these restaurants, the veggie and meat portions get smaller.  - The chef was more entertaining than some of the other restaurants, although each of the 'surprises' are more predictable at every single place. It has a WOW factor if you've never been to one of these hibachi restaurants. So, how about changing it up guys?   - Not sure if I like the fact that the chef used the same utensils on beef, chicken and shrimp without wiping off his utensils at all.   - Best Value:  If you were having a birthday celebration (and I am only referring to those old enough to consume alcohol) then this might be a very entertaining placed to have that birthday bash. Gather about 10 people to sit around your table.  Then \"Get Ready, Set.....Open your mouth!\" The chef will take his sake in a squeeze bottle and squeeze it into your mouth from about 3 feet away while saying, \"More Sake, More Handsome\" and \"More Sake, more babies\" and other sayings.   All observed from a neighboring table. But then our chef asked our table if we wanted some, also. Only one couple participated. But as he was leaving, he made sure to stop at the party table to offer sake a la squeeze bottle too. All we could say was that we hoped the party had a designated driver with the amount squeezed into their mouths.    - Clean restrooms were a plus.  Recommendation:  Good for parties and that first time WOW factor if you've never been to a hibachi steakhouse.",

It's amazing to me that it's more difficult to find a gas station or grocery store that sells a 6 pack of ultra light beer in this state than it is to find terrible sashimi/sushi.  For those who aren't aware of the difference: sashimi is the fish in it's purest form. The best Japanese restaurants take pride in serving only top quality sashimi grade fish. Sushi is the fish you find either wrapped inside a sleeping bag of rice or placed sophisticatedly atop a bed of rice. Both require a better than average skill to make in excellent qualities and/or portions. Sushi/sashimi is an art form.  This is the 2nd \"Japanese\" restaurant I've visited in the area and I'm beginning to think a good quality Japanese restaurant just doesn't exist here.  Everything looked like it had been laying around for several hours. My sashimi platter was less than adequate and I didn't even want to finish it for fear of becoming ill.  The spicy salmon roll, which I don't normally order but was feeling frisky for, again looked like it had been made 3 hours ago and was served to me as if it were just made. Even my wasabi (which I LOVE) had a brownish tint as if it too had been sitting in the open air absorbing particles only God knows about.  My sake, while it came out nice and hot, was not the usual Gezekkan sake I'm accustomed to, and therefore by no fault of the restaurant for not having the brand I prefer, was just the icing on top of this nicely decorated but poor quality cake.  I'm sorry to those who have found this restaurant amazing for creating such a poor review but I'm writing to those who are avid sushi fans; you know who you are. The ones who venture outside of the California rolls, the dragon rolls, and the Philly rolls; I'm speaking to you. Steer clear.",

We usually like one more than another,  or maybe don't quite care for one.. but this night, we loved all 3. We ordered the Saga Monster Roll, the Rocking Volcano and the Phoenix.. and they were so so good! Our service was good, as well. One thing I love about getting sushi is that you can typically get in and out pretty quick, and this was no exception. We were seated immediately, served promptly, and of course, loved our food!",

A customer picked this sushi joint out and when we pulled up, I was like \"oh boy, this should be interesting\"  Getting past the mall issue, the restaurant is nicely decorated in the usual oriental stuff.  Friendly staff and very clean.  Nice sushi bar with a very large plasma flat screen.  Now for what rocked me.  The sushi was terrific, fresh and the presentation was awesome.  I cannot tell you the last time I tapped out of a sushi meal.  But these rolls were large, like large to the point, some at my table actually had to cut them in half.  I on the other hand shoved it all in my mouth :-).  The nigiri was like a fillet!  LoL, normally Unagi, Tuna, Salmon are bite size, well people, these cuts were fillet size, friggin large as hell.  I ate so much that I was kind of ill......  Note:  this is a good thing.  A couple of us had the hibachi, which was excellent too.    To bad, I do not visit Pittsburgh all that often, I could get used to eating at Saga!!!!!",

I typically give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, however, after 2 lousy experiences, as my boyfriend said, \"this place sucks.\" Apparently Saga is Japanese for lukewarm. The first time we went was because we had a Groupon. Apparently 2, $15 sushi rolls is not considered a dinner. Which if you want to play the fine print card, then fair game. So we went back, this time being sure to order 2 \"dinners.\" Both times my boyfriends tea was barely warm and the salad was drenched in water. Our food arrived fairly fast, however it wasn't until our food arrived that our waitress asked us which kind of rice we wanted. By the time we had finished our entrees, which were half cold, our rice was still not at our table. When we asked our waitress about it she said, \"I'm sorry, but my chefs don't speak English, so it's really hard to get them to make the rice.\" WHAT?! Needless to say, we will not be returning.",

Have you EVER ordered a spicy tuna roll and when it was served the tuna was ground, like hamburger?   I for one have never.   When I asked why the tuna was ground up and what the crunchy balls were, almost like uncooked tapioca beads, and why the rice and sushi was warm, the hostess told me \"I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE HAD SUSHI BEFORE.\"    We paid our 60.00$ bill for the food we could not eat and will never go back again.",

Everytime I've gone there to sit at a hibachi grill, it was clearly not cleaned. If it was, it was a gentle wipe at best. There is leftover food from previous meals fried to a crisp and sometimes sludge in the corners from cleaning the liquids at the end. Keep in mind, I've been to four or five hibachi places and have been to two of those five ten+ times; my favorite I go sometimes multiple times monthly. My point being I know how the grill should be cleaned and look. Here it's just not up to par and I don't like my food getting mixed with old burnt up rice from God knows when. Due to that cleanliness problem, I rate it a two.   It's a nice place, the decor is great and besides the very hard to understand waitresses the real problem is the cleanliness. Fix that up and I'll be back more often.",

The server then rang in and charged us for the wrong drink and when he fixed it he gauranteed that it would not be  charged twice but it did go through twice.

The chefs are quick, the servings are large and its all reasonably priced (compared to say, Nakama.) My favorite is their rainbow roll, but do try their daily specials. Everything is amazingly fresh!   Second, the hibachi.  Nothing incredibly special about the presentation or food, but all combinations are fairly priced and tasty.  My personal favorite is a hibachi staple, the steak and shrimp.  After Saga hibachi, I always leave full and happy, if with a slight case of indigestion.   Lastly, the Japanese \"dinners.\" They have several cook-to-order meals and appetizers. Their gyoza (dumplings) are some of the best I've ever had, and definitely try their noodle dishes if you haven't.  Service is (almost always) quick and friendly.  I docket them a star for a few times when service was EXTREMELY slow in the front table area.   Otherwise, it's a great place for Japanese food despite its mall location.",

Our hibachi chef was very entertaining and joked with us, making the whole experience better.  The rest of the waiting stuff was also on top of things and very helpful.  The food was tasty, even though I am not the biggest fan of asian flavors (and this is why I only gave it 3 stars) and I also did not order anything elaborate.  Hence, people with similar attitude  with me can try the place; I feel they will not be disappointed. Particularly the sauces that accompany the hibachi are very good! I got the chicken hibachi, while I also tried the beef and they were both good.  If I around the mall I will not bring any objection in visiting the place again.",

Nothing special, high prices and portions were kind of small. We took some fried rice home but the entrees were on the skimpy side.

You can sit on the hibachi side (where you sit through the chef's \"show\" of cooking your food and being cliche with the onion volcano, or you can sit on the other side of the restaurant near the bar/sushi bar and have a more intimate and quiet experience.  The booths look like they are about to call apart.  There are throw pillows on them to cover the holes.  The waitress said they are replacing the booths \"soon\" but they said that the last time I was in the restaurant about two months ago.  The hibachi side is loud and you will be seated with strangers.  The other side is a bit quieter but isn't overly appealing.  The menu has several pages of options.  Appetizers, sushi and sashimi, hibachi dishes (you can order hibachi entrees on the non hibachi side) and other entrees.  I've had sushi, hibachi and non hibachi entrees here.  Most have been decent, but not extremely memorable.  They do have great presentation, though.  Most entrees come with a small salad and miso soup.  Neither are overly exciting but are a nice start if you are hungry.    Servers are friendly, but they often have a very limited understanding of english, so it can be a challenge if you have questions about the menu or a request that isn't standard.    Watch for Groupon or Living Social deals as they often have them and you can basically get half off.  Overall it was enjoyable, but not my favorite hibachi experience in the Pittsburgh.",

When we finally get a chef he rushes to cook our food without proper seating and totally leaves one of the party with no fried rice.  We also realize that during this time our waitress had avoided our table as I am sure she didn't want to bring their screw up to our attention!  The manager's response is to offer us more drinks or desert.  We explain that we won't be able to eat more, and already have had enough to drink and yet tries to bring us more drinks.  Now I am not about to accept a DUI and more alcohol over poor service! The other family with us is completely ignored till the end.  Both the lady from the other family and my wife approach the manager that a discount should be offered.  His response is a smug look, no and a threat to call the police!  I am sure he could care less as they may have the traffic to remain open, however for a Friday night there was little to no wait and they were half full as it was.  Avoid at all costs and go to Yamato better service and food!",

Being a prior restaurant owner and in the field for years, I know that customer satisfaction should be above all else. They have never met or exceeded expectations. I have tried to give the benefit of the doubt as I have done with other places. The hibachi is okay at best. I have had it twice. The front waiter restaurant service is horrible. They are not friendly nor do they offer an attempt at good service. I have never had a good experience, either the food wasn't cooked properly, the food was cold or lacked flavor or taste. It is never crowded when I have gone, and see no reason for the service to be as poor as it is. The sushi was never wrapped tight enough and fell apart with the chop stick. The soup has been cold or luke warm at best.  The tea lacks taste all together. I am sure others have had a great experience and enjoy the place. I do not recommend this place nor will I return. My recommendation would be Yoko's in the Waterfront in Homestead.",

I have 3 girls and they were all fired up about watching him. Yes, I played the seal when he tossed food in the air and caught it in my mouth. Who said i don't have talent. ;)  Ok, my wife and I both went with the steak and shrimp. You get the rice, noodles, and veggies all cooked in front of you. The chef and server were great with the kids for you parents. They did the volcano of fire from sliced onions. They tossed me food, i performed. As a heads up a kids meal is $12 so keep that in mind. Either way,the service was great and they were on top of everything. A fun time for a date or a family function.",

She forgot to order our appetizer , she didn't understand 95% of what we said and I was late to sit down at the table and she stood over me rushing me to order food and beverage! I told her it was my first time there and she didn't understand she basically picked my dinner for me cuz she didn't understand I needed a few minutes to look at the menu! And she messed up people's checks at the end she was a hot mess!! Everyone else was really really friendly and we had a great time celebrating our friends birthday there!

    "text": "A succinct review...  The good: The hibachi chefs are friendly.  The bad: The decor was dark and old The sushi was poor quality; the spicy salmon and spicy tuna were notably low grade The salad was unappetizing, and the dressing tasted worse The soup was bland  Took over 30 minutes for the chef to arrive, even though there was only 1 other table of guests.  The wait staff don't speak English well enough to properly serve a restaurant; I asked for regular soy sauce, instead of the 2 bottles of low sodium soy sauce, and it took 2 different people before I was understood  I've been here twice, and my second visit was my worst experience at a hibachi steakhouse. I advised the manager and the hostess that I had to leave in 45 minutes. Either they didn't understand or care, because I left without even the shrimp appetizer being prepared. There are much better places in Pittsburgh to get hibachi. Unfortunately, if you live near Monroeville, you'll just have to drive a bit to get to them.",

Knowing this deal, our bar was set fairly low. Mall sushi, and discounted.   However, the food surpassed expectations!   Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by the bartender (who was located right next to the host stand). The place is a stand-alone restauraunt, not necessarily 'in' the mall itself. It has a nice aesthetic, and the hibachi is separated from those eating sushi. We were taken to an area with booths, and although the seating was limited on this side, we were seated immediately and did not feel crowded.   We ordered a lot: a spicy tuna roll, the valentine roll, a spicy salmon roll, and regular roll,  and an order of crab rangoons (which were not discounted). In addition to a daquiri, our total bill was ~$42  That's a steal!  The food came out SO fast, and was delicious! We will absolutely be coming back on Monday's because the deal is too good to pass, for such good sushi!",

Fail to check on the table until it's too late to  fix it, so they're stuck with the incorrect order.  3. When the server comes by and is told of the problem, don't apologize. Say \"I can still get what you're missing\" even though the customer - my son - is basically done eating. It's too late. 4. When the manager breezes by to check on the table, he should chuckle and smile about the issue, then again offer the missing items, though the meal is done. Offer it as take out. We didn't come to the restaurant for take out, but toss it out there anyway. Then, ask the customer to tell you how to make it right, because that's the now angry customer's job...to fix your screwup. 5. Never address the kid whose order was goofed up. Never actually say something like \"Young man, I am sorry your food was incorrect. It was our fault and there is no excuse for it.\". 6. Act like giving the customer a 10% discount fixes it. Guess what - not even close. Saga Hibachi... you'll close soon, I bet, just like the rest of that old mall. We've patronized your restaurant plenty of times, and you used to do a lot better. You have gone downhill, if our visit....our last visit...is any indication.",

Manager would not let us look at cameras but claimed he watched them and saw nothing. Needless to say, we cancelled that cc immediately and reported it stolen there.",

    "text": "The food was good, as it is always at any Saga. I was meeting with a friend I hadn't seen in three years. Big reunion. I drove an hour from Monaca to meet him for dinner. He wanted sushi, I wanted hibachi. The host didn't seem to understand so my friend said \"I'll get hibachi too\" and we were escorted to the hibachi side. I was fine with it initially as it looked like we would be alone. After we finished our soup and salad they brought four teenage girls to our table who then took their time ordering. I was asking my friend if we could move to our own table and the waiter overheard us. He told us to tell the chef. We asked the chef who urged us to stay and told us we could move once the food was done. He cooked then left and we weren't sure what to do so we reluctantly ate next to the girls who were taking photos of their food/being typical annoying teen girls and at one point were talking to some guy on speaker phone. We told both the waiter and the chef that we would prefer to be at a private table and were not allowed to move.  Not a good experience.",

    "text": "Omg! This food was so delicious, so amazing, no lie I was closing my eyes in pleasure enjoying the moment. The prices are affordable, especially the lunch specials. I shared a exotic Blue Hawaiian drink with my husband and it was perfect. The chef was great and fun. Went here for my husband's birthday yesterday and we really enjoyed it. Was not crowded, only one other couple at the table with us. Waiter and chef did not take long to get food started or to wait on us. Our 2 little ones were with us and of course they didn't want what we were eating so we stopped at fast food beforehand and they let the kids bring their food in with them. Amazing staff and great atmosphere. Restaurant was also clean.",

    "text": "Not even sure where I should start with this review...  We made reservations for 7:oo pm on a Monday evening for a party of 13. The restaurant was bare...that should have been my first clue!  Our server was unfriendly and should not be working in the service industry. He barley spoke 3 words to us the entire dinner.  I had to ask him for a glass of water 4 times (and 20 minutes later) before he finally remembered to bring it.  We ordered sushi and it was delivered without soy sauce or chop sticks. Again I had to ask for soy sauce 3 times before he remembered.  I had to get up and go to the bar for refills on our drinks because our waiter was MIA. When I mentioned to the bartender how dissatisfied I was with the service he said he would tell his manager. Typically the manager would then come to the table... but not this place. The owner could have cared less and just blew me off when I brought it up to him. His response was \"Yeah, Yeah I fire him tomorrow\" and brushed me away with his hand. This is not acceptable and you do not speak to a paying customer like this.   Then comes paying the bill... The owner of this place ran my friends PNC credit card through the machine so many times that PNC actually called her while we were trying to pay. He was swiping the card instead of inserting the chip into the card reader and she was being charged every time he swiped the card. They put a hold on her card and she had no other form of payment so... what does the owner do??? He calls the Monroeville Police Department. She had no other form of payment so we offered to pay her check with our card and he actually refused!  Another sign of a poor establishment...when you see %18 gratuity will be added to parties of 4 or more printed on the menu. If you need to add gratuity to parties of 4 or more you must be doing something wrong.  Upon leaving the kids noticed there were fish in a pond by the door.  There was barley any water in the pond and the water that was in there was absolutely filthy. I am beginning to wonder if this is the fish they use for the sushi??  This place is overpriced, dirty and the portion size is small. If you want good service and good food at a reasonable price then you need to visit Edo Hibachi behind Westmoreland Mall...and kids eat free every Sunday.",

    "text": "Tonight will be my LAST and FINAL time eating at this Saga Japanese Steak House restaurant. We arrived prior to closing time at 10:15pm, and restaurant doesn't close until 11:00pm Friday's. We were served cold soup, and immediately after are hibachi chef served our food we were bombarded with checks. We were given inadequate time to eat and they were very RUDE and IMPATIENT when asking for boxes, to go sauces, etc. The manager seemed very bother by our presence and when asked for to go sauces he threw them on the opposite side of the table and asked rudely \"is there anything else\".  They even began cutting off lights and told us to hurry up and RUSHED us along, and continued to stare at us as we were trying to enjoy our food. We were followed to the door by the manager, and the manager and his staff refused to respond when we spoke to them telling them thank you and have a great night.",

I first went here my graduation dinner, and the staff happily seated us around the table with another family. We went here again for another family outing. Hibachi can be expensive, but the lunch prices are certainly reasonable. The menu consists of several options. Each time we've gone here, we've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. I just love the hibachi experience, and Saga certainly does it well. The soup is delicious; I don't care too much for the salad dressing but hey to each his/her own!",
