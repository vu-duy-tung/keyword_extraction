The soup tasted a bit off, and I only had a few bites, but it was enough.  Today I have done nothing but puke.  In fairness, we ordered three different dishes last night, and nobody else in my family is throwing up today, so if you think that two out of three ain't bad, Tamarind might be just the place for you.",

I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem. Okay.. i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i'd consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet, that's a problem.   c'mon its chicken tikka masala. make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself. this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel.   the one star is there for the excellent service. who was also nice enough to leave his name, Martin (standup fellow) and number (i wouldn't be so cruel) on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell",

    "text": "I love indian food and I consider Tamarind as Pittsburgh's one of the best indian places. The portions are generous and service is great.   I got the usual chicken tikki masala and the sauce was great to dip in my garlic naan. My bf got some lamb dish with green sauce ( I dont remember the name) which had unique great flavor as well. I asked my dish to be spicy but it was not. I know I am pretty good with spicy food but I know how HOT Indian food can get. So this one thing put me down a little on my visit but other than this, the soft chicken went well with fluffy white rice warm naan. The lamb was tender too and didn't give off that \"lamb smell\" much.   Everytime I go back to Pittsburgh, Tamarind is always on my \"must go back\" list.  The staff will greet you kindly, prices are reasonable for the generous portions, and the food comes out quick enough so you don't start to get frustrated.   I would give 3.5 stars. Even though it is my fav indian place in Pittsburgh, I feel like there is a better place somewhere out there. So as of now, it is a 3.5 for me~",

    "text": "I will have to revise my scale after eating here for six months I can say that this is by far the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.    Dosa:  well done, crispy (as it should be), spiced to perfection.  I love the pickles and chutneys they serve it with.  As far as I know this is the only place that serves dosa in Pittsburgh.  The curries:  I have tried the mutter paneer, the saag paneer, the aloo gobi among others.  As far as I can tell this is an extremely consistent restaurant (huge sucker for consistency).  They spice the dishes well, have good portions, and aren't afraid to ad the heat when you ask for it (it is hard to get 'hot' in Pittsburgh in my experience).   The naan are well done and appropriately buttery.  The samosas appear to be handmade and are excellent as well:  always crispy and hot and filled with a spiced potato and pea mixture.  The chutneys are, also as far as I can tell, freshly made at least with regard to the cilantro chutney.  Love this place!",

My husband ordered the chicken tikka masala and he loved it. Our friend ordered the chettinadu chicken with coconut milk. 7 out of 10 spice. She said it didn't have a heavy coconut flavor. She also loved her dish. All entrees come with rice. I also ordered yummy hot chai. I am in love with the place, dreaming about it. Every trip to Pittsburgh will include a stop to Tamarind. We went on Saturday at 5pm and parked on the street at the meters. We didn't put any money in the meter & noticed no one else did either.",

The service was nice, if a little bit slow. The mango lassi was delicious. We'd come back when in the area and try the  dosa or some of the creative ideas (Indian shrimp? Interesting, and worth a try) but our go to Indian will still be Udipi Cafe.",

Sauces are creamy and flavorful, while chunks of meat are tender and sizable.  The one caveat: during lunch, you can only get the buffet (no individual ordering)--and on weekdays, the buffet is a little below average at best.  Avoid lunches Monday through Friday and you'll do just fine.",

The food was good however extremely limited compared to Savoring India's buffet.  I loved the eggplant pakora dish with fried chickpeas. The dosa was also crispy and delicious. The food was spicyyy which I LOVE. The price was right too ($10 for a lunch buffet). Compared to NYC where I live, the prices on the regular menu don't seem too bad but maybe it's steep compared to other places in PGH. My boyfriend was disappointed that there were no lamb dishes at the buffet which Savoring India had at theirs.  I'll be back for sure to try other things on the menu.",

On being seated we were quickly greeted by our server who was attentive and friendly. We decided to try the kebabs & some Indo-Chinese dishes. The kebabas.. were delicious! I absolutely loved the sheekh kebab! It was flavorful, succulent with the essentials a great kebab should have! We also tried the tandoori chicken which was pretty good.   From the Indo-Chinese cuisine, which is basically Chinese food cooked with Indian spices, we tried the chicken 65 & fried rice. These were good but extremely spicy for my palate even though we requested medium spicy food. I wished it was less spicy so I could have tasted more of these dishes instead of washing my bites with water and mango lassi. My friend on the other hand, who has a better spice tolerance devoured his meal.   Overall, it was a good experience... especially for the price. Will definitely come back for more!",

The door leading to the bathrooms was an industrial style one with a large push bar. You know the kinda door that looks like a fire exit. The kitchen happened to be located behind this same door which made me a little weary.    I was craving tamarind sauce when I came here and since this place is called \"Tamarind\" flavor of indian I was expecting some great sauce. We order a samosa appetizer, Biryani rice and chicken tandoori. When our appetizer came out it was accompanied by three different sauces: tamarind, mint and coconut chutneys. The only upside to eating here was that the samosa tasted really good. The breading wasn't too thick and it was nice and crispy but the sauces where horrible. The only one I enjoyed was the white coconut chutney. The mint sauce was watered down with no flavor and the tamarind tasted like sweet spaghetti sauce. The tamarind sauces I've tried have always had a nice rich flavor and are dark and thick like honey or honey-like. This sauce was so thin and tasted nothing like tamarind sauce at all. It almost tasted like it had a ketchup base which disgusted me.  I was so disappointed by this sauces that I had the waitress cancel my dinner order. I was going to cancel the whole order but when I approached her she already had the samosa in hand. Although the samosa was good I don't see myself coming back here unless they get some new sauce.",

And the ambiance is good too - they play really classic south Indian songs on a low volume inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "I went on Sunday for their buffet lunch and it was SO good. We went because my Indian friend says it's one of the only Indian restaurants he likes in Pittsburgh. It did not disappoint.   The selection for the lunch buffet is quite authentic and a mix of south and north Indian cuisine. They have naan, rice, curries, chutneys, a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes, and will bring out dosa to your table. Everything was really flavorful. I feel like it was helpful going with someone who is familiar with the cuisine because they had a number of dishes I wasn't too familiar with, even though I have traveled in India before and have frequented Indian restaurants in the past.   I'm giving this place five stars because the service is good, ambiance is nice, price is great (a little under $10 for the lunch buffet), and the food is fantastic. Such a unique and varied selection that I don't normally see elsewhere. (Makes it a fun meal if you're into trying new foods.) I'm definitely planning to go back soon!",

    "text": "I had been bemoaning the lack of good Indian food in Pittsburgh, as I felt like there was an embarrassment of good options in Boston, so my partner was like, \"Wait, I haven't taken you to Tamarind yet?\"  Tamarind is located in a renovated house, with very high ceilings, and unsurprisingly has a homey, but classy, environment.    I ordered a mango lassi, the chicken vindaloo, and garlic naan.  The mango lassi was a little sweet for my tastes, and I worried because they didn't ask me how hot I wanted the vindaloo: at a lot of ethnic places that means you get tourist or anglo-level heat, or \"mild\".  But when the vindaloo came out it was fragrant and super spicy.  Enough to make my scalp itch [when I told my partner, she though I was a lunatic, so am I the only one who rates the spiciness of food by whether the sweat beads up and my head itches a little?].  Suddenly the sweetness of the mango lassi was just right!  More importantly, as well as being spicy it was delicious. The garlic naan was also tasty.    I will definitely go back.  I have to try the \"Chicken 65\", described as marinated, fried chicken, there take on a classicl Indian street food.  While we were there, a party of about 15 people came in, all speaking Hindi to each other, and they ordered half a dozen plates of what I assume was the Chicken 65 to share: I need to get some of that!",

The paneer tikka masala was RED. I think that's food color, but could be wrong. Was not bad but I wasn't impressed. The chettinad was also decent. Like I said, decent food. Nothing bad.

It's like you are eating at someone's house, which is really cool, cause honestly, I prefer eating at home or at someone's house as opposed to a restaurant.  I've eaten at People's in Garfield and the old India House, and they don't even begin to compare.  Their portions are big, and you always have some leftover at the end of the meal.  And I eat a lot, so that's saying something.  I basically gluttonous as an eater.  Anyhow, I digress.  Go there, it's not too pricey, the service is ALWAYS good, and they always make sure you have enough water.  I wish I could remember what I get, but I can't.  It's always something Paneer (chicken or cheese).  Their nan is always perfect, like they just baked it in a old hearth.  YUM!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Sunday night, our second time since first eating at Tamarind last April.  Due to a few miscommunications, our second experience was a bit more negative than our first, after which we had initially felt as if we had found our go-to Indian restaurant located very conveniently near us.  We had a reservation for our party of 6, which turned out to be handy, as the small dining room was full throughout most of our meal.  We loved the ambiance of the space in a renovated house, which was a bit noisy with all the tables filled but very homey feeling.  Our group of 3 couples each opted to do the Sunday night special of \"Dinner for 2\" for $25: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a bread (lamb, seafood, and bread basket excluded).  Chose the Chilly Gobi for the appetizer, expecting a stir-fried dish, as the menu describes this as \"sauteed.\"  It came battered and deep-fried.  I verified with a server that this was the Chilly Gobi, as I thought maybe they had given me the Gobi Manchurian instead, a dish that the menu describes as \"battered cauliflower,\" which I would understand to denote deep-frying.  The server responded that my dish was indeed the Chilly Gobi, and that it was typically deep-fried as all \"Manchurian-like\" dishes tend to be.  I was disappointed, as I find this assumption to be a disconnect from how the menu describes the preparation.  If one dish is \"sauteed\" and another is \"battered\", it does not logically follow to me that both would be deep-fried.  The dish tasted great, but was just not what I wanted--I would have ordered something else had I been aware of this ahead of time.  We ordered the Kadai with okra and the Tikka Masala with paneer for entrees.  The Kadai was a repeat order from our first visit, as I had enjoyed it immensely, but it came out much oilier than I had remembered.  It was still tasty, but after eating about a third of the dish, the rest was just sitting in a pool of sauce that was essentially just oil, rendering it a bit unappetizing.  Our Tikka Masala was tasty and fairly standard, but could have used more spices and depth of flavor, rather than just being very plainly sweet.  Our friends ordered a Saag, an Aloo Gobi, a Vindaloo with chicken, and a Madras Masala Dosa, and seemed to really enjoy them.  In particular, the Saag was raved about, and the Dosa came wonderfully presented as a huge serving, cut into 4 pieces, though we were told it was the \"small\" portion.  Our table received our 3 orders of naan (2 garlic, 1 onion) combined in one basket but was not informed whether the basket was a single portion or combined for our entire table until we asked for verification.  The naan was very pleasantly fragrant and a great complement to our saucy Tikka Masala.  Our final small miscommunication came with the bill, on which I tried to use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> deal I had purchased: $6 for $15 worth of food.  I was told that I could not combine this coupon with the Sunday Night \"Dinner for 2\" deal.  I understand that it is often the case that discount offers can be combined, but I had verified this before purchasing the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon, and neither the stipulations for said coupon nor the \"Dinner for 2\" deal on Tamarind's menu stated that either offer couldn't be combined with another.  Such restrictions should be made transparent.  TL;DR the food is decent, but service leaves something to be desired.  We might be back due to its convenient location, but I now feel much more incentive to try All India one block up Craig St.",

    "text": "SETTING Cute Victorian house with hardwood floors. Well lit and has enough space for small to medium parties. Casual. Feels like I am dining at a relative's house!  FOOD Came for the \"Sunday Dinner for Two\" deal: 1 appetizer + 2 entrees + 1 bread (all for $25). Seriously, what a fantastic deal! Definitely filling too.  Went with the Gobi Manchurian for the app. I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower because it looks like a mini albino tree and tastes like cardboard. That being said, if cauliflower was always done this way, then these albino trees would be deforested in a minute. Crunchy and delicious.   First time I had Channa Batura and it was great! It was like a big puffy bread that could be peeled/ripped apart and dipped in the chickpea curry. Chickpeas are tasty and they have a cute name. Chickpea IN curry? Count me in.  I'm a big fan of Saag because I like spinach and Popeye the sailor man. Chicken Saag was rich and just the right amount of creamy. Good quantity of tender chicken as well.   SERVICE  Waiters are knowledgeable about the menu and describe the dishes well if you have trouble understanding what you are ordering. Nice people. Very mellow and quiet personalities, which go with the atmosphere of this place.  IMPRESSION Convenient location and high quality food (with good deals on certain days) makes this place a must-visit if you are a fan of indian cuisine. Personally, I enjoy coming here for their deals and quality dishes, but I also enjoy their arch nemesis down the street if I am solely in the mood for buffet (more offerings there).   Not much parking except in their \"driveway\". Oh, and I've always wondered what's upstairs...anyone know? A hidden albino forest, perhaps? *smacks lips*",

    "text": "I've been here several times, mostly for dinner and once for Sun. brunch buffet.  My most recent visit was in Mar. on a weeknight.  During my most recent visit, my dining companion and I ordered the dosas.  They were much larger than expected, and quite filling, if a bit on the bland side.  We also ordered the vegetable naan, which I wasn't so much a fan of (I don't like crunchiness in my naan), but I've had other naans here and they've been good, so I think this is a personal preference.  Whenever I visit an Indian restaurant, I always order a mango lassi, so I did so here, and it was a nice accompaniment to my meal.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken tandoori as my entree, and it was quite pleasing.  I particularly liked how the chicken was brought to my table sizzling--clearly, fresh out of the tandoor oven.  I found it to be well-seasoned and delectable, with a beautiful red coating.  I like some heat to my food but not too much, so I usually order a spice level of 4/10.  On previous trips, I've ordered the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer, both of which were good, though I don't remember as much about them.  My favorite dish, however, is the chicken makhani, which I've sampled from friends who've ordered it.  Next time I go, I'll have to order it as my entree!  I don't remember as much about the buffet, except for that the food was decent, albeit not as good as the a la carte dinner entrees I've had.  However, there was a lot more of it, so I was able to sample some foods I wouldn't have otherwise tried.  If you go to the brunch, you certainly won't leave hungry!  Service has always been decent.  The atmosphere is particularly cozy and romantic, given that it's located in a converted Victorian house.  It's a great date spot!",

I was taken by the layout immediately.  Then the food.  It's a pretty large buffet for an Indian buffet and the food was amazing, even my Indian friend begrudgingly noted it's superior quality.  Everything there was amazing, even for vegetarians! It was a little lacking in the Indian sweets though...I would try everything, except the salad. Why would you go to a buffet for a salad?",

There were flies flying around and it was irritating.   That was still ok because the food served was pathetic. I ordered a Gobi Manchurian which was average, chicken chettinadu which was overloaded with black pepper. It was not like I have never had these dishes before anywhere so I know how it tastes.   The server while taking the order did not ask for the spice level and assumed that we would love very spicy food. All in all it was a bad experience.  My friend too did not like his signature biryani since it was very very spicy.  Both of us got very bad stomach aches after eating here. I have been to the Greentree one and that one is excellent. This one is just pathetic.",

For 10 dollar there isn't much to complain. The food was good but the options weren't traditional, they didn't have a single paneer dish on the buffet that day.

I also had the vegetable vindaloo (fantastic), a chickpea dish that wasn't Chana masala (good), rice (meh), a potato dish (blah), and the naan (zzzzz). I was hoping they would have chicken tikka masala or chicken makhani, but they did not have this at the buffet.

Everything was yummy. The Paneer Saag was also good (I've developed a soft spot for saag). However, the third dish we ordered (I can't remember what it was called) contained fruit (canned, I think) and was sweet, which we weren't expecting. I didn't like it as much as the other dishes.  The food was good but a little expensive for me to eat there regularly. Our order lasted us for two meals, though. Also, the food would've been better if we ate it fresh.

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic.  We stopped in here on a Saturday because we were in town for another event  - since it's the Holiday Season, the pay lot up the street even had free parking.  Bonus!  Unfortunately, they didn't open until 5 PM, so we had to wait a couple minutes beforehand, but it was well worth it.  We were actually the first ones in the door.  I'm not going to talk about the ambiance/setting - others have pretty well covered this.  The kitchen was a little slow with our food, but the tableside service was still good.  I can't complain that much about the kitchen - as soon as we sat down, 5 other tables filled up right behind us.  While others got their appetizers and meals before us, we didn't mind because their food seemed a little less complicated to make, and I can understand the restaurant's approach of trying to make as many patrons happy as fast as they can.  But we did wait at least 30 minutes for our orders to come out (hence, the one star deduction).  Again - well worth the wait.  I had the Curry Goat; super flavorful; my only complaint is the amount of bones that came with it.  My dining partners had the Chicken Makhani (with tomato & cream sauce; it was delicious), and the Chicken Saag with spinach.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The waiter came over and even asked if the spiciness was OK,...as if he could read our minds, especially since one of us experiences chronic indigestion.  She was fine throughout the meal and even after.  They were out of Naan bread, so they provided us a couple orders of other dipping bread, perfect to sop up all the leftover sauce.  They didn't push drinks on us; the water was fine and was refilled several times over.  The big question:  would we go back?  Absolutely.  Even through we live about an hour away, we agreed we would drive that far just to come to this restaurant and try out more items.",

The waiter never asked if we wanted anything else to drink but water sufficed. The menu has plenty of choices without being overwhelming and there is something for everyone. We had plenty of time to look it over, actually a little too much time, it took a while to snag someone's attention to take our orders. Our food came in a decent time and was a good portion. I ordered chicken korma, it was mild and probably a new favorite dish! I loved the flavors. My boyfriend ordered the chilly chicken and said it was incredibly spicy but he was equally as satisfied with his choice. We will absolutely be back for another meal soon!",

I ordered the paneer tikka masala. The sauce was nice a rich and the meal came with rice and dal. The dal was nice a light making it a great pairing with the paneer. The rice was regular jasmine rice.   Only issue I have had at this place was that the waiter was charging me extra for a side item that came with my meal and was charging me for the item because the menu had a misprint. That was slightly annoying to deal with.",

Also, the wait times for the food is ramped up, so it is extremely slow.  It's almost as if they only have one chef in the kitchen, which is a possibility.  For example, we were going to order a dessert, but by the time we were served and ate it was so late I didn't want to eat because I thought it might be midnight before I get the dessert.  Yah, if you have the time and the patience the food is really good.  Oh, the waiter did not ask my girlfriend for a spice level and when the food came out her dish was way too spicey for her.  So, that was a slip up on their part.  The service does need some work.  Maybe if you go on a week night the service would be better?",

There were 2 servers and we had to flag one down each time we wanted something.

Their buffet is great with a wide variety of options and even some non veg options. It is constantly loaded with biriyani, paneer, vegetable dishes, and chicken entrees as well.   I have also come for dinner and enjoyed their food. The chilli chicken is pretty good and flavorful. The chicken 65 is just small pieces of chicken in a very red seasoning. Their chicken biriyani is standard saffron rice with chicken nothing special but decent. The chicken makhani is also creamy and tasty. Their dosas though are unimpressive compared to the size of Udipi's.  Overall, their food is pretty good and satisfies that fresh Indian food craving. Also a great place to get takeout.",

We ordered a bread basket for the table and food was shared all around! I recommend getting a cup of masala chai tea at the end of your meal, a lovely way to finish things off.

I expect a little more customer service and a person to take care of customers. Usually place seems to be busy though  This is my Second time. I came here for buffet. I was but disappointed. I want to mention few little things which can improve your rating.  Few items are cooked and were not refilled. Couple of Plates weren't cleaned properly, it was with food particles. I would suggest you please keep a extra staff who can refill things and food and Amongst all items only chicken , shrimp ( though served late after asking couple of times) and mutton Biryani were yummy rest They weren't tasty. Idli was refilled late and dosa was satisfying. Chutney for it not up-to the taste I expected. Desert no  good at all. I was expecting the Mango lassi. But that too was finished. Finally they don't have spoons and forks to eat. I end up eating the desert with my hand. When I asked for answer was negligent. I don't suggest that this place is good for buffet unless you go for the first hour. And don't go with high expectations. And if you want more items in buffet and no wait time for the table to serve. Better try All Indian restaurant. You will feel happy satisfied.",

My entree consisted of the \"Chicken Makhani\" with a side of assorted breads. The sauce on the Makhani was perfectly thick and flavored and coagulated well with the rice to create easily assembled bite after easily assembled bite.

Not only did they help us get un-lost in the middle of downtown P-Burgh, the staff was exceptionally nice and attentive, and the food was just great. We ordered the Saag Ghosht (spinach and lamb), and the potato/garbanzo bean dealy, and some garlic naan. It was BYOB, but since we were on the road we had just water and mango lassi. If I had to complain about something, it would be the small size of the lassis, but this is only because I'm a calorie-vacuuming American. Whew, good to get that off my gigantic chest.

Don't go in expecting your traditional Americanized Indian Fare, the restaurant has a more limited menu that focuses on artfully prepared sauces. The food quality is excellent, with moderate portions. The prices are fair, but more expensive than other Indian in the city. The decor is elegant and modern, with nice views, if only of Craig St. Parking is very limited, and the neighboring Centre Ave area doesn't attract the most savory characters.",

    "text": "First of all, the old house this restaurant is in is so cool. I read on the wall that it is over 100 years old. It had good vibes. Now, I had my groupon and this was my first Indian experience. I was a bit nervous since I'm a picky eater and didn't really know what was in each dish. I'm also a vegetarian/vegan, so I was concerned that what I ordered could be a meat dish. I did some research beforehand though. The restaurant is BYOB, and for you groupon users, you have to be sure to make a reservation or else they won't honor it. (This may be only on weekends, and they weren't very strict about it - but a head's up). The setting was nice, with intimate dim lighting at the front for small parties, but brighter in the middle where larger groups were being seated. Our server was really sweet, helpful and patient while answering my questions and helping my pronunciation. We got the Channa Batura as a starter, which was a delicious chick pea curry sauce and puffy bread right from the oven. SO GOOD! My date got the Chilly Chicken and his mouth was on fire, but he said it was very good. I got the Veg Kofta, which were kind of like little falafels in a nice sauce. I got a side of more chickpeas (kinda obsessed with these guys) and date got the delish lentil soup. All in all I was totally into my meal, and happy that Tamarind took my indian food virginity :)",

I have been several times, and I'm continually impressed.  It is a bit more expensive than some of the other Indian restaurants close by, but so worth it!  The dosas are delicious, and so are their curries.  An Indian friend considered it the most authentic Indian place in Pittsburgh.  Like most Indian restaurants, they also have a great vegetarian selection; even non-vegetarians should consider branching out and trying a dish sometime.  It's a great place for a date, but serves well for large groups and friends.  They also have meal specials on Tuesdays or Wednesdays for students (I can't remember the exact day).",

There's a good variety of flavor levels, as well as vegetarian and meat options.  I've gotten take out once in the evening and it was awesome.

I asked for recommendations on which curry to get with lamb, emphasizing that I didn't want anything spicy, and ended up with the South Indian style curry. I scooped up the curry to put on my rice, took a bite, and then followed up with a gulp of water because it was actually spicy! :( It had huge chunks of tender lamb, and it would have been great if it were mild. I ended up switching with my boyfriend's chicken tikka masala, which was a little too sweet compared to what I was used to. The garlic naan was fluffy and also crispy at the edges, but the garlic flavor was a bit faint. When we were done eating, we were asked 3 times if we wanted to box the food to go, but we didn't want to bring home two chunks of chicken and lamb with a little bit of curry and no rice to eat it with. We laughed about it afterward, thinking we would have just taken the food home to satisfy them if they had asked one more time.",

The food is well seasoned and not overly greasy like a lot of other Indian places around here tend to be.  The prices are reasonable, especially for the portions.  I can easily take half my entree home if I order an appetizer and bread too.  I tend to stick with the Chicken Tikka Masala, but I've had their Chicken Biryani too, no complaints there.  Their samosas can't be beat either.  The place is a bit small, and their staff is decent but not outstanding.  Oh yeah, and watch out, they're closed on Mondays!  I found that one out the hard way.",

No seasoning, no spices of any kind. Because I live in the area I was really hoping this restaurant would be good. For some reason all of the India restaurants that I've tried in Oakland have been HORRIBLE. The best India restaurant, in my opinion, is India Palace downtown. Awesome food.

Lemon flavored rice was very good. I tried everything - the eggplant dish was good, tandoori chicken good, veggie curry was okay.  Chick pea dish was very good.

It's clean and well kept with hardwood floors and maybe a dozen tables.  The art on the walls caught our attention right away.  There were two large paintings of flowers, one with the anatomy of the flower below, as you might find it in a biology text book.  They were bright and strong and a pleasure to look at while eating.  We took a look at the menu, and I was pleased to see there was a large vegetarian section.  I forget the full name of my dish, but it was potato cauliflower curry and it had fresh cilantro and ginger in it.  I ordered the medium and I wish it had been a little hotter.  I ordered a roti to go with it, but was disappointed that it appeared to be made out of white flour, though the menu said it was to be whole wheat.  My dinner compadres ordered channa masala and a lamb dish and some creamy vegetable curry.  I tried the channa masala, it was okay, but again, could have used some kick.  I know what you're thinking... if you like kick, order HOT!  Well... the lamb dish we got was hot, uncomfortably so.  Apparently what we wanted is medium-hot.  Oh well... you never know on your first visit to a restaurant what they mean when they say hot.  This place gets four stars because the meals were fresh and the service was prompt and courteous.  I'll defiantly go back again, and next time ask for medium-hot.",

I always order the shrimp korma and over the course of the last few months, maybe year, it has completely changed. The korma sauce is a different color (used be more orange and now it's brown), it has chunks of veggies in it (it was a thick but chunkless sauce before), the spices are different and way too strong. It seriously tastes nothing like the original that has kept me coming back for more (monthly, sometimes weekly!) for 8 years. This was my go-to take out spot and the only Indian in our city that I'd eat. Help!",

The naan came with four pieces and I wish I had ordered my own instead of sharing it! The pieces were a little small so one order can potentially feed one person, if you have a big appetite (like me.) The naan came with three different dipping sauces and they're were all delicious! One was a white yogurt sauce, a spicy ketchup tasting one and a green zesty one.   The chicken tikka masala was so good! I wish it came with more rice though! The ratio between meat and sauce and rice wasn't even in my opinion. The meal came with the meat, vegetables and sauce in a little dish along with rice and this zesty sauce. It was delicious! The sauce was creamy and yogurty! And the chicken was so tender and flavorful!   This restaurant is truly a gem, come check it out!",

But when some friends invited me out to Tamarind, I decided to give Indian food another try.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was so good that I swear it's the only thing I ever want to eat again in my entire life. It was truly one of the top 5 best things I've ever eaten, without a doubt. The sauce was creamy, rich, and flavorful, the chicken was cooked beautifully, and it was just absolutely amazing overall. I've also had their Chicken Vindaloo which is spicy and delicious, and their Chicken 65 starter was really delicious too and came with this really lovely mint chutney. Their garlic naan is also exceptionally good.  The restaurant itself is in this beautiful house and while the environment was a bit noisy at times, the restaurant was clean and all of the staff were very nice and attentive so it was a nice experience eating there.  Everything I've eaten from Tamarind has been incredible and I will absolutely be ordering from them again many more times in the future. I definitely can't say that I don't like Indian food anymore now that I've eaten at this amazing place!",

    "text": "I have to say that I've had mixed experiences here. The meals I've had have been hit-or miss, but the buffets have always been satisfying (as long as I don't arrive at the end of it!). One of the first dishes I've got from here was vegetable Chettinad, an item not often on Indian menus, and for good reason. It's not terrible, but I imagine most people would never find occasion to order it a second time, as is the case with me. I quite enjoyed the presentation and taste of the navrattan korma, which is very nicely topped with a cherry that adds to the dish in a pleasantly different way. However, I can't get past the notion that the ingredients are rather cheap-ish; while I cannot be sure, I get the impression that the vegetables are canned, as are many of the tomato-based sauces I find myself eating. Very recently I also had a mango lassee that was somehow off... at first it was served to me warm, which my waiter happily corrected, but even chilled, it had a syrupy texture, and less yogurt-y like I had wanted. Part of the premise behind ordering a mango lassee is so the dairy in the beverage neutralizes the acidity/spiciness of what you're eating. I didn't have to wait for my food to arrive to realizing what I was served would fail to serve that role. The waiter, however, was very accommodating and took it off my bill. Yet I feel that lassees I've had in the past were just fine. I realize this may be a silly thing to split hairs over, but it confuses me nonetheless.  I'm willing to take this in stride, though. Tamarind is in a very good location, and has very low prices, especially with the buffet. A common trend among restaurants is that lower menu prices correlate with cheaper ingredients, and Tamarind is no exception. I still have to qualify that the food here is still much better than other Pittsburgh-area Indian restaurants that share its price level. Because of this, I don't find it too hard to  look past this reality and simply allow myself to enjoy the experience.",

There were a few people waiting in the foyer and the waiter told us it would be a 20-25min wait. The thing I found most peculiar though was that there were clearly at least 2 other tables that would seat two available in the dining room. When we asked about this, we were told there were people ahead of us waiting for a table. That makes sense, but I could see the other parties of two weren't being seated either. After waiting for half an hour we were about to leave but a waiter called us back and asked us to wait a bit longer, offering a free appetizer for our patience. Eventually we were seated and I realized they were waiting to seat the party of 3 ahead of us at a bigger table. I'm still a little confused about the need to have us wait for them to be seated first because they had a larger group that wouldn't fit at one of the small tables. So although we arrived after them, I'm sure they would have understood that parties of 2 could be seated earlier. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here but generally I think it makes sense to seat based on capacity and not strictly order. Anyway, I ended up ordering the Chicken Korma and the quality was excellent. This and the free appetizer was enough to make me forget my prior displeasure concerning the long wait for being seated and getting food.",

The mango lassi is a bit overpowering on the yogurt I can't complain if it's their style since it was still pretty good. If you go in for buffet, I would definitely recommend this place. As for dinner, I have no clue yet.",

The directions can be a little unclear, but I have learned from experiance that 1. on weekends the only lunch options are the buffet- which you can't use the groupon for. 2. you need a reservation for dinner regardless of the day if you plan on using it. If you have the reservation you are good to go,  but if not it seems as though they will be hard to budge.  Otherwise great food, casual yet romantic atmosphere, and a great place to go if you've never had indian before!",

    "text": "Actual star rating 2.5   Background: Indian food is probably my favorite style of food, my wife and I have have been to India on a culinary trip and we have eaten in over 100 different Indian restaurants in the US over a 20 year period. So I am a little picky.   We started of with a Samosa - the pasty was light and flaky, very good, however the filling left much to be desired. I have never had a samosa that had shredded (think hash browns) potatoes inside of it. The traditional is a mashed potato and the hash browns were not very pleasant. However the tamarind and hari chutney were very good.   For entrees we had the Aloo Gobi Masala and the Chilly Chicken. The Masala dish was not inedible but was not a traditional masala or even one of the many variations that I have tasted. First of all it was very yellow because way too much turmeric was put into it. Secondly there was no underlying masala flavor or cumin that could be detected. It was just a bunch of turmeric, yogurt and garlic. It was edible but not what I would have called a Masala dish.   The Chilly Chicken was good but again not what I expected. This dish was more an Indonesian or Chinese style cooking and appeared to be flavored with Sambal Oelek. Like I said the dish was good, but not very Indian in nature.   The garlic naan needed help, the base naan itself was good, but tossing raw garlic that had been sitting in lemon juice or some other sort of acid was not good. Plus it appeared to have a small sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on it - strange. If one wishes to top it with something why not the more traditional chopped cilantro.   The mango Lassi was served with ice (usually only done when it's very hot) and the Masala chai was good.   After the failure at Udipi and now this rather under-par experience I am beginning to wonder if the burgh has any good Indian places to eat.",

    "text": "Hrm, I've never really enjoyed a meal at Tamarind. I've had the lunch buffet a couple of times (seemed like the same lame stuff both times) and have ordered dinner from the menu on several occasions. Nothing has ever seemed very fresh and I've not experienced any serious spice here. The tamarind sauce (which you'd think would be their specialty), in addition to all of their condiments, taste generic rather than scratch-made. The dinner entrees come with a side of veggies or dal, and I swear they just give you leftovers from the lunch buffet. For example, I got a side consisting of crusty looking peas and carrots with random stuff dropped in; a lentil and a piece of cauliflower stalk. The rice also seemed reminiscent of buffet recycling measures. I hate to think of food getting wasted, but I'd go dumpster diving before paying $11 for food that most restaurants would either throw away for fear of contamination, or at least freshen up to make their parsimony less obvious. My Baingan Bhartha, a totally mild \"10,\" was tasty enough, however it didn't have any peas in it (it's supposed to, even according to their menu). Best bet is probably to order dosas, because at least you can count on them being made to order.  I have witnessed some off service here, like this last time they basically seated a gal at the service station (a table pushed up against another table where they store and retrieve the silverware, water pitchers, napkins etc.), even though the restaurant was empty with the exception of me. The girl moved herself to a more desirable table.  I love the painting with the squirrel and tamarind pod.",

It looks so yummy, and I steal bites of his rice soaked in the sauce, and then I complain about how nobody offers vegetarian tikka masala.  Once I tried to make tofu tikka masala.  (It sucked.)  And then!  I heard about Tamarind.  And I looked at their menu online, like I always do.  And they had paneer tikka masala!  \"We're going here,\" I decided.  But I didn't even tell you the best part yet.  I almost don't want to, for fear that the next time I go it will be overrun and crowded and I'll have to wait for a table or they'll sell out of something good.  But I'll tell you.  On Sundays, they have a 2 for $25 deal.  An appetizer, two entrees, an order of naan, and two soft drinks.  For $25.  And their portions are huge and come with a side of mixed veggies or dal soup.  You really can't go wrong.  Their menu has both north and south Indian dishes so everyone can find something that sounds delicious.  I thought the atmosphere was really nice and the service was really attentive and fast, unlike previous reviews.  I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying more of the menu.",

That's a pity, because there are some good things here: It is a nice, bright room, the waiters are friendly, the nan bread was light and crispy, the portions are generous, the meat is good quality and the spicing has just the right amount of heat. Unfortunately, the sauces all seem to be very salty, the spices lack subtlety, the samosas were stodgy and the \"daal\" served with the chicken korma was more like dishwater.  It isn't bad by any means, but it isn't wonderful either.",

It turned out to be an excellent choice for our evening.  The location in a very old restored house with sweeping ceilings set a very relaxed tone to the meal. Most of the tables were enjoying conversations with dinner and not in any way rushed. Parking on the street was a breeze.   Our table of 5 ordered 5 entrees, samosas and naan. The palak paneer was the favorite of the table and the double order of garlic naan didn't last through the meal. The mutter paneer was especially flavorful. Nothing was as spicy as I was prepared to encounter which didn't bother me, but was a plus for the rest of the group. The service was prompt and accommodating when we decided to share all the entrees around the table.  Let me finish by recommending Tamarind for a good Indian meal in Pittsburgh with good company.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh, for its size, has a fair amount of Indian restaurants and I would suggest that this one is the best in town serving Northern Indian cuisine.   Tamarind does have a nice atmosphere and it is located in a restored older house that has been remodeled in such a way that it provides a comfortable and warm ambiance. The servers were attentive, knowledgeable, professional, and nice.   Entrees are moderately priced for comparable meals at other Indian restaurants in the area. Regular entrees include a good portion of the main curry with rice and either dal (it is yellow dal in a soupy form--very good) or mixed vegetables on the side. One great aspect of Tamarind's menu is that they have Northern and Southern Indian cuisine offered, which is not terribly common in this region of the US.  Once again, I am sorry that there is not a half-star rating on yelp because I think that Tamarind is really between 4 and 5 stars. Tamarind would be a great place to take out of towners, go out with friends, or even go on a first date.",

The restaurant is nestled in a cute house in Oakland and the inside has pretty decor. Our server was friendly and gave us many recommendations for what to try. For appetizers, my dad and I split the ethnic sampler which comes with fried hot chili peppers, samosas, and vegetable pakora. We also got the lentil patties. The fried hot chili peppers were amazing, because they had a tiny bit of heat to them! The samosas were flaky and crispy, and they weren't dry. The lentil patties were served with various sauces that each had a unique flavor to them.   For the main course, I had the lamb vindaloo which was so yummy. The vindaloo sauce was almost like a thick tomato sauce with some spice to it. It was a generous portion that came with vegetable daal and basmati rice. Also, the entree came with garlic naan, which definitely hit the spot. The naan was soft and chewy and had the perfect amount of garlic.   I want to come back to Tamarind, because everything was outstanding and satisfied my Indian food craving :) I would highly recommend.",

The samosas were very good, but they tasted as if they had been frozen. The paneer tikka masala was amazing. The sauce was so delicious to dip the Naan into. The channa masala was great too. The Chettinadu vegetables were not my favorite, but they were OK.   The service was great. Our waiter stayed on top of our water demand, and he was very nice and patient when we ordered.   This is not the best Indian food I have ever had, or close to it, but it's a great local find.

Last time I wrote a review, I stated I prefer All India, located on the same street. And I still do, but Tamarind does have a lower price point for fewer selections, which is fine, because the food is good.

The Kadai was delicious and wasn't too spicy at all! Although I still love my Tikka Masala more, the Kadai was still really good. I think the first time I had Indian food was at this restaurant and they definitely did not disappoint.  * Cost vs. Worth: Their entrees are about $13-$15 which is what to be expected in Pittsburgh. I know they have a lunch buffet around that price and is very much worth it.     Will I come here again? - Of course!!",

On Wednesdays they have student night so bring your student ID and get 50% off your second entree!   We got a serving of garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and one of the dosas. Everything came as a pretty sizable portion and was REALLY tasty and authentic. The prices are also really good for the amount of food they give you and for everything we got, it was only $40 total with a 20% tip. This is now my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant!",

It took 10 minutes for someone to notice us looking for a table, even after he walked past us and made eye contact with us.   There was no request for a few minutes extra, no acknowledgment, nothing. After waiting for a long time, he walked by and said \"5 minutes\". Okay, sure. Comes back, no words, and just points to a table - ok, i guess we'll go there. Wait 10 minutes to order, and actually, we're still waiting. By the time you read this, theres a chance we either leave before we order or we're still waiting.  If you plan on coming here, book 2x the amount of time needed...or just go to Choolah, atleast the food is worth it.",

Man, I wish Naan is free or cheaper but they're so good, I could not Not get them. And let me tell you about Saag. It's now my official favorite Indian food. I'm obsessed. I actually packed my little tiny bit of leftover sauce to go just so I can taste more of these the day after.  Our waiter was very attentive and helpful as well. I cannot have a better experience.

    "text": "We just returned for a follow-up visit to Tamarind and a chance to use our Groupon (since we somehow forgot we had it the first time we went back in May).  It was crowded for a Sunday night, but that is my experience with Groupons in their last valid days: places get packed.  But Tamarind is deserving of the crowds.  This place serves legitimately awesome Indian food, served by a really friendly staff who knows how to take care of you, and educate you about your food as well, if you'd like.  One of the unique things about Tamarind is the inclusion of dosas on their menu.  We'd never had (or even heard about) dosas before coming here, but we have now tried two of them, and loved both!  The dosas are large, flat, crepe-like breads served with different sauces for dipping.  We tried the cilantro dosa first, which was seasoned but not stuffed, and last night tried the madras masala dosa, which was stuffed with potatoes, lentils, and onions.  Oh, it was so good (but I do recommend splitting it, as it was also huge!).  They also do your standard Indian dishes very well: we had samosas on our first visit, and they were exactly how samosas were intended to be, with a light, crispy outside and a hearty filling inside.  The naan is EXCELLENT, puffy and buttered and garlicky as can be (the garlic naan, that is, we haven't tried any other varieties because the garlic was so good).  Both times, my husband has gotten tandoori entrees.  He is a meat-eater, while I always prefer vegetarian Indian options.  Both the chicken tikka and the seekh kabab were served steaming hot and cooked to perfection.  I got the mattar paneer first, and the aloo gobi masala on our second visit.  At each meal, I felt so full, but couldn't hold back from eating more because the flavors were so good.  What I loved about the aloo gobi masala (potatoes and cauliflower) was the sensation that you were eating something really spicy, without the actual super-spiciness that leaves you sweating and gulping water.  I presume this must be an ancient Indian secret, but I am definitely content to keep coming back to try to figure out the mystery :)  Tamarind is BYOB, which is another nice touch.  It's $5 for a bottle of wine, and they will uncork it and bring you glasses while you peruse the menu.  Last night, it was extremely busy (they do take reservations though, so especially if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, this is your best bet), and somewhere in the shuffle our garlic naan got sent to the wrong table.  Our waitress noticed immediately that we were without bread, so she apologized, got the chef to toss together some fresh, too-hot-to-touch garlic naan in minutes, and actually took the item off the bill for us to make up for the delay!  See what I mean about awesome waitstaff?  I'm not sure that there is an actual parking lot, but there is ample street parking just nearby, and it's on bus lines as well.  Tamarind is set in a lovely old house, so you get the feeling that you've been invited to a friend's dining room for dinner, which I love.  Needless to say, we will definitely be back!  :)",

Portions are small (two incredibly small rasmali for $5?!) and flavor is OK- I would say I rather go to Udipi for classic food or Indian Garden for cheap flavor.   Not worth it in my opinion...",

I have, however, tried my friend's butter chicken. It was pretty darn good! It was nothing like the common creamy butter chicken that you see if EVERY north-Indian restaurant. This one had more of a chicken curry consistency, but it was oh-so-good! Their tandoori chicken that the same friend got another time, is a little blah. I wouldn't recommend that.

It was a hot evening, but fortunately we found pretty easy parking on Craig Street and didn't have to walk long before we reached the renovated house that is Tamarind.  We both loved the atmosphere immediately - it looks like somebody's home, with a few stained glass windows, staircases behind the kitchen, and tables by sunny windows.  We made a reservation (which you need, for the Groupon), and we were seated immediately.  There were quite a few other patrons dining in - definitely a popular place.  On Sundays they have a deal where for $25, two people can get an appetizers, two entrees, and a side of bread.  If you have the Groupon, you can't take advantage of this deal, but that's okay - you'll just have to come back another time (and trust me, you'll want to come back!)  We started with waters, and I got a mango lassi - Tamarind's version is sweet and refreshing, a perfect complement to the meal.  We skipped appetizers, knowing how full we get at Indian restaurants, and settled on Saag Paneer, Lamb Biryani, and a side of Onion Naan.  We were warned that the lamb biryani was spicy, and assured our server that we could handle it.  The naan came out first - very fresh and crispy.  The flavor was mild, not very onion-y but you could see the little flecks of charred onion dotted throughout the bread.  We both inhaled our first slices, stopping only to put spoonfuls of chutney on our plate for dipping (the green one is VERY potent with mint flavor).  The entrees were presented beautifully - I could not wait to devour them.  The saag paneer looked rich and succulent, with big heaps of cheese surrounded by vibrant spinach.  A small bowl of mild, soupy lentils accompanied the entree, as did plenty of basmati rice.  The lamb biryani arrived in a generous, heaping portion, and the smell of spices filled the table.  A cooling raita was served alongside.  We agreed that the saag paneer was one of the best versions of this classic dish that we've ever had.  It was creamy, luscious, and flavorful.  It was undoubtedly a cut above the rest in terms of quality and freshness.  The biryani was also excellent, though not nearly as spicy as advertised!  We were a little disappointed about that, and joked that if the server is warning us about spice, we expect to be perspiring and reaching for water!  The taste was wonderful, rich with cardamom, and the lamb was tender and flavorful.  All around, it was better than what we've had at most Indian restaurants.  These dishes that we've had dozens of times were raised to a new level by Tamarind.  It's not terribly expensive either, very reasonable prices considering the large portions and lovely atmosphere.  Even though Coriander is down the street from our apartment, we both agreed it would be worth the drive to go to Tamarind next time we have a craving for Indian food!",

Although not advertised as a spicy dish, it had plenty of kick to it (a perfect amount for me), so be careful ordering something hotter. I also had one of their samosas, which were also good.  Service was fine as well, the waiter gave some good recommendations on what to order.",

    "text": "The best Indian food I've ever had hands down, and I've had it all around the world at varying price ranges.  The restaurant itself is located in an old mansion, yet the atmosphere is a little lacking as it's on the dark side and lacking in unifying decor.  But the food more than makes up for it and the service is superb; a very friendly, accommodating and helpful staff whom are present just enough to fulfill all needs yet not be intrusive.  My husband and I couldn't decide (or agree!) on an appetizer, as they all looked so good, so we ordered the Ethnic Sampler which gave us a fairly substantial taste of the samosa (fried pastry with spicy vegetable filling), vegetable cutlet (deep fried vegetable patties) and mirchi bajji (deep friend chilies stuffed with chutney), enough for two diners so if there are more people in your party you'll want to order more than one.  My husband preferred the samosas and I the mirchi bajji, but we agreed that all were excellent so it's really a matter of personal taste.  We usually order our entrees with naan, any of them are good but my favorite is the garlic naan, which is not too greasy but still soft and fragrant and not at all dry.  In the past, we have also ordered the aloo paratha, which I considered a bit less flavorful and more dry than the naan--again, probably personal taste and having to do with the fact that it's made with potatoes.   The entrees themselves are excellent and so far I haven't had one I haven't liked, but there are two that stand above all the others.  Oddly enough my favorite is a rice dish, Chicken Biryani, which is not necessarily an entree though I order it as one.  The seasoning and spices used are amazing--very unique--it's very spicy with big chunks of high quality, lean chicken and it comes with a mellow yogurt sauce that helps tone down some of the heat.  My second favorite is the Chicken Pepper Fry, again, very spicy with a complex taste and loads of black pepper.  The one thing Tamarind gets right over and over is spiciness!  I've also had the Chicken Vindaloo, Curry and Aloo Gobi Masala, all very good.    I've always been too full to order dessert so I can't help you out there, though the mango lassi's are wonderful and refreshing.  I always finish mine up with the appetizer and wish I had more later on.  Also of note, there's a Dinner for Two Sunday night special that is a phenomenal deal; $25 gets you an appetizer, a bread and two entrees, which is more than enough for two diners.  There are only a few restrictions which are listed clearly in the menu.  Tuesday night is Dosa Night, order one get the second 50% off, and Wednesday night is Student Night, order one entree get the second 50% off, with appropriate student ID.",

This is what overwhelmed me when I was travelling there. Also, everything food-related in India is fresh and ten times more flavourful than in the US. That's why I love this restaurant.  I have tried it all at Tamarind and I am sure the other reviewers will help with their suggestions. Everything is fantastic.  I am just going to mention here my newest favourite: okra kadhai.",

My friend had some type of lamb sausage which were on skewers.  The spices were surprisingly subtle but still absolutely delicious with a warm vinaigrette on the side.  The service was by no means terrible but having waited tables myself I know it could have been slightly better.  Overall we enjoyed everything and the food was incredible.  I will definitely be back to try their weekend brunch of which I've heard amazing reviews.",

In summary, this was really very good Indian food, definitely exceeded our expectations for Pittsburgh.  Appetizers were Samosas and chicken with Manchurian sauce.  The samosas were tasty, well cooked and served with a very nice plum  sauce.  The chicken dish was delicious!  Coated, fried chicken pieces topped with a fantastically hot and spicy sauce.  Highly recommended and we would order again.  Main course was chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and shrimp korma.  The best of the three was the mutter paneer, peas and paneer in a creamy sauce.  Next best, the chicken masala had a great sauce, but the chicken was a little overcooked and a tad tough.  Bringing up the rear was the shrimp dish, again sauce was good but the shrimp got lost in the dish.   We also ordered the bread basket, a mix of different types of Naan and Roti.  Greta deal, and the bread was delicious,  Will we come back?  Without a doubt.",

I don't have a refined Indian food palate - so I usually stick to the safe stuff.  BUT I will tell you the Chicken tika masala was one of the best that I've ever had.    Plates were licked clean, the sauce was so amazing!  The Vindaloo was also great, we ordered it super spicy and it delivered.  Saag Paneer was better than most places as well - very rich and delicious.  I really enjoyed that this was in an old house converted to a restaurant.  Many of the Indian places in pittsburgh don't pay much attention to ambiance or setting.  Tamarind gives it a little more attention.  (apologies if I've butchered the spelling of any Indian dishes!)",

As a former Indian Garden addict, I really liked the focus on more vegetarian friendly dishes on the buffet instead of the normal chicken tikka masala and such. I can't remember for the life of me what the names of anything I had was, but I can tell you that it was yummy and worth it. Get there early or later if you don't want to sit in a loud and cramped room. Will be back during dinner hours so I can order from the menu!",

Staff were concerned when I asked for the vindaloo to be prepared extra spicy, but after a little well-intentioned debate she acquiesced to my request. I was incredibly satisfied. The flavors and spiciness were in perfect balance. Few of the Indian restaurants I have frequented are bold enough to meet my capsaicin requests. However, I am confident that anyone even after a little finagling could find the perfect balance of spice to suite their palate.  The staff do seem to be a tad confused however. The garlic naan I ordered, which I had asked to be served as an appetizer appeared after my vindaloo, and only after I had asked about it. The food served to my friends had already arrived. Nonetheless, if the communication among the staff were improved, this would be a 5-star establishment!",

    "text": "Normally I get takeout, but a friend and I stopped in for the lunch buffet right on a Saturday afternoon. The buffet is predominantly South Indian, which means you may not find the dishes that are typical in American Indian restaurants, which mostly come from the North. So (for example) there was no butter chicken, but there WAS a very lovely spicy Andhra-style chicken curry where the chicken was super-tender as it was still on the bone. It reminded me quite a bit of the chicken curries I ate in India. We also had the curd rice (delicious, like a savory rice pudding with mustard seeds and curry leaves), and a number of Northern-style vegetable curries--saag aloo and cauliflower in cashew sauce were particulary good. And you get free dosas! The buffet is (imo, as a Westerner who has been to India but doesn't claim any expertise in Indian cuisine) very authentic to the consistency and spice of what you might get in India, but people who are used to more Americanized food may find it unfamiliar.  I usually get chicken 65, vegetable Chettinad, and samosas for takeout--the samosas are huge and always crispy. It's a draw between this place and Udipi for me in terms of South Indian in Pittsburgh--Tamarind is much closer but Udipi has upma. But you can't do better in terms of buffet, and lunch is dirt-cheap.",

We ordered a bunch of dishes, including the samosas, the madras masala dosa, and the navratan korma.  The samosas were really great and came with three little dipping sauces.  The madras masala dosa was tasty - a huge Indian crepe rolled up with yummy potato and onion inside.  The navratan korma was the highlight, with yummy veggies in a creamy tomato sauce with raisins and nuts and other fruits in it.  Yum!  The atmosphere is bright and cheery.  The service was a little crusty, but we didn't mind too much.  I hear they have a great lunch buffet, and they also offer deals on different weeknights, like a $25 dinner for two on Sundays, and Dosa Nights on Tuesdays.

I tried my friend's Tandoori chicken, and that was disappointingly dry, which was weird because my chicken basically fell apart when I poked at it with my fork.   For some weird reason, the music that was playing seemed like a mix-tape of someone who was tripping pretty hard on acid while doing hot yoga. Not too keen on that, but, you know, don't sweat the small stuff. The rest of the place seemed pretty cool.   My friend asked about the private rooms upstairs, and the waitress said that it seats 40 people, if anybody is interested in that.   Portions are pretty decent, but definitely a little expensive for a poor college student like myself.

On Valentine's Day, the kitchen made a mistake on our takeout and gave us one order of Tikka Masala instead of 2. Now, we were looking for a romantic dinner, but sharing one order isn't exactly what we had in mind. That time, the Tikka Masala was really good, but since then, we've had takeout in which the chicken was almost spongey. I found it completely inedible.   I think we'll give it another chance or two because it is close and has been delicious in the past, but if we don't and I never end up eating there again, I'll really be OK.   And a $5 corkage fee?

    "text": "My husband and I had been wanting to try Tamarind for years - literally! - and were so excited to finally check out the restaurant on Sunday. Service was quick from being seated to bringing the check. Lunch buffet was our only option, and it was a great introduction to the restaurant. I enjoyed all the dishes that I tried. My husband would normally order his food with an above average spice level while I would order a spice level 1 or 2, so I was very pleased that Tamarind's buffet pleased us both. We were both shocked when the bill arrived... I believe the total was about $20? We'll definitely be back soon!!",

    "text": "I was here with some friends a couple of weeks ago. I found the place to be very dirty, and somewhat disorganized. We were made to sit right next to the door leading to the kitchen and the restrooms. It was very busy, loud and disturbing area, with too many people moving around. There were flies around where we were sitting, and one of them walked all over my cup, and fell in the cup of my friend. Then, they brought a new cup of water, but with no ice. When I asked for them to add some ice to it, they basically filled it up with ice, with barely any water left. After they took the order, it took them almost half hour to bring the order out. They didn't bring everything together. One of my friends, who ordered or a paper dosa, had to wait another 10 min or so, and it was served cold. Since they are understaffed, there were no waiters to check on us to see if we needed water, or anything else, or whether the food tasted fine.  The dosas were ok. Nothing to make them stand out. Also, the curry (masala) was served on the side at an extra price....to me that's penny pinching. I look for an authentic experience when going to Indian places, and this was far from one. And the filth, and flies, and level of service made the whole experience an utter disappointment.   I would give them 0 stars, if not for the system expecting me to give them one star.",

    "text": "Great casual neighborhood Indian restaurant. I've come here semi-regularly over the past few months and have never left unsatisfied.   First the place- the restaurant is in a Victorian style house, and is warmly decorated with nice paintings on the wall. It is nothing fancy, very casual, but it feels very welcoming. Easy to have a long relaxed lunch or dinner here.  The food - solid Indian food. No bells or whistles, just solid cooking. The food feels like authentic home cooking. Very reasonably priced. The chicken tikka masala is always good, and I have a soft spot in my heart for their vegetarian dishes with okra and eggplant.  The service - very friendly! Prompt and courteous.  Tip- Come by for the lunch buffet! For just $9.23 (incl tax) on weekdays and around $11 on weekends. It's all you can eat, (including mango lassi! *drool*) and has a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Good option for serving larger groups too.",

It seemed like a small place, but the snowy weather probably kept it from being too crowded. Service was very good, they even bring roti to the table.  I noticed the veggie dishes are kept at a separate station from meat dishes. I tried a little of each vegan dish, and really liked them all. They do have mango lassi on the buffet, which is pretty cool and I haven't seen elsewhere. I still think Coriander has them beat in quality, but it was a great deal ($8.99 on a Sunday) and I would gladly come back!",

This is not chai tea. It was the right color. However the smell was off. After taking my first sip I discovered it was bitter with a strong lemony hint.",

I never understood why Indian restaurants feel the need to play music videos on a TV while people want to spend time being together and looking at each other's face and NOT A TV. If you want to watch a TV while having food, you order take out! Isn't that obvious?? So, it gives you a good dining out vibe that most Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh do not. 2) I love the dining area. It is bright and it feels spacious enough. Again, most of the Indian buffets in Pittsburgh have dark dining rooms with small windows and little light.  And the food: Always consistent and tasty. I love all their vegetarian items. I just feel like their chicken tikka masala could have a more solid sauce, it is too watery for my liking and compared to what I have seen in other Indian restaurant. Otherwise, will definitely return while still in Pittsburgh!",
