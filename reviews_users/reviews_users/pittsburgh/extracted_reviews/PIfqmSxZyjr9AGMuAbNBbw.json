The entrees seem to be a bit overpriced - probably due to lack of competition.",

It could definitely be personal preference, because the flavor of the food is spot-on, but the curries were very thin, which detracted from the meal for me. The tea is good, but not great (although, again, it could be that I got used to a more sugary version in the South). Most of all, the portion sizes are small, but the prices are not. The people we spoke with were very nice, and got everything together very quickly, but we'll probably try to find another Thai place in the future.",

Their vegetables are fresh and generously portioned.  Their service is great if you eat in, too.  The mango and avocado curry are both really tasty.  Some of their dishes do tend to run on the spicy side, (and I say this as a person who likes spicy food!) so you might want to order them a little lower on the scale if you don't love spicy food.",

The appetizers I ordered were just ok. Only stand out was the tofu triangles. Very tasty with a great sauce. The same sauce in different variations was served with spring rolls and wings. Neither of which were notable. Had the crazy noodles with beef, spicy... excellent! Could eat this every day. Mango with coconut rice, very yummy. Overall, I think they are trying to incorporate Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai in the menu and failing. There are wonderful restaurants within a stones throw that deliver better renditions. Stick to Thai. I can only assume that the EXCELLENT reviews here are from individuals who have never had real Thai food before. If u r looking for a decent meal with good delivery service, this is your place, if you are looking for great Thai food..lb look elsewhere.",

We had been ordering delivery there weekly when we first moved into the area (over a year), but had one terrible experience with delivery that I haven't gone back in months. The driver took 2 hours to bring our food (needless to say it was cold when it arrived) and upon his arrival he told us that we couldn't order delivery there anymore as we were outside of their service area. We are less than 5 miles away from their location, so this was pretty hard to believe. Between the 2 hour wait and the rudeness of the driver, (not to mention they were keeping some delicious Crazy Noodles away from a 9-month pregnant woman) it will take some time before we order there again.",

I have enjoyed Thai food locally at Nicki's Thai Kitchen, Thai Me Up, Bangkok Balcony and Silk Elephant, and Sawasdee Thai is tied for my favorite! Nicki's is my favorite for atmosphere, hello super cool back yard seating, and the food is great too. Thai Me Up probably has my single favorite dish. But the Country Pad Thai (a spicy version of Pad Thai) at Sawasdee is my very favorite Pad Thai around town. It's always done perfectly, and it's always delicious! The Crazy Noodle and Pad See You are both delicious as well. I love noodle dishes, and theirs are delicious!!!   Their Tom Kha soup is AMAZING! I always get it spicy, and it's so very good. The ginger salad is eh, not worth it. The Tempura Appetizer is good if you are craving fried food, as its light and crispy, yet hits the spot for fried goodness. They have a pretty extensive menu, and I haven't even tried much more than their noodle dishes, soups, and appetizers.   They do have a few tables to eat in at the restaurant, but the atmosphere there is certainly nothing to write home about. You're usually the only occupied table in the restaurant which can be odd. BUT they deliver, which has been delicious for my tummy, but bad for my pocketbook...   Finally, good Thai in the South Hills!",

It's a bit pricey but worth it as the taste is superb.  Grown ups had Country Pad Thai with shrimp and Green curry; 10 year old had Indonesian fried rice.   All delicious with plenty left over for several meals.  Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Was craving Thai food after seeing a google doodle about pad Thai, so a group of us found Sawasdee and made a stop in. Didn't realize it was mainly delivery/takeout, but luckily we were able to claim the single table they had inside! Two people appeared to be working tonight, with one running deliveries & pickups and the other doing the register, cooking, and pickups. While they seemed plenty busy, both employees were very friendly and welcoming, with the woman apologizing for wrapping our stuff up to go before realizing we were dining in (no big deal).   The food itself was decent - between the three of us we got pad thai w/ chicken, pad see-ew w/ chicken, and drunken noodles with tofu. The food came out pretty quickly and piping hot. The chicken was kind of dry and bland, but the noodles and vegetables were fine. The drunken noodles also got a thumbs up. 1-10 heat scale customization for each dish as well so you can get any item to your taste! This may not be our first pick for Thai food, especially if we are closer to some of the other good Thai places in the South Hills, but it's quick and friendly, and we'll definitely make another stop sometime to try out more items.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try Sawasdee based on the good reviews; I'm always on the lookout for good Thai restaurants in the south hills. I decided to order the country pad Thai for takeout, as it was advertised to be more authentic and spicy. Unfortunately, it tasted like regular pad Thai to me. In fact, I couldn't taste any spice at all in the dish and neither was I given a choice of spice level. Honestly, it just tasted like sweet and sour rice noodles. Although I didn't enjoy the pad Thai, delivery was relatively quick. Perhaps my lackluster experience was an isolated incident. If ever my Thai craving strikes and I don't feel like leaving the house, I may consider ordering something else from the menu for takeout again.",

We have found ourselves waiting for our order to be ready at pick up (which has been frustrating), but more times then not, the order is ready & waiting. Be sure to tell them your spice level - they don't always ask. Being a spice wimp, if you forget, I find it too spicy. But if you speak up, you will be accomodated. Favorites: Pad See-Ew tofu & veggie spring rolls. BTW, there's no room for eating... it's take out only! Sawasdee rarely disappoints!",

    "text": "This was my first time ordering from this restaurant, located across from Trader Joe's in Mt. Lebanon.  I ordered satay chicken, vegetable spring rolls, and chicken pad see-ew.     The quoted me a 30 minute deliver time, but it was 15 minutes.  Everything was extremely hot and obviously just cooked.    Chicken satay: this was an odd greenish color. It came with peanut sauce, which was cold and solid in the little cup. It also had a watery cucumber sauce that was very fresh tasting.  I liked both sauces, but the chicken was a bit strange.   Vegetable spring rolls: standard spring rolls. They were pretty decent, and they give you 5 of them for 4.95. They came with a sweet and sour sauce. I liked them and would order them again.   Pad see-ew: this was a mix of chewy wide noodles, cabbage, overcooked brownish broccoli, carrots, and egg.  I liked the taste of this dish, but it was slightly bland. I'd get it spicier next time (I ordered mild). I melted the peanut sauce from the satay and put it on this dish and it was really good.   Portion sizes: I don't understand people saying they were small portions. My container of pad see-ew was packed full and enough for 3 meals.  5 spring rolls for 4.95, and 4 skewers of chicken.  I got 2 cans of pop and my total, including tax was 26.74.  Pretty good value for the amount of food I got.   Overall, I'd for sure order from here again.",

    "text": "Sawasdee Thai Kitchen was an outstanding surprise while spending three days at the Crowne Plaza Pittsburgh South. Fortunately we found this gem of a restaurant the first day. The summer rolls come as you would expect - a roll - as opposed to the sushi roll presentation shown on their website. They were excellent. Fresh and crispy contents with a perfectly done wrap. We ordered the Hot Basil with Chicken and the Country Pad Thai with Chicken. Both were truly outstanding. Everything was properly cooked, hotness was spot on for the American palate, and the portion sizes were more than ample. Definitely good value for money. We ate leftovers for lunch the second day and plan to finish things off before hitting the road on day three, tomorrow.  Previous reviews have cited limited inside seating. When we were there there was none.  For context my sister-in-law is first generation Thai. She came to the US as a young adult. Family gatherings include a LOT of cooking and I have become SIL's sous. I think I can say with confidence that I know whereof I speak regarding Thai food.   We only get to Pittsburgh once or twice a year. Sawasdee Thai Kitchen will be on our \"must do\" list when we are here.",

Important note:  There is pad thai and country pad thai on the menu here - the country pad thai has a little spice, while the regular is the mild Americanized version.
