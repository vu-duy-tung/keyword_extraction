    "text": "Ugh.  Dear Franktuary,  Please stop attempting to make brunch.  Your selection is pathetically small and overpriced.  You pile on your subpar fries to make up for actual brunch foods.  You refuse to put cheese on scrambled eggs (cheddar is on the menu, so I know you have it!), with a pretentious, \"Noo, we don't do that.....\"  Whatever that means.  And your veggie sausage is REPUGNANT.  Sausage is not supposed to crumble apart, regardless of what it's made from.  Please stick to making hot dogs.  Bottom line: my husband and I left your restaurant feeling very hungry.  That sucks.    Also, let's agree to start using Heinz ketchup.  Whatever recipe you have is NOT cutting it.  I advise anyone going here to bring their own bottle.",

Here's what I don't like about Franktuary: The prices.  I understand keeping everything local increases the price, but 60 bucks for 4 hots dogs and 4 drinks?  Ehhhhh.....that's too much, and this was with a Happy Hour discount on 2 of the drinks.  The hot dogs are tasty, and the drinks are delicious and refreshing, just a little too pricey overall.  I'll be back for Tuesday Trivia Night; my recommendation is to stick to beer here and maybe only have one hot dog and/or one cocktail for a more reasonably priced evening.  I do LOVE the Church Wine - at 6 bucks a glass, it's a splurge, though!",

    "text": "I was insulted yesterday afternoon.   I wanted to see how Franktuary Lawrenceville handled meatballs.   Judging by their desiccant composition, I can only hypothesize that someone omitted the egg and bread crumbs.   Unsure of which type of bun to choose, and being that I'm unmoved by whole wheat bread, I went for a gluten-free roll and found it to be as arid as those pitiful meatballs, crumbling in my hands, so much so that I ate the meat with plastic utensils and tossed the bread in the trash.   Customizing my sorry sandwich further, I opted to have it topped with marinara and cheese curds. The marinara, which drowned the meatballs, almost made it worthwhile with its tanginess, but the cheese curds were evocative of flavorless chewing gum wads.   However, the pierogi trio I ordered were deep fried dumplings of oily, starchy adoration. Resembling crisped wontons stuffed with the manner of fluffy mashed potatoes that come from heaven, I was sad that I didn't order a sextet and eschew the moribund meatball sandwich.   Something that also truly chafes me about this Lawrenceville Franktuary is the idea of bohemians eating ridiculously expensive hot dogs with their smallest digits unfurled, and were they ever packing the joint when I visited for what will be the last time. About 5 neo-beatniks in \"vintage\" garb who are probably living off of trust funds and who were dying to people-watch and be watched themselves were disappointed by my presence, turning their heads to see WHO was walking in only to find me, a reg'lar old prole. They frowned and went back to their conversation. The service this trip was equally unenthusiastic. The bartender who took my order was more interested in chatting up other customers (namely flirting with older, upper-crust married men in suits and ties) to make even the slightest conversation with me.   Moreover, for nearly $19 dollars (including a $3 bottle of Boylan soda), I feel I should have enjoyed what I ate much more than I did, particularly when the organic, local-first ingredients are taken into account.  If Franktuary wants to \"redeem fast food,\" to paraphrase their motto, their pompous work is in vain. What they are doing is spitting in their patron's faces, and what's tragic is that their haughty clientele doesn't get it. Thankfully, the other side of Lawrenceville does.   Walk a few blocks down Butler Street, and you'll find a humble establishment in a humble building called Frankie's that makes moist, rich, and overall larger and superior meatballs with free fixings, not to mention kielbasa, hot sausage, and foot-long franks. If you're lunching alone, you won't spend more than $10, and if you are a genuine aficionado of good food and not aesthetic and trends, you'll relish it.   The Franktuary of Lawrenceville is not the Franktuary of Downtown Pittsburgh that shined a light onto my day a couple of years ago.  P.S. Take a look at the Franktuary website and notice that each location has its own distinct logo. The Downtown shoppe's logo is whimsical while the Lawrenceville location is stark and self-serious. Gimme some sanctuary from Franktuary...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRWiEvhgDdCw&s=4ce82873ad0fc04c6261d7ea9f38bc6254c35d6910fffe380162f41cb41162fd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=RWiE...</a>",

In short, it's awesome. A surprisingly large and tastefully decorated space with high ceilings, church pew seating, and a full bar!  This place is all about local. They have local breweries such as East End Brewing Company on tap, as well as cider from Arsenal Cider House. Soon, they will be featuring drinks made with whiskey from the local Wigle Whiskey.  Food-wise, In addition to somewhat standard hot dogs, they have some amazingly creative options such as the fishfurter. Yes, you read that right, a frank made from fish. Toppings for your hotdog range from traditional to Mexican to Japanese complete with wasabi mayo. Not feeling like hotdog? How about a salad with (optionally) a hotdog chopped up on top of it? If you're vegetarian, they even have a tofu hotdog. French fries are referred to as \"boring fries\" since the non-boring fries are made out of garbanzo beans (surprisingly good). You certainly won't be bored with the menu.",

Went during happy hour and the vibe I guess was chill enough but people were kind of crowding the entrance to the bar area when there were at least 6 booths with no one in them. So I kind of awkwardly stand around because I'm not sure if I go to the bar for food or if I sat down someone would serve me. I sat down and realized no one was serving me so I go to the bar and I ask about the specials. I get the special cocktail and it was good but not my style and I order food. Thirty minutes go by and no food, guy behind the bar says that I didn't order food and then he's all \"oh yea I'm so sorry...on the house\". By this point I was all nah I'm over it\". I did get another drink that was tasty but not worth it...Moscow mule with cranberries...but they forgot the cranberries. This was a bust.",

My 3 star rating is likely to change as we try the place several more times in the near future. It doesn't get a 5 star rating at this time because of one of the dogs we had, which we felt could certainly be improved on. (The japanese dog, in our opinion, could use some tweaking, since the seaweed, which sounds like such a great idea, was fairly bland and the texture just wasn't right for it to be served with a dog. )  Our waitress was new at the job, but was very friendly, and the service was excellent - fast, efficient, and courteous. The food was served at the right temperature, and was flavorful (we had the New Yorker, Athens, Texan and Negishi, plus a side of poutine and the fountain cola). The price was a little high for hot-dogs, but one can look past that for the level of quality and craft that went into setting up the place.  The bar looks inviting, and I am sure we'll be back to try out their craft in this area as well. What a great addition to the neighborhood!",

    "text": "Franktuary is good, slightly overpriced hot dogs.  The environment and the bar are really the stars.  I got the Bangkok Underdog.  It was a tasty dog with just a bit of spice.  The Thai peanut sauce really went well with the hot dog.  I could have eaten more than one of these for sure.  It was about $6.    My husband got two hot dogs, the Texan and the Southern Belle and was pleased with both of them.    The big problem we had was the poutine.  We love poutine.  We seek it out.  When we saw the Poutine Quebecoise on the menu, with cheese curds and brown gravy, we knew we had to order it.    Problem is, it's a brown gravy made of mushrooms and I don't know this for sure (their menu is extremely uninformative), but I think the cheese curds were some vegetarian invention.    I don't have a problem with vegan or vegetarian food.  Even though I am undeniably Team Meat, sometimes I even enjoy it.  I do not, however, like to be surprised by meatless dishes that traditionally are filled with meat and dairy deliciousness.  We asked the waiter, what is up with this gravy?  He said \"it's mushroom gravy, I know, it tastes a little weird.\"  The poutine was OK, but I don't like mushrooms to begin with, so there's no chance I\"m scarfing down a plate of mushroom gravy.  If there would have been any note on the menu of what was in this poutine, we would not have ordered it and instead tried a different version.    Shame on you Franktuary!  Bottom line:  Go for happy hour, enjoy the stunning bar and the fantastic drink and beer selection.  Get a dog but don't expect to make it a meal unless you want to drop cash.",

    "text": "We have been here before a few times, and always enjoyed both the atmosphere and the food. Even my super picky mom loves the hot dogs. Recently, we have started attending trivia nights on Tuesday, and it is so much fun!!! We get a reservation and are seated promptly by the smiling hostess. The waitresses are great, very friendly and fun, joking with us and completing their tasks quickly and efficiently.   They have an interesting list of cocktails as well as a varied beer list. Last week I started out with the Chabang Chabang, a gin drink with lemon and soda that was particularly refreshing on a hot summer day. Because of my food allergies I tend to shy away from the hot dogs (I am not a big fan of veggie dogs, and usually gluten free buns, which they do offer, have eggs in them). I do, however absolutely LOVE the garbanzo bean fries! Basically, they are just garbanzo beans ground up, baked, and then fried to perfection. They are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I follow it up with the vegan chili, which is surprisingly spicy and full of beans, peppers, and tofu. My husband does enjoy a good hot dog, and loves the Pittsburgh, which is covered in pierogies. We once split the kale salad, and it was also delicious, with roasted veggies and a light vinaigrette. When we are deep into trivia and need more sustenance we order a basket of homemade chips, which are thinner than I prefer but still a tasty snack to keep us going.   I usually end the night with a cider that they have on draft from Arsenal cider. I've also had the Church Punch, which is a fun twist on the punch I grew up drinking at various church events.    Trivia is fast-paced and competitive, but always a great time. The host is inventive and smart, a great combo for the crowd in Franktuary. We hope to continue coming back for a long time.",

The restaurant was decently packed and has a garage door which helps create a comfortable and pleasant vibe. I read the yelp reviews before entering, so I had pretty high expectations. Sadly, I was presented with an 'eh' meal.  I saw our entrees lying on the counter for about 10 minutes and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. After waiting for about 30 minutes, our meals were finally brought to our table. Honestly, the hot dogs were decent, but did not reach my expectations. They tasted alright, but were not exceptional. They were small as well, so I left the restaurant feeling hungry and unsatisfied.   The atmosphere was wonderful, but we waited for 30 minutes for food that I was very unimpressed with. Thus, I give this restaurant a rating of 3 out of 5 stars.",

They have a bunch of great themed nights like trivia, waffle, and a TV dinner night where they serve their twist on the old school microwave meal. The hotdogs are good and they also have a vegan dog which is a nice addition. They also have Poutine, which is delish. I know it used to be served with vegan gravy, but I'm not sure if that's the case still. I love their regular lunch/dinner menu! No complaints!   They also do brunch on the weekends with a changing menu each week. When I went, the service was really slow. Our waiter was pretty attentive, but it took at least a half hour to get our meals.   I got the Sweet Potato Poutine which was yummy and full of great flavors. The sweet potato hash browns were really overcooked though and way more crispy than I would have liked. The drizzle of coconut creme, sausage, cranberry sauce, and fried egg helped make up for the dry potato, but it would have been amazing if the potatoes weren't so overcooked. the brunch menu has a lot of amazing options (I had trouble picking! I wanted them all!), but the execution seems to be lacking a little.   I'd definitely go back again though to give the brunch another shot since the menu changes every weekend.

When the Dogma hit the fan and the name changed, I happily kneeled to Franktuary instead.  So, when word came that the one and only sanctuary of franks was opening in my 'hood, I was excited!  Unfortunately, I've been here thrice so far and have yet to love it.  The menu looks good in theory, but the food and service are average in my opinion.    Sure, $4ish for a dog is a bit on the high end, but if the ingredients make up for it, I'm fine with the price tag.  However, what I do think is a bit much is the fragment of romaine lettuce I received with my salmon fishfurter recently.  It wasn't even enough lettuce to roll up alongside the dog (if you're a weirdo who likes to wrap everything in lettuce like I do).  At 50 cents extra, it's not going to break the bank, I'm curious as to why I'm paying 50 more cents to forego the nice looking fresh bun for half a leaf of romaine - I just don't get it. My manfriend went for one of the poutines and was also pretty disappointed.  I say, stick to Kelly's for poutine, check out Franktuary downtown for a dog and stop by the L'Ville location for their bar.  Everybody wins.",

Being the Instagram food junkie that I am, I follow Franktuary and saw that on Friday, they serve a Fried Fish Sandwich! Having also just recently become Catholic, I was pummmppped for my first fish-initiation, and gathered up my fellow Catholics to head over for that sandwich I had been salivating over all day.   When we got there, it seemed busy, but luckily, they seated us right away! I was one step closer to my fish. It wasn't listed on the menu, but they had all of these topping \"styles\" that normally go on their normal menu items, like pierogies and all kinds of sauces that you could add to your sandwich.   I am a plain jane, so I just ordered my fish straight up on a bun, with a side of fries. My cohorts got a fish sandwich, grilled cheese style, which looked amazing, fried pierogies, and a fish sandwich on a lettuce boat with homemade chips and pickles.  Well. Mine was dry, again, maybe my fault for ordering it plain, but the flavor of the fish was also lacking for me. But that BUN DOE. It was to die for, I think potato bread, and I could have eaten a whole bucket of their homemade, skin-still-on French fries.   My friend loved her grilled cheese fish sandwich and both the pierogies & homemade chips were good (not as good as the fries though), but THOSE PICKLES. I wouldn't touch them, or sniff them, for that matter, with a ten foot pole. They tasted like straight vinegar and dirty socks.   And maybe the most disappointing factoid of the night was that they seemed to have taken a very serious stance on the Coke vs Pepsi issue and just decided to nix both altogether! When I asked which they had, the waitress kindly pointed to their hipster list of only $3 special, almost tastes like good pop you know and love, but not quite, pop. All 3 of us seriously considered whether that was a deal breaker for us or not to get up and walk out. I ordered the Boylan's Cola, and I am glad I did, because the acid from it was the only thing that drowned out the taste of those pickles.  The place was very cool looking, very church inspired, hence frank-TUARY, and I am definitely interested in going back.   Everyone who ordered the franks looked to be enjoying themselves, and the food looked great, but I would just caution against the fish sandwich, or maybe just add some really great style to cover up the flavor, or lack thereof.

Not only do they have some really great frank combinations, but they have so many options to appeal to everybody needs. The waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients that went into their food. I got the Texan and Buffalo franks, with no dairy which was perfect.  Their vegan ranch is to die for, as crazy as that sounds. The vegan ranch anywhere else is revolting, but I love the vegan ranch at Franktuary more than real ranch.",

I want to like Franktuary, but I just wasn't impressed. The service was great, the interior was nice, the drinks were good, and the meal was so underwhelming that I probably won't go back. Writing this review has made me realize that I am actually angry at Franktuary for not giving me the hot dog nirvana I've always wanted.",

    "text": "When I was in high school, I had a crush on a girl in my Calculus class. Every day she brought a freshly-clipped copy of the newspaper's crossword puzzle and would work on it while our teacher droned on about derivatives. To get noticed by her, I started bringing the crossword puzzle to class too. Soon, we started working on the puzzles together, passing the paper back and forth while writing notes to each other in the margins about our guesses for clues. Although she never developed any romantic feelings towards me, I did become extremely good at crossword puzzles.   Up until last week, that talent had mostly just sat on the shelf of my brain, only used to occupy time on boring airplane flights. However, last Thursday my sister and her boyfriend took me to Franktuary were I was finally able to put my skills to good use on their weekly Crossword Challenge.  Every Thursday (starting at 7 pm), Franktuary issues two crossword puzzles to every table. If you finish the easy crossword in 15 minutes or less, you get 20% off of your meal. 10% for finishing in 45 minutes. If you finish the hard puzzle at all, you get 30% off. You can even work as a team. No phones allowed though!  We totally dominated the easy puzzle in 14 minutes for the 20% discount. We barely finished a quarter of the hard puzzle though. At any rate, I had a ton of fun doing the puzzle and we saved $9 on our meal. Win-win.  Although the crossword puzzling is enough to get five stars from me, the food was actually very good too. I had the Chicago Imposter hot dog and all of the ingredients were really flavorful. I especially enjoyed the sweet relish. The fries I ordered with my hot dog were great too.   Overall, we were all pretty impressed with the food. The service was a little slow, but I like to think they were just giving us more time to work on the crossword. Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I will definitely return.",

Only complaint/only reason not to give 5 stars was that the food service was really spotty on trivia night. Food took forever to come, and waitress failed to bring mustard for corn dog (after I asked) for a long time; eventually had to walk up and get it myself. Casual, fun environment. When I have gluten-free or vegan friends visiting, I know where they can get cool food!",

Service was SO SLOW! 40 minutes for hotdogs and french fries?? Come on. Not to mention it was a weekday lunch, and I had to get back to work. Which I was late for by the way! Also, the music was odd and too loud!  The food was so, so. I liked that the fries are fresh cut, but they were overcooked and over salted. The hotdogs were skinny! Not what I expected for $4 each!

    "text": "Overall disappointed... pass on this place for brunch...though the concept was strong that's really the only thing that was. The frank was oily in a tough casing and was generally not appetizing. The unique delivery of the brunch frank topped with fried egg, cheese and bacon had real potential and frankly (pun not intended) were not a bad flavor combination if everything was not just average. The bun tasted store bought, which I'm sure most buns are but I was hoping for it  to be less obvious in the taste. I chose the salad over fries and was surprised to be served a large bed of leafy kale (which I guess could be nice if you like that sort of thing). A couple of my friends had the standard mimosa and were sorely disappointed. It was made with fresh squeezed orange juice which they said tasted \"off\". I will say that the service was strong and friendly but I'd be doing you a disservice to say that compensated for the flaws. I will however add that the variety of hotdogs and poutins was like something I had never seen and you get a decent amount of food for a decent price sooo if you're not as concerned about overall taste and just want somewhere \"cool\" for a frank and a beer well... maybe it's for you",

The sauce on top tied the delicious falafel balls in with the hot peppers scattered on top. Also, ordered a side of fries with garlic aioli. Hello! I could bath in that stuff. Definitely ask for extra, or at least a side of it when you order fries, no matter which kind. The entire party thoroughly enjoyed their meals, and we will be returning. Service was also excellent.

    "text": "As soon as I heard about Franktuary, I knew that it would be right up my alley since I love hot dogs. A trendy restaurant centered around this concept - what could be better?!  Franktuary has this hip vibe that is actually quite unique; a lot of the touches seem to have a gothic feel. I like that they really created their own distinctive atmosphere with their decor. I've been to Franktuary a couple times now, both for dinner and brunch. Most recently I came to the \"Souper Bowl Sunday\" brunch at Franktuary, which was seriously awesome!   I have to say that I actually think I like the brunch menu at Franktuary better than the dinner menu. A lot of the dinner franks are just a little too heavy for me since they're loaded with all different types of toppings and sauces; whenever I come for dinner I always end up asking for something on the side rather than on my dog. The brunch menu seems to be a little more toned down while still extremely unique and interesting! At my recent brunch, I ordered the \"Good Morning, Frank\" which is an all-beef frank topped with cheddar cheese and a fried egg. I absolutely loved it! The scallions on top added a nice touch, and the flavors were perfect together. I have never had an egg on a hot dog before, but man was it tasty. I also would like to mention that Franktuary has fantastic French fries - many restaurants just plop some floppy fries on the side of a plate for good measure, but Franktuary's fries are the perfect blend of crispy and soft. So good! I had a glass of Pittsburgh Nitro coffee with my brunch which seems like it would have been a strange mixture with a hot dog, but it was actually a perfect complement to my meal! Pittsburgh Nitro has the best nitro coffee around.  I do recommend checking out Franktuary if you have not been yet; the atmosphere and concept are cool, and the franks are quite delicious! Hopefully I will get a chance to try out the Market Square location sometime!",

Maybe 9:00 on a Saturday.  Looked like a nice crowd, but no wait.  Got good service and really enjoyed the food.  I got the Pittsburgh dog, (pierogie and slaw) and loved it.  Kind of a primanti's goes to Poland feel.  Vinegar slaw with red cabbage paired well.    Poutine (Quebecois) had a lot of pepper and thyme, but on a cold winter night it hit the spot.  From the bar, I got a \"Nuts for Fall\"...house alond bourbon, house cinnamon apple shrub, bourbon barrel aged maple syrup, Peychaud's.  It was good, but not great, and I was already mildly intoxicated.  I figured I'd quit while I was ahead and left half of it behind.  It was a nice departure from some of the haute cuisineries (yeah...I'm sticking with that) I've been frequenting lately, and proves you don't have to be fancy to be good.",

    "text": "Cozy establishment that still has some relics left behind from the church that once occupied this spot. We sat in a pew, which is about exactly as comfortable as it sounds. There was plenty of regular tables and bar seating for those not inclined to experience that weird bit of history.  Franktuary had an impressive beer selection that did not disappoint. Probably the best tasting 11% beer I've ever had was from Farmville, NC right next door to my old alma mater. They also had an extensive bottle selection and full bar.   The review is for the following hot dogs which I recommend you try: Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Bangkok. The Pittsburgh was garnished with two deep fried pierogis, the Chicago was missing the poppy seed bun and had a very strange pickle (not Vlasic) but was still good, and the Bangkok was different, but enjoyable. My biggest gripe with each is that the bun was not buttered and toasted and it was almost as if they had taken a bun right out of the bag and put it on the plate. A butter toasted bun can turn a mediocre hamburger or hot dog into a great and memorable one.   We also shared a plate of regular Quebec poutine between four people which was certainly enough to fill you up. The fries and gravy were quite good but the curds could have been melted or at least hot as they were not.  Four stars for the beer selection, three for the hot dogs and poutine. I think there is room for improvement with their food, but it was still tasty nonetheless. 3.5/5  Parking fills up fast so get there early, or walk.",

    "text": "I am not normally the biggest hot dog fan... At a summer picnic, I'm more likely to nibble on chips than chow down on a hot dog and bun. If you feel similarly, Franktuary could change your life!  I fell in love with the restaurant space and decor. It's a good, spacious size without feeling too large. My husband and I came here on Friday night, and the restaurant was busy but wait-free. The decor has a modern but homey and rustic feel. The lighting set the right mood, and I felt very comfortable here.   Let's discuss the food! My husband and I ordered standard hot dogs on potato buns. I had the PA Dutch (apple onion jam with cheddar)  and tried his Oahu (fabulous pineapple concoction - a special that night) and Bangkok (Thai peanut, carrot, and cilantro). The ingredients were very fresh and an excellent quality while the combinations were unique and delicious. We also split an order of the Poutine Philadelphie, also known as fries smothered in gravy, provolone, peppers, and onions. Though good, the gravy flavor became quite strong to me after several bites.   Overall, I was very impressed by the restaurant's design and food. I look forward to coming back here again and may even be upgrading my review to 5 stars when I do!",

    "text": "Franktuary - I have always wanted to like you. Truly. But...the feelings just aren't quite there.   My husband and I have lived in Lawrenceville for nearly 4 years. When Franktuary opened, we were excited to try it. We heard such rave reviews! However we were very underwhelmed with our first experience. Mediocre service and food, overpriced for what you got. It wasn't until this past year, when their food truck would be parked outside of Brew Gentleman and we would have an occasional Texan that we warmed up to the idea of trying them out again for dinner.   Last night we were to meet friends at Grapperia and we wanted to grab a quick bite close by. There was a wait at Round Corner Cantina, so we figured we'd give Franktuary another shot. Again, it was a disappointment. We were promptly greeted and seated by a friendly hostess who told us our server would be right with us. There were a fair amount of people there, but by no means was it busy. And we waited. And waited. After 15 minutes or so, my husband and I started having the discussion of how much longer we were willing to wait, when our server came to our table and apologized, saying there was a miscommunication. No issues with service from that point on, but our confidence was definitely wavering, as I had mentioned earlier that our service during our last visit wasn't the best.   I ordered the falafel, my husband ordered the Texan and a Pittsburgh and we shared an order of the Quebecois poutine. It was fine. Absolutely nothing remarkable. My husband makes better hot dogs and falafel. The poutine is pretty delicious, but after a few bites the saltiness of the gravy is a bit intense for my taste buds, requiring me to chug our carafe of water.   The bill plus tip came to $35. Which is not expensive, but for unsatisfying hot dogs and fries with gravy and a few cheese curds, it's also a disappointment.   Bottom line, my gut was right from the beginning.",

It was pretty crowded and the table next to use was extremely load and the staff did nothing about at all. Not my job to police the floor, but it was loud enough that I was pretty close.

When I heard they started serving brunch I thought hotdogs for breakfast why not! Just kidding and to my disappointment they did not even have the option to order a hot dog. The menu was very unique and had nice options to choose from however they were pricey. I went with the pick three option and you could choose from a variety of sides or small portions of most of the entrees. I went with the bacon which was fantastic, the parfait of the day which was not to my liking and beignets which were so so. The apple dipping sauce added some flavor to the beignets which were very bland. When I think of parfait I think sweet and this one had tons of chopped up red beets at the bottom which did not go well with the rest of the ingredients and the strong flavor took over. We went with a large party and our orders took a long time to be served. A few others in my party weren't thrilled with their meal and the portions were small. Stick with the hotdogs when going here.",

It's not, to the chagrin of other reviews, just a hotdog shop - in which case, I agree it would miss the mark - it should instead be viewed as a local restaurant that uses high-quality ingredients and happens to specialize in hotdogs. Don't expect to buy your 1 dollar hotdogs here people, you actually sit down in fun restaurant.  The awesome thing about the place is the wide selection of local foods and drinks. Cocktails are prepared well using great local products like Boyd and Blair vodka, Wigle whiskey, and Maggie's Farm rum.  They make made-to-order spritzers with a variety of combinations, which are great for the summer.  The food is superbly prepared. The meatballs are excellent and the fries well-prepared. Hotdogs were well-prepared with a variety of interesting and traditional toppings. In addition, our service was great. The waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is fun. Nothing to complain about whatsoever. Will definitely return and try some more things.",

Had a dog with chili on it, there was a lack of depth of flavor in the chili, needed more cumin or something. A bit of sweetness is fine with chili, but it was missing the hot and the spice.

I'm not a fan of soggy french fries --- I don't ever use ketchup and prefer fries crunchy, lightly salted and thats it.  But I did find the cheese curds yummy and my friends enjoyed the Poutine le Frank - we finished every sopping wet spud straw.  I would go back to try their Sunday brunch.  The beetballs, church wine punch, and pierogis were other menu items that caught my eye.  But I've reserved my pierogi binges on the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern happy hour on Fri/Sats and the popular underground monthly \"Pierogi Nights\" hosted by Apteka --- find on Facebook --- an amazing monthly meal --- I am looking forward to their future restaurant space.",

This place has pretty good food, including veggie-friendly items on their menu, and also generally good rotating taps and excellent mixology.  The major downside is the prices.  An evening out for two of us, even if we don't eat anything and just have a couple rounds of drinks, can run to $50 including tip.

Lets stay positive for the top part of the review, because I don't want to sound negative off of a single experience.    The hot dogs/sausages are fantastic.    They have choices that go beyond normal fare with grass fed beef, and locally sourced sausage, as well as topping beyond ketchup and mustard.     They also offer a variety of poutine (essentially fancy loaded french fries).   Their beer selection is also nice posting rotating craft beers and some consistent favorites.   The last time however I went we had a waiter who wrote nothing down, something that bothers me to begin with, and then proceeded to forget to bring things to our table and have to be asked multiple times OR brought incorrect things entirely.       I'll be honest and will likely try again because these are some good dogs in a fun atmosphere....hopefully I can add my star back.",

    "text": "So, I've been known to roll my eyes when anyone mentions Franktuary. See, I hate pretentious food. And I certainly don't need a pretentious hot dog. I mean, it's a damn hot dog, right?   BUT today I went to the L-ville location with some friends for brunch. And the brunch was pretty darn good. I had the Tres Tacos and my only complaint about the food was that my corn tortillas kept falling apart - but that is always my complaint with tacos on corn tortillas, so it's just the nature of the beast. All of our entrees came with a caprese salad which was a nice touch. The tacos were tasty, the tomatoes were heirloom and the coffee was decent. Our service was good.  I have one other small complaint, and this is really just me being whiney. I understand the theme of the place. It's called Franktuary, so there are churchy bits and whatnot. But I really, REALLY wish restaurants would stop using old church pews for seating. It is NOT comfortable. I suppose for young little hipsters who don't have back problems yet [the majority of their clientele], it's fine, but for old ladies like me...ugh. Seriously, those damn pews are the worst.  I'd previously only eaten their food from the Franktuary truck, and it's been a long time since I've done that, so I will definitely go back and give their pretentious hot dogs a shot before I truly pass judgment on them. Because, that's what JC would do.",

Franktuary is a larger place than some of the other eateries in Lawrenceville as it looks like they combined two store fronts. Plenty of seating. Very quaint place. The waitress was very nice and for a time was the only one waiting tables. How she kept up the pace was beyond me, She even took care of the bar patrons! Talk about hustle!! Anyhow I ordered a style my own hot dog with the grass fed beef, relish and onions and of course, bacon. Also ordered a smoked kielbasi. Had a side order of fries with cheese curds and gravy. The food arrived pretty quick. The hot dog had that snap when you bit into it. You could tell that it wasn't a eight pack hot dog from your local grocer. It was meaty. Very good. The kielbasi was also very meaty. Not your run of the mill kielbasi. Just the right seasoning  made for a great taste. The fries could have been crisper  as they were somewhat soggy but with the gravy and cheese curls, they offered a nice change from your regular french fries. I wish I could remember to take pictures. I shall return.",

If you find hot dog specific restaurants ridiculous, then I would still recommend Franktuary because it really hits the spot even if you think it's too pretentious or hipster or whatever. I've taken loads of friends here and never left disappointed although I have left ridiculously full (the poutine really packs a punch despite its deliciousness). I highly recommend the happy hour deal which includes $4 drafts, $1 off cocktails, and 1/2 off poutine and feature franks from 4-6 pm Tuesdays-Fridays. I've heard mixed reviews about Franktuary's brunch, but overall they do most things well. I'm gonna keep going until I conquer the whole menu!",

Service was friendly and fast! Beers made it to the table lickity-split & the food wasn't far behind. M & I both ordered tofu dogs. I ordered the Italian version & M ordered Pittsburgh style. Both were good, but M made the better choice. It came covered in cole slaw with fried piergies stuffed in between dog and bun.   We also ordered poutine (Canadian style), which was okay. I was delighted that it was vegetarian, I didn't care for the gravy. It was more grey than brown and too chunky to be right on poutine. It was salty and M liked it, so it must just be me.   Finally we ordered the veggie balls -- veggie meatballs served in marinara sauce. We got them without cheese and they were delicious! I plan on ordering them on my next trip.",

I got the Chicago Imposter Grass Fed Beef Frank and it was so yummy. Topped it off with the East End Big Hops IPA and it made for a great meal. My friend and I split the poutine and each got one hot dog and we left feeling comfortably full but not stuffed. Without an appetizer, definitely get 2+ hot dogs (so much variety that that shouldn't be any trouble!). Definitely a great place to go with a group if you're feeling like some yummy bar food.

    "text": "I found out about the Franktuary when we were planning our trip to the NCAA Hockey Frozen Four and was quite excited at the prospect of eating a good hot dog, something I have not really been able to do for the decade and a half that I have been a vegan. As you can see from my rating, I was not disappointed, nor was my omnivore spouse who enjoyed her conventional dog. We went twice, the second time ordering two dogs each since we observed that to be the norm during our first visit. We had lunch both times, so it was not busy and the service was very good.   1st Visit: I had the Chicago Imposter, boring fries (nothing on them) and pickles. My wife had the Texan and boring fries. The beer was also good. 2nd Visit: I had the NY & Bangkok dogs & fries with poutine Quebecoise (without the curds). My wife had another Texan and the Chicago, with boring fries and my cheese curds. We used to visit Montreal every year to see baseball and enjoy the excellent food and culture, so having poutine again also sounded interesting and it was.   We ate too much both times.   What I really liked were the fixings and presentation for the dogs. All of the ingredients were super. The only obvious area for improvement, and thus the 4 star rather than 5 star rating, is the tofu dog. A good tofu dog is as hard to find as a good vegan pizza with a cheese substitute. Only once in my life have I had either. I have had good fake sausages more often, but those are rare too. Someday someone will figure out how to make a good vegan hot dog ... I hope.",

The food was good but not amazing.  I like the idea of customizing your own hotdog with different regional styles.  I got the down under Pittsburgh dog.  My problem was with the size of the hot dog.  I was looking for something more substancial.  It wasn't filling at all.  We also got the poutine which was what you would expect from a 7 dollar poutine...good but nothing that blows you away.  Maybe we would go back as a novelty but not on a regular basis.  To spend that much for a hotdog I need to be blown away or at a pirates game.",

Never, ever going to Franktuary again after the experience we had with our waiter.  My mom's bacon came out barely cooked, so she sent it back to be cooked properly. Because there's an open kitchen, she then saw our waiter *pick the bacon up in his bare hands and put it back on her plate.* Seriously, what? No gloves, no handwashing. I don't know where this guy's hands have been - he could have touched any number of unwashed surfaces, foods, or body parts before that bacon. Grosser than gross.  I could have forgiven that (maybe, and with a write-off of the bacon) if the waiter hadn't been so nasty. Instead of apologizing, he got defensive: \"What, you think no one touches anything with their hands in the kitchen?!\" I'm not naive - sure people touch things when cooking. But at a restaurant, I expect people who handle food to wash their hands regularly, wear gloves, and use tongs whenever possible. Anyway, the waiter just got ruder and more obnoxious after that - to the point that he FOLLOWED US OUT TO THE STREET TO YELL AT US after we left him no tip (sorry, but he certainly did nothing to earn one).  Between the unsanitary food handling and the attitude, I won't be going back to Franktuary. I'm also filing a report with the County Health Department because I don't usually order e. coli with my meals.",

It was perfect for her because she's a vegetarian and they have all sorts of vegetarian options, but I was underwhelmed by the options given the prices. I ended up having some of the poutine (didn't even come close to the ones I've had in Montreal), the chickpea fries (which a lot of people say had the texture of chicken... definitely did not), and a salad with a sausage. The salad was measly and the sausage was good, but nothing special. My friends ordered actual hot dogs, which looked good and they enjoyed, but the prices were a bid high for what they were getting!  The cocktails were good and the beer selection was quite nice, so I'd say this may be a better place for a nighttime drink and munchies rather than dinner. The service was neither good nor bad.",

We had the \"Breakfast in Quebec Poutine\" and the \"Return of the Waffle Sandwich\" which were both okay. The poutine was just poutine with 2 fried eggs on it, not really sure why it even made a spot on the Brunch Menu. There was another option for Short Rib Poutine as well. The waffle sandwich that I had consisted of sausage patties, lettuce, tomato, maple aioli, and Belgian waffle. it was a little messy to eat, and to be honest, not that special, maybe it would have been nicer if there was an egg in it.

We weren't a fan of the chili. No reason really other than it tasted really average.   My choice of hot dog was the Omaha (sauerkraut, swiss cheese, thousand island). Boyfriend got the Oahu (bacon, pineapple, teriyaki, scallions) and the Koreatown (Korean BBQ, cheese, kimchi, cilantro). They were interesting! We both enjoyed our hot dogs and thought they were priced fairly reasonably too.   More positives about our experience: - Our server, Delaney, was super sweet.  - The restaurant plays great music. - Half off wine on Wednesdays after 6pm!

I was somewhat trying to watch what I was eating when I went so I did stay away from good old hot dog on a bun and fries.   I opted to go with a salad with bacon and avocado with a balsamic dressing and I added a good old snappy hot dog to the salad.  The dressing on that salad was Fantasic too!   Now when reading the menu I was thrown off with the side of garbanzo fries.  Yes I said garbonzo fries.  Now I love garbanzo beans but have never even heard of garbonzo fries.  SOOOO of course I had to try them.  I got them with the garlic dipping sauce and OMG!!!! The are a MUsT try.  So yes... you can't go wrong with a hotdog and fries but they have great alternatives so something different here too.  They only thing that sucks for someone driving in is parking.  But that's an issue anywhere you go in Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "This review is in response to a specific customer service episode. I have actually been a long-time (and fairly regular customer) of this restaurant because of their vegetarian offerings. I attempted to place an online order this evening and after two orders were spontaneously cancelled by the restaurant (1 because a requested item was unavailable and 1 with no explanation), I contacted them to confirm that they were accepting online orders. They confirmed this was the case and encouraged me to resubmit my order.  However, after doing so, the order was again cancelled. I was then contacted by the manager of the restaurant by phone and I was quite surprised that he chose to take a somewhat rude and definitely defensive tone, rather than being apologetic that (1) his restaurant was out of virtually all vegetarian offerings and (2) he had neglected to update this information online, resulting in the cancelled orders. I have never left a negative review before in my life, but I wanted to convey this feedback since it is making me seriously reconsider my future patronage.",

It had a lot of gravy & large creamy cheese curds. Yum!  My husband also got a seasonal rum drink at the bar that he loved. The bartender was very nice and accommodating. I like sweet drinks & she tried to help me find something I liked since they didn't have any sweet drinks.  We stayed for trivia, had a great time & won. We got a $25 gift card for winning.

    "text": "Ok, but I literally dream about the Quebecoise Poutine. It took me forever to finally try Franktuary, but I went at the best time (11am, just after opening) for a lunch date with my darling. I order a simple tofu dog with vegan chili and cheddar, and we share a poutine.   Everything about my meals here has been on point, and presentation is lovely too. I mean, I can't resist a classic chili dog (vegetarian style) with excellent presentation. I'm not a huge fan of the messy slop that loaded dogs often become, but I haven't seen a single dog from here come out looking unpresentable. They go the extra step to make the food look as delicious as it tastes, and sorry not sorry, but looks are everything when it comes to me and food.   Extra points are given for all of the locally sourced foods and beers. Pittsburgh and PA in general has some wonderful options for local dairy, beer, etc, so it's great to see a restaurant utilizing those resources to bring us the best ingredients.   I suspect Franktuary will be a fave for a long time to come. Staff is friendly. The space is big enough so that I don't feel crowded out. The food is quick and tasty and relatively affordable. It's a winner all around, so what's not to like?",

We started with the deep fried pierogies appetizer which was meh..ok. So here's the thing.. they just have the one \"preset\" veggie dog on the menu but their 'make your own dog' section and it's several toppings and options make the possibilities endless. The nice thing is that you can pick as many toppings as you want for no extra cost! I made my own with the veggie Italian sausage dog, garlic aioli, cheese and grilled onions. Our waitress was super sweet but didn't have any recommendations for me as I wasn't sure what goes with an Italian sausage dog! Obviously, being vegetarian I've never eaten Italian sausage so I went with my gut. It came out ok.. but not quite perfect. Our waitress was happy to bring me extra sauces/toppings on the side to 'fix' it which was nice. Try their blueberry honey mustard sauce. They have vegan bacon too but sadly had run out when we visited. The Mac n cheese is simple but yum! Overall, I liked Franktuary but there's room for improvement. I wish they had more preset veggie dogs on their menu or at least recommendations about what toppings go with what!",

The first time it was on my birthday, and the boyfriend and I got a few hot dogs and some standard fries to share. The food was delicious and the portions were exactly right...not exactly a massive basket of fries, but if that's your thing go to a greasy dive bar. Our original waiter took a few minutes getting back to our table to take our order, and come to find out she'd forgotten about us. She apologized profusely and immediately produced a gift certificate for more than the price of our meal! We ordered a few extra cocktails and left with a wonderful impression of the place.   The next time we came was for their late-night happy hour food specials on a Saturday. The half off deal on corn dogs was no longer current, but because we'd come and ordered them for that very reason our waitress gave us that price anyways. Their corn dogs are perfect by the way...hot and very crispy on the outside with the perfect amount of breading. When I crave Franktuary, it's always their corn dogs I think about!  The last time I was there was for a family birthday party. The staff expertly handled our party of fifteen by pushing three tables together and providing us with quick, excellent service throughout our visit. Nobody got the wrong food, and everyone seemed very happy with their choices. We ordered various hot dogs and multiple plates of poutine. There was about a thirty-minute wait before the meal due to it being dinner time, so several of us sat at the bar and took advantage of their delicious cocktails. The bartender was friendly and even made some custom drinks upon request. Overall my experiences here have been outstanding due to the professional friendly staff and quality food offerings. If you're going to eat a hot dog, Franktuary is the place to do it!",

We got hot dogs, the place itself is wonderful, service very friendly; we were asked to join in Bingo and won gift cards we later redeemed with our bill- which leads me to 4 stars and not 5: this swanky place is expensive! I think about 8 bucks a dog  however as far as vegan options, service, & atmosphere, this place is well worth trying.",

    "text": "Drinks=great. Poutine=great. Hotdogs=ok. Service=Good, but with one problem.  My friends and I went to Franktuary on a Saturday night. There were 7 of us. We expected a wait, and we expected it to be busy. When we got there, we were given a quote for 20-30 min. My friends gave his cell phone, and he received a text that the wait would be 35 min. So we decided to go across the street for a drink. As soon as we ordered our drinks, we got a text that our table was ready (5 minutes had gone by). That's wonderful...getting a table early is awesome. We called Franktuary to tell them we had just gotten drinks and would be over as long as they could hold the table. They said they would hold it for ten minutes. So we all paid, some of us leaving behind half empty drinks. When we got back, they had already given away our table. We made it within the ten minutes they said they would hold it for.  Aside from that, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and kind.  The hotdogs were good, but they were not as mind-blowing as I was expecting. I prefer Station Street Hotdogs for my gourmet hotdog eating. I ordered the Reykjavik. I had high expectations, as I've had a hotdog from Reykjavik before. Iceland wins. That's ok, though, because I was exciting to see such an option and think it was really cool!  Overall, good experience with a tiny hiccup. I may be back for the poutine. But I'll go to Station Street for hotdogs.",

When the windows are open out to the street it has a nice airy feel to it. I've had mixed results with the service there. Some bartenders really good, others not so much.  If you're walking were shopping in Lawrenceville and want a quick snack, this is about the only place in that section of the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I visited Franktuary on Fri. evening at 6:30 with two friends of mine for dinner.  I'd been once before for brunch a couple of years ago, but had been wanting to return to try the gourmet hot dogs, which is what they are known for, but are not served at brunch.  My friends wanted to visit a restaurant in Lawrenceville, since they rarely visit that neighborhood.  I suggested either Franktuary or Round Corner Cantina, since I had City Dining Cards for both places, and they chose here.  For our entrees, we each ordered two hot dogs.  Because I don't eat beef, I chose to get a veggie frank banh mi style ($5.75) and a veggie corndog ($4), which I was excited to see on the menu, since I'd never been able to try a corn dog before.  Of these dogs, my favorite was the former; the veggie frank was rather bland, but the banh mi topping was on point, and added a lot of flavor to it, helping to disguise the blandness.  I was not a huge fan of the corn dog, since it had nothing to disguise the blandness other than the dipping sauce that came with it--Miller's mustard in my case.  Speaking of which, the mustard was quite different than what I was expecting; I'd describe it as a sweet chili mustard, and it was rather runny--I'm a mustard connoisseur, and I'm sorry to say that I wasn't a huge fan.  Both of my friends ordered standard franks, with one ordering them in the Pittsburgh and New York styles ($5 and $4.50, respectively), and the other ordering them in Koreatown and Chicago impostor styles (both $5).  Although I didn't try their dogs, the one preferred the Pittsburgh style, but found it a bit unwieldy to eat.  The other liked both of the styles he ordered, but found the parts containing more frank bland.  In addition to our entrees, we split an order of poutine Quebecoise ($8).  I must concur with several other reviewers that the predominant flavor of the gravy was salt.  The fries were of the hand cut variety but were underseasoned; thus, the best part was the cheese curds.  I've had poutine in PGH and elsewhere, and I've definitely had better versions.  Although this was my friends' first experience with poutine, they seemed to concur, based on how little they ate.  If I were to order poutine here again, I think I'd try another version, such as the baked potato one.  We also ordered dessert, with all of us getting the parfait with chocolate mousse, brownie, and cream cheese icing ($4).  Although I wasn't originally planning to get dessert here, I'm actually glad I did, since it was the best part of the meal.  It had a moist but firm consistency, including small chunks of chocolate, and the cream cheese icing worked well with it.  Overall, I wasn't super-impressed with my latest meal here, esp. given its cost (a bit less than $40 for three people after a $10 discount).  Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed my brunch here more--at the time, they had beignets that were really good.  The church-themed atmosphere is nice, and I have no major complaints about the service, but the food is inconsistent.  If I'm in the mood for gourmet hot dogs, I think I'll head over to D's in Regent Square instead.  Having said that, I would consider returning to Franktuary for drinks, since they have a nice looking bar and interesting cocktails--I'd love to try that church wine punch!  3.5 stars.",

Poutine quebecois... was flavorless, as I had seen in some reviews but I hoped it was a fluke. I asked for extra gravy because many places don't seem to give enough, and it was so bland. The cheese curds were and fries were good, but just drowned in blandness. It could have used some salt, but I don't think seasoning would have helped... Sigh.  I also had the salmon dog with thai toppings, and while the flavors were nice, the salmon frank was a bit dry.   Am very interested in trying a more traditional dog but in the mean time I think I have to write this as a note-to-self and caution for others about that disappointing poutine.   Friendly staff. Garage door was open when I went, and the gorgeous weather made for a great dining environment.",

    "text": "Leszek and I are drawn to Lawrenceville, somehow we always end up on Butler Street. It is becoming one of our favorite streets. We ventured into Franktuary on a warm summer afternoon. We found a church themed restaurant with craft cocktails, draft beers, and a menu with some interesting options.   We sat at the bar and ordered a Stone Chipotle porter and a Caipirinha. I loved the spicy kick of the beer. The Caipirinha traditionally made with limes, sugar and Casacha was not so good. I think the bartender added club soda, so it was not what I expected.  The menu offered meatballs, sausage, chili, salads and more. Being the healthy freak that I am I was considering one of their salad options, what was I thinking! I ordered the turkey hot dog PA Dutch style with apple onion jam, melted cheddar and green onions. The roll was fresh and the first bite of the hot dog was surprisingly tasty, good flavor combos. We also had the Texan, a beef dog with chili, cheese and Jalepenos. What the hell, we ordered Poutine Philadelphie, frenchfries covered in cheese, gravy, peppers and onions.....oh my guilty conscious....but what a treat. I usually stray from unhealthy foods but at Franktuary I said fuck it and indulged and enjoyed! Take my advise, leave your healthy eating habits at the door and enjoy what Fracktuary has to offer. You won't be disappointed.  Come warm weather the front loading dock doors open up to let in the fresh air. If you want you can sit at a bar that over looks the side walk. If you want, order another hotdog, different flavor :)",

We decided to come here because they were open early and the place across the street was crowded. Drinks were good and the server was very polite and as helpful as the kitchen would allow him to be. The food tastes good, I had a zucchini fritter with a salad. I had asked for an egg with my meal and had to wait at least another 20 minutes for it after my meal had arrived. Another girl in our group was served a cold quiche. She was told that was the traditional way to serve it...never in our lives have any of us been served cold quiche. The waiter did rectify it without her asking.   We went again today out of convenience hoping they would have something relatively healthy to eat. Yes I know it's hot dog place. The only thing I wanted was the summer frittata and was told they weren't ready yet. Really? I can make one at home in less than 15 minutes and that's exactly what I wish I'd done, gone home. I got the Holy trinity combo of nicely cooked scrambled eggs, limp undercooked bacon, and a barely there salad. Then had to wait another 10 minutes for toast. And coffee is $3! Our waiter was kind and I have no complaints with the service.  If a restaurant is serving brunch across the street from one of the most popular brunch spots in Lawrenceville then your game should be tight. They have to understand they'll get their overflow so do brunch right or don't do it at all! The kitchen better get their act together.  I tried this place a second time and never again.",

I told the hostess, and she pointed me to the bar where I waited patiently (that's code for dang girl come take my order already) for the barmaid to acknowledge my presence.

Last night we decided to finally go and we left pretty happy. I ordered the Seattle with out onions and added bacon. I also had a side of bacon baked beans and it was very good. I got the standard dog.  After I finished I wanted a corn dog so I got one of those too. I was pretty full too. My boyfriend orders the Chicago imposter with pierogis and he really enjoyed it. He is not a hot dog guy so I was super excited and surprised that he liked it.   The restaurant was empty and we had not issue getting a seat. Our server was very nice and came by every often , which we liked. The restaurant was very intimate and I liked that.  We will def be coming back again ! We got 2 hotdog, a corndog, and two sides for like 25 bucks, so we were happy.",

We were able to still hold on to him with the leash. They brought him water without even asking. Food wise, can only speak of the poutine. Split the small portion for an evening snack. Very good. Lots of gravy and some nice big hunks of cheese curds.",

I ordered the Dusseldorf dog and my friends and I split a large Quebecoise poutine.   My hot dog was pretty good. The grilled onions, horsey sauce, cranberry honey mustard, and bacon made a tasty but not too overpowering combination of toppings. My friend ordered the turkey dog oahu style and my friend ordered the tofu dog bangkok style. Both of their dogs were even smaller than mine which was pretty disappointing. The tofu dog had a weird consistency and no flavor.   I was exctited to try the poutine but the gravy was very thick. The fries weren't too bad but we probably wasted half the large because it was so big and none of us really enjoyed it. Overall, I would come back for their hot dogs but maybe get two of them since they really are not that big.",

The interior decor of Franktuary blends old and new in a charming sort of way.  It is pretty fancy for a hot dog eatery.  The list of toppings in the build your own section of the menu is miles long and includes gourmet items as well as some oddities.  The oddities are the only thing that made me question their intentions.  Whip cream, gummy bears and spider tarantula(wait, back up, yes it's the real thing).  I always thought hot dogs were meant only to be savory, but I guess they think differently here.     They certainly stand out for the vegan and veggie dogs you can get here.  The tofu dog is thick and filling.  You will not go away hungry.  The beer selection is always changing and they bring in some good craft beers.     The service is really quick and efficient.  For some reason our waiter had really bad timing the last time I visited.  He came over to introduce himself and interrupted me mid sentence.  Also, he kept asking us things when we had our mouths full of food.  It didn't really matter because he was quick and pleasant.",

    "text": "I am generally not a fan of hot dogs - but Franktuary is the wonderful exception to this. I consider them a super tasty treat, especially since this location in particular is very popular.  I've been able to dine here a handful of times, sometimes with friends and sometimes just during a day with me, myself and I. The food has consistently been to die for. During one dinner with friends I tried the oahu frank, which was piled so high with topping goodness that it probably could have come with a warning and extra napkins. And the poutine! We all happily split a pile of fresh cut fries, complete with a layer of gravy underneath that mountain of potatoes, topped off with some cheese curds. Everyone was impressed, including a friend who admitted he usually isn't big on poutine. During another visit I was super excited to sample their brunch menu for the first time. That time I got another super tasty frank complete with a Pimm's cocktail, because I believe in treating myself. Not only was the cocktail delightful, but since I came for brunch, my amazing bacon and cheddar topped frank also included a fried egg. Yum. All of the yum!  What holds me back from giving this place a 5 star rating is the repeat problems related to seating and service. It seems that whenever I step into this place the front host is busy helping with an issue at one of the tables. I'm not at all bashing the staff for doing their job and helping to address those problems, but I've admittedly come to expect that no one will able to greet me right away when I walk into this place. Additionally, the servers always seem super busy. They definitely do an amazing job juggling large numbers of people, so all of the kudos to them - but I wish more helping hands could be brought in to lighten their workload (and, yes, to improve the speed of the service). The slowdowns I've regularly experienced are clearly no one person's fault, and since the food is always top notch I more or less shrug and plan accordingly. Still, it's admittedly my dream to come in and enjoy a meal without watching and worrying about servers and bartenders literally jogging to and from the kitchen.  Definitely visit this place when you have the time to do so - the food is amazing and the atmosphere is very relaxing and chill, and I personally am always excited at the idea of returning to Franktuary!",

I ordered an Amaretto Sours and was charged $7 for the amaretto and then an additional $3 for the sours. Most of the drinks were $10+.   Our server, Jonathan, was great. Even with a large party and a busy Saturday night, he was attentive. We didn't wait long for drinks or food, the table was cleared off quickly and the checks were ready to go when we were.

If you're a vegan and miss that chicken nugget taste/texture then I would recommend  ordering the garbanzo fries.  They were tasty and perfectly fried.  Also, way better for you than traditional french fries.  The veggie chili was a hit with me.  I would order that again.  They also have a vegan lemon dessert but we were too full to try it.

The ambiance was great; a nice, cozy joint to enjoy your food and drinks. Service was fast and polite and the food was good as well. We got a meatball sandwich and a frank with an order of fries (btw garlic aioli is a must!). Everything was great! However I am giving this place a three because it is highly overpriced for what it offers. It is a hot dog joint and for the order above (plus 2 sodas) we paid 22$ ! I will definitely try it again if I am around but I am not sure I will decide to drive 20 mins just for to have a lunch/dinner at this place.   Ah also we went on a really cold night and it felt like there was barely any heating :)",

The atmosphere is great, with old church pews and other repurposed objects decorating the restaurant. The staff is always super friendly and service has been exceptionally speedy every time I've been here.   The food is great, with more of a selection here than at the downtown location. All of the hot dogs are good, but be sure to ask about whatever monthly special they have going on. The Memphis is a personal favorite of mine. They also have local hot dogs and sausages and source a bunch of other ingredients from local farms. And whatever you do, get the poutine. Seriously, it's amazing.   They also have a pretty good beer selection and they can pour a mean cocktail.",

I'm a traditionalist and the poutine Quebecois was everything that I could have wanted. There are also other varieties, and I sampled the poutine Buffalo, which was topped with wing-style toppings. It was quite good and just the right amount of spice.  The waitstaff was courteous, polite, & attentive. He checked with us frequently and offered enough guidance to be helpful but not to be pushy.  Definitely recommended.",

They don't just do hot dogs -- they have great pierogies and a scrumptious thing called \"beetballs,\" which are the best vegetarian version of a meat product that I've ever eaten.  EDIT: I've been to Franktuary 4 times now -- the first three times, with 5-star service, and now a fourth with...let's round it up to 2-star. So I've averaged out my star-count to reflect that, and I'm here revising my comment about the universally great service.   *Most* times, including on busy Saturday nights, service at the bar is terrific. But you might experience the odd Thursday night where the bartender, working alone, tends to ignore you, you'll watch some random guy spend half a freaking hour fiddling with the AV equipment instead of helping customers, and you'll wait almost 20 minutes just to pay the bill, at which point you'll angrily math out your own bill, leave cash/tip under your drink, and hope none of the \"Are you leaving yet?\" hipsters take it before the tender deigns to notice.  But at least 75% of the time, it will be a splendid experience.",

    "text": "Franktuary is a welcome addition to the growing Butler Ave district in Lawrenceville.  Its atmosphere is half-bar, half-cosy restaurant with the exposed brick and mix of old and new that is popular in the loft apartments in the neighborhood.  There is a good list of cocktails and beers on draft and in bottles.  The menu focuses on various gourmet dogs, sausages, meatballs, and varieties of french fries (including poutine and garbanzo fries).  Pierogies and vegetarian versions of all of the above are on there too.    I found the atmosphere, service, cocktails, and piergoies to be great, but the hot dogs and french fries were fairly lackluster.  I'd recommend going there for drinks (and some appetizers) before or after eating at one of the other dining options nearby.  It does have large tables that make it easy for a large group to eat or drink together, so if you have a bunch of friends looking for somewhere reasonably inexpensive (and have vegetarians or vegans in the bunch), it might be worth the tradeoff incurred by eating the main courses of food.",

We went around the members of our party to see if we were all OK with what would be a hot dog/sausage dinner, and when they came to me I said \"I am in heaven.\" I relate this part of the visit because I review this restaurant as someone with sausagemaking in my heritage.  I liked Fraktuary a lot. The atmosphere was perfect for this part of Pittsburgh. The service was equally remarkable. The menu was eclectic yet varied sufficiently that all members of our group found something of interest. The food combinations that we had were well prepared and quite delicious.  There really is nothing negative to say about the meal whatsoever.  The issues that I have with this restaurant have to do with the cognitive dissonance of dining in an upscale hot dog restaurant. I just could not get past the fact that I was paying $15 for what amounts to a dog, fries and a beer. I can see bringing people here for the upscale atmosphere, but I think I would be otherwise uncomfortable treating someone to a meal as simple as a frankfurter, if it were that special of an occasion.  Therefore, if I want a stadium dog, I will find someplace more 'downscale' and if I have a special occasion, I will look for a more upscale menu.",

    "text": "Upscale hotdogs seems like quite a paradox but I decided to give Franktuary a try due to the availability of poutine as well as my dining partners affinity for hotdogs (get your mind out of the gutter).  Everyone I know who has had poutine has raved about it and, to my knowledge, this is the only place in Pittsburgh that is serving it up.  The setup of Franktuary is very open and there are quite a few tables which was great because we didn't wait to be seated.  There was a hipster ambiance to the place overall but I was already expecting that due to its location in Lower Lawrenceville.  The front window located near the bar doubled as a sort of garage door that had the ability to open up and would be a terrific place to post up for some sunny afternoon cocktails.  Unfortunately, I came here during a drowning January rain so I was unable to partake.  After looking at the cocktail/beer menu, I will have to keep this thought buried in the back of my head for a day with better weather as the cocktails looked like they would be excellent.  I ended up ordering the Poutine Quebecois and an \"Under Dog\" New Yorker Style (sweet onion sauce, kraut and brown mustard).   The food took longer than expected to come out which was surprising for hot dogs and fries but when it arrived it was still hot so I'll give them a pass on that.  The Poutine Quebecois was first up.  My first experience with this dish ended up with mixed emotions.  The parts of the fries with the gravy and cheese curds were amazing but I would have liked to see more of those ingredients on the rest of the portion of fries.  I'm still going to say it was quite delicious.  My dog was very tasty but at close to 4.50 a dog I wanted to be absolutely blown away.  Maybe I should have gone a little more adventurous with my toppings.  All in all, I think the food was pretty good and I'm going to rate this place 3 stars for the time being.  However, I will add that I will be returning to try the cocktails and possibly another style of dog in the future.",

There is more of a selection here than 'D's six packs and dogs' and cheaper than 'Station Street' dogs. I appreciate the premium grass fed beef dogs. They cater well to vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free customers.    It's got a small bar area, which is great when you're stopping in solo, or just want to have a drink.  The beer selection is small, but generally interesting.  The cocktails list is top notch.   My service here has always been pleasant.

So, yeah I had pierogi, but the real reason we came here was for the drinks. And drinks we had! Awesome, refreshing and classic Mai Thias and Daiquiris, to be precise. I was really thrilled to see these two warm weather drinks on the menu and done in the simple, old fashioned way -- no blender or crushed ice here, my friends.   The service was good at the bar, and I enjoyed being part of what seemed like a regular crowd -- friends gathered, fun conversations and a bartender who was interactive and quick.   I'm not entirely sure what's keeping me from giving Franktuary a full five stars, as I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Compared to other places in Pittsburgh, it wasn't as mind-blowing or as much of a revelation, but it's a great spot and I'd totally hit it up again. Especially for those pierogi, man!",

    "text": "Went to Franktuary for the first time today with my girlfriend and was overall disappointed.  The building itself is pretty cool. I like that they kept the refurbished church look considering the original place. Lots of room to move, pretty comfortable seating for hardwood, and nothing was crazy wobbly or broken. Only downside would be that since the front is all glass it got a little chilly up front, but that's common sense so seat yourself appropriately.  Our server was good. Quick, attentive, not.overbearing, all good. Not sure about the cocktails, but me and my girlfriend both got a laugh out of how AWFULLY the bartender pulled a draft. Good lord, she must've had 2in of foam once it was all said and done, so be aware. The beer selection is pretty good though and all local or at least from PA (today. Wouldn't be shocked if it changed)  As for the food it was good if you understand and accept the following: 1) the menu is 90% hotdogs and there really isn't enough you can do to a frank to make it but so different.  2) unless you don't eat much, have the cash to burn, or go during happy hour you're not eating to get full.  3) these are REGULAR size franks with a very irregular price tag.  Don't get me wrong, the hotdogs were delicious, but when they START at $3.50 before any condiments I expected a sizable dog. That wasn't the case. On top of that all sides are separate, which is fine, but $4 for the equivalent of a medium fry at Mcdonald's is absurd. I know how much food costs and you can afford to give a basket of fries for the sae price unless you don't know where to buy affordable ingredients. For a down-under dog, a veggie sausage, fries and a beer I spent $22 and was hungry again within a couple hours.  It's a cool spot, great if you don't mind spending the money for a pretty light meal, also great if you go during happy hour (4pm-6pm, 1/2 price dogs, $2 drafts), but unless that's the position I'm in I can't see myself ever going back. You just do not get enough for your money and thats enough reason for me.",

Back in the day (college days to be specific) I loved the Frantuary. I am wondering if I was maybe just drunk? These days, I get really irritated when I cannot get a calorie free beverage aside from water in a restaurant. I honestly cannot tolerate drinking plain tap water with food and no, no I do not want your hipster Boylan's, OK?! I get it, you don't want me to die from terrible chemicals or high fructose corn syrup. But a Diet Pepsi MIGHT have made your blasphemous rip on poutine more tolerable.   Probably not.    Anyway, we ordered 2 plates of Poutine Quebecois. It was bland and didn't have enough cheese curds. My friend stopped eating his after the curds were gone. Since there were 5 on his place, more than half the fries were left. I ate more of mine because I was hungry, but did not finish my plate (which is basically unheard of, as I am a glutton). Gravy was totally tasteless. No salt and tasted like it was thickened with corn starch. A really, really WEAK dish that needs to be totally reworked or taken off the menu.   I don't know, I guess because my previous positive experiences, I would give Frankuary a chance to atone for their transgressions but no any time soon.",

The veggie dogs are the same boring dogs you can get anywhere, but the different executions make them slightly more interesting. I haven't tried the veggie sausage, I think it might have egg in it (example of how a menu indication could be useful).   Beet balls = yum!   Garbanzo fries, also a hit!   Some of the cocktails are way overpriced. The \"Refugio\" is a nice enough mezcal drink, but it's $14 and not up to par with Salt or Cantina's less pricey concoctions. It was not particularly strong, like a mezcal drink should be; it was rather on the sweet side and was lacking the bitter and sour elements of the grapefruit ingredient. Plus, it is served in a coupe with a plastic straw, which seems tacky and pointless (the straw). I had another even less impressive drink there on my first visit, which I cannot remember...The bartender seems sincere in his efforts, so I hope he can fine tune things a bit, and get the prices in line.",

The brew selection is very good with rotating taps always with some local craft selections. Franktuary also boasts craft cocktails which I have yet to try.   I guess the hot dogs are sort of pricey for the size ($5-$8), but the toppings and styles are innovative and unique. I've tried the Memphis and a Thai version which were both nice twists on the classic American hot dog.   The staff is great; friendly with a hint of hipster smugness. Chris the bartender is knowledgeable about the beer and liquor selection. The owner is around frequently and has a knack for customer service.  The restaurant space has a modern flair mixed with an old churchy vibe (ie. stained glass, candles, pews for seating). It is also pretty cool that the customers can see right into the kitchen and watch all the cooks at work preparing the different sauces and hot dogs.   Franktuary fits right into the up and coming Lawerenceville vibe.",

    "text": "Franktuary is a little tough to review.  It is all about the hot dogs, and trust me, I do love a good hot dog.  Something about it makes me think of summer and baseball.  But hot dogs are a blank slates and that is basically what you start with here, then build it up.  I guess my biggest issue is the price.  And I don't seem to be alone here:) these are REGULAR size dogz, not 1/4 LB dogs.  I got two the Chicago Dog, and something called the Italian Dog that I haven't seen on the menu now, but it had basil olive oil mozzarella, and tomatoes on it.  I may be leaving out an ingredient there, so I apologize.  Now as for the  service and what not, I can't rate it, as I had my husband pick these up for me on his lunch break and bring them to me.  I was in the mood for a good dog and heard this was a great stop.  The two again \"regular sized dogs\" were about $10.00.  Not trying to sound cheap here but REALLY??? you can go to Sheetz and get two dogs for like a buck and they are the same size....  Anyhow they were good, but just that.  Certainly not $10.00 good for a hot dog and certainly not filling for a lunch.  I think this place is worth a try just to say you did it, but I wouldn't make it a regular stop.  Maybe I will try it again in the future and maybe not.",

    "text": "I guess I should congratulate Franktuary for serving the third best hot dog in Pittsburgh.  What a HUGE disappointment!  How can a place that claims to honor the hot dog serve such a bad dog?  Regardless of the topping the physical wiener is the heart of it all. This one just doesn't cut the mustard.  It is thin, bland, was missing that delightful snap and was so small that it seemed to swim in the bun.  My wife and I both ordered a beer and a hot dog while there.  I had the Chicago Impostor and she had the Mexican.  The city of Chicago should mourn that someone would liken this offering to their glorious dog.  Because the wiener is so small it had too many toppings.  The toppings also sucked.  Halved cherry tomatoes and a gross relish.  As for my wife's mexico dog she said that she couldn't really remember much about it 45 minutes after we ate.  That should say it all.  The poutine fries we tried were also overly salty.  I guess my problem with this and a lot of the hipster restaurants in the Lawrenceville area is that no one cares if it is local and sustainable if it isn't good or better than the original.   One final note, I found it offensive to chefs around the world that the guy making poutine and hot dogs felt the need to rock a chef's coat.  I guess if I have white jump suit and a model rocket I can call myself an astronaut",

    "text": "Frankly, I've been a fervid fan of Franktuary franks for like forever! For real. The downtown location is one of my fave lunch spots to grab and go on a busy lunch hour. Even better is sitting comfortably with a cocktail or a beer late in the evening relaxing with friends. No, not downtown, but at the NEW location in Lawrenceville.   Same great hot dogs - regular Boar's Head, locavore, fish frank for Lent, a veggie dog and some other quite nice dog selections - as the original downtown site. Besides that, check out the outstanding garbanzo fries, poutine, salads and even desserts! Yes, the menu is bigger and better than downtown. Bigger space + bigger kitchen = bigger selection. And the menu is gluten-free friendly! BIG kudos!   (Just a note here. Another reviewer slammed the gluten-free bun at Franktuary. He stated, \"Unsure of which type of bun to choose, and being that I'm unmoved by whole wheat bread, I went for a gluten-free roll and found it to be as arid as those pitiful meatballs, crumbling in my hands, so much so that I ate the meat with plastic utensils and tossed the bread in the trash.\" HEADS UP! A gluten-free bun is crumbly because IT HAS NO GLUTEN! Gluten is what gives normal bread structure and substance. Don't slam Franktuary for a gluten-free bun that does what it naturally does. Thank you, Franktuary, for having GF buns and ignore the remarks of the gluten-free unenlightened.)  Then there's the bar. A hot dog joint with a BAR?! Yes. Not just any bar either. The cocktails are the creation of the lovely and talented Marie Periello of The Stir Society. If you're a fan of a dirty martini, you just may enjoy a little twist with a Holy Cow using Boyd & Blair vodka, pickle juice, beef boullion, caper berries (mmmmm...) and pepper...nicely spicy! Enjoy a refreshing sangria? The Church Wine Punch kicks it up a notch with a touch of Scotch to the mix. Delightful.  Don't think because the Lville spot is open that Franktuary has abandoned downtown. Nope. Lunch time will still find me stopping for a quick dog bite often at the original location.   Further. For a frank on the fly, find the Franktuary Truck. You'd be fortunate!",

Although we love the poutine and recommend splurging for extra cheese curds, the menu is full of tasty options. They also have great specials, but they seemed to be a little quirky. They always have a shorter beer list of mostly local beers. The service is always top notch and I can't explain why, but they always seem to skillfully walk the attentive/aloof service line perfectly. Additionally, they have fountain Boylan sodas. Highly recommend.",

The menu holds promise with the styles of dogs, the interior has an interesting mix of ambiance and decor.  For five or six bucks a specialty hot dog, there better be some differentiation, and unfortunately it is just not there.  You would think the dogs would be high quality made in house or at least by a local butcher, we saw them opening packages of the same hot dogs you could find in a supermarket.  The fries we tried twice, both times the gravy was off tasting and overly salty.  The last time we ordered a corn dog in addition to several other varieties.  The disinterested waiter brought a veggie dog instead, which we tried to stomach but was terrible.  At the same time the other food was cold, I find it difficult to understand how a single cook in an empty restaurant can send out wrong and cold food (you put chili on pre cooked hot dogs all day).  Perhaps she was too concerned about applying the perfect ribbon of mustard.",

Already, that makes me sick to my stomach. I walk in and see church decor - strike No. 1. The hotdogs are disgusting. They have almost no flavor - toppings, included - and they're those generic, thin hotdogs, not the thick kind you would expect should you be going to a restaurant specializing in hot dogs. On top of this, they don't offer any sides along with your hotdogs (I.E.two hotdogs and a side of salad, fries, chips, etc.) No, forget it. Everything is extra - as is the case with these indie restaurants. This is yet another independent restaurant that fails miserably here in Pittsburgh. I will gladly stick with the chain restaurants. And yes, you can make a far better hotdog for far less $$ at home.",

The menu is simple so everything that you order is sure to impress.  I tried several dogs that night and I kind of regret the third choice, not because it wasn't good but because I think two is enough from most anyone especially if you get fries. Speaking of fries the fries were delicious. I hear the cheese curd fries are also awesome, something you will be hard pressed to find elsewhere I'm sure.   Decent beer selection and a variety of meat and even veggie hot dog options makes Franktuary a happy place, even for your weird vegan friends.

The portion was a good size to split, but the cheese curds weren't the best, they were kind of cold. The gravy and the fries were good though.   The Oahu dogs were also good, my boyfriend was unsure about the pineapple on it at first, but after a recommendation from our waitress, he tried it out and was very pleased!

Whether you are someone who likes a good beef dog, prefers turkey dogs, a vegetarian, or a vegan, there are many options for you!  Off the menu you can go with one of their premade dogs or make your own. The make your own topping list is so long! They have everything on there from onions, to sauces, to SPRINKLES! You can also pick what kind of bun you'd like. I went with the veggie corn dog and a turkey dog with Just ketchup and onions. The turkey dog was delish! I looooved it. The veggie corn dog was not very good. I did not like the flavor of the veggie dog and my breading was soft and limp. I'll take a morning star corndog over this any day. I also had a side of the cole slaw (you can pick creamy or vinegar based), I had vinegar. It was very spicy. I think it would be better on a dog than alone. They had root beer on tap which my husband got and it was so fresh and sweet!   It's a pretty quick meal without being rushed. We will definitely be back to try the veggie Italian sausage and to get another turkey dog, yum!",

Although I have none, there were vegan and gluten free options. I built my own hot dog, but my boyfriend had the corn dog and the Icelandic hot dog (can't spell the name! haha) and we loved all three. The fries were crispy and tasty. The bar tender was our waiter and he was super friendly and attentive.   We will definitely be back to take advantage of Tuesday trivia night or third Thursday beer pairing special.",

The kids menu was enjoyed by our kids and the adults indulged on some awesome fried pickle chips, onion rings, poutine and of course gourmet hotdogs. This place was a great lunch spot for our weekend getaway. The mini Lawrenceville downtown strip was a nice stroll in a nice hot day.",

There really should be some equivalence between the ingredients so you don't end up with just brown-tinged lettuce.

I had the Texan dog which was chili, cheddar & jalapenos. I also had a small poutine quebecois which was gravy, cheese curds & shallots. Could have used more shallots. Happy hour was over so I went with Great Divide Heydey IPA. Beer was cold & fresh. I think this place is a tad pricey for hotdogs since they aren't foot longs nor are they giant & fat dogs. Just basic. Nothing wrong with them, it's just that $30 with tip for a hot dog, poutine & 2 beers is a lot IMHO. Maybe I'm old!",

Our waitress clearly did not know the happy hour specials either, even though I quickly located the specials on the back side of the menu.  Then it came time to order. Originally I wanted the Korean dog, but they were out of kimchi (basically the most important part). I settled with the Pittsburgh and Philly Tubesteak. Neither were anything spectacular.

    "text": "I came here the other day with a friend before going to Art All Night, an event that was happening a couple streets away. I had been here once or twice before and hadn't had anything very memorable but it's a nice spot with unique and interesting food so I wanted to go back and I knew it would also be an easy bite to eat before going to the event. My friend and I decided to order onion rings to start off with which was absolutely the right move. Like I said before, I had never had anything memorable there... until now. These onion rings were amazing! I wouldn't say I'm a big fan of onion rings but I loved these and they were possibly the best I've ever had. The onions were sweet and strong with a very delicious tempura type batter that seemed to be lightly seasoned, with what I don't know. The menu suggests that u get the chipotle aioli on the side and I definitely second that! It was tangy and complemented the rings very well. It also wasn't too spicy for those who are hesitant. Shortly after the rings came out we received our hotdogs. I ordered the Oahu but added jalapenos on top because I like some spice in my life and I think it goes good with pineapple. Overall my hotdog was pretty good, the dog itself was nice with a crunchy casing but the flavors of the toppings didn't necessarily compliment each other very well, still good though. My friend ordered the Reykjavik and while I didn't try it, she seemed to enjoy it. For those of you are are very adventurous or just like to take a ride on the wild side they have an option to create your own hotdog. Toppings include, sprinkles, gummy bears, and a fried tarantula, as well as many many others! Apparently those tarantulas run out quickly so maybe call ahead of time if you're feeling spider for dinner.",

Our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to building our own, and offered great suggestions. They had tables you can sit at as well as a bar where they had a TV that had the pens game on. I will definitely be back for more!",

A nice French foerign ring to it, eh?  At any other restaurant a plate of fries with a tiny scoop of chili and a few cheese crumbles would cost about $2.95.  And you know the hot dogs they sell at gas stations - the ones in the glass-enclosed griller gizmos - the hot dogs that have turned so long on the hot pipes they've been transformed into dessicated meat cylinders?  Well, that's what our hot dogs were like; overcooked is an understatement. And what kind of place serves hot dogs without having some mustard on the table?  We had to ask and were brought a tiny steel cup of the stuff.  Come on, mustard is not that expensive.  I guess we should feel lucky we weren't charged extra.    My suggestion?  If you want a good hot dog (instead of a gourmet 'experience') find a decent coney: you'll have better food and save money.",

I have tried two of the dogs: the buffalo (wing sauce, celery, and bleu cheese) and the Memphis (potato sticks, barbecue sauce, and slaw). Both were good, and I've gotten the buffalo on several subsequent visits. I am also a fan of the fries for which various dipping sauces are available. A friend of mine ordered the poutine (and I of course stole some) and it was also delicious.

Maybe, I expected wrong, but I expected it to be cheesier and i expected the fries to be a little better, but don't get me wrong, I am glad I was able to try poutine, I will definitely have to try poutine every chance I get.  As for the hotdog - I got the Bollywood style (hello, I had to!) - but then again, maybe that wasn't the best choice. I got the \"under-dog\" version - I couldn't tell too much of a difference though.  Beer selection is decent and the people are welcoming. We did try the poutine \"dessert\" as well, and it was OK. I want to go back and try a different style for the hotdog and give the poutine another try (not dissing on the vegan gravy - we had vegetarians among us so it was good that that was vegan - but maybe I expected the gravy to be a bit meatier in taste)  Then again, I am not the best judge for poutine. I still loved the place, and I will try to go back soon to try another style of hotdog.",

Actually, I was pretty confused by all the portions sizes because everyone else's portions seemed quite small and then my portion was monstrous -- I ended up only eating ~1/3 of it and giving some of it away to my hungry friends who didn't order such a large entree and were still hungry, and I STILL had leftovers for the next day.   Regarding the food itself -- it was actually a \"Mexican\" themed chicken and waffle, which came with a cornbread waffle and mole sauce. I found the waffle to feel... gritty? I'm not sure if it was the cornmeal they used but I've made cornmeal waffles before without such a pronounced graininess. My favorite part was the chicken, which was really crispy and not greasy at all. It was a little soggy the next day, but that was to be expected.   Overall, pretty good experience, though I don't think I'd come back unless invited -- I wouldn't want to get an entree and leave hungry!",

    "text": "I've given it several tries now and honestly, it's just not even close to worth it.  The prices are laughable for what you get when you take into consideration the quality. The poutine is fairly dour, compare it to the offering at Park Brugges (a pricier place but the same price for poutine) and you'll see what I mean. The gravy is all salt no flavor, the fries are so so, and the cheese curds never taste particularly fresh.   The standard buns and dogs (which you'll get if you don't want to spend seven dollars per hotdog) are nothing to write home about, but they're fine. Last time I went the buns were stale but that was a one time thing from what I could tell. The choices for variety of toppings are plentiful, but most of them just run together.   The side of fries is about the size of a medium fry from Wendy's, so don't expect to be able to share it.  Oh I'm sorry, frittes.   The beer selection is okay but way overpriced, it's lazy to just slap a six dollar price point on all your beer that isn't Straub (still over three dollars, come on man), they should range from 4-7 or so. Haven't bothered with the ten dollar cocktails (sorry, \"libations\" see: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonion.com%2Farticles%2Fdude-with-knit-hat-at-party-calls-beer-libations%2C32433%2F&s=eca5ce90fb095106f15f7bfd741c512bc25d5b655012d8f727768f7281a6f27c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">theonion.com/articles/du...</a> )  The service is good though. Last time I went my wife's veggie dogs were ice cold and the server was rather penitent about it, and clearly seemed pissed at the kitchen staff. It was busy and took fifteen minutes to get them redone, I'm not quite sure what kitchen doesn't prioritize re-fires, that's been SOP in every restaurant I've worked in. Ordered poutine and the kitchen just never made it, which was nice of them. But again the servers are really nice and make up for the bad eggs in the kitchen.   For the price you are much better off going somewhere else. The portions and quality are just subpar. I've enjoyed the downtown location but the Lawrenceville one just seems like a scam to fleece hipsters of their parents' money when they're too dense to realize they could get more elsewhere.",

    "text": "You can't put a silk blouse on a pig.   My girlfriend and I eat out in the Burgh very often and are always looking for places to find another great dining experience.   We've driven past Frantuary enough times to stop in one night after the a concert.   She said \"Hey how about a snack, what about Frantuary?\" as we drove past the restaurant on Butler. What sounded like a good idea became a very lackluster experience.  I'm a vegetarian and my girl eats beef (no pun intended) so she ordered the house dog, I opted for the veggie sausage.   For $5.50, I expected this sausage would be a decent size. I ordered it with the onion/pepper sauteed medley with spicy brown mustard. She had the beef dog with cheddar and chili. Both on a potato bun and we both shared some frites.   Yum...until the food came.   This veggie dawg was the smallest sausage I ever saw. 3 bites and it was done. It was like they opened a package of veggie dogs from Whole Foods and threw it on a bun.   They are called Hot Dogs for a reason but mine was luke warm. My girls dog was also barely warm and tasted like it was boiled.   Unsatisfied we mulled the thought of ordering another dog each but decided against it. Its not worth the price, we spent over $20 + tip and I felt ripped off, imagine if we were having another dog plus a few beers. We could easily be over the $50 mark.   Ridiculous.   I'm from NY, where hot dogs are cheap and of a decent size and is grilled to a juicy perfection. They are not over priced and served in ceramic bowls with forks.   I want my hot dog in a paper boat, and a greasy mustard dispenser, maybe its just me but one day someone will get it right and open a hot dog spot that actually sells hot dogs and not some lame yuppy hipster hangout.",

    "text": "We were drawn into Franktuary on a late night stroll and I'm quite happy we made the stop. Our waiter, Mike M., was great about answering our questions about the menu and giving us speedy, friendly service. We ordered a beer, a Ginzer mixed drink, poutine and 2 hot dogs.   We found out after ordering they have a happy hour from 10pm-12am on Fridays and Saturdays Saturdays and what we ordered happened to be included. I was very happy to see our meal was only $21! The poutine was delicious, especially combined with the garlic aioli sauce on the side. Their fries are REALLY GOOD. I had the buffalo fries before and they were great also.   I would say the hot dogs are just OK. A bit pricey when it isn't happy hour. I went with potato bread which I thought was much better than the whole wheat my boyfriend had. We both went with beef dogs and I think they're either boiled or maybe just not as grilled as I like them...wasn't too impressed with the dog itself.  The Pittsburgh topping that I ordered included a pierogi and coleslaw. Despite being made with vegan mayo, the coleslaw was pretty good! The pierogi was nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the Reykjavic topping (remoulade, onions, ketchup, mustard and onion crunch) which I thought was a great topping.   They have a lot of vegan and gluten-free options and even have a statement on the menu about working around dietary restrictions. I'd probably give it another try during happy hour, but it's a bit pricey for an OK hot-dog otherwise.",

This morning I was meeting some girlfriends for brunch at Cocoa Cafe, but the hostess there couldn't even give us an estimate of when a table for 6 would be available. So, we crossed Butler to Franktuary, and I'm so happy we did! We were seated right away, key because we were starting to get hungry at this point. My meal was delicious, bacon, eggs, and French fries sounds like the perfect brunch to me! Those French fries are so delicious too, this is why I'm so excited to go back, would love to try more! I would recommend the Brunch Punch too, but also my friends had some bloody Marys that looked amazing. Our waitress, Delaney I believe, was wonderful! I can't say enough about this place!",

Clean and open but loud.  Made it hard to talk with Dana across the table.   The garage door walls were open and the breeze was nice.   The prices are a little ridiculous for the basic dog.  $3.5-4?  Come on.  Lower the cost of the dogs and increase the topping style costs.   So the dogs came.    There is nothing.  Repeat nothing! Special about a basic beef wiener on a potato bun.  The toppings were fresh and well prepared.   But it doesn't make us ever want to come back.     Ever!  Don't get me wrong , the dogs, when topped, are good.  I just don't think they will be able to sustain a regular, dependable crowd at these prices.    We left hungry and feeling tricked out of $20+",

All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by by vegan dog and the fact that I wasn't disgusted by it.    I had fairly low expectations of a \"vegan\" hot dog but it wasn't bad at all...it actually tasted, looked and had a similar consistency of an all beef hot dog.  I got mine prepared \"Memphis\" style which meant it had cole slaw, bbq sauce and potato sticks as toppings.  I feel like the cole slaw was overwhelming and wish there was more bbq sauce.    I tried some of the frites which were fresh although there wasn't many to \"share\".  The atmosphere/decor and the type of food you get here don't quite match but it seems to work in an odd way.

The style of their menu is sort of like \"build your own\" hot dog, but they also have a set menu. I really enjoyed my Chicago style impostor hot dog and all of the different styles of fries they offer. They also have  a really good beer selection. They staff is also very nice and fun. My friend once asked for ketchup with her hot dog, and the waitress and I laughed and joked about her lack of hot dog cultural awareness.  I give this a four because I can't quite remember the pricing, but I'm sure it wasn't a steal. Anyway, it's a great menu that hits the spot every time and quality food and drinks!  There is street parking which can be quite the hassle on some nights but you can usually find something within that block pretty easily.",

We arrived for an early lunch and was greeted by a nice young girl who sat us fairly quickly. She then brought us both waters to enjoy while we browsed the menu. We were then greeted by our server, Penny who overalls gave us a really nice experience. She helped with all my vegan questions as well as helping my husband pick the toppings on his dog.   I decided to have the poutine, vegan style. It was very tasty and the mushroom gravy was so delicious! I wish the fries were cooked just a tad bit longer, also they came out about 5 minutes before the rest of our food, bad timing on the kitchen I guess. But no complaints!   I had the vegan tofu dog, Chicago style on the whole wheat bun. It again was even more tasty than when I tried it from the food truck.   My husband had the standard hotdog with a few of his own toppings, there are so many to pick from so you better be careful you don't over do it and ruin your doggie! Some of the toppings I would assume were just jokes like gummy worms and sprinkles but hey maybe it's a real thing I just haven't discovered yet.   He also had the tater tot tower which was a tot of three different stuffed flavors - Ruben, buffalo cheese and cheddar bacon. It was served with ranch and he said it was good.   I wish the dogs were maybe grilled a bit longer or are they even grilled? I'm not exactly sure but everything was very tasty I would for sure come back!",

We ordered a large poutine and the fries were good, but there was some herb or spice in the gravy that I didn't like - I can't pinpoint it. My boyfriend ordered the Pittsburgh and Texan and liked both - he liked the Pittsburgh better which is surprising since he usually devours anything with chili and cheese. I ordered a corn dog and the Franksgiving. They were out of mashed potatoes so I got a pierogi instead - which is kind of like mashed potatoes except it's inside of a noodle. The Franksgiving wasn't bad but I think it wasn't my favorite because of the gravy that I wasn't a fan of.

You can add a pirate sword or little umbrella if you're feeling up to it! Clearly, I was. There are some toppings that seemed a little too adventurous for me, such as gummy bears or the $20 zebra tarantula! The second time I added avocado, chipotle aioli, and cheese curds. Both dogs were delicious! The snappy franks are a lot better than the skinless ones. I just wish they were bigger. They're not terribly priced though, so it's not a big deal to order 2 or more. I recommend this place! I'm not sure what practicing Christians would think of the aesthetic...",

Excellent, because they're serving a variety of delicious gourmet dogs and bar-menu type foods at more than fair prices. They're open a little later than most of the Lawrenceville locations, 10:30pm (11:30 on Saturdays). Plus, they have a full service bar.   I had the Pittsburgh (pierogi topped dog) and the poutine. Both were really great. If you aren't into hot dogs they have a variety of starters, salads, and sides that may hit the spot.  If you want to try something a little different, give Franktuary a try.",

We called to see if there was seating available being a few blocks down the road and they advised us there was more than enough open tables and bar seating. We get there and have to stand at the door for almost ten minutes before sitting in the corner against the window by the bar. The bartender leans over the bar to try and take our order but was being kinda rude about it and seemed to have a attitude. Maybe it was just a bad day or maybe understaffed but sometimes you just gotta keep your cool and relax. My friends had some hot dogs and beers but I got the poutine fries cause that's normally my go to when I come here. Well this time around the gravy was very salty and the cheese was pretty hard like maybe it's been sitting out and got stale. so it was not enjoyable at all for me we got out of there pretty quick being our backs where almost up against people at the bar. If I return here I'll be sure not to come back on a weekend night.",

Yes tomato jam, if you like catsup you should try the tomato jam. Even if you don't like catsup try the tomato jam. They also had fries made from chickpeas. They were a good switch from potato. I just wish they were crisper. Also went with the church basement punch which was perfect and warming on this cold rainy day.",

It's good for dinner with friends, it's good for dinner with my kids, and it's good for dropping in to have a drink and a bite by myself. I've tried a variety of dogs and not been disappointed yet - my go-to is a custom build with a snappy frank, grass fed chili, yellow mustard, onion, and kraut. The Larryville Mule is the best drink on their alcohol menu - TRY ONE! They've a good beer list and plenty of tasty food options. The miso kale salad is delicious, as is the poutine. Plenty of good options for vegans as well. Franktuary has become a frequently visited place in my house.",

The bar area is set off from the main dining area and it has an old school feel to it.  I would definitely like to come back and try some of their unique drinks.  I had a root beer which they had on tap and it was one of the best root beers I have ever tasted.  This was a great start to the experience, unfortunately it kind of went downhill from there.  The service was a little odd.  Our server was very awkward and barely spoke.  Further, she forgot a side of ours and I had to go to the kitchen to get it.  She then forgot silverware and I had to go get that myself as well.  When we were done she just put down the check and walked away, no words at all.  For an appetizer I ordered the fried pretzel bites which comes with 2 different mustard types.  The spicy mustard was delicious.  The fried pretzels, while different, were just kind of average.  They seemed over cooked and lacked flavor.    For my main meal I went with the New Yorker hot dog.  The hot dog itself was cooked well and had a nice snap to it.  Despite this, the toppings seemed to overpower the hot dog.  It was just a little too much and I could barely taste the actual dog.  I would like to come back.  The menu has a lot of options so hopefully I just need to try something else.",

The inside of the restaurant has an industrial feel with functioning garage doors in the bar area and exposed duct work, yet clean and whitewashed.  For our tasting we were served a regular hot dog with some type of satay sauce, poutine and a dressed side salad with cranberries and walnuts.  The hot dog had a nice snap to it and the satay tasted decently with it although it would not have been my personal choice.  The poutine was the classic with a beef gravy and cheese curds and while it tasted decently, I have had better.  Finally the salad may have been the best part of the meal as it was dressed with a sour vinaigrette that worked well with the sweet cranberries and savory nuts.  The bottom line for is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I sometimes have a hard time paying as much for hot dogs as they cost here, they are pretty good and I love their new space.",

She let us know that instead of making us stand with a buzzer, they simply send you a text message on your phone! This is such a great concept, and gave us the ability to walk around outside while we waited for our table!  We started out with the Poutine Quebecoise and a Curd Kebab. Their cheese curds are to die for! We ordered the garlic ailoi dipping sauce for our fried curds and could not have been more pleased! My husband ordered the Texan style hot dog (per the hostess' suggestion!) and I ordered the Pittsburgh style hot dog as I have an affinity for a good pierogi... and it did not disappoint!!

There is nothing I love more than having more than 3 options to chose from on a menu. Nearly everything Franktuary offers can be made either vegan or vegetarian. (Hot dogs, sausage, chili, bacon...you name it!) On our most recent visit, we had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and being served by Jake. Jake was extremely knowledgeable about not just the beverage side of things, but also the food offerings. He picked out my husbands entire meal (on request) and made the perfect choices for him! I had a \"Larryville mule\" which was perfection, while my husband stuck to the beer menu. While the vegan sausage is not my style, I absolutely love the tofu dogs. I have it with several different toppings, as well as in corn dog form, and I've loved them every time. Do I even need to mention the variety of dipping sauces?! It's clear that Franktuary cares about using the highest quality, local ingredients and I really appreciate that! I would highly recommend you stop by if you haven't already. (Or, take on the food truck!!)",

    "text": "Does any food pair better with a nice, cold beer more than a hot dog? Maybe pizza but I doubt it. I used to shuffle myself down to the Oliver street location in a church (get it, Franktuary) when I was a tiny little college girl looking for a good wiener. Now it is 10 years later and with the new Market Square location opening soon, I feel it is appropriate to finally discuss my decade long romance with Franktuary. It's consistent, fresh and simple food that everyone should be able to appreciate. While I get myself a chili cheese dog more times than not, I recently stepped out of the box to try something different and ordered the Portland dog. It had cream cheese, miller's mustard, pickled onions and crispy capers. I took one bite and died. I am currently writing this review from my tomb, patiently awaiting resurrection so that I can eat 50 more. For starters, pickled onions and cream cheese should pretty much be on everything. More importantly, if there is a better thing to do with a caper berry than fry it, I don't care to know. I would fist fight someone over fried capers because they are that good. Why bars do not have bowls of these to munch on, as opposed to boring nuts, I will never know. I thought I was a one hot dog kind of girl. Turns out I was living a lie this entire time.",

    "text": "I visited this shop during restaurant week because of the special they had. 2 hot dogs any style, 2 boylan sodas and a poutine to share all for $20.13. When we first walked in, the inside was spacious and well lit with seating for plenty. They had the garage style window up to let in fresh air and extra light. It was a seat your-self establishment so we had alot of tables to choose from. It was about 2pm on a friday but there were very few people inside, maybe 10-12. The seats are like church pews along with hard wood tables, thus the name franktuary.  The manager greeted us with a smile an offered us any seat we would like. We chose to sit closest to the kitchen which wasn't a bad choice because the noise level was really low. The pew/bench which is nailed to the floor sat very far from the table making it almost uncomfortable to sit. My fiance was on the other end so he offered to sit next to me so we could pull the table closer to us. Our waitress came to offer us drinks, I chose the cream soda and he chose the lemon-lime soda. They were all natural and delicious with fresh flavor. After looking over the menu we decided on the pittsburgh dog which had mushed pierogi and cole slaw on it. i went with sauerkraut instead of the slaw. my fiance chose the chicago style which is a classic dog of course. For our poutine we ordered the texas which came with beef chili, chedder cheese and jalapenos.   The poutine was definitely my favorite over the hot dogs. My pierogi was cold and the dog i order which was their new zealand underdog was very tough and dry. the toppings made it had to swallow because their was very little moisture. I found myself drinking soda after every bite. The poutine on the other hand was very tasty and hot. The fries had become a little soggy from the chili but i enjoyed them this way. We both decided on a beer but they only had about 10 drafts to choose from. Although their was a full bar and a make-your-own cocktail menu i would have preferred more beers.   After halfway finishing my food my now fiance had surprised me with an engagement ring and a banner reading \"will you marry me?\" I was definitely overcome with joy but sad that he had chosen a place that we had never been to before. There is a chance i may return to franktuary but just for the poutine and a drink.",

    "text": "We went here prior to a Yelp event at Kiln-N-Time (right up the road on 38th Street, check it out!) and boy we were glad we did!  It was a Wednesday night, around 6PM, and we walked right in getting a cute high top in the front of the restaurant.  They have a garage door, and tonight being a beautiful night, it was wide open encouraging some good people watching on Butler Street!  You pick your base hot dog (standard, grass fed, veggie, etc.) and then you can customize toppings or pick a suggested hot dog with specific toppings.  I tried the Reyjavnik hot dog and found it to be pretty tasty.  This hot dog had mustard, remoulade, ketchup, onion and crispy onions on it.  My boyfriend had the Oahu, and I gotta admit it, but I liked his even better than mine.  The house bacon, teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple and scallions combination was so delightful with a sweetness but savory quality.  This would be a hard one not to get next time!!  There are so many options though, there will be certainly one for any palate!  The beer selection was small to moderate, but chock full of good options including craft beers.  I tried the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout and found it to be absolutely delicious!  I would definitely get this one again.  The decor is cool.  They have reused pews as the booths. (Get it?  It's like a sanctuary...but a Franktuary!!)  As a lifelong hot dog fanatic, I can't wait to come back to this place over and over again!",

The environment is fantastic... there are tons of bar seats, including some prime spots that look straight out the windows and into the street, and the cocktails are really well done -- in fact, I think Franktuary serves up the second best cocktails in mid/lower Lawrenceville, second only to Tender.  For the bar of a hot dog joint, that's impressive!!  My favorite one for a sunny day is the doubting Tom Collins... so refreshing and balanced.  The lime in this makes it better than regular Tom Collinses!  Looking for a great bang for your buck?  Get the church wine punch.  Port, lemon, scotch, honey, and cloves?  Talk about throwing a bunch of my favorite things in a punch bowl!  And, yes, it is as tasty as it sounds.  The food is kind of hit-or-miss here.  I love the grass-fed beef meatballs, though they are definitely on the pricey side (just have them during happy hour -- the meatballs are discounted to $2 each!).  But what do you expect... they are grass-fed, and organic!  The beef hot dogs are also very tasty, but I was much less impressed by the salmon and vegan ones.  Perhaps people who don't actually eat meat, or beef, would find them more palatable, but I will never be ordering those again!  I also think the garbanzo fries, while a cool concept, are a bit bland.  They come with sauces, but they are thick and have a thick, complex texture, so the sauces only go so far in flavoring.  The service, though, is outstanding!  All the bartenders here are great, but I was particularly impressed by Roger, who put up with a lot of nonsense from my friends and me one night when Franktuary was our last stop and we'd had a lot to drink already.  He was super accommodating and nice to us and even gifted me a lemon because I was out of them and wanted to make bloody marys the next morning. The staff are all super nice to my dog when I bring her and she hangs out on the sidewalk outside the open garage-door window.  They bring her water and pet her.  Obviously Franktuary has a great team of staff, and in large part because of that, this continues to be my lower lawrenceville go-to spot for an anytime drink.",

I was underwhelmed, but a friend insisted on going last week and I am glad I gave Franktuary another chance!  It was a week night, the place was busy, but we were able to be seated without a wait, and there was plenty of wait staff available who were all friendly, fast, and attentive.  Their signature dogs were as inventive and premium as ever, and this time everything came out very fresh including crispy indulgent Poutine fries.  The prices were certainly higher than your average dog and fries, but you absolutely get more than you pay for.  Based on my first experience, I'd still be a bit nervous coming here at a peak busy time like Saturday night, but any other time, I'd be thrilled to spend some bank with Frank!",

The service was awesome... she made the best of what was not 86ed and made recommendations and was super pleasant and fast given how busy they were.    I am a basic dog person, so nothing I had was going to knock it out of the park so to speak, but my husband said his were good.  His buddies veggie sausage item was apparently awesome.  The boring fries were good (with sea salt) BUT they were tiny... almost bite size (so I am guessing we were getting what was the remnants of larger fries that went to other people from the batch).    We will go back and try everything that they were out of sometime.  Hopefully next time they will have what we really want :)  The meatballs in particular.",

The veggie dog was made to be like a real hot dog - it was made of soy and not mashed up vegetables, which I kind of was not expecting. The whole concept of a sit-down hot dog restaurant is weird, but it is cheap and good so I am not complaining.

Based on the food alone I would go back. It was quite expensive and we even went during happy hour. I can't imagine paying 60 dollars for some hotdogs and 2 drinks each but that is what we did. My main concern was the service. I have worked as a bartender for quite some time before my current career and all I can say is \"ugh\". My husband and I both had to ask for another drink while the bartender played on her phone and stood around and talked to other employees including what I believe was the manager. We both sat with our drinks empty for a good 5 minutes. The worst part was that we were the only 2 people at the bar! During our wait for drinks the bartender's friend walked in... She trotted right past us to serve him and we were left  thirsty while she chatted him up for a few minutes. Overall I would try again but it's disappointing that the service was so very lacking even with a manager right there.",

As I've said before the presentation of the hot dogs needs work. The buns are bland and overpower the hot dog and the ingredients.

    "text": "I've been to this place a couple of times since it's opened.  The first couple of times were just great.  The food was good, there was a fun draft selection and the servers were splendid.  Then we came here on a busy Friday night and all went downhill.  We sat at the last two seats at the bar.  We got drinks in a reasonable amount of time however we waited an obscene amount of time for food.  As a former waitress it really takes a lot for me to flag someone down but I eventually got a waitress to check on our food and she brought it out immediately.  We were probably waiting upwards of an hour and half for four hotdogs.  When we got our food my veggie dogs were cold, not lukewarm but cold.  I've never sent food back at a restaurant but these were not suited for human consumption.  I had my husband try it too and he confirmed I didn't have a choice but to send them back.  After about 15 minutes the bartender came over and asked how things were and I confessed my hotdogs were cold and requested that they just throw them in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  The bartender was ridiculously nice about it all and apologized profusely.  About 25 minutes later replacement veggie dogs were brought to me and they were totally fine.  Mind you I was pretty drunk by this point because I'd been sitting at a bar for about 2 hours and had planned to eat about an hour and 15 minutes ago so that was also pretty annoying to me.  Ohhh and I nearly forget, my husband ordered poutine that never came.  Thankfully we weren't charged for the poutine or the two veggie dogs that had to go back.  I can't really figure out what the problem here is.  The staff is great and seem to be totally competent but the food service is a problem.  Maybe they have a bad kitchen staff?  Whatever the reason we're done with this place.  I wish them well and would recommend it to others but after this one bad experience I have no interest in returning.  There are too many other restaurants in the area that I like to spend any more money here.",

There were 2 customers at the bar. 3 employees behind the bar. I waited several minutes for the bartender to finish his personal conversation. After finally being greeted, he then gave me a draft list after I had to ask for it. I ordered quickly and waited several more mins for him to pour my drink. In the meantime I watched him touch his hair multiple times, then touch his face. Then only to touch my glass several times to keep topping it off. Never once stopping to wash his hands. I am a bartender myself. I have never yelped anyone. I was okay with having to wait 20 mins for my friends and I to get 3 drinks. But I was not okay with the constant touching of the face and hair. Seriously that is a major no no and quite disgusting. I did not pay $9 a drink for a side of his sweat and body oils. I sincerely hope the management sees this review and addresses the issue.",

It is rare situation to go to a restaurant with a group of mixed friends- and by mixed I mean meat eaters and veggies :) - and for all parties be happy with the quality of the food. I didn't realize that this place was so vegetarian friendly until I went out on a Friday night with some coworkers. The place was so awesomely designed that it feels upscale but also laid back at the same time. The people who work there know their stuff and are great at making suggestions- and I ended up getting the veggie sausage and chili- and everything was scrumptious. Coupled with a good beer selection and a few great whiskeys on the menu, this is a great place to get your booze and food on. The one not-so-good surprise for me was that the place was actually pretty quiet.... on a Friday night.  It's quite possible that things get a bit more interesting later in the night, but it did seem that the focus was more on the food and restaurant rather than the bar- which is great- however the next time I go I'd like to go a little later to make sure to be there when the action happens.",

I wanted this place to be great and was excited to be there but as soon as we walked in the waitress who sat us made us feel very unwelcome and all around uncomfortable. She seemed very zoned out and not interested in the least bit in even pretending to give a shit about us. The other waiters and waitresses seemed great but I guess we got stuck with the bad one. I don't know who had the idea to stick this rude woman in a customer facing position but they need to retrain her or stick her in the back. Completely ruined the experience for me and our table of six making none of us even remotely interested in ever returning. I've worked in customer service positions for ten years and understand people have bad days and have never left a review before but I just felt I had to warn people about this, especially if you're going to be spending a decent amount of money on hot dogs and still have to tip your zombie waitress.",

There is nothing special about the hotdogs. Mine was not even hot, on a regular old bun. At least have big juicy hotdogs with unbelievable buns or something that makes them worth $4.00 other than being organic.  The fries were very ordinary and the poutine extremely mediocre. I don't know, maybe I set my expectations too high for a hotdog joint. Really disappointing.",

We dined on a Saturday afternoon and were lucky enough to get one of the few parking spaces reserved for the restaurant behind the building.  We were seated in one of the tables and the waitress quickly came to bring water glasses as well as a large bottle of tap to refill our glasses - always a plus in our book.  We ordered hot dogs and poutine and were pleased with our orders.  I decided to try a Pittsburgh dog as well as a Bangkok dog while my husband ordered a Texan and a Southern Belle.  The dogs themselves were good with a good snap on the skins, the potato buns were soft and tasty, and the toppings were fresh, creative, and really tasty.  Unfortunately, the gravy wasn't yet ready for our poutine Quebecois so the waitress suggested we order the Buffalo poutine instead which was really delicious.  The Boylan soda on tap is another unexpected treat!  We really enjoyed our visit to Franktuary and are likely to visit again!",

Two days ago my run on hot dogs led to the salmon dog with Pennsylvania Dutch Apple/Onion \"chutney\" and Sharp Cheddar Cheese. It was hard to just eat one. But the cold glass of Yard's Love Stout that tastes like a combo of chocolate and coffee helped fill me and cool my jets so I could leave satisfied and not stuffed. Really nice wait staff, bartender, and it was fun to talk to the  crafter of the custom-made dogs as he prepared the dogs in the open kitchen.",

I had the kielbasa which was very good and made it my own with cheese, mustard, and onions. I also had one of the local brews on tap which was lightly peach tasting and refreshing. It was from Atlanta, but I don't remember the brewery or the name. But I think the best thing this place offers is the old fashioned they make. Wowww, it is gooood. They use orange bitters which I think makes it extremely tasty. Overall a decent menu and good drinks! The interior of this place was freezing.

Whenever I find a place that offers Veggie Dogs I can't resist stopping by. I was flying solo in town on business so I was glad to see that Franktuary had a bar that I could sit at (I'm not used to dining alone so bar seating was a plus!). I ordered a Mangorita which was delicious and strong, just the way I like it. I also had the Street Corn Salad, it had good flavor and texture with the cheese, fried tortilla chips, and pickled jalapenos. My only criticism is that the corn wasn't grilled. My server recommended the Chicago Imposter style hot dog which was fantastic. They also had Bingo going on at the tables and bar and everyone playing was having a good time. Nice atmosphere, good service, great food, fair prices, clean bathrooms, nice bar, draft beer selection, family friendly, I would definitely recommend this spot.",

I'm really excited to find uncured turkey dogs on the menu for the kids! Very exciting!  I'm so glad to be able to have soy free & pork free choices for my kids. The poultry choice is excellent.    On the other hand- my sons kids meals- what came out was NOT what I ordered him. Uh. It was a turkey dog just not styled how it was ordered. So be it. It was late. He was really hungry and tired. And who cares if his hot dog wasn't shaped like a sea creature or something. I don't know but, it definitely wasn't what I ordered him.  He's a toddler so he doesn't really know that his meal was messed up.  The waitress brought out a side of shredded cheese. I cut it up into small pieces. He happily put cheese on everything and ate it. It was all the same to him. I think his meal was also supposed to come with gummies. No sign on them during or after dinner. Not sure why....  oh well. His dinner also came with fries. I had asked for cheese curds & gravy for his fries. He had cheese shreds and chili come out. Close. He was happy with the shreds. And He didn't  know it wasn't what was ordered and wasn't what he had the last time there with his Canadian uncle. So he happily ate the cheese shreds with the fries. Eh, he was hungry and he ate it happily. So. Whatever. He liked it. I can't say I was impressed with our service but the kiddo was pleased.   As for my \"meal\".  I ordered a turkey dog with cheese with a glass of wine. Along with fries.  The wine I was served was bad as in it had turned. I had to let the server know.  Gross.  Not our best dining experience but better than our last at Franktuary. We'll be back.  It seems to be improving.",

Always friendly, courteous, quick,  clean, and delicious. As a Vegan it's tough to find many good options around the city at times. That being said the Vegan sausage is excellent! Always well cooked and great with their amazing Veg. chili. The tofu dog on the other hand isn't as good, but being a tofu dog it's about what if expect and is still something I get often, particularly with the very tasty Bangkok style toppings. The fries have always been fresh, and have been cooked and seasoned really well. My only issue with is around the cost. A Vegan bun is a $1 up charge, so after a $6.75 V. Sausage with .75 cent V. Chili you're looking at over $8 just for one. I can't say it's terribly priced but for a grown man who typically puts down two of these with fries and maybe a beer you're looking at a decent bill for dinner. Still with the good and the so so, I still very much love this business and highly recommend it.  Oh and as for their meat options, I've taken many clients, family, and friends here and I've heard nothing but good things. Go check this place out for sure!",

    "text": "I feel like there are a lot of hotdogs haters out there, and I just want to speak up for the downtrodden franks. Also, I mean, the name is a fantastic pun and they get bonus points for that.   I've been to Franktuary for lunch, dinner, brunch, and drinks, and have always had a great experience. I can't recommend just one dog off the menu, since every time I try one, I declare it my new favorite. My top recommendations are: Pittsburgh, Memphis, and Chicago Impostor.    I know people complain about the pricey wieners, but keep in mind, these are all beef franks, and you also have the option for locally sourced meats. Sure, it's not a $1 cart dog on the street, but I don't think it ever claimed it was.   When I go to brunch, I can't help but order whatever brunch poutine they have cooked up. That choice has ever done me wrong--but I find the regular poutine's gravy a bit too salty and steer clear of that as a dinner option.   This place is great to bring just about anyone. Foodies love it, my Mom loves it, my vegan cousin tolerates it, and I regularly meet for after work drinks there (great food specials during happy hour 4-6). The staff is always friendly, and the events they hold always look fun (must get to a crossword night soon!)  I hope I've set the haters straight, if you love a hotdog, or even just have lukewarm feelings towards the thing--you're gonna love it here.",

They advertised on my campus radio station and I still think of that jingle sometimes, randomly!   I had brunch today with my family, and of course, loved it. I had the hot dog special and my husband had the farmers poutine. Both were incredible!   Also, the place is great for kids. Our 16-month old son was given a coloring page and crayons and all of the servers told us how sweet he was. I always appreciate when we don't feel out of place at a restaurant when we bring him.",

From $2 picnic dogs, to street dogs, to fancy-pants dogs ... love them all. Franktuary has great dogs a lot of fun specialty topping combos -or- you can just go classic. For the great quality of ingredients (and location), their prices are super fair.     I've been there twice for brunch now and also had great meals paired with great service. I most recently stopped in on a Sunday afternoon (absolutely zero wait) around 1pm. Despite being towards the end of a brunch shift (not an easy shift - I'm sure anyone who works service industry understands the nightmare disguised as \"brunch\") and the staff members were all still super pleasant. They had a really cool Olympics theme going on with the menu. Super fun touch I think. My partner and I split the USA and Israel specials (bacon/egg sandwich on a bloody mary and falafel dish, respectively). Both were awesome. The shining star of brunch was our server, Delaney. She truly made the meal enjoyable, relaxed, and didn't hesitate to share a laugh with us and put up with our indecisiveness.",

Decided to give Frantuary's brunch a try on an Olympic Hockey Sunday and was thrilled to find out they opened early (730am) with free donuts and coffee for the hockey game.  After noshing on some quite delectable cinnamon rolls and joe, we asked for some brunch menus at 10am and dived in.  Build-your-own poutine for the wife, breakfast sandwich for the brother and breakfast flat bread for me.  While my flat bread was decent, the poutine and breakfast sandwich were better.  I recommend her combination of sweet potatoes, sausage and red-eye gravy for a unique combo!  I know this is a frank spot, but I actually prefer their non-frank options!  I cannot count the amount of times one of the owners came up and asked how we were doing, which is another plus...  extremely friendly and down to earth people.  For the oddest reason I found myself completely relaxed and in the moment here, which is rare nowadays.  Definitely a plus in my book!",

I stand corrected.  I ordered the grass-fed beef dog Pittsburgh style.  It sounds gross...slaw, pierogis, and ranch dressing with a hog dog on a potato bun.  What possessed me to order it, I do not know.   But it was awesome.  The dog was perfect on a perfect potato bun...and the toppings worked.   Total surprise.   I followed that up with a little dessert - some sort of apple caramel thing the size of a cupcake with fresh whipped cream.  It was the perfect amount of food and was delicious.  The dog came to $5.50 with another $3 for the dessert.  That was enough honestly, but I might throw in a side of fries next time just because they looked good.    Why only four stars?   Two things.   I ordered a salad, which was pretty lackluster and skimpy.   A couple small dots of goat cheese and some tiny bits of stone fruit with a mound of lettuce.  Not at all worth the $8 and not what I pictured reading the description.   The other thing was the bar.  I was in a Captain and Coke kind of mood.   They didn't have Captain.   OK...not every bar carries it.  I'll live with Sailor Jerry.   The kicker at the bar though was the SLOOOOOOOOW service.  Drinks took forever to get to the table.  I ordered a refill at the beginning of the meal and got it after we'd all finished everything.  My companions then decided that they'd have a round to go with my drink, which I finished before their drinks arrived.  I wanted another, but we'd have gone on like that all night.",

As far as the execution, I think it is done pretty well. They have a lot of good options. The food is generally good.  The alcohol is a bit expensive, and in general expect to pay a lot here and not get a filling meal. I wish they made it a little more \"gourmet\" for the price they charge. I also wish they had a little bit more finely tuned recipes for the hot dogs -- you can create a custom one, but I usually trust the restaurant to have the best ideas for specialty dogs, which they don't really.  The decor is nice, and kind of funny, but they should definitely be a little more forward with the theme. It's church-themed, get it? It's hard to remember that when you're in the restaurant. I guess maybe they don't want to offend people but I just wish they were a little more forward with it, to be honest. Could be funny.",

I have been here a few times now for a nosh. 1st time with a tour group, 2nd time with my husband (pre contest) on a Friday night and most recently this past Sunday for brunch...but I didn't know about this brunch phenomenon where the menu's are killed down in PGH....sorry, I'm Canadian.   SO. It took us several attempts at trying to piece together something to eat as I was in starvation mode and could not leave without food. The waiter was SUPER helpful and sweet and great but damnit, the menu is NOT good for vegans for brunch, period.   I know there are veggie franks but paying $8 USD for a Field Roast hot dog on a dry bun is kind of a punch in the junk considering a 5 pack of them is less than $8 at retailers.   I guess they are generally more expensive to produce but, woah, hello margin!  Also, the veggie \"bacon\" should take a hike. Its plain pan fried tofu with nothing added and was probably the most frustrating part of the whole experience. The accompanying salad was about 2/3 of a cup in size and felt bad for me as I ate it.   I dunno. I'm not sure if it's just me or this place but for the cost and limited menu (for vegans) I don't think I\"ll be back. Unless I have an extreme pig out night in the future where I can eat junk food to my hearts content and don't mind paying 3 times more than it's worth for the privelidge.",

I only just visited this place for the first time last week and I'm hooked.  In the two visits, I have had three of their unique dogs.  And all I can say is \"OH MY GOD!\"  They are so good and so worth it.  Each hot dog can be customized several different ways to your liking from the type of dog you get, to the bun it's on.  The three dogs I tried were the Pittsburgh, Memphis and Mexican.  All unique in their own sense and all righteously delicious.  The Pittsburgh features a smashed pirogi and cole slaw.  The Memphis features BBQ sauce and potato sticks.  The Mexican features fresca salsa, fresco queso and guacamole.  Each mixes the different flavors perfectly.  And each satisfies just as perfectly.  Each time I had a dog I also ordered the pomme frites with a different dipping sauce, I highly suggest you try the garlic aoili.  The beer selection changes depending on what's in season.  And the selection must be a great when I was in, each time my first option was always gone.  The warmer months allows for the air to flow through here.  The front has garage doors like opening that not only allows the air in, but the noise out.  This also makes for a good time as you can people watch.  Tuesday nights are a great night to stop in here.  Take in a game of \"full contact trivia\" while chowing down on some great food.  Winning gets you either $50 off your tab or a round of free hot dogs for your table.",

I ordered the Reykjavik and the mini baked poutine. The dog came with a remoulade, ketchup, mustard, onion, and fried onions. If I was going to suggest anything, I would recommend holding the mustard. I think the remoulade was overshadowed by the mustard. The poutine was AMAZING. Fries, sharp cheddar, scallions, jalapenos, sour cream, and house bacon. Oh, the bacon. This was the coup d'etat. It was smoked and thick-sliced. It was a delight.   Really fun lunch here, and I'd like to return to try some of their other creations, especially those with kimchi.",

    "text": "I've visited Franktuary's food truck and restaurant, and been very pleased both times. The vegetarian hot dogs are great, although I highly recommend getting plenty of toppings - I don't know that they'd stand up to just ketchup. The topping creations are always interesting and delicious. In terms of price, I think they are pretty reasonable. The only menu item I wish they'd add? Vegetarian poutine! Come on, Franktuary, I want me some cheese curds.  Happy hour is also great - I am a fan of $4 drafts. Just wish I could get in on that 1/2 off poutine.  Edit: I have been informed (on a comment to this review) that the gravy is vegetarian! So, I went back and tried it out, and it was delicious, rich, mushroomy and creamy. So happy I finally got to satisfy my need for poutine!",

Being Gluten-Free I always am thrilled to find a place that accommodates me, not makes me accommodate them. They had plenty gluten-free options, including beer and hot dog bun! The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars was the service. Our waitress forgot about us and we were her only table, we only knew she forgot because after waiting 10 minutes for her to take our drink order she came over and said \"I totally forgot about having a table, it's hard when it's slow.\" Otherwise the food and atmosphere was very hip!",

Just looking at the cocktail menu got me excited for what's to come... too bad it was a lunch time meal.  But really, not that bad because my lunch was suburb. It's restaurant week, so the deal was two meatball subs and poutine to share for $20.13. Not bad at all. I am a sucker for a potato bun, so I was excited to see it beautifully presented on one. The meatballs were large and in charge and there was a tasty blanket of mozz cheese laid out on top. You can get either gravy or marinara and I, of course being Italian, went with the red. I wish there was a tad more sauce on the sub, but I'm a saucy kind a gal...  The poutine was not a let down in the taste department either. Loads of gravy, crispy fries and... cheesecurds. Cheesecurds are made straight from heaven, I swear. I only wish there were more!   The place itself is beautiful. Of course, there are church pews as seats, but no confessions needed. Unless you confess how awesome this place is!",

I got a standard frank Buffalo style with blue cheese dressing, wing sauce, and celery. I felt the dressing and sauce were a bit heavy handed and I really couldn't get a feel for the dog. I think next time I'll keep it simple with a standard frank, or local sausage with mustard and Heinz.   Shared the baked potato poutine with my lunch mate and easily could have eaten it all up on my own. Granted, I was 8 months pregnant at the time of our visit so my appetite has been off the charts as of late. However, even if I wasn't prego one dog would certainly not be enough for a meal. A great snack--yes, but for lunch, and especially dinner, two dogs or a dog and one's own poutine serving, or side of something is in order.   Would definitely like to try this place again and get my libations game on once after this baby arrives.",

Standard dogs typically come out room temperature which is unfortunate as they lose some of the crisp. Their version of the Hawaii dog, the \"Oahu\" is decent, but the teriyaki doesn't match well with the smoked bacon. Their rolls were a little stiff and not effectively grilled.  Fries pale in comparison to some local counterparts and their homemade ketchup, albeit cold and refreshing, just tastes like canned tomato to me. I'm a Heinz kinda guy.  Prices are reasonable and service is always fine, and indefinitely want to try their brunch.  Worth a quick lunch but could use some improvement on the basics.",

The hostess sat us very quickly and then we sat at the table for 5 minutes before being waited on. Our server ,Tristan, had an attitude from the get go. You could tell it was the last place he wanted to be. We Ordered our drinks, coffee and mimosas, and our food at the same time. It took a good while for the coffee to come out and then our food came 2 seconds later while we were still waiting on the mimosas. I said something to him and he had an attitude and said bar was backed up (which I understand having waited tables all through undergrad myself) but then magically 2 seconds later they were there. If he would've said he forgot i wouldn't have minded. The rest of the meal he checked on us once and continued with the attitude. When we're finished eating, he asked about the check and not if we wanted anything else. I was going to get another beverage but I guess not. We paid and he once again said goodbye with an attitude. Food is great so I will eat food from here but probably only get it Togo because this was ridiculous!",

Her answer \"I can only give you a hotdog.\"  I turned and began walking away.  Sarah stops me at the door.  What does she do?  She shows me the order and insists my coworker told her wrong.  I tell her \" I'm a regular there, good customer service would of been replacing the entire order and I won't be returning.\"  She then says \"I can reheat your old fries.\"  SERIOUSLY?  No thanks.

    "text": "We had two amazing items:  the beetball sandwich and salmon dog.  They were very unique and wonderful.  We topped them off with a few local microbrews.  The rest of the menu looked interesting as well.  The only complaint was that they had the window doors open to celebrate a warmer, sunny day after such a hard winter, but it really wasn't warm enough for that and I was very cold!  Not a big deal and we are looking forward to trying this place again!",

    "text": "The food at Franktuary is good.  They offer creative options for a hotdog, but don't go here expecting good service. We went here on a Wednesday and half the tables were empty. After placing our order, we waited 35 minutes to get two hotdogs.  During that time the waiter never bothered to stop to refill drinks or let us know the status of our order.  I don't believe I will be heading back to Franktuary anytime soon.",

    "text": "I went here last night with a friend.  The decor is okay and it wasn't too crowded which was nice.  My main complaint with this place is it is way too expensive.  The cocktail list is the same price as somewhere upscale like Salt - the cheapest was $9.  I don't really think of expensive cocktails as really going with hot dogs and pierogies but okay.   My friend got Arsenal Cider though and they charged $7.50 for a glass.  You can refill your growler up the street for like $14...I thought that was kind of insane.  The positive is the vegetarian options.  They have Field Roast Sausages which are the best faux meat product around - far superior to the veggie dogs that they serve at Station Street.  I got it New York style which wasn't my favorite - wish I had something else.  We got the poutine to split which was okay, but I don't think it was spectacular.    One Big Hop, a veggie sausage, and poutine to split ran me $16.11.  I might go back here, but I'd probably suggest getting guac and cheaper drinks at Round Corner instead.",

    "text": "Recently came for brunch and had a great time. The menu is limited - there were 4 main dishes, and it seems that an a la carte option of eggs, toast, bacon, etc could be put together. In the end, it was something of a relief to have just a few options in today's standard of so many choices.  (Though it was great that the dishes could be made with meatless proteins as well). We had the breakfast poutine, the stuffed grape leaves omelette, and crepes. Side salads with locally foraged greens, including edible flowers, took the meal to another level. Everyone enjoyed their selections, and mimosas and kombucha added a little extra kick. A little pricey to be a regular option for me (while still being a good value), but it was a fun thing to treat my folks to.",
