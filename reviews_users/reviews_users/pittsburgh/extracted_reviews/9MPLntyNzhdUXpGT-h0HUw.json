    "text": "In town for work. Asked the hotel if they had any recommendations for dinner and they recommended Walnut Street for dining and shopping. I went on Yelp and found this gem. The decor is modern and sleek - very classy, warm, and welcoming. The menu is amazing and so different. I got the \"Down the Rabbit Hole\" cocktail - reposado, horchata, and cardamom. I love trying new tequila drinks so I was very pleased. The waitress was so sweet and knowledgeable and recommended so many things I decided to try a few small plates to get to try several things. I tried the salt cod, chestnut ravioli, and veal sausage. After the salt cod, I was satisfied and could have had only that for my meal, but I'm glad I tried so many delicious things. Based on these, I'm sure the whole menu is incredible and if back in the area I would absolutely come back. The waitress told me this place is only about three months old, so I want to highly recommend it and I hope this restaurant is vey successful! I also overheard the bartender tell some diners that their charcuterie is cured in house which is also awesome.   I only have two suggestions - first, I was looking for an early dinner and one of the tipping points for my choosing to come here was that they opened (according to yelp) at 4:30 PM. When hotel shuttle dropped me off, I noticed they don't open til 5. It's snowing out so I had to wander around for a half hour. Luckily, there's lots of shops in the area. And it was WELL worth the wait. But that should be noted.  My second suggestion is to add a larger sign. The shuttle and I were looking for it and it was difficult to find. This storefront is not well labeled (neither the address number nor the name) unless you are walking right up to it. Other than these two items, it was a flawless experience. The staff was friendly and welcoming and all the other customers seemed to have incredible experiences as well.",

    "text": "For many years, I have found the restaurants on (and near) Walnut to be somewhat disappointing. Some are just plain bad, but even the ones that serve good food tend to be conventional and perhaps play it \"too safe.\"  Happily Acorn is an exception.  I sampled the pork belly and the fiddlehead fern -- both small plates, but the portions are sufficient for a light dinner. The pork belly dish presents a good balance of taste and texture. The date brings out the sweetness; the crunchy pickled veggies serve as a counter point to the luscious fatty meat. The fiddlehead dish is served shakshuka style, in a cast iron pan. It was very satisfying, with the egg yoke still soft and runny, and the salsa verde offering a mild hint of heat; I'm not usually a huge dill fan, but here, the herb is used judiciously and is not overwhelming; it harmonizes the entire dish well. I also tried the shortcake dessert, expecting a conventional mess of strawberries and cream over biscuits. Happily, Acorn offers a more sophisticated rendition, with Italian merengue, goat cheese ice cream, caramelized peaches, and some freeze-dried strawberry accents. It avoids all the usual pitfalls of a bad strawberry shortcake: it is not cloyingly sweet -- there seems to be some salt in either the crushed nuts or in the ice cream (almost a little too much); it is not too dry; and it's not one-dimensional.   The service was fine. I showed up to dinner alone and without reservation. They seated me right away at a high top by the window; the servers were attentive and did not rush me.  I do think there is a bit of an incongruity about this restaurant --  the vibe of the place is more of a casual bar and grill, like other nearby establishments, but the food and the price is more upscaled. If I just wanted to grab a quick bite to eat while taking a break from shopping, this place would not fit the bill; but then, there are already lots of other outlets for that kind of dining. I'm glad that an inventive restaurant like Acorn has joined the Walnut St. neighborhood.",

    "text": "Service was excellent and everyone was super welcoming.  Our server was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu going out of her way to explain vegetarian options for my wife.   The menu is rather small, but has a decent selection of vegetarian options and varied starters.  The main course options are very limited unless your are able to share with a larger group.  Half of the options are recommended for 2-4 people sharing.  Something to consider for a couple with different palates.    The cocktails were tasty and well thought out.  The $14 glass of cab was pretty average.  Perhaps it had been opened the day before and was not sealed well.  Lacked depth and was a bit hot, but not bad enough to send it back.    We shared a beat salad which was nice and had a mix of textures and flavor profiles.  My wife enjoyed her mushroom pasta.  My lamb dish was below average.  Lamb was served 3 ways but the star of the dish was a tough and over cooked tenderloin.  I could not consume 1/4 of it due to tendon and connective tissue and even had a small bone it.  Overall it was just a middle eastern spiced mess of lamb.    I would give 3.5 if available, but the lamb dish and limited selections don't warrant 4 stars.",

We did wine although they gave a very nice bar and interesting cocktails. We started with the crab \"rice\", which had no rice and is finished with a soft duck egg. Delicious!  The salt cod brandade was also excellent and the marinated tomorrow's with salmon flake and dill was fresh and bright and sweet and a preparation I never had before. My husband got the Timballo which is layered crepes and cheese finished with grilled octopus and romaine. I had the chicken fried rabbit which included the tenderloin perfectly cooked as well as a crispy fried legs and thighs. No room for dessert but they sounded great and we will definitely be back again and save room.",

But omg THE FOOD.  I almost don't know what to say.  I've been here a few times now, have always tried something different, and it's always knocked my socks off.  I think oysters are gross... but not anymore.  I rarely eat meat... but the strip is insane.  Calamari is scary... nope.  I appreciate that things are not always as they seem, and I like to be surprised -- this menu does a fabulous job of being both a little inscrutable and totally familiar all at once.  Totally love the shareables, and think the broccoli tartine in particular is delicious.  The salads (tomato & cucumber, I think?  and a great one with radishes) were unusual and ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.    Dining here is an experience, and one I don't mind paying for.  Worth it to me.

We ordered the Lamb and the Rigatoni and we were impressed by both. The lamb was tender and cooked perfectly. The Rigatoni had home made pasta and had a pickle like flavor which was refreshing and interesting.  We ended with the Lemon desert, and the ice cream was creamy and the pound cake was warm and flavorful. There was no dish where we felt like it was out of place or mediocre. Everything was so good!",

Also there are only 5 reviews, and 2 of them I believe are from the same couple (husband and wife) that significantly lower the yelp rating, so please do not be discouraged to try this new restaurant.   I came here with my fiance a few weeks ago as we saw this recently opened. Our server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. The menu items were unique and interesting. Although some ingredients were unfamiliar to me I am always up for trying and learning new experiences. I believe acorn definitely is set apart from other restaurants by their unique dishes and presentation. The oysters for example is presented on a bed of seaweed and poured steam water tableside to give the aroma of being by the ocean. The lamb was perfectly cook and the lemon dessert had a good balance-was tart but not overtly sweet.   I enjoyed the decor and ambience as well; I did not have any issues with noise as the other reviewers but that may be due to arriving mid day when it was less crowded. I strongly believe acorn is a great addition to the community bc of their unique presentation and also amazing entree, which I have not seen in other restaurants in the area. Although the price is slightly high, it is within reason, and definitely worth the experience. I plan to bring my parents here when they visit bc I know they will also appreciate and enjoy the service and food here at acorn",

    "text": "If your looking for modern american food with nice flavors, stop by and give it a try.  The menu is small and seasonal but has some interesting combinations to allow for fresh and well prepared dishes.  The presentation is part of the experience, too.   There is a list of about a half dozen cocktails and beers along with limited list of wines.   I started with the Gougeres which is chicken liver mouse that comes with some tiny radish, gherkins, onions, and pickle califlower.  A wonderful presentation and very tasty starter.  For my larger plate I had the Rigatoni with has squash sofrito, anchovy, lemon, stravecchio.  The homemade pasta was perfectly cooked and the flavors of the stravecchio cheese and squash were very tasty.   Service was very good and every dish was described by the staff.   For a new recently opened restaurant, everything was well done. Welcome to the neighborhood!",

I had the BBQ beets and the Rainbow Trout.  My friend had the Dry Aged Duck and the celeriac tar tar.   So delicious! We were stuffed but couldn't resist the deconstructed carrot cake. I had it on my first visit and couldn't pass it up.  One of the best desserts I've ever had and I'm not a dessert person.  The Chef stopped by our table and even sent over a complimentary Fernet Branca!  Our cancelled flight was a great excuse to revisit one of my favorite restaurants.",

Food, however, was in some cases so heavily spiced as to totally mask the main components. Two of us had the mahi that disappeared under a heavy blanket of seasonings. The pork roast and rainbow trout were nicely done. We started with the gnocchi and charred cauliflower ... both enjoyable ... and ended sharing a plate of beignets, also enjoyable. Even just half filled, the place was a little noisey ... but then what American bistro isn't now adays. May go back. My wife loves the place for lunch.",

I had the salt beets, and the rigatoni (house made!) with a black truffle-nori sauce and lobster mushrooms. I was very impressed. 2. Wonderful service. I brought my aunt and mother, who are very demanding (changing orders, changing tables, etc), and our waitress handled it all beautifully, even rushing a last-minute order of the whole fried chicken.  Less positives:  1. The chairs are super uncomfortable - all four of us were different heights and we all somehow found them difficult to sit in. 2. Not all of the tables are good - the combination of high bar stools and low booths means that many tables have a view of other peoples' butts  3. Because it's farm-to-table, the menu changes often. If you have dietary restrictions (e.g. being vegetarian) you should call them and make sure there will be something for you to eat.  All in all, a nice experience - will be returning!",

I really loved the restaurant's aesthetic, and even though it was fairly busy, it was still easy to chat. Our server was super friendly and knowledgable, and all of the food arrived quickly. We shared an order of beignets, then each got the pancakes. The food was plated beautifully.The beignets were served warm and fluffy, and the dipping sauces (which included a smoked chocolate sauce--I've never seen that on a menu before!) were delicious. Our pancakes left a little more to be desired. They looked like Japanese pancakes but weren't as fluffy as a Japanese pancake typically is, and they were really crumbly. I would have liked more fruit on them, and though they were advertised as being served with walnuts, the walnuts were basically garnish. Nevertheless, other people's meals looked fantastic. Between the fantastic service, beautiful atmosphere, and proximity to Walnut street, this would be a great place to bring guests. I'm excited to try Acorn's dinner!",

    "text": "This was a star-rating struggle for me.  They did have some redeeming qualities, but I didn't love the place and I doubt I would return.   Here's the scoop.    The good:   - The service was excellent.  Everyone was very friendly and the server was knowledgeable.  She described each dish in perfect detail and was formal without being stuffy.    - The place is pretty.  I sat on a bench seat and was comfortable.   - The food LOOKS great.   Top notch presentations on all of the dishes.    - The cocktails we tried were tasty.     The bad:  - Reservation process - they use a website called Tock, which did not work on the three occasions I tried.  I finally had to call.    - Limited menu.  I was totally fine, but if you have a dietary restriction, you have very limited selections.   - The food didn't taste quite as good as it looked.  While the dishes were all very pretty, they all lacked a little something in the flavor department.   - This place is more expensive that it seems. The couple of entrees ($26-$35) we got were very reasonably sized in the protein department, but the sides were just garnishes.  You'd really want to order a small plate in addition to add some balance, bringing the total to $37-$48.  The small plates were small.  The three vegetable options were barely 1/3 cup total and they ranged from $11-$13.  Drinks were also on the pricey side.  I got the pork entree and two glasses of house Pinot Gris and my total was around $75 with tip.  I wasn't hungry when I was done, but I didn't feel like my $75 was well spent either.",

Our server was so convivial and professional. He knew everything in detail about the cocktails, the menu and wine pairings. The service was maybe the best we've had in Pittsburgh in a long time. And that doesn't even begin to describe how amazing the food was.  Three of the four of us had special dietary restrictions which were all easily met with minor adjustments to the dishes we chose. We had the charred cauliflower as a shared appetizer. It had an Indian spice flavor that we all enjoyed. One of us had the lamb kofta as an entree. We also ordered the chicken fried rabbit, the white bass and the trout. All so extraordinarily delicious. We kept passing around the plates because no one could decide which we loved best. Every plate was almost licked clean and if we hadn't been too self conscious I think we may have actually done it! Don't miss this place.   caulflower",

    "text": "I would give Acorn a 4-star for the food but the overall experience in terms of price/value, noise and comfort reduces my rating.  Wine prices by the glass are high (low teens) but that has become a trend here.  But it was the price of the wine bottles that seemed more inflated with very few priced at under $50!  As others have noted, this is a pricey restaurant and the portion size in many cases (particularly the appetizers) was small.  For a party of 3, we ordered two appetizers:  the charred cauliflower ($14) and the root vegetables ($11).  The cauliflower was very tasty, the root vegetable dish was served at room temperature and was just OK.  Both dishes where on the tiny side given the price.  We each had our own entree:  Mushroom Rigatoni ($26), Arctic char ($33), and Rainbow Trout ($28).  The trout dish was a decent size and very good, the Char was undercooked and had a strong mustard sauce as well as raw onions, the pasta dish was certainly tasty but again small in portion with no other sides.   By the end of the meal, I was still moderately hungry.  Given the high price of desserts, we opted to go across the street for gelato instead.  The noise level in terms of music was high and distracting, particularly since the restaurant was not overly crowded on a Tuesday night.  Others have complained about the chairs but were not an issue for me.   Service was good but not great given the price point of this restaurant.    The menu is an interesting one though and for those willing/able to spend over $50 per person, it's certainly worth trying.",

First and foremost, 5 stars for the spicy squash soup -- I think I've only had better soup at a Michelin rated restaurant.  4 stars for the general dining area and bar. In terms of sitting for lunch, can go either way here -- particularly for someone who comes in by themself, but I took a booth which helped me spread out with my computer and respond to some emails. Loss of a star for not having WiFi to connect to. Was fairly disappointed by the burger on their lunch menu, so only 3 stars here. Fries were great and very unique, but the burger tasted way too much like a whopper. Great presentation, but it was also a bit sloppy in terms the cheese/sauce. I couldn't even finish it, which is rare for me. For me, improvement needed on burger, but maybe others like it!  I would definitely come again and thought the service was timely and friendly.  Bar also looked well stocked and wine list fairly lengthy, so I'd enjoy trying that over dinner.",

The shrimp and grits was good, but overall the flavors were not interesting enough to provoke craving for this dish. The pancakes were sweet and good. However, parts of pancakes was a too overcooked.

It's hard to find something new to improve on a tomato salad but they did it. Chatted with the bartender for a while and she was knowledgeable and a great guide to local spirits.

The service we received was professional and everyone was very attentive. I was expecting them to have a full espresso bar for brunch, but they do not.   We tried the Everything Crust - their take on lox and bagels. The homemade bread was warm and delicious!! It was my favorite thing we ordered.

We each had the eggs and potatoes and then shared the pancakes. The eggs and potatoes were pretty standard but the pancakes were AMAZING. If you go, you have to try them. They were decadent little pillows of joy. They are super fluffy as they are probably an inch high and are served with a yummy caramelized sauce, peaches, and cream. I did not even need the extra syrup. They were a nice dessert to our meal. The prices are also very reasonable for brunch! Definitely check it out if you are in Shadyside!",

It is a great addition to the atmosphere. I had the chilaquiles which were phenomenal and paired wonderfully with my mimosa. My friend had the shrimp and grits which were excellent, but she was underwhelmed by the Bloody Mary. Our server was kind and prompt. It may sound crazy, but we both were bothered by how uncomfortable the chairs were! They were angled very strangely and unless you were sitting in a very recliner fashion they cut into your lower back. May seem silly, but it may be the reason we ran out instead of trying another drink. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and can't wait to go back!",

Our first time here was easily the most welcome we've felt in a Pittsburgh restaurant. The owner/chef took time to chat with us which was a real treat. What a quality human! Today's visit was just as delightful (try the chilaquiles or shrimp & grits!).  I've gone to a lot of restaurants in my life and only the finest establishments care enough to do more than put good food in front of you. To get that level of service from a restaurant without white table cloths is definitely my kinda place. Pittsburgh is becoming a really foodie town, but Acorn has set the bar for food & service. Go there immediately, if not sooner.",

For appetizers, we got the shrimp toast and mussels (I can't seem to find this on the online menu anymore). I could not decide which one I liked better. The shrimp toast came with chunky scallops and a piece of octopus which tasted so good. The sauce was so savory and tiny bit sweet, I just wanted to take it home! For entrees we got the Linguine and Salmon. The sauce in salmon I ordered was so good I also wanted to take that home. The Linguine was very rich and the portion was generous. They had bits of pistachios in it which was a good touch.     * Cost vs. Worth: Their dinner prices are the same compared to other restaurants with three money signs. Entrees are around $30 and appetizers are around $15. The food is definitely worth the cost.  Will I come here again? - I definitely want to try their lunch menu next time!",

Our server Nathan was super nice, started to forget about checking in on us towards the end (mainly for water), but he was super kind and was willing to answer any questions that we had on the menu.   ~~ Best Part: THE FOOD. The food actually surprised me becuase there wasn't actually anything that I disliked. The carrots were lacking a little in flavor in comparison to the other foods (but it's most likely intended to be that way).   ~~ Worst Part: Water refills towards the end, but it wasn't THAT big of a deal.   ~~ Tips: Try the whole chicken! The fried 1/2 of the chicken is cooked perfectly and the dips that come with the platter are amazing! But you really can't go wrong with anything on this menu.   ~~ Return: If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, yes!!",

The beignets were excellent. Service was very good, especially help with the unusual menu. Our martinis were fine but the wine list was disappointing. Choices were very limited and prices were high, although it was difficult because the list was limited to unique wines not available in local stores. This obfuscation is intentional and, in my view, disingenuous. Overall the experience was favorable and we would probably return, but the attraction is not strong.",

We visited on a Friday night and quickly found a place to sit.   Our server was charming and knowledgeable. We found several items containing ingredients we'd never heard of before. He explained each dish to us giving his best recommendations along the way. The menu is spit into big and small plates. We ordered the charcuterie board, and two small plates- the gnocchi and the cauliflower. The small plates made the dinner. Both had so much flavor we were blown away. I'd love to stay I'll try something new next time I visit, but honestly I'd love to have both again.   It's the perfect place for dinner or a small plate and a drink. You'll certainly be happy you stopped.",

We had the escargot and carb \"rice\" as appetizers and rainbow trout and dry aged duck as entrees. All dishes were beautifully executed, proteins were perfectly cooked, and the dish presentation was innovative. Also, portion size is larger than I expected, so I'm pretty much full after having the crab \"rice\" appetizer. Although the food here taste great, the dished we ordered were too heavy for me, especially the sauces came with escargot/trout, which overwhelmed other components of the dish. It would be perfect to have some elements on these dishes to balance the greasiness, so I took out one star.  Service is great yet slightly lacking, probably because there weren't many customers that night. Overall, great high-end spot for special occasions. Dinner price is $50+/person.",

As we walked down Walnut Street we saw this HUGE line at Pamela's right across the street. When we walked into Acorn there were a few tables available, live music, and such a great vibe walking in. I cannot believe those people were at Pamela's and not Acorn. For now, it's a hidden gem, but once people realize it's there, good luck getting a spot!!  Ugh we have come back every weekend we are down there, it's is incredible!!!!",

It was hard to decide what to order since everything on the menu looked so good. The bartender was very helpful and went over some of the menu items with us. We ended up ordering 3 small plates and an entree so we could share a bunch of things. We had the gnocchi, crab \"rice\", and tomatoes to start. The tomatoes dish was a standout. It came with whipped ricotta and a flatbread with roasted garlic. The chef uses a lot of unique flavors and everything was perfectly seasoned. We had the tuna steak for our entree and it was prepared al pastor style. Definitely a very unique preparation of tuna and it was very tasty and a perfect entree to enjoy on a summer night. Overall, the meal was fantastic and I can't wait to go back !",

I strongly recommend the chilaquiles and my girlfriend loved the biscuits and gravy. Would rate 5 stars.   Dinner was more disappointing. I got the gnocchi and charred cauliflower. The second dish was fine, nothing to write home about but the gnocchi was not good. It was cooked way too long and became soggy. The brown butter didn't really go in my opinion. My friend went for the rainbow trout and was happy with the dish.   Between a 3 star dinner and 5 star brunch we find ourselves at 4 stars. I'm going to give Acorn one more chance for dinner, maybe it was just that 1 in 100th dish that doesn't get made to the quality they are going for. However, this place has rocketed to my top 3 favorite brunch spots!",

I ordered the escargot appetizer and it was tasty and well seasoned. I also tried two main dishes: a semolina mushroom pasta and duck with octopus. You can definitely taste the mushroom in the pasta, however, I found the dish overall to be a little lacking in flavor. Also, I like my pasta al dente, but this was slightly too chewy for my taste. The duck was amazing though. It was nice and tender and the sauce was really rich and delicious. The octopus was nice and soft and went really well with the overall flavor.  The service was great and the overall atmosphere would make this a great place for a romantic evening. I was also told that they change their menu frequently.",

    "text": "This little door on Walnut street is a special spot. Upon walking in, I was surprised to see there was seating that extended far back into the restaurant, and a seating style for every visitor. There's a few high tops right by the street windows, booths for those that want a little more privacy, bar stools if you plan to just chat over small plates & cocktails, and tables with many seats.   The atmosphere is inviting and upscale without being pretentious. There are tea lights lining the high top, full bar and soft but rich earthy colors setting a comfortable romantic vibe.   The menu is a bit eclectic, hiding really intricate ingredients and flavors within both the drinks and dishes. Ask the waiters about anything and everything. They're very knowledgeable on how each option is prepared and can help you choose exactly which dish you'll love. Be open minded when choosing as the options may be unfamiliar in many ways, but after this visit I really trust that everything on here is delicious.  This is a great chance to try complex flavor pallets and pair it with a cocktail you'd never make for yourself. A perfect spot for a special occasion. The bill will be quite expensive for Shadyside, however it's worth it in my opinion for this kind of detail oriented meal that's paired with a really lovely environment.   I'd stick to the menu though and probably refrain from the charcuterie board. Although piled with an array of options - I thought the board was a bit too heavy on cheese options, too light on breads/crackers to eat the meats and cheeses with, and you really had to work your way through the board to get to the different components. Everything was piled on top of other things and by the time we discovered our favorites on this board, we were too full to eat them. And honestly, at the end of the day, it's just another charcuterie board.  A great option for walking to if you live in Shadyside, otherwise there's some pay to park garages and lots off the side streets if all street parking is taken.",

    "text": "Acorn is a total fine dining experience in a professional but friendly and casual atmosphere.   It's not \"comfort food,\" it's inventive cuisine with combinations you likely haven't seen before, and so requires a willingness to be surprised by the varied tastes. The welcoming was warm;  the staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the ingredients and methods of preparation; bar menu was solid.  For starters we had the \"bread and butter,\" the oysters, calamaretti and the gougeres.  Entrees were lamb, NY strip and rigatoni.  It was a birthday celebration and the kitchen treated us to a chocolate mousse and a strawberry ice cream that were outstanding.  Acorn is a five-star addition to the Shadyside and Pittsburgh dining scene.",

    "text": "This sleek, modern simple space on Walnut Street in Pittsburgh's Shadyside neighborhood offers a variety of seating options -- tables, booths, high tops or at the beautiful modern wooden bar. Having eaten at restaurants all over Pittsburgh and the world, I'm pleased to have an option in Pittsburgh offering food preparations that I've yet to see or enjoy anywhere else. Add to that that they're as artfully prepared and visually stunning as any that I've ever seen. The set-up menu is a little quirky with small plates including some that could work as sides and some entrees that feed two more, but once you get the hang of it, it turns out to be perfect for tables that like to share and explore more menu items; plus the servers can help to steer you in the right direction. The oysters are my favorite app on the menu. A half dozen of them are served with a foam atop each one that adds just the right amount of zing. They're placed over seaweed and when served, hot oyster water is poured on the sides, to steam the oysters. A tomato and cucumber salad screams off fresh and rests in a dill dressing rather than being covered in it. Broccoli Tartine is a unique dish that would work as a starter or a side. Octopus with elote and queso is beyond delicious. A few entrees for two are among the options and one is a whole chicken. There's not a bone in it. The moist breasts are sliced, but the highlight is the tender thighs, lightly fried and served over dirty rice. A fermented coconut and a soy-based concoction work for dipping. Chicken leg confit combines with green papaya to make a sort of chicken papaya salad. A rigatoni entree with squash sofrito didn't disappoint. There's just two dessert options -- a lemon and a chocolate option, but they're each just the right size and served in an eye-popping colorful display that tastes every bit as good as it looks and includes unique ingredients such as meringue and fennel. Beers are only available on tap and are entirely local. It's a small, but interesting selection. The cocktail list includes some classics with a twist and there's a decent selection of wines as well. Servers and bartenders seem to be consistently pleasant and sweet. Some who have meat and potato preferences may complain that they don't understand the menu or that it's too expensive. Acorn may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for something truly different and unique, you're likely to love it. My only two complaints are things that can easily be addressed: It's a little too bright, but nothing that a dimmer switch won't resolve. It's also more than a little loud once it gets busy, but some acoustic tiles would easily help combat that.",

We are both foodies, and were sent to Acorn by a good Chicago foodie friend who knows the chef. We were staying in North Shore, so Shadyside was a bit of a drive. But the service, menu, and cocktails made it very worthwhile. We ordered the mussels and the tonnato. Delicious and great portions. Best mussels I've ever had. And the Sean Connery cocktail is a bourbon lover's dream. Highly recommend Acorn!",

My friend and I decided to taste a few different things, so we ordered 4 small plates and the bread pudding to share. Everything came was literally to taste ~$14 for only 2-3 bites. The dessert portion was Ok and we didn't try the entrees, so it might be the way to go. Honestly, there are so many great \"upscale\" restaurants in Pittsburgh where you actually pay the same amount of money but not leave like you went for food tasting. They will have to adjust the prices. In fact, it was not very crowded for a saturday night and this might be the reason. As of food, the gnocchi was my favorite, again I wish it was a little bigger. The cocktail I got was also a bit too sweet, the prices seemed ok though - wine was still a bit pricey and there weren't many options.. overall, I really think they have a great chef and it is a nice restaurant in a good location. Hence the 4 stars.. If they adjust the prices, I think it has the potential to become one of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh. Otherwise, I don't see myself going back.",

    "text": "This is actually a very attractive restaurant - what they have done with space that was formally an Asian restaurant is surprising. The space has a good feeling of a casual bistro. I have to say that initially we were extremely shocked when they handed the wine list to us There was literally only one bottle of wine for under $50.  Many were in the $70 range - with the average maybe being $100. (We eat in a lot of upscale restaurants and even world class restaurants all over the world, so we know wine prices.)  My husband was being sort of irritable with the waitress about the wine - owing to the fact that we had just arrived home after 19 hours of travel from Europe. I have to say that she handled his pointedness extremely well. While I know they are trying to do \"upscale\" food, this kind of a wine list is not fitting the type of place or price point of the food. That said, the GM came over and said that the waitress told him that we had been shocked by the wine list prices and he told us that they were currently in the process of reviewing this and correcting it. He also comped us wine that he was considering buying for the restaurant - which he certainly did not have to do. As far as food - I must say that my husband and I actually prefer menus that don't list so many of the ingredients ... as we find that you can often find something in the dish that you don't want if you scrutinize too closely. Additionally when we asked about a couple of the dishes, while many ingredients are listed, we learned some significant element that probably should have been mentioned was left out. This seems to be a recent trend - not specific to Acorn! Aside from that I must say that the food was excellent. It was beautifully presented, the portions were for appropriate for the price, and perfectly cooked. We had the short ribs appetizer as well as a crudo appetizer, and then we had the rib steak for two. The steak was perfectly done and the flavor was exceptional. Overall this was a lovely meal and I think with a couple kinks worked out, it should do great.",

The real problem is the noise. Ridiculous. We had to shout to talk at a dinner table far away from the bar. The wooden chairs are painful. I never have back pain, but promise you will after sitting in these torture chamber chairs. Did the chef not sit in them before he bought them? Unless you lean back real far (which is a hard way to eat), you will have piece of wood gouging your back the entire meal. The drink \"life is a peach\" had no peach flavor at all. The food is good, but the ambiance made us want to get out of there asap. No offer of anything for our anniversary.  Bill was over $200 with tip, only one drink each. Very disappointing.

    "text": "I lived near Walnut Street for 2 decades. I moved away to Seattle and was in town visiting. Let me tell you, this exceeded expectations for what \"good\" dining could be in Pittsburgh. This place is on the higher end for Pittsburgh, maybe about average for New York or Seattle. But the food is on par for what you might expect at a good big city restaurant, and the service was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place if you want a higher-end date that isn't too formal, or if you want a great dinner with a group of old friends you haven't seen for a while and you're trying to convince them to move back to Pittsburgh. ;) We tried the charcuterie (huge, meant for 3-4 people), the Brussels Tartine (AMAZING), Tortana (good), and the main pasta entree. Everything was good or amazing. The beer selection was on point. I was impressed. Would return here the next time.",

    "text": "I admit I'm not one for exotic meals but I shouldn't need nearly every menu item explained because I can't tell by the title what the food actually is. This is advertised as an American restaurant but the waiter's first question to me upon learning I'm a meat and potatoes person was \"Do you like curry and Indian food?\" What?!? The bread and butter appetizer and the potatoes dish were good (though that was hardly \"potato salad,\" the description by the waiter.) The monkfish portion certainly fed two. My drink Life is a Peach was bland - no peach flavor at all. The wait staff was attentive so there's a plus. This restaurant is EXTREMELY noisy - so don't expect to hear the person across from you or even the waiter unless you're practically shouting. Most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in - the wooden back is tilted. While they look nice and contemporary, theu tilted wood hits you right in your lower back. It is painful! So to avoid the pain, you have to lean forward the entire meal. Now for the real pain : the bill! This is a VERY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT.  My husband is a foodie and while we will pay good money for good food, this place (given the entire experience) is not worth it. There are many truly awesome restaurants in Pittsburgh that have great innovative food, along with creative staples to suit my palate, that do not leave me walking out in physical and financial discomfort. So... Let the Acorn drop off your list of places to try.",

    "text": "We went the first night acorn was officially open. I usually avoid restaurants that new to avoid the learning curve.  The service and food were so spectacular I never would've known it was the first night. Someone in our party asked how long they've been open. We were shocked to hear the answer.  We took friends back for a second visit and were equally pleased.  Acorn makes the ordinary extraordinary. The bean side and the beet side were mouthwateringly delicious.  The bread was as well.  Every bite of each thing we ordered was enjoyed thoroughly.  Four of us split the monkfish. The server was very informed and patient.  He took the time to explain the menu and never pushed us to order more than we were comfortable. His feeling was that we could always order more.  Save room for dessert.  Both offerings are exceptional.  We ordered one of each both visits because we couldn't choose. They're delicious!",

We wanted a slow, relaxing meal and the waiter, shawn, totally picked that up and respected that and was knowledgeable and attentive but not overbearing. We did a cocktail, bottle of wine, and small plates and it was so good. The food was unique and clever. Rich but not overly filling or dense. The octopus was the best we've had in Pittsburgh. Pricey but definitely worth it.",

Honestly Pittsburgh doesn't have many good restaurants but this place stands out from the others such as tako, meat and potatoes which are good too but there's only like five in Pittsburgh. very unique restaurant, and loved the atmosphere and drinks. Do not agree with the two stars, they are probably just griping about the price but hey u gotta pay good money for good food",
