I always recommend them to people looking for a pizza. But today was dooms day. After a long day at work I didn't wanna do anything expect watch the walking dead and cuddle and binge on some pizza and wings. We waited close to an hour for the food to arrive which I didn't mind cause like I said, I loved them. Walking up the steps to my apt a roach crawls up and out of the pizza box. I swear on everything holy. So I call them and tell them and to my surprise they don't even argue it they tell me to come get my money back. So already fuming I drive downtown from south side and get stuck in traffic in the 10st tunnel. When I get there we simply received an \"I'm sorry\" and a refund. What? Is that really all you had to say? A roach crawled out of my pizza box! Needless to say I'm never eating there again. Traumatized. I took my refund and went to Luke Wholeys and that kicked butt! My review for that soon to come haha.",

We ordered a large pizza and a dozen wings (they have a special, that combo is $18). Half way through our first slice of pizza my friend and I both looked at each other and asked \"what do you think?\" We both said \"not bad, but certainly not good.\" The pizza is your standard cheap cheese, meh, overly sweet sauce, and un-remarkable crust. We each had two pieces and haven't been able to bring ourselves to touch the left overs. The wings, much like the pizza, weren't bad but they weren't good. They were on the smaller side and the sauce (hot) lacked any sort of flavor.   We opted to pick up the pizza rather than have it delivered. The interior of this restaurant is filthy. Everything that you touch is sticky and greasy, the floor is caked in dirt, and there were old food scraps (mushrooms, some cheese, a pizza crust, napkins) all over the floor by the cooler and cash register. The restaurant also had a funk to it.   Giovanni's was worth a shot if only to find out that I should never order from here again.",

The club wrap is delicious too! It has turkey, ham, bacon, provolone, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onions and mayo on a spinach wrap. IT IS EPIC!   They offer free fast delivery as well!

It's a pretty small shop--about three or four tables against the wall--and isn't the type of place you hang around after you're done eating. The register is located near the back of the shop, and the kitchen is at the front end.  We just got three slices of plain pizza, which cost $6. I'd probably need two or three slices for a full meal. They brought it out warm. It was good but not really outstanding in any way. I'll need to return when I have more time to try more items from their menu.",

    "text": "Absolutely TERRIBLE service! Delivered us the wrong pizza. Second time they came with the correct pizza, but the driver misunderstood their boss and left it for the hotel front desk staff to eat!!! We NEVER GOT OUR PIZZA. They are the most incompetent staff I have ever encountered. Here's what happened. Last night at 9:26 I called and placed an order for a medium pizza, half cheese half broccoli and onion, to be delivered to the double tree hotel downtown. At 9:59 the driver called me to meet him in the lobby, we paid cash, tipped $5 and discovered upon opening it in our room that it was a mushroom pizza. I called the place at 10:04 and let the girl know the driver brought the wrong pizza. She said they would send it out again and would be 20 minutes. At 10:48 I called because it had been so long, and the girl said the driver couldn't get ahold of me and left it at the front desk. I let her know they did not call me and the hotel didn't call my room. She said to go down and check. When I asked the girl at the front desk if our pizza was there she said, wait, did it have broccoli? I said YES, what happened. She said the delivery driver told her it was for them, and that sometimes the places drop off free pizzas because the hotel hands out their menus. So, I called the pizza place back and the same girl I'd been dealing with said I was right, and that the driver never called and he misunderstood their manager. She said they would send a new pizza. I asked for my money back too, but she said they couldn't do both!?!? Like WTF, it's been almost two hours since I placed my order, they screwed it up royally, and they can't give me a free pizza to make it \"right\"? Where is the common decency? Then she had the audacity to ask if I also wanted my tip back. Um...YES! Duh. And when the driver called me telling me he was in the lobby with the money, i left the hotel bar quickly to meet him, he wasn't there, he was parking his car. Lies, lies, lies. I will never spend my money there again, it's a place who doesn't give a crap about integrity and doing great business. Never ordering from there again. Ever.",

    "text": "I overlooked the bad service reviews on Giovanni's hoping I would at least get great food if I did pickup. I called in my order expecting it to be ready in 30 mins as I was told. My wings were sitting when I arrived. However Giovanni's had difficulty making a medium pizza to fulfill the order.  I requested a refund for my order after numerous inquiries and 40 minutes waiting. The counter and line cooks were in disarray and visibly arguing.  The manager asked if I would like to pay for the wings. I responded I wouldn't  feel comfortable paying for wings that have been sitting on the sink counter for over 40 minutes. The service was so unapologetically bad I didn't get to experience any food ... good or bad.  Hopefully Giovanni's refunded my credit card correctly so I can suppress this bad experience.  UPDATE:  Giovanni's not only charged my credit card but added the tip for non-service.  Thanks for teaching me a lesson ... pay for pick-up after receiving the food.",

It looked authentically good from the outside but the slices I received could easily have been passed for reheated lunchtime leftovers. They were soggy, overcooked, and just lukewarm.  Not a lot of flavor to the sauce or the cheese likely because they were close to being stale. I hope their usual provisions are far better than what I experienced.    Not my first recommendation. Sorry!",

When dinnertime came around, Giovanni's was highly recommended by the front desk as a local place that delivers to the hotel.  The menu was very extensive, and when asked about tweaking an item (due to a food allergy)... It was no problem at all.  Food was fresh and delicious... And delivery came directly to our hotel room door about 10-15 minutes sooner than promised.   Would definitely recommend and will be ordering from them again next time I'm in town.",

Upon entering, we had to walk past several sets of older looking tables and chairs (that were pushed up next to the wall), in order to get to the ordering counter. Our order was promptly processed. The cashier then proceeded to get us styrofoam glasses of water. However, she was unable to locate the water dispenser on the pop machine. After requesting help from another employee, the cashier was eventually able to get the glasses of water for us. However, the water was slightly pink, since the glasses were not completely emptied out after the several attempts to fill them with water from the dispenser.  After waiting for nearly 30 minutes, our extra large cheese pizzas were ready. A female employee apologized for the delay. The pizzas were piping hot when served.They had thin crusts and a tasty and slightly sweet sauce. It was quite unique and delicious. As we were departing, a female employee thanked us. I will most likely return in the future, but possibly carry out my order the next time.",

Our total came to $32 and I payed with two $20 bills. It was as if he knew the shtick.

However, on Saturdays it is not open upstairs until 5pm! Football games are on. Sunday it is closed upstairs. What?? The football playoffs are this Sunday. We would love to come here more often, but if the upstairs isn't open to watch sports, we will not come there. The downstairs is fine if you like to sit in a windowless bar with low tables.

I'm usually a bit skeptical when it comes to pizza places in the city because a majority of them are very similar with what they offer.  Most every pizza place offer the traditional and nontraditional pizza, hoagies, wings, calzones, Stromboli, salads, etc.  So that is what I thought when we first ordered from here, it's going to be more of the same.  I was a little wrong with this assumption, which my coworkers won't let me forget.  I was the one that was hesitant while looking over the menu, making my coworkers get a little agitated with me.  But you don't want to order something that you end up not eating.  After much consideration I went with what they call Bread Twists.  I was thinking that this was going to be what other places call house rolls.  Wrong.  What you get looks more like a calzone with less breading.  Shaped like a C instead of it being twisted.  The right amount of filling is laid out appropriately for this mini fest.  Comes with a side of marinara for dipping.  It was kind of like a Hot Pocket, but without that cardboard taste.  Fast and free delivery.  Order online.",

    "text": "We ordered delivery from this restaurant and mistakenly looked at the menu for the South Hills location (granted, our fault). We tried to order a spinach, feta, and tomato bread twist and were told that we would be charged an extra $5 because they would have to \"specially make it\" since it wasn't on their menu. We then tried to order a small buffalo chicken salad and were told it didn't exist, and we could order a regular sized one for $12 (it is listed on their menu as $10). They have a small grilled chicken salad, but no buffalo. How hard is it to add buffalo to the grilled chicken?!  The food arrived and we had been charged incorrectly for the wings and the salad, the ice we requested didn't arrive, the pizza was cold, and one of the salads didn't come with the garlic bread or dressing. We called to request that they fix our order, and we were told that we were wrong. The manager was really argumentative, so finally we just asked for our money back. They told us because we had only ordered from them once (which wasn't True) we couldn't get our money back. Why does that even matter? They finally agreed to give us our money back but said they would pick up the food. WHAT?! You want the food back?! Why in the world would you return the food that we have already opened?  We had eaten the small salad (which was a tiny, tiny salad for almost $8) so they told us we couldn't have our money back for it since it was eaten.  The worst service I have ever, ever seen. I would recommend staying away from this place at all costs.",

She had a polite tone, but when I told her that I live in Robinson Township and wanted to confirm delivery, she said they don't deliver to Robinson.

I had the grilled chicken salad with homemade Greek dressing -- everything prepared fresh except the cold vegetables, which were cut that morning -- and homemade Chicken Vegetable soup. Came with a healthy slice (as in size, not nutrition value) of garlic bread. Awesome. Came out quick, tasted great. Salad had a blend of mozzarella and provolone cheese on it which added to the flavor. Veggies were crisp. Chicken was seasoned lightly and warm. Didn't get to the Greek dressing -- are the salad too quickly. I could leave the soup; kinda bland and not much chicken, but at least it was part of a $7.99 lunch special (small salad, soup, garlic bread).   I'm here on business so I'm not sure I'll ever be back, but if you're around you should go. Perfect for a quick lunch.",

    "text": "Half-decent food. Absolutely abysmal customer service.   I was working a show at the Benedum Center and placed a large order here ($150+) for the performers and crew to eat post-show. I ordered earlier in the afternoon and arranged a 9:45pm pickup (in other words, there was plenty of time to look at the order and get it right). I started to order online, but it was one of those websites that make you register, and I'm not local, so I didn't want to continue getting promo emails etc. for the rest of my life. Instead, I printed out the order directly from the order page and sent our venue runner with it to place the order (again, approximately 9 hours in advance).  Upon pick up, we discovered 2 of the sandwiches were wrong (like, not even close to what we ordered - called something completely different, and listed on an entirely separate area of the website). I called and politely asked if I could send our runner back so we could swap those out for what we ordered. The girl says she has to get a manager. The manager gets on and I explain and he says \"Well it says here in front of me that you ordered this\" I said \"No, and in fact I printed the full order directly from your website and I'm looking at it right now. That's not what was ordered.\" (Mind you, this is about $12 worth of sandwiches out of a $150+ order for crew members that work really hard and deserve to eat what they want at the end of a long day). He says \"Well you're putting me in a really stick situation right now because what you're saying you ordered isn't what I have written down here.\" Are you serious? How is it our problem that you wrote down the wrong thing when I literally gave you a printout of the order DIRECTLY from your own website? We weren't even asking for them to deliver it, and we offered to bring the wrong ones back, and I'm putting HIM in a sticky situation? GTFO. Literally the worst customer service. If your business can't afford to eat $12 on your own mistake, then maybe you should find another calling.   I told him just forget it and hung up, and unfortunately our crew guys had to eat pizza because the sandwiches they received were disgusting. It's actually a shame because the pizzas were actually pretty good, but do yourself a favor and go somewhere that actually cares about their customers.",

    "text": "We've been ordering Giovanni's for several years and it's aaaaaalways been my absolute favorite pizza shop in Pittsburgh. Until now. The last 5 or so times we have ordered there has been something wrong. We order French fries with cheese often and used to get a nice large amount but one time they literally gave us like a handful of burnt fries. I didn't call and complain because this is my favorite pizza place and I figured everyone has bad days. Next time we ordered the fries, the cheese was SO spoiled! It was sour and inedible. Tonight, We ordered again. The pizza was delivered with half the cheese slid off over to the other side. It was so mushy and undercooked that we had to eat it with forks. Basically we ate cheese and pepperoni. The real kicker is the wings. The chicken itself has a funky taste? Four of us all agreed and we now have wings to throw away. Unfortunately, I cannot trust this place anymore so we will no longer be ordering after being a long time customer. I will sadly have to find a new favorite pizza joint! I'm not sure if there is new owners or new staff, but it has seriously gone down hill. :(  I had to at least provide 3 stars for the many years of delicious food. But that no longer exists.",

Well after about an hour and a half I called back to see where the pizza was and they told me it was on its way, well then I waited another 30 minutes and called again they said it's on it's way so after 2 hours of waiting I decided to call the hotel to make sure they didn't get the room wrong the hotel said that know no had came in it's now 3am and the restaurant is closed so I can't even call them!! The next day I call to see what happened and to get my money back and the manager wants to start arguing with me telling me that they brought it and tried to call me someone's lying here!!!! poor customer service wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy!",

However, I've probably put in over 20 deliveries this year and can see the inconsistencies.  My waistline shows...  1. Your pizza  sauce is delicious.   Perfect sweet/garlic balance.   2.  Your meatballs are not good.  I will no longer pay a premium for your 16 inch baguette loaded with freezer burnt meatballs and a spoonful of your delicious sauce.  3. How...how do you get off on charging such a high premium to customize a pie?????  I ordered a medium mushroom and onion and it cost me $20+  Regardless, you pie slingers continue to provide much needed late night vittles.  I hope (for your sake), that you can accept the above criticism and improve on consistency.",

The pizza has a sweet sauce, so many people here enjoyed it. Just know that's what you are in for! The breadsticks was actually a slice of french bread with cheese on it - not bad, but nothing I'd get again.  We will probably order again if we are looking for delivery - but based on today's experience I may not seek them out when I'm looking for pizza downtown.",

My pizza was boxed up and in my hand before my credit card was finished processing.  Second, taste. DAMN. This might be tied for my favorite pizza of all time (held by Crossroads of Hellertown PA). The sauce was flavorful, the cheese was baked just right, the crust was crispy on the bottom but soft in the center. The pepperoni was thinly sliced and added a crispy/spicy element. Amazing. So well done.  I live in NJ, but it's tempting to make the 285 mile trip to have this again. I ordered from here three times during my stay. My arteries may hate me, but hey. Great pizza.",

And also because they seem to be the only place with the garlic dipping sauce.   But after the last delivery when someone with no phone skills and very little English called me three times and still wasn't delivering my pizza I thought \"enough.\" The piece de resistance when he delivered a pizza swimming in cheese (after I requested that they go easy) and no pepperoni (I clicked the box) an hour and twenty minutes after I had placed the order. I sent the pizza back with the driver and called the store and demanded a refund.   Apparently, this is when the whole situation became my fault. I sent the pizza back without calling them, the order didn't have pepperoni on it and the pizza WAS NOT dripping with cheese. I still demanded they refund me. They said I would be credited with another pizza. I explained that I would not ever set forth in their business again because I was done. They hung up and no refund has been forthcoming. Seriously this place just doesn't get it.   And frankly I haven't found a pizza place in Pittsburgh that does get it yet. I am so disappointed because I thought this city with its rich Italian culture would have awesome pizza. Not at all. Sigh.  Find better pizza somewhere else if you can.

Let me tell you, I love their pizza, but inside the shop certainly ain't cute (they're working on it). I was put off, I almost didn't go in. What a dark world that would have been. The first thing I ordered was a small, plain pie. Seriously, as soon as I tasted it, I said, \"This is the best pizza I've ever had\"  Well, my love affair with Giovanni's is still going strong. Countless slices later, I have since then brought all of my friends to the shop. They also have fallen in love with Giovanni's. I've ordered catering (30+ people), whole pies, slices on the go, pasta, french fries, and salads all of which have been great. Their sauce is sweet and their dough is fluffy. The cheese, at it's freshest, is melted to perfection.  Now, I'm no fool. I know Giovanni's isn't perfect. One time I tried to order online only to wait two hours, call the shop, and find my order never was filled. One time the delivery man didn't bring the soda I ordered. Their interior is rough and sometimes the service is short. But ultimately, that's all part of the local pizza shop charm.    I'm moving out of Pittsburgh at the end of the year, and, honestly, one of the things I'm saddest about is leaving Giovanni's. So, please, for me, go get a slice. It just might change your life.",

    "text": "I had a cheese pizza slice and garlic bread with cheese.  The pizza was pretty ordinary, very similar to a frozen pizza.  They put plenty of cheese on the pizza.  The crust is also very unremarkable, certainly not great but also not terrible.  The garlic bread was also pretty ordinary.  The pizza sauce is very sweet, lacking Italian flavors.    The prices are very reasonable.  The cheese slice was $1.85, and the garlic was $2.49.  They have both fountain drinks and canned pop.  They have free refills on the fountain drinks.  The wait staff is very friendly, and the food came out relatively quickly.  The dining area is pretty small.  The tables seat 6 people, but they do not have room for enough people, so don't be surprised if you have to sit with strangers, which happened to me.  However, I had a nice conversation with my table guests.  The location is also really great if you are on the way to a show or a Pirates game.",

What a shit place this has turned into. It wasn't like this a year ago. Now, by degrees, they've lost at least $200/month from a loyal customer, on rudeness, piss-poor customer service, and crappy recipes they won't even admit to (cutting corners and half-cooked as well).

    "text": "I've been here previously about a year ago (no review for my last visit) but my review would be largely the same except for the service;  I've given a 2 star rating on my current visit but before I critique I should point out the things I did like. The food was good, admittedly, and the portions are quite large which is nothing to complain about. The wait was average and the food was hot - all good things!   Now, there were a couple things that peeved me about my visit today - the service was poor. I understand that the city of Pittsburgh is very upfront and rough and the quick dining and atmosphere definitely plays on that.   The cashier Ashley however gave off such a \"I really don't want to be here\" vibe by exchanging as minimal words as humanly possible and showed absolutely no sign of enthusiasm or positivity. The rest of the staff that isn't facing the customer view doesn't have to be ecstatic and happy but the one who's literal only job is to be the face of service should at least be kind and courteous.  Not only that, but my girlfriend was given garlic bread with her pasta that had a large green mold spot on the underside - and when she kindly asked for a new one, the same cashier said no words, not even a sorry, or any empathy, and gave her another piece of bread with moldy spots on it again.  There are much better pasta and pizza places closer to the DLCC and Westin hotels if that's where you happen to be staying - if friends really wanted to come here and invited me I might go again but on my own will I'll probably never visit again.",

Unfortunately I cant speak to any other of their food, but the plain pizza was absolutely awesome. The sauce is a little sweet. This place definitely cares about the product they make.

    "text": "Great pizza. We only had a bad experience once with them (which I'll go into later). Since I won't base my rating based on past experiences, I'm giving this place four stars.  I've only ever gotten pizza from them. The first thing I noticed every time we got a pie was it came to us fast and it was still hot! Often when you get a delivery, the pizza comes warmish but not piping hot. This is a definite plus.  The cheese and toppings are great. I didn't notice the sauce being too sweet but its just right. The dough is delicious. Its fluffy and chewy at the same time. I always say the secret of a good pizza is in the dough and these guys deliver.  I've never gotten their hoagies or salads but several of my coworkers would order one of their salads pretty much every night. They raved about the chicken and feta salad, a salad they felt needed no dressing. It always looked good but I have a hard time paying $10 or more for a salad. Another coworker always got the Italian sausage hoagie. I never tried it but it always looked good. Nice, crusty bread. Lots of meat and cheese piled high.  This place is a bit more expensive than some of the other choices downtown or on the Northside but (except for this one time), the food has always been great.  This one time? We ordered three large pizzas on a Saturday. When they got here, the pizzas were soaked in water. We called back and they fought with us over it. They said they were so wet because they used canned mushrooms. This is a lie because for starters, they use fresh mushrooms, not canned ones. Secondly, the two pizzas without mushrooms were soaked. Thirdly, I've worked in a pizza kitchen before. Even if the cook was super sloppy and opened up a can of mushrooms and just dumped it out of the can, water and all, it wouldn't have produced the amount of fluid on the pizza.  Honestly, I think they used some cheese that had gotten frozen and had formed ice crystals. And they were trying to get rid of the cheese instead of wasting it. They sent us a free pizza....that was the same way. We vowed never to order from them again. Most of us stuck to our guns.  Today, management ordered us pizza so we didn't have to break our word. The pizzas we got today were fine. Quite tasty, as always (except that one time). They just had a bad day and, unfortunately, chose not to throw away the bad cheese. Oh well, I'm not going to hate on them forever for a couple of bad pizzas.",

We grabbed two slices of pepperoni. The pizza was amazing. The sweet sauce is probably the best part of the pizza. For those of you who bash this place for their sauce, you have no right even commenting on pizza. You have no idea what your talking about. If you want some bland chunky sauce, stick to Pizza Hut. The pepperonis were the little crispy ones that I love. This place might be a bit dirty but the pizza speaks for itself. The slices were $3.00 a piece, but were huge. Worth every penny for downtown prices. Give this place a shot after a Bucco game or show, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Stopped in for a late-night meal while visiting the area. We ordered a one-topping pizza, two orders of garlic bread (one with cheese on top and one plain), and two drinks (one fountain and one bottled) - total price was right around $21. Perfect quantity for my family of 4 - there was nothing left over, but everyone was full and couldn't have eaten more if it was free.   Good casual place that we walked in, ordered, and got fresh hot food within just a few minutes. The food was great - enjoyed by all.",

The last two times the pizza had been dropped or held sideways and all of the toppings slid off to the side of the box. This time, I called and they offered to remake the pizza. After an hour, I called again and they said the pizza was on the way that the driver would \"drop it off after dropping off his other orders\". Finally after another half hour, the pizza arrived and was no longer even warm.  Having taken 2.5 hours from ordering only to get a cold pizza, I called and asked to speak to the manager but was told \"I have no idea when to expect him. He goes back and forth across the street to his other restaurant and comes and goes.\" I asked if she would take my information to have him call me at his convenience and was put on hold. She never came back and eventually the line hung up on me.  Bottom line- the quality used to be good but it's been hit or miss of late and their customer service is nonexistent. There are plenty of other pizza paces to chose from.",

Wifey and I definitely needed some food after our Uber dropped us off at the at the hotel so we walked down the street to Giovanni's to give Pittsburgh pizza a shot.  There's only one table in the place so we took it and our slices were on the table in two minutes. The people running the place were super nice. Neither of us loved the pizza, but it hit the spot and did what it was supposed to do. The pizza tasted ok, but the snob in me needs more than that. The crust was too thick and the sauce was way too sweet for my Jersey taste, but as someone who was a little drunk it hit the spot. No idea if this is good 'Pittsburgh pizza' or not so you'll have to decide for yourself.",

I got chicken Alfredo, a large cheese pizza and a full size Italian hoagie all for my boyfriend and I last night. The Alfredo was truly amazing. Probably one of the best Alfredo pasta dishes I've had in a long time. The chicken was juicy and seasoned so nicely. The sauce was creamy, cheesy and amazing! It came with a salad and garlic bread, the salad was nice and fresh, and the garlic bread was homemade. So so so good! My boyfriend raved about his sub, it was it really good, and he could tell it was made fresh on the grill. Our pizza was spectacular as well. Nice soft dough crust and enough cheese and sauce on it to make it a great pie! The portions were huge and for a great price, I could barely finish my pasta because they just gave so much, but I powered through it, because it was just that good. I'm most definitely going to have to try some of their other menu items, because I'm sure they will be just as good. I think this might be my new go to pizza joint.",

Furthermore, any RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS OWNER with any inkling of how to treat their customer base would not have shot down my comment. Any RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS OWNER would have said something like this: \"We are so sorry that you didn't receive the level of quality that we expect to deliver to all of our customers. While we do have our ovens set to \"perfectly\" cook pizzas, it's possible that there was something mechanically wrong, or there was a human error. We hope that this experience doesn't keep you from coming back and trying us out again! Thank you for your feedback!\"  But you know what?

The most confusing yet delightful thing about getting pizza from Giovanni's is the dark cheese that looks burnt. It absolutely tastes better than it looks. Still, know that this is pizza for drunks. If it's not piping hot, it's total rubbish. And if it is piping hot and you're here at 1am, you'll likely burn the roof of your mouth.  Everytime I eat here, it seems to be under renovations with empty pizza boxes stacked up everywhere. It is a bit of a hole, and I'd probably never choose to eat here stone sober, but their pepperoni slices with overcooked cheese and inadvertently \"crunchy\" pepperoni seemingly hit the spot every time.

What was delivered was a half-cooked pizza with a TON of sausage on it. Waaaay more sausage than I've ever gotten on a regular sausage pizza before. Couldn't see or smell any vestiges of egg. Vast departure from the many breakfast pizzas we've ordered from them before.   We called & the woman that answered the phone was pleasant, heard us out & said they'll send out the correct pizza in exchange for the uneaten, incorrect one. She verified our address then put us on hold. All of a sudden Nate, the cook/manager, got on the phone stating that the pizza isn't wrong, that he cooked it, doesn't make mistakes & that he cannot & will not replace the pizza OR give us a refund. He also stated that since we paid with a debit card, that it isn't even possible for him to issue a refund. He laughed the whole time & told me that I needed to eat the pizza to tell that there was egg on it. \"Take a bite...hahahaha...eat the pizza!\", he kept saying.   I asked who his boss is & he said his boss is the owner & he's not there. I asked what his name was & when he'd be in next. Nate then told me he didn't know when he'd be in & that he's never even met the owner & didn't even know his name. He finally said that he was busy & just hung up on me. I called back & spoke with another young man & asked for the owner's name & he told me it was Alihan & then quickly said, \"There were eggs on that pizza! Alihan will back us up on that!\" & quickly hung up the phone.  All I wanted was the pizza that I paid for or a refund & all I got was harassed, belittled & taken by some of the most indignant & disrespectful staff that I've ever encountered. This is the WORST experience I've ever had with a pizza joint, let alone any customer-facing establishment. Absolutely disturbing & TERRIBLY unprofessional.",

    "text": "We live in Polish Hill and often have a hard time finding quality pizzerias and restaurants from the East End that will deliver to us---presumably because we are just a \"tad\" too far outside their delivery radius or because we share a zip code with the \"dreaded\" Hill District.   One day we found a Giovanni's door-hanger with coupons shoved in our mailbox, and given that I had also just worked a long day delivering food for another business I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did!  We've regularly been ordering Giovanni's for delivery ever since. I tend to not eat much all day due to my hectic work schedule and then GORGE myself late at night. I've ordered buffalo chicken and/or Greek-styled salads several times now, loaded with every topping imaginable (anchovies, double feta cheese, french fries, black olives, gyro meat, double dressings, etc.), and each time they've been delicious AND correct! Normally since the salad toppings are compartmentalized within the clam shell plastic container I'll drag a pot out from the kitchen and toss the salad around in it with the dressing and then eat it right from the pot! With rare exception the salads have been average to above-average. There was one occasion where I didn't want to eat any more of my chicken because so much of it was gristly, but everything else has been consistently edible and tasty. Considering I've had low-quality gristly chicken in a LOT of restaurants lately I'm beginning to think this is more of a Pittsburgh problem than a Giovanni's problem.   The other reviewers are correct that the pizza sauce's sweetness is an acquired taste. We like sweeter sauce, so for us Giovanni's is a smashing hit. We've ordered several different types of pizzas over the past year or so, and we've never found ourselves disappointed in the taste or quality. Most of the time we find we have to re-cut the pizza slices, though, as they aren't cut all the way through. I'd rather wait an extra minute for my pizza to be properly cut than to have to cut it myself at home when all I want to do is graze like a cow after a 12-hour shift at work, but that's a small complaint.   Finally, I've never before had an eatery \"reward\" me for ordering online. Giovanni's provides customers who place online delivery orders above a certain dollar amount with a free order of cheesy bread (more like a cheese stromboli)! I'm not a fan of it just as it comes, so we usually add extra cheese and/or pepperoni to kick it up a notch for $1 or $2 additional. Typically when we order a large pizza, modified (free) cheesy bread, and one of these overloaded custom salads (that they actually had to call on once to verify I indeed wanted all of those toppings!) we have food for three days, so while this might run us $45-$50, including tip, it's in-line for what we'd spend for three day's worth of food for both of us otherwise.   Is this the best pizza I've ever had? No. Is it in my \"Top 5\" for Pittsburgh? Yes.   Are these the best salads I've ever had? No. Are they in my \"Top 5\" for Pittsburgh? Possibly. Then again if I want just a delicious fresh salad I'd definitely just head to Whole Foods.",

Too greasy (I understand pizza is meant to be greesy, but really??) and the sauce seems like it adds sugar and is just plain too sweet for my tastes.   I like my pizza plain. Cheese, that's it; however work orders this \"Pittsburgh pizza\" which is quite interesting. Very primanti's like, so if you are in the mood for an adventure you should try it.",

    "text": "If you had asked me several years ago what my favorite pizza was in Pittsburgh, I would have said hands down Giovanni's. I was in there a few days ago with a friend before heading over to a Bucs game. Told my out-of-towner that Giovanni's had great pizza. We just wanted a quick slice and were sorely disappointed. Tasted old and stale. Cheese and sausage were so greasy I had to wipe it off with a napkin. The again it was only $2.50 and I did't care much, but man, I was embarrassed. Maybe you gotta order a whole pie like I've done in the past. They were good. Dad-gum good! The place lacks  decor, the bathrooms are putrid, and the tables were dirty. But then again, some times that is what you are looking for. I am far from a food snob, but when I want some greasy, mediocre, cheap pizza, that what I expect to get. Unfortunately, my pizza this past visit did not meet those expectations. But guess what? I'll be back. Hey, I'm a sucker, and I'll want a slice before a Bucs game again.",

    "text": "I hate salads.  But I'm getting fat, so I've been trying to incorporate them into my meat-and-potatoes (french fries) based diet.  Since I own no vegetables, I've been ordering out for my salads, growing weary of the stereotypical pizza place's pile of browned lettuce topped with a few limp, tired pieces of meat.  That being said, the chicken salad I just ordered from Giovanni's is the best salad I've ever had.  For the first time, I had to dig under a monstrous pile of chicken and cheese to find the lettuce, instead of the other way around.  I didn't even have to use the dressing (which I usually pile on to cover the taste of vegetable).  It's kind of pricey ($10) but it's a huge salad, and half of it filled me up.  It may have negated the whole health factor I was shooting for.  But it was well worth it, for having a genuinely pleasant salad experience.  Thank you Giovanni's, you have just become my go-to salad take out.",

They dumped an obscene amount of sugar in there. I couldn't even taste the cheese or the vegetables on the pizza. The only savory taste came from the meatballs, which were not that great. I also had their cheesecake. Not horrible, with a nice cheese tang, but again ungodly sweet for cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake. It came with a strawberry \"topping\", and that is used loosely. This had to be the worst topping/jam I have ever eaten. Nothing but sugar, and no fruit taste.",

The toppings were a perfect balance of cheese, spinach and onions (I asked them to hold the shrooms and they actually did). YUM! It arrived hot and, dare I say it again, perfect.

I can imagine this place gets elbow to elbow at times. ONE TIP: Let the pizza cool before you eat it, pick up a hot slice and you lose all your cheese not to mention it's molten hot out of the oven.

To give some credit, we've been here for slices on walks home from the ballpark and were very satisfied - but what was delievered to our house the other night was terrible. For one, the pizza looked like it had experienced a head on collision in the box, the cheese/toppings were displaced over to one side and the lid a mess. For two, it was watery. For three, the sauce is terrible, nothing about is fresh tasting - overly sweet and like its poured directly out of the can onto the pie.   It used to be that Ephesus was the best pizza delievery in the Southside - but then something changed with their pizza and we are scrambling to find a replacement. Giovanni's wont be it.

The crust was heavier than a thin crust and more flaky, and the sauce was okay. The oil and texture suggested that the slice had been cooked twice, and I think you would strongly benefit from ordering a fresh pie if you brought enough crew to make that an appropriate order. Outside of the pie, the bread twists with pepperoni were damn good, probably better than the pizza. The acoustical tiles in the ceiling have seen better days, so it's not exactly an anniversary dinner spot if you get my drift, but a fine enough stop for slice on the way to the ballgame.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Thursday before a show with a dining companion.  Upon walking into the restaurant there is not too much to notice except for the area where they cook and some old booths against a wall.  A closer inspection of the wall will show some nice Pittsburgh sports memorabilia though.  For our pizza my dining companion and I decided upon the plain extra large cheese pizza.  The extra large pizza is a 18\" pizza which may seem a bit much for two people but we easily gobbled it all up since it tasted so good.  What makes the Giovanni's pizza incredibly good is the sauce.  It could be described as slightly sweet but is really something that should be tasted instead of described.  The cheese is also satisfactory and the crust is thin but good.  I have been to Giovanni's many times before and it has never disappointed.  The only thing that is frustrating is having to sit and stare at it while the cheese cools down as it will otherwise not stay on the piece.  The bottom line for me is that the pizza is fantastic and even though it is not much to look at, I will be back here again many times in the future as I would consider this the best pizza in the city.",

I am not the biggest pizza fan out there but I agreed to try.  We got a half sausage/half cheese and pepperoni pizza.  I enjoyed the taste of the sauce and it had a nice amount of meat on the pie.    In subsequent visits, I've tried the pasta, a hoagie and various salads.  None of the items would be rated as the best I've ever had somewhere, but they were all enjoyable. I have found that their pizzas taste best when consumed pretty quickly.    If you eat there, it is important to know there are very few tables and it can get chilly from the front door opening and closing.   Overall an enjoyable experience and a go to place for me when ordering lunch to be delivered to Allegheny Center Mall.",

Then just apparently stood in the lobby waiting for me to come down? Do homeowners come to the driveway? Why would i come down? Then after a few minutes (5 tops), he finally came up. He hung up on me 2x. Complaining he waited for 15min! Needless to say there was no tip.  6. This place is so overpriced as well!  7. Dont waste your time or money!",

After a quick glance on Yelp to make sure this place was somewhat safe to try, we entered and queued up.  Options for a slice were limited to cheese or cheese & pepperoni.  I opted for the latter and within a few minutes was munching down on a delicious slice.  The crust was a traditional hand tossed, and the sauce was sweet.  I really enjoyed the sauce, but the edge of the crust was a little chewier than I prefer.  A little extra toasting of the crust would have appealed to me more, but it was delicious nonetheless.  Be sure to load up on the parmesan cheese, garlic power and Italian seasoning available at the register.",

    "text": "Often a 2-star review suggests that the reviewer is angry about some aspect of the service that has nothing to do with the food (e.g., the delivery took too long, the waitstaff was rude, they didn't like the color of the drapes, etc.), and can summarily be dismissed.  I was perfectly happy with the service--  This review is about the pizza.  In fact, it presents a dissenting view: this pizza is bad, folks.  Perhaps my mistake was ordering an extra large, since the whole pizza-eating experience oozed with the sensation of someone trying to cut corners.  The toppings were straight out of a can, tepidly warmed in the oven.  The crust was mushy and watery, a texture that could not be disguised by any amount or kind of sauce.  The cardboard shell surrounding the pizza was easily the tastiest part (and with good texture to boot).  I feel guilty as heck, but I had to throw the rest of that thing away.  Good pizza for Pittsburgh?  Maybe.  But at my ripe old age, I've been lucky to eat pizza in many cities.  Pittsburgh is not getting trounced only by Meccas like New York and New Jersey, but also cities as diverse as LA, Denver, D.C., Berlin, Baltimore, and even Cincinnati, Ohio.  There are many classic, wonderful things about Pittsburgh that should never change.  Its pizza is not one of them.",

    "text": "So, I'm giving this place 2 stars only because their pizza is sort of decent.  The first time I had the pizza, it was purchased by some of our vendors at my job.  They ordered a few different kinds - buffalo chicken, the ranchero, plain, and pepperoni.  I had a slice of the buff chick and a slice of the ranchero.  They were good, pretty tasty, and different from the usual.  I thought to myself, \"Cool! A new place to have lunch every now & then!\" So when a co-worker asked me if I wanted to order from Giovanni's for lunch, I jumped all over it. This time, however, I decided to go with the chicken tender salad.  Talk about a huge let down....  As soon as I was handed the salad, which was thrown together in a see-through container, I could tell it was going to be sub-par.  Ready for the lineup of thrilling ingredients?  It was 4 chicken tenders (probably once frozen) thrown on top a bed of iceberg lettuce, a few shredded carrots, about a half pound of shredded mozzarella cheese, 3 cucumber slices (1 of which was about as thick as a deck of cards while the other 2 were thin enough to see through), and, drum roll please, croutons which had absolutely no flavor.  These tasted \"homemade;\" and by homemade, I mean they were made from bread that was left out over night, and then torn up into chunks.  I can't quite find the words to describe this salad...it was just....gross.  I complained to a friend about how disappointing my salad was, and her response - \"Well, why would you order a salad from a pizza joint?\"  Well \"friend,\" how about don't put food on your menu that tastes like garbage (and then have the nerve to charge $11 for it). If you're going to have a food business, be proud of what you do and what you're making.  Anyhow, the pizza was decent...or maybe it just tasted better b/c it was free? I don't know...but what I do know is, I won't be ordering from here again.  I typically like to support local biz, but when you're serving me something I once ate at a grade school lunch (which was actually probably better than the salad I got here), don't expect to keep the customers coming back for more.",
