We ordered a few sushi rolls which were SO GOOD and very reasonably priced- and the soy sauce is homemade!   The staff was so friendly and attentive.  The outside of the place looks like any other asian restaurant, but when you go in the ambiance is very cool and modern.  Comfortable seating and new decor made for great experience.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

I decided to stop here for dinner even though sushi doesn't have many options when your vegetarian; what a great surprise!. The restaurant is small but nicely decorated. I had the spicy mango salad, tempura asparagus sushi and peanut/avacado sushi. Everything was amazingly delicious. The salad didn't skimp on mango and wasn't too spicy, but with a nice kick. The veggie sushi had really nice textures and mix of flavors. Would def recommend it and will def be going back soon!",

    "text": "Definitely recommended. A friend passed me a copy of the menu and I was impressed by the creative touch on many otherwise traditional (predictable? boring?) items - a bit of kiwi in a maki roll here, a honey emulsion sauce there. K Asian Bistro does a good job of tackling \"fusion\" without muddling the waters too much. The atmosphere had a little more 80's neon invasion than expected, but it's clean and spare, neat and modern. All of our food made the grade. We tried the Thai-type Tom soups, and both were fragrant and tasty. The Dinosaur Egg was a funny take on a Scotch egg, made with avocado and crab instead of sausage and egg. My Tokyo roll was wonderful, with perfectly cooked asparagus spears inside. The menu is pretty expansive, so it'll take a couple more trips to get a grip on their variety of items. The servers are incredibly polite, friendly, and even when service got a shade too busy, were patient and helpful. It doesn't look like much from outside, but this place is definitely worth checking out.",

This restaurant is located in a bland, nondescript shopping center anchored by Sears Hardware and Appliance on route 8, hardly a bastion of quality dining restaurants.  There is nothing on the outside that would indicate how modern and nice the restaurant is on the inside.    I had the Thai Basil chicken.  It was delicious.  It had just the right amount of spice - enough to give it a kick without it being overwhelming.  The chicken was moist and didn't have the dry, blandness taste.  I also had an a la carte roll of eel & avocado - also very good.  My mom had a mango chicken dish called Tropical Mango Sauce.  She is not one for exotic foods, but she loved it.    The service was the best part.  They were real friendly.  We never had to wait to have a service request accommodated.  The menu is rather large.  If your not into sushi, there is plenty of alternatives - lamb, chilean sea bass, rack of lamb, salmon, filet mignon, shrimp, and veggie options.",

We were seated immediately and ordered the crab spring roll appetizer which was quite tasty. But the sushi/sashimi dinner for two was truly a standout. The fish was VERY fresh and the rice was nicely cooked. Rolls (I believe they were dragon and volcano rolls) were delicious! The actual sashimi and sushi in the dinner was \"chef's choice\" and not specified on the menu but it was all high quality fish and no shrimp, eel, egg, etc. The restaurant is located in a strip mall on Route 8 so don't judge the book by its cover. It is BYOB but there is a wine shop a few doors down and we saw a group of diners near us enjoying a bottle with their dinner. I would highly recommend this place to sushi lovers in the North Hills, skip the places on McKnight Road and come here instead!",

And I don't know about you, but I loose track of the \"names\" of the \"days\" when I'm road tripping. Tip: check the paper at your hotel.   Our waitress pegged us as budget-conscious due to our interest in the bento box, so she steered us toward selections that would add up to a comparable price. We ordered the spring rolls (fried, delicious, yet small), and a chicken curry. I'm usually wary of curries at Japanese places due to it's over-sweet and goopy. Not the case here! The curry was light and spicy, the chicken tender, and the veggies fresh and crisp.   When we walked in, we were literally the only people there, but several tables seated while we ate. This was probably at 100pm on a Sunday. We didn't try the sushi, but for some reason I have a feeling it's decent.",

Also any thing from the sushi bar, I had the house special roll which was amazing. Also we sat close to the sushi bar and everything they prepared while we were there was looked beautiful.

The portions and price for both of our meals were right on.  On a Thursday evening, the place was pretty empty so getting seats shouldn't be an issue. I've never been there on a weekend though.",

I'm vary cautious when it come to raw fish because I eat a lot of it but feel vary safe eating anything off their menu. Most of their menu is good to me, but some are a hit and a miss like other restaurants. I especially love that you can get green tea ice cream there becayse it's almost impossible to get it in Pennsylvania. It's definitely worth a try!  Since eating here multiple times, I thought I should revise my review. Last summer my aunt Barb who lives in Japan came to visit. She said the miso soup they make is the best miso soup she had ever had and everything seemed really good. I was really surprised how much she liked it and how authentic she said it was. I thought she would think it was garbage compared to what they have at home but it surprised her.",

    "text": "Whenever I've driven along Route 8, fine sushi has not generally sprung to mind.  In between Eat n Park, and the myriad fast food restaurants, though, is nestled an unassuming door-front in a strip mall which delivers the most surprising culinary experience.  This restaurant - which seems never to be particularly busy - looks much like any other strip mall restaurant.  The room is functional, not opulent or stylish.  The lighting and music choices are not what you'd expect in one of the more high-end downtown restaurants.  But then the food arrives, and everything changes.  We have been there many times now (our young kids love it as well as the grown-ups).  Every time the service is friendly and efficient.  And the sushi is quite spectacular.  We moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco and this food would not be out of place there.  The fish is of a high quality, it's well-prepared and cut and always served at the right temperature.  We look forward to going there, the food and experience are consistently great, and the prices are reasonable.  I almost don't want to post a review, in case the place starts getting too busy!",

It is far and above one of the best asian restaurants I've been to, and definitely one of the best in the area. They feature lots of traditional as well as signature sushi dishes, as well as Thai and Indian as well. The menu features sushi but has plenty of other options as well.   The first time I went I had the honey walnut prawns. I expected three or four mediocre shrimp on a sea of rice. I was amazed when the dish featured 8 large prawns, perfectly coocked broccoli and artfully arranged honeyed walnuts. It was fantastic. Everything we've had there has been good to excellent.  The decor is also very tasteful - the neon is there but much more understated than other places.  It is on the small side but you can call ahead for a reservation.",

    "text": "Ouch.  Came in for lunch with my dad, for the $16 sushi/sashimi lunch special.  Oh man, I dunno what people are smoking, but the sushi here is really, really bad.  It's yet another fake-sushi restaurant with individually-quick-frozen and haphazardly cut assortments of fish served with bottled ginger, fake wasabi, and bland, watery soy sauce.  You know the type of place; they're everywhere!  They all taste the same and they all have basically the same menus.  Whatever, for $16 I'm not expecting them to fly in live scallops and shuck them right before the meal or anything, but I do expect the meager ingredients to be prepared well.  The miso soup was OK.  Nothing special, pretty much the same pre-packaged stuff you get at any of these kinds of places.  The sushi was really bad.  I know the fish was frozen, but it did not taste even remotely fresh.  It had a weird, mealy texture, the kind that results from, say, ice crystals forming and then thawing after the fish is RE-FROZEN.  Probably why it tasted slightly off, too.  The nigiri was completely screwed up.  The rice didn't seem like sushi, or even short-grained rice.  It was basically Chinese takeout rice.  Thus, it didn't stick together and when I picked up the nigiri, the rice just fell apart.  There was also FAR too much vinegar in the rice.  The spicy tuna roll was unremarkable, other than it being a complete waste of tuna, since all you can taste is the spicy sauce.  Which is probably a good thing here, since the tuna tasted pretty bad.  The sashimi was pretty much inedible.  The texture and flavor were just way off.  Every piece tasted pretty much identical.  There were 4 different kinds of fish but if I was blind, you could have fooled me.  I get this is Western PA and not the coast, but there are places that serve IQF fish competently and cheaply.  Even Giant Eagle sushi is better.",

It is not a sandwich at all and sounds a little crazy, but it is SO GOOD. It's sort of a roll...but not rolled. There are layers of rice and fish and it is just amazing with eggplant and lobster and I can't even remember what else is in it but it is sooo good.   Also it is BYOB and there is a liquor store next door and a beer distributor at the end of the plaza. Doesn't get much better than that!",

The interior is well decorated and wasn't tacky at all. It had a modern look with purple mood lighting. Tables were arranged side-by-side with a long bench against the wall and padded chairs on the other side of the tables, so you sit pretty close to other parties that are dining, but it didn't bother us much.    I had a volcano roll and my husband had the spicy tuna. We had no complaints. The rolls were a good size, well-prepared, and tasted good. We also ordered crab rangoons and pork pot stickers. Both were also very good. Prices were all very comparable to what you'd see at other sushi restaurants. I believe the spicy tuna was $6 and the volcano was $13.   Our only complaints are that the service was a little slow, which seems to be a popular complaint reading the other reviews. We were also surprised to see that there was a charge for refills on our receipt.",

Yes there are some bigger chain brands here and my favorite \"mom and pop\" place, but aside from that there isn't much variety, and that variety isn't very good. With that being said, K Asian Bistro breaks that mold and brings delicious food and a great atmosphere to the area!  I've only ever gone here for lunch but every time I have very much enjoyed it. The waitstaff is wonderful and comes around often to make sure you are doing good, drinks are full, and that any dishes or garbage(like a straw paper) is cleaned from your table. They really make sure that you have a great experience all around!  I usually will get a bento box lunch special. It comes with soup and salad to start, and the box has a California roll, your appetizer choice, meal choice, and rice. Their salad and soup is like any other hibachi place, with ginger dressing and miso soup. For the appetizer I normally get the edamame which is always good. I have tried the teriyaki chicken and hibachi chicken for the meal part and either are great! If you get the hibachi chicken it comes with their \"yum yum\" sauce which is super yummy! It does come with veggies too! I don't really like California rolls so I will give those to my friend I am at lunch with. I have tried their Dragon roll before and that was divine! They really do have good sushi from what I have tried there and around the area. Only quirky thing is they charge you for more than 1 refill on soda - so beware of that!  This place is worth the try if you are in the area. They have great food and it is something different!",

    "text": "There were two of us that rolled in and I went along because the other person suggested it. I was really hesitant because I'm judgy when it comes to sushi. We sat down and quickly scanned the menu, which was easy to read. The lighting was nice - not too dark and not loud. We had a waiter who was quick to fill out water and ask what we wanted to order. The person I was with had never tried sushi even though this place was his suggestion.  I ordered two pieces of salmon on rice and we each got an iron city roll. The salmon that came out was a generous piece and it definitely looked and tasted fresh. When the iron city roll came out, I first noticed how nicely it was plated. There was ginger and wasabi (I've been to places that don't include it). The roll itself had wasabi sauce on top so that helped make it extra spicy (yum!) and we both thought it was great. I'll definitely stop here again if I'm in the area.",

I think they cured the sashimi with salt instead of buying fresh fish. Long story short, if you are just looking for some Asian food, then sure it is fine.

The place was pretty crowded for a chilly Sunday night and we were seated right away.   We had no idea it was BYOB but quickly changed up our sake mindset to hot tea instead.  The tea had a really nice sesame flavor.    For dinner, we ordered up some King Salmon Sushi pieces and three rolls - a rainbow, an iron chef, and a paradise.  They were all pretty tasty but were cut into HUGE pieces that made it ridiculously impossible to eat in one bite or try and gracefully take half a bite using chop sticks.  Comical but sort of a put off because you want the full flavor of the components of the roll and not piecemeal bits and bites.  Our favorite was the rainbow roll.  The King Salmon was really terrific!  Try that for sure.   We may go back another time but, honestly, it didn't blow our doors off.  The service was fine but not very helpful.  We asked what the special rolls were and were told they are always they same, Ocean and some other roll name she rattled off and then scurried away.  Maybe she could have sold us more on what the rolls were or what she would recommend.  That would have been a better approach.  Give it a try.  Maybe it was just an off night.",

    "text": "To be honest, I had no idea this was called K Asian Bistro until I checked in on Yelp. I always assumed the logo was someone standing and throwing a boomerang.  Anyway, this place has a lot to offer, despite being nestled in a strip mall next to a Wines and Spirits. If I hadn't dined there before, I might be hesitant about eating at a place that looks kinda sketchy from the outside, but all of the sushi is made fresh and the prices are very reasonable. Basic sushi rolls run $5 or $6, and \"fancy\" ones are $10 to $12 per roll. My partner and I usually split two basic rolls and one signature roll.  Usually there aren't a lot of people here when we go, and service is fast and prompt. However, on Valentine's Day, it was packed. I should've known. Yes, it was crowded, but it took more than an hour for us to get our three rolls. No apologies. No other soups or finger foods to hold us over.  The thing that bothered me most was that it seemed like takeout orders were tripping up the servers rather than dining customers. Those orders seemed to take precedent. Staff would rush to prep things for orders and then sushi rolls and other orders would be sitting in a bag for several minutes until people came to pick them up. Two to three servers staffing the restaurant and handling takeout orders on a busy night just wasn't cutting it.  I think this was an unusual scenario, however, if it wasn't for this experience, I probably would have left a five-star review.",

    "text": "Located in a strip mall off of Rt 8 right next to Subway, K Asian Bistro doesn't look like much but this place has become my go to sushi stop in the North Hills.   Great for take out after a long day or for dining in, they have a diverse menu of sushi and non-sushi offerings.   My husband typically gets the fried rice and I go with a spicy rainbow roll but everything I've tried has been good and the fish is fresh.  I think their lunch specials are particularly reasonable and come with so much food that I normally have leftovers.   They are also BYOB and there is a state store in the same plaza in case you forgot to bring some wine.   The service has always been pleasant and fast.   Don't let the exterior deter you, this place is a hidden gem.",

There seems to be something for everyone, the tangy chicken has a slight crisp which is very pleasant and gives the feeling of fresh and home made. The udon is also very pleasant!   Granted the sushi *is* a bit pricey, rolls such as the paradise roll, which includes lobster and banana in a roll together, certainly are worth it.  The service is always amazing, the food does take longer than most restaurants, but it's nothing to complain about. The servers are always very nice and attentive, and if something isn't satisfactory, you can always let them know! They're more than happy to accommodate for anything  Additionally, they do take out! I wish they could do delivery as well to be honest.",
