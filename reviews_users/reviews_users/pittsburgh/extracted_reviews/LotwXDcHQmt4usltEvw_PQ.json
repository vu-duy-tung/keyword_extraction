Bad things: Staff seemed very disorganized (we had multiple people ask for our drink orders and it took a while for us to be seated despite the restaurant being only about 50% full). The waiters were also extremely unprofessional. We sat outside and about half way through our meal, a group of waiters came out for their break. Would not have been a big deal had they not been asking each other for weed, giving back rubs and making sexual jokes. No regard for the little boy at the other table who was also within ear shot. Our waitress was very nice but didn't seem to know the menu and not particularly attentive.   All of these would not be so surprising if it weren't a nicer restaurant. For their prices, we expected more professionalism.",

Bonefish is much more elegant inside than your typical chain eatery, but not so fancy that you can't just walk in from off the street...it is a chain after all. The must-try dish here is the Bang Bang Shrimp. Before trying the dish at Bonefish, I had made a similar copycat dish from Skinny Taste and it was delicious so I knew the real thing would also be good and I wasn't disappointed.  The shrimp are battered and fried and then coated in a creamy sriracha/spicy chili sauce and served on a bed of lettuce. It should be mandatory for any first time Bonefish diner to order these shrimp. SO SO GOOD!",

In other words, dont bring someone here if they dont like at least one type of seafood. Regardless i was able to order a burger, one of the only non-seafood dishes. For the record the burger was incredible (although kind of tricky to eat) and thats really why im giving it four stars. They had tvs so we could watch the steelers and bucs at the same time, which was cool. Prices were average, but definitely reasonable for the food. Although i cant personally attest to the seafood, i can say that every single person of my group (6 people) enjoyed their seafood. I did try the shrimp, which was actually really good although a little spicy. All things considered as a seafood restaurant, this one is really great. However, if you want anything besides seafood, youre in trouble.",

Well we had a drink and went outside under some sorta warm heaters - in was unseasonal, but it is still January! Long story short, they forgot is and deleted our reservation. I can't say enough to about Angela and Chris (management) and our server who took every opportunity to make their blunder up. Drinks were awesome, apps generous. And the shrimp and scallops that my daughter, daughters-in-law and I all ordered with varying sauces were grilled perfectly. The only drawback was, in an effort to get things rolling, our server did not mention any of the specials. I'll have to save those for a return visit.",

Our table was ready right as we finished our drinks so we thought we could just add the tab to our dinner but the bartender came to our table and explained they run on different servers so he took the credit card and walked it back to our table which was extremely nice and he gave no complaints or attitude at all. To start the waiter we had recommended a pineapple martini since I didn't know what I wanted. Let me tell you, it was delicious and I love a waiter/waitress that recommends their favorites. We got crab cakes for an appetizer which was delicious even though they fell apart very easily, also the dipping sauce is amazing. It's got a spicy zing to it but not too much where it over powers the crab. For dinner we both got the stuffed lobster which was a special. They were decently filled with crab meat, creamed spinach and some type of cheese. They brought actual butter to dip our lobster in and it was out of a metal holder with a candle underneath to melt it. Our lobster was very good but the meat was a little too chewy from being over boiled (the only complaint I have of this place.) For dessert we got the brownie with ice cream that had a raspberry drizzle. Perfect size to split and a great ending to our meal... You can't really go wrong with a brownie. I will definitely return and our customer service was excellent. Also fyi, they give you bread with this delicious oil and herbs instead of butter, it's to die for!",

We waited 45 min again and 2 customers that came in ten minutes after us were served their meals before us and had identical orders. The manager showed up to talk to us but only offered to take a small percentage off. This place used to be awesome when they first opened they had your food out within 10 minutes of you ordering it.

    "text": "Very disappointed  in the ongoing food quality and service level. I have been a weekly dinner customer of Bone Fish since it first opened. Although I have been a loyal and pleased patron ( would have rated 4 or 5 stars) from the beginning--  recent experiences have caused me to decide not continue my weekly dinners. Over the past 4 weeks I have noticed a decline in the quality of the seafood. Initially, I assumed my more recent experience with the poorer food quality  was simply a one- off and thought my next visit would be a better experience. It never happened. Something is very wrong with this place and this unfortunate trend in poor food quality has continued.This sense was corroborated by a recent visit when I took an out-of--town guest with me. My guest had to returned 2 not fully cooked seafood items. The resulting cooked portion was inedible! The manager and waitstaff were unapologetic and made no effort to address the circumstance. Last night was the final straw. I made advance reservations (I was put on hold for 5 minutes while the Bone Fish rep looked for a pen) and when I arrived they indicated they had no record of my reservation. They admitted the mistake and said they would seat me at the next open table. I waited and observed 5 groups be seated over the next 20 minutes. When I approached the front desk they again maintained they had no record of my reservation. I spoke to manager and described my situation. He had no interest in resolving my circumstance nor did he even offer an apology. Be assured I am done with this place.",

You can get an upscale meal as well as something as simple as a burger. Every time I go the wait staff is so accommodating and their fresh bread and pesto is my favorite! I like going for $5 martini Monday. As well as $6 bang bang shrimp Wednesday. If it's your anniversary you get a champagne toast. A birthday and you get a free dessert. They make special occasions special. The ambiance is both casual yet can be a great venue to get dressed up and celebrate a something or someone special.

Update: we were seated at 9:00.  It is now 9:45.  I've been here for an hour and a half and there has yet to be any food.  I'm starting to wonder if I've stumbled into some sort of odd, hidden camera social experiment.   Update: the food came!  Turns out they actually do have food here.  I was starting to suspect it was just a tastefully decorated lobby. The food looks mundane, but it's food.   Update: my tuna is overcooked and the whole dish is cold.  No big deal.  It's not like they specialize in preparing fish. My pregnant wife lost her appetite an hour ago so she's not loving this.    Conclusion:  reservations apparently don't mean the same thing in this alternate reality. Don't recommend coming hungry.  Your stomach will have plenty of time to empty.

I went to a Bonefish Grill ten years ago when I was in grad school out in Philly and always remembered thinking how good it was. When one came to McCandless, I kept telling my husband that we have go there, that he would love it. I wasn't wrong. We got ceviche as an appetizer - awesome. I got a scallop meal for my entree, he got ahi tuna - both awesome. They gave ciabatta bread with an oil dipping sauce - so awesome. The blackberry sangria I had might have been the best sangria I've ever had. And I would know. I love sangria, I get it everywhere. Really really dynamite food. And service.",

    "text": "This is my third or fourth time at this Bonefish, part of the Outback chain. Had a reservation on a Tuesday for 7pm, and arrived slightly early, and they seated me immediately while I was waiting for my dinner mate.  Since I'm trying to watch the carbs, thought this was a good place to pick, though I've never been bowled over by their food before. Our waiter was a bit over the top, not necessarily intrusive, more like too much \"bro-talk.\" What's up with waiters that think two gentlemen eating alone (myself and my son) need to approached with macho affirmations? The service was fine, if not a little annoying.  They started us out with a loaf of fresh-baked bread and butter, which my son tells me was quite good. We passed on their practically-shoved-down-your-throat Bang Bang Shrimp, and we started with the Ceviche, which was brought out simultaneously with my side caesar salad. The app consisted of pre-cooked shrimp and minced bay scallops in juice with \"fish (?), fresh pineapple, coconut, cilantro and guacamole.\" Truthfully don't remember the guac (it may have been there).  Pre-cooking the fish defeats the dish's purpose - it's supposed to be only slightly cooked, not tougher than it should be from cooking twice. It came with large tortilla-like chips. I ordered the rainbow trout, and though they tout several \"complimentary sauces,\" I decided since they hype that their \"market-fresh fish are cooked to perfection over a wood-burning grill,\" I went sans sauce, to be supposedly accompanied by a \"fresh-grilled lemon.\" Maybe the citrus fell off the plate on the way to the table. I chose spinach and broccoli for my sides - going for the green I guess. My son ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl.  The trout was not flaky at all, more like a nondescript, flavorless, mushy mess. The attached fins and skin DID alert me to what gave its life for me to eat only a third. The veggies were a bit overcooked, but acceptable. And my son said the Tuna Bowl was good, and the seared ahi was cooked properly.  All in all, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is adequate. I would give this maybe a half star over Red Lobster. I can't speak to their red meat entrees, but they have a wider selection of fresh fish and associated higher prices. But most likely won't go back on my own.",

When the plate arrived my sea bass was about as flat as a pancake and on the small side of the scale. The taste was good but was expecting that thick cut filet that one expects when ordering Chilean sea bass. I informed our server of my disappointment and was hoping she would have informed the chef or manager. No one came over to address my concerns. Needless to say I don't think we will be returning due to he lack of quality of food for the price that was paid.",

The menu has plenty of variety and offers types of fish that are rarely available at your local restaurants. Cooking fish is not easy and on our multiple visits we've noticed some difference in the quality of the cooking. But let's not have perfection be the enemy of the quite good. And quite good is exactly how I describe Bonefish. It's far-far superior to its only in-kind competitor, Red Lobster. The restaurant's decor and server uniforms are designed similar to high end steakhouses.  All in all, a great addition to our restaurant options.",

Everything else was just a tad off.  The potatoes were dry and the fish was about 2 minutes overcooked while the haricot vert, could have used about 2 more minutes of cook time.  The wait staff is knowledgeable, almost to the point of condescension.  I had to chuckle when I requested some butter for my beans and the waiter asked if I'd like cold or drawn butter.  Not having heard what he said, I said what? He began to explain what drawn butter was, when I only needed him to repeat what he said.  If you mention that it's your first time at Bonefish Grill, prepare yourself for a lengthy pitch on the history and quality of the establishment.  It's definitely worth a try, but expect to pay a little more than you would at Red Lobster.",

    "text": "Three stars? Really, if it were possible to bump it up to 3 1/2, that would be fair. First, let me say that fresh fish in Pittsburgh is always a good thing and reasonably priced fresh fish is a win!   Let's start with the cocktail. A Patron cucumber margarita on the rocks was beautifully presented in a salt and pepper rimmed glass. It was okay, but there was no discernable cucumber to it.   My dining companion enjoyed the always popular Bonefish classic, Bang Bang Shrimp - once again, beautifully presented. She really enjoyed the gentle heat at the end of each bite!  Chilean Sea Bass on the menu? My lunch decision was made, it's one of my favorite swimmy foods! With a choice of several sauces or toppings for the fish (as I recall maybe 5 or 6 options), I went with the mango salsa and a side of green beans. Chilean sea bass is normally a tall piece of flaky white fish, this didn't look anything like it should have. Instead, a thin slice - no more than 1/2\" high - sat on my plate with not a raw mango salsa, but more of a cooked mango, red pepper and onion sauce like no salsa I've ever encountered. A neat pile of green beans lay on the side of the fish. Presentation? Boring.   Taste? Okay, but overcooked...probably because of how the fish was cut. The mango sauce (not salsa) too sweet and gloppy for the fish. The green beans were nearly raw. The manager came to the table to ask how our lunches were. When I pointed out the way the fish was cut, he was surprised and said he was going to the kitchen to insure the fish would be cut properly. To be fair, this location just opened...perhaps the kitchen staff isn't yet up to snuff in how to cut various types of their product yet. The manager did comp the plate.  Dessert. Dear Lord, the Macadamia Flourless Brownie with vanilla ice cream was amazing! But, Bonefish is a sister restaurant to Outback...this is a sister dessert to the flourless brownie there. The macadamia nuts made it even better than Outback!  Would I go back? Sure! You're not paying for fine dining...it's a chain. The food is good (the brownie is excellent!), and the service is outstanding. Bonefish is a welcome addition to the North Hills dining scene. Just wish Yelp would allow me to give it 3 1/2 stars. Maybe my next visit will earn it a solid 4?",

The breading was falling off the shrimp before you even touch it, and the portion size has been dramatically reduced. My fiance got the teriyaki bowl with mango salsa. The mango salsa was a nice twist and  gave nice flavor but as my fiance put it \"nothing that she couldn't have gotten at the mall\". I got the special \"creole reddish\". The fish itself was good but the creole sauce and crawfish tails was disgusting. These are the types of places that give creole a bad name and puts people off to any creole meals because they don't have one ounce of knowledge on how to cook it., shout out to the cooks. We would come back for drinks but that would be it. Not worth the money for an upscale Applebee's.",

    "text": "First I would like to start by saying I have dined at Bonefish grill twice. My first experience I was pleased with so I returned again. If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would.   I ordered crab stuffed shrimp which was on their specials menu. The specials menu was not divided into courses (appetizers, entrees, etc), it just listed each dish out. At the very bottom it stated all entrees came with two sides. I was very excited for my meal and even when the meal arrived it was very tasty. Are you ready for the icing on the cake?   When my bill arrived I was surprised by the total because the price on the bill was not the same price listed on the specials menu. Let me just say I don't ever let prices steer me away from a meal. If the meal is worth it and I'm not blindsided the price doesn't matter. I questioned my waitress because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss something. She seemed annoyed by me questioning her and her response was the price listed on the specials menu is an appetizer price. How was I supposed to know that when at the very bottom of the menu it stated \"All entrees come with two sides\". Talk about misleading.   I went home and wrote to the corporate office to discuss my experience. Only because misleading menus lead to very unhappy customers and they should be aware of that. It said I would be contacted ASAP. An entire week goes by and I heard nothing, so I sent another message. It wasn't until that time that I was contacted by one of the local managers. I was given the apologies and I hope you will dine with us again speech that ended with I want to send you something in the mail. So I rambled off my address and waited for that something. It's been over 2 months and that something never arrived (not that it matters). My point in this whole review is, it's clear the customer service at Bonefish grill is terrible and I will never be returning. Thank goodness for Pinterest now I can make my own bang bang shrimp!",

    "text": "Came for brunch this morning with a group of people on reservation. I had no problem making the reservation or having checks separated. The greeting and wait staff were all super friendly.  I ordered the mimosa and the bang bang shrimp Benedict with asparagus.  I thought the food and drink were great, though I would have preferred a more traditional hollandaise sauce than the thick almost cheese-like sauce on the bang bang Benedict. Others who ordered traditional Benedict did appear to have the standard hollandaise sauce.  I will def come back and I look forward to trying dinner next time.  So I've been back to Bonefish twice since the original review above. Once was for brunch with a friend and I was advised they are not serving brunch any longer, despite the website stating they do. I got salmon and some veggies. Very basic, but it was def tasty.  The other time I went with a friend and ordered the Caesar salad, which was quite small and not exciting. I also ordered crab cakes which were a complete disappointment   not only were they very small, but they were also more like patties that would come from a non-seafood restaurant trying to serve something gourmet-ish.  Total fail for Bonefish.  I feel like their food is inconsistent and certainly not anywhere near as good as it was when I first tried them so many years ago. I may go back, hut only if others want to go there and nowhere else. Otherwise, there is far better quality only a few minutes away.  4/10/17 - UPDATE:  I've demoted Bonefish a point. I've been here a couple times now and find the food to be sub par quality at best and just lacking the atmosphere I remember from years ago. it wouldn't bother me to not come back again.  it's loud, it's uncomfortably hot, there's no ambiance at ALL, the table we got sat at was filthy, and the wait staff didn't know much about the fish being served.",

Being from the previous high expectations we had from that location, out family decided to visit this location to grab some late lunch. We arrived around 3:30 and there was very few people in the restaurant, so it would make sense that our service would be pretty quick. After placing our orders, our waitress brought at least 3 loaves of bread out to us and after about 25-30 minutes we finally received an appetizer. We then proceeded to wait another 45 minutes or more to receive our meals. The food was cooked well and tasted good, but for the time we waited it was not filling and everyone left still hungry. We then waited even longer to receive our check and went to the bar to pay and leave. For the price we paid, the service did not live up to those standards, and I don't see us returning there for quite some time.",

My friend got a dirty martini, which she really enjoyed. We shared the Mussels Josephine as an appetizer, it was absolutely delicious, both when i got it today and in the past. ALWAYS a must have! Plus it comes with enough to share. For my entree i got the Tilapia Imperial - it was a bit too cheesy for me, with barely any shrimp or scallops as promised. Id give that dish in itself a 6/10. They always give you bread which is amazing with the dipping oil. But most importantly, our server was very friendly and got back to us quickly with anything we needed. Overall a great restaurant each time I come. Would definitely recommend.",

We were seated next to the door where the servers came in and out (other tables were open) he came out all attentive then............ nothing ordered a wine 20minutes later it came we could see the bar/server area everyone was running and doing their jobs no sign of Bill, did comp that!Never got out bread plates, no water refills, never asked if meals was ok. Worse service ever.   The next day I went for lunch had Alex perfect server. Attentive and we had no alcohol orders but he was a perfect server and was treated accordingly.",

    "text": "This was our first visit to Bonefish Grill and I was pleasantly surprised.  The menu was great and the staff was very knowledgeable.  Our server Christine explained their restaurant concept without asking and mentioned her recommendations.  If a server eats at the restaurant it is a very good sign.  Each waiter/waitress also had a thermometer on them.  Our server was very efficient and had her act together.  We started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp as an appetizer.  They were good but the breading fell off of almost every one.  I have had different versions of breaded shrimp in a spicy cream sauce and the breading never fell off like this.  I believe the trick is to apply the breading, then cool them in a freezer for a few minutes.  After we ordered these they came out in literally 5-7 minutes.  Either they were made ahead of time or they are quickly made, skipping the chill process which may contribute to the breading mishap.  Despite the breading issue they were delicious.  4/5 stars  My girlfriend ordered the Blackened Baja Fish Tacos.  She said they were delicious but the Jasmine Rice was lacking any flavor whatsoever.  The tacos were spicy but offset nicely with the mango.  And it would have been nice to have more of the lime crema on them or on the side.  4/5  I ordered the Tilapia Imperial with Au Gratin Potatoes and Jasmine Rice.  The tilapia was cooked just the way I like it; crispy exterior but still flaked apart.  The shrimp/scallops/crab and lemon caper butter was average.  The Jasmine Rice was bland but some places server it like this.  I would recommend adding some kind of flavor to side.  4/5",

It was like he could not leave it alone. On with the review...we went on a Saturday for dinner so it was packed. We almost could not get in the door. It was packed. I will say make a reservation because we did and after we finally got to the hostess we were seated immediately. The wait for others, over an hour. We were greeted by a waitress who was nice but then she tagged out with the waiter who was not good. He spent what felt like 10 minutes explaining the menu and drinks and apps and everything in between. He kept repeating himself. We were annoyed. They were out of the sea bass which was a bummer. We ordered apps. Our friends got the steamed edamamme which was really delightful. We chose the fried calamari which was lightly breaded and fresh. For drinks... they rocked it! My friend got the apple martini which was really good but on the very sweet side. Her hubby got a mojito which was excellent. I got the raspberry martini and it was so fresh and delightful. So good I got another. For our entrees I got the swordfish with mango also and chose to add an upgraded side of smashed sweet potatoes. What I got was the swordfish special that came with pumpkin ravioli. The manager came over and apologized and they corrected it. I did eat the pumpkin ravioli and they were very good. The fish was very fresh which is terrific! My friend got a salad and noted that the dressing was water. Her hubby got steak and crab cake. It was a very thin fillet and the crab cake was small. My hubby got a steak and enjoyed it noting it was cooked as requested. We opted out of dessert. We could not take our waiter any more. He was very intrusive. Overall the food and drink was very good but the wait staff was not good!",

    "text": "This was my first time at the McCandless location.  For being a chain, ambience was nice.  We stopped for an early dinner on a Sunday, at about 4:00 so the place was not crowded and we were seated promptly.    Now I know everyone is in a hurry these days, so call me crazy, but I'm one of those people that likes to take my time when dining out.  It's an enjoyable experience for me.  I hate to be rushed, especially if I'm paying decent money for a meal.  From the second we sat down, I felt we were being rushed out the door.  Mind you, it was early...it's not like they needed to turn the table quickly or that the server was missing out on additional tips...there were still empty tables when we left.  I'll also add that if I'm taking my time I tip well to compensate for holding up turning a table.    They have a nice list of wines, beer and specialty martinis and other drinks.   I had time to read about 2 descriptions of drinks when the waitress (I'll call her Speedy) asked what we wanted, and we sent her away saying we needed a minute to decide.  I get it...some people get the same thing everywhere they go and know exactly what they want...I like to try new things so more than 30 seconds to browse the drinks would've been great.  She came back to get our drink order - the espresso martini was great - and at the same time she asked about an appetizer.  Ok, clearly we had looked at drinks only so far.  So we sent her away again to put the drink order in while we decided on an app.    They push the Bang Bang Shrimp.  I get it, people like it.  Speedy said 9 out of 10 tables order it!  Alright!  But popcorn shrimp drowned in a mayo/hot sauce mixture doesn't do it for me.  So I'm a rebel, what can I say.  Went with calamari.  Mostly very good, light breading, not greasy, the larger pieces were a bit rubbery.  Loved that they breaded the strips of peppers that came with it.    Of course when she took the app order she also asked if we were ready to place our dinner order...ok, again, we just looked at apps...didn't look at dinner options yet.  Sent her on her merry way again.  We will give you our dinner order when you bring our app, Speedy.    Ordered the special day boat scallops over corn risotto with green beans.  The scallops were cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful.  The risotto was good but needed just a little more seasoning.  Green beans were good, presentation was nice.  My dinner mate ordered the walleye which she said was very good and fresh.    We were disappointed when we were done eating and we heard Speedy offer the table behind us bread and dipping oil....we were offered none.    5 stars would've been given, as we enjoyed the food and drink, but the rushing me out the door gets under my skin.  This is not the only place it happens, and it especially happens at chains.  I wish servers would try to get a feel for the type of dining experience people are looking for...maybe asking a question as simple as \"are you in a hurry tonight?\"",

We ordered the filet mignon which was tender but devoid of any seasoning, served with lobster tail that was rubbery and served with melted, flavorless butter. The vegetable sides--asparagus and broccoli--were both over cooked. Truly a letdown. When I asked the waitress for another try at the asparagus she returned with over cooked breaded asparagus. Won't be back.",

    "text": "So what makes a restaurant stellar versus okay?  Is it the food?  The ambiance?  The combination of food and ambiance or some other factor that's hard to define?  I have been to Bonefish Grill in different iterations in different cities and I have to honestly say that it's not rocket science as to the appeal of this restaurant.    During my most recent visit in McCandless, our hostess was extremely pleasant, we didn't have a wait during our seating and our waiter was extremely jovial.  The decor was pleasant and the menu was pretty straight forward.  I have spent more money on so-called \"stellar\" restaurants and been dissatisfied with my experience. (Experience in this case being the culmination of food, service, decor, etc.,)  I have to honestly say that I was pleased with my \"experience\" at Bonefish Grill.  I ordered the Corn Chowder + Lump Crab as my appetizer and my sister ordered the popular Bang Bang Shrimp.  For our main courses, I ordered the grilled Scallops and Shrimp, my daughter Muff ordered the Creme Brulee French Toast with bacon and my sister ordered the Atlantic Salmon.  Both my sister and I ordered the steamed broccoli and Potatoes Au Gratin as our sides.  We thoroughly enjoyed our warm bread and seasoned olive oil precursor before our meal.  All of our food was properly cooked and served at the proper temperature, the service was extremely friendly and welcoming and we enjoyed our experience.  Is it cutting edge food and service?  No!  Did the staff deliver what Bonefish Grill promised?  Absolutely!  I had a good meal at a restaurant that promised a pleasant experience and that's what I got.  I have been to \"quote, unquote \"cutting edge\" restaurants that seemed to expect me to grovel because I was  \"allowed\" to enter their golden edifices that claimed a dedication to providing the best food experience possible only to feel like Schlepprock!     Bonefish Grill is a good, solid seafood restaurant that delivers on providing flavorful food in an atmosphere where you can count on great service.  Who can ask for more at the price point that they offer?",

After her mistake and blatant rudeness one would apologize, right?!  Wrong! My review would be: UNDERWHELMED",

The portion was so large I thought they gave me a tilapia filet by mistake! The cod was nothing special in flavor but it was cooked properly. I had steamed spinach as a side but I didn't like that it was sitting in a pool of water. The garlic mashed potatoes were the highlight of the dish.  Overall it was a positive experience.

    "text": "One of my favorite lunch destinations and so this review is based on my lunch experience alone. This location is convenient to the many errand spots and stops one must accomplish during the day so I usually feel somewhat rewarded when Bonefish Grill ends up being the last stop over my lunch break.  My first impression while entering through their revolving door was that this place feels smooth and looks inviting.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess and then were led through the warmly lit dining room to the most comfortable, cushiony booth ever!  The dining room was fairly busy with an active lunch crowd yet I quickly noticed how pleasantly peaceful the sound level was even with all the conversations around me going in full tilt.  How relaxing and refreshing not to have to shout to your dining partner.  We were warmly greeted by our server who was wearing a very nicely pressed professional looking waiters jacket as did the other servers and bar staff. Nice touch.  While glancing through the menu I immediately realized that an overabundance of delightful choices lie ahead of me!  Not your same old same old lunch options at all.   Great appetizer listings include things like the Bang Bang Shrimp, PEI mussels, lamb lollipop chops, fresh oysters and much more. There are soups like lobster bisque, or corn chowder and lump crab. The menu also features wedge salads, cobb salads, cilantro lime shrimp salad, Fresh fish of the day, Sandwiches such as BFG fish, Kobe beef burger, Bang Bang Shrimp tacos.  Too much to list but if choosing is hard to do then there is always the lunch combo.  The lunch combos allow you to go with a soup and salad, or the soup or salad and wrap, or soup or salad and soft tacos and are all under $10.00.  All in all lunch at the Bonefish Grill is a first class experience at an affordable price.",

It was so over cooked. Their seafood is always so good, but they shouldn't offer steak if they can't cook it. This is the first time either, my son ordered a steak, returned it because it was severely over cooked, the next one they brought out was rare.",

    "text": "Still so many kinks to work out... But the mere fact that bonefish is now open is a plus. Service is good but not quite polished yet. There were a few hiccups during our meal but overall it was a pleasurable experience.  It was Halloween night and they were offering their three course special. We had the bangin shrimp, which was really tasty and a good portion size for the price. Husband got the rainbow trout, I was getting the tuna steak. After about 15 mins, I was informed they had sold out of the tuna steak. The kitchen may want to communicate to their servers when they sell out of something In a timely manner. I opted for the tuna bowl...  Husband was not too pleased his trout came with the skin on and didn't find the fish to be flavorful. I was very disappointed with my tuna bowl. Almost inedible. The \"seared\" tuna that was supposedly rolled in sesame seeds was not warm at all and literally tasted a bit frozen in the middle. Not pleasurable at all. I looked around and noticed the lady next to me happily eating her tuna bowl, so it might just have been my meal... I'm sad nonetheless.   We will probably come back again as bonefish is a solid place to go, but we will go back after they work out their kinks.",

I was very hungry and wanted a large portion of food, so I ordered the Alaskan Cod Fish & Chips. The only complaint I have was that the breading on the fish seemed to absorb an excessive amount of grease. Perhaps the fryers weren't on high enough? Other than that, it was your basic fish & chips.   I'm not a very big fan of chain restaurants as I feel they sacrifice on quality, natural ingredients because they're trying to cut costs. I'm a big fan of farm-to-table, so that's why Bonefish only got 3 stars.",

I got the Caesar (a little heavy on the dressing but otherwise very good) and the bang bang shrimp tacos. They were delicious. Right amount of spice, not selfish on the shrimp. Will definitely return for that deal.   I was given a gift card to Bonefish Grill so I suggested this location for a night out with friends. It was a Saturday so I made a reservation and my table was ready when I arrived very early. I ordered wine and enjoyed the bread while waiting for my group. The wine selection was pretty good and my friend found her very favorite Chardonnay. I got one of the specials, a seafood risotto. Honestly, it was a bit bland. The creme brulee for dessert was SO good though. Lots of vanilla flavor in the custard. The waiter was very patient with us as we sat and talked for far too long - 4 hours in total! We basically stayed until they closed. Nobody made us feel pressured to go and that was quite nice.",

They greeted us quickly and gave us some warm crusty bread with dipping oil and herbs which paired nicely with our wine.  Lunch was with a dear friend and we planned on a nice long catch up.  Our waitress was attentive and did a nice job for the most part.  There were only six or ten tables the entire time we were there so it wasn't busy by any stretch which may explain why she kept asking us if we were okay ... it sort of got irritating after the eighth time.  I think, because we were there for several hours, she wanted paid so we paid up and sat around for another hour.    The food was really delicious.  I had the crab dusted cod in the lemon butter sauce with au gratin potatoes and fresh green beans that was just perfectly cooked.  My friend has the health salad with grilled salmon that was terrific too.    I like that it's on the upper scale with white linen tablecloths and attentive service but you'll pay a little more which is totally reasonable to me.  Check it out for lunch!",

    "text": "I recently checked out bonefish grill for brunch with my boyfriend. I've had bonefish down in Virginia and absolutely loved it so I was excited to finally check out the Pittsburgh location.   We started off with a order of the shrimp because I remembered how delicious it was last time I had it. Definitely one of my favorite items. The right amount of breading and just enough spicy mayo to give it just enough kick. I also ordered a mimosa which I could tell was clearly homemade. If you aren't a fan of pulp in your orange juice I would not recommend this mimosa for you.  Everything else on the menu looked delicious but I always end up going with eggs benedict if it's offered. Sadly this eggs benedict left me very disappointed. The eggs were very rubbery and it just didn't taste good overall. As you can see from the photo they don't look all that appetizing either. Not sure what their recipe for hollandaise sauce is but they should probably work on it.   While my experience definitely left me disappointed and fell short of my expectations I would like to come back for dinner some time. I've heard good things from friends and I remember loving the fish tacos last time I had them.",

My husband and I were seated in the bar half of the restaurant at one of the high top booth tables. I didn't like how close we were to the people on either side of us. I could hear their entire conversation as if I was sitting with them.  Our waitress was very kind, although she became less attentive as the night went on. I'm sure that was just because they had a lot of people sitting around our area so she had a lot to do.   We had the calamari to start, and it was absolutely delicious. I had the crab cake and steak for dinner with a side of mashed potatoes and the bacon Mac and cheese. The crab cake was good but very small - about the size of an air hockey puck. The steak was not cooked to the degree that I had asked but it still tasted good. The sides were both delicious! Next time I go, I'll probably stick to appetizers and side dishes because they were so much better than the main dish.   All in all, it was a fine experience and I would go back. I don't think I'd with in the bar area again unless I was sitting at the actual bar.",

He should be your trainer as your receptionist and her crew were rude.  Lindale was good enough to keep the rating at 5 for service. FOOD- 3 STARS. My shrimp and scallops charcoaled dish was very unsatisfactory.  The Shrimp and scallops were both wet and soggy.  Yeas it had a sauce on it but sogginess was the meat.  Not firm as it should be.  Did I complain, no, because it was a birthday meal and didn't want to \"mess it up\". The bang bang shrimp was good.  My wife was looking for a plain chicken dish like she had before but not there.  In its place was a single chicken fru fru dish. Hey, it is partially our own fault.  We know that Bonefish is mostly for \"fish lovers \".",

He also thought the rum and coke was very good, especially for $5.50.  I had the corn and crab chowder which was fine, and the shrimp and scallops which were very good. I had garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, which I think was actually local, because it was very green and thin stalks, not the giant out of season pale green garbage you get sometimes.   We cleaned our plates, plus finished off two servings of bread. It comes with olive oil and either basil pesto or chimichurri type stuff mixed in. The olive oil isn't the best, but got the job done.   No desserts this time, but the strawberry shortcake did sound good.   Our server, Paige, was super attentive and polite. And there are food runners, so everything came out in a timely, but not super rushed, manner.   This was a pleasant surprise, especially for my non seafood eating partner. We'll definitely be back.",

Everything we were served was of top quality, in freshness and preparation.  Just for the food I would highly recommend it.  But even more than that what I want to highlight here is the rest of the experience.  Basically, after waiting for 45min for a table (place was busy as you would expect on a Friday evening before the Valentine's day), and another 45 min for the food, we found that they were out of one of our orders.  Normally , something like this would be enough to walk out, never to come back again.  But there is something about how they treat the customers.  The person serving the table was so polite and caring that it felt like this was a case of genuine situation resulting from an unexpected demand on a busy evening than just careless planning on their part.  It was further evident when the managing partner, Brian Fischer, came three times to talk to us and was extremely apologetic about the whole incident and was trying his best to comfort us.  He never made any excuses and said he would fully understand if we never wanted to come back.  What had the potential of ruining my nicely planned evening with my wife, ended up being just fine, with great food, and great attention and service.    In trying to make up for the inconvenience, Brian offered to waive the charges for the meal with additional free coupon.  While I would have been fine without any of that (and I told hime so) it just went to show that he genuinely wanted to right the wrong.  Basically, this is a truly classy place that serves fabulous food and cares for their reputation and hence their customers.  I will strongly recommend it and will visit it again myself, especially to try the stuffed tilapia - their supposedly the best dish on the menu - that we missed yesterday.",

I took my parents out to dinner; during the 20-minute wait for a table, we got drinks at the bar. They have the most miniature Moscow Mule mugs I've ever laid eyes on, BTW. When our table was ready, I sent my parents on their way and tried to flag down a bartender to take care of our tab. The bar was far from full, but both bartenders did that thing where they walk past but carefully avoid eye contact so they don't have to deal with you. The guy knew we were waiting for a table - why so hard to take care of the tab? Then finding my parents was an ordeal. The two girls at the hostess stand were too engrossed in conversation to point me on my way. When I finally joined my parents, my dad said he had specifically told the girl who seated them that I'd be following after I paid the tab. Maybe so much time had passed that they forgot? Our waiter was over-the-top enthusiastic, perhaps to make up for his space cadet coworkers. Overpriced, mediocre food in a cringe-inducing atmosphere - I won't be back.",

I do have to give them props for promptness now, though.  Our food came out 13 minutes after we ordered.  Also, we made a reservation, and despite the place being packed, we were seated within 10 minutes. I had the shrimp pad thai.  Meh.  Only about 6 rather small, tasteless shrimp, and a TON of rice noodles.  No peanuts, either, as per the menu.  I guess they ran out of peanuts. Wife had the lobster tail; she said it was good. We shared the coconut pie for dessert.  Honestly, I'd rather have a slice of coconut cream pie at Eat 'N Park. Had to track down the waiter to get a drink refill. It was interesting to note, as we were sitting there, we had TWO passerby customers offer us their extra $10 off coupons.  Does everyone in this place have a coupon? Plan to give them a 3rd try.  I'll order yet something different. To anyone who thinks their Bang Bang Shrimp is the greatest thing since sliced bread, here's a tip:  make your own at home.  Go to Wholey's and get yourself a bag of GOOD shrimp, then find the copycat recipe online.  A lot cheaper and a WHOLE lot better.  I have ordered shrimp dishes on both of my visits here, and my personal opinion is the quality of the shrimp could be a LOT better.",

It was like the forgot the customers who were patiently waiting and only seating online reservations. This was extremely frustration considering we were waiting at the bar, ordering $8 beers, and customers who did not spend a dime yet were getting seated. I expressed my frustration to the manager, telling him we've waited over an hour and spent $40 on drinks, and were basically ignored. They ended up having a table for us all of the sudden and offered us a complimentary appetizer. As soon as we sat down the waiter told us the kitchen was behind and we would be waiting a little longer than normal for food. The managers shifted had ended and he failed to tell our waiter about the complimentary appetizer and we ended up paying for the appetizer that we only ordered because the manager said it was complimentary. The food was just average, the drinks were very over priced, and the overall experience was poor.  Not the type of service you would expect from an established upper end franchise.

We decided to stay and have our meal here. Every staff member I came in contact with was friendly and smiled. EVERY staff member. That, to me, is huge and unfortunately rare anymore but it makes a very big impression. We enjoyed the bang bang shrimp and calamari as appetizers. Both were cooked to perfection and served hot. The fish tacos were my favorite and all of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Although full, dessert was reluctantly ordered. Oh my, flourless macadamia nut brownie with vanilla ice cream, this dessert was worth the gorge! We will definitely be back but will probably try a reservation next time.",

    "text": "Highly anticipated coming here for dinner. I love wood fired foods and this new restaurant seemed like a good choice. Maybe it was the timing, but the place was overcrowded with no room to wait even at 8pm on a Tuesday. The hostess said a community table option might be faster. There is no good reason for a community table, it cheapens the atmosphere and in effect makes you feel looked down upon. Service was rude, bare minimum level. Food was not very exciting, tiny steak had to be sent back due to it being very overcooked. Mashed potatoes had way to much garlic in them, and the dessert (coconut pie) was not good at all. I watched two couples leave after their food took almost two hours to arrive. To put the cherry on top of this review, how would you feel if the people who sat next to you were served by your waitress first after you had already put your order in ten minutes before? Do not go here, there are too many clones of this kind of restaurant that do it better.",
