    "text": "Good Mexican food.   I came here with my colleague/friend on the July 4 long weekend while visiting Pittsburgh. Decided to try the place before we headed out for clubbing on South side.   The portions are pretty generous for the price, atleast coming from NYC feels the portions are good and without compromising on the quality.   The sauces are pretty good. The chips we had ordered were too oily. Mentioned it to the partner/hostess and she was apologetic saying they make it fresh and the person in kitchen might not have rested it to let the extra oil drain.   Verdict - A good Mexican place on South side. Definitely worth vist(s)",

I've had their tacos and empanadas on several occasions and they are quite delicious. The empanads have a crispy, flaky crust that is cooked perfectly. My friend tried the special one day which was a sausage and fried plantains...she loved it. They also have mexican coke, which I love!  I've always been too full to try their dessert options, but I bet they're good too!",

Less snazzy than the tacos you might get at Tako or SMOKE, but honestly I would prefer these tacos. Even better than Las Palmas, my other favorite in the burgh. They also had awesome guacamole, and our server was very nice and attentive. My family tried the vegetarian fajitas, flautas, and tilapia and there were rave reviews all around. It is a small place and it is BYOB. They have a margarita mix pitcher if you want to bring your own tequila (wish I knew this before hand!!).",

    "text": "La Palapa offers incredible authentic Mexican food conveniently placed right on East Carson. Truthfully, I have driven past this place so many times without even knowing it was there. This place was recommended to me by a friend so I decided to check it out.  The place is BYOB, which I like a lot. The restaurant itself isn't very big but seems more than accommodating for larger parties. The atmosphere is bright with artwork on the walls.  Our server was attentive and helpful with any questions we had. She even put our bottle of wine in their freezer since it wouldn't fit into the chiller they provide.   The food was awesome! We started with chips and guacamole; the chips were fresh and crisp, the guac was light and full of flavor. I ordered the chicken flautas which were delicious. The portion was very generous and included rice and beans (or the option of rice and vegetables) that complimented the meal very well.   It seems like they do well with take out, two orders stopped in while we were there. The night we went it was snowing pretty bad out, there was only one party there besides us so I'm not sure how busy this place gets on a typical night.   All in all, I would most definitely go back and recommend this place to others!",

    "text": "Man....I was so excited to try this place two weekends ago and we never actually made it until this past Saturday night.  I think I had much different expectations about this little spot in SouthSide.  I give 3 stars for the great service and the OK food.  First - the location & atmosphere:  It is small and on 19th street. Parking was easy to find and when we walked in Bobby had mentioned it used to be an old Thai place.  The decor wasn't anything fancy- It was small and very casual.  There was a large group of maybe 8-10 people next to us using most of the tables, then maybe two other couples.  We grabbed a seat by the window.  I think this place would be better as a lunch spot rather than a Saturday night BYOB dinner spot.  The service: We had three people waiting on us. One took our drink orders and opened our wine/brought out the glasses.  A woman was taking our orders and was a server in training and had someone showing her the ropes.  Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. They took good care of us without being overbearing or annoying which I always appreciate.  Finally, the food:  We ordered chips and pico plus guac.  The pico, per our server's suggestion, was very good.  The guac was good but lacked a little flavor (garlic? lime? salt? I don't know).  The chips were fresh and not greasy but they literally broke into a million pieces every time you took a bite! I made a mess of course.  Bobby ordered the seafood stew as his dinner and said he very much enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavors and a lot of different types of seafood.  I ordered their special - the chicken sopes.  The chicken and toppings seemed fresh but pretty bland.  The base was dry and didn't have much flavor.    I would go back and try this place again and then hopefully update the rating/review.  Bobby really enjoyed his and would give it 4 stars he said, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.",

    "text": "We went here last week on a chilly weeknight for some decent Mexican food. I've been here before. Coming from the Southwest, passable Mexican food is very difficult to find here and La Palapa delivered. We got a handful of items and shared and enjoyed all of it with some minor gripes. The food is Mexico City-style Mexican food so its a bit different than the Sonorran style that I am used to.  We started the meal with chips and guacamole. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, they do not offer complimentary chips and salsa, which we found odd. But the guacamole was great. Billed as \"best in the city\", I would have to disagree. Mine is slightly better but the guacamole is great. There were a couple of the little black/brown stem thingees in the guacamole. The chips were really oily, though. Which was a bummer. We were there to pig out, though. So we dabbed off the oil and enjoyed the appetizer.  I ordered the Chuletas de Puerco which is a big pile of pork chops and potatoes plus rice and beans. They smothered it in a salsa verde (green sauce). The pork chop did have bones and with all the sauce, its hard to see where the bones and gristle end and where the tasty pork chop begins. The beans were awesome and the rice was fluffy with corn mixed in. The salsa verde wasn't spicy at all and I had to douse the whole thing in some heat. Not a big deal, I understand the typical Pittsburgher is a total wuss when it comes to heat so they have to make it to taste.  My woman ordered a couple chicken quesadillas and I order a chicken tamale for us to share. They also provided a small tortilla warmer with some deliciously soft corn tortillas (my favorite). They were great to sop up the various sauces. Her quesadillas were fairly small but the chicken tasted pretty good. They came with the guacamlole, crema fresca and a pico de gallo on the side.   No horchata for the night and they were out of Sprite. But my woman ordered a Mexican Coke. She had to ask for a cup of ice, even though the Coke was warm. The water also had very few ice cubes in it and, by the end of the meal, the ice had all melted. Maybe they didn't think we needed ice, with it being so cold outside. Or maybe they just have a drastic ice shortage in the restaurant.  The biggest negative was that the table size is peculiarly tiny! We ordered one entree and a few small things and, with beverages, hot sauce and tortillas, we had to stack things in order for everything to fit. The tables are pretty much large enough for a two beverages, two entree plates and maybe a squeezed in tortilla warmer where you can find room. That coupled with the oily chips, stems in the guacamole and the lack of ice put a damper on the meal.  The food tastes great. But the delivery seems to be lacking.",

On Tuesdays however, IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS FOR THREE TACOS. How amazing is that?! You can also get three different types of tacos, which is always fun. I usually get chorizo and potato, pulled pork, and chicken.   The restaurant itself is small. It's cute in a very family owned way--it's not exactly modern, but it works because then the focus is on the food.   It's also BYOB, and they serve a non alcoholic margarita mixer.

The quesadillas and the guacamole are fantastic. But the ambiance is lacking. The tables on the patio don't match and it looks like a bit of a mish mash of old and poorly arranged furniture. Our food came out so quick that it was before our beers, which isn't great business practice to get people to stay for a second drink with dinner. Next time I think I'll order takeout, but I hope they step it up because this place has potential!",

This city definitely lacks authentic Mexican restaurants, and having seen reviews of La Palapa as well as tasted some of their items at the Yelp Halloween event, we decided to give this a try. I was thrilled to know they have Mexican flavored soda (Jarritos). I got a order of guacamole with chips as an appetizer. My only complaint is that the chips were really oily!  But the guac was fresh and extremely flavorful. Then I got the enchiladas with green sauce for the entree. Oh man, I was so impressed! I absolutely loved the green sauce, which tasted so delicious and mildly spicy. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I really enjoyed this dish! The waitress was friendly and genuine! The place is BYOB, but there aren't a dearth of bars just around the corner. Overall enjoyed the experience and would go there again.",

It was a great day and we got a nice table at their covered outdoor area. The margaritas on special were good.. came in a plastic cup though. The guac is made right at your table. Some find that really cool, I find it gimmicky. The guac is nothing fancy, just your regular guac ingredients, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapenos and lime but yummy! I also ordered the veggie stuffed peppers and a veggie empanada both of which were excellent. The stuffed pepper appetizer is highly recommended! We ended with their tequila cake which is a tequila infused tres leche. It tasted like a regular tres leche with no sign of any tequila infusion but tasty nevertheless! For vegetarians especially, La Palapa is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city and I'll definitely be back here again!",

    "text": "I first experienced La Palapa in small quantities at a couple yelp events in Pittsburgh Public Market- I was super excited to check out this adorable little restaurant and try some full size options!  My sister and I visited on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00- there were a few parties in the small restaurant, allowing us to have plenty of options on where to sit. We chose a cozy little table next to a window, so we could people watch (who doesn't love that?!). First off, our server was ADORABLE. He was super helpful, in a great mood and just made the experience that much better by his wonderful attitude.   I was curious about the horchata, so he let my sister and I sample it before making up our minds. After trying one sip, I knew I had to order it- it was amazing! Really refreshing. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a beef taco, my sister ordered one chicken and one cheese quesadilla. I was given two tacos- one chicken and one beef. Not a big deal.   The tacos were HUGE. PACKED with meat and served with guacamole, lettuce and salsa. The chicken was awesome- it was shredded, juicy and full of flavor. The guac was amazing and so was the salsa! Our server asked if we wanted hot sauce, and of course we did. WOW. It was a home made green sauce and full of flavor. It added a really tasty kick to the tacos. My sister loved her quesadillas and loved the hot sauce with them as well. I wasn't so crazy about the beef taco- the meat just was a little flavorless to me and it was almost too much meat. I couldn't finish it at all.  The horchata went PERFECTLY with the tacos. The creaminess of the horchata really cooled my mouth down, which was awesome.   You can't beat the prices of this place- the quesadillas and tacos are a little over $3 each.. making them a steal! I have been to tons of taco places in which I needed four to feel full. One and a half tacos from La Palapa and I was STUFFED.  Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!",

I wasn't sure if we could reserve tables because it's a smaller dining area but they did reserve tables for us. Their was even another group that was our size that had reserved tables. We were all lively and chatty but it didn't seem loud or chaotic.  We started with chips, guacamole, pick, and verde. I had never had verde served warm with chips but it was really good. The pico and guac were on point as well.  I ordered Flautas y Pollo. Flautas are like small tacos filled with chicken, steak, or pork. They are rolled up and deep fried. My order came with 4. They were chicken (Pollo). They were stacked nicely and were served with a little bit of sour cream and a big spooning of guacamole. The Flautas were crispy on the outside but on the inside the chicken was tender and juicy. On the side were pinto beans and rice. The portions were big!  We were talking and eating and enjoying ourselves. Our server was very nice and did a great job with our group. The birthday girl walked away with a big smile on her face and a tummy full of great Mexican food.",

    "text": "Who would've thought that delicious authentic Mexican food could be found in a tiny little hole-in-the-wall joint in the Southside?  I've been wanting to go to this place since seeing some of the reviews on Yelp (thanks Yelpers!), and it did not disappoint. As mentioned, this is a hole-in-the-wall, but in the best possible way -- cute, cozy, unpretentious, and not dirty or outdated. It only has like 7 or 8 small tables, but it was not at all busy when our group of 4 went on a Sunday evening. We were the only non-Spanish-speaking customers in there at the time, which I was hoping was a good sign with regards to the food's authenticity.   Their menu is smaller than some of the other typical Mexican places around the 'Burgh that have, for example, 17 pages of Combos #1-100 to choose from. I think this is a good thing, because it means that they can focus on a few dishes and do them well. La Palapa's menu covers most of the Mexican basics -- tacos, tortas, tamales, quesadillas, flautas, burritos, enchiladas, etc., along with churrasco meats. Note that unlike at most other Mexican restaurants, you will not get free chips and salsa to start here. Maybe that speaks even more to the restaurant's authenticity...do they serve free chips and salsa at restaurants in Mexico? I've never been to Mexico, so I have no idea, but free chips and salsa totally sounds like an American thing to me. I digress...  I opted to get the mole poblano con pollo with pinto beans and vegetables (subbed for rice). It was simply delicious. You can tell that this food is fresh, homemade, and prepared with care. The chicken breast was succulent and so tender that it easily fell apart when cut with my fork. The mole sauce was slightly sweet and warmly spiced, although not hot spicy. They do have squeeze bottles of a very hot homemade green sauce (similar to the green sauce served at Chicken Latino) that you can add to your dish to kick up the spice intensity if you wish (which of course I did!)  The pinto beans that came as a side were very flavorful and well-seasoned, as were the vegetables (a mixture of fresh zucchini, squash, carrots and spinach).   My dining companions each ordered various items (tacos, enchiladas, tamales), and everyone was equally impressed with their food. I had a bite of my husband's poblano tamale and it was to die for. Also, their tacos are enormous! Along with the tamale, my husband got a chorizo taco and immediately had to knife-and-fork it because it was so big. One of our friends got a chicken taco and attempted to eat it the normal way, but had to give up because there was just so much filling. So they definitely don't skimp on the portion sizes here. Delicious food and a good value -- a rare combination these days!   Service was fantastic. We had the sweetest server who was very attentive in filling our waters, checking in to see how we liked the food, clearing our dishes, etc. It's also BYOB, which is awesome (although we did not take advantage of this -- next time!)  Seeing as La Palapa shines in service, food, and value, this will definitely be my new go-to spot for Mexican. Cheers amigos!",

The chips and salsa are $3.50 but worse than most free ones..the rice is plain white, beans straight from can, meat quality cheap, no flavor and nkt fresh taste, and cheese from a shake can taste and cheese in enchilada taste like string cheese.advertised as gormet Mexican..far from it.

    "text": "This review is not for the brick and mortar restaurant, but for the taco cart they use on the road.   I seriously think these tacos rival that of las palmas. There is finally another street food taco vendor that does good tacos !!  They had a deal running: 1 item for 3.50 or 3 items for 10.00. You could choose from tacos, quesadillas, or empanadas. The fillings for the tacos and quesadillas were chicken, pork,  chorizo , and beef while the empanadas has all the same options minus the chorizo and sub cheese & plantains.  They also served the staple Jarritos pop in the glass bottles and Mexican coke.   The tacos were a hefty size but I was disappointed to see that they were filled with rice underneath of the chorizo. The chorizo has potatoes sauteed in with them which I thought was a great touch, but the rice was truly overkill.  Much like Las Palmas, there is a small condiment bar. No limes, but pico de gallo, onions, cilantro, and squeeze bottles full of Mexican cream and hot sauce. I found the hot sauce to be a bit milder, but others may not be able to handle it. No limes for these delicious tacos, but honestly there was so much flavor it wasn't all that noticeable.   The empanada was fried up fresh, AND they used homemade corn tortillas, just like a pro!!   The price point (3.50 for ONE taco???) and rice in the taco is what made me give these guys only 4 stars, but don't let that keep you from trying them out. The gentleman taking the orders was a truly kind guy with the spirit of a salesman, and the cook was very friendly too! If you need the items to go, just ask and they will wrap the little paper basket in foil for you",

I was happy to find a Mexican restaurant located near where I was staying in Pittsburgh with such a high rating on Yelp however when I went to La Palapa for dinner on a Thursday night looking to score frozen margaritas and tasty enchiladas, I was surprised at how bland and flavorless the food was.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Platter for 2 for dinner and were disappointed in the lack of flavor and seasoning. The Platter for 2 features 1 Tamal, 1 small Quesadilla, 1 Taquito, 1 Empanada, 2 ribs, 1 Chicken breast with a bowl of white rice and a few slices of avocado. We ordered this platter as a great way to sample just about everything on the menu but we didn't really enjoy anything.   My boyfriend loves, I mean LOVES Mexican food and all of its glorious spices so he was really disappointed that La Palapa fell flat in all areas of Mexican cuisine. We were also informed that in Pittsburgh it is difficult for smaller establishments to obtain a liquor license.. but what is a Mexican restaurant without Margaritas and Pina Coladas!",

    "text": "My family had a small birthday gathering for my sister's birthday here, and it was amazing.  Everyone was wonderful, from our server(s), to the manager. The mariachi band was an unexpected pleasure, and kindly came up and serenaded us in both Spanish and English, singing Las Mananitas, and variations of Happy Birthday, accompanied by violins, guitar(s), and trumpet. (Yes, we all tipped them too!) It was wonderful! The food was possibly the best food I've had anywhere, ever. I was immensely impressed. I had the fajitas special, and wow, 10/10. The corn tortillas were perfect, absolutely perfect. It's amazing how easy those are to mess up at other restaurants. The rice, so good I nearly dropped my fork. Most places, the rice is the weakest dish, passable, however at La Palapa, it's shockingly good. The mixed meats were again, perfect; shrimp, steak, and chicken, all cooked to perfection. The peppers and onions were tender, and neither under nor over done. Pinto beans, well, they're pinto beans, hard to mess up, but still delicious all by themselves. (Or slathered on top of my fajita fillings, but I'm probably weird that way. lol)  When I asked for a certain desert, our amazing server brought a beautiful substitute slice of tequila cake because they were out of what I'd requested. When I explained that sadly, I couldn't eat it because of the wheat, she very graciously allowed us to box up the cake for my sister, and gave me an insanely delicious flan de coco, without charging for the cake.  The decorations are exquisite, and for sale! It was all beautiful to look at, and very tempting to buy much of it!  The whole experience was something unexpected, and almost magical. I loved every second, and more importantly, I think my sister had a wonderful time on her birthday.  La Palapa instantly made my, \"favorite places to eat,\" list tonight. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu soon!   (On a side note, I strongly dislike most cilantro. I'm one of those odd people for whom cilantro usually tastes like soap, or stink bugs. When I saw that my dinner was covered in it, I got a little worried. However, I tried it, and to my surprise, the cilantro they use at La Palapa actually tasted GOOD to me. That rarely happens. :D )",

Mom had the chicken mole and oh goodness it was done perfectly! Side of rice and beans all cooked perfectly and lightly spiced. Flan for desert was beautiful and perfectly vanilla flavored.  Service was attentive and sweet and engaged. The space itself is beautiful- walls are decorated with Mexican folk art and the outside space is beautiful!  Can not recommend highly enough and I will definitely be back.",

We were seated 10 mins before happy hour ended in their heated outdoor patio, and the waitress hurriedly put our drink order in for the cheaper price!

We tried the quesadias today - one of each - chicken, beef and pulled pork.   3 for $10.00.  I liked the pulled pork.  It was fun. Plenty of benches facing the point.. to sit and eat at. The taco size was very similar to the quesadias.  Salsa, cilantro and sour cream is available -self serve at the front of the truck.  Forks and napkins were provided - nice (some food trucks do not provide).   I have found most food truck/buggie prices are above average. You really pay for the convenience and experience of it all.

Good news this place is authentic, I will say it wasn't as amazing as I have had though and there is no Al Pastor. The tamal was pretty good and definitely a good size but the tacos really weren't anything to write home about. The chorizo seemed to be devoid of any flavor save some burnt taste. I'd even go to the point of saying it's the worst chorizo I've had and the rice I ordered on the side wasn't even cooked through.   The service wasn't too bad. There was one girl running the joint while another guy was standing behind the counter watching TV. He was happy to get feedback and see that people were happy but did nothing else as the girl who was somewhat timid was busting around trying to get things done.   Bad chorizo, no pastor, I'm probably out on this place.",

Their food portions are HUGE and is packed with flavor and is priced well.  Love them and will keep going back.  Update: After going to them at least 2+ per month for the past 6months, they have moved to a new location, close to Birmingham bridge exist on E.Carson St.  I was excited to go support their new location. Service was a bit slow, wrong orders, very slow drink delivery. This location is no longer BYOB but does have a new extensive alcohol menu It seems to be on an upwards trend to make it a more \"upscale restaurant.\" I'm really happy that they're doing well, but I really hope that they keep up the mom/pops friendly and down to earth atmosphere as well. IT is what kept me coming back over and over. I know they're planning on adding more fancy things on the menu, but I do hope that they keep everything else the way it is.  I will certainly keep coming back and hope that the kinks will have worked out in the near future!",

    "text": "Family was in town for a long July 4th weekend, and the six of us decided to check out La Palapa for the first time. From friends' rave reviews to the impressive Yelp rating, I had high expectations as I walked through the door! I was a bit unsure at first though -- the restaurant is definitely a dive, and the waitress seemed a bit stand-offish. However, my opinion quickly changed once the food and drinks arrived!  We started with nachos paired with guac and cheese dip and with margaritas. Make sure to buy your own bottle of tequila in advance to mix with their heavenly margarita mix - BYOT! Somehow, their flavorful margarita mix is both sweet and savory with a tasty splash of orange. Both dips were absolutely delicious. The guacamole was well-seasoned, while the cheese dip was rich and bowl-licking good.  My husband and I decided to share the Charola para Dos, which was a great idea, especially for your first time dining at this restaurant. The plate looked overwhelmingly large when it was delivered, but even after our dips and drinks, the two of us easily polished off most of the large plate. The plate included an empanada, tamal, quesadilla, flauta, pork rib, and chicken with mole. Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS! My personal favorite on the plate was the perfectly cooked pork rib - seriously, you've never had a pork rib this good - followed by the empanada.   I cannot wait to return to La Palapa, and I'm already dreaming of having their margarita mix and tasty food again very soon.",

If you get nothing else, get this (it isn't vegetarian...the bacon says so).   For my main course, I ordered all of them, or just about. Trying to eat the Charola Para Dos! is tough. It's the sampler platter from the entree section. Everything was great. Get it, but unlike me, you can share it with friends. The platter includes a tamal, quesadilla, flauta, one pork rib, chicken with mole, and one very extremely and most delicious empanada. I literally ate half of each one and I've taken the rest home for me to eat over the next day or two.   As a southsider, I will be back to this restaurant again and again and again and again and again...",

Nope.   This is one of those places you feel bad about. We went on a Sunday night around 7PM and it was empty. The staff bought pizza from another shop for dinner.  Apparently they must've been bored eating the same thing every night.   Food was good. We got chips and salsa and guacamole. Salsa was warm and the chips were salty. The guac was fresh.   My lady got their barbacoa which was rather tasty. The beans and rice were a nice side.   I got the half chicken and rice and potatoes. I would've given this place 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that my chicken was cold and they needed to bring it back to the kitchen to reheat it which dried the meat out. Looks like they cook everything in the morning and then just reheat it which kind of ruins the authenticity.   It is BYOB with a $3 corking charge. Which is cool. And they have soda with real sugar in it which is a nice touch.   Overall would I come back? Probably not. Mad mex has that market on lock and Chipotle is the way to go for fast food. But it is a nice little local joint.",

The verde could not overcome the blandness.  They were also not very hot (temperature).  When our food came out within 5 minutes, I guess it was obvious that the food had already been cooked and was reheated.  The quesadillas were dripping everywhere  (yes, yes, I know...\"authentic\") and left a lake of liquid all over the plate, not very pleasant to eat especially when they were just warm, but my niece said the flavor was good.  The server was really nice and the place is clean and cute, but our overall experience was just okay.",

    "text": "I visited La Palapa with a friend on a Friday early evening.  It wasn't very crowded when we came in but it filled up around 7 pm.  It's a small joint - the former site of Thai Me Up - but when filled it wasn't loud.  The lighting is warm and the restaurant seems inviting.  The staff is incredibly nice.  They were really accommodating with seating requests and such.    The restaurant is BYOB and they offered to chill the white wine we brought while we waited.    I thought the food was rather good, especially for Mexican in Pittsburgh.  I think this is the closest thing we have to \"real\" Mexican food within Pittsburgh city limits, especially due to the demise of Mexico City (health code violations = death).  The chips were good - they reminded me of the style they serve at Las Velas, but seemed fresher and tasted better than those at Las Velas.  The guacamole tasted very good, although I didn't really think about it much at the time.  I ordered enchiladas which were marketed as being able to be served with chicken or beef, but the waiter told me I could have any meat listed at the bottom of the menu (this included chorizo, I believe seafood options, et al.). I chose pulled pork.  I thought the pulled pork enchiladas were very well done.  The pulled pork itself was moist and marinated well.  The corn tortillas (you can choose corn or flour for all dishes - this is great for me, who tries to avoid gluten) seemed really fresh.  I've been a lot of places where the corn tortillas fall apart easily, or where they are stale.  I was really happy with my meal as a whole.  Another plus is that they will run your credit card at your table with the ipad, and you can choose your tip portion by percentage.  I thought that was nice.  Overall - I thought this was a great dining experience.",

Beans and rice were phenomenal in comparison to the other Mexican places in the Burgh. The chiles rellenos con queso y espinaca, chicken nachos, chorizo enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and barbacoa flautas were all 10/10 delicious.   Pro tip- ask for the spicy homemade hot sauce. Not to spicy, perfectly flavored with peppers.  The coconut flan and the fried banana dessert were worth coming back for alone. It was totally affordable for the four of us (with 4 dinners, apps, and desserts: under 70 bucks).  Service is great- it's an authentic Mexican restaurant and the staff clearly cares about their food and your experience eating it. Loved it.",

    "text": "This place is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  We stopped here today for lunch and everything was absolutely amazing!!!  For an appetizer we had Nachos with Beef and Cheese.  These are now my #1 nachos in Pittsburgh.  Homemade chips, guacamole made *correctly*, cheese and meat and veggies on every chip.  The presentation is great and the portion size could be a meal in itself.  5/5 stars  The fiancee had the Chicken and Mushroom Enchiladas with vegetables instead of pinto beans.  She said it was delicious and almost finished all of it.  I tried a vegetable and even I would have eaten them.  I'm typically a strict carnivore...  5/5 stars  My Burrito Steelers was great.  I cannot mention other restaurants on here but my old favorite was *Fad Mex* if I wanted a burrito.  La Palapa has replaced them!  Every bite was a little bit different and fresh spices emanated from it.  I could only finish half of it because of the monster plate of nachos.  It was amazing...  5/5 stars  For the aforementioned food and two Mexican Coca Colas the total bill was $39.  And if you don't know what I mean by Mexican Coca Cola, TRY IT.  It's made with real cane sugar and no high-fructose corn syrup like Americanized craptastic coke up here.  They're $3 but worth every penny and you can tell a difference immediately.  I highly recommend this place if you like Mexican food.  Next trip...I'm trying the empanadas as well.  Compliments to the chef!",

    "text": "Friday was my first experience dining in with La Palapa. They recently moved closer to my house and i was excited to finally try it out. Ive walked by their previous location but it was tiny and for whatever reason i never stopped by. I had their items at yelp events though.  This location is adorable. It has cute art on the wall, high ceilings and tall windows which showcase the Birmingham Bridge. It might not seem like an extravagant view, but it's a lot more interesting than just seeing people walk down the street ya know?  We were stumped on what to order. Everything seemed good! Initially i almost got the enchiladas Verde but my husband went to order it instead... Which meant we needed more time. Finally we decided on getting their sampler platter called Charola para Dos. Its $28.95 and a Includes a tamal, quesadilla, flauta, pork rib, chicken with mole and a empanada. You can choose your meat or vegetarian option on all items.   Items in Charola papa Dos: Quesadilla (not really a quesadilla.. Like a folded fried tortilla shell with meat). We chose steak. It was good-- steak was flavorful.   For the empanada we chose beef and my goodness it was fabulous! Can't wait to order that as an appetizer itself next time.  For the flauta we chose chicken. I loved it! Super delicious!  Chicken with mole sauce was also great. Chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce went well with the rice served with the platter.  Pork rib was seasoned with Mexican spices and  sauce. Never had that on pork but wow it was great!   My least favorite item was the tamal. I personally felt like they could have chose some thing better... Like a taco or something. Maybe others find it tasty but it wasn't my thing to be honest.  We had the platter as our only dish but it filled us up. It could easily be an app for 3 people if everyone else was getting other food.  For dessert we went with the Sopapilla... fried tortillas with ice cream.. Loved it!  Service was great and even management stopped over to see how things were. He thanked us for our business and had small talk with us.. Super kind and humble guy.   Now, the downside. Ok in my personal opinion I find the drinks smaller, weak and overpriced. There was a special on margaritas for 7.95 i believe. (Normally $9 or $10) we each ordered 2. In comparison to other nearby places They were served in pretty small glasses and weren't strong in my opinion. At normally $10 i couldn't chill at the bar & have multiple margs with the girls. I do want to note that the margaritas were delicious, just weak.   Despite that i loved our experience here... Good food, service, management, cute inside, patio seating beginning soon and a cool bar. Im thankful we live so close. I'll be back for empanadas and to try the chicken mole and pork ribs as entrees",

We stared with the beef empanada which was tasty. Came with half the verde sauce and half the mole sauce on top, and while tasty, I wish would have been on the side because it took away from the soft crunch I was looking for in the empanada pastry.   I ordered four tacos- bistec, rajas, barbacoa, and chorizo. To my surprise, the rajas packed the most flavor but all were very well done. The tacos were double layered (I guess this is authentic Mexican style? I approve!) with corn tortillas, a scoop of rice, cilantro, and salsa.    My girlfriend got the enchiladas in the verde sauce. This came with rice and a zucchini/ squash medley. The enchiladas seemed a bit on the small side. She got one chicken, one beef and one cheese. The most disappointing thing was that the chicken and beef ones didn't have any cheese on them at all! This made for a rather dry and flavor-lacking experience. Honestly, the cheese one was the best one.   We also had the house marg for $5 which was very good as well. Complimented the dishes nicely. I could see some people claiming it was on the weaker side, but I'm not a big tequila guy so it was fine to me!  Apparently they have a Taco Tuesday deal (three tacos for $7) which I'd totally come back for. Our waitress was great and the food does seem authentic, albeit could use work in some areas. Id be interested in tasting some of their other dishes too!",

The friendly waiter uncorked, poured, and even switched out our glasses in between bottles. There was a $3 corkage fee.  We started with guacamole and chips. The guacamole was delicious and chunky, but the chips were a bit stale (which was surprising because of the amount of them I imagine that this place goes through in a night).   For my entree I had the Enchiladas with mole sauce. One each of ground beef, chicken, and cheese, they were generously topped with the mole of my dreams and served with rice and pinto beans. I loved the enchilada tortillas and the mole tasted as though it was simmered for hours by an abuela in the kitchen. It was absolutely amazing. The chicken and beef enchiladas were both terrific.... and the cheese one, while filled generously,  could have been hotter. The cheese was barely melted.  For dessert I has wonderful house-made flan. It was the best I had ever had in a restaurant.... creamy, dreamy, and wonderful.... with the deep taste of melted sugar filling each bite. \"La Palapa\" is a solid choice for authentic Mexican food..... an I highly recommend anything topped with that amazing mole!",

However, it is easy to get a seat, and the servers are very polite. The menu is quite extensive, and you can have a lot of choices for types of meat.  I ordered the ground beef taco and a Mexican hot chocolate. The taco was rich and flavorful, with many toppings on it. It's definitely one of the most enjoyable tacos I've ever had. I especially enjoyed the taco shell - though it was soft, it was really crispy and warm. I really enjoyed the Mexican hot chocolate. It was sweet, but had a unique flavor that I hadn't tasted before in hot chocolate.",

I ordered the sopa de tortilla and the enchiladas verdes with chicken. The soup was full of flavor and had a nice kick. The enchiladas were also delicious, and the accompanying rice and beans were solid. The enchiladas were topped with plenty of sauce and cheese and the portion was very generous. All of the food tasted freshly made with quality ingredients.  I'll definitely be going back to La Palapa whenever I'm in the mood for Mexican food.",

We were surprised to find only four pages of options, but they were all the best traditional Mexican dishes.         The food was all perfectly seasoned and portions were great. Our queso dip starter was delicious and we watched one of the staff members make guacamole table side for a number of guests. If you enjoy traditional Mexican food you will love it here.",

I was not understanding why that would be a problem.

When we first sat down, our very friendly waiter brought their complimentary basket of what I think were some type of puffed chip and hot sauce and we placed an order for queso and chips. We both really didn't care for the chips and asked for them to be taken away. We also found the queso to be very bland and then ordered salsa so that we could add it to the queso, which then tasted much better. For our entrees, he ordered enchiladas verdas rojos and I ordered pollo asado with fries. He thought his food was full of flavor. I tried it and I agreed that it was good. My meal was absolutely covered in onions and peppers to a crazy level. I honestly really didn't eat very much of the chicken and ate most of the fries. I thought the chicken was dry.  We took my leftovers to go, but we ended up not even eating them because it wasn't great. I don't think will be back when I'm in Pittsburgh again. The food really wasn't anything that stood out. I did think our waiter was incredibly nice and dedicated, and our service was very quick.",

    "text": "I write this review very reluctantly!   My family and a friend went to La Palapa about 10 days ago. My son (8 yrs old) proceeded to order from the kids menu - chicken quesadilla but with the chicken on the side. He liked the quesadilla enough and was hungry enough to order the same dish twice.   Anyway he did not touch his chicken and only ate the cheese quesadilla and other things on the plate. We took the chicken to go since he expressed an interest in eating it the next day.   So the next day, we take the chicken out of the fridge and I dump it directly into a fresh out of the dishwasher plate to heat up for my son's lunch and what I see in the chicken at first glance looks like a long hair. On closer inspection, it is a large bug that had gotten very comfortable in the chicken!   Obviously the food went into the garbage.   I then wrote to La Palapa through their website and provided my email and phone number so they could connect with me and I could tell them in person how we found the bug in my son's food. I figured waiting a week or slightly more would be appropriate for La Palapa to reach out and tell us what they thought might have happened.   While stuff happens, It is nice to know that the restaurant cares about the food they serve. This was definitely not the case in our experience given that LaPalapa has not responded to my 3 attempts to contact them for 10 days!",

It has pretty basic decor and is actually quite small. The service is excellent and the food comes out in a timely fashion. It's also BYOB- I highly recommend their margarita mix.",

There's seating for about 30 in this small Mexican restaurant. It never seems to be very busy, but the food is great! My girlfriend and I started with chips and salsa. We got both the verde and pico salsas and both were very good. I like that they warm up the verde salsa. For entrees, I ordered the Lengua en Salsa Verde (beef tongue) with rice and beans and Toni ordered the chicken Enchiladas Verdes. My beef tongue was incredibly tender and flavorful. The meat just fell apart. I used my corn tortillas to create tacos with the beef, rice, and their very spicy hot sauce. Toni's enchiladas were tasty, but the chicken was a little dry.  All in all, this place has consistently good and AUTHENTIC Mexican food. $33 for 2 entrees + chips and salsa is slightly higher than some Mexican joints, but the quality and portion sizes make it easily justifiable. I'll be back.",

Lots of flavor, great textures, and plenty of fresh ingredients. Plus a generous portion! Then everyone in our party ordered the same dish- the Chiles en Nogada. Y-U-MMMMMM! This poblano pepper, stuffed with ground beef and fruits, with a creamy sauce topped with pomegranate seeds is a really special dish for this time of year. La Palapa totally nailed it!   Besides the delicious food, their new location is gorgeous. The artwork adorning the walls, the lighting and the whole layout is a great improvement over their former location - which was already quite nice, if a bit too small. The patio in the back of the restaurant is a great space for a gathering, I couldn't help but think. The staff was professional, courteous and efficient.  Overall, we simply love La Palapa, more and more each time we go.",

    "text": "I have been to La Palapa twice, an intimate and unassuming little place that serves the most exquisite Mexican food that will ever grace your day. From the home made chips and salsa through the taco and burrito plates, I doubt you will find such tasty and authentic food anywhere in Pixburgh. An additional treat is the fresh fruit beverage concocted everyday, at least in the summer. If you are served by Alberto, you are in good hands. I would think that the great dining here would could only be matched by being a guest at a dinner at a friend's home in Juarez or Tijuana. It's that authentic and that good. In fact, stop reading now and head on to the SousSide for the fish tacos or the potato flautas. Thank  me later.",

    "text": "OK.  Now were talkin'.  The food here is yummie-delicious.  I had 2 quesadillas-one w/chicken and one w/mushrooms.  What a delightful surprise-especially the mushroom.  Everyone loves my special mushroom dishes and this one at La Palapa is just a different taste profile and better than mine.  A friend of mine had the mole-she is an excellent cook and loved the mole.  Another friend had chorizo quesadillas and also had great appreciation for his dish.  We also had the watermellon juice which I believe was special for the day.  I've only had this concoction in Soho in NYC (much more $) and this libation equally good and in prettier glass.  And the price-forget about it-downright cheap.  Can't wait to return and have the dessert.  I love flan and I'll bet theirs' is excellent.  I was there on Th. afternoon and 2 other tables were taken-so you should be able to find accomodations.  I couldn't be happier to have this place in my neighborhood-never leave!!",

The tamel was so tasty and the house made chips were practically impossible to stop munching on.  Next I had the flautas de barbacoa and it was almost as good as eating dessert.  The meat was tender and flavorful and the flautas was crispy and crunchy.  Simply delectable.  My suggestion: ask for a side of creme fraiche for dipping.  My BF had the local braised beef tongue which was also delicious from the few tastes that I had.  He was also very pleased. Sad that I wasn't able to order a margarita or a beer, but I will remember to bring my own booze next...and there will definitely be a next time.",

    "text": "So I stopped in here for lunch on a whim and so glad I did. I will definitely be back. I'm somewhat of a Mexican food snob in the way that the only thing I don't like about Mexican food is when someone tries to Americanize it. That is definitely not the case here. Authentic, legit, simple, no fuss Mexican grub. I had barbacoa taco and a chicken quesadilla with the best sour cream and gauc I've had in a long time. But the shining star? The cream of poblano and corn soup! According to my delightful server, I didn't get his name but he was awesome attentive and informative, it's award winning and completely vegetarian....and absolutely de-lish. The broth was thin and light with fresh cilantro but not too much to become overpowering and the spice from the poblanos was perfect. Muchas Gracias La Palapa para almuerzo. (I only had 3 years of Spanish so if that doesn't translate right, blame Senora Flasco)",

It is a bit of a dive, and it feels like you are eating in someone's home, which I tend to like myself.  The food was far more tasty and authentic than most of the better Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, and is reasonably priced.  I got 2 different types of samplers - more than enough to feed 2 people, and everything on there was great.  If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for their house made hot sauce - very nice flavor.  Service was great - we had a young gentleman who was the owner's son - he was very polite, friendly and professional.  We will definitely be back.  It is also BYOB, and they have horchata.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this place today after decided to eat elsewhere - our other restaurant choice had a 45 minute wait time. We started with the special soup of the day - poblano corn soup. It was amazing! Highly recommends. Such a heart soup that tasted homemade. Could not have been better. For mains, my boyfriend had the Pollo Asado with rice and beans. The chicken was cooked excellently - nice and moist, and he enjoyed his meal, but the taste of the sauce was not to my liking. It is mild and has a chocolate base - if you want it spicy, you need to add hot sauce on the side. I had the bbq pork quesadilla and the Barbacoa steak quesadilla with flour tortillas - both were excellent, although I did like the bbq pork one better - it was tastier because of the sauce. Both quesadillas were served with a small side of guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. We wanted to try their hot chocolate, but were too full! The table next to us couldn't stop raving about it.   It's a small, but extremely cosy place. I loved the ambience. Good music, good service. A definite must try. You won't be disappointed!",

Unlike most Mexican restaurants, the place itself was like the size of a person's living room, giving the restauranteur a homier feeling. A word of advice: make reservations since they have limited seating. The NoWait app is a great way to make your reservations. My favorite dish to get at Mexican restaurants are flautas and the ones from La Palapa do not disappoint. Their portion size is huge and I ended up having a lot left over. Whenever I crave for Mexican food, I always think of La Palapa and can't wait until I go back!",

Service was great but we did get there at 12 and it wasn't busy. By the time we left it was crowded and there was only 1 server for he entire place.   They use square for credit cards and ring you up right at your table. Finally someone that gets this. Great way to pay.   Def will go back and try some new items.   The place was very clean and certainly a unknown gem!   They also do catering and could be great for steeler games or parties.",

I am rarely impressed by moles at restaurants but I took a chance and was thrilled by how good it was. The chicken was flavorful and tender and the mole flavor was complex and truly mouth-watering. The second time I went, I got the Lengua en Salsa Verde. The meat (locally sourced) was tender and flavorful and the salsa verde had lots of flavor with the perfect amount of heat.  Sides: For both entrees, the accompanying rice and beans were delicious.  I also got the soup special: nopal (cactus) and corn soup...savory with the nopal providing a uniquely flavored crunch. Dessert:  Finally, I had coconut flan with raspberry drizzled on it...I am not much of a sweets person, but the flan was perfect and beautifully presented.",

We got down to business and shared some guac and chips. For our main meal, we shared the flautas (2 barbacoa/2 chicken), which comes with rice, pinto beans or veggies. We substituted the rice for the veggies. Let me tell you... those were some of the most delicious veggies I've ever had. So well prepared and seasoned!  To supplement the flautas we ordered one pulled pork taco.  We couldn't finish all of it, so keep that in mind when you're making your choices. I was stuffed but got some churros to go because... duh. I had one before we went back into the cold and I was so glad that I did.",

Then we both ordered from the churrasco section and were blow away. I got tbone with rice and sweet potato fries. The tbone was seasoned pretty darn good and cooked to order and I never knew sweet potato fries could be so amazing from a Mexican place. The chicken seasoning made my boyfriend surrender to deliciousness, he put his fork down and said \"im done. This is too good\". Ended it all with a nice coffee. Not one complaint! Except they didn't give us Ice with the water which i thought was weird, but I'm sure they would have gave me some if I asked. Also BYOB nice touch always.

Chips and guacamole - guacamole was very fresh.  Then I had three tacos - chorizo, fish, and pulled pork.  All of them were large with substantial amounts of very flavorful meat.  The total was $25 with tip so it isn't extremely cheap, but if you just want a meal the tacos itself were about $11.  Our waitress was very sweet and helpful.  Of the mexican places I've been to recently in Pittsburgh (place below Reyna's, Mad Mex, Cantina)  I would say this is the best.  The only bad part is no alcohol but it is BYOB.",

    "text": "So I saw the 4 1/2 star rating a bookmarked this place in excitement for our trip to Pittsburgh. Now that I literally just finished eating, I felt compelled to write my review immediately. Boooo! Not nearly as good as I was hoping. I mean, the chicken tacos weren't bad per se, just not worthy of that 4 1/2 star rating guys. I ordered the chicken tacos and the meat was ok, the tortillas were heated up in a pan or on the stovetop maybe (?) but either way, they were hard and sort of ruined my 'soft' taco. Also, they forgot the rice on the side or on the actual taco (not sure how they usually do it). One plus, the chicken was juicy and not dry. Also a plus, the service was good. The server was very pleasant. But overall, I was a kind of disappointed. The food just average at best.",

We've always been satisfied with our meals, but there just feels like something is missing--some of the flavors blend together, especially the more often you go. But their food is dependable, and their guacamole is prime--made right by the table to your specifications (spicy level, saltiness, etc.).  The food specials are something to look out for, as they often have special meats or better deals that will definitely make your trip worth it.  We will inevitably return to La Palapa in the future, especially for their Taco Tuesday deals or drink specials. We also appreciate that they clearly label the gluten free options to make it easier for those of us with dietary restrictions.  Overall, reliable Mexican food option, but not a \"blow your socks off\" choice that would make it the best option in the city.",

    "text": "I have a joke that I share with a good friend: We are perpetually searching for the perfect empanada.  She lived in Puerto Rico for a little while, and misses authentic foods she had there; None more than the empanadas.  So when she told me she had found her favorite empanadas in the city at La Palapas, I knew I had to try them for myself.  We went yesterday. The restaurant itself is decorated exquisitely with genuine Mexican folk art. Everything for bold masks and mirrors to colorful Horse and Sabre-Tooth Tiger figures. We decided to try several small plates so that we could sample as much as possible. We chose to split the Jalepeno dip, and we each ordered a quesadilla and (of course) an empanada.  The Jalepeno Cheese Dip was a bit of a let down. It was runny, and thus very messy and hard to pick up with the chips. I'm pleased to say, it all went uphill from here. They brought out the empanadas next. These were absolutely the crowd-pleasers my friend touted them as. I got shrimp and my boyfriend got chicken. Each came with it's own sauce and they were the perfect pillowy concoction of meat and dough... The textureand flavor were so unreally on point. Absolutely the best empanadas I've ever had. The quesadillas came out last. He got the Mushroom quesadilla and I got the Chorizo quesadilla. Be warned, they aren't the bigger-than-your-head quesadillas that you get a lot of places around Pittsburgh, but at the low low price of $3.50, I wasn't expecting an arm-length 'dilla. The chorizo was perfectly juicy and zesty. The mushrooms in Chris's quesadilla were a surprise: Savory and sweet, and I believe I detected some cinnamon. Both were small but mighty, bursting with flavor, and the accompanying salsa and guacamole were just wonderful. I've had La Palapas at events and from the food truck, but nothing compares to getting the food from the restaurant (a full kitchen enables any cook to prepare their dishes at the optimal standard) I'll be coming back to try the Costilla de Puerco and one or two of the great sounding house cocktails!",

    "text": "Decent Mexican place in Pittsburgh.  It's hard to come across Mexican food in Pittsburgh, and La Palapa does a great job of providing a moderate variety of everyone's favorite Mexican dishes.  To start off, their table side guac is awesome, is very fresh, and is just a nice show to have. They do the classic live avocado cutting and grinding, and mixing in all the ingredients. It's fun to watch and an absolute joy to eat.  For my main, I wasn't a big fan of the fajitas---there wasn't a whole lot of meat, and the tortillas were pretty bland. The seasoning was alright, I guess, but just because there was so much non meat items on the plate, it didn't really feel worth it.  I also ordered some tacos on the side, and they are definitely on the small side, but have a whole lot going on in a small bite, which is nice.  All in all, not a bad place to get Mexican food. I really loved the service by Jamie, and am excited to come back sometime!",

They moved and are now next to Mallorca now. They painted and put lots of great Mexican artifacts and decor all over the walls and have Mexican stars hanging from the ceiling. It's magical.   We started with the chorizo appetizer and it was soooooo good.  I had the chicken, sausage and cheese enchiladas rancheras, which were good with rice (kind of dry) and pinto beans. Next time, I'd go back to my barbacoa, which is absolutely delicious. My husband had the pollo asado that he loved with the most delicious potatoes and veggies. We finished the night with the tequila cake, which was ok, but had WAY too much tequila. I love tres leches cake, but you couldn't taste the cake because all you could taste was tequila. I like tequila, but it was overkill.   The waitress was super sweet and extremely attentive. We didn't have to beg her for anything. The host was very welcoming too.",

There was a miscommunication between the host and the waiter and we had to wait about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table.  Once we got service, the waiter brought a crunchy appetizer and hot sauce that was pretty good.  We had the table side guacamole, which was fun to watch and delicious!  I tried a few different tacos and the steak were the best by far.  The taco Tuesday special is 3 tacos for $7, so it's a pretty good deal.  We each had a margarita too, and would have had another but either our server or the bar was backed up and we were finished eating by the time the margaritas were ready.  Overall I would recommend La Palapa for the food and hope that the service gets better with time.",

    "text": "Holy portions! If you want some serious bang for your buck, stop at La Palapa on E. Carson St. on the South Side.  Just to be clear, this review is on a to-go order that my loving husband picked up on his way home from work..  So, back to why we are here, the food.. we ordered the chips and salsa, the black and gold burrito, and one of each kind of taco: shredded chicken, pork, chorizo, and steak. In my (self-proclaimed) professional taco opinion, I rank them: 1. Steak 2. Pork 3. Chorizo and 4. Chicken. Each taco came with a doubled up corn shell, sprinkled with a bit of rice, topped with cheese, cream, and the pico. Each taco was PACKED with the protein. The steak was grilled and tasty, the pork was shredded and juicy, the chorizo was a bit greasy but very tasty, and the chicken was tasty but a little on the dry side.  As far as that monstrous burrito?? We (2 grown adults with hearty appetites) were so full after the chips & tacos that all we could do was cut it open, try a little sliver, and pack the rest up for lunch (for both of us) tomorrow.  So why 4 stars? The onions from the tacos/pico definitely linger & that's not my favorite thing in life. The chorizo was greasy.. like saturated the bottom of all the rest of the taco shells greasy. So maybe if you order the chorizo taco to-go, ask to have it wrapped separately. And finally, the chicken was dry.   Overall.. I'll be back. I was satisfied with that the flavors and the portions and now I want to try those margaritas!  Update: Make your way to their new spot on East Carson. The decor is interesting and the owner was very proud of the art and the patio. The food was delicious and we will definitely return!",

It also took about 4 asks to get a round of waters for the table.  The table side quacamole is awesome, but the queso had a grainy texture, and the \"best selling\" salsa was basically chopped vegetables.   They have a good taco Tuesday special: 3 tacos (of your choosing) for $7, but they were topped with parmesan cheese?   I think this was probably just an off day, but I won't be back. Tacos are subpar, margaritas are small and expensive, and the service just wasn't there.",

The service was decent enough and the new location in the old Ibiza space is pretty spacious, but the food really dragged the place down.    We started with the jalapenos rellenos.  The were served more like poppers - a half jalapeno open-faced, filled with cheese and topped with bacon bits.  Somehow with those ingredients, they were bland and not in any way spicy.   And not really what I would have pictured for a dish named rellenos.    On to the guacamole.  We don't like the fuss of tableside, so we just ordered the 8 oz side and some chips.  The chips were a bit stale.  The guac had a ton of uneven chunks of white onion in it.  Big, small, and in between.   So many that I couldn't even work around it.  I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a guacamole.    Next was the tacos.  I got three.  They all had ample meat filling, but little else.  If there was sour cream, I couldn't find it on any of them.  The barbacoa was good, albeit a little boring.   The chorizo and potatoes was inedible- sopping wet with grease soaked through a double tortilla.  The steak and onions was very chewy and came with more raw, not cooked, onion.   All three were then topped with pico de gallo, which again was primarily raw white onion.     Overall, I enjoyed none of it.  And that's a shame because I really love authentic Mexican.",

We will definitely be back to try more!!! It was margarita day so of course I had to have one--did the original flavor. Was super yummy and they clearly use the good tequila  check it out if you're in the mood for some fantastic Mexican cuisine!",

And their new jalapeno cheese dip is mmm! The best Mexican in town!",

    "text": "A few coworkers and I decided to visit La Palapa for lunch, none of us had been yet, and I couldn't remember the name for the life of me (kept referring to it as \"that place where Thai Me Up used to be\"). After walking for 15 minutes or so on a hot August afternoon to get here, we were pleased to find that they had A/C, albeit a window unit above the door, but it kept the space cool enough that we were comfortable.  The first thing we noticed is the change in decor. Everything is brighter, the space feels a lot more open and welcoming. Our waiter was with us immediately, gave us menus, and quickly went down the list of drinks. One of the options was a pitcher of margarita mix, which means that as several other reviews have previously mentioned, they're BYOB and welcoming of your booze. Unfortunately, no margarita pitcher for us since we all had to head back to work before long.  A couple orders for appetizers were put in - the beef empanada, and chips with guac. My first thought was that the chips and guac were a bit on the pricey side. When they came out, though, it was a healthy serving of chips clearly made on-site and a decent amount of guac, both of which tasted great and were worth the expense. The empanada was also good.  For a meal, I went with a beef quesadilla and chicken quesadilla, which were both delicious though I was partial to the beef. Also, the right amount of food - enough to satisfy, but not make me feel like I was rolling back to the office.  Overall, definitely a nice experience, and we'll be back before long.",

    "text": "A new favorite! I lived in rural southern Oregon for many years, and mourned the absence of real, home-cooked Mexican food in Pittsburgh when I came here 14 years ago. Things have improved somewhat since then, but I still hadn't found a place that filled that hole - until I came here.   My significant other and I brought my daughter here for dinner to celebrate her birthday, and relished every bite that was laid in front of us. We started with chips and guacamole - warm out-of-the-fryer chips, not too salty, and fresh guac. Heaven. I had the special - tilapia stuffed with spinach with tequila sauce, a fresh, light sauce with chopped tomatoes that was delectable. S.O. had the seafood stew, which he devoured and said contained the best mussels he'd ever eaten. My daughter chose the fajitas, which she also raved about.  The seating area is small, but we got right in even on a Saturday night, and the staff were super-friendly. We will definitely be back!",

The toppings were not too heavy or too light and the prices were low ($3.25 a taco). This tastes like genuine Mexican food, and this isn't something I experience often (if ever) in Pittsburgh.  Beyond great food you can expect excellent service, our server Lester was friendly and attentive. A really good server is proactive and when our Mexican cokes were low he brought us glasses of water without any input from us. The owner was also very friendly and checked up on us. We felt at home and stayed to talk with them about how they're enjoying Pittsburgh.   You can get take out (which I will be doing frequently) or eat in where there's seating for around 20 or so people  The place has a great atmosphere and is conveniently located at a good part of the South Side. I can't wait to stop by again!",

Overall opinion: fairly bland like other mexican food in this area (except El Rey, which is awesome ), but still good service and nice presentation. The staff was kind, prompt, and attentive.   I got beef nachos and he got fajitas....while they both looked great and seemed to have quality, fresh ingredients, mine was underwhelming and lacked flavor. It tasted like the meat was unseasoned, and the chips seemed like out of the bag stuff. His fajita steak was mediocre quality, but I will give them points for serving it with poblano peppers (all I use to make fajitas; love em) and grilled pineapple (nice accent). He said the poblanos kept him from calling it completely bland.   Another thing we found odd (and unpreferable)...instead of serving chips and salsa as a starter, they served us these orange pinwheels of flavorless crunchy Styrofoam with buffalo and jalapeno sauce. I like that it was different but...it was just not good.   If you like the type of mexican served in this area, you'll probably like it. I'm used to something a little more full bodied & flavorful.",

I really love their mole sauce and chicken tamales, would definitely recommend trying them.  They also give you chicharrones here as complementary snacks which I like.   Service here has been very friendly and fast. Also love the decor and how everything seems to have a purpose. Small thing, but I enjoy it. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for authentic mexican food.",

We were seated in the upstairs section because the patio was a bit chilly for several members of our party.  Our servers were great.  They are going for the Mexico City kind of feel and it works.  First, the chips and salsa were quite good.  Next up, the fish soup was delicious.  Large chunks of fish in a savory broth.  I then had the enchiladas.  The mole was rich and flavorful - very decadent.    If in Pittsburgh and desiring Mexican, this place is a must.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here with a couple of friends for his birthday. Happy hour was from 5-7, so we had time to get a couple $6 La Palapa margaritas before 7. I'm not a fan of sour mix, but their margaritas were good!  We ordered a couple of appetizers: jalapeno cheese dip and tableside guac. The guac was great! It's always cool when guac is made tableside. The jalapeno cheese dip was good too...a little runny, but still yummy, especially along with the guac.  For dinner, my husband ordered a few tacos and a barbacoa quesadilla. I, of course, had to have a bite of the quesadilla and it was so good! One of our friends ordered tacos too. Both of them said the tacos had a lot of meat and were flavorful. I ordered the mole chicken con poblanos with rice and veggies. The chicken was cooked well and the mole was yummy. The veggies consisted of broccoli, squash and spinach and was cooked really well. Our other friend ordered the tilapia tostadas appetizer. He loved it. The ceviche was perfect.  Finally, they brought out some sopapillas with vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup swirled on top. Again, so good even though we were all stuffed to the max!  Overall, we all had an awesome time. The place has a great atmosphere and they had live music playing up front. We sat in the back on the covered indoor patio and could still hear the music just fine. Our server, Hector, was super friendly and quick. Another thing to note is that they have their own parking lot, which was super convenient! We would go back again, for sure.",

Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by the food this time. My husband ordered a few tacos and I ordered the Mole con Pollo. Everything looked great on the plate, I will say. However, my chicken was a little bland. The mole sauce was okay, but I've had better. The worst of my meal was the soggy veggies, which seemed to be straight from one of those frozen veggie steamers that you throw in the microwave.   Another thing I noticed, and maybe this isn't necessarily True, but our waitress seemed to only recommend items that were more expensive. For both our appetizers and entrees, my husband and I would ask which was more popular or which she liked more, and she consistently suggested the more expensive item. Maybe I'm just crazy.   Unfortunately, Pittsburgh has a lot of Mexican food options that I don't think I'll ever be back to La Palapa.",

They were totally booked with reservations at their larger new location, but they said they would be able to accommodate us. Well worth the wait! We started with their tortilla soup which was my favorite part of the meal- the egg in the soup made it so different and delicious! We split the porterhouse steak with potatoes and veggies, and shared a chicken taco and beef taco. The steak was done to perfection- melt in your mouth and full of flavor. They get all their beef from Clarion Farms up North- the quality of their meat is outstanding! Love that they support local.  The service and everyone working there was so kind and accommodating. It looks like everyone is happy and loves being busy. This is so refreshing. Not one employee was cranky or rude at the heat of their busiest time when the place was packed. We really enjoyed our dinner here and can't wait to come back and try more! Flavortown!",

The taco had a good toasted shell and plenty of toppings. The meat was very flavorful but had a bit more juice than I usually like.   They also give a basket of fried flour (I forget the name) as a bar snack while you wait. AND, 10% cash back with Yelp if you are already signed up. With the daily specials, drink specials, and all the seating options - La Palapa should certainly be a stop on your Carson Street tour!",

You walk in from Carson street and immediately transported into Mexico   Service - prompt, attentive, and ensures your table has everything you need.   Food - DELICIOUS. I came for brunch and we had  Spinach Tomato Tamales, with tender rice, and flavorful pinto beans. The green sauce is tangy and full of layered roasted yumminess. My favorite is the bottle of \"spicy\" sauce the waiter brought us, it adds a really good kick!   I had the chicken chilaquiles with green sauce. It comes with lots of refried beans, chips, and fresh onions/cilantro. Also very good.   My FAVORITE though was a broth based tortilla soup. The chips were crunchy in the deep bodied hot soup. There were sweet tomatoes, onion, big chunks of garlic, and lots of cilantro. My favorite part was the poached egg. I've had a lot of tortilla soup (usually tomato based) so this was a new take that I haven't had before.   Overall an excellent experience and I recommend to anyone looking for something different.",

I decided that the place with better reviews would be it.  Except they both had good reviews, mostly from my fellow elites.  I ultimately decided on La Palapa because it was Tuesday and I needed tacos.  Yes, this was the right decision.  My server Shawna was friendly and helpful and just made the whole meal even better.  The Tuesday special is 3 tacos for $7.50 and you can mix it up (i.e. you don't have to get 3 of the same kind).  They have lots of taco options, too, including fish and vegetarian.  I went with one chicken, one barbacoa and one beef tongue.  I also ordered a Tecate for happy hour ($1 off).  My plate of tacos was a beautiful presentation that I almost didn't want to eat.  But don't worry, I did.  And I foolishly thought I might even take a taco home.  Nope, didn't happen.    And not that I needed it, but something sweet sounded really good.  Especially when Shawna mentioned a tequila cake they had available for dessert.  It totally hit that sweet spot and was the perfect ending to my meal.   Reasonable prices for amazing food in a bright and open space makes La Palapa one of the few places in the South Side that I will make a point of returning to.",

I really like Mexican food but living in California made me spoiled with what I expect from Mexican food. The restaurant itself is nice it has outside seating. I ordered flatas with barbacoa it comes with rice and beans and my boyfriend ordered the Steelers burrito (something like that). Out food came out in less then 5 minutes which always sets off alarms in my head. My food was topped with lettuce which I never understand why in Pennsylvania they think lettuce is supposed to be in tacos, burritos ect. (It's not). My flatas were really hard, they almost seemed over cooked or stale and the barbacoa was really dry. I was underwhelmed with the food and I was really looking forward to it since I love Mexican food. We also ordered drinks during happy hour and the menu price was different than what they charged us we got overcharged or charged the regular price even though the waiter kept telling us about the happy hour that was happening. Altogether I'd maybe go back to try something else since it wasn't a terrible experience just not my cup of tea.",

I highly recommend their nachos! Another favorite of mine are their empanadas especially the shrimp empanada. The beef empanada is good also but the shrimp one is my favorite.  Dont forget to get a pineapple or lime Jarritos with your meal.

We don't actually have any superbly good Mexican at all. I've never actually had authentic Mexican, which is why I came here. What a treat!  We started with tableside guacamole. Oh, this was divine. Yes, you are paying for the show, but the finished product is SO GOOD. So many fresh flavors, I could have eaten this as my meal.   I chose the beef enchiladas for my main course. I opted for mole sauce versus verde sauce because I've never had mole sauce. OH. MY. GOD. I can't begin to describe the depth of flavors in this sauce. Bitter chocolate and peppers. Those of you that have had mole know what I mean. Those who haven't, need to try it. Even the rice had great flavor. The pinto beans were much more satisfying and tasty than a five gallon can of refried beans slopped on a plate.   By the way, have you ever had real sour cream?  Not the emulsified junk you are familiar with...REAL sour cream?  They have it here. It's delicious. It's decidedly more sour and less thick than store bought, but oh...it was just perfect to top on that spicy mole covered enchiladas.   Hubby travels for work extensively (85% of the time).  He's been to El Paso and Tuscon, and he declared his beef fajitas \"the best damn Mexican I've ever had!\"  I think that is saying something, don't you?  Just go!",

I got a tamale and I enjoyed it! It's just that I am not craving to go back like I usually am.   Recommend for Mexican food.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this last Thursday evening with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to a completely packed restaurant with no tables available.  Thankfully our friends were already there and had grabbed the last table for all of us.  La Palapa isn't a terribly large place and I would guess that it can seat about 30 people or so in the dining room.  This means that it can get very loud in there especially whenever there are larger groups at some of the tables as there was on this Thursday. It is decorated with photos on the walls from what I imagine to be Mexico.  Our group decided to start off the night by splitting both the chips and queso as well as the chips and guacamole for our appetizers.  The chips seemed to be freshly made but were pretty oily and seemed to lack some seasoning.  They were crunchy though and tasted good in both of the dips, each of which was creamy and delicious in its own way.   For my entree I decided on the enchiladas nortenas which consisted of 3 chicken enchiladas in a red sauce, a 6 oz steak and then the rice and pinto beans that comes with each entree.  I also ended up ordering a barbacoa quesadilla as a side dish to my meal.  All of the parts of my entree were decent with my favorite parts being the steak and the quesadilla.  While the steak seemed to have only been cooked on one side (pink until half on one side, well done on the other), it was thin enough that it still tasted good and I liked that it seemed to have the texture of the skirt steak.  What I liked about the quesadilla was the perfectly crispy shell and the flavor of the meat.  At $3.50, this may have been the best value of the evening for me.  Last but not least, even though we were all stuffed from having eaten our meals, our table decided to finish our meal by splitting a sopapilla.  While it wasn't like the sopapillas that I have had in Arizona, it was still good and seemed like a mash-up of churros and strawberry ice cream done right.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  This place is BYOB, reasonable priced and has some good food, so why not?",

The beef tongue my friend got was much better. We shared a pork chop dish. The pork was okay, but the sauce was really flavorful.   I don't know whether it's too authentic or I ordered the wrong items. Not sure if I'd like to come back.",

The atmosphere was nice, everyone talking and enjoying themselves. We brought two fifths of tequila with us and they will supply the pitcher of mix for you. It costs $12 per pitcher, and I believe they charge $3 per person to byob. Still a good deal. The waiter was fast to welcome us and very friendly.  He brought out salt and limes as well as ice. We ordered the guac and chips, the queso, a chile rellano, and I asked if they had a bean dip which they did not. The guac was delish! The chips were def homemade and a little greasy, but still crispy and tasty. The queso was watery, the flavor was good, but the cheese just dripped off of the chip. I prob wouldn't order the queso again. They tried to accommodate us with a \"bean dip,\" but it was more like they poured some beans on a plate and served them. They weren't good. I appreciate them trying, but for $5, I'll pass next time. The chile rellano was FABULOUS.  I ordered the enchiladas with the mole sauce. The mole sauce was the best I've ever had. Flat out delicious. I ordered two mushroom and one cheese enchiladas. The mushroom enchilada was on point, very very good. My meal came with a side of veggies and rice. Both tasty. Our waiter did bring our chicken fajitas when the one girl ordered steak, and my other friend had her order a little messed up also. That is the only reason this place doesn't get a perfect 5 stars. I would definitely try this place again.",

She's immediately over with water and to inquire about appetizers - she was very attentive for the whole meal.  We got the chips and guac, which was good but definitely not the best I've had. The chips were a little too greasy, but still good.The guac was a good texture, but definitely could have had more flavor. For my entree, I had two tacos - one chorizo & potato, and one barbacoa. The barbacoa was really really good. The chorizo was alright - there was an interesting taste of cloves. Both were really full with rice and pico - sour cream & cheese optional. My tortillas fell apart before I even picked it up, but it was still tasty. My boyfriend had some pretty tasty tamales too. Only three stars because, although tasty and the service was good, the meal was not worth the $24 pre tip for lunch.  Definitely a bit overpriced. I probably won't be back just because there are so many other places that are just as good nearby that cost a lot less.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time! I finally got in there yesterday night and I'm already itching to go back.  It was a Sunday around 7:30 and the place was about half full. My friend and I were both first-timers, so we decided to sample a few appetizers together. We shared a pineapple tamal with the green sauce that was delicious. In retrospect I think I would have liked something with cheese better (bean and cheese/ spinach and cheese were two options of the day that I wished I had gone with), but the green sauce with the tamal was fantastic. I can't wait to try their different varieties in the future. At $4.95, I expect I'll order the tamal appetizer every time I come here.   We also shared the chile relleno appetizer, which was good but not too exciting. We got it with half green half mole sauce to try both. Their mole sauce is delicious and has a lot of depth of flavor, but the peppers themselves were underwhelming and there wasn't enough cheese for my taste. We still ate all. of it. I also got a mushroom taco, which sounds a bit strange but was actually delicious. My friend got the barbacoa taco and loved it. $3.25 is a great price for tacos.   The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the chips and salsa. I'm finally over the fact that you can't get complimentary chips and salsa at any Mexican place in the city limits (unlike most places I have been to outside the city), but when I pay for an item that many places are giving away for free, I expect to get a decent portion. Although it's only about $3, the portion of salsa they give you is really disappointing. It's a tiny little bowl that I think should actually qualify as more of a ramekin. No big deal overall though, just a lesson learned. Pictures on here seem to indicate that cheese and guac come in more appropriately sized bowls. I guess it's just the salsa.   Overall I loved it and I can't wait to go back and try something else. I actually wanted to go right back today, but they are closed on Mondays! bummer.",

Most importantly, the food was delicious!! We ordered the tacos and quesadillas for 100 people. It did not disappoint. All our guests raved about it, some even asking where we catered from.  I would really love to come into the restaurant and enjoy the food again!",

Tender meat with a a lot of flavor. I added their homemade spicy sauce which added a great kick.   It's byob too.   Lastly, over the top service.   Totally coming back.",

It's nice that you can sit down and relax, and the food is very excellent but it's no Las Palmas in the taco department, the taco's just aren't quite as flavorful, close but not quite. They also were very messy, both of my tacos fell apart on the first bite, that does not happen at Las Palamas, maybe the corn tortilla is more sturdy? These flour ones were doubled up as well. The enchiladas were very good, just not as much flavor in the mole or salsa verde sauce as I was hoping for. Definitely 1,000 times better than Tako. Service was okay, the girl was friendly but she kind of blew me off when I needed her the most, for a 2nd Mexicoke.",

My wife and I love Mexican food, and in the past our default restaurant had been El Camp Monroeville, which is not terrible but too salty in terms of both price and taste.  I first came to know La Palapa thru their stand at the now-defunct Public Market, and every since they have never failed to impress in terms of both food and people.  I love stopping by here on the way home from work, and picking up fajitas for my wife, and my usual Burrito Steelers for myself.  La Palapa is also very appreciative of their Armed Forces clientele.  For these and many more reasons I highly recommend stopping by if you haven't had the opportunity to yet.",

    "text": "La Palapa is the quintessential example of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant: a hole-in-the-wall with great food.  I visited last Sat. with a couple of friends after seeing a movie at the South Side Works cinema.  I tried a sample of the tamales at the Yelp Burgh Bash, and since then, had been wanting to try this place out, so the movie afforded a great opportunity for a visit.  Between three of us, we ordered the platter (\"charola\") para dos and an a la carte entree order of tamales.  The platter comes with the following items: taco, quesadilla, empanada, tamale, flauta, chicken, and ribs, plus rice and veggies.  In addition, I believe we were given an extra quesadilla.  We ordered a variety of different meats, including chicken, pork, and chorizo, as well as beans/peppers for the fillings.  Because there were so many different items, it's hard for me to remember the details, but most of them were very well-executed and delicious, with the standout being the tamales.  The only items we found lacking a bit were the taco (the chorizo's flavor was a bit off) and the empanada, whose filling I found a bit too liquidy, and my one friend found a bit too piquant.  One minor disappointment was that they were out of agua fresca (pineapple that day) and horchata by the time that we visited (around 8pm).  Since we hadn't brought any booze, we ordered Jarritos soda instead (lime for me, and orange and pineapple for my friends), which was good, but likely not as good as the freshly-made bebidas.  The ambiance in this place is exactly what I look for in a good hole-in-the-wall eatery, complete with interesting and culturally-appropriate decorations, music, and friendly service.  Given the hour at which we visited, the dining room was only 1/3-1/2 full, with one party of somewhat boisterous middle-aged women who'd taken advantage of the BYOB policy to the fullest comprising most of the diners.  Their fun didn't detract from ours, though, since they were pretty well-behaved, although it did make things more interesting--one of them bade us a rather obsequious goodbye on the way out.  We felt that the portions were generous and the prices were inexpensive.  In sum, if you're hungry for a quality and authentic Mexican meal at a good value in the South Side, check La Palapa out!  4.5 stars.",

We always order the guacamole and chips to start. The guacamole is delicious and rivals my favorite Pittsburgh guac, mad mex. The chips are clearly freshly made and deep fried, so they are a bit oily. I usually prefer less oily chips but these ones are good.   I have had the tacos and quesadillas, which are both very tasty. The chorizo is awesome and has some spiced potatoes mixed in, which I've never had before but really enjoyed.   On Tuesdays they have a special of 3 tacos for $7, which is basically like getting one for free. Even when they aren't running a special, it's very affordable for the portions you get.    Overall, very good. I'll continue to come back.",

Going there on a Sunday for lunch, there were a few other tables of people, but it wasn't super busy.  I ordered the tamales - chicken - which came with the best rice and beans I have ever had.  I am not sure what the spice was, but it was outstanding - flavorful and complex.  The dish arrived with two tamales - one with a mole sauce that had the perfect amount of heat and traditional mole taste and one with a green sauce that might have been my favorite - tomatillo and garlic and delicious.   My daughter liked the salsa so much she drank the cup - I'm not kidding and apologize to any of you that happened to be in there while she was doing it.   Z got the tortilla soup which was served with an egg.  I'd never had it with an egg, but it was better for it.  They should do a ton more soups because they are amazing.  He also got barbacoa which was fantastic - like Chipotle's but actually authentic tasting.   We will definitely be back.",

Our drinks came pretty quick, however we got lost in conversation and I looked at the time and realized it was 8:46 and still no chips and cheese. They already have both made, so obviously the bartender forgot.  After reminding her around 9pm our chips came out.  We had ordered our dinners around 8:30 but didn't receive those until 9:30. I got the combo churrasco platter with pork and chicken, and the pork is out of this world tender and flavorful.  Hands down some of the best pork I've ever had.  So that eased my frustrations. Something is clearly wrong with the service there...2 tables walked out while we were there without paying...the couple next to us at the bar waited 2 hours for their food and their appetizer came out AFTER their dinner! Hopefully they can improve their service to match their food.",

I ordered fajitas and they weren't greasy or covered in oil like you may find in other places. The food was pure, and the service was good. I'll be coming back again for sure :)",

Tacos with beef tongue and burrito Steeler had great flavor. They have a very extensive drink selection and the service was excellent! The guacamole is absolutely delicious and made fresh right at the table.",

    "text": "\"They told us to leave even we made a reservation with them on Saturday night.\"  We booked a table for 5 people on Saturday night 2/20/16 at 8 pm. We changed the plan of coming at 7 pm because when we called, they have no space available at 7 and want us to come at 8 pm. When we arrived, they told us that they don't have the chairs for us and want us to come back in an hour.   They told us that it is not their fault and they turn down people all the time. My question is, do you turn down people with reservation? How would you take a reservation but didn't reserve the table and chairs for the customers.   We would recommend the waiters not to be rude to the customers and told them to leave.",

It's a perfect place to meet with friends or for a date.  Once, they had a three piece band play live music.  The price is reasonable and the food is excellent.  I have been to La Palapa on a few occasions and I find the service is always excellent as well.  The servers are always willing to answer any questions I have and never seem impatient if you bring a large group.  I've tried a lot of different items on the menu but I liked the Chorizos Espanol I had on Friday evening.  I'll be going back, they've got a regular in me!",

I'd recommend the chicken mole poblano, as well as the enchiladas verdes, but prefer the beans option over the vegetables. The guacamole is good, and the agua fresca is refreshing.  La Palapa is a bike friendly business, and they had no problem with us dragging our huge jogging stroller in when they weren't busy and had room to park it. They have nice baby changing tables in the restroom.",

I've tried a lot of other places around town and they are all chain-equivalent at best (one unnamed other Mexican restaurant on Carson used white Velveeta as queso...).  Anyway, after a bit of digging we tried La Palapa and it was AMAZING.  I had the Chamuro and my wife had enchiladas.  Both of our dishes were so good, and the queso was fantastic!  We will absolutely return to La Palapa again, hopefully many more times!!!",

There are not a lot of tables so if you have a party of 4 or more they have to put tables and chairs together to make enough room to accommodate the party. That being said, people will have to wait outside until customers are ready to leave in order to get a table.",
