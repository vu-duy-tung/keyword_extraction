If you like thai food, this is definitely your place. The pad thai is legitimately the best pad thai I've ever had. They go on a 1 to 5 scale of spiciness, and I got a 2 (which is still fairly hot for me at least). The atmosphere is very relaxed and I've never seen more than 4 other people in here at any one time. Overall, I would say give it a shot if your looking for goof asian cuisine in the south hills.",

The staff always brings lovely conversation, as well as a smile, to my face! I love their pumpkin entrees, satay, spring rolls, fresh squeezed OJ, and pineapple fried rice. My Thai has a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere perfect for business meetings or a quick lunch break during the work day. I just ate there today for lunch during my break and it made my day! I highly recommend checking it out.",

The location is great. There is cheap parking behind the building (turn in by the post office) and there is basically floor to ceiling windows with great natural light that faces Liberty Avenue.   The service was good. All the employees were very polite and nice and stopped by frequently to make sure we were enjoying our food and had enough water. The food itself was very good. I had pineapple friend rice with chicken which was delicious. The lunch special is only $7.95 and I had enough to take home with me. It also came with a small side salad and a small egg role. I also got the crab rangoons. I thought they were good, but too sweet. They weren't bad and that is more of a personal taste thing that a cooking mistake.   I would highly recommend it. Two meals, an appetizer, and a tea came out to only $26 :)",

We have been looking for a decent Thai places in the South Hills and I think we found our favorite spot! We started with the pork dumplings as our appetizer and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing, so much flavor!  My husband got the pad thai with shrimp at level 5 (we like spice) and he said it was much better than our original favorite spot in the city.  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with tofu at a level 3.  It was spicy but a great flavorful spice.  The portion sizes were large so if you are looking to eat a lot of good Thai, this is the place!  We will absolutely be back there soon!",

Today, I had the pumpkin curry, spiciness level 1 (beware! The scale is 1-5 not 1-10, like most places!) and it was VERY good.  Just enough spice to catch my attention, and I could tell the pumpkin was fresh.  It was slightly al dente (can you describe squashes with this word?), maybe a tad bit too hard for my liking, but it was great.  I'd rather have too hard fresh pumpkin than pumpkin from a can.  The price for lunch - $7.95 - can't be beat!  Perfect portion sizes, and very attentive and friendly staff.  I'm excited to go back and try more menu items!",

My husband had the pumpkin curry and again it was good through the one at Nicki's Thai Kitchen is a bit better. It was not very busy but there was a lot of take out orders. I would go again, it would be a great place to watch a game and have some Thai food but it's not the best Thai I've ever had but it certainly was good. I do prefer the food down the road at Thai Spoon, but this place has a full bar and you're not crowded against the next table like you are at Thai Spoon.",

PROS - more classy than casual atmosphere. Seems to help justify that it's a little on the more expensive side.  - high-quality service. Constant water refills are a good thing.   - the hostesses, in traditional Thai garb, danced a traditional Thai dance every half hour. Really impressive and unique.   CONS - no kid menu options. They literally have no menu items to accommodate the typical limited palate of a kid under 10.  Even suggesting making buttered noodles (no butter) couldn't happen. This will really limit the # of visits we make. (But maybe they don't want kids as a part of their clientele...)",

I had an order of the House Fried Rice, which was bland and underwhelming. The mix of chicken and beef was nice, but I had a watery bite of shrimp that didn't taste cooked, and the rice needed a ton of soy sauce. I would never order this dish again.  My boyfriend had the Pad Thai, which he described as having \"no redeeming qualities.\"  The food didn't taste fresh, the flavors were bland, and the portions were small for the price.

    "text": "Greetings fellow Yelpers!! This is my first submission of a review. I have used Yelp for several years now to find, check in at, and leave tips for, some wonderful establishments. However my life has changed. I am dating a Yelp Elite now!! She has shared with me that if I ever wish to join her ranks then I must review. Challenge accepted!!  I chose to kick things off with My Thai for two reasons. One, I've only been there twice, and both occasions were with the Elite one. And two, on each of my visits I was blown away by not only the cood, but the calibre of service as well! I have two Thai dishes, Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry Chicken,  that are first to be checked off at any restaurant before I start bee bopping around on the menu. My first visit which was about six months ago found me up against the Pad Thai. It was not my favorite offering ever, that title still goes to Green Mango,  however it was much closer than I expected it to be. Unfortunately remembering that it was really good is about as much as I can share. It was half a year ago, and we eat out A LOT!!  We found ourselves back this past Friday and it was time to give their Green Curry a go. Let me start by saying they have a 1-5 heat scale which is a little new for me. I usually enjoy a 4 to 5 on a scale of 10, and was going to order a 3.  Boy am I glad that my lovely date talked me into getting a 2!! The heat was not overwhelming, but I fear it would have been at the next level. Everything about the meal was absolutely perfect! The first thing I noticed were the amazing colors. The broccoli, and green peppers were very vibrant and nicely complimented by the brownish purple tones of the bamboo shoots. And everything was pulled together by the bright white hue of the excellently prepared chicken! I will happily ecclaim that this was in fact the best Green Curry that I have been served, and I will return to enjoy it again! While the food is certainly the star of the show at My Thai their wonderful staff do everything they can to steal some of the spotlight. They are extremely friendly as well as attentive, plus they don't hesitate to give you a very informative input regarding your dish of choice. This visit as well as the dish deseves a 5+ stars rating! Overall My Thai is a solid 4 stars and we will not hesitate to return the next time we are in need of some Thai goodness!! I hope you find this review helpful!! Happy eating!",

Still, we wanted to try this place going by yelp ratings. We ordered - crispy spring rolls (shrimp, chicken and veggies) - it was just OK, there was no shrimp in the shrimp rolls. Crab Rangoon was good, I tried this dish for the first time, have to try at other places too. Then, we tried the Veggie Sampler, crispy egg plant was awesome; crispy tofu was good too. After that, we ordered Pad Thai (Chicken), Fried Rice (chicken) and veggie fried rice in entrees. It was again average and chicken was undercooked. Service was good and the lady attended us with care. Overall, an average dine out experience in Pittsburgh.",

We asked for a mild level of spiciness. It was the prefect balance of flavor and spice. My beef and broccoli was right on point. The fresh brewed iced tea was very refreshing. The service was great. This place is definitely worth trying!",

    "text": "I love to see good new restaurants in this area of the South Hills... Dormont is on a major upswing, in large part due to the small business owners.  My Thai should help.  The decor is really nice, and the place is big and open.  I am a bit concerned about the size of the place in relation to the # of people it has been drawing in -- diners will really need to start turning out for this place to last.  Overall, the food is quite good.  There is a touch of \"foodie-ness\" to the way they approach Thai food, which has its pros and cons.  There are a few surprises in their bites, from appetizers to mains, but the portions are a bit smaller than you would expect for what you are paying.  There is some strong competition in the area, just a couple of blocks away.  The food here may be on par and slightly more inventive, but the portions are a little smaller and about $2/plate more expensive.  I think they can command the $2/plate more, but they will need to up the amount of food they give you for that price.  For example, the appetizer sampler platter ($10) consisted of 2 very small spring rolls; 3 very small dumplings, and 3 medium-sized chicken satays --- with dipping sauce.  At the very least, the spring rolls should be bigger than a bite, and there should be more dumplings.  The sauces crushed the amount of food on the sampler.  Similarly, my main (seafood platter, $17) just didn't have enough \"stuff\" (even light on the veggies) to justify the price -- although the curry paste sauce was quite tasty and inventive.  Also, a middle-grade beer was $6 ... and it had quite a bit of foam on top.  All said, there's some strong potential here -- but they better fine-tune quickly.  Start by giving more for your money, and it might justify the cost.",

In fact I didn't have my glass of water below the 3/4 full line the entire time!   Ambience: The place had a weird smell almost of dirty mop water, but honestly that could have been a fluke and one time thing. There was one lady fully dressed up in a traditional outfit while the rest of the servers wore black on black.   Food: I had the red curry tofu, which lacked a bit of spice, and was skimpy on the eggplant. The girlfriend had a basil tofu with peppers, that dish looked a lot better than my curry however I couldn't try it because she gets it way to hot.  Overall for the price I would rather go to Thai Me Up in the Southside or Thai Spoon in Dormont, but this fits nicely into the Thai Pittsburgh makeup.",

The service is polite and friendly, as well as helpful if you are not a Thai regular. I had the Duck Curry.  My Son had Thai Noodle Curry.  The heat levels go from 1-5 and they will caution you accordingly. I rate my Curry at a solid 4.  My son is about the same...he asked for more heat after sampling, the wait staff was quick to remedy! They have a full battery, however I had the Jasmine tea, which was a great compliment to the meal. I look forward to trying their weekday lunch specials which include many different curries at under $8, including salad!  If you want a casual, authentic Thai experience that won't strip your budget, I highly recommend \"My Thai\".",

But their heat scale is a bit off from what I am used to. I am normally happy at a 4/5 out of 10 for Thai food at all the places in the city. So when I ordered by dinner I asked for a 4, but was told they use a scale from 0 to 5 rather than 0 to 10. Falling back to my undergrad Engineering math courses I calculated that half of four is two, so I went with the two on the spice level.  Well, to quote Jessie in Toy Story II--Sweet Mother of Abraham Lincoln!  I was unable to get past a few forks of my curry. I tried shaking the sauce off each piece, smothering it with rice, and even tried beer and Coca Cola, but I quickly gave up and finished the rice while sweat ran down my face. I declined a takeout box.  What I don't know is if this was a mistake or normal.  But if this is really what their two is supposed to be I cannot imagine what a 5 would have been.",

Especially since this is a place that specializes in Thai food. I mean, it's in the name. I placed a pick-up order. When I got there (between 6/6:30pm) the place was empty, besides one guy closing his tab at the bar.  First I ordered Satay Chicken, which is one of my favorite appetizers, next to Crab Rangoon. This was the worst Satay I've ever had. The chicken was marinated & cooked in a curry sauce, but it tasted rubbery. Satay is supposed to be accompanied with a curry peanut sauce, which when done right is magnificent. This sauce was globular. It looked disgusting. I mixed it around & tasted a bit. It was gross. They also served it with a Cucumber sauce, which looked liked diced cucumbers in a green watery sauce (pickled?). I didn't taste it. I just ate the chicken plain & was very disappointed.  Secondly, I ordered Panang Curry. The one thing they did that I liked was asked me, on a scale from 1-5, how hot would I like it. I have an above moderate threshold for heat, so I said 3. It was a good call. It got my attention but wasn't too much. This dish was not bad. Really good curry sauce. The vegetables tasted a little old though.  Overall, I don't think I would go back to this place again. The parking is very limited. They had my bag of food sitting on the bar, near the front door, instead of in the back, where it can stay warmer. They also gave me cocktail napkins. Cocktail napkins!!!!??? I feel embarrassed for them, when a traditional Chinese restaurant is more efficient at cooking & presenting Thai food than My Thai.",

    "text": "It's always encouraging to see an ill-reputed sports bar such as the not-missed Cip's give way to an affordable ethnic restaurant like the whimsically-named My Thai. Since it happened to just recently open near my birthday, I decided that My Thai would provide my takeout celebration meal, and it did with a round of fireworks.   The interiors are simply yet elegantly appointed. No traces of the location's past were visible. One could trick a friend into thinking that My Thai has been an institution in the community of Dormont for years based on the comforting atmosphere, agile service, and quality Asian fare.   Headed by Chef Suwannanan, My Thai's kitchen puts out a 60-dish phalanx of appetizers, soups, salad, and entrees that include pork, beef, and seafood items along with vegetarian platters. As is par for the course with these occasions, we ordered a banquet's worth of food and partook in our chosen delicacies.   A tanned Crispy Spring Roll started each one of us off with a crunch that was complimented by the almost cloying plum sauce. I chose shrimp to (amply) fill these savory cannoli from the Far East and was pleased to know that they were neither undercooked nor overdone and were deftly seasoned. A snack ideal for a summer afternoon on a Strip District corner, these quasi-eggrolls teased our snarling stomachs, igniting our appetites for what was to come.   Moist, corpulent stopples of pork and shrimp, the Steamed Dumplings were accompanied by a sweet and sour ginger sauce that was barely touched due to every single dough-wrapped nugget's wad of juicy, brackish umai.   The Shrimp Pad Thai demonstrated the house's knack for cooking seafood well, its flat noodles and egg debris adding richness while its green onion, bean sprouts and ground peanuts conveyed a mix of texture, earthiness, and heat. For many this is a staple. For me it could become a habit-forming treat.  The Duck Curry was another master class in exotic cuisine. Lumps of supple, succulent, roasted, pulled-apart water fowl bobbed about a stew of warm coconut milk and curry paste with carrot, peas, pineapple, tomatoes and basil. The sweetness of the root vegetable and tangy fruits complimented the creamy auburn sauce while the seeds and herb plucked chords of nuttiness and pungency.   A cornucopia of oceanic delights were central to the Seafood with Basil. Generous chunks of stir-fried tilapia, shrimp (it was Day of the Decapods in our house), scallop, scallion, and bell pepper were awash in a palate-enlivening garlic sauce along with udon-ish noodles. A feast in itself, the aromatic basil permeated the dish without overwhelming the natural tastes of the proteins.   With the equally enticing Thai Cuisine just blocks away, one can no longer consider Pittsburgh's South Hills to be devoid of culinary adventure, My Thai offering a pleasingly gastronomic glimpse into a part of the world that inches closer to Middle America each day.   P.S. For my father's sake, we played it safe in regards to the spiciness scale.",

    "text": "Really solid Thai food in the South Hills at last. I've been waiting for just such a place as this, and have had lunch here twice this week. My benchmark for good Thai is green curry with chicken, as it's my favorite, and their rendition delivers. A pet peeve of mine at some Thai restaurants is when the vegetables are not properly cooked...either underdone, or the cook chooses to cook all the veggies together, without considering that some veggies will cook faster than others. Here, the kitchen is paying attention to details like that, so the eggplant in this curry was meltingly tender, while the green beans, peppers and pea pods all had a satisfying crunch without being raw. The veggies were all cut into proper bite sized pieces too, so you can eat this curry with a spoon without having to saw away at anything. The chicken was perfection, and reminded me of silken chicken that you find at good Chinese restaurants; very tender and cooked through without being overdone. The green curry broth was creamy and rich with coconut milk, and my stated desired spice level (medium) was exactly as expected.   On my return visit I opted for the red curry with chicken, and was again not disappointed. I sampled the dumplings that my husband ordered and they were good, although I could tell they had been made ahead. I'd have given them 5 stars except for that, as these dumplings ( which are shaped like traditional shu mai) had a nice rich pork flavor, but the dumpling part had dried out a little.   Service is excellent; friendly to the point of deference and efficient. It looks like they have a full bar here, although the bottles on display were quite limited. I'll be returning here often.",

All were excellent and exceeded my expectations. This is coming from someone who has dined @ nicky's thai kitchen many times.  the flavor density of the cashew nut dish was amazing .  they've got it dialed in, just right , to my taste buds . the tom kha was neither too watery/thin nor mucky .  (some places like Thai spoon water the soups down much too much .)  Prices are high-ish but, this place is definetly 'better' than Thai Spoon, around the corner. the portion size of the tom kha soup was small .  nicky's thai kitchen gives you nearly twice the volume of soup for the same price .  the cashew nut stir-fry was on the skimpy/small side, as well .  True that this was a \"lunch special\" portion but , i'm a hungry American male and I like a big lunch . you pay nearly $5 more for the full-size entree portion ...   *parking* could be problematic if you're driving here because there is very limited on-street metered parking unless you get creative and find one of the residential streets to park on, some of which are one-way only .    despite these issues, i'm sure I will be back to dine, again and try other items on the menu which all looked good in words.   Dormont and the South PGH / South hills areas, in general are much better off with the addition of \"My Thai\" .",

I took my coat off but draped it Over my legs.  We ordered everything at once including Crab Rangoon, Tom Yum soup and Thai Noodle soup.    The shell to the Crab Rangoon were very light and crispy but the filling was overly salty. Even the sweetness if the sauce served with it didn't cut the salt. The Thai Noodle soup (with chicken) had NO flavor. I added the hot sauce they brought to the table if we wanted to add heat but it did nothing to ramp up the flavor. The Tom Yum soup (with beef) had a better flavor so I put some of that broth into the Thai Noodle to give it flavor.  I was very disappointed. I'm not sure if I will give them a second try or not. The one GOOD thing was the service.",

We got a sampler plate for an appetizer that included chicken satay skewers, spring rolls, and dumplings. All were delicious, but the dumplings were phenomenal. I would highly recommend these! For my main course, I got the pumpkin curry. I was happy to see this on the menu in the summertime because I love pumpkin and typically only see it on menus at Thai restaurants in the fall. This curry was AMAZING! The texture of the pumpkin was wonderful-it was tender and melted in my mouth. And the sauce was incredible. It was a creamy coconut sauce with a distinct tomato finish. The spice scale was 1-5, and I chose a 4. Even at 4, it was not incredibly spicy, but added just the right amount of kick to the curry. I ate the entire portion-I could not stop eating it!  I am so glad to have found another excellent Thai place in the area, and look forward to returning very soon.",

We even hung out 15 minutes after closing while they cleaned and counted the $ and they didn't say anything. There is a nice selection of drinks at a good price. The noodle dishes are all delicious, and most importantly their green curry is the best in the area!  Green curry with chicken, ask for extra veggies.",

Since I live in dormont - my go-to place for Thai Food will always be the \"Thai Spoon\" but since Thai Spoon was closed for renovation - we walked to My Thai. It's a pretty spacious place with a nice full bar in the middle  with a pretty good selection of beers and surrounded by some flat screen TVs.  I got the Duck Curry and my lady got the Pad Thai. The duck curry was okay - it seemed a little bland for my taste. However, the Pad thai was pretty good.  The price compared to Thai Spoon is bit cheaper and despite my 3 star I would still recommend giving this place a try.",

We both chose heat level 4, but ended up needing a few extra spoons of Thai chili, and hot sauce.  The Pad Thai looked really good, with tofu, and a mixture of vegetables. Daughter said it wasn't salty (like some other places), or mushy.  My Tom Yum Noodle Soup, was flavorful, and had a nice mixture of seafood (octopus rings, mussels, shrimp and pieces of fish. The broth was a blend of fish sauce, lemongrass, and or beef broth. Sweet, savory, and tangy if that makes sense. Overall yumminess, the noodles were rice noodles, nicely chewy and the bok choy bright green with freshness.   We shared the Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert, just let me eat sweet sticky rice with coconut milk every day.  The service was friendly, and the food hit the spot.",

The waitresses who work there are super nice, and the place consistently serves food quickly. It never seems too busy, so the servers are very attentive.  The pricing isn't too bad either--I would definitely recommend the pad Thai, the red curry, and the My Thai sampler. The pad Thai is some of the best in Pittsburgh!",

I felt this restaurant really cut corners with their food and the food quality was very low compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to, especially when compared to competitor Thai Spoon right down the street.    The Pad Thai was super dry and bland. Pineapple curry had a sprinkling of peas and carrots (the pre-chopped frozen kind) throughout what was mainly broth. Tofu was my protein of choice for both dishes and it was tough and chewy, which you could tell wasn't very fresh.   Considering there are other Thai restaurants in the area that have consistently delivered on quality and taste, I don't think I'll visit My Thai again.",

Our server did a great job and was so kind. We ordered spring rolls as an app. For entree, I decided on the cashew and went with chicken. Bobby went with the duck curry.  Our egg rolls were very good. My cashew chicken was good, but I wouldve liked more sauce. Bobbys duck curry was amazing. He loved it.  Our server was so kind the entire time. She boxed up our leftovers. I asked for extra sauce and she mentioned they are pre-portioned. The sauce was so delicious I wouldve loved more for my rice. No big deal I just wanted to note it.  We were too full for dessert, but our server told us what was offered. They had a few options which I cant remember, but more importantly they offer fried ice cream!   Great, authentic thai with excellent service. I highly recommend.",

I wish I could tell you exactly what it is, but I assume it's tied in with the culture.   The ladies came out a handful of times, in beautiful costumes (a different one each time!) and did dances for us. They were perfectly synced and entrancing to watch. I'd give the place lots of stars for this alone!  But let's get to the food. I always have to go with the traditional Pad Thai dish when I check a new place out. I love it loaded with veggies and shrimp. The dish was great! I asked for a touch of spice. While it really wasn't spicy at all, they did bring out extra spices which I was able to add for a little kick.   I love that they have a bar too (I know, I seem like a lush!). But the place down the street doesn't have one and there's not a lot of great restaurant and bar options around here, so this is perfect! Plus, the menu is good! I was able to get a delicious glass of Malbec for $6.50.   I'm so excited to make this my new spot, plus I get entertained as well!",

This seemed open at that hour and we walked in. It really is a lot nicer inside than it seems from the outside. We were promptly seated and ordered their vegetarian appetizer sampler to start with the papaya salad. Both were pretty good. The eggplant crisps are definitely recommended. Their menu is full of vegetarian options and nearly all their dishes can be made vegetarian! Yay! We ordered the green curry with vegetables for our main course and the Thai-basil fried rice. Their serving sizes are quite large and we ended up taking a lot of food home. I did think that a lot of their sauces, dips and even the curry tended towards the sweeter side..tasty though. I'm not sure if that was because we emphasized \"no spicy at all\" or if that's how it is. I'm definitely going back and checking out more items on their menu. Curry fried rice for one caught my eye! Also, don't miss their lemon ginger tea. It was the most soothing end to a great hearty meal on a cold night.",

I had Pineapple Chicken Curry, and it was just right. I think the pineapples helped me cool down between the hotter bites. My fabulous date had Pad Thai, and he had zero complaints. But then again, it was food, and the day of the week ended in Y, so he wouldn't complain about anything, haha!   The service was spot on, we walked in and immediately were sat. The server was quickly with us and brought water. The food arrived before we knew it, and we were enjoying our amazing dinner.  I would love to go back again, and try something different!

They are True to their spicy level, and I was ecstatic about it because many other places don't add enough spice.   Next I got an order of crab rangoons, which are my favorite food in the whole world. They were great! They were probably some of the best rangoons I have tried in a while, and the sauce that came with it made them even better.   I've said it once, and I'll say it again: Thai food is my favorite thing in the whole world. I am constantly trying to find new places to try out, and I'm really happy I found this place. I'm not sure if it quite measures up with my other two favorite Thai places, but it is definitely up there on my list now. I can't wait to come back to try out their curry dishes next time!",

I had a Thai Tea which was the highlight of my meal. My meal consisted of tofu, green peppers, and onions in a red sauce. The tofu was fried crispy and served in a pool of a tomato-based sauce with red pepper chili flakes. The tofu itself wasn't bad but the sauce was sickening. The sauce tasted like canned tomato puree mixed with a creamy product (coconut milk?) and doused with red pepper flakes. It was really un-appetizing and unnecessarily spicy. After a few bites I couldn't stomach any more and ended up throwing the whole meal away. Hopefully the rest of their menu is better but after how bad my Spicy Basil Leaf Tofu was I wouldn't try anything else.",

I also remember how quick and friendly the service was despite us being such a large group of people.  I remember having this amazing salad here with fresh papaya and herbs and how I loved the fresh and exotic toppings - quite possibly the best salad I've ever had. My one remark however is that their curries just aren't as good as Thai Spoon - just being honest - so if you really want curry I would go to Thai Spoon instead but this is still just a really great restaurant nonetheless and I would not hesitate to come here again!",

I don't get to eat Thai a lot, so I don't really know what its all about. I'm into trying new things, but I never know where to start with Thai food. I told the waitress about my dilemma- she was so kind and helpful and really explained the menu. She was very knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu! I love spicy food, so I decided to try the Panang Curry (one of her suggestions) with vegetables. I really liked it! The sauce was creamy and packed with flavor. My friend got the green curry, and that however, I did not like. My Thai was pretty great- I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic Thai food.",

They have a full bar unlike the other Thai option in Dormont, which can be a plus or minus, but always a nice option when you don't want to BYOB.   I would also like to note that these folks are fantastic neighbors to the residents around the restaurant. Not only have they beautified the street with a fantastic mural, but every year, at Christmas they gift the neighbors with gift cards to enjoy a meal on them.",

But as good as the food is, the service is even better. In fact, I can't think of any place in this price range that offers comparable service!  The waitresses are always friendly and competent, and the food is ready in short order.

Heat level on dishes is 1-5. I like spicy and 4 is perfect. I've never tried 5 but I don't think it would be unbearable. All of the appetizers are also good, especially the crab Rangoon, my fave app! They have a nice drink selection as well but I always get the coconut mojito. A must if you like mojitos. If you come during certain times, they also have dancing performances in the dining area. The dining area isn't too big and while it does get busy, I've never had to wait for a table. Prices are moderate. Approx $60 for my husband and I for 2 entrees, drinks, appetizer and dessert. If you're up for something new for dessert, go for he sticky rice with mango! I get it every time even when I'm already full!",

I love that on their 1-5 spice scale that their \"hot\" (level 3) is actually hot! Significantly spicy but you can still taste all the spice complexity. I am so tired of going to places with a 1-10 scale, and ordering an 8 and either getting something that is still super mild or something so hot you cannot taste the curry anymore. My Thai understands depths of flavor. Order their curry and you can't go wrong.",
