I know this restaurant has attracted lot of local people but being an Indian, I just cannot tolerate the quality and taste of food served here.  Me and my wife visited this restaurant for dinner on a Monday evening. We are vegetarians but am sure my non-vegetarian friends would have cursed more than am doing now.   Every dish was either toooooo oily or toooooo buttery ... the taste was same ranging from veg pakora to channa chat to malai kofta to Vegetable kuruma and even palak panneer was tasting the same...   The best i liked was raita and achar (pickle)... it was atleast edible and i enjoyed my raita rice towards the end of my main  course...   You would be surprised to hear from me, mango pudding was 200% thicker version of Mango lassi served in any Indian restaurant in US. And the jamun was probably prepared when my granny passed away 10 years back...   The restaurant is cramped and not enough space to walk around either.. In all, i really feel sad that Americans living here in Pittsburgh are tasting a False face of Indian cuisine... People please dont conclude this is Indian food.. write to me if you really want to try some good indian food.. I will suggest you good places...",

Awesome desserts. This place needs a lot more seating though. They probably need to  expand.  Staff are polite and calm.",

If you go for the buffet branch out a little and try their offerings other than standard chicken tikka masala/palak paneer...while those are both very good, it's worth your while to try things like the kadhi pakoda (a Punjabi curry consisting of chickpea dumplings in yogurt) and the chili chicken (an Indo-Chinese dish with chicken in a fiery sauce), as well as goat curry. Goat isn't scary--it tastes a lot like lamb, though a tad bonier. Sometimes they have idli and hakka noodles too--worth a try! I do not like their tandoori chicken at all--always too dry for me!  Service is a little brusque but I'm okay with that. They show music videos from Bollywood movies at least during lunch (haven't been for dinner since before their extensive renovation), which is a lot of fun. They also do an extensive catering business and have an attached banquet hall where I always see people having engagement parties. They also provided lunch for the Indian delegation to the G8, which should say something about Taj Mahal's place in the Indian food community in Pittsburgh.",

I think in general there tend to be many places that have what I'd call \"American Indian\" food, and this is great and all, but I'm a fan of authenticity. This place has both authentic food from multiple regions across the country, but also does them really, really well. I don't know if they ever have a menu, but I strongly encourage you to take a culinary tour of India with Taj Mahal.   The best thing I tried was the okra - I'm not always a fan of this veggie, and they had two different options, one with eggplant, and one solo but with lots of spice. Both were excellent. The naan was warm, fresh, and buttery. My dinner companions tried the goat curry and were raving about it! The chicken options were all very good. To top it all off, we ordered masala chai, which is EXCELLENT here! Do yourself a favor and get some chai!  If you are adventurous, they offer relatively mildly spiced options in many different styles. They would be a great place to take a vegetarian or vegan friend, too, since they are primarily vegetarian with vegan options. Bring a huge appetite, because they do not disappoint with quantity, and come on, it's a buffet!  Two huge thumbs up for the great job they do here! Worth the trip!",

Yes, it can be crowded, but can you blame everyone for wanting to eat at what is the best-tasting Indian restaurant in the burgh?  Buffet - plenty of vegetarian (and vegan, and gluten-free) options, and all clearly labeled. Honestly, that is so considerate. Everything from the humblest potato on up to the smoked and spiced eggplant is divine. Plenty of things I would have never tried otherwise, and even more pleasant surprises.  If you choose to eat during non-buffer hours, I would actually recommend it. You don't get to try everything, but anything I've ever ordered off the vegetarian menu has been amazing. It's a calmer atmosphere. Perfect for a date. Sure, the lighting is bright, but you can't have everything. Also, they serve the food to you with these little candle warmers (whatever those are called) that keep it hot the whole meal. And I can tell they make their own chutneys because every time I go, they taste a little different. Hint: what was the spiciest last time may not be what is the spiciest the next time, and that's the fun of it!  Finally, their service is often harried by people trying to get their hands on yummy food, but never unfriendly. If you go to the buffet, just embrace the chaos - it's worth it.",

    "text": "First off I have been coming here for years and feel terrible that this is my first review, if you ask anyone in my family they would prob say this is my favorite restaurant in Pgh. So I have been here for the buffet and ordered off the menu. The buffet is good to try new things and get a variety and the spice level is just right for all to enjoy. I do prefer a little more spice so I enjoy ordering form the menu which has never let me down. There menu is big but like I said I have always enjoyed all of the dishes I have tried. The Non-Vegetarian Thali and Vegetarian Thali are a good menu option if you want to try a variety of items. My husband loves their Lamb Vindaloo and I have had a few shrimp and fish dishes that were delish! If they have mango pudding on the buffet give it a try, actually if your there for the buffet give everything a little try you might just find a new favorite dish.",

    "text": "This is one of those times where I wish that Yelp would let me give two separate ratings, one for the service and one for the food. Because they were in such stark contrast with one another that it's hard to decide how I feel about my experience overall.  Allow me to explain. Quite simply, the food here was spectacular. This just may very well be the best Indian I've had in the 'Burgh (and I don't say that lightly, as I've enjoyed a lot of good Indian food here). We had chicken tikka masala, matar paneer and garlic naan. The tikka was mouthwatering. The chicken was cooked perfectly and maintained its moisture (dry chicken tends to be the downfall of a lot of tikkas). The sauce was creamy and silky, with a hint of sweetness and spice...I'm drooling just remembering this sauce! The matar paneer was equally delectable, with generous amounts of cheese and peas swimming in a flavorful, rich sauce. The piece de resistance was the garlic naan, which was perfectly cooked...buttery, simultaneously crispy and chewy, and just the right amount of fresh garlic dotting the top. It was the perfect sauce-sopping mechanism.  So yeah, the food was outstanding. Now cue the sad trombone...because the service was pretty terrible. :(  From start to finish, wildly inattentive is the only way I can describe the service. We were seated right away, but it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by with waters and to take our order. A food runner did drop off our meals pretty quickly, so I guess that was the one bright spot. However, one of the dishes they brought out was wrong -- we had originally ordered matar aloo, and instead they brought us matar paneer. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen, and we will pretty much eat anything Indian, so we decided just to eat the matar paneer (which turned out to be tasty, but it's not cool that they screwed up our order). We normally get our food pretty spicy, but we went rather tame that evening (5), and thank goodness we did, because our waters were never refilled the entire time we were there. No one came by to take away our plates or bring our check. After our meal, we just sat and sat and sat, wondering if anyone was ever going to approach our table again.The restaurant wasn't that busy (plenty of empty tables). I saw the employees/owners chatting with what I assume are regulars instead of attending to other tables. Anyway, so after about 30 minutes of just sitting there with empty plates (yes, 30 minutes...I'm a patient person, but 30 minutes is the equivalent of about 10 years when you're sitting at a restaurant with empty plates waiting for your server to come back to your table), I finally had to grab the attention of a waiter when one walked by (and it was not ours) and ask if we could have our check. A few minutes later, our waiter finally reappears with our bill (this is the first time he'd come back to our table since he took our order!) He says we can pay up front and then mumbles \"sorry for the poor service.\"   Uhh...thanks, I guess?  So if I had to rate the food, I'd give it more than 5 stars. And if I had to rate the service, I'd dip into the negatives. So I guess I'll just split the difference and go with a 3 overall.   Maybe someday I'll go back for take out, because the food really was super delicious, but I'm not sure about dining in again.",

Once my order was placed I was given crackers. After taking the first bite I realized little human hairs baked into the crackers. When I pointed out to the waiter that there were hairs in the crackers he proceeded to do his own investigation of the hairs at my table. No apologies. I should of left. It was late I was tired and hungry. The water was tap, no ice and in a dirty glass. Exactly one hour after I arrived I was still waiting to eat. I couldn't take it. I got up and left.

    "text": "This has to be some of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. It's only a few miles from my house, but of course taking the bus there involves a trip downtown and then back out... but I digress.  My friend and I went on a Monday night, forgetting it was buffet night, and were really excited about that. Everything was excellent. Bonus points for naan and samosas on the buffet table, and EXTRA bonus points for Indian Chinese -- Chilli Chicken was sitting there just waiting to be eaten. And lo, it was amazing.  Plenty of pakora, chicken tikka, goat curry, lots of dal, chana masala, and not one but two paneer dishes. The requisite chutneys were present, thankfully (because what's life without tamarind chutney?), along with raita and even hummus.  Dessert offerings included gulab jamun (my favorite), rice pudding (maybe also my favorite), and mango pudding (which could, in fact, be my favorite). There were also small pieces of cake(?) of a sort I've never had before; the tops were frosted in silver leaf and I'm pretty sure there was rosewater involved. Lots of rosewater. For $10 and a tip, it's really an unbeatable value.  During buffet time things are a bit crowded since the place isn't huge to begin with, but it's worth it.  I've also had takeaway: Samosa chaat, which was delicious and just right at a medium (5) spice level -- although I didn't detect any yogurt, which made me sad -- and chicken kulcha. The latter starred plenty of cilantro and was absolutely delicious.  4/11 GOBHI MANCHURIAN: Went for the buffet again recently and had a sweet and sour cauliflower dish, Gobhi Manchurian, from the Indo-Chinese menu. It was phenomenal. I thought it had quite a kick, but the BFF couldn't detect it; possibly to do with the distribution of peppers. After eating half a plate I was kind of tired of it, but I find myself craving it something fierce now.",

Besides being partial to this restaurant because it was my first exposure to a lifelong obsession with Indian food and culture, Taj Mahal is just plain delicious.  I am not usually a buffet sort of girl, but I make the exception for the lunch buffet here.  My favorite part of this buffet besides the low low price and the giant selection of delicious food?  The labels on each dish that designate whether or not it is vegetarian!  So helpful and easy.  Eating a sit-down dinner is even better than eating at the buffet.  While the restaurant's decor isn't the most charming, the service is always good and the food always amazing.  Even though I like my food fiery, I appreciate being asked how spicy I want my curry on a 1-to-10 scale, and my mom who hates spice appreciates this even more.  Faves from Taj Mahal- the perfectly puffy naan, the free papadum and chutney, the fresh mango lassis, and the paneer makhni.  Serving the dishes in platters with individual candles below to keep them warm is also a nice touch.",

Okay, the restaurant was under construction when we went there, so I'll assume that they are not at their best. Also, we arrived during the buffet (I, personally, hate buffets of any cuisine). Still, we gave it a shot.  The parking lot... REEKED of rotting garbage. Arriving and departing were both very unpleasant. The place is in progress, but it has a loud, cafeteria ambiance. I'd call it a dive, if it weren't for the unpleasant, bright, florescent lighting. Greeting was friendly, and we were seated quickly, but the table we were put at still had chunks of food over the tablecloth from a previous party. The buffet was illogically set up, so diners were dodging in and out of each other to get to food they wanted. The food was lukewarm or cold in parts, as if microwaved. Beyond that, it was just bland, bland, bland. The tray of nan stayed empty for most of the time that we were there.   We paid on the way out instead of the way in. It would have been very easy to skip on the check entirely, despite a man sitting by the buffet, like a vulture.   My mother won't be visiting again. I may try again some time in the future, but more likely, I'll go somewhere else.",

As we were waiting for the food the lady came back to us and said \"can you pay?\" Which I found extremely rude! After we paid she went to the only table that was there which was  a bunch of guys she told them to pay and leave because they're closed and it was only 9:55! She needs to get her attitude right before they lose their customers.",

I was very happy the first time I went here, and overate, which is just too easy to do. I have only been here for the lunch buffet, as I don't live close by and it's not convenient for me to, say, stop by for dinner some evening. I would have given The Taj 5 stars, but for my one complaint, which is that the food is high in fat and very rich, even for Indian food. Of course, this is what makes it taste so good, but at times they go too far. Other than that, the food is well prepared with obvious talent and care, and I do crave it between visits.",

A huge variety of appetizers and entrees, both vegetarian and meat based, that are not spiced too hot, and are well suited to the average American palate.  However, for those experienced in ethnic dining, or if you want something more adventurous, you may want to try ordering off the menu on a non-buffet night. I'd recommend the chicken biryani, lamb vindaloo, chicken seekh kebab and the garlic naan. Bon appetit!",

    "text": "Taj Mahal provided incredible food at our wedding this August. I was planning a wedding remotely from San Francisco, and heard only good things about Taj. Usha was so kind during both our food tastings--she had us taste the food to our heart's content and was really committed to making our event special. She delivered a customized menu--for example I really wanted coconut water at the wedding, and she made it happen and even put little custom stickers on the coconuts. Usha also served mango lassi and kulfi at our outdoor wedding so the guests could keep cool. She made a pasta dish for the few people who don't eat Indian food, and also served cupcakes in addition to Indian sweets.  We were at a venue that had a tandoor, so all the food was made on-site and was very fresh. If you get a chance, try the tandoori shrimp, mini-lamb chop, and pani poori. My favorite part of the wedding were the various stations during cocktail hour. Taj provided a chaat station, dosa station, kabab station, and pain-puri station. Usher's staff were  professional and friendly, and the food was presented very nicely.  After the wedding, we did find out from the wedding planner that the cocktail hour food was delayed, but neither us nor our families noticed since we were enjoying our coconuts! The only logistical negative was that we didn't have an official contract and everything was done via email. So, it was a little difficult to communicate all the menu details/allergies/ingredient list etc. via email.  Overall we want to give a huge thanks to Usha and team for our beautiful wedding. Many guests told us this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding, and I have to agree!",

Taj Mahal was definitely the best Indian food that I have ever had.  The manager greeted us a few minutes after we sat down and asked us \"What do you like and are you vegetarian?\" before providing his suggestions. We followed all of his suggestions and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   For an appetizer, we had the non-Veg platter which was a platter of chicken strips, shrimp, a Samosa and lamb. The samosa (filled with meat and not just veggies like I am used to) was the best of the platter to me. I thought that this platter was good but could do without it next time.  For entrees, we had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Manager's Special: Shrimp in a yellow peanut and almond sauce. Both were delicious! I have had the Chicken Tikka Masala a hundred times and always found it to be too tomato sauce-y for me however this version was much more creamy and tasted similar to a curry. I loved it! I was a little skeptical about how exactly shrimp in a peanut and almond sauce would taste but it was soo good! I would order again and again. We also ordered a side of Garlic Naan that tasted great dipped in the sauces of our entrees.  Overall this Indian food was delicious and the beat meal that I had in Pittsburgh. Go with the Manager's suggestions and you won't be disappointed.",

They gave us a plate of broken pappadums. It seems like they gave leftovers from a previous order. Seriously, if they are making fresh papas, then its not going to break on its own from the kitchen to the table. Either, they purposefully broke a plate of pappadums or they reheated leftovers.  They didn't come to get our order until 7:20. No one came. In fact, I had to wave at the only waitress to get her attention. My daughter had stuffed herself on papad by then. My son doesn't like papad, and he was steaming. So, we ordered an app, a rice and dal for the kids,  a naan and a curry.   The app came in 5 mins. It was 7:40 and the food hasn't arrived yet. My daughter was tired already, so I took her out, leaving my wife and son. If the curry was taking time, the least they could have done was get the dal for the kids. We suspect that they forgot about us.  My wife started complaining and they said that they had a huge party right before us, and the chef went on an extended break before our order. I had noticed the \"chef\" earlier. The \"chef\" is an old Indian auntie who can barely walk straight. I wonder how she can run a kitchen. Poor lady has to take a breather after a big party, which means everyone who follows goes hungry.   The \"chef\" might be a good cook, but she is not a chef. This place should hire a professional. The entire front of the restaurant is run by one waitress and busboy. They need more people to run a restaurant with 20 tables. At least hire more people on the Jul 4th weekend. The uncle who manages the front does nothing to help. He just shows up when its time to collect the money.",

When we were about to leave, I saw one of the waiters was taking back the leftover sauces and dips (that customers had eaten from) and poured them back into the large containers instead of throwing them away and replacing them with new ones. It was unbelievable to me that they were not even doing that back in the kitchen, but in full view of customers; not that it would be right either way. I am not the only person who is not interested in eating other people's leftovers.",

    "text": "Adding to my previous review which lauds the buffet for it's large variety and being offered as dinner buffet three times a week, ordering off of the menu is also good. Been eating here for 3 years and it appears that the food has recently gotten better. I don't know if they have a new chef but dishes seem to have a little bit more flavor.  One star deduction because when I ask for spicy it's never spicy. When I ask for 10/10 it's like a 3/10. I've tried everything from asking for 25/10 (I get funny looks) to having my Indian wife order my dish and I ( I'm a white person) order hers. This is because her dish at 8/10 is nearly always spicier than my dish at 10/10.  In their defense 3/4 of all Indian restaurants I've eaten at in my life seem afraid to really give you a wildly spicy dish when requested. Tamarind will not. Billu's Indian food truck is the best bet. You ask for spicy he promises that it will kick your ass in his words",

Although there were a grand total of two other occupied tables we sat for a while with no menus, water, etc.  After 15-20min we finally got water and ordered. The place starts seating some more tables while we wait for our food. I checked the time and realized we'd been sitting there for over an hour. I look around and notice pretty much all of the tables that came in after us have their entrees. We decide to leave.  Horrible service. We'll stick with Tamarind for North Hills Indian eats.",

We thought they'd have a buffet but they didn't so we decided not to go there but while in the parking lot changed our mind and went back inside.   After looking over the menu we chose the non-vegetarian platter and chicken vindaloo which was plenty for two to share. The platter came with so much food it was enough to make two meals. *check picture*   I don't remember everything that was on it but it all tasted great!! It was hot, fresh and delicious. Our waitress was very kind and accommodating convincing my husband to buy two beers instead of sticking to water. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an Indian lover.",

I'm a vegetarian so I can review only the vegetarian dishes and it's really satisfactory to have so many good veg dishes at one place. I decided to come here since on Saturday evening at 4.30 pm not many restaurants serve buffets. But for my good luck this place was open and we came here. The extra 9 miles drive was totally worth for their amazing food. In the starters we had spinach fries and potato pakora, both were crispy and tasty. For the main course there were around 9 vegetarian dishes and 5 non vegetarian dishes. All the vegetarian food was fresh and  tasted the way they are supposed to taste like in India. Matar paneer, kadhi, sambhar, spinach curry, veg jalfrezi, malai kofta all were very good. They had 4 desserts - Gulab Jamun, kheer, mango pudding and sooji halwa. And all were good but Gulab Jamun was exceptionally good and very soft. Overall very satisfied with the food, ambience and staff.",

This must be the BEST Indian buffet I had in Pittsburgh so far!  The atmosphere is very dynamic, bright, clean and family friendly. I came here for the $12 dinner buffet. There were so many choices to choose from and each dish was cooked to perfection--fresh ingredients and quick refills. I wanted to try a little bit of everything, but my stomach surrendered too soon. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have samosa though.   Overall, I highly recommend Taj Mahal to those with a passion for Indian cuisines and a huge appetite. Dinner buffets are only available Monday, Thursday and Saturday. I will definitely return here again in the near future to finish up some unfinished business (the other half of the buffet I didn't get to try).",

This one is down the street from where I live so it was next on my list.   First off the service was absolutely amazing. The gentleman there pulled out my chair for me when he stated us, was very attentive, and all around did an amazing job.   The menu is huge! Seriously so many options for each course! We started out with the vegetarian fried sampler. This had a good mix of options but I was most excited to try the fried cottage cheese. It seems super weird but it was actually pretty good! It's an odd texture but I would get it again.   I had been craving chicken tikka masala ever since I first had it, so I had to try it here for my main course. The food came out in about 20 minutes in these cool boat things that had a candle under the plate with the food in it so it kept it warm. I loved that, never seen it before so I thought it was an awesome touch! My food was super creamy and flavorful. I had the spice at a level 6 and it was just enough spice. I would order this again in a heartbeat!   I love that this is super close to me and on my way home. I am sure I will order from here again sometime soon!",

    "text": "I do love Indian food, however when I go there I tried order off the menu. I order off the menu and order to control the spiciness, some days the buffets really hot some days it's really mild. You do have to know their system of doing things in order to get in and out of there without a hitch. Like when you show up there's no place to stand but in the doorway and you have to tell them that you're there for them to find you a table. When you check out most the time you do not even have a bill, you just walk up to the gentleman at the cash register tell him what you ordered and that's it. They do offer a selection of alcohol and wine but you can also bring in your own bottle too.  Definitely expect it to be very cramped and for the staff to assume that you're getting the buffet. Al in all the food is good and so are the prices",

Taking the advice of other yelpers, we all decided to have the buffet and weren't disappointed in the least. There were many choices, both vegetarian and meat, from which to choose, including soups and desserts.  Naturally, some dishes are spicier than others, which makes for a nice treat for someone who like hot and spicy food.  While my companions were able to try nearly everything on the buffet, there were a few items that I was just too full to eat. (Next time!)  Over the course of the hour or so that we spent in the restaurant, I noticed that buffet items were constantly being replenished by the kitchen staff.  (This, I suppose, explains why all of the dishes I tried tasted fresh.)  My only complaint is that it took quite some time to order a glass of wine from the fully stocked bar.  The waitstaff seemed more interested in seating people than waiting tables, so I'm not sure how easy it would be to order off the regular menu on a busy evening.  Overall, it was a really enjoyable and delicious meal.  I'll definitely return for the buffet again.  TIP: You pay the gentleman sitting at the bar in the front of the restaurant, not your waiter.",

The food at the Taj is tasty, but it's extremely unhealthy ~ often swimming in butter/grease.  Not only that, but the spiciness of the dishes is often inconsistent from visit to visit.  I assume this has to do with different cooks on different days.    That said, the variety on the buffet is great and recently we have seen some new and interesting vegetable dishes added to the mix.  I would absolutely love to see samosa on the buffet more often.  It's rare and they're small, but it's like Christmas for my mouth when I see them.   Because of the greasiness and inconsistency, I don't really order off the menu, as I assume it would be much of the same and more expensive.  I got the vegetarian thali platter once and it was OK, but I could tell they took items from the buffet and put them on my plate.  If I had one wish, I would love to see the food at the Taj become a healthier.",

The korma was one of the best I've ever had. The Baingan Bhartha was delicious as well. Unfortunately the service was not up to par. I believe our server was a manger. He talked on his cellphone while he seated us, didn't refill our water at any time, and tried to convince my partner to order something different than what he wanted. Very odd. But, we love the food so we will definitely be returning.",

It's pretty heavy from dish to dish but overall very nicely seasoned and there is a terrific assortment of vegetarian, meat and dessert offerings.  I always have a really hard time deciding what to eat and never have enough room.  It's a really good problem to have.  I really like their new remodel and the service for the buffet is ok.  I would give them 4 stars but I had a really bad dinner there last night.  I, like others who have reviewed this place, had a poor dining experience when ordering from their ridiculously large menu.    To tell you the story of last night's dinner would just take me too long.  The vegetarian thali is listed incorrectly on the menu causing great confusion.  The food wasn't very good and the service was worse.  The place was packed on a Sunday night and they weren't handling it very well.  Why not just serve the buffet if you can't deliver on a menu table service?  There were certainly enough people there to support it.    They serve papad when you sit down with the standard trio of condiments.  You aren't supposed to take these from table to table.  They were a mess and had definitely been at someone else's table before they brought them to ours.    I am so beleaguered by last nights meal that I don't have the energy to expound on this review.  Just stick to the buffet and stay away otherwise is my counsel to you.",

I ordered the Goat Vindaloo -medium spicy and it was perfect for me meaning, there's a nice kick but my taste buds are still in tack when I leave the place. The Mango Lassi which is a yogurt/milk mixture flavored with mango... I really enjoyed it because it wasn't thick like a milk shake. This time, I decided to get the buffet instead of ordering from the menu... look at me, venturing out... hahah. The buffet was availale the first time as well but I hesitated because of a lunch experience I had at Tamarind. There lunch buffet wasn't very good and I was afraid that was the case here as well. I looked around and it looked like a lot of people were actually going to the buffet so I decided to go for it. The buffet was $12.99 - not bad at all considering, most dinner entrees are at least that much. You get naan, samosas, a number of vegetarian dishes and about 8 meat dishes from fish to chicken to goat. It was pretty good. We got there around 530 both times on a Monday and didn't have to wait but it started getting pretty crowded after 630. The servers were nice and polite, filled our water and cleared our plates promptly. I'm a fan and would definitely come back.",

The first 2 times we all ordered the Masala dosai. From the first visit to the second there was a big difference in the dosa texture, color, thickness and flavor, the fillings and the sambher soup it comes with. Each person at the table ordered different levels of spiciness yet all of the dosa and soups were made the same level. Oh well, I still ate it and it was delicious. Dosa are large so I took home leftovers...it was even spicier than the day before. In my experience this is usually the case with Indian cuisine.   On the third visit I was tempted to order another dosa to see what it would be like the 3rd time, but we arrived in time for the buffet. There were many choices and the room was packed! I enjoyed all the vegetarian options from chana masala and mattar paneer to malai kofta and dal. Plus they had amazing desserts...burfi! No one EVER has burfi! Of course I had the obligatory gulab jabun too!    The service isn't the star at Taj Mahal...the food is. If you keep that in mind and enjoy the cuisine you will come away satisfied. We will be back!  Maybe for the buffet but probably for another dosa!",

I was by myself and was seating at a rather awkward table right by the door which was fine because it was just me but it the other chair had been used, the door would have been bumping us constantly.  The buffet was really well stocked with more veg dishes than non-veg.  The naan was phenomenal, probably some of the best I've had outside India.  The only dish I didn't care for was the palak panner, usually one of my favorites but it had very little cheese and what was there was quite tough as if it had cooked too long when it was made.  The mattar paneer on the other hand was very good so not sure what happened to the other dish.  Everything was refilled at least once while I was there except for the goat curry which was pretty must a tray of bones so didn't get to try it.    Will definitely be back the next time I am in the area for my monthly Trader Joe's run from Youngstown.",

They make all the foods relatively mild in spice so it's not offensive to the standard white person in the area.

If you like your spice level at 5 or spicier, you might want to order directly from the menu.  Many diners around us ordered family style and the sizzling pans filled with curries tickled our taste buds.  Back the buffet for round two.

    "text": "We visited the Taj Mahal for the third time yesterday evening. It was a night when the buffet was available. The restaurant was packed. Parking is limited. There was one other couple waiting when we arrived. We waited about five minutes and 3-4 other groups came and filled the waiting area. We were pretty quickly seated after that (total wait time of less then five minutes).   Focus on Saturday evening is on keeping the buffet fresh.  We saw it refilled and refreshed several times in the 45 minutes or so we were there. Selection was incredible!  I think their palak paneer and chicken tikka massala are especially good.  They had a nice selection of vegetarian entrees (including aloo gohbi and some noodles) which I thought were delicious. They had goat curry and fish curry out, but I was too full to try those.   Desserts were great. The mango pudding is a treat, and my wife prefers the kheer here to Mother India in Morgantown.   It was crazy busy here last evening - if you are looking for a quiet, leisurely meal, probably this is not for you.  If you are looking for great food in a warm and busy environment, this is definitely for you. We've found coming earlier in the evening, they are less busy.  This is a great value and wonderful food.",

    "text": "We have been here a few times in the past for ordering off the menu as well as to eat from the buffet.  All of our visits were generally very nice (well, except for one waiter who tried to correct us when ordering, telling us to order something different cause we wouldn't like what we ordered), and we usually prefer the variety of their nice buffet which is now available every night.   Anyhow, we hadn't been in a few years, knew they had gone through a remodel, and wanted to use our B1G1 from the Entertainment book....so off we went on a Friday evening at 6:30PM.  First of all, the exterior is much nicer and the interior looks very similar but with a much-needed upgrade to this decade. It isn't overly fancy or sophisticated and you won't find an ambience where you are inclined to chill for a few hours (they don't have a bar, no surprise) but it is much improved and nice.  We seated ourselves and had prompt and friendly service for the whole meal. Water was always kept full and they quickly answered any questions we had about their MASSIVE new menu (probably 8-10 pages front and back).  You get a free plate of Papadum (some tasty thin crackers) with some dipping sauces/ flavors. We ordered the Naan bread basket (way too much for 2 people!, pretty buttery), Shrimp Saagwala (request 5 level heat), and  Chef's special Biryani. They were all delicious, very flavorful, nicely presented, and HUGE portions. The shrimp turned out to have little spice heat, but the Biryani was pretty darned spicy. We could only eat half the bread, and maybe half of each entree.  No issues with the Entertainment card, and both the server and the owner thanked us for coming in.  I do miss the communal tip jar at the door that they used to use, but everything else is still great.   Anytime I need some great affordable Indian food or want to hang out with the local NPR crowd (never seen so many long beards, tweed jackets, and hybrid cars in the North Hills in awhile), this will be where I go.",

I'm a sucker for Indian food -- and will eat Trader Joe's Chicken Tikki Masala when desperate -- but I also know good quality.  I saw Slumdog Millionaire, like, a hundred times.  Taj Mahal is okay.  3 stars.  The lunch buffet is a good spread with vegetarian options, chicken curry, goat curry, chicken tikki masala, tandoori chicken, saag, appetizers, and deserts.  But the food is only average -- I'm pretty disappointed with the tikki masala, because the chicken is dry and the sauce isn't that flavorful.  I know, I know, I said I eat Trader Joe's frozen dinners - but honestly, I think that has more flavor.  Mix up the goat curry with the saag - that was actually very tasty.  But for around $8-9, all you can eat, I'm pretty satisfied.  It is NOT great Indian food, but it is GOOD value, and should satisfy your craving.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying we are new to Indian cuisine. Not an adventurous diner, I had a surprisingly pleasant experience last spring with a friend at a restaurant in Oakland, and have been wanting to try more. I finally talked my husband into trying still another Indian place, using a Groupon, and he was also intrigued. We are always hearing about Taj Mahal from friends who are more familiar with the cuisine, so we finally made time to get there on a night when their famous buffet was available.   Frankly, I was a little disappointed. First, it was SO LOUD. There was a huge party of folks with a bunch of small kids who were running around, playing and yelling to each other. Kids will be kids, and I know that's not the restaurant's fault, but the noise level was a little unnerving. Conversation, unless we wanted to yell louder than the surrounding diners, was impossible. The greeting from the staff- and that's the best phrase I can find for it- was, well, weird. We had never been there before. We don't know what's expected- do you go find a seat? Do you wait to be seated? Do you grab a plate and jump in? What? A tall guy in a white chef's jacket kind of pointed at us from across the room, as we were standing uncertainly amongst people shoving to get out the door or to the buffet- and held up two fingers, asking how many were in our party. When we nodded, he then pointed in the direction of the back of the room. We kind of wandered back to what looked like an empty table. There was silverware and glasses, but the table looked as though it hadn't been wiped after the previous guest. We then sat for a bit until someone came and poured water for us, and said we could go to the buffet when ready. The buffet, though laden with delicious foods, was confusing and intimidating. We had to search for plates, which were in the middle of the line, so people are pushing around and reaching to get what they're looking for. Maybe that's just how buffets are done in Indian restaurants? As I said, we're new here. Eventually we both got an assortment of dishes to try, and the food was delicious. There were LOTS of choices, including desserts and breads, and everything was hot and freshly cooked. I really love chicken tikka masala, and the tray was almost empty when I got there, but a new tray came out soon. Everything was refilled constantly, fresh from the kitchen. I wanted to try a buffet so we could sample several things. That worked out well (though i really need to take notes next time so I remember what dishes I really liked!) The water glasses were magically refilled all the time, and I asked for a soda, which was delivered promptly. When we were finished, we sat for a while, unsure if the check would be brought to us or if we were to just pay at the counter- which seemed to be what others were doing. I think just having staff trained to pay attention and offer guidance when customers don't seem to know what to do or where to go would help a lot. And would their faces break if they cracked a smile? Sheesh!  I really, *really* wanted to love this place. I wanted to be able to agree with my friends who rave about it. But... well, not just yet. My husband isn't interested in going back but maybe I'll give it another try with those friends, see if we were just there on an off night.",

    "text": "We had been going to Taj Mahal for 11 years until tonight. Hundreds of dinners, all good. Tonight was the 11th anniversary of our relation to Pittsburgh, so we went to Taj Mahal to celebrate. Since we were last there, something changed. Maybe they sold the place. Maybe they changed chefs. I don't know. Regardless, what happened once we arrived was really unforgivable. First off, they got our order wrong. They brought an appetizer, and it was the wrong one. We corrected them, they brought another, and it was still wrong. We ate that one out of desperation. Then they brought the entrees. The taste of both if them was mediocre at best. They brought my wife's lassi, and that was pretty awful. My chicken korma had almost no korma sauce, served in a very shallow dish, a dish much smaller than my wife's tikka masala. I asked for more sauce, they said sure, but it never arrived. We decided to leave and pay the bill. I took the bill to the register, and the gentleman who had always been behind the register was there, as usual. He smiled when he saw me. I told him about the 11 year anniversary, he smiled again, and then I told him how awful the food was, how they got the order wrong, and how the portion was small. He didn't say anything. Now, there were any number of things he could have done. Apologize, offer to rip up the bill and comp the meal, ask me what it would take to get us to come back. Something. But he did nothing. He said nothing. He ran the bill, handed me the receipt and looked confused. It seemed like he was looking for someone to talk to, but I know that he is (or was) the owner. So I don't know what or who he was looking for. I paid the bill and left. We will NEVER be back. Very very disappointing.",

Not only is the food consistently lame - the vindaloo just average, the tikka masala lacking any savory quality at all, and the naan, OMG, I've had much better frozen from the Indian grocery and fresh from my toaster oven that there's!!! - but the Service has gone from bad to worse. Firstly, for some reason every time I order it takes a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen, no matter how busy the place is. And every time I come in, I'm always rushed to a table like there's some big hurry. But this time the lady that waited on us was very rude. When my friend asked her what was a popular dish there, she said everything on the menu is popular. No help or direction, which for the uninitiated can be confusing. Then, throughout the meal, she was barely attentive. When I asked one of the other servers for sugar for my ice tea, he seemed immediately offended that I interrupted him. And when he brought the sugar, he just abruptly dropped it on the table as he walk by and said the word sugar. Then at the end, it took forever for the lady to bring us the bill. Swift with bringing me my change, she actually came back and took her tip off the table before we left!",

As one in love with Indian cuisine, the Taj Mahal is surely as grand as it sounds.  The staff is all so nice and regularly freshen the buffet.  The decor consists of very beautiful embroidered cloth, adding to the warm ambience of the place.  The buffet offers typical delicacies like a vegetable korma and tikka masala, but offers such a variety and even some dishes I haven't had the chance to try at other restaurants or buffets.  The saag - as I love any green dish - was delicious and absolutely my favorite; paired well with naan of course.  There were some very tasty veggie dishes as well as fresh vegetables and spinach salad with an interesting sauce.  I didn't have a chance to try the dosas or coconut chutney but these dishes looked amazing!  The Taj Mahal also has a sweet dessert bar, including a very yummy mango pudding.  I'm looking forward to visiting again, perhaps ordering from their extensive and informative menu.  My father and I had a splendid time here - a satisfying meal to chat for hours over.",

I am constantly on the road for travel and  have eaten at many Indian restaurants in the northeast area. Some good, some bad, but this is by far the best I've ever had. The buffet offerings are plentiful, but don't confuse quantity with a lack of quality. I had the chicken vindaloo, chicken biryani and curry goat along with Basmati rice and it was all excellent (w/ fresh ingredients). Considering this, I didn't even touch the surface of what the buffet had to offer; and all for under $9 per lunch buffet! Wanted to sample more of their offerings, but I was stuffed from the meal that I had. if you are ever in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend going to Taj Mahal. You will not be disappointed by the food experience. D.",

    "text": "We went here because we were craving Indian food and were going to be in the area. We landed here on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. It was a buffet day, which was great because we'd never been to The Taj Mahal before and we were looking forward to trying all they had to offer. I haven't been in Pittsburgh long & I'm still on the hunt for a great Indian restaurant. The place was about 1/3 full, which we figured was a good sign. The food on the buffet was hot and fresh. There was a lot of variety and mostly the food was tasty, even if it wasn't as spicy as I would have hoped.   That said, I will never, ever go back. The service was absolutely awful! At first the hostess tried to seat us at a table where there was no way for me to get into the chair since it was so close to the table & chair behind it. The guy that was at the table nearby even gave the hostess a look that, to me, seemed to say, 'you're kidding, right?' At 5'4\" and under 150 pounds, I don't require much space, but there was no way I was going to squeeze into & out of that seat without bumping into the guy behind me every time I got up to go to the buffet. We asked for a different table, which didn't seem to be a huge problem, but the hostess was determined to seat us at a 2-seater even though the place wasn't even half full. The many tables that were waiting to be cleaned off made that impossible to do right away. Thus, we waited patiently for her to clean a table, even though we were standing by 3 perfectly clean (& set) 4-seater tables. After that, she was just plain rude to us. We sat down & waited for a while, but nobody came by to bring flatware or napkins or offer menus. So, we walked over to the buffet, helped ourselves, and picked up some flatware from a neighboring table. Still no drinks though... We grabbed a few glasses from a nearby table and put them on our table hoping that one of the people that kept walking through the dining area w/ water pitchers would fill them. Still no luck. That darn hostess, who was now pointedly ignoring us, even replaced the glasses on the table next to us & STILL DID NOT BRING US WATER or offer any drinks at all. It wasn't until I spotted a cart full of water pitcher and went to fill our glasses myself that an very kind, matronly woman offered to do it for me. We did get one table-side refill, but I eventually ended up going to get a water pitcher & bringing it to our table before we left. We were here 45 minutes, tops. We could not get out of there fast enough.  To round out the awful service, the place is filthy. The walls are dirty. The black tablecloths were covered in curry & various sauces. The salt & pepper shakers on our table looked like they hadn't been cleaned in ages (very glad we had no need of them). The buffet was clean & tidy! However, the floor was covered in food from one end of the restaurant to the other. Lastly, vacated tables sat there dirty for far too long. Tables that were waiting to be cleared when we came in were just getting cleared as we were paying our check.     The search for a great Indian restaurant continues.",

The selection was huge and they were able to keep everything fresh, filled and inviting. The crowd was very diverse and included many young Indian families with well behaved children. No offense intended - this is one of the ways I judge the authenticity of ethnic cuisine. There are plenty of tables ranging in size from two seats to round tables of 6-8. I tried a lamb and peas dish that tasted better than it looked. The baby eggplant was also yummy and the tofu with broccoli was a spicy surprise. The buffet staples did not disappoint. They had plenty of hot naan where the last two buffets brought it to the table after you were seated. They also had two other types of breads that I'm sorry not to be able to give a title to other that, yummy!",

    "text": "My best friend's husband hates Indian food, so when I visit from St. Louis, she's excited because it means she has an exotic dining partner. She found Taj Mahal in the Entertainment Book a year or two ago, so we've now been there several times. We've never actually used the Entertainment Book discount, though, because it's only good on regular menu meals - we usually get the buffet.  There are about 16 main dishes on the buffet, with about six of them vegetarian. Generally, there's a good mix of mild/moderately spicy, creamy/brothy, veg/starchy. During my most recent visit, the variety was a bit off. As a vegetarian, I could only choose between two dishes with bready/mealy balls (kafta?), and there were no red-orange sauces or paneer dishes. Thus, everything on my plate kind of looked and tasted the same, which wasn't awesome. The variety on the meat-lover side looked much better.   In addition to main dishes, the buffet also had fried doughnut batter rings, a cashew-eggplant thing, a soup and salad. Naan and rice were of course provided, too.  There usually are a couple of desserts available - rice/tapioca and galub jamun. I make a beeline for the galub jamun, as I'm a sucker for anything that tastes like syrup or honey. The dough balls are large, but they're airy enough to let the rose-honey syrup really soak in. Delicious.  The menu is quite extensive. There are two pages of vegetarian entrees alone. Next time, I'll likely eschew the buffet so that I can try specific dishes and take advantage of the buy-one-get-one offer in the Entertainment Book.  Water service is quite slow. I'm almost to the point of asking for two glasses immediately, as I tend to down water and hate eating starchy Indian food without it. I really wish Taj Mahal and other restaurants would just leave a carafe on the table, especially when everyone at the table is drinking water.  The restaurant itself has undergone renovation and expansion since I've been coming. There are several stalls in the restroom now, but the women's restroom smells really, really musty and mildewy.",

We were seated quickly and shown the buffet, but that was the extent of the service we received during our visit.    Indian food, but definition, is rather spicy, so we all made decent dents in our waters in no time.  However, it seemed that our table couldn't been seen by anyone even though we were in the middle of the restaurant.  Several times a waiter passed our table without a glance but continued to refill the waters of other tables.  My dad finally had to flag a waiter down so we could order drinks (no one had even come to our table to take our drink order) and to get refills on water.  It almost felt as though our table was invisible: we had to ask for refills, to have our plates cleared, and even how to pay how to pay.    I can honestly say I have no had such bad service at a restaurant before.  The fact that we were overlooked repeatedly while other customers received service was absolutely absurd.  We were by no means needy, rude, or loud.  In fact, I'd argue we were the exact opposite.  I doubt my family will return to this restaurant.  No matter how good the food was (and it definitely was good), the bad hospitality took away from it.  The food may be good, but it can't save the fact the service was horrendous.",

I was surprised by the number of tables that had four people, usually two couples.  There were also young couples and older couples which told me that the food seems to be enjoyed by all.  This told me that couples like their food enough to bring their couples-friends along.   I had a lamb vindaloo which was nice and spicy, as requested.  I liked my raita which is the one dish that varies widely from Indian restaurant to restaurant.  My garlic naan was the best that I've had in a long time.  I was very impressed wit the fact that the dishes (food and rice) came in a dish that was heated by a candle.  So when I dished my second helping it was still nice and warm.  The service was good. All in all, I had a nice meal and from the looks of things so did everyone else that was there.  The bathroom was pretty clean which was another good sign.",

I have to say that all the staff was very friendly and nice. Even though they gave us dirty (oily) food menus. I had to wash my hands after I touched it. - First of all, the restaurant is pretty small without any air circulation or fans. Many customers were ordering seekh kebabs that were brought on smoking plates, and the restaurant filled with white smoke and strong smell. I saw other people looking around for help (maybe someone could have opened the window). After almost ten minutes the smell was fading, and then another burning/smoking plate. This is where they lose 1 star. - The waiter (older man, he was very nice) did not write down any of our orders/requests. I know usually it's a bad sign because we have special requests that many people forget even when they do write it down. And yes, he forgot about our order and special requests. 2nd star off. - The food was so much below average. The onion naan (that was forgotten before, we received together with the bill) was very dry and I didn't like it. Rotti was extremely oily and looked unappetizing- we sent it away (many restaurants don't put any butter on top of rotti). Also Saag Paneer was very oily, even though it was flavourful. I ordered a side of cucumbers and they brought me something that looked like rubbish. It was almost grey colour, soft and looked like it was frozen before. I still tasted it and it was very bitter. I also sent it away. So, 3rd star off. - Also their washrooms were really filthy, dusty, spider webs, very unpleasant. So then I started thinking - what's in their kitchen...!? I was reading other reviews where a customer saw them putting leftover dips back into the large containers, instead of throwing away. I actually believe this is something they would do seeing how dirty their washrooms are. - This is definitely a place I will not return.",

When you walk in, a host will seat you, and place water cups on your table while you can go wander to the buffet line, grab like a plate or bowl or two and collect some food back to your table (DO NOT REUSE YOUR PLATES, THAT IS UNSANITARY). They have curry, rice, naan (it's like a flat bread), fruit, veggies, dessert, etc. I got to sample everything they offered and my favorite has got to be the chicken tikka masala. It tastes just like the curry back in SoCal so I don't need to worry about my friend and her Indian food cravings. To sop up the curry you can either get rice or naan (or none of the above if you just wanna eat the curry straight up). They have a vast selection of rice ranging from like spicy to plain, and their naan selection does not disappoint, all of them taste wonderful.  Try a little bit of everything and figure out what you like. I remember trying their goat curry it did taste good, but just a fair warning, just be careful not to put a huge spoonful in your mouth, there's a lot of bones, so be careful.  TL;DR Very delicious and legit Indian food in Pittsburgh. The absolute best. Lunch buffet is a great deal. Bring all your friends and family here! Help them stay in business till I get back please. They have great service.",

    "text": "Taj Mahal is my favorite Pittsburgh spot for Indian. Going on a day they offer the buffet serves as a great opportunity to try all kinds of dishes without committing to a full entree. The food is delicious and, while I'm not an expert, the recipes seem very authentic. Their chicken tikka masala is my favorite and, of course, you have to have some naan - it's worth trying the naan basket which offers several varieties.  I would definitely give Taj Mahal five stars based on the quality and taste of their food. However, I have had minor issues in the past with their basic customer service. They offer online ordering which is a nice convenience, but I have gone to pick up only to find they hadn't started my order or that my order would take significantly longer than I was told (one time waiting an additional 25 minutes in the restaurant). There have also been issues dining in - we once had a large party and there was a lot of confusion over paying the bills. I would not mention these if they were one-time issues, but these things seem to keep happening.  Honestly, these issues haven't stopped me from returning frequently to Taj Mahal. I'd like to see improvements with their customer service, but there is likely no incentive for them to improve since they are always very busy with lots of patrons. I'm not trying to knock them down; like I said, the food is wonderful. Definitely check them out for some fantastic tastes of India, but be aware you may hit a few bumps in your dining experience on the service side of things.",

Several people waiting to be seated while the staff walked past numerous times.   The plates weren't cleared for a long time.   No bill was brought to the table and after 10 minutes I had to flag down someone to ask. They just pointed to the register and nodded.     The buffet layout was cramped and ineffective.  People crowded and stepping over one another to get to the line.   I would go back for a pick up buffet. The food was really good just a bad dining experience.",

OK, mistakes happen, and the owner reached out personally to apologize. That's the right way to run a business!  So anyway the food at the Taj is consistently very good, and of course many many wonderful options for us veggies. My personal favorite is Chana Masala but lots of good stuff.  We look forward to our next visit... but Uber Eats is off the table :)",

Being an infrequent purveyor of Indian food, I needed a few meal suggestions from the server who was eager to help. After listening to her suggestions, I branched out on my own and tried something different.   I got the Chicken Mango Curry, Samosas and Butter Naan, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also stole some of my dinner date's Chicken Tikka Masala, which we were both unimpressed by its lacking flavor. We both got a 3 out of 10 on the spice scale which might as well have been a 1.  Overall, the atmosphere was nice (complete with Bollywood music videos on the TV), the wait staff was attentive and the price was reasonable. We both even get to relive our experience with leftovers!  They have a lunch buffet during the week and on Saturdays which I look forward to trying. I definitely recommend if you are looking for good Indian food in the North Hills.",

Their website lists their buffet hours and prices.   If you choose not to go the buffet route, I recommend one of their Special Combination Thali Platters, which also offer a variety for you to sample. During my last visit, I ordered the vegetarian platter and it was delicious. My husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it ranks as his favorite!   I honestly can go here again and again.

I was THRILLED to find this place a hop, skip and a jump from my apartment and even more thrilled to find that the food was AWESOME. I absolutely love a good Indian and this place hits the spot every time. I get take out here 2-3 times a month because I crave it constantly. Their chicken tikka is top notch and the samosas are just about perfect.   My only complaint is that the garlic naan bread is a bit soft, but their plain naan has a bit of crispiness to it that I love. I have yet to dine in, but it is the perfect week night take out if you're into tender meat spiced perfectly.",

When I entered with my partner, I was stunned to see the best buffet selection at an Indian restaurant ever. There was pav bhaji, which I've never seen before at an Indian buffet. There was even pani puri (although the pani is not on the same par as to what my Indian 5-star chef of a mother makes at home). And there was even malai kofta (my favorite Punjabi dish), which is rare to find at a lunch buffet. I took two plates and ate myself into a food coma. It was a great time with my partner. Indian food in Morgantown, WV never stood a chance.  Other thing I noticed that was very smart was how they covered the table with thick paper so that you wouldn't worry about spilling and getting the cloth tablespread dirty. The servers were quick with the water and friendly.  As far as to what could be better. The pani puri. But it's like asking Steph Curry why he didn't score 60 points and just 50 points. Great experience, and I can't wait to return.",

Went here with two friends cause we are all pretty inexperienced with Indian food but were curious. Decided we should go to a buffet to try a variety of things figuring we would at least find something we each liked and could explore several dishes for not a lot of money.  Everything was great! A lot of rice. A lot of chicken. Some goat. A lot of different sauces. All good.  There was some spice and heat to some dishes, but nothing unbearable. Good Naan bread. Like I said, I would just butcher the names, so I won't even try. Just know that for three guys that didn't have much experience with Indian food that we all really enjoyed it.  Dining room was nice and service was pretty good. The place was packed and there were only two servers to clear plates and refill water. We did go during Diwali so that is probably why.  I hope to get back again and explore Indian food some more!",

Vada is cooked well and had the right amount of oil that didn't make it greasy.   Coming to the entree, I liked the vegetarian options they offered. Especially paneer Tikka masala and brinjal curry are my favorites. I should say that the non-vegetarian options I tried disappointed me. I had biryani  which didn't seem to have any meat pieces in it and then the chicken tandoori tasted bland and lacked seasoning.   Finally the dessert items are a hit here. Especially the gulab jamun and mango pudding. Gulab jamun tastes just like homemade food with right amount of sweet. Mango pudding for me was just like mango lassi with a thick consistency.

Everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH and the service was great and friendly.  The inside is cheerful and the prices were super reasonable.  Flavor was complex and interesting; quality cuts of chicken; papadam and vegetables good and portions were good.  I have heard the buffet is great -- I think they only have that on weekends for lunch, but don't quote me on that.  Definitely the best Indian in Pittsburgh, despite the fact that it is on (horrible) McKnight Road -- only drawback.  I used Waze to take me there and it didn't know the exact location -- it is on the same side of the street and a few doors away from Mad Mex.  Also, all my Indian clientele say their desserts are fantastic and authentic, not like the other restaurants. I don't eat sugar/gluten so can't speak for it, but wanted to pass that info along.",

Simply put, this is a busy indian buffet the majority of the time. Lunch is cheaper than dinner and is quite a bargain. Basmati is always perfectly cooked, and samosas are hot and delectable. To say the spread is filling and wonderful is an understatement. Seriously, my eyes looked like someone who just got done buying tons of cat food at Wal Mart and just stepped into an Old Country Buffet, when I view this selection.  From Tikka Masala, to Korma, Goat and Chicken Curries, you will attempt to construct the leaning tower of Pisa on your plate, and wish there was some way you could get to all the different selections in one sitting.",

I have have been told by more than one person that \"The Taj Mahal\" is the place to go to get good indian food.   I don't pretend to be an expert but it's a good sign when you see people from that ethnic background eating at the restaurant. It's usually bad sign if you see too many white boys like me lurking around.   I can't remember what I ordered when I went here because the menu tends to confuse and never end. It seems they have listed pretty much every possible combination out on their menu but everything is delicious and authentic. You could pretty much order by closing your eyes and just pointing because everything sounds good and from my experience is good.     The place has gotten a few upgrades in recent months making it seem a little less \"hole in the wall\" but the food is the same and worth a trip. They have a buffet that they do at lunch I believe which is different, and something I will have to give a try at some point.",

The menu for the restaurant is huge; it's basically a book, including North Indian, South Indian, Indo-Chinese and more! The few times I've ordered from the menu, it took a very long time and the service was off (like we got our rice 10 minutes after our entrees and that sort of thing). Plus ordering one or two menu items is not nearly as exciting as the buffet, so in comparison, it makes no sense to come for anything but the awesome buffet. Note, dinner buffet is only offered on Mon., Thurs. and Sat. and is not to be missed!  The buffet is splendorous; with tons of variety, many vegetarian and vegan options and lots of extras, (like fresh naan, samosas, pakoras, sambar, pickles, desserts, multiple chutneys, sometimes dosas...things other buffets often skimp on). It's the most comprehensive Indian buffet I've ever seen. The spice levels vary from dish to dish and they will put out some medium spicy items here, which I love, while spice intolerant people should be warned. Much of the food is very greasy. I consider my occasional trips here to be indulgent, guilty pleasures.",

Now my review is 4 stars because I have nothing to compare it to.  The food was really good,  the portion sizes were great, their rice which is so frequently messed up, was cooked perfectly.  The naan bread or as I got kolacha I think it was called was super soft and delicate and beautiful, I want to try other favors.  The chicken chettinand was very nicely flavored, though the chicken was a bit dry, (common with a stewed chicken breast). Ultimately, worth trying out, good food, good price and I don't know that you could go wrong.",

But this place is incredibly amazing even for authentic Indian standards. I have taken many friends there and refer this place to every person who wants to try Indian food. If you are new to Indian food, do try their dinner buffet. It has a variety of options and helps you find out the flavors that appeal to you. And don't be overwhelmed by 240 different items on the menu. Just ask the host, he would definitely come up with some great options based on your preference. Not just the food, I simply love the hospitality of this place!",

The restaurant was renovated a year or two ago and looks a lot nicer post-renovation. Service has always been descent, and we've received our food relatively quickly. The menu is pretty extensive, but I've particularly enjoyed the Butter Naan and the Chicken Tikka Masala. They serve lunch buffet seven days/week and dinner buffet on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturday, which is a great way to try multiple Indian dishes. However, I recommend ordering an entree over the buffet based on the quality of the food. I hope to eat here again sometime soon!",

It was very reasonably priced, and unlike most restaurants, catered more to the vegetarian crowd than to the carnivores. The vegetarian selections outnumbered the meats by at least 4 to 1.   Most of the meat dishes were chicken based, although my favorite, hands down, was their goat curry. I highly highly recommend as being melt in your mouth tender and delicious. And, the vegetarian dishes were so tasty, I contemplated being vegetarian for a hot second until I tried their goat curry.   Don't leave without having for dessert their dumplings served in a delicious rose flavored syrup. I had to go back a second time for those. Two thumbs up for Taj Mahal's weekend brunch buffet.",

Every single thing I have tried has been absolutely delicious and satisfying, even at their buffet. Often buffet food isn't great, but at Taj Mahal, they seem to really spend time preparing each item they serve and they offer a really nice variety. It never seems like you are eating at a buffet because of how flavorful and high quality each of the options are. I've never been disappointed dining here.

However they sadly did not have samosas which are another favorite of mine. The tikka masala was great considering it's a buffet style. The flavor of the sauce is rich and just spicy enough and the chicken decent. The malai kofta was also great considering it's a buffet style. I've definitely had better at more upscale restaurants. Their naan was also fantastic. There are numerous other dishes that I did not have room for in my stomach.  There was a variety of desserts including mango pudding and the sweet rice. These desserts were just okay.   Overall, definitely one of the best Indian buffets I've had. Will come back next time I'm in the area.",

Our waitress was really nice but what I didn't like about the service was how they don't take your plates away until after you are completely done eating... I don't know about you but I don't like sitting at a table with my dirty plates piling up next to me. Especially since we were sitting at a small 2-person table, that was a bit of an inconvenience to me. I mean they were refilling our waters and everything, so it's not like they didn't see our plates.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place and hope to stop by again the next time I'm in the area!",

The prices are very affordable! For lunch Tuesday-Friday the buffet is only $9.99 and consists of so many different Indian dishes (&naan). There is also a nice variety of Indian beverages such as mango lassi and salty lassi.   The customer service is always wonderful and there is always someone that comes by quickly to clean your used plates. I love this place. It's always a treat to visit!",

You can easily drive past this place unless you know where it is (Right beyond Mad Mex and a Mattress store as you drive south on McKnight Road--before Ross Park Mall). They have a parking lot that fills up on weekend evenings, but you can park nearby without a problem.   I love the owners of this restaurant. They are charming and very pleasant. They visit the tables and make sure guests are happy. The waiters/waitresses are mostly attentive and friendly. We've had a few problems with not getting food we ordered or getting the wrong food. I chalk this up to the fact that the place is usually busy and little mistakes happen. They are quick and willing to correct mistakes.   There is a buffet that most people seem to opt for. I see people making multiple trips with plates piled with their fragrant, steaming choices. The aroma makes my mouth water! Smells so delicious! We typically order from the menu because I'm a big fan of leftovers, which (like all places) you can't take if you visit the buffet.  During our last visit, the three of us--without discussion with each other--all ordered the chicken tikka masala. Something must have inspired us (the aroma of someone else's food?) and it turned out to be a great choice. The sauce was creamy with the perfect amount of spices. Not too overwhelming, not at all bland. Our friend who accompanied us is 2nd generation Indian and she gives it her hearty approval. She has dinner here with her parents fairly often. The nan was warm and tender--great for scooping up those last bits of sauce.   Rather than eating at the many chain restaurants nearby, this is great choice for authentic Indian food. The service is prompt and the food is delicious. We always leave happy.",

I was very full after eating here and I felt healthy after eating here its all veggies and beans it was very filling and satisfying.   They have a good location near the mall so you can eat and then shop off the gain or you can shop to build an appetite and then eat. They have a lot for parking so thats nice. only con is that the location is small so you will feel crowded  if its busy. and the buffet hours are brief    I recommend to all my friends, and I'll def be coming back",

As a fist time goer in I was not sure if just sitting anywhere was ok or not. So i thought i will give 4 stars in hopes of seeing change next time when I visit this place. The food was good. Ate maybe few too many calories but i don't feel guilty. Anyway At the end I left tip for the busser. I paid and also left tip on the table for the busser. As i was exiting i saw the owner's wife taking the tip from the table. The restaurant is busy $5 will not make anyone rich yet don't understand why the hell she had to take the tip that was clearly meant for the worker not the owner. Very disappointed.",

We had a delicious dinner of Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tiki Masala.  The naan was delicious and well made.  The portions were very generous, and while the service was somewhat awkward, they were very nice.  They ask how spicy you prefer your food (important with older moms in tow), and it was prepared perfectly.  It was obvious that the staff knew several of the repeat customers.  Honestly, this is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh.  I need to remember this when I can't decide where to eat!",

The buffet was filled with a wide variety of dishes, such as goat curry, chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, palak paneer, channa masala... and tons of other delicious options.  While I am 100% carnivore, there were definitely plenty of vegetarian options available for those who don't eat things with faces and I didn't even miss the meat while eating them.  The service was excellent and they kept the buffet well-stocked but everything was hot and tasted fresh.  There was a decent amount of spice to the dishes but nothing to sweat over, so if you like your Indian food super spicy you may be better off ordering from the menu.  For anyone new to Indian food, they also give descriptions of what most of the dishes include along with the name.  I have not been to Taj Mahal for regular entrees, and if they are anything like the buffet then they are certainly worth a trip, but I would go back for the buffet any day.  It is unfortunate that they don't have it every day (they do for lunch, but dinner is only on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday) or I just might!",

There was a mix of Northern and Southern Indian dishes. The butter chicken sauce wasn't all that (I've had better at India Garden, Maharaja, and Tamarind) but the rest was so good (they even had fresh crispy masala dosa on the buffet!). The goat curry was very tasty. I'm never a fan of going to Indian restaurants for table service, because I like the variety of buffet, so I can't really comment on how dinner service might be. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated, and the service was not unfriendly, our empty plates were cleared promptly, and I was able to get immediate attention when I wanted some tea. I'm sure this will become a favorite when we're in the North Hills.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here with our 10 month old son for the weekend buffet. We were seated fairly quickly at the front of the restaurant. The buffet was delicious and adequate amounts of food were available.  The layout of the restaurant is cramped. If you are seated at the front of the restaurant like we were, you will be within two feet of anyone else trying to be seated. With large parties, this quickly becomes an exercise in how to avoid looking like a fool while scarfing down all of the Taj's delicious food. The cramped feeling is also felt due to the lack of spacing between tables. This is presumably to increase the seating count, but really, I think the experience could be improved by eliminating two tables.  Getting to the buffet from any table is tricky, again due to the cramped layout of the tables. The entry and exit point from the buffet line is at the same spot, and navigating with both a full plate and a child is not really possible unless you are a professional juggler.  Finally, service is average to sub-par. Our water glasses were refilled once. Perhaps this is to encourage a quick meal, but when eating such spicy food, better service should be rendered. I assume there would be a better experience during non-peak times.  All that being said, the food is the best Indian cuisine in the North Hills, and reasonably priced to boot. I would come here again, but not with my kid.",

I usually go to the Thursday night dinner buffet but I can also be found there any day that the buffet is open. The food is always fresh and they refill the food very frequently. So if there is not something that is there on your first pass through it is usually filled by the second time you go up.   I enjoy the pakora fritters the best. I just love dipping them in the yogurt, mint, and that sweet brown sauce. Then I head to the Chicken Tikka Masala and Goat Curry, spicy and so flavorful. And the one thing that I go up for over and over again, the Palak Paneer. Creamy spinach with cheese cubes cooked in it. I was always put off by this dish because it looks so green and chunky, but one day I braved my fear of it and got some. I have never looked back. This is amazing and so good AND good for you! Spinach is amazing. And their dish is not to be missed.",

I feel like everyone is entitled to have a bad day. I upped this review to 2 stars because the owner of the restaurant was kind enough to contact me and apologize for the bad service, an offer me a free meal on my next visit. I thought that was very nice and very classy and he credited the situation due to being understaffed. It was a very nice gesture. I'm not sure if I would go back, the food was good but I didn't mention that this was my third visit.

Did I get it? For the most part, yes. Could a few things be improved on? Admittedly, yes.  Here's why I say this. I LOVED the food here. Absolutely loved it, adored it, and happily devoured it. The samosas, my appetizer, were quite yummy and had the right mix of crunchy outside with well seasoned (but not overly mushy) potatoes and peas inside. For my main course I ordered the Malai Kofta, which consisted of tasty veggie balls in a creamy cheesy sauce. I actually wish I knew exactly what ingredients they put into the veggie balls, because they were REALLY good. This simple and super savory dish just melted in my mouth as I chewed it and the flavors of the vegetables with the creamy cheese and sauce blended perfectly, as good Indian food tends to do.  Really, the only area I really thought Taj Mahal could improve in is its service, and I kind of wonder of that's because of a cultural difference more than anything. I say this because our waiter (who may have been a manager, it was hard to tell) honestly came across as a little pushy when I was ordering. I had been curious if it would be possible to add meat to the dish I ordered, which was vegetarian. I really, really did want that particular dish (and am so glad I got it!), so my question was mostly out of curiosity - it wasn't a deciding factor or anything. But when I asked, the waiter seemed pretty appalled at my question and began repeatedly suggesting dishes from the meat-based options. They just didn't understand why I'd want to deviate from the main dish and took my question as, \"Oh you want THIS!\" I'm sure they were trying to be helpful, but it really came across as unnecessarily pushy and made me feel as if they weren't listening to me. Not a good thing to feel as a restaurant patron.  Any other problems my friend and I experienced during the night had more to do with the size of the place and its tables than anything. Taj Mahal admittedly goes for more seating, which is nice because more people can come in for dinner at once - but more seating equals smaller tables here. Personally, though, I'm willing to deal with the slightly crowded seating for the another meal here in the future, but their size is definitely something to keep in mind, especially if you're in a larger group.  While some parts of my meal here were more rocky than others, the food was amazing and I didn't find the service to be so terrible that I was overly offended or anything like that. With a few tweaks in their approach I'm sure there would be no problems at all on that front. So I will definitely be back in the future, hopefully to explore their buffet and sample even more of the delicious food they offer here.",

    "text": "Taj Mahal has a very good Indian buffet. First off, it has variety that other places can't even come close to. Seriously, you will be shocked by how many things the are that you actually want to eat.   Here's what I remember from my last visit to the Thursday night dinner buffet: goat curry, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, palak paneer, vegetable korma, dal makhni, channa masala, sambar, chilli chicken, indo-chinese style noodles, broccoli Manchurian, eggplant, minced paneer with cashews, naan, chaat masala, samosa, fried spinach salad, gulab jamun, kheer, mango pudding, semolina pudding, chutneys... Like no joke! It's insane! (Typing that list with predictive text fighting me every step of the way was exhausting, by the way.)   And not only do they have lots of food, it's all really good too. The old standbys like tikka masala and biryani are well-seasoned and nicely prepared, but I really like how they always feature some less-common dishes. For example, the paneer with cashew dish was totally new to me, and it was amazing. Super rich, as you might imagine, and almost meaty for the vegetarians out there. One time they had LAMB BIRYANI. On the buffet. That was a day to go down in history, it was so good. And I've never seen such good quality lamb on a buffet!  So, why not 5 stars? Well, a few reasons. Occasionally we have had pieces of chicken that just didn't taste right. Perhaps undercooked, or just a weird piece, but it has happened a couple of times. Mostly though, I'm deducting a star because Taj Mahal is just not a very comfortable place to dine. It's quite bright, even at dinner, when lower light or--dare I say it-- candles would be nice. The tables are extremely close together and can be wobbly. There are no booths and you feel very out-in-the-open wherever you sit. Generally the atmosphere doesn't lend itself to a nice, relaxing meal out, which is odd because it is decorated nicely and is going for a more upscale look. Now, this is no fault of the restaurant, but every single time I've eaten there, there has been at least one crying baby or screaming child. Every. Single. Time. While they can't banish the babies, it might help if they would open the back dining room when it's available to spread diners out more, or get some smaller tables so they can accommodate more patrons comfortably.   While the dining room isn't the most comfortable place on earth, you can be sure that won't stop me from enjoying the plethora of delicious dishes at Taj Mahal!",

This was a bit out of our way but we ended up enjoying the detour and felt it was worth it for the awesome food we found here.  The restaurant had a lot of people but staff was quick to seat us, provide us with water, and clear plates.  Food on the lunch buffet was delicious!  Some highlights were the fish curry (salmon), chicken tikka masala (so moist), zucchini with lentils (with the vegan options), and the best vegetable korma I have ever tried.  Not sure if we are just used to MD prices but 3 adults and 1 child for around $34 is a great deal.    Might have to take another detour for lunch on our next trip to the mid-west .",

Taj Mahal met the mark and had a great selection of dishes in a nice atmosphere.  The owner was very nice and met us at the door to arrange for our party of six and our waiter was very polite and quick with our drinks.  We went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty packed.  The only downside to the experience was the small size of the dining area and buffet tables.  It was very cramped and navigating around all the patrons at the buffet was annoying.  I wish they had more space, I was constantly saying \"excuse me\" as I bumped into others.  Overall, and excellent buffet at a decent price-I'll return again, maybe for lunch when it's less busy.",

He has since passed but my love for the food has not. This is the only place I found that even comes close to his cooking. It's flavorful delightful the bread is incredible and you can't go wrong. The buffet is a steal of a price and if you try it you won't be disappointed I can assure you of that! The chicken tikka and the chicken byrani are my favorite chicken dishes. Also if you are looking for veggie try the cashew sauce veggies I can't think of the name but they rock. Not to mention the veggie pakora!! If you are on the fence just go and eat to your hearts desire. Also the gulab little sugar donuts are great too!!",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised!  Let's be honest.  The name and the exterior appearance of Taj Mahal exude a cheesy vibe, no?  Shame on me for judging a book by its cover.  Under this roof is some tasty Indian food, but--here comes the disclaimer--I should note that my experience with Indian cuisine is limited.  If this is \"authentic,\" then I'm a fan of Indian food.  If this isn't the real deal, then I'm not sure I'm terribly interested in trying \"real\" Indian food at all!  The menu--extensive. The food--flavorful and high-quality. The portions--generous. The price--reasonable. The service--friendly...and slow.  Read on.  And the naan.  Ohhhh, the naan!  To die for.  Husband and I make it a point not to dine out if we're in a rush or a potential time crunch; I think it's rude to demand fast service at a non-fast-food restaurant.  Still, Taj Mahal gives a whole new meaning to the idea of a leisurely dining experience.  We actually chose to pay in cash and left a sizable tip so that we didn't have to wait for change or a credit card transaction.  Over 20 minutes must have passed from the time we confirmed we were ready for the check and when that check actually came, which prompted me to whisper to my guy, \"Babe, we can't ever come here if we're in a hurry...unless we're in a hurry for curry.\"  I know, I know.  Couldn't resist.  Can't wait to come back to try the lunch buffet, which is 10AM-3PM daily.",

My table wasn't cleared once during the entire time I was there (and given that etiquette is to get a clean plate each time you return to the buffet, there was rather a jumble of plates and condiment dishes).  My water glass was never re-filled.  I actually went to the service stand by the cash register twice in order to refill it myself. The bill is never brought to the table--but there's no signage to tell you this and certainly no wait staff will bother to inform you either.  You kind of pick up on the need to do this by noticing other customers in a queue at the cash register when they're done eating.  If you're looking for a reliable Indian buffet in the north hills area, this is a good place to go.  If you're hoping for attentive service, look elsewhere.",

The naan here is so amazing! I love the flavors, the waitstaff were very friendly, and the experience was great! We'll be back!",

The buffet gave me a chance to see what my favorite foods are there. I love their endless white rice, chili chicken is very yummy, love the chick peas, veggie somosas, pita bread, and mango pydding. The servers are a little slower to come back to your table even when not too busy, but they give you time to decide your order. Very friendly staff though.",

I look forward to returning, and exploring more of Taj Mahal's expansive menu.",

    "text": "I've tried MANY Indian restaraunts and the food at Taj Mahal is definitely the best of the best. The meats are tender and succulant. The sauces are rich and perfectly seasoned. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming. My ONLY complaint about this restaraunt is that the servers are often very slow and forgetful. For example, I've asked for coffee in the past and have literally never received it. I've often had to get up and retrieve my own extra napkins and takeout containers as well. It definitely hinders the \"eating out\" experience as I expect more from serving staff. The buffet is definitely the time to go as you can really enjoy a large variety of dishes. In addition, I've noticed that the wait staff is far less \"frazzled\" when they do not have to bring people's entrees to each table. I would LOVE it if they went back to having a buffet all of the time, however it is now only available on weekends during lunch. I know of many other Indian food lovers who are very upset about this change.",

    "text": "I did do a takeout at this place and frankly it was not my first choice. I ended up ordering from this restaurant only because Mintt was closed, it being a Monday. I ordered a Chicken Biryani (Spicy), Aloo(Potato) Kulcha, Chicken Hyderabad(Spicy).  I must say the food was beyond expectation as the previous buffet fiasco had set the bar too low. The Kulcha was soft and had ample filling of lightly spiced potato. The hyderabad chicken was spicy and flavorful. The gravy was rich and thick with the onions having been sauteed very well. The Biryani was also the right amount of spicy with good flavor. It was however Kacchi Biryani(Not the dum variety). I got some Jeera Rice with the chicken dish which was nothing out of the ordinary. The rice was a little crunchy though. The raita with the biryani was simple and effective. It took the richness away form the biryani, exactly what it is supposed to do.  All in all a very good experience. I had to wait a while though for the food to be ready, but if the food is this good I wouldn't mind waiting the 5 odd minutes.  One beef that I still have with this restaurant is the option of white/dark meat for the chicken dishes is not available. I do not like the breast pieces/ white meat of the chicken as it is less flavorful and absorbs less spices from the curry. Moreover it is also very chewy and not soft like the dark meat(thigh/legs).",
