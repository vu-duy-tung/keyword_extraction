    "text": "I liked it here so much that we went back twice in one week!  It is a great place to take a big group, kids and out of town friends/family.  They do not take reservations and it is seat yourself. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating at long wooden tables.  It gets very crowded on the weekends and for happy hour so be prepared to hunt for a table and wait in long food/drink lines.  On a late Thursday evening we had no trouble finding a spot and went right to the bar to order our drinks. They have a lot of great cocktails and local beers on tap. I went with my favorite, Full Pint T-Funk.  You then have 4 restaurant options to choose from each with their own ordering counter.  From sandwiches to tacos and Michigan style pizza Federal Galley has something for everyone. I was with two friends that are vegan and they were pleasantly surprised with all of the food options they had.  I ordered chips and guacamole plus a taco at the taco place. The tacos are very small so you definitely need more than just one.  The chips were the perfect amount of salty and not too greasy with very fresh guacamole.  On my next visit I went with the kielbasa sandwich from Super which comes with your choice of duck fat fries, chickpea fries or a salad. I am so glad I went with the salad as it had tons of toppings including tomatoes and quinoa plus a light vinaigrette dressing.  We will definitely be back!",

There is a large seating area around a central bar with four different restaurant options to choose from (my appreciation of how the menus were organized) - classic american, mexican fusion, pizza, and upscale brunch.  You could choose to get small plates from each or stick to one.  I ended up with the buffalo style cauliflower from the classic american and eggs benedict from the upscale brunch, both delicious options.  My only comment about the eggs benedict is they substituted the bread for eggplant, however, I would have opted for a consistency more closely aligned with the starch option.  This aside, the place is great for large groups of people as you individually order your food and pay at the counter.  Great young and fun vibe, highly recommend!",

Every time I order from the bar it feels like he's doing me a service taking my order.  He responds with venom if you ask him a question and it really seems like he just does not enjoy what he's doing.  I have had nothing but great experiences with every other server, but for him it really seems as if he is out to cause everyone to have a terrible experience.  If visiting federal galley avoid him at all costs and I promise you will have nothing but a great experience.",

There are 4 great concepts in one spot. It's like an incubator for great new talent. Basically you look at each chefs menu and order what you want. When you pay for it you get a number that you take to the table that you chose and they bring the food to you. Super simple and delicious!!! The space is verrrrry clean. It's a beautiful space that used to be a bank. The bar is set up where the old safe was - it's pretty cool.  The ceilings are high, creating a very open and urban feel. It's a bright space with tons of light.  The bar is amazing!  I love the featured drinks. They change periodically. And they have a great beer selection. I've been here for lunch only so far. I got a burge from provision. It was amazing!!!  My lunch mate had the pizza. It looked so good.  The menus are diverse and if it's like Smallman- sometimes they evolve over time based on feedback.  I'm planning to go again today. It will be hard to pass up the pizza but really there's so many choices....  I will say the I love the space but the way the tables are set up and how sparse the space is makes it feel just a bit like a cafeteria. I'll be interested to see how this changes over time.",

Provision provided a tasty burger and Sammy burger one with fries and one with a good side salad and housemade 1000 island.  The staff was friendly, delivered food to our tables and watched to provide fresh filled water bottles.  Followed up with brunch on Sunday with a lively World Cup energy and Supper was the star of the day along with the cheerful bar crew.  Definitely looking forward to our next visit.",

Business must be really good that they don't even want to work with 30+ ppl who will be eating and drinking at the establishment. Interesting.",

All in all, it's a nice place to grab a quick bite if you are looking for a variety of foods.",

But I like the layout of Federal galley so much better! The bar is an old bank vault located in the middle of the restaurant. It's open on both sides so helps keep with the very open feel. There are several glass garage doors that can be opened in the warmer months. We ordered from Provision (burger), El Lugar (tacos) and Supper (Brussels Sprouts and Poutine). My husband started eating before I could get pics, but everything wonderful. The tacos from El Lugar were my favorite. We will be back to try Michigan and Trumbull. It can be a little overwhelming to decide because everything sounds/looks/smells so good. Just get a drink and enjoy it!",

The pork pibil was a little dry but the chicken tinga was nicely seasoned. My husband had The Burger from Provision and he thought it was tasty but not the best burger he's ever had.

The octopus was tender and the tuna perfect. We also had a taste of the house made biscuits in gravy hollandaise sauce, incredible.  The creativity they offer will have us coming back. Our next trip we will try the other 2 kitchens.  Highly recommend.",

All one really needs is to really fall in love with one of the concepts and I did. I'm an absolute fan of Michigan and Trumbull's Detroit Style Pizza. One time I had the pizza for lunch, took the rest home and ate if for dinner so I'm okay that you can't buy pizza by the slice. The endless seating here makes this place perfect for groups and they don't take reservations. The other concepts didn't blow me away like the pizza but Provision Pittsburgh has pickled beets that are amazing as I don't like beets and they made me a believer. Supper had vegan ice cream that tastes like regular ice cream and I'm calling sorcery. El Lugar's guacamole left a lasting impression on me as I'm a guacamole snob. In summary just go to all the stations and order one thing from each concept and that's a meal.",

I was hoping that the Cotija cheese sprinkled on the beans would add some seasoning to the beans. The mere sprinkled of the cheese didn't add any additional seasoning.  The portion was small as well with little condiments served with the dish, just a tiny wedge of lime cut in 1/2 and a few cilantro leaves.  The taco plate plus a glass bottle (355ml) of Coca-cola cost me $18. I think they can do better than that.",

In the grand scheme of life, this isn't a huge deal, and mistakes happen. What ticked me off was how it was handled.  The main ingredient being kale, it would've been good business to either change the listing or remove it from the menu. The fella who took my order, (with only the faintest courtesy as it was), failed to mention the switch. It was the only thing I ordered, and there had been no line to distract him at the time.  Upon bringing this to the (*manager's?) attention, it was explained that there's a kale shortage, and it was replaced with field greens. I got a \"sorry\", accompanied by an unconcerned shrug.  But as this wasn't Burger King, I would've really appreciated an offer to switch out the dish for another, a refund, or even a complimentary slice of bread or something for the lack of communication.  I'm not looking for a handout, just service that fairly matches the atmosphere and prices. I'm also in the service industry, and I'd never treat a customer like that. I really hope Provision raises its hospitality game.",

    "text": "The concept here is so cool-you get to try food from several different restaurants with different styles of food all in 1 huge space. There is a ton of indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside on the back patio, which has a resort feel with umbrellas, lounge seating and a bar area. We tried food from all 3 of the restaurants-a buffalo chicken pizza, loaded nachos, and burgers and fries. The food was delicious, but super greasy. The cocktails were fabulous. This is the perfect spot to eat before or after a ball game because it's so close to PNC Park, and it's perfect for larger parties. It doesn't quite compare to Smallman Galley, but I'll be back to try more food.",

    "text": "After falling in love with Smallman Galley over the last couple years, I couldn't wait to try Federal Galley! I have been here twice -- once for drinks and a second time for a Yelp event. The environment is totally different from Smallman. Smallman has a tight, busy, gritty feel while Federal Galley is open, airy, industrial, and laid-back.  I really have to applaud the bar. They offer both excellent craft beer and also create amazing cocktails. I am not typically a fan of an Old Fashioned but love the version that they create here. The drinks have really surpassed my expectations!  Finally, regarding the food, I have only had Michigan & Trumbull pizza a couple times. Don't expect Iron Born pizza (like I did) as what they do here is similar yet different. My favorite pizza is the Packard Pepperoni, which is topped with an incredible mix of sweet and spicy, including the pickled chiles and hot honey. Their Teader Fries also shouldn't be missed, which taste like an amazing combination of BBQ chips meet Chick-Fil-A fries.  I am looking forward to returning to Federal Galley in the future and sampling more food from the other restaurants.",

    "text": "I'm losing my mind right now seeing all the five-star ratings on this page. Are you kidding me? I'm assuming that people are giving this place 5 stars because it looks nice inside and outside and I'll tell you what, that's True, but it stops there. Ok, the food looks nice too. And that's about all. I've eaten at all four restaurants and they are nothing to write home about. Actually no, I could write home about a meal that was okay. These meals were actually all pretty bad. The Mexican place for example, I had the tacos. These were a joke. While the plate looked really pretty, everything tasted like how I assume bland cat food would taste. The chicken had no seasoning, not even salt. Isn't this supposed to be Mexican food? Where is the cumin? the chili powder? the pepper??? Anything?? Come on at least let there be salt? No. Same went for the guac and the salsa. I'm guessing if you're somebody who just likes bland food you must like this place. so I'm assuming that everybody that's given this place five star reviews just likes to eat bland food. So if you like bland food you'll like this place too, but for the rest of us that are used to eating seasoned food with actual flavor of the cuisine you're expecting, stay away. Another time I had some burger thing from the burger place. I don't even remember what the burger tasted like so obviously it wasn't that good, but I'll tell you what I do remember, the oil fries. Fries that were clearly left in the deep fryer for way too long such that each fry was completely soaked and sogging with oil, and there was barely any actual potato left. I am getting annoyed just thinking about these past experiences and how this place got as high reviews as it has, so I'm not even going to bother with what I experienced at the other two restaurants. I'm just going to end with this. if you are somebody who likes food for the sake of your Instagram and you like to go \"out to eat\" for the sake of sitting somewhere festive and fun with your friends, then yeah, Federal galley is perfect! but if you're somebody who is actually looking to eat the food that somebody serves you and leave feeling satisfied in your belly and taste buds, then you should definitely, DEFINITELY, go somewhere else.",

Once you order, you take a number to your table where the server will deliver your food. When you are done eating, they will come take your glasses and dishes from you. You don't have a designated server. Everyone works together. You pay for your meal upfront at the specific restaurant you order at.   Seems like this place would be busy during the summer months!   This restaurant is more of a high end cafeteria and is so refreshing than the regular restaurant. Provides an alternative to still going  out to eat but not having to spend an arm and a leg.",

    "text": "I truly love this place so so much. We are so lucky to have not just one, but two of these incredible restaurant incubators + full bar concepts in Pittsburgh. If you've been to Smallman Galley in the Strip District, Federal is just the newer, bigger installment of the same concept. It's a little tucked away in the North Side but there are multiple entry points from both the front and back side. The back side has a huge, long grassy area and then a ton of outside seating, both long communal tables for shared seating, and also some larger chairs for lounging. The inside is a large, industrial type building with super high ceilings and exposed ductwork. Same idea as Smallman but isn't quite as jam-packed. Inside you'll find four different restaurant concepts, full bar with 20 + beers on draft, wine, and rotating cocktails. Order and seat yourself at one of the many large tables for communal seating. The four restaurants inside are all killer. Provision - which was an original concept in Smallman Galley - is now at Federal whipping up the same American fare: incredible fries, burgers, and sandwiches, just to name a few. Suuper is super super vegetarian and vegan friendly, with items like tofu scramble and falafel. Michigan & Trumbull is yet another Detroit style pizza and I cannot say enough incredible things about them. Their original vegan pie with the walnut romesco and eggplant was so delicious and unique, and now you can custom any pie vegan with their red sauce and endless toppings. This is the perfect place to accommodate larger groups, families with strollers, etc. The restaurant concepts continue to keep things interesting with new specials as well. Such an awesome addition to Pittsburgh and the North Side.",

Federal Galley is another win, like the Smallman Galley, you go up and order and then they bring you your food. We went on a Sunday, so it was not packed. I ordered a chicken sandwich from provision and it was AMAZING. It reminded me of chicken that I had at Pono Market in Kauai (which was my favorite thing ever). My husband got the pizza, it was similar to iron born, but a little more flavorful.  They were out of A LOT of the beers that were supposed to be on tap, which was really annoying, but overall great experience.",

    "text": "I described this place to my partner as a classy mall or school cafeteria. The environment and ambiance here is very minimalist and simple. It's the restaurants that are truly the stars here, at least at the place where I've eaten. I think that's exactly what the creators of this restaurant incubator wanted to do.  Getting to the best part: the food. I've eaten too many burgers to count in my life, but I have to say that \"The Burger\" I ate at Provision PGH was among the best.  That's right. It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my life. And it wasn't until after I got it that I knew it had a cult following.  I asked for it to be cooked medium. It was probably a little under cooked for medium, but it was the best mistake the could've made. The burger itself was filled with flavor, the toppings, with included cheddar, umami aioli, and smoked mushrooms, complemented this masterpiece. The fries I came with were delicious, seasoned with herbs I couldn't quite point out and amazing fry sauce, which I'm guessing has a thousand island dressing base but I'm not 100 percent sure. I may have also dipped my burger in that sauce a few times. It was tasty!  Lastly, the happy hour here is great. The deal is half off drinks from 4 to 6:30 p.m., so on my first visit I was able to get a cocktail for $5, and during the following visit, I got a Victory beer for $3.50. Normally I opt out of getting drinks out, but here I couldn't resist.  My biggest complaint is the location. I found it kind of odd I had to walk around weird concrete buildings. Street parking is the closest option, but it's still at least a five-minute walk to get there, unless there's another parking option I don't know about.",

They were cooked perfectly, crispy and brown on the outside and soft on the inside.  The burger was fantastic! Perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and a great balance of flavors. You do NOT need ketchup with these bad boys!  Overall, Federal Galley has a lot of new, fresh choices that all looked appetizing as I saw dishes pass by to other diners.

I am newly obsessed with Detroit-style pizza. Seriously cannot get enough. After trying out the wares at a Yelp Elite event recently, I had to return for more of what Michigan & Trumbull has to offer.  I ordered the St. Aubin Sausage pizza, an order of the Teader Fries, and the Garlic Knots.   The pizza featured some delicious sausage, broccoli, and red sauce. The crunch of the broccoli brought everything together and the fennel sausage had the perfect amount of spice.  The Teader Fries are out of the world--just like your favorite BBQ chip but better. But the best part is the house made ranch sauce for dipping. I want to bathe in that ranch. I want to top everything that I eat for the rest of my life with that ranch. If I drowned in that ranch I wouldn't even be mad about it.  Finally, the garlic knots. These would be better described as garlic rolls because they are much bigger than other garlic knots I've had. Doused in garlic butter, these garlic knots were out of this world. Perfectly golden brown but incredibly soft in the middle, if I could use one as a pillow at night I would, but in the morning it would be gone due to sleepy munching...  Michigan & Trumbull is fabulous! I'm going to be holding my breath for them to get their own brick and mortar restaurant and then I will live there.  Thank you, Federal Galley, for sharing amazing food with Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "I love this place. Absolutely LOVE it - and I keep coming back.  The set up of Federal Galley is, well, a galley. Much like Smallman, but far more spacious with ample room to move around and it's far easier to find seating. The bar is in the center of the layout and there are cafeteria style tables set up around and outside in the courtyard of Allegheny Center.   The pizza at Michigan & Trumbull is awesome and I absolutely recommend trying one of their specialty pies to really get a multitude of flavors. My favorite is the Packard Pepperoni - who would think to put honey on a pizza?  The tacos at El Lugar are great too. To get the full flavor experience I recommend getting the taco plate, with different meat on each of the three tacos.   And finally, my personal favorite - the item I keep going back for - the bahn mi at Provision. Wow this sandwich rocks. And the duck fat fries... the best fries I have EVER had. With pickles and jalapenos and crispy pork on the BEST BREAD, what's not to love?  Last I heard, the contracts for the four restaurants are only a year and I think they're coming up to that year. I'm not sure if they have all renewed them or not, but I recommend making the trip soon just in case!",

    "text": "To say that I'm excited about Federal Galley being open would be an understatement. It's about 3 feet from my apartment building and more convenient than I ever thought possible. I went with a group of friends and we ended up trying something from all of the four concept restaurants. It was easy to order and they give you a number to put on your table and then bring the food over to you when it's ready. The happy hour is also a fantastic deal considering it's 50% off beer, wine, and liquor from 4:30-6:30 every week day. Everything we ate was fantastic and I will most definitely be back again.  I had a Detroit style pizza from Michigan & Trumbull. It was delicious and the perfect size for one person. Not too big and not too small. For dessert we shared the tres leches cake from El Lugar, and wow. I think I have a new favorite dessert. If you haven't tried this yet, you definitely should.",

Some of the newly departed chefs from Smallman are here, for example,  Stephen Eldridge and Susan Cope from Provision.   We had a lot of fun ordering from mainly Provision and Supper. They both featured great vegetarian offerings.   The bar sure has some excellent craft beer on tap. I had a hard time deciding, but eventually settled on Dairy Potter, an American Double / Imperial Stout style beer brewed by Pizza Boy.   It's a very engaging dining experience, one that I highly recommend.   The high ceilings provide an expansive space, while Smallman Galley, especially in the bar area, can feel more cramped.   We had fun ordering dishes to share. I hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did ours.",

    "text": "It's opening day at Federal Galley and the place is already booming. The concept is similar in some ways to its sister establishment Smallman Galley but also different in its own way.  I got to meet with the general manager Geoff Zak who explained the concept and was very attentive to my needs. The Federal Galley works with established chefs as opposed to student chefs over at Smallman Galley. These chefs are not term limited and can renew their lease as often as they wish.  Set up right behind Nova Place in what used to be a former PNC bank building, \"the vault\" is used for the bar area. Happy hour starts at 4:30 and runs until 6:30. The bar hosts 25 craft beers,a Philippine inspired cocktail menu, and wine. Free WiFi is available here.  Let's meet the current chefs. First up is Provision Pittsburgh and El Lugar which is run by Stephen Eldrige and Susan Cope. Although this is the same Provision Pittsburgh that was part of the first \"class\" at Smallman Galley, Stephen told me that the menu has now completely changed and they are offering more sandwiches for lunch. From his love of the southwest he also runs El Lugar a Mexican concept using PA farm cheeses and other farm to table ingredients in his diverse menu.  I then got to chat with Kristen Calverley and Nate Peck, the main chefs at Michigan and Trumbull which specializes in Detroit style pizza but not the same as Iron Born over at Smallman. They also have a vegan pizza and eventually plan to go gluten free. Last, I had the opportunity to meet and chat with Vincent Perri from Supper.  His specialties are vegan and gluten free but regular meat items are on the menu as well. He told me he eventually wants to do catering. I saw all the restaurants had healthy options to their menus.  I decided eat from \"Supper\" I ordered a black bean veggie burger on a potato roll and a side of Brussel sprouts that included baked grapes and spicy pecans. Like Smallman Galley you are give a number to take to your table and can sit at any of the long tables with water bottles. I did ask Geoff about beverages and while the chefs offer their own beverages, there is no ice tea. There is no coffee place set up but they eventually hope to get a coffee bar.  I got my meal fairly quickly. The veggie burger was cooked to perfection but very messy!! Glad they have plenty of napkins! The Brussel sprouts were out of this world good. I was glancing at some of the other meals and yes take out is available. Everything looked so good!!!  I wanted to get a chocolate chip specialty cookie from Provision but time and my full stomach wouldn't allow it. I'm happy for this new concept and am looking forward to returning. Parking may be a bit of a problem since you are limited to street parking and the pay garage under Nova Place. Federal Galley also sits in front of the Children's Museum. They are open 7 days a week and offer brunch on Sunday",

Happy Hour is half off drinks, and who doesn't love that? I tried Wild Shrimp and Chicken Tinga tacos at El Lugar, which were quite tasty. I'll be back to try Supper, which I've heard great things about! This place is the perfect thing to open up in the area... A+ for Federal Galley!",

Not exactly sure how many different restaurants are in Federal but there has to be at least 5 or 6, plus a full bar as soon as you walk in. The dinning area is shared with all the restaurants, it's communal concept. They truly have something for everyone here. I'm vegan so I ordered the vegan pizza and it was delicious! I ordered from one place and my friend ordered from another. After you order you get a number then you pick a seat anywhere and they bring you the food when its ready. With so many different options there has to be something you will like, go check it out! Parking can be tricky but street parking only.",

    "text": "The newest addition to North Shore and Nova Place, Federal Galley is an incubator for chefs to display their culinary visions to the public. The concept is very unique: stop by any of the restaurants, place your order, pick up an order number, grab a drink from the bar (half off from 4:30-6:30pm daily!), and have a seat.   Upon entering, you're greeted with the warm glow of Edison lights and a spacious (I mean, really spacious) interior with a modern and rustic vibe. During my first visit, I grabbed a Pandan Express from the bar, a pepperoni Detroit styled pizza from Michigan & Trumbull, and a Tres Leches cake from El Lugar.   The drink was fantastic, strong, and quite inexpensive during happy hour ($5.50). We were all amazed at just how quickly the food came out. From ordering, it only took about 10 minutes for everyone's food to arrive! The pepperoni pizza was absolutely incredible. The dough in the middle was perfectly fluffy and light and the edges were crispy and lined with delicious caramelized cheese, and the pepperonis crisped and curled up into tiny little pep cups. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Lastly, the Tres Leches cake was absolutely divine - while it may look dry and dense at first glance, it is anything but. Soaked in dulce du leche and condensed sweetened milk, your taste buds will be enlightened with the strong vanilla notes and melt in your mouth cake texture...I know I'll have dreams about that Tres Leches tonight.  I can't wait to return to Federal Galley and try out everything else the restaurants have to offer - everything on all the menus looks very interesting, and after eyeing up everyone else's food in the Galley, it all looks incredibly delicious. The chefs are incredibly passionate about what they do, and you can tell from the friendliness, the time and effort they put into their food prep, the flavors, and especially the plating.",

I've had it on my list of places to try and I was thrilled when I got that opportunity with Yelp.   The place itself is tucked in behind the Children's museum and it can be a little confusing to find the first time. Upon entering there is a big open space with multiple tables, the 4 dining selection are off to your left, and the bar sits towards the back. I was instantly impressed with the set up of this spot. It was very modern and spacious.   While waiting for the event to begin we started with some drink samples which we were both very impressed with. They certainly aren't stingy with the alcohol! My personal favorite was the banana old fashioned. I'm a sucker for all things banana and I love a old fashioned. Who knew they could pair together so well?! I would definitely love to come back for their happy hour 4:30-6:30 some day with my coworkers.  While I had the chance to try something from all 4 places, there was one place that really stood out above the rest and that was Michigan & Trumbull. The pizza was so delicious that we ordered a pizza to take home with us. We clearly weren't the only ones with this idea because numerous people got in line to place an order as well. The pizza is seriously out of this world good. The thick dough with the caramelized cheese covering every inch of the pizza. I only tried the white pizza but I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to try the pepperoni.",

I'm a huge fan of the Federal Galley and Smallman Galley's concept- basically a food court for hardcore foodies. There's something for everyone, and there a tons of GF, vegan, and vegetarian options. All of the restaurants inside are super creative with their food.   First, I went crazy when I found out that Provision PGH would be at the Federal Galley. I had their food in the past at Smallman, and I was impressed. Of course I ordered there! I had the burger of the moment with a side of fries and dipping sauce. The burger was so juicy and flavorful that I could even eat it plain. The cheese and pork belly on top was excellent. There was also egg salad plus greens with a special sauce on the bottom of the burger. It was extravagant. The fries and dipping sauce ARE ADDICTING. If you're getting a sandwich or burger as your meal, then fries are an absolute must. I'm not much of a french fry or potato person, but these fries are incredible. The lentil fries are UNBELIEVABLE. Also a must have at Provision. Add a fried egg on top and boom you're set!! Thank me later. The pork belly appetizer was delicious too.   I was highly amazed by the food at Federal Galley. Next time I come here, I'll probably try the taco restaurant or something from Supper!",

The bartender with the beard is so unpleasant to deal with now that we won't even go in if we see him working. We don't cause problems. Usually we're in there when it's slow and I personally tip well because I was a bartender throughout college.   This guy is just a d*ck for absolutely no reason. The other bartenders are always great though.",

    "text": "Federal Galley is basically a sophisticated food court with a central bar and four food vendors. It's a massive open space and there are two big outdoor seating areas. We popped in for brunch and it was very busy with a mix of locals and tourists of all ages. You order and pay from the vendor of your choice and they bring the food to you, if you want drinks you order and pay for them at the bar and take them to your table. We did have to wait a little for our food once we had ordered it but when it did arrive we were very happy. We ordered from El Lugar, my husband had a chorizo omelette that came with roasted potatoes and homemade tortillas and I ordered a dish of that was a kind of cross between nachos and chilaquiles made with tomatillos, potatoes and black beans served with a sunny side egg. The portions were large and the prices were good. Federal Galley is I believe the sister business of Smallman Galley in the Strip District.  It's a great concept and I like that you could go with a group of people and all order a different style of food if you wanted to.  As well as Mexican, there is a pizza shop, a sandwich shop and a casual new American style counter - something for everyone!",

We understand that to serve alcohol you need to be sure you're following laws, but the manner in which you do so is up to you. Hipster bartender with a beard refused to serve my husband, fine, then proceeded to ignore me at the bar while serving my friend next to me under the guise of 'first come, first serve'. He then told me they were out of my selection, which I'm fairly certain was bogus. Unfortunately, the extremely poor experience with an arrogant bartender coupled with our mediocre food is not enough to bring us back for a second try. FYI: to the bartender who thinks he's an attorney, there is neither a \"right to drive\" nor a \"right to drink\".",

We ordered a cheese pizza from the pizza place. It is Detroit style. It had a very thick crust. It was four squares of pizza that was fresh made. The crust is dark and has a crispness. It tasted  like garlic bread. It is covered with cheese and then topped with sauce. It's some of the best pizza I've had. We got Pork Nachos from the Mexican place. It was a HUGE pile of Nachos. There were lots of toppings. The Pork was tender and tasty. I ordered biscuits and gravy as well as duck fat fries from Supper. We inhaled the duck fat fries. Yummm!  If you go you HAVE to try them. They come with a great dipping sauce but I ate them plain. The biscuits and gravy was ok. It had a sweetness to it that I couldn't identify. The gravy was on the thinner side. The biscuit was on the small side and very dense. It was really good.  We enjoyed the communal sitting and bought drinks from the bar. I talked with one of the young ladies who woks there. She said on Friday nights it is packed. She said that their patrons were more suburban types than hipsters. There were all types of people there including families.  We can't wait to go back and try more dishes.",

It seems odd to have an event in your entire venue on a busy going out night especially when Nova place has plenty of separate event space literally steps away. There's no place right next to the federal galley as a second option. It's one thing if there was an emergency but this was planned ahead of time and no accommodation made for customers coming in. It was on Facebook but who normally checks Facebook to see if there's an event going on at a restaurant? There were several other irritated people coming in at the same time as us and I wouldn't be shocked if they won't be back again either.",

The atmosphere is fun and convivial, and even though it was a bit loud (crowded with people having a great time), we had no trouble hearing each other. We're vegetarian, so we stuck with Supper and El Lugar, with slightly mixed results. From Supper, we chose the Vegan Press, which did not live up to its description.  The ingredients were meager and flavorless, and did not seem \"pressed,\" just sort of squashed (no pun intended).  From El Lugar, we selected the \"guac,\" the brussel sprouts, and the Veggie Picadillo Torta, all of which were delicious.  For dessert, I really wanted to try the ice cream sampler from Supper, especially the vegan banana peanut butter flavor.  The non-vegan ice creams were wonderful, but the vegan one was so salty, it was inedible, unfortunately.   The beer was fabulous.  I would totally visit again, there are so many choices.",

Even though it was closed yesterday there's a pretty big patio outside that I'm sure fills up with nicer weather. I would recommend a stop at this place for a night out in the north shore.",

We were the only ones on line and didn't get a greeting or any kind of chat as all.  Just doesn't really make sense to me. I would think that if you're trying to launch a restaurant concept that you'd want to explain to people your point of view, what you're looking to do... talk about the menu, etc. They really had no interest at all whether you were interested or not. Same with other vendors... Nobody on line and yet as you stand there they dont interact... A simple \"Hey there, what ya looking today... You should try our X.\" Or, \"Can I answer any questions?\" would be great. Oh well. Also parking is kind of hellish.",

I had a taco platter with chicken and fish tacos (3 tacos) and the guacamole. The guacamole was different - it has some fruit pieces in it! I really enjoyed it though. My friend has a pizza and was torn between two kinds. The woman at the cash register suggested getting both, half and half, and my friend was grateful for that suggestion! I'd definitely come back here again! Parking became an issue because there isn't a parking lot, but that didn't take away from the experience.

For dinner, we tried a couple of dinners from Supper and a dessert from Provision.   Supper's squash cavatelli was delicious.  The cavatelli felt more like gnocchi to me, but they were delicious all the same.   The dish was balanced and filling - I actually took 1/3 of it home and used it as a side dish for lunch the next day.    My friend ordered the vegan press sandwich with chick pea fries.   She found it very tasty and appreciated that they had purposeful vegan options (as opposed to dishes with stuff left off or random veggies thrown together).     For dessert, I tried the brownie sundae at Provision.  It was delicious and balanced as well.  Very sweet as far as desserts go, but I'm not much for sweets.  I also tried several cocktails and my companion sampled a few beers before settling on one she liked.  The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable.     Fours stars instead of five for two reasons.  First, we felt rushed out of there.  The website advertises that they are open until 9, but it was not even 8 when they started noisily stacking chairs and closing off whole tables near people eating.  Second, the \"suggested tips\" at each ordering station.  This is a trend that I really do not like in fast causal restaurants.  Tips are for service - and at the point where I am forced to tip, I have been provided essentially none of that.  If you aren't a full service restaurant (and even if you are), you should price your menu accordingly and provide fair wages - not expect a tip for service not given.",

    "text": "Check. This. Place. Out.   I've been to Smallman Galley in the Strip once for brunch (and it didn't disappoint, that's for sure!) Good options (yes, even for a vegetarian!)  Then I went to Federal Galley last Saturday for brunch. Had some trouble finding it (it's tucked away in the midst of some buildings). Once I found it (I'm directionally challenged, so you might not have as much trouble) I was in awe of the ambiance. Modern and contemporary, clean, open concept, trendy but not like their trying-too-hard. There was plenty of seating, even with a busy morning going on. The TVs had football going. Coffee was being brewed. Beers poured. Mimosas sipped. Scents of eggs + bacon spilling throughout. Pizza being cooked. Everything was intoxicating!   My mom and I split three different options from Supper because we just could not choose between them. We had an order of the French toast, Tofu Scramble with Quinoa, and the Vegan Press with Chickpea fries. Oh my gosh. The French toast was good, nothing really too special but it did satisy our sweet tooth!  The tofu scramble and vegan press...wow. Simply, the best vegetarian and vegan breakfast I've ever had. It was flavorful and simply so satisfying. Yeah, we ordered 3 meals and still I could've eaten probably a whole other vegan press and scramble because it was that. good.   The great thing about the Galley's is you order on your own time, but are still brought out your food in a relatively quick manner. There's no server so its just you and your company, which is really nice. It's casual for sure, but still a nice little outing and treat.   Go to this place! There's so many options, even beyond Supper. One of my favorite places I've been to in Pittsburgh thus far (and I've been here for 3 years now!)",

    "text": "Oh, Federal Galley- how I love thee.   This is new favorite place in the North Side. It's located in the old Allegheny Center Mall - it features 4 different restaurants in open concept social gathering hall.   The bar is the middle of the hall - it's literally an old bank vault. How cool is that? They feature amazing local craft brews, soft drinks, mixed drinks, and etc. There is also a counter on both sides where you can order a drink or gather with friends.   Federal Galley is so neat and clean. I love the simple design and layout. They are getting ready to open up their Bier Garden for the Spring/Summer. The Federal Galley staff as well as the restaurant staff are always so friendly.  It was my mom's first at Federal Galley - so we started with a Woodward White pizza from Michigan & Trumbull. It is simply the best. It is literally my favorite pizza.   We also ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos from El Lugar - they were very good. It came with pickled onions and jalapenos - we just took them off because we weren't a fan. The pulled pork & sauce was delicious. I've never had anything like it.   I'll be back again soon to Federal!",

We got the pork belly, crispy cauliflower and the grilled asparagus.  The pork belly was on a bed of kimchi and a few other vegetables. It was very flavorful and yummy.  The grilled asparagus was served with crumbly Mexican cheese and either an aioli or hollandaise sauce but the sauce that it was served with a smoked paprika was incredible. The flavor was amazing!!!  I think it also had some grilled amps with it as well. This was also a delicious dish!!!  Last but certainly not least was the crispy cauliflower!!!  The cauliflower had a little crunch and was accompanied by a spicy buffalo sauce, blue cheese crumbles and some pieces of celery. It was the hit of the table .....  I never made it to the other spots that there were there because well, I had to try these three things. I will be back!!!  Do yourself a favor and go try for yourself!!!  What a great experience !!",

The sandwich was pretty good, but not fried...it was just grilled maybe. It was a tad messy with the runny sauce, but the bun held up well. The fries on the other hand were sort of wretched in my opinion. The fries are double fried I think. Essentially they are fried till the insides taste hollow and they are all greasy. I felt gross afterwards.   Someone in the group did order the buffalo cauliflower and that was delicious.",

I like going because it's such an easy space to get around in--even if parking in the North Side is a gamble--and there are lots of options.  It's a pop-up incubator kind of establishment, although some of the resident restaurants seem to be clearly in it for the long term. I ain't mad about it, because I like what's there. (Try the french fries at Provision, btw, which are double fried and therefore at peak crisp perfection.)    Tables are long and some are more communal than others. (Think German Biergarten benches.) In the warmer months they have outdoor seating as well. Grab a drink from the bar, a sandwich from one place, a taco from another, and for goodness' sake, try the Woodward White pizza at Michigan & Trumbull. You're welcome.",

    "text": "I finally made it to Federal!   Today's visit was part of a work retreat. We arrived around 11:30. The space just opened so it was relatively quiet. Both patios were open and people were seated outside with drinks. My first impression is how large it is. I frequently visit Smallman Galley and anticipated it may resemble the space, but Federal is much larger! It's has the same great tables and menus to give you the same Galley feel.   The bar is really large and right in the middle of the space. They have over 30 beers on tap and a full cocktail and wine menu. The bartender was excellent providing suggestions and samples for each of us.   Federal has four restaurants to choose from. Options range from salads, to pizza, burritos, tacos, sandwiches.... you name it. I really enjoyed how many options were available. I think they menus are much larger here compared to Smallman. My coworker and I decided to split a pizza and tacos. We ordered the chorizo pizza. Incredible! I was doubtful I could love another pizza like I do Ironborn, but they are different pizzas for sure. I'm anxious to compared the red pies in the future. My tacos were chicken and beef. The tacos are small so order two at a time. I was happy with both. My favorite being the beef taco. It's not something I imagined I would favor, but extremely flavorful.   Overall, I was extremely surprised how much I liked it. I really, really love Smallman so I was hesitant to try Federal. While they are similar concepts, both spaces are completely different vibes. I can see myself going to Federal with large groups to enjoy time on the patio this summer.   My best advice is 1.) to park in the Nova place garage. Street Parking was hard to come by today. 2.) go with friends and try a bit of everything! My coworkers had amazing burgers and sandwiches that I cannot wait to go back and try. They also offer live music and a dog friendly patio.",

I wanted to try everything, but was recovering from eating a TON of food from a weekend getaway and kept my ordering to a minimum. I wanted to try a couple restaurants, so I tried Provision Pgh & El Lugar.   Provision Pgh- My boyfriend tried their fried chicken sandwich (without kimchi) and fries. He really liked the flavor in his sandwich, as well as the fries. I tried the crispy cauliflower. I loved the flavors in this dish, but felt the cauliflower could have definitely been a bit crispier. I also wasn't a fan of the bleu cheese, so I opted to get it on the side. Overall, the meals were good and we were pleased.  El Lugar- I tried their shrimp taco. The flavors were FRESH and so tasty. I really enjoyed it, although it was a bit small for the price point.   I am looking forward to coming back & trying out the other two restaurants!",

Food:  I tried Michigan and Trumbull's Detroit style pizza.  It's excellent. The Packard Pepperoni is a great diving in point, because it's fairly traditional. Don't be put off by the fact that it has honey on it. It works, and it's a fairly small flavor element. The cheese is thick and somehow a bit less dense, almost slightly fluffy. It all comes together with great dough and hot, flavorful tomato sauce.",

I finally made it to FG and have to say that I was disappointed.   The atmosphere is awesome, large open space. And I must say I am looking forward to when the weather breaks and I can bring my pup to the beer garden.  Drinks, were great. Beer was reasonably priced (even more so during happy hour) and I also had a craft cocktail which was tiny yet delicious. Bartender was super sweet as well.  Stop 1 - SUPPER Poutine was great. Even for a Canadian. (5 Star) Black bean veggie burger 1 star. I have never had a veggie burger this bad before. The almond queso was terrible.   Stop 2- MICHIGAN & TRUMBULL Vernor Vegan pizza... was what my hopes were so high for. The dough and crust, fantastic. Toppings were light and I really was not a fan of this pizza at all. The others look much better on the menu, but due to my diet this is the only one I could eat. Flavor was great but with how thick the dough/crust was there needed to be a little more topping wise - after eating this I just felt like I ate an entire loaf or bread.   Stop 3- El Lugar Dessert was fantastic. (TRES LECHES)",

The issue i have is that the individual spots are fairly pricey for the portions and for the quality. I really hope that they are still working out the kinks in their menus because its a new place. That being said, I would say all the food (we tried 3 out of the 4 places) were severly mediocre. The pizza place was detroit style, similar to the chef at Smallman -- i got 3/4 of the pizza at the same price, less thick and undercooked. The mexican place, i wanted to love. The menu sounded amazing. If you are going to make tortillas from scratch, you better kill it! They unfortunately were subpar and thick. like...very bad. Brisket was dry. Provisions was okay. We got some dippy eggs for my son but the toast was drowning in butter and bacon was super greasy. Perhaps the chefs just need a little time to work out the kinks...",

Great experience- ate from two of the four offerings (can't remember names, but the 1st and the 4th as you walk in from side with garage doors). Food was lovely, people were nice, place was kid friendly and it just so happened to be happy hour.  I can't remember the last time I paid $2 for a draft beer. And it was excellent. Totally dug this place. I've been to other places in this 'format' (multiple eateries under one roof with a central bar), and this place seems to function a little more smoothly.",

The steak was over cooked     The Brussels sprouts were burnt, and the compote was a spoonful of pureed baby food. The duck fat fries would have been good but they were cold! I can't believe that I paid $23 dollars plus prepaid tip! The tip is before the whole experience! And to top it off we kept getting interrupted by the servers trying to deliver us other people's food. The servers seemed to be very confused were the food was supposed to go. The whole experience was sad to say the least. I would expect that a place so new would try and put their best foot forward, but alas, it fell quite short of expectations. I will not be making a trip back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Right now I really enjoy the mix of restaurant concepts they have in there. It is a good something for everyone variety. We got a bahn mi and some provision fries from Provision. I would love to come back and try the pizza and tacos as well. The interior has plenty of tables, but gets pretty crowded for happy hour and dinner rush. The nice thing about this place though is that you seat yourself so you usually don't have to wait too long if you're keeping an eye on the tables and which ones might be clearing out soon. My only complaint about this place is that it is LOUD. We were there during happy hour and it was loud, which isn't unusual, but after the crowds died down around 8:30-9 it still seemed really loud in there. It actually was one of the reasons we decided to leave instead of hanging out longer. The ceilings are really high and there isn't really anything soft in there to catch the sound, so it just bounces around all over the place.",

    "text": "I have been a respectable patron of this restaurant concept, especially since it's a new, unique local eatery for quite some time, until today. There is a weekly food truck roundup held at the building complex, so my friend and I purchased our food from a truck vendor, then went to Federal Galley for a glass of wine/beer. After we ordered our drink, with our vendor food in hand for nearly 20 minutes, we found a place to sit inside. Within minutes a server approached us and said we are required to leave due to health reasons of outside food being brought in. No problem. I ask her what she suggests we should do since we have drinks that are not allowed to leave the premise and the bartender clearly saw we had food from another vendor & said nothing, she said \"I don't know, but you can't stay here\". She waited until we left our seats; rather embarrassed (to say the least), my friend and I had a few sips of our drinks outside, then noticed the server circling us as well as a few other customers in the same scenario, making us uncomfortable enough to leave.  I will no longer be a customer due to the disrespectful service and will be sure to let neighbors know of this unprofessionally run establishment.  In addition, there are dogs allowed on the outer premise of the restaurant, which I think is wonderful, but please don't be hypocrites and state that for 'health' reasons we can't bring outside food in but dogs are allowed to do their business and sit on benches within the confines of the restaurant. There were also numerous employees outside smoking...if you're going to implement standards, please make it universal.  Please note this is nothing to do with the food vendors inside of the restaurant, just the poorly managed Federal Galley staff.",

Went down to FG to watch the National Championship and to grab some grub.  The food was cold and is still eating at my stomach today.  Beer selection was like it was handpicked from a hipster in Silverlake who makes his own brew from pomegranates.  Not one single, you know, BEER.  Everything infused with bee pollen or angels wings or henna or whatever.  All that I tried tasted just.....off.  I can deal with that, though.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  What sucked was that staff was chock full of attitude and rude as can be.  Guy who took my order acted like I was keeping him from posting on his blog, and the man bun bartender guy had more attitude than RuPaul during fashion week.  Every request at tasting this line of unknown brews was greeted with an eye roll and a sigh.   Piss off, Snark Man.  Warehouse vide of the place feels like it should be cool, but I found it more cold and cafeteria-like, and on top of everything else, someone kept raising and lowering the light levels like an ADD kid who'd forgotten to take his Ritalin.  Maybe just a bad night?  Possibly.  But I'd suggest skipping this place.",

I thought the whole concept of the place was fascinating and such a great way for new places to make the transition to being a full restaurant. This is a perfect place to grab a drink after work and a meal if you're hungry. You order at the station and then pick any seat in the open area.   I chose the Bahn mi from Provisions with a side salad. The portion was HUGE- easily could have fed 2 people. So you are definitely getting bang for buck there. I will say I wish I would've gone with the fires instead of the salad. I felt like the dressing was lacking something. The bread on the Bahn mi was perfect.  Overall, Federal Galley is a must try!",

I've come for a friends birthday and for my own graduation dinner and it was just right - we got to bring gifts and our own desserts. It's all seat yourself with long tables that can definitely fit your whole party. The place is huge and very modern/trendy with a tall ceiling, outdoor patio, and Edison bulbs everywhere! The bar is rather small and has a specific menu, but there's still something for everyone!  Then comes the food. There are four restaurants that change periodically (not sure the timeline but it's pretty lengthy) and they get to set up in the galley free of rent. (Support small business - woohoo!) My personal favorite is the Michigan and Trumbull - it's Detroit style deep dish pizza that is to die for. Guapo has amazing food, as well! Portion sizes are honestly pretty big from each place so my little tip is to have everyone in your group get something different and everyone eat a lil bit of everything! I'm already dreaming of when I can go again.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Smallman Galley. So when Federal Galley opened, I was beyond excited to have a similar food hall opening within walking distance of my house. And with an awesome happy hour, a plethora of dining options, and a dog friendly patio, what more could you want?   Well, after a year and a half of visits that have become more infrequent, I can say that what I had hoped would be a neighborhood gem, well, isn't.   Their Happy Hour just ISN'T HAPPY. At least not when Joe the bearded bartender is there. He's unpleasant, to say the least. After a recent \"who wants to happy hour\" convo with friends, I've discovered that my husband and I are not the only ones turned off by how unfriendly he is. He refuses to engage in even the briefest conversation. He's short with patrons, and I've had experiences where he is just plain rude. I understand that they are busy, but with specialty cocktails and a large beer list, he should consider sharing some knowledge with the patrons instead of blowing them off with a self-serving \"I don't know, I quit drinking years ago\".   I'll continue suggesting happy hour at the Modern Cafe, where there are half priced beers, plus the bartenders are friendly, fast, and overall awesome.  Or...maybe FG could post the days Joe is off so people can enjoy a truly happy Happy Hour.  On a positive note. The rest of the bar staff is great. And the food options are great. Which Came First? is an awesome new addition, and while I will really miss Michigan & Trumble, I'm looking forward to trying the new Mexican spot.   Argh, why does one bad apple have to spoil this otherwise perfect bushel?",

Granted, it was a little chaotic when I arrived at 6 p.m. on a Friday night while the Pittsburgh Pirates were also in town for a 7 p.m. game.  But once the crowd thinned out a bit around 7 p.m., it wasn't as loud.    The atmosphere is pretty chill, and the food options are diverse and delicious. I opted for pizza from the Michigan & Trumbull. It was so good! The drink line was pretty long since happy hour ended at 6:30 p.m. I never made it to the bar.    I can't wait to go back to this place so I can try more of the food.  Portions were huge, prices were fair for the city, and the atmosphere was amazing on this beautiful Friday evening. Fresh air blowing through the restaurant since the doors were open. Lots of groups of people and conversation.  There were about 10 in our group, though, which made it tough to sit in a place where we could all see and hear each other. Tables are long; but this is no different than any other restaurant.   I left in such a good mood after visiting this place. Such a convenient location too!  Check this place out!",

I haven't met a drink I didn't like. I still haven't tried the first place in the lineup, El Lugar, but I've tried pizza and a coney dog from Michigan and Trumbull. The Woodward White is excellent! The coney dog was sooooo good especially for only $2! And I've tried two desserts from Supper. The Cheesecakes were both delicious however a bit more saltier than I was expecting. The atmosphere here is open and free with small and large tables in addition to lounge seating. This place is good for a first date, friends night out or company happy hour.",

    "text": "Overall, I will speak about the atmosphere at federal galley with high regard, but there are a few things you need to know to navigate this one successfully. On the positive side, the venue and outdoor space are very dog friendly and the few patrons who brought dogs were incredible respectful and caring. The outdoor patio is spacious and well laid out - a necessity for how busy the space gets! Unfortunately, the inside space where the larger brew menu and food options are gets packed and the lines and seating area indoors overlap inconveniently. The layout isn't ideal and the lack of bartenders (or urgency among those they do have) doesn't lend itself well to enjoying time with your friends while you wait in amusement park length lines to place your orders. Be warned that - while the outdoor bar and shorter line is enticing - it has a shorter line for a reason! The cocktail and beer list is limited, and you'll still wait a while only to get what seems like a miniature sized drink. Remember this when placing your order and consider ordering a few so you can spend your time as it's meant to be spent: with your friends.",

    "text": "The concept for Federal Gallery is fantastic, and my review exalts this idea.  For a two hour hit, I couldn't sample every restaurant, but I could certainly see myself spending hours here, drinking and tasting.  Basically, a bunch of good chefs opened up \"stalls\" in a refurbished hall.  Patrons saunter up to the \"stall,\" order, pay, and grab a table somewhere in the large space.  Or, if you're a lush like myself, you grab a seat at the centrally located two-sided bar.  When your food is ready, someone from the \"stall\" brings you your vittles.  I chose pizza.  It was very good.  Bartenders were great, informative and friendly.    I loved the concept, but found a few pitfalls.  The space is cold and innocuous, echoing a suburban mall.  The food deserves a space that concerns itself with aesthetics and some sense of design.  I felt I was dining in Penn Station below Madison Square Garden.  Also, signage on the outside is akin to what I would see at an amusement park.  I realize we are near the Children's museum and the street is called Children's Way, but Federal Gallery is for grown ups.  If Federal Gallery has a tacky affect, it will have a tacky essence.  Again, the quality of the cooking deserves more.   Yet, I had a great time and enjoyed the food and drink.  Time will tell if the idea catches on.",

Upon arriving, we parked in the Nova Place parking garage and took the elevator to the Plaza level...once out of the elevator turn left and the restaurant is right there!  There is a great outdoor space and pets are allowed in the patio area...unfortunately with the rain we spent our time inside. The space is huge and provided lots of room for groups. It was also a very family friendly environment...we were both impressed!  We grabbed food at Michigan & Trumbull and Supper and were not disappointed! We shared a pepperoni pizza (amazing), poutine fries (omg you have to get these!!), and the chocolate mousse cake! This was more than enough food to share and we left stuffed!   For those who have not been to one of these restaurants before....you order at the restaurant window and receive a table number...when the food is ready they bring it over! Despite being busy, our food came out quickly and everyone was very friendly!  In addition to our food we got a few beers at the bar. They have a great selection with 25+ beers on tap as well as mixed drinks. There were also plenty of TVs to watch the game!  Overall we really enjoyed our experience and will be back for more! For those going in a group this is a great place to try a few things and share!",

My daughter and I split a pizza. I've lived close to Detroit and it is an excellent representation of the style. My mom had a salad and taco and also was a fan.

    "text": "I've followed the Galley group from the beginning. Smallman was such an exciting concept, I was pumped to see Federal opening up in the North Side. Even more exciting, was that Provision was joining them, a former Smallman Galley fave (best burger in Pittsburgh maybe!).  I like this venue better than Smallman because it definitely feels more spacious, although I hear it's the same size, just different dimensions. The bar is nice and accessible though! I think their bar program might be one of the most interesting in the city, they always go with a fun seasonal cocktail theme and have a phenomenal local beer list.   I wanted to wait to write a review until I ate at each of the restaurants to do a fair assessment. There are four kinds. First I had El Lugar, which is delicious Mexican. I've had a nacho dish and pork enchiladas, which are a hearty helping, I might add. Supper is a great modern American concept that offers a variety of indulgent and healthy foods. I like that they have a lot of gluten free options for me.  The heirloom spinach and veggies is listed as a snack, but it's a hearty helping too, and could totally be a full dish. The strawberry vinaigrette put it over the edge of tastiness. But I had to even it out with the delicious poutine (also GF!). The fries were crispy, which is good when paired with gravy.   Finally, I'm so happy to report Michigan and Trumball has gluten free pizza. I was so sad to not be able to eat anything from there that when they started offering, I was first in line! That crispy cheesy crust is no joke. You could offer me a side of that and I'd be good. But the pizza itself is great. I had to double check it was GF because it tasted like normal delicious thick pizza crust. I just tried the spicy sausage pizza with pickled onions and that had to be some of the best toppings I've had on pizza.   I will note, parking can be difficult depending on the time of day. During workday hours, I usually just try to find parking on street. The NOVA place garage can be dicey. After hours you should be fine with the garage, but it's confusing to navigate how to get to Federal Galley from the inside. Other than that, I can't wait to sit outside in their newly opened patio during the warmer months, it is going to be killer!",

I had pizza which was not bad but nothing beyond basic pizza.  I was there on a Friday night which was very busy and the place gets loud making it difficult to have a pleasant social experience. The beer options were pretty good tho with really reasonable prices at the happy hour time.  Definitely a place to consider if you are around there but with an A-/B+ level expectations, at least at busy popular times.",

I tend to like this space a bit more due to more seating, and seemingly bigger menus from each restaurant, I'm assuming due to bigger kitchen spaces. They also have a great Happy Hour! Half off their cocktail list and draft beers I believe (It's good, trust me) It's perfect for any type of group since there are so many options for food/drinks/desserts. Everyone will find something they like. My pro tip would be to get a pizza and add the hot honey drizzle. So good. Also the brownie sundae with the chips on top from the taco place, amazing.",

I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pizzas, my personal fave though is the Packard Pepperoni. The fries are delicious too, the dipping sauce, ah so good. I will definitely be going back and need to try some other places but will probably still get a pizza on the side regardless :)",

It has the same concept of Smallman Galley, where the customer can choose items from different rotating kitchens and eat in a common area (*read as hipster food court, not in a mall)*. The bar is really neat too in that it fitted into the building's old vault, which is fairly noticeable when looking at the padlock door and bulky metal framework around the bar area. Overall, it's a really cool place to visit with a group of people as there is something for everyone!",

As someone who works in the Northside I'm thrilled to welcome the galley and even more thrilled that they offer lunch hours. Supper had a well rendered sea bass with Brussels and baked grapes. The side of mashed cauliflower was over spiced and could have been better described as cauliflower two ways as most of it was chopped. Additionally I have tried pizza from Trumbulls and was impressed with the inventive pairings like potato and horseradish that is lavished on chewy thick crust. In ambiance, the acoustics are a bit loud so if visiting during high traffic hours be prepared for lots of auditory stimulation... All in all, I am glad to welcome this crew to the nor' side!!",

Federal Galley is a great space, with plenty of open space and seating indoors, and outdoor seating in both the back and front of the building. The floor to ceiling windows/doors that open make this place always feel bright and happy. The food options are solid (I won't go into too many details in this general review). It seems that the owners do a nice job of rotating interesting and unique restaurant concepts through so there are options for every tastebud that walks in.   My favorite part of Federal Galley? Half price happy hour. What better way to end the workday (or workweek) with a half-priced glass of wine (or cocktail or local craft beer). I have been hard-pressed to find a happy hour in Pittsburgh that I enjoy as much as this one. I also appreciate the live music on the weekend and the many cool different events that are hosted here. Thanks, Federal Galley, for being a beloved staple of the northside!",

I love that there are so many different options. There's truly something for everyone, which is great when you can't agree on what you're in the mood for for dinner!   We ordered from Which Came First (grilled chicken salad) and Shaka (spicy salmon poke bowl). We enjoyed both options, and they were delivered to our table very quickly after ordering. They also offer a great happy hour of 1/2 off all beer, wine, and cocktails from 4:30-6:30 PM. There were only a few options of wine, but an extensive list of different beers on tap, as well as specialty cocktails. The only thing I didn't love at the bar area is there were a bunch of tiny flies; that's definitely not a deal breaker, as the food and drinks were delicious, but just something we noticed that wasn't great.",

    "text": "Smallman Galley is one of my favorite places in PGH, so I have been itching to try Federal Galley for quite some time now! Love the concept, allowing different chefs to have their time to shine at the restaurant - a great way to get new chefs off and running!  The North Shore location is a lot bigger than the Strip District one and tons of outdoor seating, so much better to go to with groups especially in the summer time. Warning that the location is a little hidden - it's in an almost business park-like area, so have to search a little bit for it.   We went for brunch on a Sunday, and surprisingly it wasn't overly crowded. When first looking at the restaurants' brunch menus, I honestly wasn't overly excited - a lot of it was standard fare brunch options. There was also an underwhelming number of \"sweet\" choices, which is usually my go-to for brunch. Regardless, we both decided to go for Which Came First, a southern-inspired, home-cooking restaurant which had the most exciting choices to us. My BF and I actually swapped preferences - he went \"sweet\" with the \"State Fair\" and I \"savory\" with the \"Georgia Benedict.\" The State Fair was v unique, with funnel cake fries topped with a berry compote and fried chicken. The chicken had a sweet tinge to it that complimented the flavors of the fries nicely - my BF said this was one of the best breakfast chickens he's had! The Benedict was a unique take on a classic dish, featuring fried green tomatoes instead of English muffin and rosemary ham. The flavors of the ham brought out the flavors of the hollandaise, bringing the dish together. I enjoyed it - not the best Benedict I've had, but tasty. Important to note is that the restaurants themselves do not serve coffee, so was a little confused on how to order. I guessed right that the bar had some - however, it's not listed anywhere, so that's a little confusing. And when I received our coffees, there were not any \"sleeves\" on them, so it was super difficult to carry them without burning my hands. Lastly, I walked around the restaurant twice to try to find the cream/sugar - finally found it, but that also was secret and only offered the individual creamer packets and sugar-in-the-raw. For such a trendy place, I was expecting a little more robust of a coffee selection, so this was a little disappointing. However, we still enjoyed our overall meal despite!  Overall, we had a lovely brunch at Federal Galley, especially sitting out on the patio on a beautiful day. Definitely recommend up-ing the coffee game for the future to please brunchers. Would love to try for HH or dinner so I can experience other restaurants (while they're still there!)",

I paired it with a local beer by Cinderstown brewery. The rest of our party of four raved about their food, and it's great to have options when traveling with a group.

The pork banh mi sandwich had a very odd taste, something about the oil on the pork just seemed off. I thought the loaded fries was a unique idea but the flavors just didn't really come together for me. The Mac and cheese though was very good though! I don't usually get this dish but saw another table's plate and had to order it. My friend said it was one of the best Mac and cheese dishes he's ever had! Otherwise, overall meh experience",

The outside seating area/bar had such good vibes, and the whole set-up reminded me of something I'd see back home in California.  As for food, I enjoyed the heck out of 'the burger' with fries from Provision. The burger was perfectly medium rare (as requested) with nice sauteed mushrooms, aioli (if a little too much of it), and a fresh sesame bun. The fries were well-seasoned, crisp, and came with a little aioli dip of their own. I also snagged a Brooklyn sour from the outside bar, which was v nice.  Would definitely come back with good company in good weather!",

Who doesn't love trying new restaurants?! I've never eaten anything bad at any of the 4 restaurants within Federal Galley.  All the restaurants are on top of their game. The food is always delicious, full of flavor, unique items and the food presentation is always on point.  Federal Galley does get very crowded at peak times so it may be a little hard to find a place to sit. But if you plan ahead and go a little earlier or little later you'll be ok.  Keep up the great work Federal Galley!!",

    "text": "Still a super solid place for group meals! We went a couple days ago and tried the two newest restaurant concepts. Which Came First has delicious onion rings and their chicken looks phenomenal. My boyfriend and I both loved Guapo, the Mexican concept. I had the braised beef guacamole tacos and he had the shredded chicken quesadilla. At $15 a piece the entrees seemed a little pricey for Mexican food, but given the freshness, flavor, and generous portions it's well worth it. Both entrees came with home fries and beans, so he left super full and satisfied and I was able to eat a third of mine for lunch the next day.   Iron Born and Provision are still going strong as well. Provision made my mother seared rare tuna and chips in lieu of fish and chips due to her gluten allergy, and the Iron Born pizzas were a hit with our whole table. If you somehow haven't made it out to Federal Galley yet, I strongly suggest going. It never fails to be a crowd pleaser!",

I knows there's always a big debate between federal and Smallman and I always find myself picking federal over Smallman because it's bigger and there's so much more space. (I do like Smallman too though!)   Provision- The crispy cauliflower is soo good! I would definitely go back and get that again. It was hands down the best thing I had here. We also had the asparagus was just ok. My mom also had the pork belly and she raved about it!   El Lugar- I got the taco plate with the side salad. The side salad was fresh and light. I got the chicken taco, shredded beef taco and the fish taco. The taco's were good, however, I thought the chicken taco was a little bland. I've also had the chopped salad which was go good!   Which came first- I got a wrap with grilled chicken Nashville style. It was so good. I'd go back and try more from their menu! My sister got the Nutella French toast and enjoyed it!",

    "text": "Interesting concept but poor execution and way overpriced. When you enter, it's confusing and not clear how the place works. A simple sign would have been very helpful. We started with Provisions for burgers and fries for the kids, but the burgers were almost raw and they don't have ketchup for the fries. The pancakes were thin and dried out. Portions were good and the fries were OK, but you only get tiny little ends for some reason. They also charged us for coke instead of water (we didn't know there was water on the tables because of the confusing system they have) and when we asked to fix it, they couldn't. The employees didn't know how to work the register, so we got stuck paying more for their mistake.   We then got a burrito from the next place and it was both huge and very tasty. I'd stick to the TexMex option if you visit. The final meal was from the Chicken place and for $15 I was expecting something better than the dry, over cooked, mess that I received. The onion rings were as close to tempura as Pluto is to Earth. We got a Pho to go and it was certainly hot and looked good, if pricy.   I am fine with overpriced trendy restaurants, provided that the food is great. With a few exceptions, the food here is mediocre and priced about 50% more than its worth. It took a long time to get the food as well, and the place was empty. I can't imagine what it's like in a busy might. Luckily, the bar was well stocked and beer was reasonable, $3.50 for a draft is about the going rate.",

Dog-friendly (yesssss), and boasting a wide variety of craft beer and cocktails at half price for happy hour 4:30-6:30, in addition to the up and coming restaurants in the area, Federal Galley has what you need.   5/5 for ambiance. Bravo.   The restaurant we went to was called \"What Came First\" which specializes in you guessed it, chicken.  The General - 3.9/5 A little messy and confused in its identity, it's a cross between a gourmet chicken sandwich and a Chinese takeout experiment gone awry. Entirely too much sauce with a less than desirable amount of the other interesting toppings mount a giant chicken breast. For $13 (no sides included) it wasn't the best.   The Gabagool - 4.3/5 This one was better. Same chicken breast but with a slab of fresh mozzarella, marinara sauce, and Italian meats, this sandwich was more manageable and tasty.   Mac n Cheese - 3.2/5 Does every restaurant slather cheese sauce over *specifically* cavatappi pasta noodles now, toss a higher price on it m and call it a day? I'm getting sick of it. The noodles were clearly from a box and the sauce was gritty.   Value 4.4/5 Come at 4:30 for the great happy hour and unique food options. I think they have music at 7 Thursday-Saturday as well.

The only downside was parking and that was because we didn't know where it actually was. But the garage is close so that was very minor. The pizza was amazing and definitely Detroit style. The atmosphere is very similar to Smallman Galley but I like This one more. We ordered the Farnsworth Funghi, St. Auburn sausage and the waffle fries. The dough was very crispy on the outside but perfect in the middle, the fries were done just right with some delicious seasonings. The ranch was excellent as well that came with the fries. The bar was cool in the middle but the service was less then impressive. The bartender was rude and not helpful. By luckily that won't stop us from going back! Can't wait to try the other chefs creations!",

    "text": "The Pittsburgh food universe is a divided set...some love Smallman more...others Federal. I get it...it's a tough call. Me? I have to say, I love Smallman more than Federal and prefer the intimate setting. I can't help it and love how cozy it is! However, they are very different spaces and that is not to say that anything is bad about Federal Galley. My boyfriend loves the open atmosphere and the higher chance of finding a seat with a group of people. I've been there a couple of times but really have only eaten at Michigan and Trumbull and Provision. I don't feel like I need to dote on the pizza, I am sure 99% of these reviews gush over it. The Provision burger though...oh my. Smoked mushrooms and umami mayo, yes please. I really do want to try Supper and El Lugar and really have no excuse for having not. Everything that comes from Supper looks amazingly beautiful. My friend ordered their eggs benedict that uses fried eggplant as the base. It looked insanely pretty and he really enjoyed it.  Overall, it is a great option for food, a wonderful addition to the North Side and a wonderful place for friends to gather.",

Didn't even make it to the bar because the crowd was so dense around it and not moving. That kinda sucked.  The food was good. A little expensive for the portions but still good.  Will try again but definitely not worth all the hype...",

I was told prior that the food was \"all right\" \"okay\" and \"not bad\" but I was starving and prepared to revel in its deliciousness. Turns out, however, that these descriptors are very accurate, which made me a little sad because everything else speaks of hip gourmet (including the prices - $14 burrito much?). They were so darn close! Just add some more spices to your chicken, some onion, chillies, give your pintos more flavor than a whisper of tomato, and don't expect guac to do the heavy lifting! The food felt like if somebody cared just about 40% more, there'd be nothing to disappoint.",

Only reason I give this 4 stars is because it is tricky to find parking and also it was hard to find where I could buy a cup of coffee..

    "text": "We're big fans of Smallman Galley and we were excited about checking out the North Shore space for Federal Galley. The space itself definitely met our expectations--it was bright, with lots of windows, and a great bar with service on both sides. Lots of tables, including some larger communal table seating similar to Smallman. The place is open and bright with an industrial feel.  We visited Federal Galley on two occasions--once for dinner and once for Sunday brunch.  Our drinks were great. Wonderful beer list and cocktail options, and we enjoyed everything we had from the bar. The one exception is that, during a breakfast trip, the coffee was really disappointing...basically coffee from a big container served in a paper cup, nothing like the amazing coffee they serve at the Smallman Galley location.  We had items from all four restaurants during our two visits.  The pizza at Michigan and Trumbull was probably a highlight in terms of food. The Detroit-style pizza, with a thick and slightly crisp crust, with the St. Aubin toppings (broccoli, sausage, creme-fraiche, and cheese) was excellent.   El Lugar was more disappointing. Their tacos were not particularly exciting and lacked that great balance between the freshness of toppings and fatty/salty meat that we look for in tacos.   We'd all had Provision before, when they used to be at the Smallman location. Their best bets remain their burger and their crispy chicken sandwich, which are consistently excellent. Their specials, entrees, and brunch items are sometimes a little more inconsistent.   Supper was also a little disappointing. During breakfast, they ran out of biscuits or something, so they just brought out the dish with toast instead, but it would have been nice to know that before purchasing. Eggs lacked any seasoning at all and were underdone. Their poutine was good, but their hangar steak dish was, again, underseasoned and weirdly balanced.   Staff were super friendly and helpful--always scouting tables to see if water carafes need replaced or dishes need cleared.",

Mom left her wallet at home, which led to a stupid game of drink-passing. Next time I'll make sure my retiree parents have proof of age, though there won't be a next time soon.

My hubby tried their burger and fries. He never makes a big deal about food and wouldn't stop talking about the fries being the most amazing he ever had. I had to agree!! His burger was also very, very good!! The meat crumbled in your mouth which is my favorite kind of burger!   I also knew I couldn't leave without trying the very Instagrammed MICHIGAN&TRUMBULL. I went with their FARNSWORTH FUNGHI because every single thing on it holds a special place in my food heart. It did not disappoint. It was the perfect pizza. Gooey, salty, crunchy, amazing. It's going to be hard going back and not getting all of the above again!!   Oh and the beer during happy hour is so cheap!! The one I got was only $3!! $3 for Southern Tier is unheard of!!",

The space is really open and has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  There are about 25 beers on tap (menu from around the Burgh!!).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the location.  It is kind of tucked away in the North Shore by the Children's Museum away from most other popular locations.",

She went out of her way to address my question and was extremely nice. I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "First off, I love the concept of multiple restaurants with limited menus all under the same roof with communal seating.  Reminds me of Time Out in Lisbon, Portugal.  The space is nice on the inside with decent layout.  Its great to have the outdoor space, but that could use some investment to really make it a nice area beyond just some tables with umbrellas.    Food was ok.  Had the Pork Belly BLT with fries cooked in duck fat from Supper.  It was good, but nothing I would crave or immediately say \"I will be back for that again\".  Price points seem to be on the mark for the value in my opinion, so that is good.  Decent beer selection, though midway through Happy Hour they had already removed four or five selections from the board because they were kicked (luckily not the two selections I had been enjoying).  The line to get drinks was fairly substantial and took at least 10 mins to get a beer, so more staffing during busy times is a must.  Would go back if others wanted to go and would try other food concepts.  As I said, I love the core concept of Federal Gallery but some fairly minor operational and style tweaks would go a long way.",

The food was yum.. although we ordered way too many fries. We tried the burger at provision. The burger was cooked exactly the way I asked for and it was delicious. Their fries were perfect. We also tried the poutine at supper which was great, it had a brisket gravy with little chunks of beef in it which made it pretty much a meal! We also tried the falafel at supper which i enjoyed but my husband thought was a little bland. The only disappointment for me was the dessert at supper. We got the warm persimmon pudding, which tasted more like warmed up baby food. It did not look appetizing and tasted sort of what it looked like. One of our friends got the grilled cheese at supper and thought it was ok. She said she has had better, she did however love the chickpea fries it came with. We would definitely go back - and definitely order fewer fries next time!",

I am all about this \"fancy cafeteria\": same delicious lentil fries from Provision that I loved at Smallman so much, yummy tacos from El Lugar, that crispy delicious hot honey and pepperoni pizza from Michigan & Trumbull, and any of the veg-centric dishes from Supper all make it a stand out option for a wide range of palates.    The bar is located in the old bank vault and has a ton of draft options.  Shout out to the boss ass bar staff, which is always super friendly and helpful even when the place is slammed!  They do great happy hour specials, and I can tell a lot of other folks from the neighborhood or who work near by are taking advantage of the spacious, airy atmosphere with communal tables.

I am going to be realistic and say maybe trying a couple of things from each menu isn't a great way to fully judge a place, however these items were so disappointing that I'm going to go ahead and do it.    Lugar- I had the Pork Pibil taco and if you love the taste of dry, day old pork this is the taco for you. For $3.50 you get a $2 Size taco with bland, day old pork that clearly is just reheated in a pan real quick. A place that specializes in tacos should at least do that well.   Supper- I had the Poutine which is really hard to mess up. It's brown pan gravy doused fries with fresh cheese curds. Yet, somehow it was. A pot roast mix was poured over fries and what seemed to be sliced mozzarella sticks. Maybe I am being picky but I had a few drinks and this still didn't satisfy my Poutine graving, I mean craving.   Atmosphere is what you're paying for here, if you miss your school cafeteria you'll be feeling nostalgic all night.",

It was quite busy when we went, though I was told it is always that way. Luckily, we were able to find seats without much issue.   I ordered a taco plate with veggie and stewed potato tacos. Both was pretty good. I shared the beans and salad with my brother who also go the taco plate. The salad was a little salty. The beans were standard. Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their meals.   I suggest trying the bloody mary if you like them. This one was the perfect amount of horseradish with not a huge amount of tomato juice. Quite delicious.   I love that they provide water to everyone. Every time a water jug was emptied, another would appear at the table. It was like magic.

    "text": "After visiting Smallman Galley and having a pleasant experience there, my manager and I decided to go to Federal Galley for lunch.  (We knew that we had to work on the Northside offsite for a day and that the restaurant incubator site was extremely close by, so we decided to explore.) This food hall is expansive and intimate all at the same time. (I don't know how the designers pulled that off...)   \"Industrial Chic\" can sometimes seem off-putting and impersonal, but Federal Galley has a charming vibe to it.  I'm notorious amongst my family and friends for taking years to order at a restaurant, but I actually studied all of the incubator restaurant menus before I got there. (Plus, I was limited to an hour, so I didn't have time to pussy-foot around.)   My manager decided to go with the \"Fish Sammy\" (Seared Yellowfin Tuna with Remoulade, Greens, B&B Pickled Onions, Potato Bun - $14.00) at \"Provision Pgh\" and I decided to go with the \"BLT\" (Confit pork belly, tomato, romaine heart, black garlic aioli, bacon jam, sourdough - $13) and Duck Fat Fries with rosemary salt, parmesan and Harissa ketchup from \"Supper\".  Both of were pleased with our choices.  My confit pork belly sandwich wasn't overly greasy and the fat was rendered out nicely and my potatoes were de-lish-us!  My manager was also quite pleased with her food and said that she would come back again. (That's our restaurant stamp of approval. \"Would you come back here again?\"  If the answer is \"No\", then that restaurant is a no-go!)  The prices here are a little steep (None of the restaurants really had a sandwich under $10 and the side dishes and snacks weren't too far behind.) but it's a good treat restaurant for the budget challenged and a good go-to if you have more lee-way with your budget.  You, the customer, get a chance to see how a budding restaurant tweaks their menus and you can see how they develop (hopefully) over time.  The restaurateur gets a chance to try out their menu and concepts without spending goo gobs of money.  It's a win-win situation for everyone.  Like I said, I will definitely be back.",

I had the Pork Pibil and the Shrimp with kimchi. I have to say, I wasn't really a fan of either. Both tacos were dry and the pork could have used jalapenos or something. I will give the other concepts a try! Looking forward to Michigan and Trumbull next time...  I did have the most amazing winter old fashioned, however. It had a banana-y taste but very mild, not fruity or anything. Will be going back for a few more of those! Other than that, the ambiance is great and it's so much more spacious than Smallman.

Take a walk around and see all the options then go back to what caught your eye. There are SO many seating options, walk around, you will for sure find somewhere. We came during the dinner rush on Saturday night and still found quite the perfect spot to sit and eat. The nice man even turned on the Pens game for us! You do need to go to the bar and get your own drinks, but there's water on all the tables. There are seriously so many drink options, you will be happy!  We decided to go with the pizza, Michigan & Trumbull. We shared the arugula salad first... It was crispy and refreshing, a little tangy dressing, but nicely balanced. I had the vegan pizza, it was so yummy. The crust is soft with a nice crunch too! It had roasted eggplant, super delicious. The pizza had a nice spice to it, I'm not sure if it was the walnut puree drizzle or the red pepper flakes. I did ask for pickled onion in addition, and it came without, kinda sad, but still scrumptious. Either way, yes yes yes, I want it again! The cilantro finish was a nice addition, but maybe just a little too much cilantro for my taste. My husband had the chorizo pie, he also loved it! He opted out of the pickled red onions on it, but to me it sounds like it would have paired perfectly. The pizza had a nice little ranch drizzle, he had no complaints!  The pizza did take about 45-50 minutes, but it was totally worth the wait. Everyone is SO incredibly friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again!",

    "text": "I popped in here on one of the rare times i was in the north side.  The space: feels so open and inviting. Much more so than Smallman Galley (even though I LOVE that place). I know they're supposedly all the same square footage but this lay out feels more open concept to me. I went on a rather gloomy day so the outside wasn't really opened or if it was it was too wet for me to be interested in it. The Bar: they really do the best seasonal and themed cocktail menu in the city, IMO. They bartender was friendly and quick with suggestions and assistance.  El Lugar: Firs tthe name is great!! (The Place) I am a sucker for anything mexican or mexica inspired. Tacos are my life. I had the beef taco and the pork taco and they were both incredible and flavorful. Definitely a good size, and comparable to all those other \"fancier taco\" joints you may have visited. Their guac and chips was a hearty portion and great snack/appetizer. Provision: An oldie but goodie! They used to be in the smallman space and we just loved them. HUGE fan of the crispy cauliflower and the bread and butter (seriously! BREAD AND BUTTER IS THE BEST). Their bahn mi is good, but no where near the best i've had. They have pretty solid burgers and they do a burger of the moment which was awesome. Michigan & Trumball: They have a gluten free pizza that my friend was just DYING about. I thought it was solid but expensive. It's definitively a \"treat yo self\" type of pizza. It's not an everyday pizza. But that's okay. Supper: i did not get to try yet but am really looking forward to it!!! Parkin: it's a shit show. Let's be honest. It's never easy to find anywhere to park out there, if you find a good spot... sit tight.",

I asked the bartender to make me a \"fake\" mixed drink as I was pregnant and no one knew, I didn't even have to finish my sentence and he whipped a beautiful looking thing up and said \"on the house - congrats\" that right there will make me come back.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of this concept and this space is absolutely beautiful, but I will ding it a few stars for the bartenders. I shouldn't have to ask for my check 3 times, especially on a night where you aren't overly busy. Nor should you be so short with guests when you're asking for their ID's.   We had two bartenders, and maybe it was an off night, but we didn't enjoy it as much as our trips to Smallman. The drinks were however reasonably priced, especially the beer that was on special for the Founder's Brewery event. And the food is on point, so we'll definitely be back, we just may avoid the cocktails on our next trip.",

    "text": "I finally got to visit Federal Galley.  After visiting Smallman a few times - I have been anxiously trying to get to Federal Galley since it opened.    I Love love love the concept restaurants.  It's fantastic.  You can find food for everyone.    We were able to try food from 3 of the 4 concept restaurants - Michigan & Thumbull, Provision, and Supper, while of course getting some tasty beverages.  The Fungi Pizza from Michigan & Thumbull was SO so good.  I did take off a bit of the arugula on top - but it was still phenomenal.  The pork belly w/Kimchi from Provision was my favorite dish.  The kimchi had more of a bbq flavor than spice - but was so so so good.  The food at Supper was good - but my friend and i both felt it needed something else.  My bite of meat in the poutine was all fat.  Kind of disappointing.  Anyways - I have a feeling this will turn into a frequent stop.  It's so easy to try and so so good.",
