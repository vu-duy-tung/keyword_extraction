    "text": "So far, I think this is probably one of the better Chinese restaurant that delivers to us. They offer both American Chinese, authentic Chinese and sushi. We got geo chicken and shredded pork in garlic sauce. The geo chicken tasted really good but it could be more crispier, part of it I think is because it was delivery. The shredded pork was 6.5/10 authentic. It was not like some other place claim they have the authentic Szechuan dish but it was really not. This one it has most of the ingredients that the dish would have if it is in China. It tasted a little bit too salty. There are defiantly some improvements can be done but I'm pretty happy with the order. Look order again to try some other dishes they have. One more tip for ordering, make sure mention that you want the meal cooked in authentic Chinese style or American style. I think there are some dishes that can be cooked in both ways.",

Our waiter also went the extra mile whenever he served us, for example, by bringing out extra plates for sharing when we only asked for bowls.  The restaurant is spacious and layout is well thought out. Because there is so much space, the tables are placed quite far apart from each other which allowed us a quiet and comfortable meal in our own spot. This in itself was a big part of our enjoyable experience here tonight.  We ordered a pot of chinese tea and 2 szechuan dishes. The pot of chinese tea definitely added to the authenticity of dining here.  1) Flaming chicken wings on hot dish Served on a small flame that kept it warm throughout, portions were generous with mushrooms, cauliflower and celery.  2) Braised pork intestine noodle soup We really enjoyed everything about this dish - noodles, soup and intestines. The intestines were the big ones. The soup had just the right amount of spice and flavouring without drowning each other out. The noodles were similar like udon / lo mien style noodles.  Dinner for 2 people came came out to $27.00, fairly cheap for such a decent meal. We will definitely be coming back.",

We ordered the beef tendon appetizer, double cooked sliced pork belly and the fish fillet in spicy broth. The food arrived timely and portions were generous and tasted as you would expect from a Sichuan restaurant. The fish however stole the show since I could tell the fish were freshly filleted as opposed to the commercial fillets a lot of other places use. If I had to make one critique, it's not as spicy as many Sichuan places which didn't bother me since I like food spicy or mild. If you're looking for a kick though you might need to ask them to make it spicier.",

Aside from the fact that our server was new and hardly knew the menu, our overall experience was average.  We couldn't figure out how to order what the other tables had (hopelessly American we are) and our server was not of help.  We had an amazing appetizer of cold noodles with a spicy sauce, but our main dishes were only meh.  The taste was nothing special.  I might give this place another shot, and hopefully get a more knowledgable server.  As of now, I *much* prefer Chengdu or Sichuan House.",

The eggplant had a balance of sweet and spicy and the pork belly dish had abundant slices of pork belly and leeks.

The noodles are just perfectly thick and cooked, and flavors subtle but rich. Their General Tso's is amazing - spicy sweet thick sauce! The shrimp is my favorite. Also very fast service and delivery, and great value - lots of food for the money! Their menu is very extensive and I look forward to sampling both the traditional and authentic Sichuan dishes when I'm feeling more adventurous!",

Followed with a whole crispy fish that was off the charts great. We then had string beans. Followed by an extremely spicy dry chicken and pepper . So flavorful and yummy. Ended with Mooshoo Pork. A feast and the price was right all for under $80. Only complaint was tea was made with Lipton Green tea bags- they should serve authentic tea. Great food, great caring service and we dined on a large round table with a lazy Susan to spin the feast. The is in the former Jimmy Tsang on Center. One more quality Chinese restaurant - too many to choose.",

I also sampled my friends spicy beef noodle soup and it was amazing. Their lunch specials are a great value as well.

I was a fan of the pancakes bu the fried hot peppers were waaaaaay to hot for my American tongue. Only one of us were able to handle its spice but it was a cool experience. For my entree, I ordered the Chef's Special Szechuan Double Delight. The dish came out quickly and came with white rice. The flavor was delicious and it was a big portion. I probably could have shared it with someone else if I had eaten more rice. Additionally, I was able to take the rest home. The service overall was impeccable. We were given extra plates for sharing and water was refilled as needed. The mochi was also order for dessert and we were given a free scoop of ice cream since we had a hefty bill. They were also able to accommodate splitting the bill between us.",

    "text": "Is it just me or did it take forever for this place to finally get off the ground.  How many years was it that this place sat in a state of suspended readiness?  Finally, it opened it's doors and ran with it.  The good thing about working in Oakland means that you have a multitude of places to order your lunch from.  Working with people that seem to live off of Chinese food, you always have the best restaurants' menus available.    I was in the mood for some good vegetable chow down.  Looking over the 'Vegetables' section I honed in on a potato based plate.  I went with Sauteed Shredded Potatoes.  When you select this you have three choices of sauce: hot pepper, spicy sauce, or vinegar (not spicy).  Looking at that list, if you are like me, you would think that meant the the spice level was in descending order.  That would be why I went with spicy sauce.  My god, was I ever wrong, I should have went with vinegar.  I don't mind some good spicy food, but that's when I could enjoy it.  This had a spice to it that made me cry, and not with joy.  That's not to take away from the overall plate, it was a good taste and cooked amazingly.  It's just I was paying for this meal well into the morning, if you know what I mean.  I think at one point I even opened the fridge and pulled out some pesto to cool this down a bit.  Even though the spice level was burning my eyebrows off, I still went at this.  Sweat coming out of every pore, nose like a faucet and an uncomfortable feeling of what lay ahead.  Would I get this dish again, yes, but the vinegar sauce would be my answer to this.  Why not five stars?  The price.  Some of the prices were down right outrageous.  For the price here you could possibly get two meals elsewhere.",

The roll was delicious, so when the big plate of crispy chicken covered in peppers came, I was excited. Unfortunately, it was like chewing on a salt block. The crisp was perfect, the heat was great, but I could not get past the overwhelming salt. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be really salty and she said she never noticed. I had her take it because I truly couldn't eat it. She said she would tell the chef, but no one asked/apologized to me or offered me anything. (At the very least, since I barely ate, the meal should have come off my bill). Too bad, this place is up the street from the hotel I stay at every month, but I won't be back.",

Tonight, my taro bubble tea was missing from my delivered order. I called the driver, thinking it might be in his car, but it was not, and he told me he'd clear it up with the restaurant himself (wow!). No more than 10 minutes later, my phone rings, and it's the driver outside with my bubble tea, made exactly to my specifications. I didn't know it was possible to be impressed with delivery service, but these guys are wicked fast (tonight's dinner was delivered a mere 25 minutes after we ordered) and very courteous.  The food--a perfect compromise for my szechuan cravings and my husband's \"mall Chinese food\" cravings. I get their version of mabo dofu, he gets something fried in a sticky sauce, and we share a Chinese takeout staple: green beans with a generous topping of ground pork. Other favorites include their steamed dumplings and the chopped chicken. The only thing we haven't loved was the dan dan--a little too sesame-y for our tastes (almost tasted peanut-y). And I'll throw down some fighting words--I think their mabo dofu is better than Chengdu and Sichuan Gourmet's.  Super fast tasty food, and they actually read your comments about customizations...what more could you want in a delivery place?",

    "text": "One of the best Chinese dinners I have ever had in Pittsburgh. Everything about this place is spectacular- the decor inside, the food, and the ambience!   First, the food and drinks are just simply wonderful. I started my meal off on the sweet side with a mango bubble tea, and I must say, that was one of the best bubble teas ever. The bubble tea did not have a sickening sweet taste, it had rather a naturally sweet taste from the mango and coconut jelly in it. The liquid was not grainy and there were plenty of tapioca balls and coconut jelly pieces in the drink. Onto the food- delicious, marvelous, and authentic is how to sum things up. My family and I ordered a few appetizers such as scallion pancakes, sushi, and assorted dumplings. The scallion pancakes and sushi were great, but the dumplings hit the spot. They were so flavorful and fresh. For my main course, I had the pork blood tofu soup which came with fish fillet, pork intestine, and beef tripe. Don't knock it until you try it, you have to be adventurous! I loved this soup because the textures of the meats inside are fine with me and there were lots of hot peppers in the soup. Additionally, the portions here are huge. I had so much soup left over that it filled not just one, but two large containers!! To end on a sweet note as well, I had the red bean ice cream for dessert. It was super creamy and it tasted homemade.   If you are looking for authentic Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area, swing by Szechuan Spice because your tastebuds will be very happy!",

LUNCH SPECIAL ($7-$8): I have had the Shredded beef with hot pepper here, and thought it was kind of salty then I proceeded to pass out for 3 hours possibly from MSG?? Diced chicken Chengdu style is very good and has good spice, but the chicken pieces are a bit small. SUSHI LUNCH SPECIAL ($9-$12): 2 rolls for $9 with your choice of house salad or miso soup. Or a sashimi special! We always like to at least get the unagi maki :). BROILED FISH (~$19): Every Szechuan place I go to, I have to try this. Me and the boyfriend have tried their spicy broiled fish here several times, and they have made it with different veggies sometimes. I think it's best when served in the flat glass dish. PEA SHOOTS (~$10): Sometimes too oily, but always given a lot for your dollar.  A lot of people seem to get delivery or take out, but I would try giving them a visit for dine-in! It is very spacious in here and they recently got some cozy black booths instead of regular tables. I highly recommend Szechuan Spice if you're trying to find a Chinese restaurant for a big party too!",

I ended up getting two shrimp tempura rolls (shrimp tempura and avocado).  The chicken and string beans were ok; I've been here before for their Szechuan cuisine and I would say that their Szechuan food tastes better than their American-Chinese options. I've had their mapo tofu and diced chicken with fried peppers chongqing style and they were both 10/10.  The sushi was fresh and it tasted good. Good amount of food for the price. They have a lot of lunch specials and deals so it's nicer on the wallet.

I discovered this place from my girlfriend, who saw several ads and also frequently shops at Geagle and Aldi nearby. Needless to say we've been here several times and it's been solid every time. They have half off sushi on Wednesday, which I think tastes decently fresh (the unagi)  Typically we ordered the broiled fish as well as the pea shoots. Both are tasty and authentic - however the broiled fish sometimes has a bit too much mala numbing spice, making our lips very tingly and sometimes just a bit overwhelming, so we ask for less spice. The veggies are also a bit on the oilier side.   It's never been crowded and the place is very spacious, which I like since I never feel packed or disturbed by a lot of noise. Definitely give this place a shot if you are in the area!",

Ordered delivery and when the guy got here, he called, I told him to come around to the side of the house because that's where my entrance is. He just said \"I'm here\" hung up and delivered the food to my neighbors instead. Luckily I have honest neighbors.  Got the 2 sushi roll lunch special.  Shrimp tempura roll was 5/5. Insanely good. The cucumber and tobiko gave it a nice extra crunch and the avocado and crab were good additions. Sweet potato roll 2/5: I love sweet potato tempura rolls. But the tempura was completely soggy, the sweet potato was hard/not cooked or ripe, and the rice was dried out. Mapo tofu 3.5/5: This is kind of my fault because I didn't realize it came with soft tofu, but I thought the tofu made it really difficult to eat and was too slimy. The sauce was yummy but I would not order this again.  Honestly it only got 4/5 because the shrimp tempura roll was so good and it was a really good amount of food for the price. I would definitely try the sushi lunch special again but get another roll instead of sweet potato.",

    "text": "I finally was able to stop by and try Szechuan Spice, and after multiple years of living directly over it in the past, this was a long time coming.  If I can give you only one tip with this restaurant, it is this -- Go. On. Wednesday. There is a half price sushi menu and it is excellent. After a meal of 2 specialty sushi rolls, one spicy tuna roll, two pieces of salmon sushi, a pork egg roll, and dessert, the bill was $28. Not too shabby.  I ordered the spicy girl roll which was absolutely perfect. It was spicy, but just a bit, and that was cooled off by the avocado. I really enjoyed how the whole roll was wrapped with imitation crab on the outside; it had a surprising texture and added a sweet note. (yes, most sushi uses imitation crab, don't gasp, deep down you knew that and it is delicious so don't judge).   The salmon sushi was of very good quality; the two rolls ordered by my companion (the rainbow roll and spicy tuna) were also yummy. Very fresh overall! But the most interesting and one of the most surprising parts of the meal was the red bean ice cream. I've never had red bean ice cream before, and it was actually quite good. For some reason it reminded me of stracciatella due to the texture and flavor.  The service was friendly and quick for fresh sushi. I'll have to stop by another time to try all if the different items offered on the menu, but it'll be hard to tear me away from the Wednesday special.",

    "text": "This place has exceptionally poor service. The employees are really young and don't seem to care or have very much experience.  We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes just to get menus after being seated at the sushi bar.  We came in specifically for half-price Sushi Wednesday and they did not give us the menus with the Wednesday Sushi specials for another five minutes, and we had to ask a different staff member for that specific menu.  Then we ordered from the sushi chef directly and after being served sushi had to wait another 4 minutes for chopsticks. This is totally ridiculous as far as the order of service is concerned.  Their English is so poor that a simple request like, \"Please put the vegetable sushi on a separate plate from the fish sushi,\" is too hard for them to understand. To top it all off I was charged for the wrong sushi and asked to have the bill adjusted. She said it was too late because she had already charged my card, and she would give me the difference back in cash but without sales tax. She acted so annoyed that I would actually expect to get the sales tax back from the overcharge that I was given on my bill. So I was like, seriously? I just laid the sales tax on the desk and walked out.  On the up side, the sushi was good quality even though the pickled ginger was the cheap kind with artificial coloring and saccharin in it.",

The soup arrived extra hot even though the restaurant is like 20 mins from me! That was a huge plus. The sushi was very fresh but could have had a bit more rice. I don't like a ton of rice but a little more would have been good. The beef soup was really good.   Also they packaged the noodles separate which was much appreciated so that they didn't get too soggy.   Would def order again or make a trip to the restaurant!",

    "text": "OVERALL: decent Chinese food with slightly expensive prices. I would be okay with coming here again - however, there are better options elsewhere in Pittsburgh for Sichuan food.   I lived in Sichuan for the first few years of my life, and love spicy food. I was delighted to find another Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh, so I went here with a group of friends to check it out. We ordered a bunch of traditional Chinese dishes, such as Chongqing spicy chicken, Mao's pork belly, dandan noodles, shredded pork with beancurd, watercress, and shui zhu niu ().   The taste of the food was a solid 3.5/5. It's  authentic for the most part, albeit a tad too sweet for me. I would give it a 4 because I liked the experience, but unfortunately I had to dock a point, because for every single dish I ordered, I could name a different restaurant in Pittsburgh that cooks it better. Not to say that the food was bad - I definitely enjoyed it - but there are better options out there. The dishes I enjoyed the most were the shui zhu niu and chongqing spicy chicken. However, the dandan noodles were cooked in a very strange way, and the watercress was not fresh. I would stay away from those dishes in the future.",

They changed the interior and it looks bigger with more rooms for some reason.  They did a good job with the interiors.  Our waitress was nice and had a big smile on her face, which is always nice.  I like the food, but they serve some kind of strange rice that I never had before.  It is a bit stiff and tougher, which makes me not a big fan of the rice.  I did however enjoy the rest of our food, minus the fact that I kind of wish the chicken was cooked a bit more.  It was kind of a mixed bag for me on this one.  I got Kung Pao chicken and there was pluses, including that there was big chunks of ginger in there and garlic.  That was a plus, but there was sooo much chicken.  I think a lot of people would like that, but it dominated the entire plate.  I think that Kung Pao should be a mixture of the celery, peanuts, onions, garlic, chicken and whatever other vegetables are in the dish.  They give you generous portions which is also a bonus.  When it comes to Chinese food I am just very picky because there are so many crappy, below average and mediocre Chinese restaraunts, but not one that stands out as extremely good.  Oh well, maybe one day I will find one.",

My typical order is edamame and a roll of choice (I love their rainbow roll and anything with the word tempura - obviously.)  The sesame chicken is as consistent as ever and is always ordered by my companion.   Service is immensely friendly and quick. Please give this place some love, they deserve it!",
