The sandwich is among the best I had in Pittsburgh and worth a try. The soup was tasty, too. I wasn't a fan of their crab cake, but guess I shouldn't order it at the first place considering the price (come on, what kind of crab cake do I expect to get with a few bucks only?!)",

I expected standard bar food and was super impressed by the homemade quality of everything we ordered.  After 8pm, they have a special low-price menu with $4 appetizers,$5 sandwiches and burgers, and a great wing and pitcher special. We ordered both appetizers to share amongst the group. The provolone wheel was literally a round of provolone breaded, fried, and topped with sauce. Best eaten by just digging in with a fork, it is melty cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was spot on as well, just sweet enough to cut through the richness of all the cheese. The fried zucchini was the real surprise - amazingly light, crispy breading with a mild seasoning. I've never really liked fried zucchini because it tends to get soggy and limp. I don't know what their secret is, but I would order this fried zucchini every time!  For my meal I enjoyed the burger with american cheese. It was juicy with a nice chargrilled flavor (reminded me of a good quality Burger King patty haha, I mean that as a compliment!) and the toppings were fresh. A solid burger. My hubby quickly devoured the meatball sub so I didn't get a chance to try it, but he was impressed. We both enjoyed the homemade fries that accompanied the sandwiches - spice blend game strong.  The bartender that's usually working is super sweet and makes sure that nobody waits too long for a drink. The owner is an awesome guy as well. Always comes out to say hi to the regulars and introduces himself to anyone that he doesn't recognize. Overall, a really great local bar/restaurant.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to try a new restaurant on Brookline Blvd only to find it was closed on Mondays. So I checked out Yelp and decided to to try this restaurant. It's a little awkward because the door to the bar is on the Main Street but you have to walk down an alley to get to the door of the dining room.  We were the only ones in the dining room. The bartender came to give is menus and to take our drink orders. She was very nice and explained what the dinner special was. A few minutes later the owner or head chef came to our table. He was really funny. He had a very thick Italian accent. He told my husband to try the special and told me I should try the lemon chicken. His name was Lou and he takes food seriously.  My husband ordered the special-Chicken Chiu Chiu pasta. It was grilled chicken, sliced banana peppers, mushrooms, and rigatoni noodles. It sounds pretty simple but whatever they put in the sauce was absolutely delicious. I am not able to eat spicy food so while this dish carried a little heat I could have eaten it. I was bummed I had not ordered it myself.  I ordered the Lemon Chicken and was pleasantly surprised. Usually Lemon chicken has a lemon sauce that only has a hint of lemon. Because of that I asked if it came with capers. The waitress told me no but that they would put some on for me. Once I tasted the dish I realized that the sauce was so good that it didn't need capers. It was the best Lemon Chicken I had ever had. The portion size was huge.  It was a surprise that my meal was just chicken-no sides or even a salad. Even though my order was all chicken I took half of it home. My husband's dish came with garlic bread but no sides or salad. He took 1/3 of his home.  The prices were low, portions were huge, and our meals were great. We want to go back to try more of their dishes.",

I ordered the chicken parmigiana and he ordered the chicken marsala and both were very tasty. My house salad was delicious as well. Lots of veggies, croutons and olives. Only thing about my dish was that I could tell they used frozen breaded chicken and didn't make it fresh. It still tasted great but this is not an authentic Italian restaurant. However for the price I still highly recommend.   I was looking forward to some fresh bread to go with my side of pasta but unfortunately it was cold and stale. If I'd change one thing about this place it would be to step it up with the bread - that would make a world of difference.",

Parmigiana, no matter the contents, should be freshly breaded and a light fry. Not coated in a heavy batter. Same goes for the provolone wheel. It had visible freezer burn and was brought to the table within 5 minutes of being ordered. Obviously not prepared at order. The bread was not fresh either. I'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes.   We would have left once seeing the very very limited menu if our server wasn't sweet and we had enough cash to cover our drinks and a tip for her. We stuck it out and left with no intention to return.",

Love that... we could hear the chef yelling the answer she came out and told us even though we had already heard the answer.  I ordered the Reuben my wife ordered the beacon cheese burger. The bread was light and perfectly tested.  the sourcrout was very nice and I suspect actual Russian dressing,  the corned beef was hot flavorful and moist it was delicious.

It came stand alone and the pasta on the side at cost.  I had the old tried and True spaghetti and meatballs.  The veal was excellent.  Breaded ever so lightly, fried gently. Very flavorful.  The meatballs, delicious.  The spaghetti sauce, sweet and incredibly flavorful.  We both had the wedding soup, and my only regret was that I didn't order a bowl.  Broth, escarole, carrot, meat....a classic done superbly well.  We each had an alcohol drink, one wine, one beer. Bill came to about $15 for the both.    Great food and at an affordable price.  Ill be back.    The dining room is behind the bar.  Food can be eaten in the bar, but not my scene.  The doing room is basically 10 tables around 2 pool tables.  No atmosphere but in classic Italian tradition its a no frills room to eat a meal filled with goodness.  Four stars -- food is great, service wonderful, prices are excellent. Dining room with two pool tables, yuk.",

A huge plus is that it is non smoking! It was mostly filled with regulars during Friday happy hour. The very friendly bartender was also playing hostess and waitress but greeted us quickly. They had $4 import drafts and bottles on special. I got an Angry Orchard and my date, Dan,  got a Blue Moon draft- they had a nice beer selection. The menu was rather limited with a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and pasta options. I went with a house salad and bowl of wedding soup. The wedding soup was very good with homemade meatballs but it was served in a very tiny cup but still the pricing of a bowl. My salad was fresh and came with tomatoes, olives, chick peas and peppers. Dan ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwhich served with homemade chips. The sandwich was huge and the chips had a sweet BBQ flavor. Our dinner was $25 so very reasonable prices. We will be back!",

It seems like a typical mousehole of a bar upon first glance, blending in seamlessly with all the other establishments that populate this side of the Boulevard.   Who knew they had a nice, and spacious dining room in the back, complete with a big flatscreen TV?   I really had no idea what to order as the dinner fare is typical upscale American/Italian; lots of seafood, steak, pasta, veal, and chicken dishes.   A little cherub told me they had excellent meatballs, and I can't get enough ground meat, so I got the Spaghetti and Meatballs.   My only errr...beef about it was that I only got two meatballs, but they were as fat, flavorful, and rich as any I have ever had. One more would have been nice though.  They are generous with the spaghetti, which is al dente, thick like bass strings, or Todd McFarlane's rendition of Spidey's webs. Tom DeFalco, Editor In Chief of Marvel at the time and Italian himself, called it \"spaghetti webbing.\" Moonlite Cafe's spaghetti is why.   The sauce was THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS! So was the juice that seeped to the bottom of the plate. I used to wonder why some people refused to eat spaghetti sans bread. What else are you gonna sop up all that delightful mess left behind with?  My friend let me taste the Moonlite Ziti, and it was very garlicky with nice bits of tomato adorning the plate.   The salad I ordered came with an atomic house dressing too.   Was tonight's secret word \"TANGY?\"   Well, at least the Moonlite Cafe is no longer a secret. Venture into Brookline and come here if you like good, classy, but simple, traditional food.",

When my realtor insisted I try this place, I thought, \"well I am hungry, and the fridge is empty...\" and so off went the boyfriend and I.   Louie, the owner, was there. He spied us immediately and wanted to know our story. Apparently this is a place for regulars. We fit right in. This guy is THE MAN. He was so nice, and so welcoming, as was his large and loud Italian family that were dining there that night. Hey, these are my people. We love to eat, we love to talk, and we love our wine and dessert. Moonlite has it all; atmosphere, food, family, and a full bar. The employees are good people. The bartenders know their stuff. I suspect close to everything is homemade down to the croutons in the salad (and if not it tastes the part) and the desserts are too (not there, they order them locally, which is also awesome!)  I would never have found this place. It looks like nothing special from the outside, and nothing too fancy on the inside either, but who cares? It's delicious, and I love coming here. I have probably tried everything on the menu at this point and that's not an exaggeration. Everything is good, simple, and perfectly done. It's exactly what Italian should be. AUTHENTIC with HUGE portions. Suck it Olive Garden, I never liked you anyway.   Seriously, check this place out.. It's a gem. Simplicity is key in good Italian cooking and they nail it. The veal is perfect every time, the zucchini mountain is spot on, and all the pasta dishes are great. Try the Sicilian dinners too; if you know the difference between Sicilian and Italian, you will definitely appreciate them.",

    "text": "The Moonlite Cafe is one of my favorite spots in the Brookline/Beechview area.   Their Italian cuisine is extremely good and is extremely reasonably priced, especially so with their daily specials. On Thursdays you can get parmesan chicken with a side and pasta for only $9.99. It's also very delicious.   The draft selection is limited but is served ice cold in frosted glasses. And when I say ice cold, I mean it. Often times some beer slush will accumulate at the top of my drink. It's delicious.   The staff is also very friendly and are quick.   I highly recommend the wedding soup and chicken Parmesan.",

We came to Moonlite to watch the Steeler game, which was super great on the nice flat screens that they have in the bar area. Like other reviews, this bar was SUPER CLEAN! I mean sparkling clean, which really never happens. Also, like other reviews, yes - from the outside this place looks like a dive bar. However, once you walk in the door you are greeted by super friendly employees, and a very friendly vibe. Moonlite is definitely a place that you go to, receive great service, and then are remembered the next time you come in.   For this trip, we just ordered some appetizers/drank while watching the game. The bartender was new, and still did an awesome job. Drinks were reasonably priced, and she did a great job keeping up even though the bar area was slammed for the game. Appetizers were.. awesome! cheese wheel, yum - marinara sauce that they serve was wonderful as well. Fried zucchini was the biggest portion I've ever seen.  I will definitely be back here! Can't wait to check out more of their food.",

I'm pretty much a wing fan fanatic and was pleasantly surprised at to hear this place had great wings.   I was drawn to Buffalo Blue and Hot garlic parm. The only knock I have is the time it took for the wings to come out. The place didn't seem that crowded, but my group was in the back area.   After the first bite I understood why it took so long. These bad boys were fried to perfection. (I like mine crunchy) Great ratio of flats to drums. Flavors I picked were incredible.",

It is easily two meals.  If you are looking for a place with nice bartenders, good food, and a great beer selection... look no further!",

    "text": "I was in need of something greasy, something to satisfy my pit in my stomach and when Moonlite Cafe was suggested, I said why not?  Walking in you are greeted by the neighborhood sports bar vibe.  Especially since I came here during the Pirates game.  The bar was lined by what looks liked regulars and Pirates fanatics.  Some high top tables lined the perimeter of the room making for getting a seat a bit of a task, but once seated we were fine.  At the time we were there, we basically did it all ourselves.  We had to go to the bar to ask for menus and back to the bar to order.  The food was delivered to the table, but by the looks of it, and with how busy it was here, they only had the bartender working at that point.  That's not to detract from the fact that we received amazing service and that bartender was one bad ass.  She gave it right back to the regulars and kept it moving.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and he got a meatball hoagie.  I wasn't expecting much from a bar burger but I ended up surprised.  The patty was thick and juicy, cooked to your liking.  Topped with cheese and expertly cooked bacon.  Lettuce and tomato on the side so you can add if you like, nice move as to not water down the bun before diving in.  Condiments are giving to you prior so you can put as much of any condiment you like on your burger.  Each burger/sandwich is served with house potato chips.  They were amazing as well.  I still cannot figure out what the seasoning was that topped these, but they were amazing.  As for the meatball hoagie, it was HUGE.  Three big meatballs covered in marinara and cheese.  Satisfying?  Yes.  Price point is on target as well, did not break the bank.  Specials every night of the week.  Some decent beers on tap.",

The price of the food might seem a bit high for the divey feel of the establishment, but it is really pretty good, so the price probably is more in line with the quality.   That being said, I do still go for the specials, like wing nights! 60 wings (I believe) on Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. (Double check that-its been a while!) 8-10pm has some good bar specials on food and drinks. Daily drink specials and a good special most days.  Bar area in front and tables in the back. Its a chill place that I intend to frequent more.",

They have some good apps, like the provolone wheel, but they also have some very bad food. Never get the Louis's Hot sausage sandwich, just don't. Everyone that has had it came down with the case of the runs. Before I knew this I was told to give it a try, well I did. I was up at 230am puking my guts out because of the low quality sausage. I have now missed a day of work because of their subpar cooking staff.   I'm pretty sure this place either pays for people to review it or they have their employees give a bunch of good reviews, no way they should be rated above a 3.",

    "text": "At first glance you may think this is a Pittsburgh dive bar that serves some bar snacks.  Wow you would be wrong!! Visited this place last night from high Yelp reviews - so glad I did! First of all, the place is exceptionally clean- something I was very happy to see especially because it is mainly a bar! Even with having a large bar, pool tables, and poker machines, it is clean and inviting. There are many large flat screen tvs in the dining area - I would say 8 or so. All are modern and have a great picture quality.  The menu is comprised of fried appetizers, sandwiches, pizza, and Italian dinners. I was in a pasta mood so I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs (I added a picture to the restaurant listing)- a deal at 8.99, although a side salad is about $3-4 more- it is worth the money with roasted red peppers, chickpeas, olives, tomatoes, and croutons. My boyfriend opted for the prosciutto and arugula thin crust pizza (picture has been added to the gallery)- it was a feast for the eyes and the stomach - would highly recommend. The other star of the night was the spicy garlic parmesan wings. WOW. I first discovered this sauce when I was in college (one of the local pizza shops created a delicious take on it) and have since not been able to find to mimic the wings I loved so much. They knocked this sauce out of the park! If you like spicy, but not too spicy, with a good tang, give them a try. They cooked the wings perfectly with a nice crunch on the outside skin. I can't wait to order them again.   Don't ignore this local spot! Check it out!",

We popped in for an early dinner and some beer one night and we soon returned, and have since been back twice in a short amount of time. The part that drew us in - it is a neighborhood bar that does not allow smoking indoors! The part that kept us coming back - the food!  The bartenders are all very nice and the service in general is fantastic. The owner has been there every night we go and he helps out, which is nice to see!   We LOVE the food. The menu isn't huge. This is a casual neighborhood bar that serves delicious italian food. They have sandwiches, salads, wings, mozzarella sticks, other appetizers and a few entrees. The chicken parm is my favorite dish I've tried so far. My husband is obsessed with the lemon chicken. We have also tried their wings, which were great! The entrees come with bread (from Brookline's Deluca's if I'm not mistaken) and a salad. The prices are very reasonable.  We have also really enjoyed coming here to watch sports. We've been going to Moonlite a lot lately to watch the Penguins in the playoffs and that's been pretty fun! It's easy to get a table or a seat at the bar to watch the game and enjoy some drinks and food.   Oh and there are two billiards / pool tables in the big back room if you're into that!  For parking there are parking spots all up and down Brookline Blvd. The spots on one side of the street are pull-in/pull-out spots and the other side of the street are parallel spots. You can pay at the station or with the app.",

The food options include a decent variety of Italian entrees and a delicious array of appetizers. Of course, the two best parts of the Moonlite Cafe experience are the authenticity and the taste. Everything appears (and most likely is) homemade and made with traditional Italian love and care. You will not get this quality and taste at any ordinary restaurant. My personal recommendations are the calzones and the raviolis (when they are the special). The environment is welcoming, the service is great, and the food is wonderful. I recommend checking Moonlite out, and possibly becoming a regular.",
