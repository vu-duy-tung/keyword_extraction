    "text": "Met a friend here for dinner on a Saturday night around 7:15pm and the wait wasn't bad at all. Once we ordered, a table magically appeared for us. The process of ordering/ saving a table could have been more clear. Several people also waiting commented they didn't know the \"ordering/seating procedure.\"  The menu had a good bit to chose from and the variety was great. I wanted to order the pirogies but couldn't as I'm a person who doesn't like mushrooms and they were not able to separate the varieties -- bummer. I did order a sandwich with beets and it was a-m-a-z-i-n-g. That said, it was just the sandwich and I left still needing to eat more. I didn't realize it wouldn't come with at least a side salad for the $9 price tag. Even up the price to include a salad or side.   The atmosphere was casual and great other than the smokiness that kept circulating the room. My jacket still smells. :(",

    "text": "The concept at Apteka is modern, fun, and sleek - vegan food at its best. Location is easy with lots of street parking on the stretch of Penn Ave across from the Allegheny Cemetary.  The atmosphere was nice, welcoming, and not too crowded on a tuesday evening. A lovely patio out back and good amount of seating in a simple but stylish air.  The food was fantastic. The Pierogis were excellent, all parts of them. Excellent dough, prefectly made; the mushroom variety was my favorite. Also very thoughtful and superb black bean and arugula salad, and a potato starter that was very nice.  Starters are between $5-8, and salads around $10. An order of 7 Peirogis was $11. All in all, though I am not a vegan, I will come back.",

Mixed age/ethnicity diners, but yeah it is not super cheap.  I had not had polish food before, if you don't count some random borsht and cabbage rolls.  I had the pierogies and the kluski.  Very interesting and tasty!  Kluski comes with a mushed up bean puree kinda deal--good flavor.   Several cabbage type veggies on top, some bitter, some not.  Cute little dumplings that are fun to eat.  There were two kinds of pierogies in the 4 pack, but honestly, I wasn't really listening.  One was more peppery and had cabbage.  Other was more potato-y but also maybe had cabbage.  They came with some crema type stuff on top, cucumber pickles, and beet salad.  My favorite things were the pickles, beets, and beans.  I also had a fancy gin drink which was good but kinda just tasted like a tom collins.  Price was $29 for everything plus a tip for bartender.  Dinner plus ap was enough for 2 not so hungry people or one hungry person.    Would def return!",

That said, all of the other dishes were phenomenal as well..  The food is surprisingly cheap given the quality of ingredients and preparation. I'd be pleased to get these dishes as part of a fancy schmancy tasting menu, yet I was able to get them instead in the comfortable, inviting environs of Apteka at a fraction of the price. This place is truly remarkable. I'm hope to come back soon.",

    "text": "This place is really unique and delicious.  I am a meat eater, but I like to eat as little as I can to help the environment more. This is one of the places that could convince me that I don't need to eat it at all.  They have super creative dishes that are homemade and tasty.  I've been here twice now and only got one thing that a small disappointment (stuffed cabbage with bulgar wheat).  It's currently not on the menu, so I think they got enough feedback that it was just \"meh.\"  On the latest visit we got the pierogis, tartines, both kinds of sandwiches (Baba Jaga and Special) and the kluski slaskie.   All were either very good or excellent.  Pierogis were definitely the favorite of the table.  The only quibble with the sandwiches were that they were messy to eat with hands (but so tasty!).  So I tried to cut and eat them and it was hard to cut the bread with a knife for some reason.  Our neighbors got the soup and they said it was delicious.  At the end, we had the Piernik dessert which was gingerbread with prune puree in the middle.  One of my friends thought it was too much prune (I think a personal preference).  I did not feel the same. I that it worked well together and was a great ending to a very different eating experience.    Logistics of the restaurant are a little different than normal sit down places.  You have to know what you want when you walk in and go to the counter to order.  Then they give you a number, you have to find a place to sit and your food is brought to you.  You still have a server who refills water, clears plates and brings you a box. I'm not sure what would happen if you forgot to order something and wanted to add it.  Would you have to wait in line again or could your server add something on and charge you for it?  Probably because they also serve cocktails and beer so you might want to order more of those, but not sure.  My recommendation is go online and look at the menu, confirm that it's still on the board when you get there and order everything at beginning.  They won't bring your dessert until you ask for it which was nice.",

When we went I got the Riga balsam cocktail, which was probably the best mixed drink I've ever had, as well. I highly recommend that if it is still on the menu when you visit. My only complaint is that it was a little frustrating ordering at the counter. The place seems busy and fancy enough to justify not having customers order at the counter, at least for dinner service.

Plus I had an interesting tequila-based cocktail that was great.  Very surprised how tasty and satisfying vegan food could be (no offense meant to any vegans or vegetarians reading this).  The restaurant is Eastern European, so it was nice to hear the gentleman behind the bar pronounce my Polish last name correctly-- then let me know that they do serve stinging nettle (what my name means) tea!

I have not liked any of the deserts I've tried and feel as if the desserts really seem \"vegan.\" Nothing else at this restaurant has been disappointing for me and I've tried almost everything they've offered on multiple different seasonal menus.  We most recently brought four friends here and we ordered *everything* to share, except for dessert and the two soups they were offering at the time. And again everything was delicious.   The sandwiches have always been my favorite and often times include very interesting and wonderful veggie pate. I've also had their pirogies every time I've been to Apteka and I've never missed sour cream. During this last visit we ordered both salads and I was pleasantly surprised with the unique flavors each salad offered.   Last, but not least favorite thing about Apteka- their cocktails. I have tried at least 5-6 different cocktails and would recommend any of them. They are consistently refreshing and delicious. Perfectly made in a way that they are very drinkable but are not boring or too sweet.   Overall, Apteka is wonderful. It's great for most people, even if you're usually a meat eater. If you like eating unique and flavorful food, Apteka is a must visit.",

    "text": "Full disclaimer: I'm not vegan.  However, I think good food is good food and I am willing to try anything once. I've heard a lot of great things about Apteka and see it recommended on many Pittsburgh \"late-night eats\" and \"best perogies\" lists. I just so happened to be craving perogies at 10pm on a Thursday night and decided to give it a try. I dragged my (also not a vegan) brother with me. The interior was warm and inviting on a cold November night. They definitely embraced the earthy elements with lots of floral and plants as decor.   You order at the counter when you walk-in, we were working with the late night menu, which is a little more limited, so we both ordered the highly recommended perogies. My brother had a beer from a local brewery and I ordered a vodka cocktail. It was made with sunflower oil and some sort of flower (possibly a dandelion) floating in it. It was honestly one of the best vodka cocktails I've had in my life (my brother tasted and agreed). To be completely honest, I didn't eat the floating flower.   Unpopular opinion... I just didn't get the hype. The perogies, had lots of flavor like people previously mentioned, I just can't say that I enjoyed the flavor. There appeared to be two different types of perogies one that was better (in my opinion) than the other. Menu says... Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. The Mushroom perogies were definitely the ones I didn't like, they just had this overpowering shroom flavor that left an unpleasant almost \"dirt\" aftertaste.  Apparently if you're a vegan this food is amazing, I'm clearly not cut out for that life. Neither of us even finished our meals and it was about $40 for the two drinks and the perogies. I'd come back for another vodka cocktail, but I don't foresee any food orders in my future.",

The atmosphere is addicting.  The staff is beyond friendly.  I come here often, and often I am alone.  The staff always makes me feel welcome.  The guy you order from at the front is maybe one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. EVERY TIME!  His consistency with every customer is so impressive.  He knows the menu and guides you through the experience so well.  Their head bartender is a wizard.  Because I am often alone here, I get lost watching the operation flow.  It always amazes me how seamless they operate this very tiny restaurant.   If you are vegan, this is a must.  If you are not a vegan, still a must!  This place has stolen my heart and not just because of their food.  I just enjoy being here!",

    "text": "I LOVE this place!!  First off, the decorations inside are very relaxing - all white and light everywhere. There is a carport in the back that was converted to a dining room and a pretty sizable garden in the back with seats. You can order at the front counter or at the bar (once you've made your initial order at the front counter). My friend and I split a number of dishes and they were all SO GOOD.  We started with the Kanapki which is esentially a few different spreads on toast. My favorite of these was the roast carrot pure which was so delicious!!  Then we moved onto the Boczniaki z kapusta which was beer braised cabbage with butternut miso and rye crumb. OMG that butternut miso was SO GOOD, we were practically licking the plate. That whole dish was probably my favorite.  Next was the Salatka with smoked chilli, burnt carrot, sunflower shoots, and burnt sunflower seeds. I had no idea that so many burnt things could add up to such a delicious dish. I guess I need to burn my food more often.   For dessert we split both the apple tart and the yogurt bilberry. The yogurt was made of cashews! I've never tried nut yogurt before so this was really exciting! I liked both dishes a lot though the apple tart I liked more. We also each got a fancy soda (I had the wildflower soda and my friend had the poppy seed soda).  After all that each of us only paid $22! Such a deal for such an amazing meal! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!",

Also, we asked the gentleman working the counter, who took our order (Jack, who was very friendly and knowledgeable), what would go best with our main picks. He was right on point. The cocktails sounded great, but I ended up having the Draai Laag table beer. This place scored major points for having both Roundabout and Draai Laag on tap.   No doubt we'll be back!!!",

    "text": "I was surprised by the high rating of this restaurant and my experience as it certainly was not the same. As a vegan I am always on the lookout for a wonderful vegan experience and this was unfortunately it. Let me break it down for you.   Unlike a True upscale restaurant you order as you come in the door. The menu is written on table paper and pinned to the wall. After you order you have to walk around and find an available table. We were fortunate that we found one fairly quickly.   Meals: bland. Because I am unfamiliar with the type of food Apteka serves I  ordered the 2nd dish on the large plates and had my partner order the peorogies. I was surprised that my meal was actually a salad. Why would I go to a vegan restaurant to order a salad when I can get that anywhere...this is what my friends said when my order came. The salad was good but not great.  My partner shared his meal with me but the sauce tasted sour so I didn't like it.   Cons: I don't like ordering my dinner at a counter, grabbing my silverware and finding my own table in this type of restaurant. While the servers, or food runners, were pleasant they did not come back to check on you.   Positives: the service and atmosphere. The food came quickly and the atmosphere was great although a little too dark for my liking.   I am truly upset that I cannot support my community of vegans but this is not an establishment that I nor my friends would visit again. For a True pleasant vegan experience I'll go back to the Doublewide Grill.",

    "text": "Yesterday was the Unblurred or First Fridays on Penn. After watching the weather all day we decided, \"Hooray, no rain\", and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave, but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy, but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table, she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes, just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate, two large ones, and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly.   Small Plates:  Boczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in, some of our other bread in it, and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure.   Big Plates: Pierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami / seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly, I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens, some turnips, and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic, the turnips were good, and the pierogies, they were ok. I liked the dough, I liked the presentation, I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others.   Special Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple, but wowza, what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate, something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal.   Dessert: Tarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat.   The place was beautiful, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was great. I cannot wait to come back. I am so happy to be able to come here on such a fun Friday night. It really made the start of the weekend so much better.",

    "text": "My husband and I finally got around to breaking our B52 habit and tried Apteka. After all of the amazing things that we kept hearing, we figured it was finally time.  To start - we tried the potato dumplings and the pierogis. (This will be the extent of me knowing what I was eating.) Both were super delicious; and we followed the food runner's suggestion of eating the dumplings first, while they were still hot. The pierogis had a crunchy texture on the outside, and full of flavor on the inside.  We ordered two more small plates, but what we ordered - I cannot remember what they were called, nor do I really know what I was eating. But they were also pretty delicious.   My only disappointment is that I never experienced that roll-my-eyes-in-the-back-of-my-head kind of flavor or texture (my husband also agrees). Don't get me wrong - it was good; but not at the level that I felt that I was being hyped up for. Compared to some of our other favorites: B52, Onion Maiden, and Gluten Free Goat - where every thing on the menu is orgasmic - we didn't feel that way at Apteka. I also felt that the music selection was a little too avant garde to create a comfortable atmosphere.   That being said, we will still return when we're craving some salty and earthy potatoes; especially if it's late at night. The space is wonderfully simple and feels open with a community feel. It's a great addition to the Penn Ave food scene.",

Everything is Vegan, which isn't really my forte but a group of us from work wanted to try it. Ordering was a little hard because a lot of the items, I've never heard of or don't know how to pronounce. The staff was helpful in giving suggestions as well. There was another group in front of us that was in the same boat as well, so we weren't the only ones! I played it safe and went with the pierogis. I also sampled the Kluski Slaskie (potato dumplings), Placki ziemniaczane z paprika (potato pancakes), and Boczniaki z kapusta (mushroom and cabbage). Everything was tasty. The mushroom pierogis were spicy, which I wasn't expecting but still enjoyed them. Everything else was good and flavorful as well. I feel you have to have a certain palate for this kind of food though. A lot of the ingredients I'm not familiar with or don't really like. But I'm glad I tried it. I wouldn't come here all the time but it's something different.",

    "text": "Neither my husband nor I are vegans, but I enjoy Eastern European food, so I wanted to try this restaurant. Around 6 PM on a Friday, we found a free parking spot on the street, and we entered the busy restaurant and asked for a table. They encourage you to order at the front rather than the table and to pay before the food arrives. I give the kanapki sandwiches 3 stars because I enjoyed the taste of two of the three of them. I give the barszcz 4 stars because of the strong beet-tasting broth, but I prefer some solids in my borscht. I give the pierogi 3 stars because I could not determine which flavor was which until I cut into them, and I liked the sauerkraut and mushroom flavor more than I liked the potato, parsnip, and turnip greens flavor. I give the golabki 3 stars because of the buckwheat filling. The total bill was ~$40 total including tip. The cashier/waitress was nice. No drink refills for the flower-flavored soda or the water were offered, but we were OK. We will not return to this restaurant, but I encourage you to try this restaurant if you are a vegan and enjoy Eastern European food.",

    "text": "Apteka lives up to the hype! I dig the laid back but classy atmosphere. There were fresh bouquets of flowers around the restaurant, felt big, great lighting and because of how hot it was they opened the back garage door to let a nice breeze flow through. The menu is up on the wall when you enter Apetka and you order at the counter right next to it. I wish the \"Order Here\" sign was bigger for people like me - I missed it totally and thought we would be served at our table but luckily my husband saw it when we first came in. I would have been sitting at our table awaiting menus for much longer... We had 4 pierogis, baba jaga and kanapki, all of which were delicious. The baba jaga is a substantial sandwich. I had a beer and my husband had the bourbon cocktail. I don't normally like bourbon but I liked this cocktail however my husband thought it wasn't bourbon-y enough for him. Parking is on the street and tables essentially are first come first serve. We will be back to Apetka such a fresh spin on a traditional cuisine.",

Their wine selection is minimal but amazing, the Italian red I got was velvety and delicious and their homemade wildflower soda was bananas good!   And after all was said and done, enough food to fill us both to the brim and a few drinks only set us back $40 plus tip. What!?!   Will definitely be back and can't wait to spread the word on this amazing local joint.   Bravo, Apteka!",

Despite the description of the cuisine, which might seem limiting -- there's actually a decent size menu that offers a variety of tastes and options that range from light to very filling. Remember that vegan doesn't mean gluten-free, so there's plenty of carbs available from dumplings in a delicious carrot broth (Kluski Slaskie) to pierogies with fun fillings to veggie sandwiches on rich bread. As a bonus, this casual and comfortable yet hip eatery is open late nights with a more limited, but still delicious menu. There's a full bar with some clever cocktails, craft beers and a small selection of interesting wines. Service is simple with ordering done at the counter just inside the front door, take your carafe of water and order number, choose a table and it won't be long before your picture perfect food arrives. Customer sitting at the bar can have an open tab, thus replicating full table service. The staff appears to be young and ambitious, taking pride in their craft.",

We ordered the pierogies, kluski slaski, and salatka. They have a decent amount of seating, so don't be alarmed by the lime. The restaurant interior has a really nice hip vibe with lots of fresh flowers.   The kluski slaski, which were the potato dumplings, were very good. The sauce they were in was very flavorful and made the dish. The potato dumplings alone were bland, but all the elements of the meaty mushrooms, cool dill sauce, and warm broth made an excellent bite. The pierogies were also delicious. Their dough was the perfect consistency. The salad was also an interesting mix as it had potatoes and fennel in it.   Overall, each dish was satisfying and you could never once tell they were vegan. Beware though, if you do not like dill steer clear of Apteka. Every dish had dill in it. Their prices are also very reasonable. A good option for vegans and vegetarians! We need to see more restaurants like this in Pittsburgh.",

I ordered the 3 tartines (which were celeriac, carrot, and beet) and the pierogis. She ordered the Salatka and the Kluskie Slaskie. It was a good mix of dishes, she had raved about the burnt sunflower seed in the salad which was a really unique flavor. The tartines were simple but tasty, I really enjoyed the beet variation. While pierogies aren't my favorite food I enjoy the mushroom option topped with the creamy sauce- the side of cucumbers and beets really made the dish refreshing and lighter. The Kluskie was unlike anything I've ever had before and the toasted grains really added a nice flavor and crunch. I would highly recommend this interesting dining sensation in Bloomfield, especially to my vegan and vegetarian friends.",

I also tried the gin, prosecco, pear, and hops cocktail. Delicious - not too strong nor too sweet.",

The meat is not missed...  If you get there before they open, there will be a small (may be larger on certain days) queue.  Upon opening, the line moves quickly.  They take your order at the bar as you walk in and you seat yourself.  It's a unique way of ordering, but it works well and is designed to get your noms quickly.  Don't panic, they don't rush you through your meal.  We had a lovely meal on the back patio.  For food, I had some smoked cabbage pierogi's that were heavenly.  A delicious placki (potato pancake) and some kluski slaskie (potato dumplings).  Topped off with an apple tart (that I had to take away to eat later because I was so full).  So good!  If you've had pierogis, these won't disappoint.  If you've never had Polish food, this just feels less heavy (less greasy) than a lot of other places.  I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I highly recommend this place, restaurants that are plant-based, but just serve good food are something that should be commended.  Good food is, simply good food.  Go meatless...you won't miss it all.",

Apteka has done an amazing job creating awesome plates that really highlight how great vegan food can be. The pumpkin soup was a great starter and the pierogis are on point. They are not your traditional potato-cabbage-cheese pierogis. They are unique and have great flavor combinations. They are smaller plates and make for super easy sharing between people. We ordered three different things and shared them between two people. Plenty of food for the both of us. It is important to be aware that this is not a traditional sit-down restaurant. It is more of a bistro that requires you to order prior to taking a seat. They menu is listed on a huge wall next to the counter for all to see. The atmosphere is also very calm and welcoming. Staff is friendly and the drinks are strong! Definitely a must try!",

Since I left, I've made a top 5 restaurants I HAVE to go to every time I visit Pittsburgh. Apteka makes it on there, without a doubt.   I've been here a few times with friends, and once for my department graduation banquet. All times were amazing!   It is sorta in the middle of nowhere - a standalone restaurant, across a cemetery. The ambience is quite... hipster (it's a vegan place for pete sake) and calming. Its layout reminds me a bit of a brighter version of Noodlehead with the large water jugs and seating arrangements.  It's a great place to hold a small to medium sized event, as you can book the whole restaurant. The service is great too. During the banquet, they were very accomodating and we even received table to table service from the servers!  The food comes out timely and is sooo good. If all vegan food tasted this way, I'd be willing to turn vegan no problem.",

It's very dimly lit, with the only light source being a candle at your table and limited seating because it does get PACKED. A lot of the times I almost forget i'm at a vegan place when eating here.

Fantastic and if vegan food all over tasted like this, I wouldn't sneer at it quite so much.  The food was really amazing. So much variety, creative and most importantly tasty! We tried more than half the menu and just about everything did not disappoint. Highlights were the peirogis and the faux fried cheese made with bubble mushroom which i had to ask twice if it was cheese! Potato dumplings were great as were the cabbage and oyster mushrooms. Only dish not so great was the potato pancakes...a little too soggy and not as much flavor.  I would gladly come back here any day of the week and proudly eat vegan!!!",

Don't be intimidated, don't think you won't get a good meal, and come with an open mind. If Eastern European food (Americanized or not) is up your ally, you won't be disappointed.  They work as a cafeteria style setup where you wait in line to order, find an open table (if you can) and wait for your food. Want to add another cocktail or a dessert? No need to get back in line, just order from one of the bartenders or waitstaff.   Don't know what your ordering? Ask lots of questions. The staff was wonderful and didn't act surprised or upset if you needed help with the menu.  My wife and I split three different plates including a large plate of pierogis (how can you not order pierogi here?!) and enjoyed every bite, and how affordable it was. The cocktails are more daunting but man, they were delicious. I had one that was scotch based with apple and seasoning which was delicious, while we wife had a plum liqueur based cocktail which was sour and refreshing.  It's no doubt they opened in the exact right neighborhood and everyone raved about the food on their way out as we overheard plenty of guests since we sat at the bar. Give em a try!",

Anyone who knows me, knows that I am obsessed with most European food so this is a great spot for me when I just happen to pass through Bloomfield.  It honestly surprises me just how great this place is (I am a carnivore for life). But honestly, I could eat here all the time and not even think twice about it.   Lets start with the fact that I can't pronounce 99% of the menu (but I always have a waiter that is patient with me and we usually end up having a few laughs over why crazy pronunciations). And while we are on the topic of waiters, my service has always been excellent. My food always comes out in an ample amount of time and they always seem glad to help if i have any questions.   We usually tend to get the big plates to share. My favorite is the Pierogi ( one has mushroom and sauerkraut, the other has apple, potato and horseradish).  Oh My Gosh. These have a flavor that you have never experienced before. And definitely not like any other piergoi you would find around here!  We also never leave without grabbing dessert. We almost always go for the Apple tart with a dried fruit compote. It is such a great combo. Was defiantly a wonderful surprise to my palate.  If you are anywhere near Bloomfied, I absolutely recommend trying this place out!",

I walked in and looked around, not knowing if I was supposed to seat myself or how ordering worked and had to ask one of the 4 people behind the bar if I should sit anywhere or wait to be seated. Would have appreciated being acknowledged and told how their process worked. No one walked over to my table in the first 10 minutes after I sat down... not even to offer water. Not great.   Food: Overall a 4/5. The pierogies and beet sandwich were incredible. I don't think I liked beets until trying the sandwich! The Salatka with sunflower shoots was... fine. The gin and prosecco cocktail was delicious. Super refreshing and I could have had 3 more! The apple crumble with sour cherry compote was UH-mazing. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of is that... dill. comes. on. everything. They are quite the fans of dill. You would hardly realize this menu is vegan...great options here.  Apteka fits in with the revamping third Renaissance that Pittsburgh is going through where hipsters abound and service is hands-off. I enjoy the food and drinks, but the service could definitely use some fine-tuning.",

Get the perogies because this is Pittsburgh, and because I told you to.  For real, they have a regular menu and a \"late night\" menu, all of which is excellent; fresh ingredients, flavorful, and DELICIOUS.  The perogie hoagie is my personal favorite- literal perogies and sauce and sauerkraut ON A FREAKING HOAGIE BUN. But real talk, you have to be \"on another level\" to eat it.  The 4 perogies are enough to fill up anyone. They come with a mix of types of perogies with beets on the side. Fresh to DEATH.  The bar at this establishment is also excellent. They feature a number of drafts (rotating) from local breweries. They also have a full bar with a list of signature cocktails.   The Staff The staff is super helpful and great at explaining the unique dishes. They're also great to suggest a good beer or cocktail.  They also work well as a team here, feel free to ask anyone for anything and they will oblige. And no one is below a 7. (I said it.)  The Ambience Things at Apteka are done cafe style. So, come in, order, sit at a seat of your choosing, and the staff brings your order to you. Good for small groups, because there's no worries about splitting checks- it's done UPFRONT. Larger groups can be accommodated, too, but seats together depend on the crowd that night.  The decor is minimal in nature- perhaps a bit too much for my tastes. The walls are cement and the ceiling is open, but I imagine a little more will come with time.  There are definitely hipsters left and right, I mean, look at the hood, so if you detest their type, stay away. HOWEVER, dope ppl of ALL ages come here, young to late 70s.",

I also tried the vodka cocktail and the tequila cocktail. Every bite and sip was a \"wow\" moment.  The staff working tonight were kind, patient, and totally kept their cool during the dinner rush.  I'm looking forward to the completion of the rear patio, which will open a full back wall of the restaurant. Additional seating will be a great benefit too!  Whether you're a vegan or not, do yourself a favor and check out Apteka!",

    "text": "This is one of the most interesting new restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Apteka serves Eastern European cuisine on Penn Ave near the hospital.   A lifelong carnivore,  I can honestly imagine living on Apteka's vegan dishes happily.  The tastes are unique and the dishes well prepared.   Try the Tartines, three different spreads on thick seeded bread.  The bread is fantastic, one of the owners is a former baker at La Gourmandine Bakery and has brought his craft to Apteka. The Tartine toppings include carrot pate and radish pickle; leek, Apple and mint and celery, pickle, apple and dill.   All are culinary delights.  Other small plates include beet soup with celeriac toast; Kartofle (pictured) which features potatoes, apples, lingonberry jam (mmm) and yogurt; Belgian endive with pickled prune and beech and oyster mushrooms.   All are delicious.  Big plates include pierogis (a Pittsburgh staple, but these are among the best I have sampled), see pictures.  Four is enough for sampling.  Golabki is an interesting cabbage, buckwheat, roasted tomato and bay bolete dish.  I have not tried the sorrel salad but a friend described it as excellent.  Apteka also offers sandwiches,  try the horse and pepper (pictured) which includes a vegetable pate, horseradish slaw, pepper relish, black garlic butter and chilies on a roll.  They have a variety of interesting cocktails and an interesting beer list.  For a non-alcoholic drink try the birch water.  Under no circumstances should you skip the deserts.  If you are like me, and try the apple tart with dried fruit compote, you may never try the others, though the spiced gingerbread with poached pear and prune preserves may eventually catch a wandering eye.  The restaurant has caught quite a following in a few weeks since opening and for good reason.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Gourmet vegan without pretension in the food or setting. What an incredible culinary experience . I have never anywhere on this planet had such an extraordinary vegan meal, with combinations of flavors and textures that were really utterly terrific. We all talked about the meal trying to figure out why it was so good-every single dish was a swirl of melding and related flavors and we shared about 10! I think it came down to this: the foundation of almost each dish is a classic recognizable food item you know , like a dense potato pancake or a pierogi but the fillings and dough  add other ingredients that work  and the sauces (the sauces, o the sauces, just way beyond Wow), well  yes , you will lick your plates even if your upbringing strictly forbade such vile behavior. And, why it all works is simple: this is not (Con)fusion cooking by some full of herself chef who throws together flavors from different traditions just because. These flavor and texture combinations are pure art (and no doubt endless hours in the kitchen of finding out how things go together). Then beyond these dishes there are some very unique choices. A sunflower head last night. For some (me), just not imaginable to eat that, for others at our table, an unimaginable delight.  Then there were other dishes that are simply beyond my ability to describe in any specific detail at all beyond that oyster mushrooms were involved - a combination of vegetables, dressings, sauces, burnt offerings, melted down jewels, ground up ambrosia . Just beyond anything I have seen or eaten anywhere. And then even  the potato salad and carrot salads were a revelation. Again, based on something familiar but made into something much much more. Without pretension, with passion.  And after you have had the sour cherry pierogi (after which I could have just rolled over, said thank you O Lord for allowing me to have a vegan child who moved to Pittsburgh , and I would have blissfully left the planet) , then , then, ask about the desserts . Do not say you are too full. We shared the ciastro gruska cake. I am at a loss for words.    And I am not even a vegan.",

For food I've had (so far):  Pierogis (yum!), the baba jaga (fantastic sandwich and heavy); my favorite - kartofle (potato apple lingonberry yogurt), and the vegetarian special sandwich (not my favorite).  Everythign is really well made, and you don't go home hungry!  Know before you go:  Craft cocktails are different and you have to go with an open mind, also, you will line up at the door, place your order, be handed a number and then go sit (Panera style)- this can be a bit awkward as you can have a number and possibly not a table?!",

    "text": "Really unexpected is the best way to describe Apteka in my opinion. I arrived thinking it would be an upscale vegan spot with menus, sit down table service, a swanky bar and some description of the menu items before ordering....and nope Apteka is not really any of that! I felt as though I was dining in either a foreign country or Hawthorne in Portland maybe (it is that level of hip).  The menu is written on a large scroll in charcoal pencil with little to no info/context on what the heck you are ordering when you walk in. I am not picky so I didn't really mind this, but it definitely put the pressure on to make a game time decision with the massive line behind me. We ordered the special sandwich of the day which had caramelized apples and onions I think and was on a baguette, and the Baba Jaga (basically a ton of pickled things with grainy mustard, their veggie pate, and on homemade bread). For a beverage I got the tequila and wildflower.   You grab a table number and snag a seat if there is one open! Luckily we got the last open table in front of the bar. I enjoyed the atmosphere of Apteka for the most part, although I felt it was a little too brightly lit for dinner time if I am being wildly picky. Otherwise I really liked the all white interior, with minimalistic decor and dried flowers and branches throughout.   Our food and cocktails arrived, the drinks were strong and delicious and damnnn for $6 per cocktail? Insane bargain for the quality. The sandwiches were delicious and so, so filling. I could only eat about 1/2 my Baba Jaga. The homemade bread to me was the standout of my meal though I made the fatal flaw of not ordering the pierogies. Anyway back to the bread-- it was super dense, packed with all types of seeds and, crumbly yet sturdy, some of the best bread I have had in a while and coming from Philly, ya know that is some good bread!  We got the rest of our sandwiches to go, our bellies packed with enough fermented foods/probiotics to last us for about a week. I will absolutely be back and I will not miss the pierogies next time.",

It was a pleasant surprise for me, because I tend to find Polish food to be rather boring - it's not on my usual rotation. However, Apteka has the best pierogi I've had and I'm not usually a fan of stuffed cabbage, but the one here was very good. To top it all off, there is a pretty good cocktail menu. The only downside is that it can take a while to order and the space gets very loud - it's hard to maintain a conversation here.",

    "text": "I guess when you're a vegan restaurant it's important that people know you're a vegan restaurant.  You know...so the vegans know how to find you.  And...bear with me here...that makes sense.  But Apteka isn't a good vegan restaurant.  Or...perhaps it's more accurate to say instead, Apteka isn't JUST a good VEGAN restaurant.  It's a good restaurant.  Yeah...there's no meat on the menu.  Or...you know...dairy or eggs or fish and stuff.   So I suppose if you're dining with someone that REQUIRES meat.  Like...like Count Dracula for example.  If you and the Count are dining, this is a bad selection.  But apart from Count Dracula, or other people...like those too hidebound to attempt something with the \"Vegan\" label...this is a good restaurant.  No additional qualifiers required.  Secondly...I sampled four cocktails from their bar.  All from the menu (before you think, ugh, Jesus, Jim, not another drunk review...one of the drinks was just a taste of my date's drink).  And they were each better than the last.  REALLY well balanced nicely thought out drinks.  Can't really go wrong.    The pierogies were excellent.  The tartines were superb.  The Boczniaki z kapusta was good, not great...the cabbage was a little clunky to eat.  It resisted my efforts to cut it into mouthful sized pieces.  The flavors were nice though.  We capped our evening with the \"special sandwich\".  We just saw it pass our table too many times not to give it a try.  It didn't disappoint.  Our server was a menacing looking fellow all betatted and armful with a perpetual scowl.  Which sounds like a bad thing, but if you asked him a question he would just light up like a kid at christmas and tell you ALL THE THINGS, beaming and gushing and very knowledgable and the contrast was so friggin' delightful that I kept asking him stuff to watch him transform over and over from menacing to kid-at-christmas and back again.  Probably the biggest criticism I have to the place is that it's lit in a way that is not conducive to artful pictures.  You know we MUST have pictures of our food.  And no matter which way we positioned glasses or seats or plates...there was always some weird shadow.    Work on it, Apteka.  The people must post.  Anyway...I'll be back.  Meat or no meat.",

First impressions were great: cozy, modern ambience bathed in warm light and a great sunny area in the back. Courteous cashier and attentive wait staff.  We were happily basking in the ambience when the food came:  * a mushroom, dill and chive soup with mushroom dumplings * 2 kinds of grilled crisp pierogis: one stuffed with potato/kale, and the other with mushrooms * potato dumplings in a thick spicy carrot sauce  * 3 tartines: mushroom, beet, and pickled cabbage * sandwich with some kind of crispy nut patty, beets, caramelized onion spread * apple crisp  The food was incredibly flavorful and unique. The mushroom soup and dumplings was the standout dish: it was like the definition of umami. We finished every last drop of that awesome soup and chewy dumplings.  Any kind of dumplings here are spectacular: the crisp pierogis (both kinds) were bursting with flavor and tender textures, and the potato dumplings were super hyyge (wrong region of Europe, I know - i just can't think of another way to put it).   And that apple crisp?! how the heck did they get it so flaky and crispy and buttery-tasting without adding any butter?  Apteka, can I teleport your restaurant to San Francisco?",

I found out about Apteka through Instagram in one way or another and mentioned it to my boyfriend, Thom, who said he knew about (but didn't know the name) because he worked with the owner and creator, Kate.  Anyway, I've been vegan/vegetarian for 27 years, and I'm so happy Pittsburgh now has a wonderful vegan restaurant that also has beer (because I love both.)  I had the Beet Borscht, and I thought it was incredibly delicious and refreshing. The accompanying bread with dill was wonderful, as well.  Thom had the Horse and Pepper, and I quote: \"This is a solid sandwich.\" He isn't vegan, so I sometimes have to drag him to the few vegan spots in the city.   We shared the large pierogi plate, which I thought I was going to consume on my own. Fantastic dish.   The ambiance is casual, personal, with pretty music.   I'm happy I can walk to this great new addition to Pittsburgh. Thanks!",

This place does not look like much from the outside but the interior is very relaxed, dimly lit and an intimate atmosphere for share plates and drinks I've never heard of. Instead of waiting in the line to be sat, we met someone pretty cool to share a table with that led to great conversation and a good night!  There was a live DJ at one of the tables playing some low-key background music but it was a nice touch.  But the real highlight of Apteka was the amazing food! Lots of good options and all delicious.

The ones that have garnered repeat visits basically only include two now defunct places in Brooklyn, and the kosher/vegetarian/Chinese joint where my centenarian grandmother hosts her birthday banquets.   This place is none of those. I know that because it's in Pittsburgh, and because my grandmother wasn't here when I walked in. So that's a lengthy and useless description of what Apteka is not. Sorry.   What Apteka actually is:  A Polish vegan place that doesn't cater to your inability to pronounce Polish vegan food.   For instance, you should probably order the seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem.  A Polish vegan place that serves interesting and tasty food.   Pierogies (what I said above), salatkas (salads), and anything else you might get will be high quality. I did personally think the potato pancakes were underseasoned and too dense, but no one is perfect.  A Polish vegan place with excellent and interesting cocktails.   There was grass in my drink, and I liked it. Not the kind of grass that your parents were into in the 60s but subsequently and hypocritically got mad about when they found it in your car. The grass that you find everywhere. And I liked it. And the other cocktails I had. And my meal, and the service, and the vibe.   So I'm adding this to the short list of vegetarian places that garner repeat visits.  Good work, Apteka.",

That's a vegan restaurant in rustic style, but unlike some vegan restaurants this one doesn't serve processed replacements of cheese and such. Instead they create their own recipes and achieve great combinations. Definitely, a unique place.",

First off it's AMAZING to have a vegan place that serves food so good my meat eating boyfriend raves about it. I mean the burgers and Pierogies are out of this world. Even if you eat meat this place should absolutely be on your must try list to visit at least once. But once you visit you'll be hooked!! My boyfriend and I each got a burger with fries and an order of Pierogies, everything came to around $44 which I thought was great. And worth every penny! The place has a relaxing and trendy vibe, we felt very welcomed. We will be back again and again!",

Over the summer they had grilled sunflower, which I'd never seen before but am so grateful to have been introduced to. Hopefully they'll bring it back this year!

I was blown away by the modern Polish take on food and apparently, so is the rest of Pittsburgh because the whole place was packed.  As you walk in, they have the menu on a the wall and you order at the register. The cocktails are a must! We coined them \"grown up juice\" because they're simply amazing drinks that happen to be alcoholic.    We ordered three plates to split and one Apple tarte to end with.  They recommended we order dessert in the beginning and once we finish dinner, tell the  server who collects the plates and they'll bring dessert out afterwards. Once you order, you find a table. They have a back room that looks like a converted one car garage, that adds a lot more seating. Once we got our food, we chowed down. Everything was delicious.

I've now tried the full list except for the gin (I'm allergic).  The vodka, black currant, vermouth, and burnt lemon cocktail is my favorite.  The service is excellent.  The decor is cool.  The prices are very reasonable.  The bathrooms are in a weird spot and a larger exterior sign would be nice, but it's totally worth a visit...or six.",

Come for the cocktails (I would recommend the vodka/black currant/vermouth/burnt lemon but I don't think you can go wrong), stay for the food. I have fairly high standards as a card-carrying Pittsburgh gal with Polish heritage, so I mean it when I say that the pierogi were absolutely fabulous. My coworker and I keep saying that we can't wait to go back!",

Well anyway the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. With all the food joints piping up in Pittsburgh it's not hard to notice that killer food, drinks, and service are preferred to those places that focus singularly on the mood lighting. So happy this place decided to turn all of their focus on putting together amazing dishes. The potatoes were my favorite and the drinks were interestingly light which both filled me up and started a good buzz. If you need a break from the exorbitant amount of steak, burgers, and salads with French fries then check this out.",

It's hard to make good vegan stuffed cabbage and pierogi but they have done it. The borscht is incredible; subtle yet full of flavor. The cocktails are also very good, they pair a lot of unique and offbeat flavors.  The ambiance is simple and inviting, the lighting is good and the space is enjoyable to be in. Large crowds gather on weekend nights so anticipate long lines at those times.  I love this place and will go back again and again.",

    "text": "Not a vegan but appreciate being vegan lite from time to time. In any event, my friends wife really wanted to try this and he asked if I wanted to meet up here. We had a table of 4 and noticed that upon arriving you order right away. We each ordered an item and a beverage and sat down towards to the back where they are building some outdoor seating! My drink was the (Vodka, black currant, vermouth, burnt lemon) which turned out to be very good. I had some food before I met up so I decided to try their Salatka z koperkiem which is a salad in case you were wondering (salad with sorrel, red mustard greens, shallot, apple, radish escabeche, and lots of dill). My friend got the Pierogi and he said it was amazing! Other drinks of the night included trying a glass of their Birch water which none of us had ever tried. It had a sweet taste but different than coconut water. Almost nutty flavored. It was also semi sweet. We all agreed that it was strangely good. My friend and I at that point decided to infuse it with vodka and other flavors at some point down the road. All in all, we had a good first experience and will be back again at some point.   Tl;Dr: Vegan cafe that boasts good, creative food with inspiring cocktails. They should have the runners pick up orders from existing customers so you don't have to go back and wait in line if you want another plate or cocktail.",

Its menu features potatoes in just about every form a potato can enter your meal, from pierogis to soup, from pancakes to, yes, even the salad had boiled potatoes in it. But it was all worthwhile, well-cooked, and worth the wait--and that's the only bummer here, there can indeed be quite a wait. No reservations for parties under six. You order from the counter, and then, when you get your food, you just have to hope there's space to sit. So go early, or late. It's crowded because it's so good.",

Our group had a wide range of tastes, and everyone LOVED APTEKA! The best option is to share a few of the entrees. The pierogies (especially the ones with smoked sweet potatoes), the endive, and the Kanapki were all hits with our side of the table. Thanks for hosting our group, APTEKA!",

Not an expert on it, but the menu had a heavy Polish influence. Started with a Pittsburgh fav - pierogis, but vegan style with greens, mushrooms and spices. Topped with a tangy sauce, scallions, and shredded beets. They were good and the price was fair. Endive with prunes and mushrooms was a tasty starter. Not something you'll find on other local menus. My favorite dish was the lentil stuffed cabbage in a zesty tomato sauce with crispy cabbage on the side. All dishes had a classic foundation with a vegan and crafty touch. Topped off the meal with a bourbon, plum, and sage cocktail. Not as strong as is like but tasty. Will come back again, especially for the Golabkis!",

The reason that I can't give this restaurant a 5-star rating, however, is because of its service, or lack thereof.  This is a gourmet restaurant with a service model based on McDonald's.  Thus, you must wait in line to order all of your food and beverages before you even sit down.  If you later want another drink, you must get up and go to the bar to get another.  You are forced to learn the menu on your feet and order quickly lest you anger the folks behind you.  My wife and I were really put off by this and almost walked out before getting to the one and only cashier to order.  (At least McDonald's has multiple cashiers.) Given that they do have servers, this all seemed so unnecessary and merely contemptuous of the customers.",

    "text": "Have to admit, the vegan scene here in Pittsburgh is really starting to mature and to come off the ground. It's really quite nice to be a part of such a healthy food movement that's been taking the city by craze & Apteka is no different. A vegan establishment in the Bloomfield area near Children's, this is a great place to go for some great tasting vegan food, snacks, drinks, and a good time at the bar (if that's your thing lol). Tried the Kartofle z jogurtem (a Polish-inspired yogurt appetizer) and I was surprised at the rather novel but delightful combination of sweet & savory with the potato & apple in the same dish. The yogurt smoothed both flavors out & made things interesting. However, I would really write home about the pierogis, which are absolutely bomb here. The dish has a combo of sauerkraut + mushroom along with celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish pierogis, but I'd have to say that the sauerkraut + mushroom is the better of the two, though both are equally great-tasting (only my preference, take my opinion with a grain of salt). There are also lots of alcohol choices available at the bar (wine & beer). Don't be afraid to ask the bartenders what you're looking for in your drink as they are quite knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to help. In general, a lovely addition of a restaurant to Bloomfield. Would highly recommend a visit.",

    "text": "I love settling in at a restaurant for a nice meal, but sometimes I want awesome food (and Apteka's dishes with brilliant flavors are certainly that) but I'm short on time. Many people have kids, after-work commitments, a dog in the car, whatever, but still want delicious vegan food, in a city that doesn't have a ton of vegan options.  At most restaurants, there's a thing called \"take out\" - novel concept, I know - where you can call ahead and pick up your order. Apteka disallows this. You can place a takeout order, but only if you're physically present at Apteka. Which means you're waiting around the restaurant while they prepare your meal. Worse, they're absolute jerks about it.  Sure, some upscale restaurants don't do takeout orders. But Apteka isn't that. It's a bunch of hipsters (I say that lovingly because I probably am one) standing around in torn-up hoodies.  I liked the food, for sure, but the snippy staff and unwelcoming policies have to go. This is exactly why non-vegans hate trying vegan places.",

    "text": "This is a great restaurant whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not..period. The only ones I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to would be picky eaters who like to stick with familiar flavors and textures. I absolutely loved the two cocktails I tried (tequila+wildflower+citrus and rum+juniper+draai laag)... way better than some fancier and more expensive restaurants I've reviewed. And the food.. oh my.. I had the Boczniaki z kapusta which is oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb and a small Zimowa salad which had porcini vin + pickled beet + roast turnip + pea shoots + mint toast. I must confess, nothing was familiar about the flavors and the textures and their combination. Even the greens in the salad were unique and not the kind you'd see in the average salad. But the melange was outstanding. I'd strongly recommend the salad. I was full by then but couldn't not try the pierogies. And that ended up being the best decision I took that day. Just look at the list of what goes into the pierogies - Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Not you're average joe pierogi for sure! Do not miss trying them. The only thing that was slightly annoying was that the ordering is cafe style..and that ends up being a bottleneck. I made the mistake of ordering my first drink.. then had to go back to stand in line to order my appetizer.. and then again for my second drink and entre.. and then AGAIN for the afterthought pierogi! The fact that the menu is full of lovely, exotic and unpronounceable dishes/ingredients and so everyone has several questions before ordering and contributes to the bottleneck in the line. So you might want to consider pulling up the menu on your phone (because the only copy is taped to the bar counter) and ordering all your food and drinks at once when you get to the counter. Slightly inconvenient.. but saves you the awkwardness of waiting in line for 15 minutes to order your next drink while your date is waiting at the table. But line or not, I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Yup. Loved it.  Went with my meat-loving bf (I'm a vegetarian) and he loved it as well.  We got the Kanapki (favorite) and the Cykoria (also good but not nearly as good as the Kanapki).  The Salatka (the only salad on the menu) was the only item we considered not worth it, because it was just a salad of mixed greens with what appeared to be a few pieces of pickled potatoes.  The menu said it had shallots and apple but the dish we got didn't have those (unless that was like infused into the dressing or something?) also the salad's dressing was so spicy that we couldn't really eat it, I'm huge on spice but that amount of spice just concentrated on mixed greens wasn't great.  We also got the pierogies which were amazing.  My boyfriend got a cocktail with tequila and citrus and he loved it, I tried it as well and thought it was awesome.   Overall would highly recommend to meat eaters and vegs alike, with the particular standouts of the meal being the Kanapki and the pierogies.  The only disappointment was the Salatka which I would not recommend due to the spice as well as the disappointing lack of ingredients considering it is nearly the same price as other much more complicated and hearty items on the menu.  Will definitely return.    Ambiance is chill and casual cool.  Wait staff was very nice and attentive.  You order your food and then get a number and sit wherever you want and then the food comes to you that way, you don't have like a waiter to yourself.  This wasn't a problem and actually I liked it.",

If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, stopping here is a must. I had the 7 pierogi plate, Kanapki, and their special Yogurt Rhubarb. The three tartines were an amazing start, my favorite being the red pepper and tomato one (and tomatoes are my second least favorite vegetable!). The pierogies were for a fact the best food I've had to date. A nutty granola crunch, rosetip dust, and yogurt sauce topped two varieties of pierogies: potato apple, and my favorite, mushroom and sauerkraut. I absolutely HATE mushrooms and sauerkraut, but these pierogies were for a fact the best food I have EVER eaten. It's hard to make a pierogi feel light, but they did a wonderful job at it. Ended with the yogurt Rhubarb for a semi-dessert. I could have that for breakfast everyday.  The restaurant was a little packed by the door where you order, but the aromas and open \"backyard\" seating make up for it entirely. If you're considering eating here, DO IT!",

The mushroom is my favorite of the two options (other is cabbage and potato). There is use of dill, so keep that in mind. It comes with a bit of cucumber and beets.  My go to is the boczniaki z kapusta because I love mushrooms. I've had it before, but on this occasion the rye was burnt on one side. Bummer. The oyster mushrooms were good and quite filling. Hubs got the special sandwich and ate every last bite.  The line to order is the bottleneck. There is one person taking orders because it's an order and sit spot. Not a problem, but the menu on the wall is difficult to read since it's vertical and you might not be able to read the bottom. Menus are also on the counter, not so helpful to those in the back of the line.  Overall, cute place, with fun vibe. There is a full bar, so that's a bonus. I'm very much a can do without meat kind of person whereas hubs doesn't get that. He suggested we go here. That's how legit it is.",

Whoever had the \"brilliant\" idea of having one cashier to place all orders at what should be a regular restaurant with servers is crazy. It's not working!  I was the second customer and had never been to the restaurant. The cashier was so rude when I asked if we could sit. The place was also so smoky; it was not pleasant at all. The music is strange, and I like a lot of experimental music, but I don't want to feel like I'm listening to the weirdest Bjork tracks while eating dinner. It just doesn't go together. Other than the cashier's attitude, the music, and the smoke (which was seriously obnoxious) the pierogis, salad, sandwich and cocktail were delicious.",

The Baba jaga and the pierogis were both a little odd. The flavor was very vinegar-y and acidic. We weren't too fond of the pierogi fillings either.

We got the Kanapki, Placki ziemniaczane z papryka (potato pancakes), Pierogies (7), and Kluski Slaskie (potatoes dumplings). I also got the Becherovka, house tonic, & burnt lemon cocktail.   The cocktail was served first and was very refreshing and a perfect blend of everything. It went perfectly with the various flavors of the dishes we all shared together. They said this was the most popular drink on the menu.   The Kanapki had flavorful spreads (tartines) however the House seed bread was extremely difficult to cut/break--especially if another person wanted a bite.   The potato pancakes were my second favorite! Extremely delicious and flavorful. The spiced/marinated/grilled veggies on the side were delicious. Definitely recommend this one.  The Pierogies were definitely my favorites. However we got 6 mushroom/sauerkraut pierogies and only 1 cabbage/potato pierogie so I didn't get to try the cabbage/potato one. The beets and cucumber + sauce that came with it was awesome though.   Finally, the potato dumplings were alright. The texture was cool and appealing but the sauce that came with it tasted kind of burned and wasn't very pleasing. I wish the sauce was seasoned slightly more to give it some more flavor  Overall, the place was great. After ordering our food and drinks we received our order within less than 10 minutes! Amazing. The ambiance was very cute and casual. I went on a Wednesday night and there was only one table left (which I took with my friends) when we got there at 7:45pm. Definitely s popular spot and well worth the price.",

    "text": "I don't get who thought reinventing the wheel on how food is ordered and received was needed. We came on a Saturday night past 8pm with a group of 4. We waited in a line that was to the door for 15 minutes or so. Once we got to the cashier we were encouraged to get food to go instead of dining in as the wait would be 40 min and people didn't seem like leaving (I wouldn't either after knowing the hurdles these people went through just to order food). Disclaimer: we were fine with a wait, we expected one but didn't expect to be met with such passive aggressive attitude that new customers didn't understand how ordering works at this special restaurant.  It perplexed me that our options were to either order take out (for a group of 4?) or get a number to WAIT again at the bar area just to order your food and claim a table then WAIT again for your food. If you decide to fate your luck on waiting instead of take out then you must stay in the bar area (which had 15 people already crowding around - there was no place for us to stand so we got corralled like cattle to the corner near the front door with water carafes and glasses but no place to set them on?).   It feels like they make the ordering process as onerous as possible to mask the fact that they are a busy restaurant with limited staff. As you can see from reviews here, they haven't addressed this ongoing problem.  Truly disappointed as I've been following the owners ever since the pierogi nights at the Stephen foster center and was so excited to eat here after moving back to Pittsburgh. At least the food is wonderful once you get it but maybe it tastes better after fighting through the system.",

    "text": "We had high hopes for Apteka, but ended up walking away dissapointed. Their ordering method is wonky; you wait in line, place your order, get a number, then wait for a table to eventually clear up. Our party of four was strongly pushed to order out instead of waiting for a table, as the front staff assured us there were several reservations and groups ahead of us, and it would be 30-40 minutes ~ up to an hour wait before we got seated. We reluctantly agreed, and found a couple of seats at the bar we could sit at while we waited.  We were immediately told that we could not sit at the bar, as that was for \"sit down and waiting customers only\" and that we would have to wait in the corner by the front door (no seats or tables to be had).  Strike one.  The place cleared out pretty quickly and we noticed several tables opening up. We asked if we could change from \"take out\" to \"sit down\" and the mnager was called out. While friendly, it seemed like we were asking for something incredibly exceptional at this point, despite showing zero animosity towards anyone there.   During this time, several people walked in from the street, skipped the line at the counter, and sat down at the bar without anyone questioning them (how a bar should work), which irked us a bit, as we were JUST told we were not allowed to at the bar.  Strike two.  We got our table (keeping in mind we had already paid for the food at this point) and some of our party wanted to get drinks so they headed up to the bar. They were then told that the drinks have to be on the original order, and to order drinks they would have to go back through the main line (10~15 minutes of waiting), order the drinks again, and they would be brought over with the food. They made another \"exception\" for what should be a standard process (go to the bar, order a drink, pay for drink/start a tab) and we noted that we were not made aware of this when we originally ordered food, else we would have ordered some drinks (probably because we were getting pushed out the door with \"take out\" for no reason).  Strike three.  Food finally comes out and it is exceptionally good (per my group's reviews of the food) hence a 2 star instead of a 1 star review. However, we were missing my meal (plate of pierogies) and I was unable to eat anything else that was ordered due to a recent medical procedure. I had specifically asked for those pierogies to be with the nut-free option (and they had already been paid for way back when this misadventure first started). The bigger issue was that despite seating others (even around us), our server (the manager we spoke to earlier) completely ignored every time we tried to flag us down. There was no check up on us, no asking how the food was, nothing. I ended up eating nothing at all while there, and was debating if it was even worth the time tracking down the manager and asking for a refund for the food we never got. We eventually did on the way out, and that was that.  Strike four.  Apteka really perplexes me; we were not rude, snide, or otherwise deserving of the treatment we got, but some we were treated like we were not wanted there at all. Ironically, there were always a few empty tables in the place after we were seated, and I just found out that their reservations are for parties of 6 or more (we had a group of 4), so it shouldn't have interfered with our seating to begin with. Overall, the very confusing and poor service overshadows what should have been a great experience for myself, my wife, and an out-of-town couple visiting us (including one completely new to Pittsburgh; what a great experience for him!).   I will definitely not be going back.",

As we were waiting, we witnessed a number of tables complaining: one still had not even received water,  another was wondering where there food was, and another was awkwardly giving the waiter the stink eye as he took quite a bit of time that we were there to clean up what I assume was a water spill: the tables were so tight that I guess that made it rather difficult. Everyone around us was in a bad mood and literally no one in sight had food, so halfway through our wait,  we both decided it was stupid to wait in line for so long for what looked like a pretty miserable experience.",

We waited maybe 30 minutes or more for seats but we are happy with the delicious cocktail and mocktails they had to offer while we waited. I would def recommend preparing for a wait if you want to eat at standard dinner time on the weekend. The wait for our food once we were seated wasn't too bad maybe around an additional 10 minutes. We ordered varied dishes, peirogies, dill soup, salad, the bread and spreads dish, and a couple other items. To me the winner was the dill soup! It was so good I would go back just for that. I wasn't a fan of the vegan bread - the other food didn't taste vegan but that heavy dirt like bread definitely did. I love having another vegan restaurant in the burgh and hope it only continues to thrive!",

We arrived there and the first thing they say is the the kitchen folks are taking a break so we could not order for another 20 mins.  Okay, so we went to sit down and wait till it is time.  We proceeded to order:  Bababurger and fries.  Presentation-wise, looked good.  The bread was extremely dense and was hard to bite through.  We had a hard time cutting it in half with a knife for sharing.  The patty had next to no flavor and the texture was odd when eaten with the hard bread.    Perogies plate (spicy) - this was better than the bababurger but all you could taste is spice and overwhelms the different stuffings for each one.  The only highlight of the night were the fries as they tasted freshly cut and fried.  However, halfway through we got tired of it; maybe due to our palates being numbed from the food aforementioned.    Afterwards, we felt really bloated throughout the night going into the next day.  It was quite an uncomfortable feeling and for that reason, there will not be a return visit here.",

I like to think I'm a hip person who frequents gallery crawls and drinks red wine and decorates my house with tons of plants, but this was truly the most millennial thing I've ever done. And I thought I was super millennial.   You walk in, are fronted with a huge wall menu, place your order, and sit. Anyone who has ever been to Gaucho (which def isn't Vegan) it's a very similar set up. That's cool I don't mind that. I've also have vegan food from other vegan restaurants and really enjoyed it (no I'm not vegan).   We sat in the back room which I didn't realize was like a garage area till after, when I started to freeze. It was so cold in there. I did enjoy the vibe and happiness around and ambience with the lighting.   The food: I ordered the pierogies and the potato pancakes. The potato pancakes were ok, but they were cold. Maybe they were supposed to be? The pierogies were good but I'm sorry I really don't think they're as amazing as everyone says they are. I liked the sauces and relishes with the dishes more than the actual dish.   Maybe I'll be back? I kinda want this 5 star restaurant that everyone else is saying it is.",

I mean, it's wonderful if you're vegan/veg but, if you're not, this place is still one of the best joints in the 'Burgh for yummy Eastern-Euro-style fare!   Came here last night for the 3rd time with my gal-pal group, so I got to sample a wide variety of the menu. First, the cocktails are so affordable and amazing! The Becherovka cocktail is one of the best drinks I've had this year - it's spicy with a bit of sweetness (not too much) and beyond delicious! Their homemade sodas in flavors like black pepper and oat straw are also out of this world.  We started with the 3 tartines, salatka 1, and a sampling of pierogi, all of which hit the spot. I love their pierogi - they're fully stuffed, no skimping, and cooked to perfection with savory sauces that are always yummy. For the main, I chose the Kotlet Selerowy - a vegetable schnitzel (basically, a fried veg pattie) with beet, cabbage, and cucumber salads, buckwheat, and horseradish sauce - and every element was delicious and refreshing. One friend ordered the Kluski Slaskie which is basically a potato dumpling dish with fried buckwheat and a lima bean puree - it was so good that I'm going back next week for an order!   Great food and drink. Great atmosphere. Great service. Affordable. What's not to like?",

From the moment you arrive and smell the flavors and hear the crowds, you know you are in for a culinary treat.  Diners start by ordering at the counter. It may take some time to navigate the menu as the names are all crazy. Take the time to read them all or just ask some questions as all options are delicious. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and seemed to be having a blast working here.  The food highlight was the pierogi platter ($11). It was very great to try different varieties and flavors on one plate. The kanapki ($6) were great and are also offered on a rotating basis of delicious flavors. The carrot puree was my favorite. After eating delicious comfort food, don't forget to save room for dessert as they offer some great options. The apple tart ($5) was sweet and sour and savory all in one and I would definitely recommend it.  Overall, I really appreciated how this meatless restaurant was able to flaunt that fact with interesting flavor combinations. I don't want to eat meat at a restaurant like this and I'm glad they don't fill their menu with meat substitutes. Embrace the veggies and grains.

The pierogies are amazing (so glad they serve them in two different size portions), and the cabbage rolls were great with a killer, memorable tomato sauce.  The entree salad (can't remember the name) was unique because of the bitter, spicy greens.    I'm really looking forward to trying the sandwiches soon.    A wine option or two wouldn't go amiss.

    "text": "Probably the tastiest vegan food in Pittsburgh. Pierogi were the obvious highlight, the smoked potato and parsnip being especially noteworthy. We also got a giant salad full of herbs and baby kale with tasty homemade bread on the side. The food is seasoned so well you do not miss the butter!   Only drawback was the difficulty in reading the menu, which is posted pretty close to the door. A few paper copies to pick and read while you wait in line to order would be helpful.",

I would go as far to say that it's the best food I've had in Pittsburgh in the last couple of years. I could eat here everyday, seriously. The kanapki's are perfect little bites of vegan heaven. The carrot pate is out of this world and the homemade bread is killer! The pierogi are perfection. I've also sampled the potatoes and the salatka. The salad has a ton of fresh sorrel and dill with a nice sweet vinaigrette which I liked immensely with the addition of a little sea salt.  The drinks are yummy and reasonably priced. Birch water is the best non-alcoholic beverage ever! The cherry kihafa and lime is a good cocktail, not super strong but sweet and sour goodness. I had another vodka drink with burnt lemon sometimes else the first time I visited and it's lovely as well.  Sitting at the bar is really nice but the tables are fine and staff comes around and checks in even though you don't really have an actually server, it's more of a fast-casual set up but you can keep a tab open for drinks and extras. The place is modern yet a little homey, very comfortable and not overly done. The  only thing I don't care for is the heavy use of mass incense but it came and went.   This place is must-try. I look forward to going here as often as possible.",

The salad has an intense bite to the dressing. The vegan pierogies were tasty, and the red crumbled whatever that came with it added a slightly spicy bite; this was the top of an overall excellent meal. The special sandwich was tasty too although a logistical nightmare for sharing.  Staff was helpful, bringing glasses and extra plates when it became clear we were sharing everything.  I didn't try the soup. One member of our party had it and thought it was just okay.  Fast casual - you order and pay at the counter.   Place is on the loud side.  Restrooms are openly transgender and non-binary friendly. The doors each have a sign saying only what fixtures are in each bathroom.  Definitely worth a trip across the city.",

I am over the moon with this menu. Love that they offer small and big plates as well as fantastic cocktails. And the black pepper soda, you guys, OMG. I need that bottled for home: it's so good. Went with friends and had tartine and pierogis. I'm a meat eater but can throw down on some good vegan. The food is absolutely divine. The vodka black currant and rum plum wine juniper cocktails are so refreshing and appealing. Just a quick walk from home, I'll definitely be a regular. This is one of those spots we'd walk by anxiously awaiting their opening. Wow it was worth the wait!",

When we there on a Sunday evening, it was slow enough that we didn't have any problems with the ordering system. We are from Denver and have a couple of restaurant/bars that have this system so it was no problem.   We ended up taking some cake to-go, and it was good. The cake itself was a little dry and more like a bread or muffin, and I wasn't a huge fan of the raspberry and cream toppings. I did enjoy it, but don't think I would order it again.

    "text": "Na zdrowia, to the chefs for taking the flavors and textures of traditional Polish food to the vegan palate. As someone who was an expat in Poland for two years, I was spoiled by many home cooked Polish meals that featured fresh herbs from markets, home pickled vegetables, homemade soups, foraged mushrooms, fermented vegetables, and, of course, hearty meats and sausages. Now, I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but Apteka pulls the flavor combinations from the best meals I had and delivers sans meat. I would go to Apteka over any other restaurants in Pittsburgh that features fatty and over-salted kielbasa and bland pierogies resembling Polish food in form only. Apteka delivers the flavors and textures better.  Take the the Polish-vegan version, kotlet selerowy, or celery root cutlet. Apteka's version of Polish schnitzel has the same crunchy, breaded coating and tender but still toothsome inside as the best pork and veal cutlets I dream of.   The cabbage and mushroom pierogies capture the sour, umami combination of the best versions I had in Poland.  Now a couple of the dishes like the Chlodnik, a cold beet soup, were a little off the mark style wise. It was a little too think and heavy. I sensed a bit of disappointment from My Polish friend at the  table, but I enjoyed the flavor.  The one thing I am perplexed by is the recreation of the Soviet-era, milk bar experience as you enter. Diners are greeted by a long line in front of one cashier who takes you order before you sit down. We easily waited 20 minutes in line to order. After that, things went more smoothly. A tip to newcomers: leave the tab open so you can quickly order more drinks or dessert at the bar without getting in line again. Work out this kink, Apteka, and you'll be close to perfect.",

The person taking our order was very patient as we asked him questions about our choices and gave us excellent suggestions--which made the whole experience so much more enjoyable.   I got the Special Sandwich which had a delicious smoky flavor to it and an excellent savory sauce to pair with the cabbage slaw and veggies inside. Highly recommend!!!

Anyways who cares about that stuff. What matters is the food.  Had the eggplant sandwich and the spicy perogies.  Both were fantastic no-compromise-on-flavor.  Super savory and fresh and delicious.

But what turned me off is the customer service. Most of the employees were not very pleasant. You could tell they were just waiting to get off. One in particularly was rude to me when I asked to sit outside. She said she would clean the table off then let me know when it's ready while I sat inside. I asked here a few minutes later if it was ready and she said... \"ohh yeah someone sat there already\" to which I replied with, \" ok I thought you told me you'd let me know when it's ready\" and she rudely expressed her annoyance when saying that she never said that. Maybe I did mis hear her, but she still played a great role in losing my good experience. Overall, food was good, but more attention needs to be focused on the employees attitude.",

That tells you how good it is, and how easy it is to eat and enjoy vegan food. Absolutely nothing is lacking. Drinks are also fantastic and I love their selection of Euro wines.

    "text": "Unlike anything else in Pittsburgh! From the minute you arrive until you leave this place will blow you away.  Upon arrival you stop to order at what appears to be the bar area. It's kind of Smallman Galley (ish) where you order and pay at the counter before choosing your own seat with a table number. You can review the menu before arriving, but honestly the hostess did such a fabulous job explaining everything just go with it. The line never went down and even with people breathing down our backs to order the hostess never made us feel rushed. She was so sweet and took care in making recommendations and explaining our best choices to cater to my nut allergy.   Per the recommendations we ordered three items: Boczniaki z kapusta, the Perogi and the Kluski Slaskie. We also each had a drink. Marissa had the Becherovka, house tonic & burnt lemon and I had the Fernet, scotch, apple cider. I took one look at the drink menu and had no idea what to order so I let the staff pick for me! I am in no way a scotch drinker, but I loved this drink! I was still skeptical when it arrived at the table I wasn't sure what to expect. It was incredible. One of my favorite drinks in Pittsburgh. Go out on a limb and try it!   We waited no time at all for our order. I'd be surprised to say it took even 15 minutes. The dishes are presented beautifully. We split all three items and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The Boczniaki z kapusta was by far my favorite dish. The mushrooms are roasted perfectly and the butternut sauce tops if off. The Klushi Slaskie dumplings are a bit flavorless on their own. With the help of the sauce they are magical.   If you are planning your visit be sure to ask for recommendations. The staff is super knowledgeable and kind. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "If you had told me that the best meal I would eat of late would be a  Vegan Polish one I would not have believed you, I may even have said 'no way!'. But here I am eating a slice of humble pie because my recent dinner at Apteka was outstandingly good! I'm guessing that this space was previously a garage or workshop of some kind because it is a pretty bare concrete space, but there's a nice atmosphere and on a recent busy night but felt warm and inviting.  I was a little confused when we went in, so if you're an Apteka newbie, here's what you do. There's a menu on the wall, decide what you want, order at the cash register as if you were at a bar, and then go and grab a table and your food and drinks will be brought to you. Just like at a bar you can leave your tab open (for drinks, dessert etc) or close it. There's a full bar with an interesting selection of craft beers and organic wines and some inventive cocktails. Once ordered our food and drinks arrived swiftly. Portions are generous and the food is as delicious as it is unique. The Pierogis are excellent, we loved the two salads we tried, the bread served with the Mushroom Pate and Pickle Plate was so darn good we took some back to our hotel and had it for breakfast, and the Celeriac Schnitzel was a revelation that we have already cooked and enjoyed at home. We were pretty full after having eaten our vegan feast (two words I never thought I would write together!) but we split a Poppyseed Cake and Apricot Compote which was very good and I had a digestif cocktail of Fernet, Scotch and Apple Cider which was terrific, very well balanced. I know it's only vegetables but I think Apteka offers exceptional value for money, alongside a unique dining experience. I highly recommend it!",

But don't worry everything is just so good, even for non-vegans. Definitely some of the most memorable food I've had, with so many fun spices and sauces.  Went with a party of five, a few of whom typically like meat, and we all loved the food. We got a bunch of different plates and shared everything. Pictures below include pierogis (seven of them, a few with a delicious smoked mushroom filling), potato pancake (smaller appetizer, nice and dense texture), burnt carrot salad (the burnt carrot looks like char on the outside of the bowl but tastes like flavorful hummus), special sandwich (veggie pate which had lots of beet in it), and potato dumplings in a Lima bean puree (with big cooked leafy greens). I wish I could have taken pictures of our other dishes because everything looked so unique and tasty.  Service was quick and no frills--they basically just bring your food and let you eat. You order at a counter bar style. One thing to note is that when it's crowded the line tends to go out the door. Also, the front room is nice and air conditioned but the back seating area is much warmer and humid in the summer. So try to get there early and get a seat in the front.",

The endive and beech & oyster mushrooms were good but I would have rather gotten a lot less pickled prune, a little more thyme oil and a piece of bread.  Speaking of bread, the slice that came with the Golabki was great and actually would have liked a little more to dip into the roast tomato sauce.

I've tried several things on their ever-changing menu, and nothing has disappointed. The cocktails are always a pleasant surprise. I will say, though, I once ordered a whiskey sour without thinking about the egg involved, which makes it off-limits at a vegan bar (they were very kind to make an effort to substitute something, though).",

I came here with a friend who was visiting and was excited to try vegan central/eastern European food. We split the kanapki - which were each very good but I have to say the standout one was definitely the carrot pate.   For our meals, I had the pierogies. These were really good although I wish the different flavors were more distinct. Either way, each of them came out hot and flavorful. My friend had the Horse and Pepper which she raved about!  The drinks were good here too and all priced below $10!  If I had to pick a must-try, it would have to be the carrot pate kanapki. All in all, this place is definitely worth checking out!",

The only ones I recall is perogies and salad, I also remember killing my low carb diet by eating the sliced bread.  The drinks are very tasty but a little in the upper end in cost.  I didn't know what to expect, to be honest. But I was attracted by the small and vegan menu.  I tried so hard getting the recipe for the salad dressing from the friendly staff. No luck, but I have ideas.  Will definitely go back next time I get a loan for the drinks.",

We stood in the doorway for a while and nothing happened and then went up to the counter as a line formed behind us. The girl taking orders was just as confused as us and asked us what we wanted but we were trying to get a table and she just took the next person in line instead of giving us a number. She must have been brand new. So we went to the back of the line and waited again. We ordered, paid, and realized that there were no seats! We walked over to the bar and a couple happened to be getting up, so we sat down. They never took away the drinks and checks from the previous couple. We got our food pretty soon after we ordered, both appetizers and main courses at once. The food was very bitter to the point where it was actually spicy and burning my mouth. We packaged it up and left soon after we started eating. It tasted better in the car, but I was really disappointed as a whole with the experience.",

    "text": "I am in complete disbelief that such a great, unusual new restaurant has opened in Bloomfield. When a friend and I checked it out, we were VERY hungry, and had somewhat low expectations (sign looked a bit sketchy out front, we weren't sure if we even liked eastern European food). I could not have been more wrong! The interior has a hip, grungy vibe, that is reminiscent of the old country - a little eastern soviet blockade feel to it. The servers and bartenders are so cool, and if you're lucky, take a moment to chat with them.   The concept is pretty cool - you order at the bar, cafeteria style, then pick a table. They bring you your drinks and food. The drinks are magnificent and the pricing is excellent for Pittsburgh (average drinks $6-9). I ordered a gin drink with citrus and celery salt which is now my favorite gin drink of all time. My buddy ordered a campari and vodka based concoction that was not too sweet, but tasted of freshly juiced black cherries.  We ordered the large plate of pierogies and the trio of open faced tartines. The bread on the open faced sandwiches was dark and crusty, clearly home-made, and reminded me inescapably of happy childhood days baking dark bread with my family. The toppings were great - one had chopped seasoned root vegetables, one was some sort of tapenade, and the final one was pickled radishes and cucumbers over another tomato tapenade. Each one was unique and delicious. Then came the pierogies. Utter. Perfection. They were fried, which gave the nicest crunch when you bit in. There are two types they make - sauerkraut and mushroom (a little spicy with pepper), and potato. Both were incredible, and had layers of flavor that made me want to order three more plates. Honestly, I would have never even known it was a vegan restaurant if I hadn't looked it up ahead of time. I never missed meat once, and barely noticed there was none present.   After all of this food, we sadly didn't have any appetite for dessert. However, I am confident I'll be back. And soon! This place is heating up and I can only imagine that the sky will be the limit for them.   Two pierogie covered thumbs up!",

The staff was friendly and helpful. They have a full bar and a selection of local beers (shout out to roundabout brewery).  The menu is small, which I like. We had the tartines, the salad, and the large order of pierogis. The salad and pierogis were delicious! The pierogis were simultaneously doughy and crispy and the filling was a yum twist on the traditional potato and cheese. The tartines were good but I will probably try something else next time and there will be definitely be a next time.  Just a side note- my husband and I cAme here early .. Like 5pm. Not sure how kid friendly it would be much later. They didn't have high chairs.",

    "text": "My partner and I went to Apteka on a Saturday night. It was about 8:00pm and there was a line out the door, which moved relatively quickly. The menu is posted on the wall as you enter and you order everything (drinks and food) at the counter when you walk in. You can choose to leave your check open or close it right then. From there, you take a number and find an open table. Being 8:00pm on a Saturday, it was pretty packed and we came pretty close to having our food arrive before a table opened up, but it worked out after all.   For drinks: - vodka  - whiskey/fernet  - gin/celery - whiskey/prune  Verdict -- All of the drinks were REALLY good except the whiskey/prune drink. It tasted like a flat jack and coke and the prune juice was more like syrup at the bottom. No bueno.  For food, we shared: - kanapki - pierogi - horse & pepper sandwich  Verdict -- Kanapki were very good and each were unique. Both of the pierogi were really good. The horse & pepper sandwich was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. I'd rather try the other good looking dishes they had!  Overall, I would highly recommend giving this place a shot. I think the creative dishes would leave even the most devout carnivores satisfied. My one real gripe is how the restaurant is set up. I get that they want to have a relaxed vibe by having you order and pay for everything at the front, but if you want to order more drinks or to close your tab, you have to get back in line (which can be long depending on when you go) to do so. I would think having the servers handle additional drink orders and the check at your table would have been a better set up, but maybe I'm wrong.",

    "text": "SO OVERRATED!   Okay, so I will stop shouting now. But seriously, I am missing out on what the thing is about this place. I am a vegetarian and looked forward to eating here, but the food and ambience both disappointed.  I had Kartofle and a Special Sandwich. The Kartofle was potatoes with lingonberries and some yogurt. It was fine, nothing special, a side dish that became my main course because...  The Special Sandwich was \"special\" in the way that means \"not good\". I think they were going for crusty baguette for the bread, but it was tooth-breaking levels of hard. Look, I bake bread, I know the difference between crusty and hard, and this was just hard, like it was stale or something. And the filling was bland and heavy, no discernible flavor.  I don't understand why they don't just have table service like every other restaurant in their price range. You come in and have to wait in a line that hits the door, so you're immediately not comfortable, you give your order to a person, and then you hope you find a seat, and maybe you don't sometimes? I was there on a Sunday so I didn't have an issue. We sat in the carport, which had appallingly bright lighting. Our table was sticky. We tried to clean it with water, but that didn't help. The benches were uncomfortable. It's like they want you to eat and leave fast (though nobody rushed us out; just the ambience screamed \"GET OUT OF HERE FAST\").  That said, my cocktail was just fine and the staff seemed friendly and efficient.",

We got the pierogies to split, and she got a beet sandwich and I got the salad.   The salad was great, spicier than I thought it would be (but fine by me), and just super flavorful. The pierogies didn't disappoint either, especially the smoked potato. I was actually a big fan of paying first and then finding a table, because we were trying to make it somewhere else quickly afterwards and it was nice to be able to just get up and go when we were finished.

So we decided then that we would have to come back for dinner one of these nights, and tonight was the night! We ordered the special sandwich, the perogies and the second salad on the menu (can't remember the name but it had a 2 next to it.) Going into the night I was most excited about the perogies, but truthfully the special sandwich and the second salad stole the show! I love the type of bread that the sandwich is served on, and the yumminess inside of the sandwich had a perfect kick of spice to the flavor I will absolutely be ordering again. The salad had an amazing dill type dressing which made it so tasty! The perogies were still impressive and they had a nice crispiness to them :) we skipped out on dessert this time though since we ordered so much food; next time though :)   Updated: absolutely in love with this place my boyfriend and I come here EVERY weekend and for over a year now! My go to is the klasyk burger and fries, my boyfriends is still the special sandwich and perogies! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",

They've a large and I imagine knowledgeable staff, but their counter-side ordering approach of all courses and drinks at once seems to take advantage of neither. The result is mostly a long queue and then food / drink being delivered without much explanation or a reference point (and all at once).   I'd like to go back and see it all again, and see how often the menu changes. It was good but I'd very much like to see a change in their service approach.   Just my preference, though, for non-byob establishments.",

There was no room to stand either, we were basically on top of and bumping people who were already seated and eating.  At busy times, you are in a competition with other patrons for a table.  People hover around tables that they think will leave soon.  There were people who's food came out of the kitchen before they secured a table.  It was such a nightmare for the people eating and the people waiting.  On busy nights, I also think they must fry up the perogies in advance because they come soggy and slightly cold instead of hot and crisp.    I adore the food and decor but would only come again during off peak hours.",

I have no complaints about their food. Each item tasted fresh, all the ingredients balanced each other well, and I would order each item again. My gin cocktail was equally delicious. I sipped it slowly not to take away from experiencing each flavor of my meal. This drink was so well crafted I found myself saying it is one of the best cocktails I've ever ordered between places in other US states and countries where I have dined.   I plan to return and am hoping for the same experience. My friends have eaten here a couple times and commented to me saying each time they have been delightfully pleased.   Last but not least, service was prompt and professional. Even though you order at the counter, it doesn't take away from having your food and drinks brought to your table in a timely manner and their servers remembering to check on you.",

The ordering line is located right in front of the entrance, so this might be inconvenient when it's super busy. The cashier explained how seating, ordering extra food, paying the bill, etc. works without us even asking. To reiterate what others have said, you take your number to where you want to sit, if you want to order an extra drink/food you can order at the bar or ask one of the servers when they walk around. The bathroom is locates behind a curtain right after the bar. I really liked the simple, clean aesthetic, and when it gets darker, the tables are backlit with lighting by the floor which created a nice atmosphere.  The food came out quickly, and we had ordered a large plate of pierogies, kanapki, and Piernik dessert (the perfect amount for 2 people to split). The pepper soda was also delicious-slightly sweet with a peppery aftertaste. We both were really pleased with the variety of flavors and portions and completely full at the end of the meal. I wasn't blown away by the food, but I think it's something unique in Pittsburgh. I'm interested in trying their other offerings, but I think you could pass on the piernik. It was good but not great. All in all, a really solid vegan restaurant that I think most people will enjoy.",

    "text": "Once again I'm venturing off into the world of vegan dining! Apteka definitely met all of my expectations and then some with their Eastern European flare and food that was filled with flavor!  My friend and I decided to order two small plates and then an order of pierogis to share.  As a first timer I wanted to try everything on the menu, which admittedly took some time to decipher.  The pierogies were outrageously delicious...and Pittsburghers beware...these are NOT Mrs. T's...consider your pierogi game upgraded when you leave Apteka!  Filled with sauerkraut and mushroom, or the celeriac, apple, potato, and horseradish, and plated with some mustard greens and black radishes, I found myself consciously eating slowly just so I could savor each bite and not finish too quickly!   The serving of seven was the perfect amount to share between the two of us.  We both got the same small plate, which was a combination of beer braised cabbage with just enough char to really get that \"grilled\" flavor, and oyster mushrooms in a decadent butternut miso...I almost asked for bread to be sure and soak up every drop!    The food here definitely deserves 5 stars.  My only regret is that because you order at the counter, and it's clearly a popular spot, if you don't get everything you want right off the bat, you could be spending some time in line if you try to go back.  We considered dessert but ended up passing just because we didn't want to wait.  The menu is unique and I can't wait to return and try other things...oh and arrive early because by 6:30 it was packed and there are no reservations for parties smaller than 6.  This place is definitely worth the hype!",

The food is brought to your table. The prices are very reasonable given my perceived quality of the food.  Compared to the few other vegan dining opportunities I've had in the past, the food here was a huge step up. From a personal enjoyment perspective, I don't think this was a enjoyable experience (Pierogi, Kluski Slaskie, and salad) at all due to the general blandness of the food. I just cannot get over how little I enjoyed the food here. Perhaps my subconscious carnivore was sabotaging my taste buds throughout the experience.  If you are vegan or a full time vegetarian, I doubt you'll find many places better and cooler than this. But if you are a career omnivore (or carnivore), I wouldn't consider this a destination restaurant for you.",

I've watched the trend ebb and flow, go to spots like quiet storm close. Then the era of wanna be food network chefs with luxury meats coming into Pittsburgh and bacon memes infiltrating my social media feed coincided with a slowdown in the vegan/vegetarian food culture.  That obnoxious intro is only to note that it's really cool to have a new hip trendy restaurant where I don't have to have an awkward 5 minute conversation with the waiter about how they can \"make any dish vegetarian.\" And it's pierogis. The food was incredible and reasonable. Not to mention it also had a great cocktail menu that was manageable in price.  So, if I can have a moderately cosmopolitan experience and eat vegan food without being at a place that doubles on selling eat more kale shirts and yoga mats on the side. Win win.",

I also enjoy the fresh craft cocktails and craft beers available. My fave cocktail so far is the vodka with black currant and burnt lemon - full of flavor and refreshing.  The vibe at Apteka is laid-back, with mismatched chairs and minimal decor. You order at the bar and food/drinks are brought out to you (seat yourself), which adds to the relaxed feel. Street parking is available on Penn Avenue. I see they now have a brightly-lit moniker out front so it's even easier to find.  Apteka will please your veg and carnivore friends alike, and I look forward to many more delicious meals there.",

I'm down with order-at-the-counter, but then the table service should be clean and deliberate. - The staff weren't very welcoming or helpful; I wasn't sure how much or what to order and was met with some sarcasm and felt shamed after asking for some advice on our decision; after sitting down, we were told that a DJ would be coming soon and he would set up where we were sitting...we weren't asked to relocate, just asked to not be sitting there when he showed up?  With such a small place and in such high demand, it didn't really make sense to me why they had a DJ taking up table space to play some low-key weirdo music. The music was cool, though. I'll definitely be back to try again and see what kinds of tastes the rest of the menu works out.",

    "text": "I'm a meat lover, so when one of my vegetarian friends recommended me to check out this \"vegan place in Lawrenceville\", I smiled, but didn't seriously consider it. It wasn't until I heard my foodie friends and fellow meat lovers gush about this restaurant time and time again, that I knew I had to give it a try. And I'm really happy I did. I've been going to Apteka consistently over the last year, and one of the plates I keep ordering time and time again is the Baba Jaga. Simply put, it's a sandwich with beets, pickles and some other veggie goodness. I personally have always hated beets - I never liked their intense red color and flavor. But for some reason, the beets didn't taste like beets to me at all. I can say the same thing about many of their other dishes - they prepare the vegetables in such a way that their flavor and textures are truly transformed into something that you probably have never tasted before. Suddenly, you're forgetting that you're getting your healthy dose of veggies (and all for a very reasonable price)! Other dishes I recommend are their potato pancakes, pierogis, and panapkis. As for drinks, I love the Becherovka (I get it every time), but their Scotch Fernet cocktail is also really good.",

    "text": "I love basically everything about this place.  Let's start with the food.  It is seriously, seriously delicious.  I know this has been said before, but even though Apteka is all vegan, you will NOT miss meat -- or even dairy.  I am a pretty big meat-lover and I thought every bite of the food was not only delicious but surprisingly packed with umami. I might even be so bold as to say that this is the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to in my life.  As the original flagship dish, the pierogis are not to be missed. The owners used to run the well-known pop-up pierogi nights!  The sauerkraut and mushroom one, in particular, is to die for, and the yogurt-mustard sauce is so tasty you won't want to waste a single drop.  I also love the kanapki (toppings change seasonally, I think) and the endive/mushroom dish. As I mentioned, none of these dishes are lacking in umami in the slightest, despite being vegan.  The cocktails are inventive and VERY fairly priced at $6-8, aka nearly half the prices you'd find at a craft cocktail bar. I love their incorporation of pickled flavors in both their cocktails and food alike. The bourbon, pickled prune, and sage cocktail is a good choice if you love a sour drink.  To top it all off, the atmosphere is tops -- hip yet casual -- and the service is friendly. You order at the counter, get a number, find first-come/first-serve seating, and they bring you your food. Personally, my favorite spot is at the bar where you can watch the cocktail mixing magic happen!",

Our table ordered pierogies, lima bean/potato dish (kluski slaske), latkes, salatke 2 (dill!), and baba jaga sandwiches, some to share, and some not. Everybody loved all the food. I thought the sear on the pierogies was a little strong, but the whole dish was such a delightful concatenation of textures and flavors that I didn't much notice. 4 is definitely plenty for one person; next time I might offer to share and get a second dish to share. I will say that the kluski slaske is not visually appealing, but I would definitely order it again, so warm and creamy was it. The Czech in me very much enjoyed my slivovitz cocktail. I would like to come back and treat myself to the rest of the list, starting with the bourbon.",

They are served as two different types of Perogies, two different fillings in one platter; unfortunately the one that had the dark filling was not to my liking, the other was delicious and since I'm a vegan there was practically nothing else on the menu that I could order other than the mushroom soup, which was delicious.  I would say this is a really great place to go if you're Polish. It's seems to really focus on that cuisine; you can tell by the menu and I'm amazed at how crowded it was so I guess having the location close to Polish Hill was instrumental to their success.",

But that should be an after-thought, because you will NOT miss meat here. You won't even THINK of meat here. You'll just think about how every bite is ridiculously good.   Everything about this place is just stellar. The ambiance is warm and inviting, but also casual. You actually order at the front counter and then find yourself a seat. It's pretty tiny, but has a beautiful outdoor area that's covered. I'm wondering what they'll do with the space in the winter, because it's great to have that extra space. There's beautiful floral arrangements on every table, shelf and counter. They really create a comfortable environment.   We ordered the Kartofle z jogurtem migdalowym. Don't worry, you'll probably have no clue how to pronounce anything on the menu other than Pierogi. The dish is potato, apples, lingonberry and yogurt. It's different, but delicious. The potato's were crisply cooked and the combo of the berry and yogurt was great. We also got the Kanapki, which is freshly baked bread (I believe baked in house) with different spreads on top. I wish I could remember what they were, but they rotate daily. Finally we had the pierogies, which are seriously a must get here. One was sauerkraut and mushroom and the other one is smoked potato, parsnip, and turnip greens with smothered yogurt and mustard on top. Both were incredible, but I liked the smoked ones the best.   On the weekends, I don't doubt it's packed. So my advice would be to go early. We went right when it opened at 5pm and we sat right down. By the time we left at 6:30pm the place was packed! I'm not surprised, it should be packed because it's awesome!",
