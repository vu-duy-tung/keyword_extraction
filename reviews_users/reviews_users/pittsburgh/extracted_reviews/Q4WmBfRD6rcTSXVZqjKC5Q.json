I have enjoyed the tuna poke bowl always and the salmon bowl once, only because I wanted to try something else. Service is awesome. The bowls are fresh and flavorful.  I crave the bowl daily and I'm not doing well resisting this place. The price is right at about $10 a bowl and I am full every time!! This place isn't a secret but I know based on the owners and staff this place will be around for awhile!",

You can't customize the Poke bowl at all unlike other places.  While the fish was good, I could barely taste it under a load of sauce and red/green peppers and onions.  It was a similar situation for the tacos.  Also the taco shells were just generic Mexican style crispy corn based taco shells like you buy at the grocery and were not homemade. It would be better if the sauce and peppers/onions were much lighter so you could really taste the fish, which I know to be of high quality from my first experience.  I saw the sushi chef when I was there preparing a sashimi plate for another customer which looked amazing, with a very nice presentation for a quick casual restaurant like this.  I think I'll stick to options without sauce in the future and try the sashmi or chirashi next time.",

Most people from other parts of the city and surrounding suburbs will probably agree that Oakland is an unimaginable nightmare to navigate when regular semester classes are in progress. However, that just means you should come here over a school break! That's what a friend and I did over the summer. Had to be in Oakland for an appointment and it was the perfect opportunity to try it. Everything we had was very tasty and fresh. The sushi chef/owner even brought us some yummy tuna poke bowl to sample on the house (we ordered the salmon poke and it was very good as well). We tried a variety of rolls and yes, we had their famed sushi donuts, too. For the price, quality, and quantity, you can't beat this spot! Oh and everyone was super friendly there. It's not the fanciest spot, not sure if they've gotten to their renovations yet, but I'm not typically a sucker for ambiance and am usually pleased when I don't have to dress to the 9s to go out to eat. I came to grub! Haha. I (almost) can't wait until my next appointment in Oakland so I can drag the hubby here afterwards.",

There have been inconsistencies of the flavoring of the food sometimes though. The salad dressing on the greens can be overpowering at times -- slightly too acidic. Otherwise, I've been fairly pleasant with the quality of the food and the friendly staff.   Food: 5/5 Price: 5/5 Portion Size: 5/5",

    "text": "UPDATE 2019 I am a regular to this consistently excellent sushi restaurant, a still-hidden diamond in the rough not just for Oakland but the city. The menu has evolved and prices have increased but you are always getting highest quality. No matter what you get it is good. The sushi rice and furikake are wonderfully balanced in flavor. At this point I've tried most everything on the menu. Personal favorites these days are eel, snapper, sushi donut, and of course their version of poke bowls.  This is Pittsburgh's best sushi! It's not traditional or fancy but it's just so good :)  ORIGINAL Review  I came for the poke and was quite pleased. After trying the rest of oakland sushi lunches and being disappointed for the most part, I figured I was through, but here arrives Mount Everest. Since they're the only place doing a poke bowl and I love poke it was an obvious choice.   Tuna poke bowl with ahi and albacore. It's a set bowl as with the other bowls. They aren't set up for 'custom' but don't worry about that! The bowls are delightfully presented with all the fish, seaweed,  and bonito on top (adorned by an orchid flower), greens and soybean salad in the middle, with sesame and sushi rice on the bottom.   This is a BIG bowl and the amount of rice and fish given was generous but not put off balance with the salad and seaweed. I got everything I wanted from this excellent poke bowl.   To be honest, I hope these guys take over the city sushi scene. I look forward to trying a roll next visit!",

    "text": "First off, not only is the staff fantastic and the music fantastic but the fish is FRESH and delicious.  I recently got a Poke bowl from a popular restaurant in Oakland, and the tuna was so old it TURNED TO MUSH as I bit into it. I ended up tossing 90% of the fish- so needless to say I was nervous about this Tuna Poke bowl.  And I told the owner this, upon hearing this he said \"If my tuna is old, I swear to you free food everyday!\" And he sliced  me a piece of tuna. People- IT WAS DIVINE. It was the perfect texture of Ahi tuna. Not smelly, not chewy and mushy. It was legitimately incredible.   I have eaten sushi all over the world, and only twice has a chef offered a sample of the fish prior to purchase. The first time was in Tokyo, Japan and the second in this establishment.   This act of kindness and decency truly sold this place for me. When an owner/ chef not only \"talks the talk\", but puts it out there for you to sample: this is the real deal.   My friends, you have many options for \"sushi\" in Pittsburgh. But I can tell you this place offers sanitary ( this is crucial with raw fish), and delicious food delivered with a smile. Also, the playlist here is incredible. If you're looking for fresh and delicious sushi, not mechanically rolled, not frozen and past the due date, not handed to you with an eye roll than this is the place for you!   P.S. I live in Monroeville, but work in Robinson. I leave work early to avoid the commute, and yet I drove into Oakland to get this sushi. Yes, you read that correct: I have a two tunnel rush hour commute and I chose to drive into Oakland for this food. And you know what? It was worth every second.   What are you waiting for? Go get you something delicious and actually worth your money! Pittsburgh has finally gotten an upgrade. Get yourself sushi of quality and worth your  hard earned money!",

There is Korean and Japanese style across the street, but this one is Hawaiian.   Had the tuna bowl and salmon bowl. The bowl has lots of salad. Greens : rice ratio is like 2:1.  Fish are ok. Decent but certainly not best in town.  Lots of nuts in the tuna and salmon bowl. So be careful if you are allergic to that.  Also had their Special Poke Bowl. No nuts in this one.  But, raw tuna + raw salmon + raw onion + raw green pepper + raw red pepper + cooked rice.  The amount of rice is more than tuna / salmon bowl, dont know if they changed recipe or what.  Sauce is slightly hot and sour.    Worth a try, but do not expect it to be Japanese / Korean style because this poke is not.",

He was extremely helpful even though I came in 15 mins before close (yes I'm that person). I ordered a poke bowl, sushi donuts, and the spicy salmon roll so that I could try a little bit of everything. Honestly everything was delicious and for a $7 roll the spicy salmon came with 8 pieces which is very rare! The donuts were so fun and so easy to eat (or maybe I wasn't supposed to eat it with my hands). It was all so fresh also and I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This place replaced the old, somewhat run-down, Chinese and sushi joint that seemed somehow confused about its identity. Now the inside doesn't look like it's changed much, but the menu looks fresh and more innovative--while this is still primarily a sushi place, they also like to highlight their poke bowls, \"sushi tacos,\" and \"sushi donuts.\" I have not tried those latter two creations, but from a first impression the poke bowls are fantastic. They are huge for what you pay, everything's fresh from the fish to the vegetable to the rice, and there's great flavor all around. Most importantly, it's not just \"sushi in a rice bowl,\" which is the closest thing that you can get in a neighboring establishment.  They offer several different bowls, each with a different type of fish, but even that aside the combination of vegetables and salad will vary for each. For example, the salmon bowl seemed to be more lightly seasoned and also contained roe, so that the whole thing tasted a bit more \"fishy,\" while the great white bowl (albacore) was aa bit heavier on the sauces. The picture here shows only a handful of ingredients, including both crab and seaweed salad and bonito flakes, but there are a lot of vegetables and a bed of sushi rice lying underneath, not to mention more fish.  This is definitely an awesome addition to the Oakland restaurant scene, bringing something new and a bit more \"refined\" but not in a way that gentrifies out the mostly student customer base.",

Although they did replace it, they asked me to pay the difference as I was walking out of the restaurant and even charged me for the spicy mayo sauce on the side.

I called as I was walking over, and they had my food ready for me 5 minutes later when I arrived. Beautiful plating all around for both the dishes I ordered. The fish was very fresh, the sushi rice perfectly prepared. My rainbow roll had lovely fresh crab inside and was served with decorative sauces that were great for the dipping. I was a little disappointed that the salmon in the poke bowl was coated in a sweet sauce rather that just being chunks of fish that I could dress myself, but I'm sure if I ordered it again I could request that. There was a healthy serving of greens in the poke bowl, too, which was nice.  The upstairs seating area was well air-conditioned on this hot summer day and had a bunch of basic linoleum tables and a serve-yourself water dispenser with styrofoam cups. You pay at the counter downstairs, but then your food is brought up to you. The crowd seemed mostly young college students (makes sense for the location!) with pop music playing overhead suited to the customer demographic. Seems like a great place for a casual lunch or dinner. Prices were fair for the quality of the fish.",

    "text": "This restaurant surprised me through and through with its quality and originality. Service is swift and the sushi is both delicious and artistically designed.   First, the quality of food. The raw fish was very fresh and all of the ingredients tasted very good. Rolls were well rolled and didn't fall apart easily, even when you took a bite. I was particularly impressed by how they combined all our orders on a plate in a way that made the dish look like a work of art. Personally, I tried the rainbow roll, Mount Everest roll, and the sushi donuts.       The rainbow roll had a very nice variety of sashimi and each bite was unique and refreshing.        The Mount Everest roll was packed with lots of good ingredients, however I'd recommend asking for it without any lettuce. The lettuce clashed with the other ingredients and did not mix well.        The sushi donut was a pleasant surprise. I thought it was just something interesting to have but might not taste great, but it was quite good! It comes with several sashimi pieces on a doughnut of rice all over a square of seaweed. All in all, an interesting dish that was fun to eat.   I highly recommend this place for all sushi and poke lovers, and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.",

We were not disappointed when we came today. I liked how this place had poke bowls (which can be hard to find outside of the West Coast/Hawaii), sushi tacos, and sushi donuts (which are pretty trendy right now lol). My friend and I both ordered a poke bowl; she got the tuna one and I had the salmon one. Both of our bowls looked amazing, had super fresh ingredients, and tasted mad delicious. We're both coming back again, probably gonna try the sushi tacos next. Honestly, a super legit place to go if you want poke bowls in Pittsburgh.",

Now, it appears to have been revamped  into Mount Everest Sushi - the same level of tastiness but with a fresher look and more focused menu!   The service is quick (each visit, I've seen two men working the front - looks like they work off each other to take turns preparing the food, taking orders, delivering food to tables, and cashing people out). I've tried the Salmon Poke, Sushi donut, and the Mount Everest roll here. The poke bowl is a very very, generous serving - a big bowl of rice, greens, seaweed salad, edamame, masago, and of course, salmon. Very fresh and definitely enough for a hearty and balanced meal. The sushi donut is very cute and a good portion for a light meal or snack. Priced at $6.75 for two, it's a great deal! The Mount Everest Roll was also huge and delicious.  The interior is pretty bright and colorful. Like what they used to have for Sushi Boat, the menu is written on the chalkboard to the right when entering the restaurant, but for Mount Everest, they've organized & cleaned up the menu more, added some basic descriptions, and made it more colorful.",

The sushi is fresh and artfully crafted. I think the vibrant colors attest to the freshness. It's a not as easy to eat as regular-way styled sushi, but I recommend taking a bite with some fish, avocado, rice, and seaweed on the bottom for the full experience!   Only waited for what felt like 5-10 min. Perfect for my college budget & very accessible (situated in the heart of Oakland)",

The restaurant is not an upscale, pretentious setting whatsoever. You order downstairs and head upstairs where they will bring you your order. No waiters or waitresses, no fancy decor, the focus here is where it belongs, the food!  I ordered the sushi special A, which was a small assortment of nigiri and California roll, the sushi donuts, and 4 spicy tuna rolls. All of this was about $45 and well worth it. The rice is perfect, the fish is outstanding, and in such a laid back environment I think this place is going to be hard to beat when it comes to damn good sushi.   I know campus can be a pain in the butt to park on and navigate but this place is worth the trouble. The staff was very nice and I am already planning my next trip back.",

The restaurant is more of a take out/ order and pay at the counter type. Seatings downstairs is very limited but they do have pretty good seatings upstairs. The people that work here are extremely nice. One of the guys even offered to carry my luggage upstairs.   I decided to order the sashimi assortments B and the sushi donuts. This was way too much food for one person and I am sure I could have gotten full off just the sushi donuts, which were only $6. The sashimi came with variety of fishes, 3 pieces from each kind of fish. These were some of the freshest sashimi I have ever had. The presentation of the plate was phenomenal and was an art of its own. The sushi donuts were also fresh and delicious. I thought that the donut concept was so creative to the sushi game. I loved the spicy tuna on the donuts.   All of the food came out super quickly. For all of the food I got, my order came out to be around $25.   I highly recommend this place for some good sushi.

Their house made sauce is very yummy and everything just blend well together. I like my poke bowl certain way so I will ask the chef if he can add some extra stuff like jalepeno in there or mango. He always is happy to accommodate, it's a little extra but I am glad to pay it. It is very fulfilling, I am full every time.  I haven't tried their sushi yet, that's next on my list. Also their sushi donuts look so beautiful I want to try that next as well. I will update my review once I do :) but if you haven't tried it, please dooooooo you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Great casual dining spot downtown for some quick no-frills sushi.  Looked tiny initially but theres an upstairs seating area with at least another 4-5 tables.  There were no daily specials when I went in for lunch so potentially a dinner or weekend thing.  Prices seemed a little higher than expected given that it's order at counter type, but I was proved wrong.  My specialty roll was huge! And on top of that really good!  I got the Mount Everest and piece felt packed and the texture of the fish felt fresh.  TBH, there was waaaaaay too much sauce on my sushi. Like drowned, like horribly drowned I used a spoon to scoop off.  But IDK I still had such a satisfactory meal that I'd totally come back.    Oh, dunno if they would refill ginger and wasabi for you, guess you can ask but its not service-based since you pay up-front.  Was a hassle cause I sat upstairs.  I like at least 3 refills of ginger .   Wana go back to try nigiri! Feel like I didn't properly taste the flavor of the fishies.",

We started off with the tuna tacos, and they were amazing. They tasted SO fresh, and they had the perfect ratio of fish and fresh veggies, as well as being seasoned perfectly. I then got the tuna poke bowl, and it honestly blew my mind. There were two different types of tuna in the bowl- chunk tuna and, for lack of my knowledge on sushi terms, mushy tuna (not a bad mushy though!!). It also had seaweed salad, peppers, onions, lettuce (good spring mix), and white rice. It was so filling, so yummy, so fresh. I can't get over how good it was. If I wasn't concerned about mercury poisoning I'd eat it every day.  It was so good that a few days later I went again to try the salmon poke bowl. It had chunk salmon and, I believe, imitation crab, plus all the fixings from the tuna bowl. SO GOOD. You guys I'm obsessed with this place. The fish is so fresh and the employees are so nice. You have to make it a point to come here!",

Perfect.   My husband and I went after a bodybuilding competition and ordered about 6 rolls, sushi donuts, and those delicious tacos. They plated our spread of assorted sushi rolls on a beautiful boat with colorful, edible flowers and plenty of wasabi and ginger. Not bad for a $60 tab! This would have easily been over $100 anywhere else.   He also got the miso soup and said it was the best he has ever had - and he knows miso soup.   I would highly recommend this to any sushi lover. The rolls aren't too fancy, but the fish is noticeably good quality.",

It was fresh and flavorful and held together nicely. The ginger isn't dyed pink, which I loved and prefer. The miso soup was good, but I don't know if I would order it again.

The doughnuts and tacos come in pairs. We ended up with way to much food.   They tacos were served up first. The were excellent. The guacamole was super fresh and the combo of fish, veggies and guac blended together perfectly.    Next up was the Everest roll and the nigiri.  The roll was just ok.  Nothing bad, just your typical sushi roll. The nigiri on the other hand was melt in your mouth amazing.  We only had salmon and tuna sushi but it was on par with anything I've had and I've had tons.    Next up the sushi doughnuts.  It's hard to explain what they are. Just look at my pictures.  They were hard to eat because they fell apart when you bit into them. They tasted amazing, just a little messy.   The only strike against this place is the decor. It's not very nice inside. The upstairs ceiling had wires hanging  from it and it was beat up looking.  It was not dirty. It was just the absolute minimal effort to make it work.  It is Oakland so I'll give the decor a pass, student tend to be a little destructive.  All in all this is an excellent sushi place. I will definitely go back!!!",

    "text": "I called to order and as busy as they were (everyone was scrambling around trying to get orders done), they had my order done in the ten minutes from when I called to the time it took me to walk over there! It's pretty impressive considering their phones were ringing off the hook order after order.  I ordered 2 house special poke bowls and an order of sushi tacos (which came with 2 tacos) and miso soup. They've raised their prices a bit since I've been there last and compared to the menu photos here on yelp so it's a little more pricey (I think my total came to around $41) but still, you get a ton of sashimi and it tastes super fresh. They were all packed with sashimi, especially the sushi tacos, it was amazing. Delicious too!",

Would highly recommend Mount Everest Sushi for a quick lunch or dinner! They have a catering menu with large sushi trays, too. Since the restaurant is small, you can always take your food to Schenley Plaza and eat outside.",

The delivery is actually fulfilled by grub hub. We got a few different rolls...spicy tuna, spicy salmon, philly roll, sushi donuts. The orochi roll was my favorite. It was something different and I loved that it was topped with avocado. They all were absolutely delicious. I really loved the presentation! They put all the rolls on a huge platter and it was so nicely garnished. It was about a 45 minute wait time and it even came a few minutes early! I was very pleased with this delivery experience and the quality of the sushi. This is my new go to for sushi take out!",

    "text": "I think the salmon poke bowl here is creative, beautiful, and flavorful. I love the balance of textures among the edamame, seaweed, and imitation crab. With each bite you can explore all the interesting combinations of salt, sweet, and umami. Most importantly, the fish is always fresh and service is friendly.  Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of their sushi. For some reason, the vinegar taste is very strong in the rice (which holds up well in a poke bowl, but not in a maki roll). Furthermore, I really hate the drops of sriracha mayo that sushi joints often include on their rolls. Having visited Japan recently, I know that this distracts from the integrity of the fish.   Overall, this is a bittersweet review for me because I love that poke has finally come to Pittsburgh, and I should be thankful that Mt. Everest has undertaken that bold move. Unfortunately, while the bowls are delicious and incredibly affordable, the sushi here needs some work.",

I'm always a little iffy ordering sushi from a delivery service but I was happy to see the stars and reviews so of course I went ahead and tried it. So happy I did! Finally a place with good poke!   I ordered the sushi platter with a California roll, tuna, salmon, shrimp and some kind of white fish sashimi. Very good. Tasty. Fresh fish. I also ordered the salmon poke bowl. Salmon, crab, rice, edamame. The salmon and crab were on point. I enjoyed both dishes so much and I can't wait to order from here again.   The fish is fresh and the presentation is lovely. Finally a sushi place that is quality and affordable.",

Also, it's very unassuming from the outside and even the first floor, so there weren't a ton of students lined up to order. There is some seating upstairs. You can order to go out in and they will bring your food upstairs to you. It is definitely the best sushi I've had in Oakland. 5 delicious stars.",

I was skeptical but I was full and replenished afterwards. Imitation crab, salmon, and edamame with rice did the job for me! Plenty of greens as well for the health conscious folk in the yelp community. It is a bit pricey but I can't complain too much. I definitely wouldn't be able to make it myself lol.",

Since he knows that there is already a saturated market in Pittsburgh for sushi, he puts emphasis on his own unique creations and wants people to be able to experience and enjoy them. I ordered a poke bowl which was super fresh and also came with a healthy amount of salad in good proportion with the fish and Rice.  He also gave me two free samples of his raw fish, without me asking for it.  One of the samples was tuna with a spicy Curry sauce that reminded me of Ethiopian food.  I've never had that kind of combo before and it was really good! He mentioned hiring more staff before school starts again, and I really hope he can keep up the personality and level of service that he brings to this place.  Definitely going to recommend all my friends to get food here!",

The DMV area is very widely populated with asians, and so with that being said, many people come from around the east coast to try our sushi. I've gone all the way from the east coast to west coast including japan itself and have tried all sorts of sushi (sushi being my favorite food). Mount Everest sushi is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to especially with the price they sell their sushi at. Surprisingly, if I hadn't known the price, I would believe that this sushi is top end given its fish quality, presentation, taste, and all its other contents. The seaweed itself was very good, it wasn't dry and had a very good aroma and taste. The rice stuck together very well and the texture was perfect. The place itself had a lot of options, including its sushi donut and poke bowl. It's really a great place, I would suggest this to anyone. Totally love it, and can't wait to go back. You won't regret it.  I was going to order more with my boyfriend, but luckily the kind lady warned me that I had ordered a lot and, my god was I full by the end of it.  Totally recommend this place! It's new, cheap (doesn't taste cheap at all), and amazing, how much better can it get!",

It's a hole-in-the-wall sushi restaurant, on the same street as 8 other asian restaurants, that look a lot more appealing to eat at.   But looks can be deceiving.   This place is great! It's easily my favorite place to eat at when I'm in Oakland, and one of my favorite places to get sushi anywhere in this city. They have some wacky creations like their sushi donut (which is pretty good honestly), and a lot of standard dishes like sushi rolls and poke bowls. The food comes out super fast, and the staff has been very nice. They actually will bring you food up to you if you decide to sit upstairs in their dining area. I like upstairs because you can sit next to the window and look down on Forbes Ave, which is always fun to people watch.  I think the food is really good. Definitely get spicy tuna roll. It (for once) actually has a kick to it. So many places don't make it 'spicy'- this place does!",

    "text": "*WOULD RECOMMEND*  As a poor college student who still wants to enjoy some good sushi and fresh fish, I think Mount Everest does a good job of doing so. Over the year that it opened, I've tried pretty much all their poke bowl. The freshness level varies depending on when their fresh fish order comes in; most of the time it's okay, but once in a blue moon when you go in right when their fish arrives it's is SOOOOO FRESSSHHH!!  Poke bowl: I've tried all the poke bowls and my favorite is the Great white (albacore). Theres something about the sauce that they mix it with that makes it taste so good! There's a good amount of rice, but there's a bit too much spring mix (aka salad). The seaweed salad, crab salad, and other sides are flavorful enough that it goes well with the rice and the fish. Overall, it was very fulling.  Sushi donut: Very instagramable! I've seen sushi donuts on insider-food videos but it was exciting to try one in person. Definitely worth trying. It looks so nice the way they spread all the toppings around the sushi donut rice. I liked how every bite is different because of the different toppings. There was a sauce that came with it on the side but I still think there's needs to be more sauce or flavoring added to the sushi donut. I consider this more of a snack than a meal.  Price: Originally, the price was only around $8/$9 but now it went up to almost $11 :(. I guess compared to other poke places, it was relatively cheap. I definitely went often before the price change. The donut was around $6 which is not bad, but still a good amount for a college student.   OVERALL: Would I order them again? Yes, at least the poke bowl  Would I go back again? Yes, because it's convenient for me. Right on Pitt's campus.",

I would like to consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of sushi considering I worked at a high-class sushi restaurant for about 3 years and really enjoy all types of sushi and sashimi. I always will try out every sushi place around me in order to find which ones are really worth going to. I can confidently say that Mt. Everest sushi holds some of my highest  praises. Located on the same street as two other sushi places (Oishii Bento and Sushi Fuku) they definitely take the cake for the best sushi in Oakland.   Most of the time I go I get a specialty roll and they never disappoint. The ingredients always taste fresh and the rolls are made well (they don't fall apart and the rice is made perfectly). Other than sushi they also offer sashimi, poke bowls, salads, soup, and even sushi donuts and tacos which are very interesting and definitely worth a try!   As for the staff, they are always friendly and I never felt I have been wronged, they even have asked my opinions on new foods they want to offer. They have a large seating area upstairs and will bring your food directly to you after you have ordered and paid downstairs. Make sure you grab a cup and fill it with the water spout next to the cups upstairs!  Pricing is very reasonable for a sushi restaurant which is ideal considering sushi can add up quickly and end up costing a fortune. Rolls are usually around $4-$5 for regular rolls, and $11-$13 for specialty rolls. They also offer roll/sashimi combos which are very much worth it if you're hungry and looking for some basic roll combos.   Mt. Everest is my go-to place for sushi and it is by far the freshest and offers the best bang for your buck. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and looking for sushi!",

No food was harmed in its delivery, thank goodness.

However, I saw another customer order a poke bowl, and that has been my go to order ever since.  Everything about their poke bowls are TO DIE FOR. The rice is perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the toppings are fresh and delicious. I especially like the salmon poke bowl with spicy crab, edamame, and seaweed salad. For less than $11, it is a very large portion. I've eaten there and also ordered delivery and the quality is always great regardless!",

Well seasoned, only thing was the fish was cut into strange unsymmetrical long pieces. Still taste the same but a little strange. HIGHLY recommend the spider roll, love the warm taste with avocado. Lastly the yellowtail was super delicious and fresh. I will definitely be coming back for more!  They have seating upstairs even though the storefront is small",

The rice was warm, the sauce was a lot more sour and not as tasty as I remembered--but most offensive of all was the amount of fish: VERY noticeably less than what it used to be. In its place is now an abundance of lettuce. And all this, considering the price hike I mentioned in my last review ($11.50, tax included). I really wanted to continue being a fan of this place--there aren't exactly a lot of sushi/poke places in the area--but I don't know if I'll order this again.   On the somewhat more positive side, the place is still nice and clean and the workers are friendly and service is quick. The salmon, though not much, was still fresh. Overall though, the food really needs to go back to what it used to be :(",

I've ordered multiple things here from the sushi donuts to the tuna poke bowl. It all has been fantastic and prepared beautifully. They always put a cute little edible flower to decorate the plate when you eat in. It's a nice touch. My favorite is that they switch up their menu items sometimes. For example, the poke bowl I have ordered on several occasions and each time they included different ingredients then would ask for my feedback on them. I thought that was really nice that they included the customer's opinions!  Definitely recommend paying a visit to!!",

This unassuming place is right next to Sushi Fuku and offers seating upstairs.   All the fish they have is as fresh as it gets for a reasonably priced sushi joint in the heart of Oakland. I've tried their poke bowls which come with lots of fish and can definitely be made into more than one meal. Their sashimi is fair but after trying really great sashimi, I know it's not the best quality out there. However, that isn't to say it isn't still fresh and good -- it matches the price.   My go-to order is two rolls of the eel-avocado roll. It never disappoints! I recently tried the seared tuna tataki and let me tell you it's ah-ma-zing. The seared tuna comes with avocado and roe on top and sits on a bed of seaweed salad. The seaweed balanced out the richness of the tuna, while the tuna was seared beautifully.   I forgot to mention the beautiful presentation of all their food! Very Instagrammable ;)",

There was a serious amount of salmon and tuna in a delectable spicy sauce. Although I wasn't sure about the peppers and onions when I first read the description, turns out it helps cut through the sweet and salty with some brightness and crunch. The staff was right about the \"tofu with salsa\" appetizer having similar flavors as the House Poke (there's some onion and minced red pepper too) but in a thinner less sweet soy based sauce and I loved it! Soft tofu itself has such a light flavor, it balanced out. $20 for all this and I had to take extras home. The space is probably small when it fills at lunchtime with undergrads but fortunately in the summer it wasn't completely packed for dinner and we were able to sit by the window upstairs. Made for a nice evening with a friend after a long week! I'll be back.",

Early every morning, to the sounds of lip-smacking ooo-ing and aah-ing, the mom-and-pop sushi shops that fringe Tsukiji serve up the the world's most humble and most delicate sushi, embedded in perfectly seasoned rice. Since that trip, I've hardly been able to eat our local version of this delicacy. Until now! Three cheers for Mt. Everest - the Pittsburgh equivalent to those clean, modest stands. The sushi is simply that delectable and unquestionably fresh. And then there's the lovingly assembled, wonderfully fragrant and completely delicious poke bowls, topped with red pepper threads and an edible orchid. The quality of the food is matched by the integrity, kindness and professionalism of the owners who work hard to make this place a local treasure. Excellent all around!",

A simple hard taco shell was filled with a lovely cerviche like mix of tuna, salmon, avocado and other good things. What a deal for $6.95!  If I had just ordered the nigiri I would have probably given the restaurant 4 stars.  But the taco (and the friendly service) pushed me to 5 stars. My daughter (a Pitt student) will have to try the other dishes for us since we live south of Seattle, WA. I'm sure she won't be disappointed!!",

I had my first taste of poke in Hawaii last year.  And of course I loved the fresh, marinated tuna. But it wasn't something I expected to have soon again in Pittsburgh, given the city's generally weak ethnic food and seafood options.   That's changed. This bowl was fresh, delicious, big, and affordable. I'll admit it wasn't as great as my first bowl in Hawaii, but that's not a fair comparison given local culture as geography. It had a bit more lettuce than I am used to, but it's not because they are skimping on the fish. The spicy tuna cubes were marinated in a delicious but not overpowering sauce. The bowl was balanced and did indeed have rice on the bottom.  I considered getting a side, but am glad I didn't because a bowl will fill you up.   They have some other cutesy raw bar options like sushi donuts and tacos. I am kind of curious about them, but may never end up tasting them because it will be so hard to pass up another poke bowl. They also have Maki and hand rolls.   If I discovered this place during the school year, I might try to keep it a secret. But school's out and I want these guys to succeed. So check it out!",

We would have had more than enough food with just the bowls, but everything was so good, we ate it all anyhow.  The donuts are more rice than sashimi (obv) and less rice than sushi, so it was the perfect ratio.   The poke bowls were delicious and had veggies and greens in addition to rice, seaweed salad, fish, etc. The tuna bowl had a nutty marinade while the salmon bowl was more sesame oil/shallot tasting. Both were A ++.",

I ordered the tacos and spicy California rolls. Tacos came 2 to an order and they are full sized tacos! They were so damn good. The tacos were filled with lots of fresh mashed avo, seaweed salad, a plentiful layer of salmon & tuna, and then topped with a mixture of spicy pickled veggies. The edible purple orchid made it extra special!  The cali roll was pretty standard.  My coworker ordered a poke bowl and WOW - that looked pretty impressive. Her only comments were \"generous and delicious\" because she was so involved in inhaling her food.   I would highly recommend this place.  Super understated, very reasonably priced, and soooooooooo good!",

But it didn't come with any sauce and I had to ask for a side of spicy mayo.  In the end, the taste! It was tasty I would give it 4 out of 5. Just because I like to have some sauce to go with my poke bawl. I wish it is chipotle style that you can customize your order. Overall it was a positive experience.",

It can be tough to find sushi in Pittsburgh that has a substantial amount of fish that is fresh for an affordable price. This is especially True in Oakland, where restaurants often cater to the student population with cheap and easy grub.   I've tried the poke, a few different rolls, the donuts, and tacos - all had an ample amount of very fresh tasting fish, and all for a reasonable price.  The toppings are also always fresh and well made. If you dine in, the artistic plating is a bonus. The staff here definitely know what they're doing in terms of flavor, composition, food handling, and presentation.  Sushi is one of my favorite foods. I've tried to refrain from getting it more than a couple times a month to go easy on the wallet, but the quality of the sushi here is so good I'm making this a weekly stop.  The staff is also always friendly and welcoming.",

I've tried both their poke bowls and sushi rolls here, and you can tell how much care he puts into preparing each one. They're presented beautifully and the poke bowls especially are huge portions for the price. Tons of fresh fish, rice, and other toppings. My only complaint is that there's a little too much going on for the poke bowls and sushi. Still, definitely going to become my go to spot for sushi in Oakland!",
