    "text": "The hubster and I finally made it in here to make a comparison between China Star and How Lee. The service here is incredibly friendly and accommodating, and they clearly are used to dealing with English speaking clientele.  Surprisingly, the servers were Cantonese. I liked this because I could speak with them without much trouble, but this is where I thought the food might have been a bit lacking. We got our usual, which is fish fillets in spicy broth and pea shoots. The pea shoots were a bit on the tough side (might just have been due to what was available) and we were able to get the fish fillets a bit more mild than usual. Maybe getting it mild was where we went wrong - Sad to say, but the fish fillets at China Star are significantly better. Allow me to explain just a bit - the fish fillet dish at How Lee's was a bit ... cantonesed (i.e., they had thickened up the soup base with corn starch, which is a pretty typical cantonese thing to do). Also, the fish fillets were a bit on the doughy side, which I think probably had everything to do with the fish they used.   Anyway, this is not a crazy indictment - it was still really good Chinese food, especially by Pittsburgh standards. I especially liked it because I could actually speak with the servers. But if you're looking for really authentic Szechuan food, I'd recommend China Star over this.",

After they renovated their entire place and the menu items, there is the closet place for authentic Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area! Some of my favorites are their spicy fish filet in hot broth and the spicy fried chicken (La Zi Ji). Very popular Sichuan dishes. Their food can be quite spicy, so don't forget to ask for less peppers.   Never mind what I say, just look at how there's always a line out around dinner time on weekends! And it's always packed with Chinese people. You know it's legit when the place is packed with a lot of Chinese people :D",

Note that this used to be one of those take-out places with pictures of the menu on the wall.

The American menu is great; the dishes are well made, with good ingredients and of nice portion size. I should say that I did find their hot'n sour not as good as Zaw's (bear in mind though that this should be a leftovers soup with maybe different flavors showing up over time; How Lee seems to make it from scratch).  The Schezuan menu is fabulous; I'm still working my way through it. My only comment is that these dishes can be very hot, so know what you're getting yourself into as you order.  I've never had any unpleasant interactions with the staff. As in all such things: treat them nice and they will treat you nice.  One warning: If you order delivery the restaurant adds a steep surcharge (not noted on the flyers). So, eat out or do pick-up.",

    "text": "Place was crowded with Chinese people when I visited on Saturday nights.   A good indicator of a good Chinese restaurant.    Food (8.5/10) = Dishes I've tried (all from the Sichuan Specialty section of the menu):  Appetizer Section: 1) Dan Dan Noodles = A dish found on most Sichuan menus.  Classic \"street food\" fare.  A noodle dish with minced meat, with a spicy sesame paste based sauce, topped with chopped green onions +/- cilantro, and ground Sichuan peppercorns.  This dish is good, but certainly not the best I've had.   2) Fu Qi Fei Pian = the English translation of this dish doesn't sound appetizing.  But it's certainly a Sichuan specialty, and one of the dishes I use to judge a Sichuan restaurant.  The dish is served cold and composed of thin slices of various parts of the cow (beef, tripe, tongue, etc.).  The meat is marinated with a spicy oil based sauce, topped with ground Sichuan peppercorns and chopped cilantro.  A great appetizer to try.  Again, the dish is good, but not the best 'fu qi fei pian' I've had in North America.  Vegetable Section: 1) Tu Dou Si = Essentially stir-fried julienned potato.  The dish is done well by the How Lee chefs.  Potatoes are cooked, but still slightly crisp and not soggy. 2) Yu Xiang Qie Zi = look at the picture I posted.  Look how beautiful the eggplant looks.  The glistening purple skin of this fine vegetable.  The sauce is slightly sweet and slightly spicy.  The eggplant is not overdone to the soggy mush texture that sometimes happens at some Chinese restaurants. 3) Kong Xin Cai = Chinese water spinach, or literally 'hollow heart vegetable.'  One of my favorite vegetable dishes to eat.  Lightly stir-fried with green onions and garlic.  Maybe a little ginger?  A clean crisp dish.  It's the vegetable's texture that is unique.  The crunch of biting into a vegetable straw.  Seafood Section: 1) Shui Zhu Yu Pian = This dish is done very well by the chefs of How Lee.  The fish slices are incredibly tender.  The spicy broth that these fish slices swim in is spicy...the level of spiciness where you start sweating.  The glorious physiologic reaction to Sichuan food, while your tongue is numbed out by the Sichuan peppercorns.  Again, the fish slices are big and impressively tender.  At the bottom of the shallow bowl, sits a bed of Napa cabbage.  Sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the dish.  Warning, don't drink the broth, unless you strangely enjoy extracurricular activities such as dropping fireball bombs into porcelain the next morning.  Meat Section: 1) ChongQing La Zi Ji = Chongqing style spicy diced chicken.  Little pieces of diced fried chicken.  It's crispy.  Finished in the wok with red chili peppers, garlic, and sesame seeds.  I can't decide if this is my favorite How Lee dish or the Shui Zu Yu Pian.  Despite how approx 35% of the dish is composed of red chili peppers, the spiciness is not overwhelming.  It' just enough to give each morsel of fried chicken a kick of heat.      Ambiance (7.5/10) = Cozy and clean.  Situated at the corner of Shady Ave and Forbes.  The decor is what I expect of most Chinese restaurants.  Service (7.5/10) = service is fast.  food comes out fast.    Overall opinion = Haven't decided if this is the best Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their menu includes the typical \"American\" Chinese food, but the real gem is the Sichuan menu in the back.  While some of the dishes I've tried were not the best in North America, overall the food is very delicious.  As I've mentioned in other reviews of Pittsburgh Asian restaurants, the prices are higher than what you would find in other cities with a Chinatown or a huge Asian population.  If you've never been to How Lee, I highly recommend trying the Chongqing La Zi Ji and Shui Zhu Yu Pian.",

Ironically, sometimes I missed their food when I was in China during vacation... I've stayed in California and New York for a long time, where better Asian food are expected, but NO - nothing I had beats How Lee. It's becoming a reason for me to visit Pittsburgh again.  We ordered their food almost every week during my college years, and the food made me so happy every time that it was seriously a relief for me from an intense week of work.  I've never tried their more Americanized menu, so I couldn't say anything about those, but if you are coming here for the authentic experience, you should go directly to the last page of the menu. I strongly recommend 1. Chengdu/Chongqing Fried Dry Hot Chicken (/), 2. Fish Filet with Cabbage in Paste Chili (), 3. Sichuan Style Tofu with Minced Pork (). These are all VERY spicy, so be aware!",

I went it and said the order was either under \"Chris or Alex\" (because my boyfriend and I do not have a system worked out about which name to put down on food orders.) I told them I wasn't sure how he had ordered when they asked if it was online or by phone, and they seemed really confused. They also told me that they had talked to me on the phone and told me that I need to pay extra money for the extra rice. I told them that I didn't speak to them but my boyfriend had told me that we owned extra and I was fine being charged for it. Then they told me I could only pay cash and I couldn't have the extra charge added to my order. I didn't have cash so I told the two people who asked me maybe two three times that \"no, I still don't have any cash.\" I offered to leave the rice and they awkwardly gave it to me anyway. So that was my first experience. The whole visit picking up food was like some annoying \"Who's on first\" skit.  But the food has always been really good and it's never been awkward like that again. I've had the sweet and sour shrimp on multiple occasions and I'm always happy. They're consistent and the prices are decent as well.",

I don't know what took me so long, but I believe that this is the best Szechuan restaurant in the greater Pittsburgh area.  I went with my boyfriend to top off a rather exhausting day. We ordered spicy beef tendon, Chongqing lazi chicken, and spicy eggplant and garlic. I don't even know why we ordered that much food because in all honesty we weren't that hungry. Keeping this in mind, once our food came out we devoured all of it. It did take a few hours but we did it. Perhaps the only thing I would change would be the amount of sauce that covered the eggplants, the eggplants were practically submerged. I usually like my eggplant with a lighter amount of sauce.  The place was a bit pricier but the portions made up for it- the chef covered the whole surface of the plate.  The service wasn't the greatest, but they were nice enough.",

Egg roll greasy and doughy.  bleeeeeech.   Never again. Can I have our $$ back? Also could someone bring me dinner as this was inedible.   Update We called and they said if we brought back the food they would either remake the food ( um no thanks) or refund us. So we trekked back to sq hill. The jerks only refunded for the uneaten portions. $28. They were pretty anal and rude. So....yeah. Never again.",

    "text": "My personal favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh. Specialized in spicy food so if you are looking into Chinese style seafood then this might not be the right place. They are very good at preserving the excellent numbness/spiciness ratio for Sichuan dishes. I once brought a friend from Hong Kong and he loved it. Now everybody in his fraternity knows about this place :P  Spicy tofu (Mapo-Doufu) is a must-get. Very soft so it can be challenging to pick up with chopsticks even for those who use them daily. But the taste... It is just perfect. And you will know what I mean if you have tried it. Lamb, fish and pork are all very good. I am not into beef but their spicy beef is also appealing to me. But before you order, make sure you are ready for the spiciness by asking for extra napkins and constant water refill.  Not a huge restaurant, but I have never had problems waiting for too long. Dishes come fast. I tried take out once, takes around 40 mins but came warm and fresh. I had it for my Chinese New Year's Eve feast.   Try it and hope you will like it!",

I'm always a little worried when ordering delivery for a big group that something goes wrong or is forgotten but I was pleasantly surprised when How Lee got it all right! We ordered a 1 tofu, 2 veggie, and 3 chicken dishes plus egg rolls and everyone raved over how delicious it all was! I ordered the white meat sesame chicken and it was cooked perfectly. The egg roll was really tasty as well. The portions are about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant, and I brought enough home for another meal.   2 small gripes. It took a while for delivery and there were no fortune cookies! Wah! I love the crunchy sweetness of a fortune cookie after eating a big meal like that! Oh well, everything else was great and if I were in the area again I would definitely check out How Lee again!",

Don't come here for that! I love me some good comforting General Tso's, but as far as I'm concerned, these people wanted to open an authentic sichuan restaurant but didn't want to exclude the majority of Pittsburgh's population and had to offer Americanized food they don't particularly care about.   But the Sichuan menu... This is THE place in this half the state to get authentic Chinese food. Even my mom approves of this place. The food comes quick, though there is often a wait crowding the door on weekend dinner hours and service can get inattentive at those times. It's a hit with all the international students, so you KNOW it's good. All my favorite Sichuan dishes (shui zhu yu, garlic eggplant, yu xiang rou si, fu qi fei pian, dried green beans, spicy beef noodle soup, etc)  are all top notch here. The right balance of good flavor and that nasty spicy kick that I have  such a love-hate relationship with. We've also never gone wrong with anything else we've tried off of the authentic menu. The prices are very reasonable for Pittsburgh, too. The 'burgh has been missing a place like this, and How Lee definitely rose to the occasion.",

I never tried the dishes that Americans usually order (general tso's chicken, orange chicken etc.) so I don't know how this restaurant holds up in American's eyes.  The food is usually clean and fresh, which can be an issue with other Chinese restaurant.   CONS: The restaurant is so tiny! There is usually a line during weekends and the restaurant is tightly packed. The tables are too close to each other that sometimes it can get a little uncomfortable. The whole place is just very crowded in general. Not a great place for a quiet date night.  Delivery food doesn't taste as good as in the restaurant, but that's not the restaurant's issue.",

We came in on a Saturday night and made a reservation ahead of time for 14 people. It took some logistics by the staff to fit together a bunch of tables, but they found a way. There had been a long wait so we actually put in our order ahead of time - 14 dishes. One dish per person sounded reasonable. This included cold/hot appetizers, soup, and entrees. When we were seated, service was prompt and the dishes came out one by one. The food was flavorful and had just the right about of spice if you enjoy Szechuan food. Since we placed the order ahead of time when waiting, it actually only took us an hour to finish our meals.   When the bill came, we were offered an opportunity to pay with cash for 10% off our bill. Tremendous. After gratuity and the cash discount, it came to $14 a person. That's $1 per dish, per person. What a deal!   We were able to try a wide variety  of dishes which added to the great experience.",

The combination platter came quickly after that, served with chicken fried rice. I asked for their \"spicy\" version which was a small kick for my wimpy taste buds, but if you don't eat the chili peppers you will not be wheezing in any way of form.  Perfect.

    "text": "Since I am slowly making my way through all the Squirrel Hill Chinese restaurants, my next stop was How Lee. My first complaint about this restaurant was the way that it was designed. The restaurant itself is surrounded by ground to ceiling glass windows. It doesn't make the dining experience comfortable. Another thing that bothered me was that the waitresses idly stood by the counter and stared at my friends and I the whole time we were there. As my friends and I were deciding what we were getting, three different waitresses went to our table to ask if we were ready to order which didn't make sense since they were standing right in front of us.   The menu itself is very well organized and offers authentic Chinese food. Since How Lee specializes Sichuan style food, they had a whole separate section for that. The nice thing about the Sichuan section is that you can tell them your preference for spiciness. Since I have no tolerance, I ordered the pork belly and leeks without any spice. The pork belly was cooked perfectly although I was disappointed that it wasn't actually slices of pork belly but pork with fat running through it. The portions are huge so you definitely get your money's worth. I ended dog bagging leftovers equivalent to another meal.   Overall, How Lee serves authentic Chinese food. I might come back to try other dishes but it didn't replace my go-to Chinese places: Rose Tea and Everyday Noodles.",

I ordered the shrimp and scallops which was served with a soup I choose the wanton soup.    My shrimp and scallops came out a little too fast like no sooner had my choice left my lips did the food arrive at my table.  There were literally only 3 other patrons in the restaurant and I don't know why the chef felt the need to nook my food.    I can get better tasting and more freshly prepared Chinese food from China Taste on East Ohio Street.   My star rating can potentially go higher after I have had an opportunity to sample How Lee's dinner menu.",

When I first discovered this place during freshman year, I went crazy and came here way more often than I probably should have. Now, three years later, I still frequent this place when I'm craving spicy food.   To newcomers, the very last page on the menu is what you should be looking at. Authentic Sichuan cuisine, spicy, oily, fresh, what more is there to want?  It can get pretty crowded, so I try to go around 4-5 pm for a quick, no wait dinner.   They've also renovated a bit of the inside, and from what I remember, it's still a work in progress.",

We joked that we must be in the right place.   Everyone has already put up enough pictures of the hot dishes--I'll simply agree that it was hot, authentic-tasting, and hits the spot.   My contribution will be a note on the Xihu Niu Rou Gen (we were all glad to order that--for those who weren't prepared for how hot the spicy food was--it was a lifesaver for sure), which is a clear and starchy beef soup. Chinese watercress was also great (I was delighted they still had  this in late November, usually it's out of season by late August/September). It tasted very good, but they didn't cut up the stems much.  It gets a stamp of approval though, and is a reliable choice for real, spicy Sichuan style food of the \"ma la\" variety. One thing they could've improved was to refill the water more frequently. I mean, if your food is going to be burning up our mouths...we need some relief! (To be fair, business was great, so I could understand the waitresses were quite busy.)",

How Lee's menu is much less extensive, and it usually tends to turn out more expensive as they don't have Yelp or cash discounts (as far as I know). How Lee does have lunch specials, including on weekends, and some good items include the beef tendon, twice-cooked pork, and kung pao chicken.  Usually though, we come here for what has become our favorite item at How Lee: the beef noodle soup. Straight up Sichuan style cooked in red hot chili soup, with tender beef and fresh leaves, these noodles cannot be beat, at least in the Squirrel Hill area. Sichuan Gourmet has several different beef noodle items as well, but they are somewhat inconsistent in their quality, and we have never found that to be a problem at How Lee. Although this is on their Appetizers menu, it is definitely enough for a full meal for one person, and being cheaper than a meal this is very much worth it.",

The taste is closer to sichuan Chinese food which is spicy. However, there are quite a lot of different choices. The food taste is 80 to 90% close to real Chinese food in China. Very tasty. The portion is big, not huge, just nice. Lunch set is quite cheap and suitable for people who may just grab something to eat during lunch period. And the place is less busier during lunch too. Normally it is very busy during dinner time.  It is better to dine in with group of people , then you can order different dishes and share. The service is ok. Maybe due to culture difference,you would not expect big Hi and big smile from the waitress like what you have in American restaurant.   All food is very good, so far no disappointed dish yet.",

I have had the most Americanized, disgusting experiences with it since I was a child, and have therefore sworn off the cuisine entirely. That was, until I tried out How-Lee. On my first visit, I got the orange chicken. I believe they must have misunderstood me and given me General Tso's, because that stuff had some KICK! I got the combination plate with chicken fried rice and an egg roll. Both were what I expect on average from an American Chinese joint. On my most recent visit, I decided to switch it up and get the Kung Po chicken with steamed white rice. Holy cow. From the veggies, to the sauce, to the chicken, this stuff was amazing. I was eating vegetables without having them hidden in a sauce. Amazing. 10/10. Hot, but not too hot. Have a glass of water handy. Overall great experience for someone who has been otherwise scorned by Pittsburgh Chinese food.",

Just make sure you order from the very back/last page of their menu if you're looking for the spciy/authentic food. Some of the things I like to order everytime I go there include, the hot chilli pot (option of fish, lamb, beef, etc), ChongQing fried chicken (sorry I don't actually know the legit name),  beef boiled in spicy oil dish (again don't remember the English name, it's called Shui Zhu Niu in Chinese), etc. Bascially, most of their spicy food are pretty good!  However, I do want to point out, their stir fried potato dish is no longer as good as it used ot be! :( The last time I went, it was sliced as big as the size of my pinky (almost)!!! That was pretty disappointing. Hope they get that issue resolved.... But the good news is, this is not going to stop me from coming back (yet)! Just get your tissues/napkins ready to blow your nose!

When we called to let them know that we received the wrong food, they didn't offer to replace the food and deliver the correct dish. They also didn't even apologize for the error. To me this is really just poor service.  From the food we received: average at best. Everything we got that was supposed to be hot and spicy was mild. Nothing was particularly great.

I could smell the aroma of the Szechuan peppercorn...mmmm.. and each bite leaves your mouth with just a hint of numbness. Not to fear - it's not too strong. Noodles also had a nice chewy texture. It's a medium sized bowl, but we ate only about half to save room for the entrees.  Had the sauteed chinese watercress - so yum as it was cooked just right to retain it's crispness. Watercress itself has a great natural taste to it already, and it was complemented with some flavorful garlic pieces and slight gingery taste.  Also had the chongqing dry hot chicken. I asked them to make it a little less spicy, so I'm not sure how spicy it originally is.. It was nice and crispy, covered with red chilis and sesame seeds. Yum! You can also get the chengdu version, which is unbreaded, so I wanna try that next time.  Thoroughly impressed ^_^ will come back, especially for those noodles.",

    "text": "Made my stop at How Lee's on my mission to try all of Pittsburgh's Sichuan restaurants (not that it's that lengthy of a journey).  Our party of 4 was seated immediately around 6 on a Sunday night, despite the restaurant being relatively full already upon our arrival.  Our server came by to take our orders and drop off our dishware and food, and we didn't see her after that until she delivered our single check for the table.  Though I wasn't overly surprised at this level of service, it was a bit minimal even for the typical Pittsburgh Chinese restaurant, and my empty teacup was sad because of it.  We ordered the DAN DAN NOODLES, TOFU VEGETABLE SOUP, BRAISED TOFU, SICHUAN STYLE TOFU WITH MINCED PORK, and CHONGQING FRIED DRIED HOT CHICKEN.  Portions were super generous, and this ended up being way too much food for us, as we took most of both tofu dishes home and left the soup on the table.  So, this soup.  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece.  Typically, I just love having a bowl of soup with pretty much any meal.  Super comforting.  But this soup was pretty disappointing--literally the blandest bowl of soup I've ever ordered at any restaurant ever.  Like, I know it's veggie soup, but I had a veggie broth in a pho just last weekend that pretty much knocked my thigh-highs off, so I definitely don't view meatlessness as an excuse for lack of flavor.  This soup was tragically not even seasoned with salt, so I picked some of the veggies out of the (largely portioned, at least) bowl and left all of the sad, sad broth.  I hate wasting food, and it's almost unprecedented for me to not take home my leftovers.  So today was a sad day in my personal history.  I was really excited to try the braised tofu, and this was the one dish that did not disappoint. The soft and luscious tofu, drenched in a flavorful sauce, reminded me of wonderful braised tofu (dou fu nao) Chinese breakfasts my grandma made me growing up, also this tofu was a bit firmer in comparison (only because legit dou fu nao is like flan consistency).  I wish there had been more mushrooms and bamboo slices included, but still, this dish satisfied my expectations.  I feel that any mapo tofu has pretty big shoes to fill, as this is such an iconic dish, and this iteration, while definitely not one of the best I've had, at least somewhat scratched my itch.  There was a good amount of \"ma,\" but it could have been vastly improved with a bit more bean paste for funk, as well as a topping of scallions, which usually add such a fresh bite to this dish.  There were also literally 3 tiny pieces of leek in there, which, to an allium lover, was such a tease.  I don't normally expect leeks in my mapo tofu, but if you're going to do it, do it right, ya know?  Same with the minced pork--I actually prefer a vegetarian mapo tofu, but if you're going to make a porky version, be generous with the piggyness.  The chongqing chicken was found to be pretty disappointing by our whole table.  For a dish that's as hyped up as it is from this place, it entirely underwhelmed us with its tiny pieces of heavily breaded chicken that tasted mostly (and weirdly) of a fishy flavor.  Our 2 fellas at the table picked at it until it was mostly finished (because fried chicken equals man food, apparently, rawr) but it just definitely less awesome than we were expecting.  Like, a lot less awesome.  So I probably won't choose to come back to How Lee's, what with better options in Pittsburgh, but I wouldn't cry about it if someone felt the need to drag me back here either.   Perhaps they were having an off night, or we just didn't order the right things.  However, the options, especially for vegetarians, were simply lacking compared to other Sichuan restos around here.  So, my search for the best Sichuan in Pittsburgh continues.",

Since the owner decided to renovate the restaurant and try to make it a \"classy\" Chinese dinner, not only the prices doubled but the quality of the dishes became worse. There is inconsistency (all the time) with: 1)  Portions;  2) Sauce (quantity and taste);  3) How well the meats are cooked (got my chicken raw on last visit). Most important is the attitude of the owner towards the customers and some of the girls that work there.   In one occasion, I ordered \"chicken with mixed vegetables\" and the carrots were sour and saggy with bad smell (seemed to be left overs from previous day). When I explained this to the owner (on another visit, 3 weeks later) she insisted that there is nothing wrong with her dishes and became aggressive, then concluded that I must have been mistaken. On another occasion, I asked the girl on the front desk for some extra soy sauce (packed in small plastic packages) and she refused to give me saying that my meal (carry out) included one pack. I was surprised!!  Bottom line, overly priced place with a lady owner that is rude towards customers trying to get the money spent on renovation from customers pockets.",

It wasn't over done or under cook.  -The green beans was sauteed in garlic and pork, giving the dish a nice crunch and caramelized taste. -The tri-pepper chicken was soo good and soo spicy. If you're not a spicy food fan, then please do not order this. The spice kicks in about 30 seconds later.  So prepare yourself! Eat this with rice to help ease the spiciness. The chicken was also sauteed to perfection. Unlike some places, it was not over done and you can still bite into juicy goodness.  American-Chinese Menu -Fried rice was okay. Taste like any fried rice. -Sesame Chicken was actually good! It was flavored well and juicy.  Customer Service Maybe it's just me but it seems like the employees are usually annoyed. They weren't as attentive. I'm just not use to that in a Chinese setting. So one star down for lack of hospitality.",

Just a reminder: The \"new\" How Lee is very different from the greasy takeout establishment many will remember from years past. It's clean and bright inside, and while you can still get staples like beef and broccoli or wonton soup, you should be a bit adventurous and get something from the back of the menu. We had cold beef strips with a wonderful hot, Szechuan pepper sauce (if you haven't had these peppers they provide a numbing/tingling sensation in addition to the tradtional chile heat), cumin beef which was crisp and delicious, and a bunch of other pork/chicken dishes that I am not legit enough to remember. Bottom line, service was fast, attentive, and the food was good and spicy. Recommended for sure. Only complaint to this Westernized stomach was that the chile oil used in many dishes can be a bit heavy after awhile.",

My issue with this 'chinese' restaurant stems from the fact that 'Chow Mein' supposedly means 'rice with tasteless white sauce'! 'Chow Fun' also supposedly means 'skinny, burnt egg noodle'! Correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that 'mein' means noodle in chinese! When Ingrid and I ordered food from this restaurant, through the beloved <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCampusfood.com&s=eb29b413b2436d037a731a0d7030a39f6509272db2a2cd81278a89f7f20499c0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Campusfood.com</a>, our order was intentionally replaced with revolting rice and egg noodles! We were insulted! and hurt! and offended! We were in disbelief when Ingrid called the restaurant to settle the manner, when to our wondering ears did appear, but ignorance and incompetence! The woman argued with her about how WE made a mistake, that 'chow mein' means 'rice and white sauce', which we fervently argued against. We brought forward a witness who spoke fluent cantonese, mandarin, shanghainese, etc. After discussing the issue, and proving that mein actuality MEANS NOODLE, she refused to give us a refund or deliver the correct order. We would like your support in our endeavor in not supporting HOW LEE and their treacherous methods of butchering the chinese cuisine and dialects. We should have known not to open the bag when we met the white delivery man with a chinese accent. SKETCH\"",

My usual order is orange chicken (white meat only), pork fried rice, and a handful of egg rolls, which is enough food to last through at least a few delicious meals.  I've ordered maybe a dozen other dishes from How Lee over the past few years, and they've always been excellent, too.  The veggies are consistently fresh, and the meat is never too fatty.  The egg rolls are in a league of their own.  The prices are totally reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food, and the delivery range is enormous.

What I like most about this place is that they offer non-standard fare for those who are a little more adventurous, and who want something more authentic.  For instance, I ordered the braised beef tendon and braised fish fillets, both of which were pretty decent.  I also got the salt and pepper squid.  The squid differed a bit in that the pepper actually makes your tongue a bit numb.  This is apparently from the particular Chinese peppercorns that they use - an interesting, and unexpected aspect to it.  I also like it because you can order right off of Yelp - I've done this twice with them, and both times the food was prepared very quickly, and the transaction went without a hitch.  One minor complaint is that there was a bit more \"filler\" in each of my dishes (bean spouts, leeks, lettuce, etc), where as I would have wanted more of the main dish.  I would give this place 3.5 stars, but not 4.",

My boyfriend loves authentic Asian cuisine so he always gets something from the authentic menu (e.g. the spicy prawns, chongqing chicken) while I get something far less adventurous (chow fun, hor fun, etc.) to give my poor tongue a break from the spice after I steal a few bites of his meals.

Parking is manageable in the lots nearby.. You do have to pay though (unless it's a Sunday).",

Pictures of this from a previous Yelp post is exactly what sold us on coming here. I personally would have liked a little spice, but still VERY good. The pork fried rice had large pieces of pork--which I don't care for-- and wasn't super flavorful, but it was still good. The broth to the wonton soup was good. The dry-cooked green beans were addictive. The service was pleasant. Overall, we would definitely recommend and come back.",

The place looks to have been recently renovated, but nothing fancy. After being sat and ordered off of the extensive menu, the server gave us some small plates and wine glasses. A few of the wine glasses had a \"film\" on them that I cannot pinpoint the source of. And then a few of the plates still had a little \"crust\" stuck to them. The server was happy to exchange these items out for cleaner ones. Not a good start, but the order had already been placed so I was going to give this place a shot whether I wanted to or not.  DRINKS - BYOB  APPETIZERS - Steamed pork dumplings. These were so-so.  MAINS - Tiger Skin Peppers. Wow - these are delicious, but incredibly spicy! Being someone who loves spice, I was even a little nervous to dive into this dish after tasting the first bite. Others at the table literally had tears dripping down their faces. Folks, any pepper can range in spice level -- order with caution. - Spicy eggplant. I'm not even an eggplant fan, and this dish was really good. - Mapo tofu (ordered with no pork) -- aka the Szechuan tofu. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. - Others at my table ordered the spicy prawns, chili beef, and some spicy chicken dish. They all enjoyed these dishes, but probably the chicken and beef ones more than the prawns.  OVERALL I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I wish they would double-check their plates and glassware before setting it out, but as far as the food is concerned, it was a good experience.  I will definitely give How Lee a shot again in the future.",

This place also has an authentic Sichuan menu along with their Americanized menu. I'd really like to try some authentic food, but I'm so freaking addicted to their General Tso's chicken that when it comes time to order, I often can't resist the lure of my ol' reliable. Oh General Tso's, why can't I quit you? Crispy breaded chicken, tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy sauce, a couple of pieces of fresh broccoli thrown in for good measure...General Tso's, you please me so.  I've also had a few other standard \"Ameri-Chinese\" things from their menu (egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli with brown sauce, lo mein, orange chicken, etc. etc.), and all are quite tasty and what you would expect from a quality Chinese takeout place.   I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore, but when I did, their delivery speed was always stellar. Now I do mostly takeout, and even during their busiest times, they always have my order ready when they say they will.  Bonus points: They let you sub brown rice for white for a small upcharge, which helps trick me into thinking that my meal is not going straight into my arteries (but who are we kidding, it totally is).  Someday I hope to try to some of their more authentic offerings if I can break free from the grip of General Tso.",

    "text": "Another week, another Squirrel Hill Chinese restaurant to try.  Seriously, there's practically one for every week of the year.  How Lee was our choice because we had an AllMenus coupon code for $10 off, so that was essentially a free entree.  Sold!  We ordered a scallion pancake, which I haven't had in years and was essentially dreaming about all this time, the Triple  Szechuan Delight (shrimp, beef, vegetables in \"brown sauce\"), and chicken fried rice because we're cool.  When we went to pick it up, the place was PACKED.  Lots of Asian families eating big pots of delicious looking food, and lots of white people standing around waiting for take out.  Sounds like this is one of those places with an American menu, and a Chinese menu.  We are pretty adventurous eaters typically, but since this was our first time at How Lee, we figured we'd start simple.  We waited about 10 more minutes after getting there, and I had to fight through the crowds to get to the front to pick up my food.  So it took about 25 minutes total for the food to be ready - kind of a while, but given the crowd I'm not surprised.  We took the food home, and nommed it.  I loved the scallion pancake - they're really simple and I've never had one that was different than any other, but the greasy, crispy consistency keeps me coming back.  Yum!  Fried rice was okay - I've had it better at other places (I think I liked it a lot at Pacific Ring).  My boyfriend really liked the Szechuan dish - it was only a little bit spicy, and the sauce did have the glossy Chinese food consistency, but the taste was pretty good.  Portions were big and lasted us for several meals.  Maybe next time we'll try something a little more adventurous, and hopefully be rewarded with deliciousness!",

I am pretty skeptical about any Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh since I haven't found any 'real' ones like those in New York, Boston and Maryland.   However, when seeing big bowls with 'nothing' but chilies, we thought, \"Hey this must be good!\" We got even more excited when we saw the menu--a ton of Sichuan food to choose from.   Despite the long wait time, we got our table as soon as patrons left and ordered the Chongqing chicken, which turned out to be very popular, and a slightly milder fish dish. It didn't take too long for the food to come despite the busy time. And the food were delicious! We have been to several Sichuan restaurants, and we have to say that How Lee is one of those that we would go back to again and again. :)   So if you're looking for GREAT Chinese food, check out How Lee! My husband and I look forward to trying other stuff on their menu (oh yeah, they also have non-Sichuan food which seem to be the 'non-spicy' ones.)",

Go for the spicy food at the back page where all marked in red, and treat yourself to piles of pepper corns and pool chilli.  We ordered chongqing hot chicken and fish fillet soup w/ soft tofu, and they are just perfect. We counted the dry chilli they put into the dish and found 50 of them...  Looking forward to try other dishes on their menu!",

    "text": "So far I've only had take-out and my experience had its ups and downs.  On the positive side, they serve one of the best General Tso's Chickens I've ever tasted.  The sauce is perfect and thankfully lacks the strange gelatin quality of too many other places.  The chunks of dark meat chicken were huge (almost too big for my mouth) and the heat level was perfect for my liking.  The portion was large and allowed for some great late night munching.  However, on the negative side, my girlfriend found her tofu dish almost inedible and remarked that the tofu was cooked to a very unpleasant consistency.  Also, the spring rolls were mushy and below average.    In the future, I'd like to try the Szechuan menu although it would be difficult to persuade the lady friend to come here again.  I may have to come alone and eat only the amazing General Tso's.  Seriously, it's epic.  Even my girlfriend who is a vegetarian said that it looked and smelled amazing.  If the other dishes would have been on par, this would be a regular spot but unfortunately, they were not.  So for now, How Lee remains an average Chinese option with an above average location (Shady and Forbes in Squirell Hill) that just so happens to make an amazing General Tso's.",

It is also really tasty and delicious. It also has a Szechuan menu as well which is more authentic than american chinese. I have only tried the dan dan noodles from there but it is really good and yummy. I also love the atmosphere there. The food comes out fast and the servers let you be to talk and relax.",

    "text": "Since my last review, I feel like How Lee has kind of gone downhill.  The dan dan noodles have been overcooked (mushy) the last few times, and I probably won't get them again.  Fool me thrice, shame on me.  The twice cooked pork belly with capsaicin is still good, and my favorite dish at the restaurant.  We tried the chongqing chicken, but it was so oily and OVERLY peppery (yes, I know it's Sichuan food but this was over the top) that it was too much.  The best thing that How Lee does is the salt and pepper shrimp (sichuan style).  The sichuan peppercorns are ground up and put into the batter and the result is delicious and numbing.  I'm still hopeful that How Lee will make a valiant comeback.  It's still 3 stars, but with a bit more attention to detail they could be 4-5.  Hopefully with China Star now open (and competing) down the street, we'll all be the winners!",

I stopped by on a Friday afternoon (still able to catch the lunch menu which ends at 3).  Boy, this is the Cantonese food for which I have been searching!  Authentic, plentiful and tasty!  I chose the Shrimp and Scallops Szechuan Style.  The lunch specials come with your choice of Wonton or Egg Drop or Hot and Sour Soup.  i chose the Hot and Sour Soup which was outstanding, just enough bite at the back of your tongue to remind you why it's called 'hot\" and sour.  The lunch portions are quite generous.  I took my order to go and there was enough food for a light dinner the next night.  I also chose two traditional eggs rolls.  They weren't bad, just uninteresting.  Perhaps a few water chestnuts or something with crunch would have made them more interesting.  All in all, excellent Chinese food and I'm sure I will be back often.",

I was expecting the small to be larger--the price is steep for Lo Mein and at other Chinese places the small is plenty. But here it is TINY.   Delivery was fast and they found my place with no issues. (Not easy to do!)   I deducted one star due to price --$15 is a lot of money for dinner when you didn't even get a full sized meal.   I deducted a second star due to food quality. The egg roll was decent but the Lo Mein left something to be desired. Also I'm still hungry because the portion is so so tiny.    Next time I will try a different dish!",

I think for the price you pay and the quantity and quality of food you get, it's a great deal.   We recently ordered from here for take-out. They offer delivery through grubhub, but I always prefer to get take-out when possible. They offer the option to pay at the store, which is really nice. We both ordered the sesame chicken and white rice (I did all white meat for $1 more) and crab rangoons (a must). The food was estimated to be ready in 30-45min, but when we arrived 15 min early, they were just finishing it up and we didn't have to wait super long.   Once we were back, we were greeted to warm, delicious chinese food. They included plenty of sauce packets. The portion sizes were large and the food looked amazing. We ended up having plenty for lunch the next day.   While it's not \"hard\" to screw up Chinese food, everyone has preferences on where to go. I think How Lee is definitely one of my preferred Chinese restaurants.",

    "text": "My mom was craving authentic Chinese food and we looked up a bunch of places on Yelp and this seemed to be the best one. We weren't wrong! I'm so glad we tried How Lee. Their specialty is Szechuan food. We tried a little bit of everything but they also appeal to anyone who wants \"regular\" Chinese, as well.   We started with the Dan Dan noodles and scallion pancake. The Dan Dan noodles weren't as spicy as I thought they would be, which was good for me because too spicy isn't a favorite. The noodles were silky and had great texture. I also enjoyed the pancake, as it wasn't heavy, it was crispy and light.   We ordered the green beans, tofu chili pot and the twice cooked pork belly with veg. All of the dishes were tasty and it was a different kind of taste, one that I have never had before because all of the Chinese I've had is very Americanized. The waitress actually took the time to show us the chili's and peppercorns used in the dishes, so the service was great!   The tofu chili pot was absolutely filled with chili's and fried tofu and veggie goodness. I couldn't even describe to you half of the veggies that were in the pot, as I've never had them before but it was delicious. They also put fresh cilantro on top, which made the dish for me. It was spicy (and they toned it down for me). The pork belly was sliced super thin, not a texture I enjoy but the taste was great. My mom loved it. The bok choy was cooked perfectly - it was crunchy and flavorful, which is rare for bok choy, I feel. This is exactly how I would also describe the green beans. These were the star of the show. They tasted lemony and crisp and full of t. I can't wait to have the left overs of them. I could rave about them for a long time.   We will definitely be back again! Great location, clean restaurant, nice staff and great food!",

I've only ever gotten take out from this place, so here are the dishes I recommend:  1. I enjoy the Chongqing dry hot chicken, it's like spicy small bits of fried chicken, half meat, but the other half of the container is red peppers. This is often too spicy for most other people I enjoy dining with.  There are Schezwan peppercorns in this, which make your tongue go slightly numb and feel lemony. So good!  You'll probably feel iffy ordering it, because the name sounds like a bad, racist Rosie O'Donnell joke.   2. Eggplant in garlic sauce. Huge fan of this vegetarian dish. So flavorful. The eggplant has the wonderful firm but slimy texture.   3. My partner loves getting the salt and pepper chicken. It's small bits of fried chicken, similar to the chongqing chicken, but this dish is sweet but black peppery. Always a hit.   4.  Lastly, we like to get veggie hor fun, because the name applies to us, and the noodles are so wide and delightfully chewy!  I am only giving this place 3 stars because the portion sizes to go seem small to me, for the price. The food has never wowed me, just been alright / good enough to go back to them.",

Now, full disclosure, I got a very basic dish, the chicken Lo-mein, because my stomach had been a bit off the last day or so but it was an excellent dish and super tasty. The steamed dumplings, which my girlfriend and I split were super tasty too, as was the sauce. Her Chicken Chilli Pot was awesome and super tasty too and had just the right amount of heat for both of us (she like more spice than me but it was right in the middle of the road). It was an excellent meal and I only go 4 stars because her dish came out 15 minutes after mine. But our waitress did apologize, stating there'd been a mix up in the kitchen.",

I ordered my usual, Orange chicken with Fried rice instead of white rice (Up charged $2 for that) and I always order an extra carton of the rice so I have it with my leftovers.  Normally it's $2 dollars extra for that as well.  I also asked for the real hot mustard not packets.  I noticed when I got there to pick up my food that HOW LEE had called my cellphone 2 times so I went inside to pick up my food.  The lady (owner) said she tried to call me and that my \"extra fried rice\" needed to come with chicken, pork, or shrimp.  I said, does the fried rice that comes with my dinner have chicken, pork, or shrimp in it?  She said no.  SO I asked well can I please have a carton of the rice that comes with my dinner like I normally get?  She said no.  SO I have to pay $10 extra dollars to get extra rice?  She said yes.  COME ON!  She was so focused on beating me for extra money that they got my order all wrong!  I did not get orange chicken, I got general Tso's and I asked for the REAL hot mustard and I got packets.  The food is overpriced as it is and YES it's delicious but not worth $30 for one meal...  How Lee lost a regular customer yesterday for sure!  I will drive the extra mile and go to The Sesame Inn in the city from now on.  The food is way better and they do not give packet mustard.  They have homemade mustard that is do die for!  TEN thumbs down for How Lee and the way they treated me yesterday.  No food is good enough to be treated like that!  EVER!",

    "text": "I've known about How Lee for about as long as they've been around, having lived nearly all my life in or near Squirrel Hill.   (A little history about the place most people don't know or remember: Back in 1993 someone opened a local Chinese take out chain called, not kidding, Ho Lee Chow. Get it? Holy Cow - Ho Lee Chow? It was greeted with as much enthusiasm as you'd expect from a joke name. While the rest of the chain closed, someone bought the one location in Squirrel Hill, eliminated the word \"Chow,\" but took the \"w\"  and stuck it at the end of \"Ho.\" That's where their name came from. They've been there ever since.)  So tonight was my first experience with them. I contacted them for delivery through Grub Hub (look it up - good service!).  The menu itself was a little light on explanation - just names of the dishes with nothing to say what was included in them. But the amount of selections was pretty impressive. Even as a vegetarian, I had a lot to choose from. I decided to go with Tofu Home Style - a tried and True favorite from other places since I wasn't in the mood for experimenting.  The service gave an estimated hour for delivery. Less than thirty minutes later, they were ringing my bell! Thumbs up for *super* fast delivery!  The temperature of the food was right out of the wok *hot*! I've never had delivery that I had to blow on and wait a few minutes before I could eat it. (It probably helped that I'm only about a mile away, but I give them the points anyway.)  The spring rolls were crunchy and delicious - not too greasy and really packed full. Highly recommended!  I asked for, and got, some broccoli in the dish - Tofu Home Style almost never comes with it - and they were generous too. The tofu was nice and firm - I know it's not good for me, but I *really* like my tofu deep fried, and it was *very* tasty. The vegetables were all nice and firm, in fact. Nothing soggy or over cooked at all.  If I had to make one criticism, it would be the ratio of tofu to vegetables. I like a few more veggies and a little less of the tofu chunks. But for a first order, I was pretty happy.    Next time I'll experiment with an unknown, but for something I like and can be picky about, they did well and now have a new customer.",

Granted I'm a native Chinese, addicted to spicy food and hold high standards for Sichuan cuisine, but with my high anticipation after reading all the 4-star reviews, this place was one big letdown. How Lee was my first stop on my visit to Pittsburgh. I ordered the spicy fish fillets (Shui Zhu Yu), an iconic Sichuan dish, and a cucumber salad, a common cold dish hard to mess up. The cucumber salad was the weirdest version I've ever had, the dressing resembled a green paste made of chives(?). The Shui Zhu Yu was not authentic at all. The sauce was so pasty and the fish was covered in peppers - NOT the Sichuan technique of \"Shui Zhu\". I also think the server did a bad job explaining the dish to me otherwise I'd definitely have ordered something else. It was such a disappointing dining experience, especially compared to my satisfactory dinner at Everyday Noodles.",

It's not quite Chinatown in NYC or Anaheim in LA, but it is very good. The hot pots burn (I had the mutton pot last time) and paralyze your tongue as they should and the veggies are very tasty (i had the peppers and the egg plant recently).  Update 02/02/2011 I ate there twice recently, and overall I am pleased with the quality of the food. The egg plant with a garlic sauce is tasty and not spicy - this will be welcome if some around your table are sensitive to spices. The tongue and tripes with spicy vinaigrette - an appetizer - were better than the first time I took the dish: the sauce was denser and less watery. The hot chili peppers were not as spicy as expected, but they were delicious (I have had them twice already - no disappointment there).",

Recommended by a friend, this was one of the most authentic Chinese food experiences I've encountered. We ordered strictly off of the Szechuan menu and got things like cucumber with scallion sauce and diced rabbit for starters. For the main courses, we got a little bit of everything, but the stand out was the beef tendon. It was spiced perfectly and wonderfully tender as it was probably cooked all day. This place is not your generic American-Chinese place with congealed sauces and artificially flavored dishes, but a more authentic experience that, for me, has only been paralleled in my hometown of Los Angeles",

My friend wasn't so daring and tried something from the Americanized menu. It still looked really good though and the portions were huge.   Prices are reasonable as most meals are under 10 bucks.",

Some of the worst takeout timing I've ever experienced. Also, the cashier tried to small talk me at the end as damage control. In addition, they leave all the prepared soup and rice for takeout sitting at the cashier. This sacrifices the heat of the meal just so packing takeout orders can be easier for them. The food was subpar, as far as Chinese goes. General Tso was a little spongey, and my girlfriends chicken Lo Mein was very tasteless and bland. Probably will not return.

    "text": "How Lee is awesome, and a very legit Chinese/Sichuan restaurant (from my whitey perspective). Went out to eat there with two friends on a Saturday night, waited for 15 minutes, and loved being a minority amongst tables of Asians. Servers were nice and quick.   Fried scallion pancakes off the American menu were homemade and epic. We had the cucumber salad (don't bother, it was bitter - like when cucumbers have that bitter skin). Beef chow fun was delish, though the beef was unsurprisingly un-beef like (but not gross or gristly). Plenty of tasty egg bits and crunchy onions and other things. On the Sichuan menu, we had the sichuan kung pao chicken with peanuts. It was delish, great sauce. We tripped out on the weird taste in our mouths that made water taste totally bizarre. Then I noticed a clove-sized spice in the sauce, chewed on one and half my mouth did something crazy. We asked our server: \"pickled ash, numbs your mouth.\" Sweeeet! I love encountering new shit at a restaurant. I also noted the brilliance of putting in a numbing agent to counter the red chili spice.   In case you're curious, I Wiki'd pickled ash, and it's PRICKLY ASH. Here's the story: \"The fruit of several species of Zanthoare used to make the spice Sichuan pepper. They are also used as bonsai trees. Historically, the bark was widely used for toothache, colic, and rheumatism.\"  Dinner for three was $42 including tip. Goddamn that's cheap!  Two nights later, even though I'd just bought $60 of organic produce from Whole Foods, I ordered How Lee delivery. Veggie dumplings were delicate and yummy; can't wait to try them in the restaurant. Tea-smoked duck was tasty, smoky, fatty, and worth the try - split it with two others.   China Palace can now go straight to hell for their uninteresting, bland and overpriced American Chinese.  Go to How Lee, you will also become addicted.",

Not so long ago, How Lee's was a down-and-dirty corner joint turning out strictly mediocre Americanized Chinese fare for take-out only. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has been transformed into a sit-down restaurant serving exhilaratingly spicy and flavorful Sichuan dishes.  With two dining partners, I sampled the dan dan noodles, the garlic eggplant, and the Sichuan prawns. The noodles were pleasantly chewy and luxuriously bathed in the sesame-rich sauce studded with bits of ground pork. The eggplant had a tinge of sweetness nicely countered by the sharp garlic and swirls of chili oil. The prawns were dry-fried with several cups of dried chilis. The fresh sweetness of the shrimp balanced perfectly with the saltiness and spice of its seasonings.  The service was friendly and prompt, and our server checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased with our meal and to see if we needed anything further.  The New How Lee is a wonderful addition to the Squirrel Hill food scene and I'd be more than happy to dine there again.",

The Sichuan menu is pretty robust, and while I can't help but order dry fried chicken, I really love the mala, the cumin beef and the fish. There are a few things I've yet to try, but it will happen. I really respect the fact that they don't offer a 1-10 scale or any such thing. If there are 3 chili peppers, then the dish is really, really, really spicy. Either order it, or not.  I also tip my hat (and tip, monitarily) the waitresses. They hustle, not only serving but bussing in a very busy restaurant. They don't miss a beat, they don't get your order wrong, they don't forget to refill your water, they bring your check when you're done without having to ask.  Be wary of going on weekends at lunch and dinner--it gets really busy and you may have to wait for a table.",

A little soy sauce and siracha fixed it right up. It's also good with a little of the chongking dumpling sauce. The Kung pao was average, definitely could have used some more sauce. The chongqing dumplings were absolutely the shining stars. I could very easily make a meal of them. Slightly nutty, a little sweet and just the right amount of heat. Absolutely loved them which is why I am excited to go back and try some of the other new Sichuan additions.",

    "text": "New How Lee rules.   Since I don't eat Baby Boomer Chinese food (Sweet and Sour pork eaters, I'm talking to you) this review is totally separate from their \"not chinese\" menu. I only eat from the Szechaun menu  Is it \"phoenominal\" chinese cuisine? Hard to say. I think overall it is great; but this is coming from a Pittsburgh-centric view on Chinese food. You will have better Chinese food in China (obv) and I guess I've had better...but consistency is worth noting at New How Lee.  Try the potatoes and green chiles, and if you ask nicely you can have these dishes made with a tofu substitute, though it isn't advertised. They also get Tiger Peppers, which are extremely hot (or tolerably hot..season dependent) and spicy food eaters would relish in the chance to eat these. They are intensely enjoyable.  I saw another review representing China Star on McKnight and I'd agree it is an excellent place but it's a tough call overall-saying one is entirely better than the other isn't something I'd stake money on at this point. Though the China Star menu is formidable, I wouldn't call NHL's (just figured out that acronym...) menu weak by any means. You can get a hot pot oil styled fish platter that will throw you off; t permeates with Szechuan peppercorn and is absolutely coated in grease. However, spooning it out onto rice gives the intended result and I'd dare a True food enthusiast not to enjoy it. There are food options/styles here that aren't seen in 90% of PGH Chinese restaurants and I think that percentage is a low estimate.  What once was a cliche Chino'merican establishment has genuinely changed...just don't look at the \"normal\" menu.",

The first time, I had their spicy beef tripe, spicy cold noodles, and spicy fish fillet. All three dishes met my expectations and I even took the fish fillet sauce home for my own food. The second time, I had their spicy green bean jelly, extra spicy fish chili pot (see a pattern?), and flat rice noodles to balance out the taste (and to give my girlfriend a break from all of the spice). In between the first and second time, I tried my hand at other Pittsburgh Chinese restaurants and was never fully satisfied each time.

    "text": "On Forbes Ave. in Squirrel Hill.  Across the street from the Kosher Dunkin Donuts.  I like the food here.  It has your standard Americanized type fried rice and other Chinese type fare.  And it has the good stuff!  Beef tendon, different interior bits of the cow and pig.  All meals I have had have been very good so far.  And nicely priced.    No meals I want to specifically point to as exceptionally good.  All of the food is really really good.  Go to the restaurant, and get anything.  Start with the familiar, and then get adventurous.  The interior is nicely decorated, but it is not a place to take someone to unless you know the other person likes to find authentically prepared Chinese dishes.    Items you do not find on your standard Chinese strip plaza type spot.  I like the place, and having it right in Squirrel Hill, makes it convenient.  I have never had any problem finding parking.  I usually just park on Murray.",

I don't usually like Sichuan food but this place was pretty good :) and really go for the authentic stuff. If you are just gonna order the generic stuff why even come here?",

I love the beef and fish hotpots (this is the only meal I prefer in restaurant than take out).  The baby bokchoy is garlic heaven, and the stir fried green beans  and salty and pork-y. The eggplant is also good as is the spicy dry hot chicken.  We have never gone wrong with the Sichuan menu; plus ask a server for a suggestion.  Ooooh, and it is byob.",

From driving by the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much. The inside was a bit nicer than I had expected, and I was impressed by the service. All of our food came out very quickly, and we received water refill offers at least 5 times.  We split a Crab Rangoon appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be craving those cream cheese filled dumplings some time very soon. For my entree, I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken combination platter. It was very tasty and a very good quality. For the food we received - and the Squirrel Hill location - I thought the prices were very reasonable. I hope to return again very soon!",

The soup was a strange shade of yellow and again, you guessed it, tasteless.  My wife had egg foo young which was excellent.",

(You know it's got to be good when the Chinese students regularly eat there.)  Seating inside is exceedingly limited, and How Lee does *very* brisk take-out.  There's a great Sichuan menu, and the Americanized menu is similarly good. Many Americanized menus use a heavy hand with sauces, sometimes to disguise the poor quality of the ingredients.  Here, the ingredients are great, you can taste the quality of the veggies and proteins, and everything is cooked really well. Sauces are used perfectly to my taste -- just enough without overpowering the dish.  I recommend sampling the whole menu. I'm not a huge fan of Sichuan pepper, but I'll make an exception for How Lee - spicy, hot, and really great.",
