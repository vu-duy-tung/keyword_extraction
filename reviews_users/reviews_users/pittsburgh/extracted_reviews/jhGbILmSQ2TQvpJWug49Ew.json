    "text": "I went to the opening and have been enchanted since then. Why?  The CCC is right in the town centre, there is plenty of parking and you get into this amazing, historical building with fantastic natural light. Big windows, great interior design and lots of unique corners to hide or seats to sit and mingle. You can come to work, read, or even bring little ones to play on carpet.  I love, love the book corner and whatever I saw there on the shelf. That's art in itself right there. Leave a book to have an impact on your community.  The atmosphere is so lovely, because this Kaffeehaus is treated like a comfy, welcoming home. Fresh flowers, comfortable armchairs and great color coordination. Forget Starbucks or CTR - they are cold, music is blaring and in a way, they don't really want you to stay.  Last but not at least: beautiful open coffee bar, marble countertop, historic old pieces from post office, best Italian illy coffee and snacks and treats that go beyond what you can expect. No ceran wrapped dry danish, but delicate cupcakes under glassware.  Now I just gotta convince them to open something in my hood ...",

I was excited when a friend suggested meeting for coffee and I quickly suggested this place after passing it earlier this week. It is SO CUTE! It is everything I want in a coffee shop, cozy, inviting and completely unpretentious (not the case throughout Pittsburgh's coffee scene).   I really loved the feel of the space and although I sat at a booth, I am eager to return with a book to hang out in one of the big chairs for an afternoon.    I had a nice cup of tea and the breakfast sandwich on a croissant. My friend had the Illy coffee and really enjoyed it.   I'll definitely be back...and often!",

She was way less friendly than the other four. I assume her name starts with an \"A\" given the signature of my frequent flyer card. She seemed off put because there was a line of maybe 4 people.

Regardless, from time to time, I enjoy a hot cup when it's the heat I crave.  Never have I ever said \"This coffee is DELICIOUS.\"  That is, until the first time I tasted the liquid gold at Carnegie Coffee Company.  It was a lovely day several months ago, during the Yelp clothing swap, that I first had the pleasure.  The barista took a great deal of time describing the process and the actually coffee - Illy (the brand) - and poured us as much of the joe as our hearts could manage.  From that point on, I was hooked.  As someone who rarely crosses a bridge if it can be helped, I recently found myself brunching with friends at Altius a couple of weeks ago and I had the strongest craving for Illy. Post-brunch, off we went, all...the...way... to Carnegie Coffee company to enjoy two steaming cups and relaxing conversation in, what can best be described, as the most delightful coffee shop ambiance their ever was.  Now - back to the office pot. Blech.  P.S. The food is delicious too!",

    "text": "Carnegie Coffee Company is one of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh! And, it is an excellent venue for an event. I held a graduate school graduation party here for about 50 people.  Space Carnegie Coffee Company is located in a historic old post office building in the heart of Carnegie -- walkable to many downtown Carnegie locations. There is free parking behind the building and a large parking lot across the street as well as on street parking. The interior decor of the building is stellar as old mailboxes are the underpinnings of the main counter in the entrance. The large, old windows frame the space and allow in a large amount of natural light. There is both an upstairs and downstairs that is fit to accommodate the circulation of guests who may want to wander into different portions of the space.  Owner Ashley allowed me to have full reign of the space, which was terrific. I could rearrange the furniture as desired, and the staff physically moved / positioned it for me.   Coffee  The coffee and other drinks at Carnegie Coffee Company are of excellent taste and quality. There is a balanced mixture of fun, experimental new flavorings to try as well as classic drinks and teas, smoothies, etc.   Staff  The onsite staff were fantastic! They were extremely attentive to the needs of the guests and took pride in creating quality coffee drinks. My guests commented on the excellent baristas. These guys also spent time after the event, cleaning and closing things, showing nothing but patience, grace, willingness, kindness, and concern. They had positive attitudes and were extremely professional.   Logistics and planning Owner Ashley was thoughtful, proactive, and communicative in the planning process. She was experienced in this and had creative ideas about how others' had used the space. She was always able to meet and got back to me right away. She offered to help in any way that she could. I believe that Ashley genuinely wanted those who walked into the space to have a great time at my event, which was much appreciated. She allowed me to store some decorations and other items in a storage closet. She was flexible in allowing me to bring in my own food, drinks, etc. I did not have to worry about being nickel and dime for every item I used. I also could easily play my own music over the integrated sound system. Ashley could not have been any more accommodating, organized, and helpful. I am so grateful for her partnership!  After-taste Everyone had a GREAT time at the party, in large part due to the SPECTACULAR venue, coffee drinks, and the service.   Here are what a few of my friends have to say about CCC in regards to my party:  -\"The people making drinks were so friendly, responsive, and creative! I wanted to try something totally out of the ordinary and they helped me create my own custom drink!  They also seemed to be genuinely enjoying the celebration, which seems unusual for employees at a party.\"  -\"Very personable barista. Quick to help create a fun concoction!\"  -\"Incredible atmosphere, so many unique spaces to sit and talk, and a great place reminisce with friends while making new memories.\"  -\"Perfect atmosphere for a private party! Lots of room for 25-35 people yet you can still break away to have private conversations and not feel the crowd around you. Service was stellar- super friendly staff. Very accommodating to allow personal music to be played too. Overall, a great venue for your next private party!!  That's my review Coffee section was on point too. Delicious drinks!\"   -\"Baristas were very friendly! I remember talking to them for awhile. Great atmosphere, very inviting, felt like I was hanging out at home or a friend's apartment honestly!\"  -\"Friendly. Accommodating. Attentive. Proactive.\"  -\"I moved to Carnegie because of this place. Carnegie Coffee Company is the crown jewel of a gilded Carnegie.\"",

    "text": "This place stands out as a local joint with great atmosphere.  The former Post Office has been converted into a bright, airy, and open-concept place without losing some of the original interest of the building.  The counter is behind a row of old mailboxes.  There is a brick chimney running through the structure, surely there to conduct heat up from the coal-fired furnace in the basement!  The staff was friendly and competent during my visit.  They offer food, but I just had a snack and a latte.  The drink was served in china, and I was able to snag a second level sunny chair.  If I lived in the area, this would for sure be a hang out for reading, knitting, discussing politics, and just drinking coffee.  I often buy Illy beans to brew at home, and am a big fan of the flavor.  It's so encouraging to see this rugged old town being revitalized.  It's the antithesis of the chain coffee experience in a strip mall with a drive-thru.  Just don't be fooled by the entrance, it really doesn't look like much from the outside, it still has that Post Office vibe from the street.  But inside, it's very hip.",

Carnegie Coffee Company is the only place in Pittsburgh that serves illy coffee and the baristas are all very passionate about their skill!  Usually I'm a straight black coffee type, but visiting Carnegie Coffee Company and talking to the baristas makes me wants to branch out and try everything!  They also carry a wide range of sandwiches, tapa-style snacks, and other yummy sweets!  (A lot of which are locally sourced.)  And back to the decor.  It's so beautiful!  Lots of windows and high ceilings.  It's very clean and calming.  They've got plenty of tables near the front and then sofas, armchairs and benches scattered throughout.  It's totally what I would want my own house to look like!  I would definitely come back to hang out, do work, or host an event!

I ordered an iced green mint tea.  They serve pastries and breakfast sandwiches in the morning as well as donuts from a local company, Big Daddy Donut.  For lunch they have sandwiches.  They are BYOB and starting to offer small plates.  They try to use many local ingredients. I tried an appetizer served on French bread with strawberries and honey butter which was delicious. The honey butter was locally made. You can also rent out the space for a bridal or baby shower, work event, birthday party etc.",

I had tried to visit CCC a few times before, but their relative early closing times (7pm) and remote distance from downtown typically prevented me from doing so.    Finally entering the place, it shares a really unique space with a pharmacy store in what seems to be an old post office.  The coffee bar itself is relatively simple, with multiple great seating areas throughout the building (upstairs, behind the bar, to the side of the bar, etc.).  I really enjoyed sitting back behind the bar in the \"library\" and looking through the ton of books they have available to read.  Relative to coffee, they use Illy branded beans and products.  I got a cup of their house medium drip (they keep a dark on as well) and was pleasantly surprised by the natural sweetness of the brew.  My wife's \"Harry Potter\" (white chocolate, caramel and nougat I believe) latte, while way to sweet for me, was perfect for her.  I doubt I'll ever make a trip specifically for this coffee shop, but anytime I'm in the area I'll definitely take advantage of it!",

The baristas were friendly and cheerful and the environment of the coffee shop inside an old coffee shop is unique, although it's not unthinkable in today's hipster coffee generation.

    "text": "French press is a brewing process, not a type of coffee!!!  This was my first visit and I was hopeful for a good experience. I visit MANY coffee houses and Carnegie has quite a few stars so I was anxious to stop in.  Unfortunately, my first impression is not good.  To begin, the young lady behind the counter greeted me but not with a smile or ANY enthusiasm.  Then, when I asked if they serve French pressed coffee she smugly, and somewhat rudely, replied \"Uh, no, this is an Italian coffee shop.\"  It is? Where is the sign?  And by the way, young lady, French press is a technique, not a coffee type. You CAN French press Italian - or any other type - coffee!  Obviously, the folks behind the counter need more education on coffee brewing techniques.  The coffee itself was uninspired; though the biscotti was delicious and fresh.  The decor, which is raved over quite a bit herein, was, indeed, unique; however, virtually ALL the upholstered chairs (and these were the main seating offered) were/are covered in stains. Pretty disgusting actually.  To add to the less than stellar experience; the same young lady who does not understand what \"French pressing\" is, was cleaning the floors and bathrooms. This in itself is fine and to be expected. The problem was the potency of the cleaning solution. Wow! When I'm in a coffee shop I want to smell coffee, not chemicals. They permeated the entire shop...both floors.  All-in-all a mediocre experience.  I do not see myself rushing back here when there are so many other great prospects ion the offing.",

    "text": "Such a cute coffee shop.  Located in the old post office, it splits its space with the Medicine Shoppe, though the coffee shop has more room.  There are tables, counters along the windows, benches against one wall, a siting area with books, and another private-er sitting area.  That's just on the main floor.  There's also a loft where you can reserve rooms for meetings and where they host yoga sessions on the first and third Sunday of the month.  The barista told me there was an art opening there, which I'm assuming will be a regular happening as well.  Now, the barista.  He was fantastic.  Mark, I believe is his name, was very helpful.  I told him it was my first time there and I'm not picky, though I usually go for plain coffee.  He suggested adding salted caramel syrup to the dark roast; he did not let me down.  It was fragrant, flavorful, and satisfied my afternoon sweet attack without being \"too much.\"  He also told me the history of the building, gave me menus and cards to take home, and then came over to my table to offer more info after I sat down.  Very personable and A+ service from him.  The manager, though, left a lot to be desired.  He walked around with his phone glued to his hands (and practically his nose) and didn't seem to be doing much of anything but text/play games.  He walked by someone standing at the counter waiting for service and I didn't even hear a greeting, even though I was fairly close to them.  Thankfully, Mark was a step behind him - no doubt used to that!  Next time I'd like to try some delicious-looking pastries or a sandwich that they make fresh while you wait - there's a huge menu of bistro-style offerings.  I'm dying to try the grilled PB&J.  I believe they also have salads and soups and grab-and-go options if you are unable to wait.  If I lived closer, this would be a contender for \"my new spot.\"   It was a little drafty, though, and the manager was very off-putting.  The coffee and other workers made up for that, though.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for a while and I honestly struggle with determining how to review it. Maybe 2.5 stars would be more realistic, as I don't think its quite as bad as 2 stars suggests, but I'm not sure the 3 star \"A-OK\" descriptor is really honest.   The first couple times I went were great -- good coffee (some really interesting lattes), decent service, and the atmosphere is super cool (although I'll agree with someone else's review that the armchairs are pretty stained and gross). Each time I've gone since then has gotten progressively worse. The service is pretty lackluster in terms of warmth and welcome (they just kind of stand at the register and stare at you blankly until you start ordering) and I've frequently had to repeat simple two-drink orders several times for the cashier to ring it up, but more importantly it's S-L-O-W. There have been one or two times that I ordered food and it took long enough that I genuinely wondered if they had forgotten about it. The sandwiches I've gotten have been great, although I ordered a Honus Wagner on two occasions and I'm relatively sure it was prepared differently each time. The sides have been hit or miss - the bean & basil salad was incredible, but the pasta salad has been bland both times I've gotten it, and the curried cauliflower soup wasn't all that curried. The pastries are usually good, though!  There are often \"special\" lattes on a tiny little board you can barely see on the counter, but the staff don't always know what they are or how to make them. Today I saw they had a London Fog Latte listed on there, so I ordered it (it's one of my faves) and the cashier had no idea what I was talking about. The other person behind the counter said she wasn't sure how to make it either, and it turned out exactly as bad as you'd expect, which is probably my own fault for going ahead and ordering it anyway. The cashier made some comment about how \"he\" needs to stop coming up with these crazy lattes, but a London Fog Latte isn't some random barista concoction -- it's a pretty common drink to see on a coffee shop menu. But also, if you have a specials board, shouldn't you maybe learn how to make drinks you haven't heard of before? I mean, people are bound to order them when you're advertising them separately.   Overall, it's OK, I guess. It's not so terrible that I would say \"no, definitely don't waste your time with this place!\" but I'd highly recommend going in with low expectations.",

We had an afternoon of shopping in Pittsburgh and wanted a little pick-me-up, so we checked out Carnegie Coffee Company! This place is seriously SO COOL. I believe the establishment used to be an old post office so the design of the coffee house is very unique. Lots of vintage furniture that you can cozy up with your tea/coffee and read a good book! We went during the week so it was pretty quiet. The staff was super friendly and the prices were very affordable (you don't have to pay $5 bucks for a latte like at Starbucks!).  Overall, if you're in the area it's definitely worth stopping by. :)",

Their brunch is always solid and a great price. The service is friendly as well!   As far as the setup of the space, the downstairs is definitely more lounge-y and relaxed, with cushy sofas, bar style seating, and a community library! Feels like a cozy living room :) Upstairs includes more comfortable table seating as well as a big conference table type setup for a workspace. Upstairs usually feels to me like the area for people to do work with the shop's wifi, while the downstairs is more lively, with lots of conversation, coffee noises, and people coming in and out of the next door pharmacy.   The only note I have about this shop, and it is not a huge deal in my opinion, is that it seems that the mug refill policy is dependent on whoever is running the register. I typically bring in a reusable mug of some sort to get a hot coffee, and my refills have been either $1, the cost of a small coffee in a ceramic mug, or the cost of a small coffee. Again, not big deal as it's a small cost difference, but it would be nice to have consistency in the cost. As a customer, I would like to not be overcharged, but also knowing that CCC is a small business, I wouldn't want them inadvertently undercharging!",

Inside, it is huge, one of the biggest independent coffee shops I've been in.  I came early in the morning on a weekday, and it was very quiet (people wise) at first but gradually filled up and became hoppin' and boppin' and pretty packed with people.  There are two levels, and within the downstairs, there are lots of nooks and different areas.  It's quite the opposite of a vast rectangle.  There are easy chairs, tables, couches: lots of options.  They use the Italian terms for their espresso drinks, which is a nice touch.  I ordered an 8oz white mocha and it was excellent.  The underlying espresso was well made.   The milk froth was rich and thick.  It had a well-blended, well-rounded warm flavor that was not too sweet.",

The coffee and specialty drinks are made with the best ingredients and their breakfast sandwiches and various pastries are delicious! The spot is also very eclectic and has plenty of room to go read a book or bring a new view to your \"home office.\"  The owner and staff are always upbeat and very friendly. This spot also has a vast amount of parking on the street and a large parking lot just across the street. You won't be disappointed visiting this coffee house!",

    "text": "First of all I'd like to point out that I used to like this place. Thought I'd call in to grab a quick bite with a coffee and a bottle of spring water. Tried their Turkey club croissant. Attendant serving me seemed very aloof and shy. Anyway, aside for this sidebar issue, I had to ask where to get my 'side'. The coffee is another story. In a world filled with coffee shops, this one used to stand apart from all the other local coffee shops in the area. Now, I guess the rent must have gone up or something because I desired a little coffee in the Water and Milk concoction they served me. They kindly fixed the issue (not without a little attitude) from the young millennial who served me up with a lovely (cold/stale croissant sandwich) which although quite delicious, I have to say crumbled the moment I took the first bite. Anyhoo, I am not one to waste food, considering also I paid a measly $14.66 + a 15% tip prior to receiving my delightful combo.  I blasted a few Indian owned Starbucks franchises for skimping out on coffee content in their coffees so my expectation from a place claiming to be a coffee house, should perhaps step up their game. Dear Americans, learn to complain when things need improving, or else nothing will ever improve and the millennial generation will continue to feel inherently entitled to continue with their lackluster service and sense of 'I don't give a shit' attitude. Have a smashing day!!",

My ham croissant turned out to be a sandwich, and a cold one at that. That might have been okay if it was just the fillings, but the croissant itself was also cold. No one wants to eat a cold croissant, unless you like eating congealed butter. The ham was also fatty. My chai latte tasted like it came from a box, which is fine but not impressive. Given all the five star reviews, it may have just been an off day, and the bagel sandwiches do look pretty good, but I'm not sure I'd come back to find out.",

They use Lavazza coffee, which I'm impartial to, have a fully stocked pastry case with some individually packaged items (loaf cake slices), and have breakfast sandwiches on rotation in addition to a lunch menu. The interior gets its own 5 star rating from me; it's open but not loud in the way open areas with exposed industrial ceilings are, colorful but tasteful, clean, and has a loft style second floor with extra seating. Parking was easy to find around the corner, especially on a Sunday. I got the vanilla latte and Jackhammer sandwich with a side (included, and sides are on rotation as well) of red lentil soup. The latte was smooth and vanilla wasn't overpowering. I know from amateur experience how easy it is to make burnt tasting lattes that you try to cover up with extra syrup, and that wasn't the case here. The sandwich was on the lunch menu but was great as a brunch item because of the fried egg. Coming back again the next free Sunday I have!",

It was just the perfect venue, not only because they have a private adorable upstairs room, but they made it so easy to organize.   The space holds up to 30 people and is super comfortable at that amount. I love the mix of table seating and couches, you can really spread out if you want to. The rate to rent the room during normal business hours is $50 an hour, which I think is totally reasonable. You choose from a simple menu of sandwiches, salads and charcuterie boards that they make in house. The food was beautifully displayed and marked appropriately. They even made special gluten free items for me and a few others.   I also like that you have the option to bring in your own desserts. If you want to serve alcohol it's $2 a head. You can also either have a coffee carafe or choose to have people order at the coffee bar. We chose the later option and it honestly wasn't a crazy amount.   I will note that communication between the event planner was excellent. She answered all of my questions promptly and made things so easy. I appreciate that, because half of planning an event is the coordination.   Definitely consider this for your next shower, birthday or get together!",

The business operates out of the former Carnegie Post Office, so you can actually still see some of the postal boxes when you place your order. I am admittedly not a coffee drinker, but I know it's a big deal here - the cafe's claim to fame is being the only coffee house in Western Pennsylvania serving Illy coffee.  I personally come here for the sweets and the smoothies (and hopefully one day, to try their breakfasts and sandwiches). The smoothies are always fantastic - not too thick, not too runny, good at balancing the ingredients and getting the flavors right - and once you add some whipped cream on top you'll have quite a tasty drink to brighten your day. I know that some of the sweets come from another business, but I believe others are indeed made in house, such as an amazing fresh brownie that I told myself I wouldn't eat in one sitting. Oops.  Most importantly, unlike many shops - where I'm perfectly happy purchasing and carrying on with my day - this little coffee place screams to me \"stay!\" And it's not just because of the phone booth that's included in the decor, although that makes me grin; it's the cute tables, the cozy nooks, and the fact that one section literally feels like a lounge, complete with bookshelves. All of it is clean and bright and cheerful, and I really want to set aside time to just hang out here with a book. The place was designed with exactly that intention (i.e. a European cafe), and one day I plan to take advantage of that design to the fullest.   Whether you stick around or you do get your order to go, this place is totally worth visiting. The staff are always nice, the place is downright beautiful, and everything I've ordered has been delicious. I will definitely be back!",

Not only is Carnegie Coffee great for your every day Coffee fix, or a place to work or study, but they also offer a nice little event space. I liked the atmosphere so much that I chose to have my bridal shower there on a Sunday. It was great, not overly expensive, and they were extremely easy and pleasant to work with!

    "text": "I stopped over here on my way home from Bloomfield to see what makes this place so special. It is located in the old Post office building directly across from the pay parking lot in the center of Main St in Carnegie.   They serve lunches here as well as desserts in addition to coffee and tea. Since I was already caffeined out from my tea that I just had in Bloomfield I deferred the expresso for a dark roast to have less caffeine. Prices are very reasonable for the sizes you can order..As I looked at the various desserts I saw one gingerbread man which is my favorite Christmas cookie. I decided to  have it with my coffee.  I learned from the counterman that their desserts come from Mediterra bakery. I have been to that bakery before and have been well pleased with their offerings. I took my coffee and settled in the back room where they have a library of books you can look at along with and old style phone booth. They have low couches and chairs where you can sit and relax and there are other tables that I noticed if you wish to work from a laptop.  i got to chatting with two people who were finishing up a demi cup of expresso latte which I was told was very good.  My coffee was not overbearing but just right once i added my cream and sugar. This was indeed one of the better coffees in quite some time. The gingerbread man was so good I polished him off in no time flat!  inside this same building is a Medicine shoppe and does have a handicapped accessible ramp if you are not able to climb the stairs. I like the fact that it is centrally located and gives you a place to relax and unwind.  Highly recommend when you visit Carnegie's business district!",

Had a latte with almond milk and a touch of honey -- tasted great but I wish they offered local honey, especially since they are a local business and could easily support a local honey maker. Great to see they offer some pastries made at a local bakery. They offer some really nice breakfast and lunch sandwich combinations with options for meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. I just wish they tried to offer some organic, hormone-free, and/or locally-sourced ingredients for some items like eggs, meats, cheeses, and/or veggies. Big kudos for the vegetarian/unique food options as well as the inviting/comforting space. Would be nice to see more focus on quality ingredients for food.",

Easy, but very important: 1. the WiFi is terrible, *when* it works, which is not often. 2. The vast majority of the seating is not in range of a power outlet. I have not tried the food.",

I was the only person in line, there was one drink order ahead of me and it took 12 minutes to make a medium latte with skim milk. 12 freaking minutes. The guy making drinks seemed like he was on something, he started the drink before mine, then dumped it, then poured syrup, then dumped it, then he got a new cup and started over again. WTF dude? Seriously. Then he just completely stopped making drinks to talk to a customer. I was about 2 minutes away from leaving my drink because he was going to make me late for work.",

Well I asked the right people, while they don't have one thing they're know for they have a ton of amazing choices and one of the workers ( I believe she might be the owners) favorites is a rose and cinnamon latte and I said sign me up to that. Boy was I so happy with the outcome. It's not too over powering and so delicious. I would I highly recommend it. And this coffee shop. The staff was super friendly and again everything was delicious.

Also quiet if you need a place to get some work done or study. Parking across the street in pay lot or regular street parking. For food options, they have soups, salads and sandwiches which are made fresh and quick. Also some ready made options in the cooler. Staff is always friendly and service is quick. Prices are average. My husband and I both ate lunch with drinks for I think around $20. I highly recommend the vegetable panini and roasted pepper soup for lunch. The sandwich was packed with veggies and was not at all greasy, exactly how I like it. The roasted pepper soup was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I only wish I could get here more often!

We both got breakfast sandwiches that were better than the traditional sandwiches you get at other coffee shops.  I had the western omelette on an everything bagel and my friend got the Florentine omelette on a croissant. My vanilla latte was the right amount of sweetness and the design with the foam on the top was adorable.  They have little nooks and crannies with chairs and books scattered throughout where you can hang out and the order counter still has the original post office boxes.  Carnegie is becoming such a chic, cool place to be and I will definitely be back to visit this place.",

Top that off with a loft space with comfy chairs and a great selection of books, and you've got a great place to lose yourself for a few hours...or more! After a great Yelp event here, I had mentally bookmarked this place and when I found myself hungry in Carnegie, I stopped in with a friend for a sandwich. While service wasn't quick, it was certainly friendly, and they happily obliged my request to press my BLT panini-style--toasty, toasty deliciousness. For $8, you get a freshly made sandwich and side, and there's a pitcher of water around for those of us who don't forsake the tap. I'm not in Carnegie much, but I just might have to make it out there more often, especially with ample parking available for $0.25/hour (but bring quarters!)...beats Oakland prices any day!",

    "text": "My husband and I have always been complaining that there are no good places to walk/ride a bike, or even drive to near our house in Crafton.  Especially coffee shops.  We pride ourselves on finding the best espresso, and are always comparing different places in the city.  We found out about a coffee shop that opened in Carnegie and had to give it a chance, even though we were in the frame of mind, that it wouldn't be that great.  I mean, it is carnegie, and we have been holding out hope for great businesses to open there, we have been let down thus far.  When we arrived at the old Post Office (there location) we were blow away by the amount of wrok they put into the place.  It was gorgeous, spacious, and clean.  Very modern and bright looking, with an upstairs that begs for a wine bar, or event space.  O.K we thought, let's see what the beans are about.  They boast Illy brand, and their espresso was right where it needed to be to keep us coming back for more.  We are already planning our next Saturday's weekly bike ride.  We finally got what we wanted, a perfect spot to bring in the locals.  I truly hope everyone supports this place, and we can continue to build Main Street up to what it should be (a mini Lawrenceville would be nice)  It looks like it is on it's way!   Great job Carnegie Coffee.  Keep it up, and we will see you soon!",

    "text": "Happy to have a local coffee shop in my neighborhood. It won't become my go to destination for top notch coffee in pittsburgh as there are other local shops that serves a better product (coffee roaster wise) but I will definitely support them. I'm glad they offer local baked goods and lunch items, with that said, I'm surprised they use illy coffee which is far from being local or even remotely a decent coffee roaster. I wish they would use a local coffee roaster ie; commonplace, 19 coffee,  or even perhaps aldo coffee co. There are far better choices close to home that focuses on more sustainable, in season, coffees. I enjoyed the minimalist decor and found it to be inviting and friendly. What a great idea to pair with the medicine shoppe, it'll be good for business as they both can thrive off each other and I'm sure reduce overheads. Smart. They have potential as they improve their barista skills with time and practice and maybe hopefully change their coffee roaster.",

    "text": "I was thrilled to learn that there was a coffee shop opening up in my hometown of Carnegie. I'm a local student and have my favorite coffee shops on and around campus, but I've never been able to find a good study locale when I'm back in town to visit my parents for a long weekend. Carnegie Coffee Company is everything I was looking for. Right when I walked in, the staff greeted me and was very friendly as I reminisced about the old post office (which is what this particular locale was when I was growing up!). In that regard, they have repurposed a number of details from the old post office, which I thought was a lovely touch. I spent a Sunday morning/early afternoon here, and the ambiance was relaxing and quiet, despite the steady flow of patrons coming in and out for their Sunday morning coffee and newspapers.  As for the food/beverages, Carnegie Coffee Co. serves Illy products, which I've had the fortune to try at the original Dozen Bake Shop in Squirrel Hill (RIP) as well as outside of Pittsburgh. I treated myself to a white mocha, which had just enough sweetness to keep me from attacking the doughnuts, which they bring in daily from local favorite Big Daddy Donuts in Crafton. I did splurge on some soup for lunch, which was tomato arugula on the day of my visit. Served with a baguette and butter (!), the soup was flavorful and warm with an ever so slight chunk factor that gave the soup good texture. It definitely hit the spot on a somewhat dreary summer Sunday mid-morning.  Final verdict: I will be back to Carnegie Coffee Company whenever I need to get some studying done to the tunes of a warm cup of coffee and just a hint of childhood nostalgia for this Carnegie girl.",

You can sit downstairs on the cute chairs, or upstairs on the comfy couch. They offer wifi which is nice although sometimes it's not the best. But they do have a wide array of food options.   I've heard this building used to be a post office and that just makes this place even cooler! The counter is on top of some old mailboxes! And all the furniture is classic and beautiful.   And finally, a really nice feature is the convenient store located in the lobby. Very, um, convenient!",

But their food selection has unfortunately gone way downhill over the past few months. They used to have a unique selection of pastries/desserts every day like seven layer bars, and now all they ever offer are bland scones and croissants. I finally asked them about it and they informed me their baker no longer worked there. I really hope they find a new one or train someone else because that was a huge draw of coming here. I now have less and less desire to come back each time I visit, which is unfortunate since it's such a cool looking spot.",
