The four corner Detroit style pizza is unique, especially in a city that isn't known for their pizza.  The flavors are incredible! You will not be disappointed.  I also bought one to take home for dinner the next day.   Don't forget about the waffle fries and arugula salad, perfect combination with a pizza.",

    "text": "Great pizza, and in a town that is not known for many good pizza options.   We went to the Federal Galley last night specifically to try Detroit style pizza, and outside of a hard time finding parking because of the Pirates game going on at the same time there was no negative.  We ordered two pizzas to split between three of us and got them to cut the pizzas into six cuts instead of four.  The first thing was received is the white pizza. I'm from Northeastern PA and an area known for its great pizza....but this is easily the best white pizza I've ever had. The lemony smell and slight lemony taste was great, and not overpowering at all. The crust was thick and crispy, burnt to a golden brown. Thinking about this pizza now makes me want to go back and get some more already.  I also tried the chorizo pizza and that was also very good. Similar crust but obviously totally different taste. The chorizo was good. It had decent spice but was hardly spicy. I'd give this one more of a four star compared to the white pizza but it was still very good.",

I do fancy myself a pizza enthusiast, however, and this place reminded me why. The dough is light, airy and succulent. The flavors were on point. That by itself would be enough for a return visit, but to top it off, Kristin (of Kristin and Nate, proprietors and chefs of M&T) is the bees knees. She schooled me on what makes a good Detroit-style pizza, and honestly a good pizza period. We shared stories on dough experiments and I left with a hunger to make more pizza at home. And to return to Michigan & Trumbull - because there isn't much better than good pizza coupled with good people.",

Some are ok, a little too chewy, a little too greasy, taste like nothing, on and on. I never found my soulmate pizza. Neither did my Jersey husband. When people ask us where to get good pizza I always jokingly say, \"parkway east, turnpike, and head east for at least 6 hours.\" We came to Federal Gallery on a whim after a dinner party fell through, and we were determined not to waste a sitter. I love a thicker crust pizza, and I heard rumblings of Detroit-style here. Saw the packard pepperoni and my tiny heart had pangs of hope, but I've been fooled so many times before. Then the pizza comes out. I raised my arms involuntarily in triumph. \"Are you ok?\" Says the girl dropping the food. No miss. No ma'am. And it tasted better than it looked! Salty, crispy, thick but somehow light, gloriousness. I legit almost cried. My husband and I finished with absolute glee. We walked back to look at the other pizzas and I saw a woman who I remembered in an article as being one of the owners. \"Ohhhh I'm going to go hug her\" I say to my husband. He informed me it would be unwise to surprised someone who was crouched in front of a blazing oven. Ok. Fair enough. But you've been warned Michigan and Trumbull pizza genius people. Watch out for random hugs!",

The thick crispy crust is what makes a pizza delicious in my opinion, but of course some delicious toppings don't hurt either. I went with half of the special Quattro Fromaggio and half Vegan (because I was really curious about the egglplant). The 4 cheese definitely stole the show but I would recommend the vegan to any of my plant loving friends. I will definitely be back to try to the pepperoni and the white! Also I must note the customer service was excellent- a big win in my book!",

    "text": "As a relocated Detroiter, Michigan & Trumbull is the perfect taste of home. The other Pittsburgh Detroit style pizzerias in town are Jets (a local favorite chain-pizza, but still a chain-pizza) and Iron Born (who seem to use Detroit-style pizza as opportunistically and inauthentically as their silly name).  Unlike the competition, Kristen and Nate have created a beautiful love letter to Detroit pizza that both masters the technique and enhances it. The names of each pie will be familiar to any Detroiter, and the flavors range from familiar to inspired.  The Packard Pepperoni is a neat twist on the standard pepperoni pizza that introduces pickled chiles and hot honey for a spicy/sweet delicious pizza. The St Aubin Sausage and Bagley Chorizo are totally new ideas that I would be surprised to see on a Detroit pizzeria's menu, but they are executed with delicious perfection.  The Woodward Ave White is as much a standout as the road that is its namesake. Ricotta cheese, garlic oil, pepper flakes and lemon zest combine to create a unique and delicious flavor.  Michigan & Trumbull gets bonus points for authenticity by stocking Vernors and Faygo beverages, both being favorite Detroit products. They take it up a further notch with their delicious Detroit style Coney Dogs, offered as a special item on Mondays.  Kristen and Nate haven't forgotten about brunch either. They generally offer a pizza with ham or eggplant, topped with roasted tomatoes and a basil pesto that is my favorite brunch item in town. It is often joined by a brioche waffle, topped with whatever the hell they want to blow your mind in a given week. I have never been disappointed.",

I'm not exactly sure what the name of the pizza was, but it was the one with Mikes Hot Honey on it. YES! So. Good. I loved the combination of flavors and hot honey is tasty on nearly everything - but gave a perfect sweet kick to this pizza. If you like spicy food, definitely try this one!

I wish they would put the fries on the pizza so I could give them all my monies but I understand why they don't. You can't have the best of everything on one thing.  I have zero complaints about this place as they absolutely know what they're doing. I appreciate the consistency and the fact that I can't by pizza by the slice instead just buy the box and eat some for lunch, dinner and breakfast because adulthood.

We are currently working our way through their list and have not even had a bad bite.   Each pizza comes with the crispy cheese crust.  Yum.  I never eat the crust on pizza until now. Ok folks.

They were great people and in talking my boyfriend tells them I'm from Detroit.  They came to ask how we liked our pizza and it was seriously soooo good!  The teader fries mimicked BetterMade chips.  If you're from Detroit, BetterMade chips were a food group.  They also sell Faygo & Vernors, other Detroit staples.  We just had the pepperoni pizza, but will definitely be back.  Pittburghers act like they barely know where Detroit is, but I'm glad Michigan & Trumbull are here to represent!  Oh and I love that the pizza are named for popular streets in Detroit.  Next, they need a Coney Dog pizza.",

    "text": "Federal Galley spotlight-Michigan and Trumbull. Whenever I visit Federal Galley these days it's for the purpose of introducing family and friends who have never had the opportunity to experience it.  I took my daughter here today since she is a pizza lover. Catching up with their chefs- Kristen Calverley and Nate Peck,they were glad to meet her. Their recommendation to us was the Woodward Ave white pizza. This pizza comes with mozzarella, ricotta, red pepper flake, lemon zest, and olive oil.   Nate told us it is normally cut in quarters but it could be cut 6 ways if we preferred. We thought since we were sharing that 4 cuts would be enough. The size was 8x10 inch pizza.  I explained to my daughter the drill-take a number, grab your napkins, utensils, and plates from a nearby station and sit down. Federal Galley for some reason was fairly empty this visit but finding parking was nearly impossible!! Guess it all depends upon the time you go.  We got our pizza within a reasonable length of time. My daughter was thrilled to learn they put some cheese in the burnt appeared crust. With all the cheeses the two slices were quite filling. In addition you can really taste the red pepper. Good thing we had plenty of water to drink.  My daughter really liked the way it was prepared and appreciated the chef style in which it was made.  Michigan and Trumbull also serves fries, salads, and even has a brunch menu for Sats and Suns. Open daily they make a welcome addition for upscale pizza in the Pittsburgh North Side neighborhood.",

There's a little honey on top, which sounds strange at first, but works so well with this flavor mix.

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Mondays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had come to the Federal Galley as part of a wonderful Yelp event and after trying all of the restaurants decided to finish our dinner with a pizza from Michigan and Trumbull.  As with all of the restaurants in the Galley this is a walk up counter where you place your order, they give you a number and then deliver your food to you at your table.  Due to that there isn't too much to say about the \"restaurant\" itself.  They do serve Michigan style pizzas here which means that they are cooked in a cast iron type skillet which gives it a nice crust.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split the bagley chorizo.  The menu described the bagley chorizo as a pizza with mozzarella, pickled red onions, chorizo and cilantro ranch.  After only a couple of minute wait our pizza was brought out to us.  It looked delicious, especially the caramelized edges and crust but I couldn't help but wonder about it's size (4 pieces) for the $16 that it cost.  Thankfully it tasted as good as it looked as the crust had a nice and crispy exterior while the chorizo brought the spice and the pickled onions added a much appreciated hit of acidity.  Combine that with the cilantro ranch drizzle and it was a really cohesive pizza.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  Their pizza was delicious and although I am not sure it was worth the cost, I do enjoy supporting local businesses.",

After the corporate conglomerate Grubhub never delivered our pizza to our home we went to Michigan & Trumbull in person and explained our dilemma. They were appalled and promptly gave us the same order free of charge because, 'our food and our reputation is everything.' From a fellow business owner- those words mean the difference between a successful business and a failing one.

    "text": "Michigan and Trumbull...where do I begin? By now I would expect the word to have traveled far about how incredible their pizza is. One of the four food vendors in Federal Galley, I have brought numerous out-of-town guests and family members here just to try the pie. And the consensus is strong - everyone loves their pie. I was so extremely ecstatic to initially find out their dough is vegan friendly. And off the bat they had an awesome vegan pizza on the menu. That just warms my heart. The original vegan pie was killer, with roasted eggplant and a walnut romesco, topped with scallions and cilantro. It was unique and I've never had a pairing quite like that on a pizza before, but of course it was delicious. I was excited when I saw they updated their vegan pie, it's now a red sauce, unlimited choice of vegetables, and topped with arugula....and just $8! Price cannot be beat for the size of the pie! The slices, four to a pie, are quite filling. And every time I saw my boyfriend enjoying the \"Packard Pepperoni\" - red sauce, mozzarella, pickled chiles (which I always steal), pepperoni and hot honey, I was always yearning for the juicy deliciousness of their vibrant red sauce. 10/10 for the new vegan pie. I always see their \"Teader Fries\" as a big seller, crispy waffle fries with BBQ chip spice, served with cilantro ranch. Dying to give them a try but the pizza is always more than enough. Not too long ago they added some new salads as well. They're super active on Instagram so if you're active be sure to check for weekly specials or closures due to private events. I think I read this duo is moving back to their hometown of Detroit, I don't even want to know when that will be. Until then, I'll get myself to Federal Galley as often as it is healthy to eat pizza at every meal.",

There is something about that square thick dough that speaks to me on a spiritual level. I'm obsessed. I find M&T's version less salty and the dough is softer.   The first time I tried one with a white sauce and what I believe was arugula. The pizza itself was great, just too many greens. Since then I've stuck with the Packard Pepperoni. Don't be scared by \"pickled chiles.\"  They're not overly hot and the hot honey adds the perfect sweetness. It is pepperoni pizza perfection. I would love to branch out, I just love Packard so much.   Seriously, go get this pie. It is amazing.  Oh, and they now have gluten free crust!",

This pizza is UNIQUE, INCREDIBLE & was a huge shock!  I live in New Jersey and there is no shortage of great pizza and different styles there and in NYC.   I have never had a type of pizza like at M&T. I can't really describe it well, but the dough Was light and crispy but not overdone. Thick but not like Chicago style.   Tremendously good. I got the McLovin (Mozzarella, Cheddar, Seasoned Beef, White Onion, sauce and sesame seed). Best pizza I've had in years and one of best ever. Also got their Woodward Ave White ( Mozzarella, Ricotta, Red Pepper Flake, Lemon Zest and garlic oil).   Run, don't walk to this pizza place. Great venue too. Evidently this is Detroit style pizza.

We have been searching everywhere for something similar and we have found it at Michigan & Trumbull!  The crust is crunchy and delicious, the sauce is on top of the cheese and tomato-y and perfectly sweet and tangy.  It's a little pricy, you get six small 3x3 cuts for 10$, plus 2-3$ per topping.  Specialty pizzas are 16$.  Two could share for a lunch portion.  It's definitely fancier than a regular pizza place, as are most of the other eateries housed in Federal Galley, some of the toppings include pickled onions and goat cheese, garbanzo beans etc. But that's what makes it stand out, you can always keep your toppings simple. It's a very popular lunch spot for good reason!",

It's almost like a pizza on a grilled cheese. The Woodward Ave white came with ricotta on top which was incredibly delicious and my personal favorite. We also ordered a salad with arugula to start and the vinaigrette was tangy and citrusy, a great starter for the pizza.   Service was wonderful and food was great!",

I searched Yelp for a place that I could walk to from my hotel, and Michigan & Trumbull has the best reviews.  The restaurant is one of four little places in Fort Street Galley.  The place has some character, and is well set up with clean wooden tables and water bottles and glasses available for free.  We had no trouble getting a table on a Saturday night.  I asked which combo was the best, and they said they were pretty much in order of popularity on the menu.  I didn't want pepperoni, so I got half Farnsworth funghi and half Woodward White.  While it's quite different from Chicago-style pizza, it was really good.  The crust is much more bready than Chicago style, with a lot less cheese.  Still, it was much better than New York style to me.  I really liked the toppings.  My friend got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and I liked his a lot less.  The white sauce seemed to work better.  I definitely recommend trying Michigan & Trumbull when in Detroit, especially for the white sauce pizzas.",

The menu was small with big flavors and a lot of focus on the dishes they where putting out. The crust was so buttery and crunchy and the sauce was a sweet red but not over powering sweet. The buffalo chicken was always a good go to with the perfect kick of spice and moist chicken along with fresh scallions. It's a bit pricey but well worth the splurge when you have a pizza craving.

Buffalo Chicken pizza and a Yinzer Salad (because you've got to eat your greens).  Well I'm happy to say that we left happy and full of delicious pizza.  Personally, I loved the crust.  It had the Sicilian crunch that I like for the crust -  crunch with the chew of tasty dough!  The drizzle of buffalo sauce on top make me salivate.  So many places put the buffalo sauce on first, then bake the pie.  That just makes it dry and have less of the buffalo kick.  M&T puts the buffalo on the chicken and the sauce on the pizza last.  Leaving that spicy tang for you to enjoy.  Yummy!  Now the Yinzer salad is not tiny.  It has delicious waffle fries with a BBQ chip flavoring to it.  So unique!.  The salad had arugula, bacon, cheddar cheese and ranch dressing.  It was tasty!  I actually put some of top of my Buffalo pizza.  Now that's a delicious bite!  We'll definitely stop by Federal Galley again for some pizza at Michigan &  Trumbull.  I mean where else can you get Detroit style pizza in Pittsburgh?",

Let me start by saying that buffalo chicken is one of the greatest combinations of food known to humankind. It's spicy. It's tender. It's tasty. It's great by itself and it's even better when you add it to literally ANYTHING.  So when I spotted M&T's buffalo chicken pizza on my Instagram feed, I quickly wiped the drool off my screen, phoned a friend, and made my way to Federal Galley for dinner.   Not that I thought it would, but this pizza did not disappoint.  It was the perfect amount of heat, the cheese was ooey and gooey and melty, the chicken was tender... and the crust.  THE CRUST.  I don't know what they do in that kitchen to make it the perfect mashup of crisp and fluffy... but they do it.  The owner herself stopped over to check on us and offered to bring us some homemade ranch to dip our 'za in.  Ummm yes please!   This particular pizza isn't on the regular menu just yet, but I liken it to what I call the \"McRib Effect\" - make something that people love, but don't make it available all the time.  Build that cult following.  And when it's time to resurrect the buffalo chicken pizza yet again, I'll be waiting with an empty stomach and extra napkins.",

    "text": "I am quickly becoming a fan of federal galley and Michigan & Trumbull is definitely my favorite concept there.   On my first visit I tried their mushroom pizza with goat cheese. It was so delicious! I loved the thick crust and earthy aromas.   On this latest visit I tried their featured pizza, the brinner. It had potatoes, breakfast sausage, and a ton of cheese. It honestly was one of the best pizza I have ever had. I also ordered their waffle fries, which were pretty tasty and well spiced; definitely the best fries out of all the restaurants at federal.   If you're having a craving from something sweet you should try one of their floats. I had one with red soda and it was delicious!  Also the service was great. The woman who took our order was incredibly helpful and friendly.  I can't wait to go back and try more of these amazing pizzas!",

    "text": "You can find better much better versions of Detroit-Style pizza.  I heard  the owners intend to open a sit-down restaurant by the same name but they'll have some stiff competition. Hopefully the experience at Fort Street Gallery helps them work out some bugs.  We had the Bagley Chorizo pizza and thought it was very overpriced for the size and flavor.  The chorizo was very dry and overcooked, having almost a sand texture.  The dough needed to be crispier on the sides and overall just wasn't that enjoyable.  Detroit is pizza paradise so we thought they will need to up their game if they hope to have long term success.",

And oh yeah, the crust.  Doughy, but not too soft.  Crisp on the edges.  Perfect.  And they let you have as many veggies as you want on the vegan pizza for free.  I had tomatoes, mushrooms and broccoli, and it was delicious.  If you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for??",

    "text": "I was at Federal Galley for a meet up and was compelled by 1) the hype about the pizza and 2) menu. The Farnsworth Funghi lured me. I'm a shroom fan.  Okay, so ordered, placed my number on the table and conversed. In no time a pan pizza arrived full of arugula and a liberal amount of goat cheese. At first bite, I tasted the lemon zest. Coupled with the arugula and mozzarella, it was an unexpectedly wonderful mix and balance of flavor. It didn't have as many mushrooms as the name suggested is my only qualm.  I ate half the pizza and took the rest back. Hubs devoured the other half when I got home. A pie became a dinner for two. That's your frame of reference.",

The honey added a tiny sweet touch to the pie. My father thought they were using a sweet sauce but it was actually just the drizzle of honey. The crust is amazing and seems to have cheese mixed in....creating this wonderful cheesy & crusty edges...yum!!! The only negative to this place is the high prices for such a small 6 piece pizza.",

    "text": "Sometimes I think that Pittsburgh doesn't deserve Detroit-style pizza, which is what Michigan & Trumbull serves.  I first found out about them at the Yelp event held at the Federal Galley. The Woodward White was love at first bite: exquisitely crispy caramelized cheesy edges, with toppings of mozzarella, ricotta, red pepper flake, lemon zest, and garlic oil. Trust me on the lemon zest--it absolutely works.  It's like my favorite light olive oil dressed pasta and a white pizza had a baby. A beautiful, crispy baby.  In fact, it's the only one of their pizzas that I order. I'm sure the others are lovely, but for me, I see no reason to stray from the Woodward White.  Anyway, this is also a great place to visit because there are several other neat offerings in the Federal Galley, so it's easy to go with others and each order from somewhere different, then share all around. The pizza is pretty substantial, so it would be difficult to eat one on your own unless you take leftovers anyway.    If they ever open a new location in Pittsburgh, I would love to see that!",

    "text": "YUM! Stopped in for lunch as this place was close to our hotel, and we were not disappointed.  We shared the Packard Pepperoni, and both loved it.  The taste is amazing, with a great blend between the traditional pizza flavors plus a little sweet from their hot honey, and heat from the honey and chiles.  The crust, of course, is the crispy cooked cheese that Detroit style pizza is known for.  I'm back home now, and miss this pizza.",
