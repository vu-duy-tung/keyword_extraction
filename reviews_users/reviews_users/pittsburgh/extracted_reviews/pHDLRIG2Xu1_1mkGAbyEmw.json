Even though they had just opened, the place was packed! And that's usually a good sign. We had to wait proably 20 min to get seated inside, but it was worth the wait. Our waitress came 2 min after being seated to offer water, the ordering was easy (we went for the $16 buffet breakfast) and the selection was really good. From smoked salmon, fruit salads, chicken and waffles to omelettes of your choice, I am sure you'll find something to brighten up your sunday morning! The staff was really nice and friendly, The buffet always kept with a decent amount of everything so we didn't have to wait at all. Everything that I had was of decent quality and for the price I really can't complain! Needless to say, I will definitely come back and try more.",

Plus, they've got a sweet outdoor patio for the warmer days.   Make sure to spend some time with the menu. It's a riot. Brilliant!",

However, when a local friend suggested we meet here he insisted Harris Grill's brunch was legit. He had me at \"bacon trough\".  Nice patio seating and friendly service! You get a frozen mimosa (and it's not overly sweet or weak; actually tastes like a frozen mimosa) or bloody mary with the $15 all you can eat brunch. Omelets made to order, lox and mini bagels, fresh fruit, trough of well done, really quality bacon as previously mentioned. There's even pre-assembled eggs benedict, which I expected to be a mess but they were perfect.   I wish all brunch buffets were like this. It is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates, but everyone was understanding and laughed off the occasional bumps. Brunch is serious business, you do what you gotta do.",

    "text": "A last minute cancellation afforded me the rare opportunity to have a weeknight dinner at a 'normal' person's time, so I decided to redeem one of my many (READ: TOO many) Groupons.   On the left: The \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezburgher?\" cooked to medium-rare perfection on the optional pretzel bun. A solid and above average burger for certain. Not quite on the level of Winghart's Burger & Whiskey Bar or Burgatory Bar, but also without the price tag that comes with those burgers. Head & tails above any burger I've had at Tessaro's!   On the right: The \"Kielrogieretzel Sliders\" - kielbasa, sauerkraut, whole grain mustard, and cheese-stuffed pierogi together in mini pretzel buns. Yeah, those were about as awesome as they sound, albiet alsightly overpriced for what you get. I think I've found a new place to add to the short rotation.   NOTE: Not pictured was the Cookies-N-Cream dessert, which in their words is: \"A freshly baked chocolate chip cookie of prodigious diameter served hot out of our Easy-Bake oven (powered by a 40-watt light bulb) in a lethal cast iron skillet with French vanilla ice cream. Give us a few minutes to make this: mom's baking these.\"  One of the better desserts I've had, so I devoured it before photographic evidence could be obtained.   If I needed any more evidence this place is kinda place, Tuesdays are 'Bacon Night'!  This was on a Wednesday around happy hour - atmosphere was chill, quiet, and relaxed. Service from Byron behind the bar was attentive without being overbearing. Nice people.",

Gave us a rundown of the highs and lows of the menu. If he didn't know about something (like a beer we asked about) he went, grabbed samples and came back fully knowledgable on them.   2. The outdoor seating is baller. They have a back area that is no smoking so you don't have to get a whiff of smoke in your face while enjoying the weather and eating. They also have creative seating upstairs. Awesome.  3. The food is DELISH! Try the rib tacos. They are sooooooo good. I've never had a bad meal here.  4. They have a sense of humor. Menu is fun to read.  Beers also aren't overpriced. WIN.",

They were just so tiny though.  Thank god for my white Russian to fill me up the rest of the way.

My boyfriend and I started out with the hummus and pita bread. I ate half of it before he had any! Oops! It was really great hummus!! I could have stopped here and been really happy, but I was hungry, so I ordered the mac and cheese and added grilled chicken. Oh holy cow!! This mac and cheese is cheesy, but not overly so. It's the perfect amount of gooey for mac and cheese. The chicken was seasoned, tender, and not dry. Great mac and cheese!!  I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Harris Grill!!",

That said, I counted only 3 dishes with any vegetables at all. The coffee was disappointing--it came with plastic cups of half & half. Any respectable restaurant should do better.  Overall, the food is good, heavy, and served in decent-sized portions. I would come here again although there are certainly better venues for brunch in the city.",

    "text": "Light your torches and get the pitchforks, because I'm not shy about writing scathing reviews on some of Pittsburgh's beloved restaurants. I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one.   I waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down.   I'll break it down.   DRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps \"aren't working.\"   APPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the \"Britney Spears\" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.  MAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos?   I don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between \"ok\" and \"good.\" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....  SERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service.   But truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.  Revising their menu wouldn't be a bad idea, either...",

This was back in the day when they had the brunch buffet style, which I guess meant we were always biased by quantity vs. quality. My last recent trip there left me kind of annoyed. We went there early before the crowds gathered so we got a nice spot. I asked for some suggestions from the menu and got blank stares. Eventually, I went with bacon wings. Terrible idea. I think I'm not going to have wings for at least a year. Or salt for that matter because the whole thing was fried in what appeared to be smoked salt. The wings came with two spoonfuls of scrambled eggs which luckily were not seasoned at all so that compensated a bit for the NaCl overdose from the wings.  I like  a fun menu but their pompous blurbs for each item (\"oh how creative we are\"  said in the hipstery ironic tone) should be followed with some actual information from the waiting staff!",

To me, it is know for MAC AND CHEESE.  I've sampled other things on the menu from the Britney Spears chicken tenders to the Shortrib Tacos. Don't get me wrong, they are delicious, but the Mac & Cheese is so good that I don't know if I can ever visit Harris without getting some. It is SO creamy and cheesy and they will make it custom with pretty much whatever you want. Onions? Mushrooms? Fried Egg? Tator tots? Yes. Please go get some.",

    "text": "A unique little spot with a quirky menu.   I usually frequent this place with friends or with my lifelong dining partner due to the fact that it's close to my workplace as well as my abode. I really go here just for the atmosphere at night. When I'm feeling lively, I'll choose to sit inside and let the thumping of the music and cacophony of voices take over as I indulge in my meal. However, during those off days where I just want a place for (somewhat) quiet contemplation, I'll decide on the outside patio. If the weather doesn't permit and I still want that solace, they also have a lounge with a fireplace directly above the bar. It really does have a place for any sort of mood.  The food is decent. Their menus do change quite frequently though, so it's best not to get *too* attached to a certain dish. One aspect that I love is how they name and describe their food. There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests.  Their drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails. My personal favorite would be the Happy Ending, which is a cucumber-mint based cocktail that entails the magic of vodka and a few other liquors. It's perfect for refreshing the palate between dishes.   Sadly, Harris Grill is a bit on the pricey side and the service is a tad inconsistent. But their unique menus and overall atmosphere is what keeps me coming back.   PS. Tuesday is bacon night aka free bacon!",

Most recently I stopped in on a Sunday, ordered our drinks then when it came time to order food we were given a long list of things they were out of. Including mac n cheese (a very big portion of their menu and half the reason we went in) Also out of fries, buffalo sauce, some of the burgers etc. I decided on a salad and was then told they didn't even have croutons ha. We got some queso which was good but the waitress never brought over the refill of chips that we asked for so half of that went to waste. The other bad experience was during brunch. We were seated upstairs then when our waitress came over she asked if we there there for drinks or brunch which I found odd given we were seated at a table, not that bar. Once we said brunch we were told they only have a brunch buffet on the first floor. I'm not lazy but I am clumsy so carrying plates of food up steps just is not ideal for anyone involved. We ordered a mimosa and left. The hostess should have asked us if we were eating when we came in, then gave us the option to wait for seating downstairs in my opinion. Out of 3 trips here, 2 have felt like a waste of money so that's why I'm giving 2 stars.",

Not so much that you get lost, but covers enough for everyone's taste....and it's full of jokes and hilarious descriptions.  Lots of comfort food, and tasty twists on classics.  They have a huge drink menu (...more like book) with lots of creative originals.  I had the Jamaican chicken mac special (the dish may have actually been titled \"Imagine the Rastabilities\").  The serving was huge, and the mac was awesome.  It was a bit too spicy for me (but still SO GOOD...worth the pain), but that's just my taste and I think it was a really cozy meal.",

The fun menus, nice staff, solid beer selection, and good food won't disappoint (and bacon night is always a plus) but there's very little that you can find at Harris that you can't get - or top - somewhere else. That's the primary reason that I'll rarely wait for a table when it's busy.  The mac & cheese is a standout, as many will tell you. Rich and creamy, with the cavatappi pasta being the difference...definitely a winner! As far as the food goes, I've never really had anything that I didn't like, but many items that I used to love are no long on the menu (pulled pork sliders being the main one, but the big sandwich is still there). Nowadays, I usually go for the fish tacos (good, but not a lot of fish on them) and the hummus, which is excellent. Henny Penny is another go-to, but be warned, as the spice levels have varied from time-to-time from so-so spicy to mouth-on-fire spicy.  If you're looking for a nice vibe in good weather, it's fun to try your luck landing a table on the patio. Service can occasionally be slow outside and it almost always gets crowded, but it definitely beats the inside when it gets packed. The only real downside is that it gets packed most nights, and as mentioned before, it's not really worth the wait. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I cannot speak to the merits of the cuisine here, but I will discuss the bar menu with which I was thoroughly satisfied.  Harris Grill features extensive outdoor seating arrangements, making for a pleasant visit on a summer afternoon. The draft beer selection is respectable and caters to a wide range of taste for craft brews. The bottled beer selection is likewise commendable and versatile. I like that there were enough options to please the palate of almost any beer drinker, but not so much as to weight the menu down with endless variations on the same style. Far too many establishments invest heavily in a quantitative selection that actually inhibits customers from trying a few quality beers by swamping them with a lengthy draft list. I would recommend Harris Grill for a casual beer with friends.  Cocktails: The \"Gods Swill\" cocktail menu at Harris Grill features a nice balance of classic cocktail variations and a few house blends with the emphasis rightly placed upon the former. I was pleased to find a half dozen variations of the manhattan, a cocktail of whiskey, wine, and bitters, that were each unique takes upon this staple of the American bar. I was disappointed in their \"Rye Mint Julep\" as, being from the south, I do not take to soda in my whiskey, particularly in a mint julep. The drink was watery and lacked the viscosity of a proper julep. I was impressed with the \"Chelsea Manhattan\" (served \"up\" after my experience with the julep) and would say that all considered, the Harris has a strong bartender. The cocktail menu itself is accurate if verbose.  The service was neither slow nor fast, with attention at the right moments and minimal interruptions. A great level of service for enjoying a few drinks. The food is by all appearances standard bar fare but who cares; the lord didn't give me a liver for eating. A very enjoyable bar and outdoor seating arrangement. Although I did not probe the wine selection, I would recommend the Harris Grill's bar to beer and cocktail enthusiast alike.",

    "text": "Let me tell you about my experience at the Harris Grill, I know I have eaten here before, years ago. So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar, first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky, then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \"Filth\" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ).  The restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle ) Let me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \"Oh\" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid.  \"PS\" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ...",

On a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.  She was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.  She return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.  Other waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.  We waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?",

    "text": "I eat at Harris' all the time.  I don't even MEAN to, I just happen to end up here a lot.  I think it's because it's the kind of place that lots of people can agree on - pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio.  For me, the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars.  in the winter they don't serve lunch.  In the summer this place is hoppin' all the time and yes, I'm that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up - they're just PARKING.  (speaking of parking - don't park in the lot next door you WILL get towed!)  None of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu - one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich.  I love it in slider form - get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando.  delish.  I don't even LIKE coleslaw - including on a primanti's bros sando - so you know it's good.  The mac and cheese (add the andouille sausage!) is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra.    Another new addition is the chicken fried bacon - yes, you read that correctly.  It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy.  I've shared it 3 times with friends and each time it's been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling.  I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon - which I also don't recommend - and I LOVE bacon.     Overall I love this place and I don't think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth - half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it.  Service is also usually great.",

    "text": "They tell me it's global warming; but, I just don't want to get into a scientific/political debate about this. All I'll say is if global warming means I get these beautiful nights in early November, I don't know what the big deal is. Ok, before I get flamed, I'll just continue with my review...  I was fortunate enough to eat at Harris Grill on a beautiful night in early November. The temperature was just about perfect for a fall night to eat out on their patio. The outside seating gives a really nice atmosphere to wind down after a long day at work. Now I know why people like coming here for Happy Hour. The inside has a nice lounge area, also good for getting to know your co-workers outside of the office structure. I give it a good solid 4 stars for the restaurant itself.  The food is okay too. I had the Lettuce Pray - seared tuna and grilled peppers with lettuce to wrap it all in. I liked it; it was a nice small snack to accompany my beer. I did enjoy the entertaining menu names. The beer selection is not that big, but they have an ok variety to choose from.  For the food, I'll give it 2.5 stars because, although it wasn't bad, it also wasn't anything to remember.   3 stars for Harris Grill. I would definitely recommend this place when you just want to go out on a casual fun night with friends. You can grab a drink, order something to nosh on, but you're really there to enjoy the company.",

    "text": "1 of 5 stars  Nice outdoor patio, great beer selection, cool old house, but in general the venue is kind of dirty, and our server was seriously on overdrive, running about all herky jerky spouting his funky hipster spiel a mile a minute. Ordered a $12 Caesar salad; menu description included the ingredients buried in some lengthy weird non-description that referenced Caligula.  Wow!  How did they know that CALIGULA was exactly who I wanted to envision as I ate my meal.  Caesar salad arrived: romaine lettuce, institutional croutons, sprinkle of parm cheese, teaspoon of dressing. Hmmm. Asked the waiter where the chicken was. He noted that he \"forgot to ask if we wanted it added\". It's no wonder, the poor chap, as we had to wade through the Caligula verbiage to point out that it was supposed to come WITH chicken (not sure why they didn't pull out all the stops and make a reference to teenage hooker Iris in Taxi Driver too. Caligula and A LITTLE BIT OF CHICKEN! Har de har har! Ain't I clever?) Anyway, the menu leaves one with the impression that its author might have been hyped up on any myriad of mind altering substances, and thought themselves to be oh so cheeky. But what the heck, right? To each his own. Apparently somebody likes the place as reflected by the positive reviews, but in my humble opinion our food was lack luster, our server could have used some Chamomile tea (hey, was his name Fire Marshall Bill?), and their menu was so tedious, ugh, I'll never return.....even if I want to know \"Where do babies come from\".  That's the menu title for sliders. Yup SLIDERS. Ya want some MAYO with that?!  Har de har har AGAIN!!!  I'm so funny right? RIGHT???    P.S.  Can I just order some FOOD please?  For the love of Pete.",

It was the go to place for large groups and a small catch-up with a friend. The frozen cosmos with a shot of chambourd is AMAZING.  4 bucks between 4:30 and 6:30.   YUM!  2 of those and you won't notice if the service is slow or not! I think the food is great and I love the upstairs view and the patio out in front.  The one time I had a less than stellar meal, my waitress removed it from the bill with no hassle. I will always stay an advocate of Harris.  It is a happy place for me!",

    "text": "My husband and I tried Harris Grill for the first time on a Sunday night. We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June, and unfortunately decided we won't be coming back here before we leave.   There was only one very small table open in the crammed dining room downstairs when we got there. I'm not sure if there were tables open upstairs, but it didn't look like the hostess checked before seating us. Our table was facing the door, so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out, and we were very close to the table behind us, beside us, etc. We eventually asked to move, but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up.  I thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich, but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese, there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me, so I ended up ordering the \"Henny Penny,\" a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came, the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy, but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that, so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken, which was nice, and it was fine after that. I also had the sangria, which sounded like it would be amazing from the description, but I actually didn't think it was good at all :( It tasted really watered down to me.   A few redeeming things: the mac & cheese that came with my sandwich was really, really good! My husband liked the fish tacos he had, and three different people checked up on me after the incident with my sandwich, so we at least felt like the staff was pretty attentive.",

    "text": "I frequent Harris Grill quite often. Whenever we need a place in walking distance I always pick them over all the other high priced or mediocre Shadyside restaurant/bars. Their menu changes seasonally and is always hilarious (more so than Mad Mex, which they poke fun at along with other local restaurants). They're surprisingly vegetarian friendly for the amount of meat they have on their menu. I have not had anything here that wasn't delicious; favorites will come and go, but I'm a fan of their HUGE salads and the eggplant lasagna (noodle free).   Absolutely go for brunch - Sundays 10 to 2. It will either be a buffet or a menu for a fixed price of $13. VERY meat heavy, but I'm sure there is always something veggie-friendly, but never expect vegan-friendly. They include two drinks and a fresh fruit plate - one of the drinks can be a bloody mary (which we got and regretted, it was very unpalatable) or a frozen mimosa (get that instead).   What I really love, aside from the fantastic food, is the creative cocktails. These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth. Service is usually either chipper and delightful or just barely okay. We don't come here for the service or the dim lights - we go for a good meal and you should too.",

My most recent trip was this past Saturday (1/23/10).  I was hoping that the unseasonably warm weather would make for good outdoor dining on their awesome patio (I'm pretty sure they were voted near the top for outdoor dining in one of the local Pittsburgh magazines) however, the rest of my party nixed that idea.  My usual order includes the mini pulled-pork sandwiches (swine & dandies), the mini crab cake sandwiches (crabby-patties), a side of the macaroni and cheese (I defy you to find better mac & cheese in Pittsburgh) and the buffalo wing dip.  I would highly recommend any of these dishes.  This trip, I tried the pierogies for the first time.  They were decent, although they seemed a little overcooked on the outside (too much time in the frying pan).  I also had the full sized pulled pork sandwich and a side of the aforementioned mac & cheese.  As usual, these were great.    I definitely recommend giving this place a try.  As other reviewers said, the frozen Cosmo's are great, and definitely add the shot.  For beer drinkers, their prices are somewhere between fair and overpriced, but they have a very large selection of unique bottled beers.",

Granted, everything I've had there is good (pierogies, chicken breasts named \"Nice Breasts\", Turkey Burgher), but not overly spectacular.   The beer menu, however, is inspired.  These guys stock more unique beers like Omegang Hennepin and Victory Ales that are not usually on most bar menus in town.

Having said that...Harris Grill left a taste in my mouth that wasn't the pink urinal puck...it was of the fine Belgian Ale on tap (a clean tap with ample choices from Troeg to Belgian seasonals) and the half-price wings that were keeping me sweaty on the chilly September Pittsburgh patio. Harris Grill goes down as the first place I fully enjoyed a wing sauce that wasn't Buffalo...their Jamaican Jerk made me boogie.   The pulled pork and slaw was traditional, which I appreciated.   Forgo the thought you'll park close to Harris...it's tucked in a great neighborhood...embrace the walk. Embrace the heat of the wings. Embrace what local joints in Pittsburgh have to offer.",

Harris Grill does brunch and spicy bloody marys right. The service during Sunday Brunch can be a bit slow..but aren't we all after a good night out?",

    "text": "Really fun place to go, especially if you have a sense of humor and enjoy good food.  I've been here twice and never been disappointed.  Their menu descriptions change periodically, as if one of their staff members got a degree in comedy writing but hasn't made his/her big break yet.  It's always fun reading the menu for the quirky stories that poke fun at CMU students or current events or what have you.  Menu content aside.  I've never been disappointed with the food.  The fish tacos are definitely an excellent bang for the buck, at under $10 (maybe under $9 but I don't recall exactly) and comes with a side of your choice.  The spinach dip is delicious but just a tad too cheesy for me.  I had one of their pasta dishes a long time ago, loaded with chicken and vegetables, which was one of their pricier items, but it was a large dish so I was able to eat it the next day.  Also, if you're not driving, please try their dessert drinks.  Or at least read the menu for it.  You'd have to splurge a little, but they're still worth a try.  For those not interested in dessert drinks or mixed drinks, the beer selection is decent here, too.  Overall, I like coming here.  It's kind of like entering a house, with the various seating areas -- tables if you like (inside or outside), or couches if you prefer to lounge around.  The lighting is dim but warm.  Music is contemporary and lively.  It's a great place for young people.",

    "text": "I have to say that I became a Harris convert very early on. I moved a few blocks down on Maryland and this became my mainstay while in Shadyside. This is bar far the hippest restaurant in Shadyside, and it has just enough quirk and a nice clientele to keep my faith in the typically snooty Shadyside goers. The food here is great- with possibly the coolest menu in the city- and a few good vegetarian options to boot. The hummus is good, and the vegetarian chili is incredible. The beer selection and unique cocktails, while a bit expensive, are extensive. And leave room for dessert- the ice cream covered cookie thing is to die for, especially after a couple of drinks. The bartenders are great (except for a douchebag that I believe has recently left). Harris boasts maybe the best brunch with amazing mimosas along with the buffet. In the summer months there is a chef that makes your omelettes however you want them right in front of you. Try the frozen cozmos- I have had some crazy nights off of those.",

I've usually stuck to the Baby Burgher Platter. Burgers are really tasty and just hit the spot. It's not like having a huge burger, but I've never found myself wanting more. Tonight, I think they had some new fries out. Massive improvement over the old ones!  I've never ordered the entree mac and cheese, but it makes for a tasty side. My sister had the Henny Penny sandwich. Just know....it's spicy as all hell. We thought my sister was going to explode. She couldn't finish it. So, if that's your thing, go for it but be prepared. The Pulled Pork sandwich was also a hit with my family.  As for desserts....they have root beer floats. And that's enough for me. Do they take any skill? No none at all. Is it still wonderful to see one pop up on a menu? Oh yes.  Service has always been very efficient and polite, no complaints or rude servers. Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark and loud for my tastes. Patio usually fills up, but if you set up near the big windows, it's almost the same thing but with AC.  And they're open late (1:30) which is a huge plus for Pittsburgh. Definitely think I'll spend some more time there.",

I've been to all sorts of places, pubs, restaurants, cities and tried variations of the Henny Penny and this is the ultimate in blackened chicken sandwiches.    Overall, I really like the vibe of this place.  It's totally unpretentious although it's in a very prententious part of the city.  The crowd is usually laid back and it's a great place to hang out with some friends, grab some drinks, and eat some killer food.  So what are you waiting for, get yourself a Henny Penny!",

I thoroughly enjoy Tuesday Bacon nights (where they give out baskets of bacon at the bar or you can get them to your table for a buck) and any and all swag from the tap takeovers they host.  It's a good Shadyside crowd and full of familiar faces that don't suck to chat with. Their mac & cheese is crave worthy, as are the pulled pork sliders and the calamari.  Their menu is fun to read and has something for everyone and the atmosphere is relaxed and cozy.  The bar area gets a little crowded for happy hour but whatever, I like it and the big front patio in the warmer months is so clutch.

    "text": "5-star drinks, 2 star food.  Let's start with the bad. The food here is just all kinds of disappointing. First of all, their labyrinth of a menu. I understand that they are trying to be cute and witty by concealing the item descriptions within paragraph-long stories and forcing you to read them due to the completely nonsensical names they give to said items. I truly understand the concept behind this. But can I be the first to say...IT'S NOT CUTE! For the drink menu, fine. I'll admit to having a few laughs at their PG-13 drink encyclopedia. I'm not that cold-hearted. But when I'm hungry, the last thing I want to do is spend 20 minutes trying to decipher what my options are.  Clearly I have a vendetta against their obnoxious menu, but the real problem here is that the food is the definition of mediocre. I go here fairly often, so I've done a lot of hopping around their menu trying to build my go-to order. I still haven't figured it out, and it's at the point where if my friends want to grab food here, I'll make a point out of eating beforehand. Plus, oh WOW is this place overpriced! This was especially highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to $42 for brunch. Not expensive, but the wheels started turning in my head...we just paid $42 for an appetizer, two entrees, and two bloodys, all of which were eh, passable. For exactly $6 more, we could have went down the street to Casbah and had TWO appetizers, two entrees, and two much stronger bloodys, all of much higher quality.  The reason I still come here though is the drinks. My favorite is the Happy Ending which involves pineapple juice, ginger, and cucumber. You really can't go wrong with anything though except for the Statutory Grape--if the name doesn't dissuade you enough, just heed my advice and don't order it. Unless of course, you want to have flashbacks to that time you attempted to robotrip on Dimetapp in middle school. Memories!  It's official, I am done with the food at Harris Grill. Drinks only!!",

    "text": "Harris Grill is a decent place to head to in Shadyside.  The drinks are well-made and the tap selection is nice.  The atmosphere is great and the crowd is hip.  The food, however, has disappointed me on multiple occasions.    Harris is on a nice little section of Ellsworth with a big outdoor deck in front and back.  They're great places to chill out on a summer day.  The inside is nicely decorated and has several levels.    The drinks here are good.  Apparently the frozen cosmo is great, but anything with \"frozen\" in the name isn't my sort of thing.  The tap selection is constantly rotating.  Happy hour here is great, with cheap beers and wings.  It's one of my favorites in the city.  And of course, no review can go without a mention of Tuesday night, where free bacon is served with drinks!  The food, I'm sad to report, is pretty mediocre though.  Not that they're not trying to have interesting things on the menu, but it all just ends up not being that great.  The prix fixe brunch is similar.  The menu is pretty hilarious, but the food usually disappoints.  The exception is the wings - which do have great sauces, especially the strawberry chipotle BBQ.  The service, however, is very good, as are the bartenders.  BOTTOM LINE:  Go here, but stick to the drinks or wings.  It's a fun place with a great atmosphere and happy hour.  Prices are moderate and pretty standard for Shadyside.",

The menu was fun and the food was perfect.  I went with one of her recommendations and ordered the Delmonico A Go Go, which will now be the high standard that every sandwich I eat from this day on will probably be measured against.  The bread by itself would have been delicious but then it was piled with quality toppings -  steak, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and swiss cheese.  I then followed her recommendation to get the tots as my side...and I know what you're thinking tots are tots...but now they are the perfect little crispy side dish to an already perfect entree.

From creative drinks to an entertaining menu to multiple different events per week, it seems like you'd rarely get bored here. Having only been twice, I am not sure if the food is as unmemorable as some other reviews say, but we personally enjoyed both dining experiences, one as a Sunday brunch buffet and the other a late night dinner. The star of the brunch for us was the eggs Benedict as well as the hash station, and we found ourselves refilling several times.   For our second visit we ordered tacos and a pork shank special. Both came with vegetables that were grilled nicely--some were pretty much burnt on the outside but those were easy to take out, and the rest was super flavorful. The tacos had a crispy tortilla shell and ample fillings, but the pork shank stole the show. Lots of tender meat and super tasty. It was also huge and was more than worth its price.  Service was a bit slow but it's understandable. Having multiple levels so that you can choose to be farther away from the bar was definitely nice.",

    "text": "It's time for an update, as promised, since I revisited Harris Grill the weekend before last.  This time, I came with CM and a friend of his for dinner, instead of late night drinks and snacks.  Although we came at prime time (around 7:00pm on a Sat.), unlike my last visit, it wasn't crowded at all, which was probably due to the snowy/cold weather.  This time, instead of being seated at one of the cramped tables next to the staircase, we were seated at a prime corner table upstairs with a great view of Ellsworth Ave.  Between these factors, our visit was off to a good start.  After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the pork shank special ($17), and CM ordered the jerk chicken tacos ($12).  Additionally, as promised, I ordered the large mac and cheese again to split, to which we decided to add bacon ($13).  CM's friend went with the turkey burger ($9), which came with fries.  Upon being served, my pork shank entree looked quite impressive, impaled with a knife and surrounded by steamed veggies and some mashed potatoes.  When I tried it, however, it tasted like something from a chain restaurant--meaning that while it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly special, either.  I didn't try CM's jerk chicken tacos, but he seemed to enjoy them, and I didn't ask his friend what he thought of the turkey burger, so I can't offer an opinion on those items.  As for the mac and cheese, this version was better than the version I'd had previously.  This time, it had an acceptable amount of cheese (although it would have been improved by even more...), and the bacon added some savory depth to the flavor.  As before, it came sprinkled with bread crumbs underneath the bacon, which gave it some extra crunch (as mentioned previously, I enjoy bread crumbs on my macaroni).  However, some of the noodles were a bit burnt (see photo)--perhaps this was due to toasting the bacon and bread crumbs on top?  Overall, while this was an improvement over the prior version of this dish I had here, it was only okay to good, failing to crack the top echelon of PGH mac and cheeses (score: 7.0/10).  Service was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not super attentive, but there when we needed it.  The check for CM and I came to around $50, which seemed steep for the quality of the food received.  Fortunately, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked off $10, but even so, with tip, we still almost cracked the $50 mark.  Taking everything into account, I'd be willing to return for Happy Hour or Bacon Night, but I doubt I'd return for (regular priced) dinner, since the quality:price ratio was lower than I'd like, and there are many other options in the area. 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "I've been frequenting Harris Grill for a few years now and it typically doesn't disappoint. Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order \"Britney Spears\"? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.  Anyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their \"church basement pierogies.\" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.  The downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.",

    "text": "This was close to one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. The single star was solely because my food was delicious. Let's just start by saying that on a Tuesday at 11:30pm the restaurant was moderately busy but at the end of a the dinner rush. We were greeted and promptly seated on the first floor on the other side of the wall from the bar. We sat for a moment until our server came to ask us what we wanted to drink, we told her we were still looking at the menu, to which she returned about 10 minutes later. After placing our drink order (a bourbon peach spritzer, a whisky tango foxtrot, and vodka double), it took at least 20 minutes to receive our beverages. Being in the industry myself, I totally understand being in the weeds and then having to make specialty drinks which can be a couple steps between muddling, pouring, straining, etc. However, I watched the drinks sit in the well while we sat at our table waiting. Mine was good, however the foxtrot was absolutely awful. Between being strong and outstandingly tart it was extremely unsatisfying. One of our friends joined, and another 15 minutes to get his drink (a vodka red bull). We ordered food, which was also a slight wait, but nothing we didn't expect at the end of the night, however we ordered bacon and spinach dip as an appetizer and got it with our meal so we sat hungry until our food finally came. As we were eating, my boyfriend who had ordered a dish that was supposed to have bacon on it did not receive his bacon, but the waitress came so few and far between we just decided to let it go since we had our bacon basket anyways. It was 10 minutes until midnight, to celebrate my birthday, we ordered a round of fireball, which we did not receive until 10 minutes after midnight. I was ready for a second drink, and was nervous to try another specialty drink, so I ordered a double peach and tea which is what my friend was drinking at the table with me, thee bartender came back and said they were out of peach, no problem I'll take citrus and sprite, she came back to the table again asking what flavor I said? Mandarin? Sure, just pour a drink whatever is fine. When she came back, 15 minutes later, my friend at the table asked her twice for another drink (vodka red bull) and she ignored him twice...but 15 minutes later brought him a drink. The over all experience was so mediocre which was a shame because I spoke very highly of the restaurant to my friends who had never been. Our waitress was so unfriendly it was almost rude and was only attentive when it was time to cash out like she was waiting to leave. Sad because I love coming for brunch, but am not sure we will ever be back.",

None of the dishes are named anything useful, so you end up having to dig for what each dish actually is, not to mention the price. I gave up after the first page and just looked at yelp pictures to figure out what to order. Maybe if I wasn't so hangry it would have been somewhat funny...  The food was okay, I got the chicken wings with strawberry chipotle sauce, about $7.50 for 6 wings. They were fine, nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got the grilled salmon salad for $14, again, fine. I feel like this summarizes my hand-full of experiences here. Nothing on the menu is that cool or daring, and the prices are rather high for traditional bar food.  The best part of my meal was the bloody mary ($7), and I've never been disappointed in my drinks, but I don't think I'll be spending any more money on food. I also wish the cocktails had prices on the menu. Service is always great, and I've never had to wait for a table. Maybe I'll check out bacon night and they'll win me back.",

The mac n' cheese is brilliant, especially the lobster mac! Well worth the $20+ price tag! The last time I went, I switched it up and got a braised beef quesadilla that was amazing! We also shared the hush piggies and oh my goodness! I could have made a meal on those alone!!!! Cheesy..bacony! They are soo good! The only issue I ever have with going there is the menu. It annoys me to no end...I just want to know what's in the food! Some of the descriptions are literally just clever anecdotes with no discussion of a single ingredient. But, ya know, if i order it and it tastes as good as everything I've tried, I'll leave that up to the peanut allergy folks and veggie haters to be upset! Me, I'll continue searching for context clues and taking gambles!!!",

    "text": "We start with the most important factor of this bar: BACON!  I was here this past Thursday for Happy Hour, for a beyond needed break from studying for my Supply Chain final. The decor is quaint from the first Barstool to the Bathroom [apparently the men's bathroom is a must-see. I will take my friend's word for it] During the warmer months, the outdoor patio area is a great section to soak up from sunshine or enjoy Brunch.   Our happy hour special was great. Do make a point to arrange a group outing here, we offerings are more than accommodating. You cannot pass on the frozen margaritas or one of the craft beer selections.  There is a range of half off appetizers, do a must with the Pierogies. I am so glad that they are still served with the grilled onions and are the non-baked versions that have replaced the originals on so many menus. [You can never go wrong with grilled onions]  Now to return to my first point: This is the only place I know of that has Bacon Night. Every Tuesday [and for us on Thursdays] come to the Bar and snack on strips and strips of delicious pig dripping in its own greasiness. In all shades of burnt eat them on their own or wrap them in their also delicious spinach dip, with or without ketchup/hot sauce/bbq sauce whatever you can get your hands on.  Harris Grill Sunday Brunch is a must, the menu is sassy and clever indulged with witty sayings and includes a drink for an ever low price of $14. I cannot wait for it to get warmer to come back.  The service is amazing, considering we are even greedier with our beers than we are with our bacon. Make sure to tip well and come often.",

We arrived around 10:30am and were seated right away. The waitress came over and stated that the only option was the buffet and there was no menu. She then walked away without giving us any more information or room to ask questions. We decided to go for it, but when we went downstairs there were only a few options to eat. The hashbrowns, Eggs Benedict, and tatertot casserole were all almost gone. The pancakes looked good, but it was taking so long to wait for one that we decided it wasn't worth it. The only redeeming quality about this brunch was the frozen mimosa that came with our meal. If this buffet had been around $8 I would have been okay with this, but $17 for this mediocre food was just not acceptable.",

We were in a booth upstairs that the middle leaf was taken out so it could be two tables instead of three. The other people on the other side left shortly after we got there, thank God, or else we would have been facing each other.   We started off with a plate of Mac and Cheese to share. Delish. Then I had the Pgh Salad and Chris got the Burger. The salad was good but it wasn't anything special. The salad had more of the crunchy iceberg lettuce than the other mixed greens so eh...   The burger was really good. I had a bite and I kinda wanted to trade meals! He got mashed potatoes instead of the fries, and that was a great choice.   So maybe Harris Grill will get another chance after it redeemed itself yesterday. All I have to remember is to not order a salad.",

    "text": "This is the spot to be on a Tuesday night and I can sum up the reason in one word: \"bacon\". That's right, every Tuesday is bacon night at the Harris Grill and it's amazing! I mean who doesn't like bacon? And it's even better when it's free bacon!  You don't even have to ask. It's just brought out in baskets and placed in front of you. All the bacon you can eat. What a brilliant concept! A bar wants to sell beer so why not offer something that's salty and chewy and would make you want to drink more?    Oh, and the beer selection isn't all that bad either. I had a Founders Centennial IPA and a Philly Kilty Pleasure. Both paired perfectly with the bacon.  The service was spot on too... although the place was pretty crowded, I got my first beer within a minute of being there and my second beer within a minute of finishing my first. This was all accomplished while the bartender was keeping a steady stream of bacon baskets flowing from the kitchen to the bar. I was with a group of eight others and when it came time for us to leave, the bartender printed out our checks and, without even asking, every one of our checks were correct. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised at this but I think it's pretty amazing how one person can orchestrate all this, making it look so easy and keeping a pleasant demeanor with a smile on his face.   On top of a great gimmick, good beer and fantastic service, I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the atmosphere. There's seating out doors for the warmer months. The building looks like it was a house at one time that got converted into a bar/restaurant. There's an elegant staircase heading to the second floor, a fire place giving it a nice cozy touch and there's a number of knick knacks throughout. You just feel comfortable being there.  I need to make note to stop by sometime and try one of their \"Build-A-Bowl Workshops\" for dinner.",

The buffet contained a salad, chef tended omelette station, egg's Benedict, boneless chicken fingers and waffles, potatoes with peppers and onions, bacon, sausage, and bagels with toppings like smoked salmon.   My omelette was really good and made well. I also liked the potato mix and found the bacon to be made at the perfect crispy level - though you had to dig for it as there were a lot of fatty pieces. The Benedict and the chicken and waffles were really basic - literally plain chicken fingers (great stand alone option if you brings kids I guess) and plain waffles.   For the price though you can't beat it and both of the free drink options were good. There is a nice bricked patio out front. And our waitress was really nice. She kept checking on us, she was super friendly, and when she accidentally dropped a knife near one of us when she was clearing a table she gave him a free drink. Proactive and full of smiles.   A neat place to keep in mind if you are in the neighborhood. I had no wait for a table for 4 on a holiday weekend.",

There were red flags from the moment we walked in when they stressed that there were no substitutions of any kind allowed, and they had to check with the kitchen to see if they could leave cheese out of a dish that was being ordered by my lactose intolerant friend. Seriously? You had to check that?  The service was friendly, but very slow.  My friend ordered a veggie omlette that arrived in a lake of yellow grease. It was inedible. By the time we FINALLY got the waitress's attention to have her take it back and order plain eggs, she warned us that the kitchen was super backed-up and it would be a very long time for a replacement order. Not ok. The food took another half hour to arrive, at which point, we were no longer hungry. And it tasted mediocre at best.  Highlight: fresh squeezed orange juice included in the price of brunch.

Though I'm told others have had better luck our server was forgetful and many jokes were made to explain time and time again why no bacon had appeared. I'd say skip the bacon night. Other wise the turkey burger I had was affordable and tasty with a salad on the side. I had an organic Oatmeal ale that I would recommend. The menu was humorous and others at my table were also pleased with their food. It's a step up from standard bar food and not greasy which is a +. The interior was dark- too dark for my tastes unless your on a date and after that mood. Outside was nice- they ran out of seating shortly after we arrived and several people stood around us, but again, maybe this was an effect of bacon night. Enjoyable enough.

We were seated upstairs at a great table upstairs facing ellseworth.  The view was great watching many of my fellow burghers' imbibe on a windy Sunday afternoon.  The positive experience ended here.  Well, maybe except for the humorous menu that made me smile.  The waitress was so below average, you know the type... she is doing you a favor by taking your order.  I had the pierogies appetizer which was flavorless potato filling served in a overcooked pasta shell served in vegetable oil with maybe one or two slices of onions.  Come on!  This is Pittsburgh. You should be ashamed.  Then another server brought my burger and I made the unforgivable mistake of asking her to grab me another beer.  Sorry, I know you are not the one who took my order, but you are bringing my food.  I've made this mistake before and usually the person says \"okay, I'll let your server know\", not \"Ummmm, I'm not serving you,, you'll have to talk to your server\".  Funny, I thought you might run into each other in the back.  Anyways, the burger was close to inedible burnt to a crisp resembled a hockey puck.  We also tried the hummus which was pretty good.  I ordered a kettle one with cranberry and was brought absolut.  Friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad.  They both said they were pretty good, if not a little dry.  Then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our bill.  If they executed the food well and had at least average service I'd be back, however they don't and I won't.",

Love love love the drinks and love the bartenders- but as far as the food- no more- to add insult to injury- I actually just got back on Yelp to add this- we waited for our check for 20 minutes and the table next to us sat waiting to have their order taken until they went downstairs to ask if someone was going to come up- no- they didn't rush up- they came up 5 minutes later. Terrible terrible service- super disappointed!!!!!",

    "text": "How have I NOT reviewed Harris Grill yet!?  I am embarrassed to admit how many times I have been here. Actually, I probably couldn't even figure it out if I tried.  This is a top happy hour spot amongst my friends. You just can't beat the $3 frozen cosmo deal. I can't say I'm usually a fan of bright pink slushy drinks, but a post-work frozen cosmo (or three) on the patio on a warm day? Yes, please.   That being said, we come here a lot in the warmer months as there is always outdoor seating availability. The inside isn't bad either but you have to take advantage of the nice weather when you can!   As far as food, Harris has a selection of 1/2 price apps during happy hour--a good option to soak up some of those cosmos. I've had a number of entree items as well, my favorite being the \"Imagine the Rastabilities\" (spicy Jamaican jerk pulled chicken mac and cheese). I'm also a fan of the jerk-style tacos and the (oh so classic) Pittsburgh salad. I can't think of anything from here that I haven't enjoyed.  Service isn't terrible, but not the best. We've had mixed experiences. Some of the waiters and waitresses are extremely attentive and friendly, and others not so much. One time it took nearly an hour to get our checks. We actually had to send a member of our party into the restaurant to find someone who could print the checks for us. Right before we left, a manager was coming around to check on tables, and we expressed our frustration to her. She was wonderful about the situation and gave us vouchers for a free entree on our next visit. As a frequent visitor, I really appreciated that she was receptive to our concerns and didn't try to make excuses. I very rarely complain but there was no reason for this kind of hold-up.  Overall, one of the best Shadyside happy hour spots. I'm already looking forward to spring so that I can sip some cosmos and unwind outside!",

You can either sit out front or hide away in the inside OR sit at the bar with giant TV's that usually have on something more interesting than the latest game, sometimes Discovery Channel or Animal Planet.  The food is a little pricey but the quality justifies the cost.  The mac and cheese is amazing and made fresh there.  The presentation and plating felt high end but the place is very casual.  Rumor is Tuesday night is all you can eat bacon night, I'll have to make it for that.  If you go or it's another day, let me know!  Tellem HITTofMCM sent ya!",

    "text": "After the woeful Stillers game vs. Tampa, we did some Yelping to figure out where to go.  Hey 'Burgh...what's up with all your decent establishments being closed on a Sunday?  Harris Grill wasn't, and we're certainly thankful for that.  This review should actually reflect 4.5 or 4.75 stars if possible- just a neat place.  We ventured over and found parking without issue.  I can imagine on a Friday or Sat evening this might be a little more challenging.  Since it was a beautiful fall evening, we opted to sit outside and we were approached quickly by our waitress with water, and asked for a moment to review the hysterical drink menu.  Much props to a place that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just read the menu and if you have an ounce of humor in your body, you should at least salts (smile a little then stop).  I salt because LOL is so yesterday.  I opted for the manly Sangria, which was outstanding, and she got some lemonade concoction with vodka.  Both were hits.  We also read a lot about the hummus, so we were followers and went with it...very pleased we did.  A great appetizer.  She went with the skirt steak mac n cheese.  I went with the lobster and crab mac.  I'm just going to laugh at my kids when I make them microwave mac n cheese from here forward.  THIS is mac n cheese- it's creamy and fattening and has a crunchy topping and soft noodles (but not too soft) and well...it's perfect.  There were generous portions of lobster and crab in my dish and it was delish.  Her steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I was almost jealous I didn't get it, but then I'd grab a huge hunk of seafood and quickly realize the mistake of my ways.  Both are very rich dishes.  If you can finish the big plate of mac, God bless you---you're a better person than I am.  However, it does make for a wonderful breakfast.  Don't judge me.    She finished with a dessert type drink that featured Rumchatta and strawberries- not my thing (said the guy who ordered Sangria), but she enjoyed it.  Dessert looked tempting, but the button on my jeans was already stressed, and not wanting to hold my pants up on the walk back to the car, I shook off the waitress and asked for the check.  If memory serves, 3 drinks, an app and 2 fine dinners came to roughly $75 plus tip, so, roughly $90....and if I lived there, I'd do it at least once a month or more.  The menu is diverse (and funny).  The service is timely and I saw a manager deal with a couple 'difficult' customers in a way that I'd want my manager to treat any customer.  Pittsburgh's lucky to have this place.  When we're back in town, we'll be going here again.",

    "text": "Things I love about the Harris Grill.   Outdoor seating.  Great place for summertime/fall time drinks and dinner.  Upstairs couch seating. I always like the comfy atmosphere.   Food. Most selections are always really good. Burgers, hummus, spinach dip. They always have a good rotating menu with seasonal apps and entrees. One I love that used to be a regular and returns at times is the Rita Hayworth and the Pork Shank Redemption. Most delicious pork shank!   Happy hour is good with deals on apps and drinks. Beware the frozen Cosmo. While quite delish, get a driver. I swear to you I had two one night and had to stay at a friend's house up the street.   Things I don't love.  My only disappointment as of late are the seasonal drink features and a lot of the cocktail prices. I had a black walnut Manhattan and while it was very good, it was not $12 good. Prices are never listed for the drinks and they should be.   To end on a positive, my service has always been great here. It can get quite busy and snotty at times from the customers who feel entitled to their neighborhood and the hosts/hostesses take the brunt of that. They are really accommodating and very diplomatic dealing with the shittiness of some of the customers. That cannot be easy! Bartenders and servers have always been on top of service even during the busiest of nights.",

I've been too many times to count for both food and drinks, and the service there is relliably great.  Paul G. is the best bartender!  Food-wise, you can't go wrong with the jamaican tacos, thanksgiving in Blawnox turkey burger, the Tots. The salads are all solid too.  In the summertime, the small back patio is the best seat in the house.    I agree with other reviewers that the mixed drinks are a little pricey and that the prices should be listed on the drink menu.

    "text": "I normally love this place for happy hour but I had a terrible customer service experience when I stopped by yesterday. I came in during a time when the front patio was packed with people, but there was one open table. I walked in and asked the hostess (not sure her name but she had pink hair) if I could be seated out there. She said okay and that she would run out and clean it up for us. Immediately after, a lady started telling the same hostess that it was freezing upstairs and that she wanted to be moved outside. This lady said, \"I know she just asked you for that table outside, but I would like it.\" She said that right in front of my face! I couldn't believe it. I don't know what made this snob think she was entitled to that table over me, but I was even more surprised when the hostess said okay, also right in front of my face. And then when the lady walked back upstairs, the hostess really just said \"yeah I can't give you that table anymore\" as if I hadn't witnessed her just pass it off to someone else. I was so stunned. I decided to forget about it though and sat down at the bar with my friend. A few minutes later, I went back over to the hostess and asked if she could at least seat us at the next open table. She looked really annoyed when I asked and informed me that in the 5 minutes it took for me to ask, a waitlist for tables outside had formed and I was #3 on the list. I was shocked that she wouldn't move us to the top considering she gave my table away right in front of my face. Well we were there for almost 2 hours and were never moved outside. Let me say that I completely understand that it was busy and I was okay with sitting inside, but I still cannot believe I was treated that way.  UPDATE: I still get upset about this all the time. It didn't help that the lady was a rich looking white woman while my friend and I are people of color. Even if the hostess wasn't thinking about color/class at all, you can all still imagine how the whole ordeal made us feel.",

For $3 at happy hour, you seriously cannot beat this price. They are incredibly strong, so I always say no to the extra shot of Cassis, but if you are feeling adventurous, it's only $1 more for the extra shot! Anytime friends come to visit from out of town, they ask if we can please go get some frozen cosmos. Apparently I talk about them a lot...  Frozen cosmos aside, the food is actually pretty good as well. I really enjoy the turkey burger filled with cranberry stuffing as well as the upstate chicken riggies. This is definitely Western PA chicken, piggie, wedding riggie gone very very right. I love the combination of vodka sauce with fresh bell peppers. And who doesn't like tots on the side? Brings me back to my childhood, stealing tots from friends at school whose parents let them buy their lunches.  This is the perfect place to go with friends. Go in the spring, summer, or fall when it's nice enough to sit outside on the patio, kick back with a few fro cos, and enjoy friends. You won't be disappointed.",

I wasn't a super fan of the food, but I think that has more to do with my taste-buds than the quality of the food.  My boyfriend went crazy for the Mac & Cheese with beef.  I don't think the plate lasted longer than 5 minutes on the table.  We, however, long overstayed our welcome and we didn't get any nasty looks from either our waitress or any other waiters.

There was a little less meat, and a little too much bread, but overall, flavorful and well balanced with the different ingredients. I did a side of mac&cheese for a little uncharge. *Delicious! I would definitely recommend it. Next time, I am trying a mac&cheese with chicken or seafood. Something fun. The tater tot appetizer (with gravy and cheese curds) was a unique twist on regular tater tots. The gravy was yummy, and melted cheese is always a win! The tater tots were crispy. The spinach dip was not a win for me. My friend loved it; however, I had one pita bread chip with a scoop, and that was more than enough. It tasted way too much like spinach (and not in a good way).  My friend ordered the For carnitas, you can't beat us sandwich. He loved it. I had a bite, and must admit that the sandwich was tender and had some flavor. He ordered the chili as his side, and said that was some of the best vegetarian chili he's had before (he ate the whole thing in 6 bites).",

    "text": "I remember when the food at the Harris Grill was just meh and the interior hadn't been updated in God knows how long.  Suddenly, they have a bacon night, the interior is hipster chic and the food has been significantly upgraded.  I just recently went there again this past Saturday with my daughter Muff and my sister Luch and we had a pig-out moment. There is no good reason why three people should order entrees and several appetizers for lunch, but we did that.  My sister and I ordered the Salmon BLTs. (She tried to be healthy by ordering a side salad with her sandwich, but I went all the way in by ordering the fries to go with!)  Muff ordered the \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezburger?\" and tatter tots. (Muff could only finish half of burger since we got the appetizers too.) We also ordered the Hush Piggies, which are home-made tatter tots with bacon and cheddar cheese (What's wrong with that?) and Chimichurri Flurry wings.  (Those wings were delightful and delicious!  I usually ask that my wings be fried on the hard side, but they instinctively knew that's the best way to serve them.)    We also ordered the Cookies-N-Cream dessert which is a hot chocolate cookie served in a small cast iron pan with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce.  I'm not really a dessert person, but I have to say that that warm chocolate chip cookie with the ice cream was tasty.  Go on Harris Grill, you have stepped up your game!   It's nice when an older restaurant in a quote, unquote \"chic\" neighborhood decides to do a remix of their space and menu.  That has been the death knell of many established restaurants. (I miss Eddie's Restaurant in the Hill District for a good old-fashioned soul food breakfast.  However, I don't think that they renovated the place since Van Gogh had both ears.)  Harris Grill did a nice update and should be rewarded by having more customers come through their doors.",

Sometimes, we will get someone really friendly and attentive but other times the server will appear annoyed. Food wise, everything tastes good...depending on who is working in the kitchen that day. Just as an example, the spinach dip (which I've gotten before and loved) was watery and salty this time and when we mentioned it to the waitress she said \"oh, it's probably because of who is in the kitchen today...\"   However, the cocktails are creative and tasty (albeit a tad expensive not during happy hour) and happy hour is fun - especially when you can sit out on the patio on a nice day. I'll definitely continue coming back but I'm wary about the inconsistency of the food.",

If you like wine, go on Wednesdays! I am definitely a wine fan and have experienced their $6 Wine Wednesdays. And let me tell you, this $6 glass of wine is more like a $6 LARGE pour of wine that would probably be worthy of 2 glasses.   If you like bacon - go on Tuesdays! I am not a bacon fan, but I have heard that they serve free bacon on Tuesdays! I will definitely have to take my sister her on a Tuesday. It will for sure become her favorite restaurant in town!",

I don't know if it's the absurdly worded menu, Tuesday bacon night where the bacon is actually free and unlimited at the bar, or the fact that they'll put anything you want in your mac 'n cheese, but I am enamored with Harris Grill. The draft list doesn't hurt either and service has always been great.  If you're looking for a fun and hip-but-not-very-hipster new American joint, you've found the spot.

The service at the bar was very speedy; we each had 2 drinks served to us and our tab closed out just in time for our table.  When we were seated, we immediately had waters brought to us and our appetizer order taken. We ordered the cheese curds and we loved them!! I was hesitant that they might be really heavily fried and make me feel kind of gross, but they were surprisingly light and the sauce that came with them was excellent (it reminded me of a tangy honey mustard almost).   For our entrees, I ordered the eggplant lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the Thanksgiving sandwich.  My lasagna was perfect! I was worried that it might be soggy, but it was very crispy! My boyfriend actually ended up with a turkey burger, and we aren't sure if it was maybe the way he ordered it that threw them off or if they just brought him the wrong meal. We did not bother even mentioning it though, and he still really enjoyed his burger.  I definitely give their menu credit for being so creative (both with dishes and names of the dishes). I have dined here twice before and also had very good experiences both times. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was excited to finally get to try Harris Grill for brunch. My friend enjoys this place a lot, and the last time we tried to visit they only had a brunch buffet. I have a love/hate relationship with buffet, which is mostly hate, and generally would prefer to order a la carte.   We were in luck because brunch was a la carte style at the time of our visit.   So one cool feature of their brunch was that the brunch entrees came with a drink. According to the menu, it included a frozen mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Our waitress also informed us that we also had the option of a draft beer. My husband and I decided to split the 2014 Mad Elf and the Mongo Double IPA. She later informed us that the 12 oz drafts didn't count as a brunch drinks, however would still count it this time since it was her mistake.   Their brunch menu isn't listed online so I'm writing this off of memory. There was this pierogi lasagna dish that just stood out. Now that's my type of hybrid. It wasn't made with pierogi's, but consisted of pierogi ingredients combined with lasagna. Super tasty, but kind of small. It came with a house salad, although the salad wasn't listed on the menu, nor did the waitress ask for a dressing preference. We realized the dish was so small and had a salad to fill up the plate, because it was off the brunch menu. I mean $14 for a drink and entree, I guess you can't expect a huge portion. It's tasty but just not huge.  In addition to the pierogi lasagna, I split the breakfast mac and cheese with my friend. The portion was exceptional and I loved every last bite I got. In addition to their traditional mac and cheese, the breakfast mac and cheese also included bacon and sausage. For an extra $1, we got an extra fried egg. Our server forgot to write up the fried egg but was able to put in the order quickly after we received our food. The mac and cheese was super creamy and especially awesome with the breakfast meats.   I like that Harris Grill has humor. The menu is sarcastically funny. There's even a joke at the bottom of the receipt.   In honor of their 10th anniversary, they were giving away little cups of M&Ms.  They even had the M&Ms personalized for Harris Grill. Nice touch.   I'd go for a 3.5 star rating if possible. There were the few service issues noted above and I wasn't thrilled with the size of the brunch dish. Since our server made up for any mistakes and the price was right, I'm going to round up to a 4.   I would certainly go back to Harris Grill next time I'm back in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Just as an update, we went back to Harris Grill (Shadyside) last night after about 6 months of totally taking it off of our rotation.  Honestly, we had three free food vouchers from the last horrible experience, so that's the only reason we decided to try again and see if they got the \"kinks\" worked out.  The answer is definitely not.  We thought it was actually worse.  The food itself was good.  Other than the fries being cold, which we just dealt with, everything was good.  I'm not sure if the server was just new, or completely in the wrong line of work, but we sat at 7:15, got greeted at 7:30, got our drinks at 7:45 (and they were just Diet Cokes), and our food a little after 8:30.  There were three of us.  We didn't end up leaving until around 9:15, and not by choice.  No one was apologetic (3 different people came to our table at some point), when he never gave us the condiments we asked for, we just ate our food and mentioned it to him when he finally came back, and his response was that at least we got our meals.  It's really hard in my book to justify complaining about free food, but all three of us unanimously agreed that we would have rather paid for food elsewhere than felt trapped in that place for the length of time we were.    On a side note, since the food itself was actually good, if you're like a lot of people and this is really where you and your friends are going to spend your entire evening and have some drinks and what not, you might not have any problem with this particular place.  We were just stopping in for dinner and then heading elsewhere, so two hours for a couple of chicken sandwiches was just not what we had anticipated for the night.",

The Mac and Cheese, while cheesily delicious was cold. They kept running out of plates. They never had the salmon when I went up- yet I saw it on other patrons plates.  And, insult to injury, my Bloody Mary was watered down. My friend had a Bloody Mary and the olive in it tasted like chlorine.   I will give props to the guy making the omelets.

It brought me back to life with two stellar Bloody Marys (they were half-price!), a salad topped with locally made cheese curds (absolutely perfect, even for a shaky stomach) and hot, crispy wings (not half-price but so tasty I ordered seconds anyway).   The restaurant was slow so it was nice and quiet while my Advil settled in. The bartender was on the water refills like a hawk, but was chill enough to leave me and my dining companion in peace while we ate (it is impossible to overvalue an observant bartender).     The menu descriptions are on the rambling side but that's okay because they're pretty funny. And I wouldn't be a competent reviewer if I didn't mention that every Tuesday the bars are lined with baskets of free bacon. You read that right--bacon is their bar snack.  They have a huge outdoor seating area that I plan on taking advantage of late into Pittsburgh's warm summer nights--they're open until 2 a.m. every day except Sunday.",

That's right, every Tuesday night bacon is served at the bar as soon as happy hour ends. The best part is that it's free! If you can, try to go a little before 6:30pm to enjoy the last of their happy hour specials right before they start serving bacon. They have a nice selection of beer along with an extensive seasonal cocktail list (definitely recommend trying the frozen cosmo!) and a wide variety of wines. I enjoy coming here when the weather is nice and sitting out on their front patio.  I have only been here for happy hour and bacon night and have had the Spinach dip and Buffalo chicken dip. Both are great to snack on while drinking with friends.  Fun place to get together with friends for drinks and a few laughs.",

    "text": "Mmm not too happy with my recent experience at Harris grill. I visit Ellsworth ave plenty and I have been to Harris grill on numerous occasions. After working all day, and driving 2 hours to get home I was a little grumpy and wanting a good drink.  My two friends and I decided on the sangria. I've had it on numerous occasions and it can really hit the spot. The waiter suggested the caraf but HB warned us saying that they stuff it full of ice. The waiter insured us we would get around a glass and a half. We bypassed HB and ordered the caraf. Upon arrival we knew it was no bueno! The caraf was heaping full of fruit on the top followed by way too much ice. Our serving glasses also were heaped with the stuff even though we had asked for lite ice. I asked the waiter to pour for us bc I knew sangria was going everywhere. We ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail. We all told the waiter that it was pretty awful but he did nothing to correct the insult. Never ever order the caraf!!  To eat I had the pulled pork sandwhich and a side of mac n cheese. The flavor of the pulled pork was good and the pasta was delish. I will say the pork had some fatty bites that I didn't care for. All in all when the start of  a dining experience starts the way ours did it can be salvaged with the right customer care. Ours wasn't plain and simple.",

Decided to try out their Sunday brunch at loved it. $16 for buffet-style brunch, which includes your first drink. (I recommend the frozen mimosa!) The buffet had a solid variety of quality eats - chicken & waffles (together or separate), bagels & lox, made-to-order omelets, salad, fruit salad, potatoes, eggs, benedict, bacon, sausage...great food and great value. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I went here last night with my \"man-friend\" around 9:00ish to get some grub.  We were starving so we were a bit disappointed that it was a 30-45 minute wait but it was a friday night.  We perused the drink list (it is a bit confusing because it looks like a facebook page) but settled on a MOFOjito and a margarita.  The MOFOjito (mojito with pomegranate) and the marg were served in pint glasses which was a surprise but so was the $20 tab for both of them. My \"man-friend\" was appalled (he is normally an IC Light kinda guy).  After we waited by the very dimly lit bar for about 45 minutes the hostess sat us at a table in the downstairs portion of the restaurant (basically right next to where we were standing.)   I started off with the veggie chili which was hearty and filling. It was topped with sour cream and served with a pita chip...delish.  I also ordered a spinach salad which the server explained to me is now different from what's on the menu.  Something about no strawberries, crumbled blue cheese, spiced pecans... It was definitely a change for the WORSE. The salad came out looking rather lonely with sliced almonds, 4 orange slices and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  It was sooooo bland. The dressing was just straight up balsamic vinegar.  Not only was it bland but it was tiny (almost looked like a side salad for $9.50). My date got the 'Salad a la pittsburgh' he wasn't thrilled by it either. His was much bigger than my salad and came with chicken (i think it was $1.00 more).   We didn't get alcoholic drinks with dinner and our bill was $29.00 which isn't that much more than our bar tab for 2 drinks.   Pros: Lively, fireplace when you walk in the door, a bunch of vegetarian options, big drink list,   Cons: Pricey drinks, very dark inside, sub-par salads, \"funny\" menu ( you have to read the whole description to figure out each item, I understand how lazy that sounds but witty names are only good once in a while)  Overall: Might go go back and not get a salad.  The beer selection looked promising.",

    "text": "Harris Grill is excellent if the weather is nice and there's a table on the patio.  The atmosphere inside is super bro-y.  Bring a group if you're going inside.  Their food is decent for a bar--I wouldn't go there for dinner, but for a bite with drinks, it's more than fine.  The mac & cheese goes great with beer.  I have a love/hate relationship with their craft beer selection.  I love it because it's a nicely curated selection and there's always something I want to try.  I hate it because the beer I want is often kicked.  In fact, I once went to Harris only to find they had ZERO draft beers available that weekend night.  Zero.  The place was empty save about four regulars, so it would have been smart for them to offer an impromptu discount on something else--instead, the bartender was angry when we asked if they really were out of all drafts.  Boo that.",

It was in a small area and felt kind of cramped. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and didn't look appetizing. My friends ordered orange juice and each glass was filled to the brim with large pieces of ice, which means that they really just had maybe 1/2 a glass of orange juice. In all, it's really nothing special, just very basic. It was my first time eating at Harris Grill. What seems nice is the patio and if the weather had been nice, we would've sat outside and maybe I would've given it an extra star.",

Many things went wrong during my most recent brunch experience which include them running out of plates for the buffet and not being able to replenish the food fast enough.  Once you waited for the food to be replenished (about 10-15 minutes) it was just average. The buffet had an omelet station, mac and cheese, waffles, potatoes, bacon, bagels, fruit and salad. I was disappointed that they did not have any pastry items.  I recommend going for happy hour as they have discounted draft beers and frozen cosmos-their specialty and they are delicious!  The food is normally excellent so I recommend trying this place for lunch or dinner.  If you want to try the brunch I suggest visiting during the winter when it is not a buffet and you can order off the menu. The frozen mimosas are so tasty!",

    "text": "I was in town for a job interview (in Moon Township) and decided to venture into the city the evening before.  Here's the run-down based on this one visit: Food:  I was half (or more) starved by the time I got there.  I ordered the veggie chili and it was quite tasty and the Philly Cheesesteak.  The cheesesteak was \"hearty\" and quite generous but given the size (and calories) I doubt I'd order it again.  I ended up taking it back to the hotel (for what I thought would have been a midnight snack but did not happen).  If I happened to be in the area and in the mood for a cheesesteak, I'd head back; otherwise I'd not bother.   Service:  It was \"blah.\".  I could tell my waitress had a rough day and it was a bit crowded that evening (a Monday night) but she just didn't seem all that friendly (perhaps at least she could have faked it I suppose).   Parking:  I live in the Los Angeles area where parking issues are a way of life but Shadyside parking is unbelievably complicated.  (or I just don't know the insider tricks just yet)  Unless I lived in the area or there was relatively easy public transport to this otherwise very charming neighborhood, I'd never recommend heading there for a simple meal.",

    "text": "I haven't been home to Pittsburgh for a while and I was really excited to get out and explore the food scene. Although Harris Grill wouldn't have been my first pick (I try to stay away from the preppy Shadyside scene), I was pleasantly surprised by  the atmosphere, food and service!  I really enjoyed indoor atmosphere that mixed trendy decor with dim, sexy lighting. Our server was excellent and kept the drinks coming and I was extremely impressed by their craft beer selection. And I would certainly come back to enjoy their expansive outdoor patio.  I got to sample a lot of different selections. We started with the Dippo de Queso con Carne, which was a spicy mix of chilies, cheese and chorizo. Served with pita bread, it was good but there are better things on the menu. And onto those, the Baby Burgers were delectable as were the 'Britney Spears' (I swear that's the real name). The Britney Spears were marinated and skewered chicken that was served with some zesty chipolte sauce and rich pesto.   After all of this I probably would have given 3 stars. HOWEVER, the Mac & Cheese was excellent and as a connoisseur of mac-n-cheese, I know my stuff.  What topped off this meal was the incredible Eggplant Lasagna (Lasagne Aubergine) that I shared with a friend. Now, I'm not one to ever order anything that doesn't have meat in it. But I would truly go back to Harris Grill JUST FOR THE EGGPLANT LASAGNA. The eggplant was breaded and fried and layered with pesto, marinara, and layers of delicious cheese. I would highly recommend this dish to anyone, whether you're a vegetarian or not.  And I will certainly be going back just to check out their bacon night.",

Star 2 - the menu; not only does it provide entertainment value, but its eclectic choice of fare goes above typical bar food  Star 3 - happy hour specials; are amazing -- maybe I say this because I come from Boston where there are no happy hour drink specials  Star 4 - good mix of people here; from medical residents to hipsters, everyone frequents this place.  at least from what I've seen.    Downsides: waiting for outdoor seating; smokers outside",

The paintings on the walls have nuns and monks drinking and have a very artistic and fun vibe amongst the random gargoyle statues beside them! The menu is fun and is presented in a very comedic tone. They have an appetizer called \"Britney Spears\", so right there I'm a fan of the restaurant! The food is so fun and yummy! I always get the \"Thanksgiving in Blawnox\" burger, which includes turkey, cranberries, sage stuffing, and a wonderful rosemary aioli! Yum! Just thinking about me has me ready to go tomorrow! I also ordered the Henny Penny chicken sandwich, which was a little too \"black\" (burnt) for me. The service has always been good and the ambiance is always pretty much there! Sometimes, on a busy night, you feel like you're on top of the table beside you, but with food like Harris', it doesn't even matter!",

Some of the wait staff are super friendly, but the main barman is roided up, snappish, and generally deeply unpleasant to interact with. You'll get the real measure of this place by reading the pathetically sexist, misogynist menu - this is the kind of bar that thinks that 1950s-era sexist jokes make the menu sound edgy and modern. Utterly and irredeemably classless, the kind of place that wouldn't survive a month anywhere in the northeast other than Pittsburgh.",

He ordered the steak mac and cheese and I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. We also ordered one of their speciality cocktails, can't remember the name but it was one made for the summer season and for dessert we got the cookies-n-cream, which is a cookie baked and served on a cast iron skillet with vanilla ice-cream on top. We enjoyed our meals. They give a good portion of Mac and cheese. I was happy to see that they weren't stingy on the lobster like how a lot of places are when they offer lobster mixed with something. The cocktails were also good; light and refreshing. The cookie was warm, gooey, and delicious. We were seated outside. The seating was crowded for my taste, but it was a busy summer day so I get it. Our waiter, Rambo (that's really what his name tag read) was nice and actually took the time to converse with my boyfriend about our recent move to Shadyside. In all honesty, I'm not sure I'd order the lobster mac and cheese again given the price. It was really good, but I'm a tough critic when it comes to lobster mac and cheese (i've had lobster mac and cheese that transcends you into the heavens with every bite you take and at a cheaper price). Once I become better acquainted with the other items on the menu and with dinning in the area I may consider updating my review.",

I get the Ceaser salad frequently and also the macaroni and cheese and it is always top of the line. The \"f-bomb\" martini will satisfy any taste buds as it is always done right. The arugula steak salad is always a great choice and I could go on! Also be sure to visit its sister restaurant Shiloh on Mount Washington!",

I ordered a glass of Merlot ($6) and their new roasted vegetable salad served with a side of fig dressing. For some reason or another, my glass of wine took 10 minutes to arrive. No apology from the server, but whatever she appeared to be the only person working outside. My salad was very yummy. Too bad the portion wasn't a tad bigger. I could have eaten the roasted veggies, especially the broccoli all afternoon.",

The food and drinks are moderately priced, and there is a nice selection of brews.  What we had:  Turkey Burger-fabulous-we agreed this was the best thing we had ( I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good)  Flat Iron Pork-I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak-this was ok but I wouldn't get it again.  Some Spicy Chicken sandwich-Pretty good-paled in comparison to the turkey burger  Tots-Delicious  Beer-good! (duh)  Other: Service-Fab!  2 Patios-front and back",

    "text": "Harris Grill is, hands down, one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Yes, it's in Shadyside, which I usually avoid at all costs, but I never have a problem making an exception for this spot.  I don't think I've ever had something on the menu that I didn't fall in love with.  My husband and I are huge fans of the 'goat in a boat' (cheese and pepper dip served with yummy hot pita triangles), but there's nothing more satisfying after a few rounds of drinks than their baby burghers and horseradish mashed potatoes.  Speaking of drinks, they have one of the most extensive mixed drink lists in the city.  If you find conversation with your dinner mates a bit dull, you can just page through the 'Grill Swill' menu for a few good laughs, and even some conversation starters.  I love the 'Surly Temple,' and my husband prides himself on sampling each and every type of Manhattan they offer.  Harris Grill is home to some of the best bartenders in the city (and also one of the hottest ;).  Tuesday night at the Grill is Bacon Night, which means you can get unlimited (until they run out) bacon.  It's free in a basket at the bar, or $1 per basket at your table.  And if that's not enough bacon for you, they've even got bacon-tinis.  Yep, bacon, in booze form.  It's every Yinzer's dream.  Their other booze specialty is the frozen cosmo, which is like a Slushee version of the original.  It's good, but as a girl who can't even do frozen margaritas, I seem to get a brain freeze every time I try one, and usually wind up sticking to the classic version, which is always perfectly mixed.  Lately, I've been getting their chicken salads there, Pittsburgh style, with crispy fries on top.  There is something about their ranch dressing there that is just amazing.  See previous comment, re: everything here tastes like heaven.  In nice weather, you can sit on their patio and put in some serious people-watching.  It gets crowded on the weekends, but all the more opportunity!  There are a lot of stairs at this place, and let me just say: drunk people trying not to fall down stairs... well, they're funny.  :)   And the best part about Harris Grill?  You can hang out there without any of the Shadyside rubbing off on you.  So go forth, and bacon away :)",

The buffalo chicken dip disappeared within minutes as it was better than any buffallo chicken dip any of us have had at a restaurant.  The seasonal cocktail menu was also great- I had the rum spiced cider and a pumpkin pie cocktail.  To top it off, one of the people in our group has a severe nut/bean allergy, and the entire staff was very accommodating in making sure no nuts or beans touched our food. Will come back again for sure.",

The macaroni was quite good. I also tried the potato and cheese pierogies (around $7.50), which I liked, but it was my first time trying pierogies, so I can't compare them to anything.  The waitstaff was quite pleasant.  The restaurant was noisy, so possibly not the best place for people who are hard of hearing.",

The only things I've had that I've not liked were the frozen cosmo and the turkey burger.  Everything else I've had - burgers, sliders, french toast brunch plate, both buffalo and spinach dips, eggplant lasagna, hummus...I'd recommend it all.    Tonight I got the white chicken chili ((cuz I was feeling a bit chilly myself)) and the calamari appetizer to share with NOBODY!    Ok, my husband had a few bites, but after I tasted the first piece, I moved it back over to my side of the table.  I realize that they probably just drizzled it with sweet and sour sauce but it was fried to perfection then sweet and sour and just ohsogood.  Simple, but perfect.   The chili was very good as well.  My husband had the Delmonico sandwich and mac n' cheese side which he was quite pleased with as well.  I had a bite of the mac n' cheese.  Very tasty!  And Tuesday is bacon night!  What more could you want in a bar?",

Tuesday is bacon night where you can get a basket of bacon appetizer for cheap and it's okay.

My friend and I split the \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezeburger\" and an order of Mac and Cheese.  The total for this was about $12.50 with tax each. The burger was good but not special.  There was more bacon on the burger than most places, but it was not the star of the meal.  The mac and cheese, however, was fantastic.  The portion was quite large, and our awesome waiter brought us some Sriracha, which was a great addition!  There was lots of rich cheese sauce, which was extra yummy on our french fries.  This is one of the top mac and cheeses I have had in Pittsburgh.  The place is a bit dark, and even on a Wednesday night, most people were already toasted at 6 PM.  The witty menu is fun to read while waiting for food as well.  Parking can be challenging on Ellsworth so be prepared to walk a bit.",

If the fireplace doesn't warm you up try a cocktail or two. There's a great list of wines, beers, cocktails, and signature specials.   Recently, a small group of friends and I experienced their Sunday brunch for the first time. We definitely intend to go back! The brunch menu itself is fun to read, so give yourself time to read it in its entirety. Its clever and quirky descriptions of menu items makes picking just one thing to eat that much more difficult. We solved that issue by each ordering a different menu item, and then sharing. Remember, sharing is caring when dining out. How else do you expect to sample a wide variety of foods in just one sitting?   The portions were generous, to say the least. The brunch included a Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or a fresh squeezed orange juice; coffee or tea, a fruit cup, and one brunch entree. Needless to say we had a to-go box or two by the end of the meal.   Did you know Harris Grille is on NoWait? Grab a spot in line before leaving your house from your phone.",

    "text": "Updating my review because I recently came to Harris grill for brunch, for the first time! It was amazing!  It was a gorgeous spring morning and I wanted to get out of my house and go somewhere awesome for brunch, with a patio. I tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and I agreed on Harris. I checked in on the \"no wait\" app when leaving my house (a 40 minute wait was estimated), drove the 20 minute drive to Harris and was seated right away! We sat on the patio, of course, which was such gorgeous.   The brunch at Harris is a buffet- which I had no idea about until arriving. It was only $15 and included your choice of juice, a frozen mimosa or a bloody mary. I went with the frozen mimosa (duh)! It was delicious and had a nice kick of alcohol to it, which I loved ;)! The buffet was pretty impressive! Eggs benedict, chicken tenders and waffles, omelets made to order, bacon, sausage, bagels with all of the fixings, fresh fruit, potatoes and sauteed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but everything else was AWESOME. I loved the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after. The sausage was also very good. My boyfriend and I were also in love with the potatoes.   For $15 a person, we were stuffed and very satisfied. I didn't think I could love Harris Grill more than I already did, but coming to brunch proved me wrong!",

My only thing was that I was looking for more of a lighter salad with the vegetable salad but it's actually a big size and could be more for a filling meal. Served over greens it had Brussels sprouts, carrots, potatoes, broccoli, onions, peppers, and a fig vinaigrette. Overall very good and the service was perfect too!",

    "text": "Bobby and I stopped here for dinner on Saturday to celebrate his birthday as well as the anniversary of him dealing with me for 3 years (ha-ha)  For drinks, Bobby ordered a long island (you probably could've guessed that though) & I ordered a glass of sangria (The original. They also had pumpkin sangria). He didn't enjoy his drink too much and i offered for him to try mine because it was delish! Wow, they make an amazing sangria! Bobby also enjoyed it, so we ordered a carafe of this delicious-ness.  For dinner, Bobby ordered the Thanksgiving burger. It's a turkey burger with cranberry stuffing inside. It sounded really tasty! I almost thought about ordering it before he brought it up. He originally ordered the November throwback of a pork shank, however, someone from the kitchen came upstairs to inform us that it was defrosting since they didn't think another person would order it. It would've been an extra 15-20 minutes which is why he decided on the turkey burger. For his side, he ordered the Mac & Cheese.  For my dinner, I ordered the ever so popular Henny Penny and a side of \"smashed\" potatoes. The server informed me that the chicken sandwich was a little spicy. I honestly thought i could handle it, and for the most part i did.. but i honestly couldn't finish the last half. It was just so spicy even water wasn't helping. Bobby ended up finishing my other half of sandwich and he gave me his mac&cheese. PS- the mac&cheese is delicious and sooooooo creamy!   For dessert, we ordered \"The wrongest dessert ever\" (Please see picture to see why it was given this name.) The dessert was on their November throwback menu and consisted of a fried twinkie, two scoops of vanilla ice cream with a raspberry sauce (maybe chocolate sauce as well).. complete with whip cream. I loved it and i don't even care if you judge me for the calorie intake that i took in at this restaurant. I have full intentions on heading back before November is over to enjoy that dessert again!",

    "text": "I can't properly review the food or beverage selections since I never actually got seated.  I came as part of a large group, who specifically chose Harris Grill because it could handle a crowd.  When we arrived, the lounge area--clearly designed to seat 15-20 people--was occupied by precisely two individuals.  That's right, two people leisurely sipping drinks.  The host informed us when we entered that they would be leaving soon.  Half an hour later, they had ordered another drink and seemed to be making small talk with the host: clearly a friend of theirs.  This begs the question: why on earth would a host seat two people in their party section?  I came up with two possible answers.  1. The restaurant hates money 2. They hired the worst host in Pittsburgh  I'll be returning to Harris Grill sometime this month to try their food, all of which looked and smelled amazing as it whisked past me on plates destined for tables.  In response to the comment below, I wrote this review to call attention to a business practice which seems mutually detrimental to both the restaurant and the customer.  I don't hold grudges and I'm willing to treat the experience as a one-off.",

    "text": "Wow, what a nice little spot on Ellsworth in Shadyside. I drove down Ellsworth with the intent of stopping at one of the establishments in the cluster of restaurants/bars around Harris Grill. And the thing that caught my eye about Harris was the romantic patio set up they have which is unbelievablely awesome.  The whole entire patio area they have outside is definitely one of the best in the city. I sat down with my date on the patio, which is perfectly lit up for a night spent eating outside, ordered some whiskey drink, while she ordered a glass of wine and we ordered the goat cheese appetizer. Harris has a healthy selection of cocktails, beer, and wine, just like Shiloh does, which is perfectly alright by me.   The Goat cheese appetizer is served cold with warm pieces of pita. The actual cheese was very rich and was good to pick at, I don't see how only two people could finish it, we couldn't. It's just very filling.  For my entree I went with the Jamaican chicken tacos, and they were absolutely perfect. The spicy chicken was cooled off nicely by a cold cilantro sauce that was drizzled over each taco. Mois Bien.   The only reason I'm not giving Harris 5 stars is because all of our food was brought out at the same time!!   GODDDD!!! Come on server!   That's why there are appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  You wouldn't bring someone's dessert out with their meal, so why bring out their appetizer with their entree, especially on a date!!!",

    "text": "This place is going downhill fast. I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off, our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF.   Anyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen.   They were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING.   I got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.  The bacon \"baskets\" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck.   Overall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate. The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios, cleverly written menu, and nice location on Ellsworth ave. Oh, and a lot of condescending d-bags, if you're into that kinda thing.",

The walk to the hostess is a bit awkward as you're walking through the front patio full of guests already enjoying their meal.  That not really being an issue, you'll step into the 'foyer' where you're greeted and offered various seating options.  We were escorted upstairs to a cute dining area with large windows and a very charming ambiance.  We were seated and not shortly after were greeted by our server... 'Shipwreck'.  Yeah, I'm not kidding... He said his name was \"Shipwreck\", even after questioning him... this set the tone for the night.  He was very knowledgeable of both the liquor and food menus and was jolly, and appeared to really love his job; Attentive and courteous as well as entertaining.  The food was amazing!  When you go, if you're like me, you'll be snapping photos of the names they have come up with for the array of 'American Cuisine'.  Things like the \"spin spin sugar' Salad, or the \"Aw, you're pullin' my pork\" pork sandwich.  Everything was geared toward putting a smile on my face; and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Next time I visit Pittsburgh; I'm definitely stopping in again.  Probably one of the most memorable dinners out in a while!  Thank you.",

    "text": "Deck seating during Happy Hour gets a big thumbs up from me.  I personally prefer the frozen cosmo without chambord--it's sweet enough.  At three bucks during Happy Hour, I don't care that the frozen cosmo looks ultra girly pink.  I also had an East End smoked beer, that was completely vegetarian, even though it might not have tasted that way.  The food's decent here.  The pasta in the macaroni and cheese was cooked perfectly--not too mushy.  The sauce was rich, though I might have liked some toasted breadcrumbs for a crunchy contrast.  The bread that came with the spinach dip, though, was too hard.  The food is more three-star worthy, but the deck and Happy Hour drink specials bump the overall rating to four.  I can't complain about the service here.  They treated us fine even though we were a large group, and you know how large groups can be kind of pesky because we're not terribly coordinated when it comes to ordering and all that.  They even gave us separate checks without complaint.  The gratuity was already included, which was okay by me--it's just a lot more convenient having my own bill instead of trying to figure out my share from one communal bill.  Gentlemen, I'm told the urinals in the men's room are \"interesting.\"",

Both of my visits were for the Pittsburgh Bacon Bash and of course I ate tons of bacon things, but I also grabbed a few items from the amazing menu of humorously-named entrees and appetizers.  My favorite app was the bacon chicken wings which were lightly battered and bathed in BaconSalt and then topped with crumbled bacon awesomeness.  With a big bacon bloody mary, it's the perfect meal!   I also had The Central Park, The Old Fashioned, Hog Heaven, the Bacontini, a few cosmos of greatness and a lot of great local beer!  For such a small place the beer options are great.  While the prices were a bit high ($12+ for some of the drinks) compared to anything near me, the quality and quantity both make it worth the bucks!    I also played \"What's Up, Pussycat\" on the jukebox 10 times in a row and made a lot of people laugh hysterically!",

They mac-n-cheese dishes are delicious and so are their burgers (my favorite used to be their sliders but unfortunately they removed them from their recent menu). The ambiance is also great for both winter and summer (they have outdoor patios), while the service has always been friendly and useful.  I am sure I will be visiting Harris Grill quiet a few more times in the future! A good choice if you find yourself on Elseworth or Shadyside in general.",

    "text": "Harris Grill is great during happy hour and OK during all other times. I used to live right down the street from Harris Grill, so I would come here often. I like the sangria, but since I only come for happy hour these days, I generally just stick with the $3 cosmopolitans. I've had a few different dishes for dinner and they're OK. I remember going ape over the macaroni and cheese a couple of years ago, but I had a bite of a friend's macaroni and cheese on July 4 and was completely underwhelmed. Maybe my macaroni and cheese tastes have evolved, or maybe the quality has just gone down.   My typical happy hour snacks are hummus with pita and the pierogies. I like the hummus - nothing bad to say. I actually love the hummus. I like texture and there are chunks of whole chickpea. I also like that Harris Grill lets me pick whether I want pita, pita chips, and/or vegetable sticks. The pierogies, to me, are hit or miss. I've had them probably three times and once they were so cooked that they were crunchy and dead, once they were perfect - lightly panfried but still softish, and the other time they were somewhere in between. They always taste like butter though. Seriously. Paula Deen would love these pierogies.   My favorite thing that I've ever had at Harris Grill is the deep dish cookie with the ice cream on top. I dream about that thing, but since I am not actively trying to gain 400 lbs, I stick to eating it once every 6 months or so.   The menu is... cute, if you like cutesy menus. The outdoor seating is great on a warm summer evening.",

This place has a lot of neighborhood dive bar charm complete with tatt'ed hipsters both server and served.  There is one dude with dreadlocks to his knees.  The locals observation of this guy is he is usually in a bad mood and rude.  I didn't interact with him so I cannot comment.  However, I really don't like the idea of someone with hair that has been unwashed for more than 5 years handling my food or walking by food with 4 foot long dreadlocks - which is why we only drank there.   The locals suggest that the reason he appears to be in a bad mood all the time is that he has not washed his hair in the past decade.  :o)  We didn't eat, but the beer selection was awesome.  There were several Belgium beers and our waitress was very good at suggesting some very good beers that I have not had before.",

The staff is both friendly and accommodating and you can tell that the owners are fun people just by reading the menu. They are great decorators and throw some really unique events like Hoggapalooza which is a party for Groundhog's Day. This is not the best restaurant for large groups, but they do have some lounge seating on the top floor. However, it truly is lounge seating, meaning the table is lower than your seat.  Also a recent update: the infamous Sunday brunch buffet is no longer a buffet. While I was a little bummed about missing out on the buffet, the brunch was still wonderful. Brunch costs approximately $18 and consists of unlimited tea or coffee, an alcoholic drink of choice (frozen mimosa, screwdriver, vodka cranberry, and another option I can't remember), fresh fruit, and an entree.",

    "text": "This place was great! Visiting friends in the area we came here twice over the weekend. Each time we were a big group but were seated quickly and given prompt service.   The first time we went it was a Saturday so while we were expecting brunch we found out that only their lunch menu was available (brunch is only on Sunday's). Wasn't a big deal at all since it was noon and their menu was huge and had a lot of great options.  I went with the chicken wings and they were amazing. Actually some of the better wings I've had in a while. I got them with the buffalo sauce however my friend had the chimichurri (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) and he loved them.   We came back on Sunday for the actual brunch and it was also a great experience. The menu is a pre-fix which gets you unlimited coffee, a drink and one of their entrees for just 18 bucks. I went with the eggs Benedict burger. To be honest it wasn't my favorite as the burger meat was pretty over cooked and was a little flavorless. But, others I was with had the breakfast Mac and cheese and that was fantastic. The portion was also massive. I don't think any human being could finish that thing.  Also, they have a great drink menu (which I actually recommend just reading because it was pretty funny) and a decent beer list.  I will for sure go back here next time I'm in the burgh!",

I heard that their fried chicken is super good (but unfortunately they didn't have it that day...) The brunch buffet comes with a drink and I got the frozen mimosa, which wasn't bad.  Service was decent and our waitress was really nice. I would definitely come here if I'm craving brunch again, I think it was around $18 for each person, which is a little steep in my opinion... but for my first time here, I think I had a decently pleasant experience.",

A friend and I hit up Harris Grill at 6:15pm on Wednesday night. It was a very snowy day in Pittsburgh, so we got seated right away and it wasn't busy. We sat downstairs at a table for two. One server brought us two waters and told us that another server would be over shortly to take our order. Our waiter then brought over two additional waters. More water the better, but one of the glasses was dirty - so we sent it back.   Our waiter was nice. He let us know that it was still happy hour, so we ordered some drinks - we both started with the frozen cosmos. Their frozen cosmo is the best. We also ordered the buffalo chicken appetizer - it comes with pita bread and celery sticks. At first, we didn't get celery sticks - so we asked the waiter and he did bring them. You also can order more pita; but it takes a little while for it come.   We had told our waiter that we weren't ready to order our meals when we ordered the appetizer, but  we had to hunt the waiter to finally order our entrees once we were ready. I ordered the original Mac and cheese - because of the snowy day in Pittsburgh- I wanted some some comfort food.   When the Mac and cheese arrived - it looked good, but I was soon disappointed. Their Mac and cheese was more like pasta and cheese. It wasn't flavorful at all. It wasn't cheesy - just very runny. I was very disappointed. I was hungry, so I ate the Mac n cheese - but I definitely order it again.   I think I'll stick to Harris Grill for their happy hours and appetizers - the food is nothing to write home about.",

The whole place was shut down and there was a big lock at the front door. The funny thing is I got like 6  confirmation for this reservation. By email, text message and app notifications. I didn't even bother to call after all these confirmations.  Luckily we found another restaurant near by and had an amazing dinner. But this incident could literally ruin my plan for valentine's day.  My advice: don't rely on online reservation and call to confirm.  Update (after the reply from the owner) Apparently the restaurant recently burned down and I'm sorry to hear that.  However there is no need to be sarcastic about my plans and the way this incident affect me. I wasn't responsible for whatever happened to this restaurant and it's the owner responsibility to inform the customers and prevent any confusion. Clearly the owner had time to post this sarcastic response but not to cancel the reservation functionality.",

I came for a late night snack and although the servers all have amazing personalities and very hospitable, service was a tad slow and food could've been little more flavorful.  Things I liked: - great servers, patiently took our orders, had sense of humor   - Jamaican jerk chicken wings were delicious!  Things I didn't like: - original Mac and cheese, pasta was a bit watery, perhaps slightly over cooked. Flavor was awesome. I really appreciated the use of crunchy bread crumbs to add variations to texture. Could some some kind of salty cheese or other seasoning to bring flavor to the next level. - French fries had great substance. I enjoyed the thick cuts and perfectly fried texture but could be enhanced with seasoning, perhaps salt/pepper.  -this was purely on my poor judgement, but I got too excited with the coming good weather. I ended up sitting outside and freezing my bony bum off!! As a small suggestion, would be awesome if some kind of outdoor heating was introduced (table candles don't count but they create a warm ambience!)",

The building is a couple of stories and the stairs are a bit rustic and the seats worn. That however, did not deter me from a very good dining experience.  The soup of the day was cream of mushroom but I deferred on that when I learned that they make an outstanding crab cake sandwich using real crab cake! It comes with a choice of one side so I chose the grilled vegetables. When I got my food I was thrilled with the portion size and I noticed that the vegetables were crunchy. My waitress explained that they are made purposely that way to include the nutrients.My crab cake sandwich came with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles and it was so good and messy to say the least. But I love them that way! I was thoroughly pleased with my lunch. Even though I was too full to order dessert I noticed on the dessert menu that the use Millie's ice cream from around the corner for toppings or stand alone ice cream.  The Harris Grill and the Shiloh Grill on Mt Washington are run by the same company. I was told that the Shiloh Grill will soon take over the Harris grill name because at the end of this month they are opening a 3rd location downtown on 4 th Ave near Market Square. That location will be three stories high and will be open on weekends. It will take over the spot formerly occupied by Old Tavern 245. Be on the lookout for it when it opens.  I also liked how the place was all decorated with different pigs even one with wings! Cute touch to the place.  Located on Emsworth Ave in Shadyside you can get limited free parking in those permit areas for up to two hours. There is one of these on the street north of it. Otherwise you can bike or feed the meter.",

    "text": "Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch after a date at the Carnegie Museum. The restaurant was crowded.. there was a 10 -15 min wait for a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and rocking out that bar. He was no doubt seasoned. So hungry..ordered food.. the wait was at least 25 min for it to arrive. Maybe they were short staffed in the kitchen? My burger n fries were uneventful (meh) and at that point we would of ate anything. The spicy cole slaw was delicious!   There were plenty of interesting options on the menu from periogies to tacos. It was fun to browse.   I had a feeling the mac and cheese was the hit on the menu.. just wasn't in the mood for it.   The prices vary on the menu .. some menu items are high such as the tacos (pork) for $15.00 and burger with a tiny handful of fries for  $8.00.   Chose Harris grill because figured the prices would be more reasonable than other restaurants in the area... it was and was an \"ok\" lunch.",

The menu is hilarious: dish descriptions connect to pop culture (Stranger Wings) and politics (The Trump Tower Martini). But in addition to its entertaining nature, the menu never fails to provide a delicious option: roasted vegetable salad, lobster Mac and cheese, spinach dip, creative drink options, etc. The outdoor patio is an ideal location in warm, pleasant weather, but the inside also had a great ambiance. Visit Harris Grill for any occasion! It's the best!",

The salad lacked flavor and was overpowered by the blue cheese and the onions. The bacon was too crispy and tasted like store-bought, microwaved bacon. The service was also slow. It took 45 minutes just for a salad! I wouldn't recommend Harris Grill. There are better and tastier options in Shady Side.",

Waitress was very helpful by telling us her favorite dishes along with some other patron favorites. The chips and queso as an appetizer was an excellent choice, the cheese was a perfect temperature and had a wonderful flavor from the peppers mixed in. The Jamaican tacos were bursting with flavor and had a nice kick at the end. To cool the palette down they serve it with a fresh quinoa salad and some grilled vegetables as well. The portions of this food were actually quite large, which left me with some leftovers for a nice lunch the next day. Amazing first time experience, definitely will be coming back!",

We put up with it so we could get the brunch. We stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter. He was flat out rude and upset my friend so we left and won't be coming back. The food isn't that great (the tacos/fajitas are terrible and flavorless, as is the salad), the drinks are grossly overpriced, and the service as I mentioned before is slow and inept.   On the plus side the brunch is great (it just ended because of winter), the food is relatively well-priced and the location is great (if you can find parking). I recommend going elsewhere though because it just isn't worth being treated so poorly by the staff. Management should take note.",

    "text": "We went here tonight for the first time since I was craving a burger and we've been meaning to check this place out. It has a cozy atmosphere: dark, some leather chairs and mis-matchy furniture, candles, a gas fireplace at the door, good music...  We were told there would be a wait, but we were more than welcome to sit at the bar. We were fine with that. Just after we received our drinks at the bar the hostess came over to ask us if we'd mind sitting in the lounge, a table with couches as seating. We gladly took the table in lieu of waiting 20-30 minutes as we originally planned on. We closed our tab at the bar and were seated in the lounge. The couch was comfy and we were happier with the couch than a standard table and chairs, since we were having a date night and we were away from the other patrons, able to sit next to each other :)  We had a pretty entertaining time reading through the food menu, and the drink menu. It's written hilariously.  I decided on the I Can Has Bacon Cheezeburgher (the title! gah!) and my date chose the Thanksgiving Burger (the actual comical name escapes me). My cheeseburger was delicious. Piled with delicious bacon and  cheese, and came with pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce. It was wonderful. I've had many a charred to the point of burnt disgusting burgers in this town and this burger was not one of them. I ordered the fries with it, though I was offered a plethora of options, and the fries were delicious. Crispy, salty, delicious. On the other hand, the thanksgiving burger was MUCH too spicy. In the rosemary spice kind of way. Way too much seasoning. His breath was pretty ungodly the rest of the night, and he didn't particularly enjoy it.  As far as service goes, I specifically want to note that we were well taken care of the whole night. Our waitress as attentive, we never had empty glasses of water or drinks and were not in need of anything. She brought our check when we asked, and it took a few minutes for her to come back to charge our card. Another staff member saw that it hadn't been done yet, came by and took care of it for us without our asking. So either they've been reading the Yelp reviews about service or we were there on a good night.",

She called and asked why and they told her \"oh, our credit card company automatically does that when people don't leave a tip.\" Ummmm...excuse me?? SHE LEFT A $20 TIP IN CASH.

The last time I went in, I had a splendid hummus and pita plate -- and although the pita ran out before the hummus, my request for more pita was immediately handled, with no critique of my rationing capabilities.  If hummus is not your thing, 1) I don't understand you one bit, but 2) try their baby burgers, the arugula steak salad, or the \"labor-inducing vegetarian chili\". They all have my seal of approval.  Lastly, if you like bacon, be sure to try this place out on a Tuesday. That's Bacon Night, and Harris serves it at the bar in baskets of four -- free of charge until they run out for the night. If you're dining at a table it's a buck a basket, but you can still eat to your heart's (dis)content.",

    "text": "Don't understand the hype, as this place serves slightly above-average bar food in a hipsterish, semi-romantic atmosphere. I cannot comment on the bar and/or alcoholic beverages as I did not imbibe on my recent visit, but the menu didn't do much for me.  We arrived on a busy Saturday night, but were seated within 20 minutes. Not bad, but our table was questionable. They took a big, corner booth and split it in half so that 2 parties of four could be accommodated sitting directly across from each other. It was kind of weird obligatorily staring at the couple across from me, but I digress.  Some of my fellow diners started off with the Vegetarian Chili. I sampled some and it was well-spiced and hearty, I didn't miss the meat. We also started off with the Spinach Dip. The dip itself was fine, though I've never really eaten anywhere that could screw up spinach dip.  The entrees then arrived. My companion decided to have their signature Mac and Cheese. The noodles were a perfect al dente, and the cheese itself had a sharp bite. It became difficult to eat after a few bites, however, for the dish was missing a textural contrast. It would've benefited from some breadcrumbs baked on top.  I decided to sample their bacon cheeseburger, which the establishment is apparently pretty proud of. It was cooked to a True medium rare, which is a rare (no pun intended) find in this city. Also, the bacon was heavenly, an ideal combination of lean and fat. They take their bacon seriously here, and it was easily the most interesting part of the burger. The pros of the burger end there however. It was, besides the bacon, pretty boring. The accompaniments (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard) were standard. The patty itself, while well-cooked and of a good quality, was unfortunately underseasoned. The burger could've benefited from something that gave it pizzaz, like a sauce, some spice, or even some more salt!  I opted for onion rings as a side to my burger. They were large, battered, sweet, and a little crispy, though quite greasy.  Maybe it was because it was a busy Saturday night that I was disappointed. I was expecting some high class bar food at this spot. The common theme of the meal was that although the dishes were competently executed, they all lacked something (such as textural contrast) that could've elevated them to True greatness. Definitely not worth the price.",

The mac and cheese was divine. the fact that you could make any combination you wanted was appealing but we went off the menu and I was very happy with it.

This has been by far one of the best dining and bar experiences I've had! Took my girlfriend here for her 31st birthday! She went to The college nearby and said I wouldn't be disappointed! She was absolutely right! The food was superb and even though we had to wait 45 mins for a table it worked out And was Worth it, because we found a place at the bar during the Wait time, which the service was just as Great!!",

    "text": "The first time I went to Harris Grill, I had been living in Pittsburgh for about a week and was on a first date. A year later, my love for Pittsburgh, my date, and Harris is unwavering. I've gone to Harris about twice a month on average since, whether it's because friends or family are in town and I want to go someplace that's both fun and has an approachable menu; because it's 11 p.m. and I need to go someplace where the kitchen's still open yet it isn't overwhelmed with a party crowd; or because I want to enjoy happy hour food paired with an extensive beer list.  I haven't been dazzled by everything on the menu, but I generally think the food is good to very good for the price and atmosphere. The only thing I really haven't liked there was the \"Lasagne Aubergine,\" or eggplant lasagna, which I thought was too salty and generally unappealing the one time I had it.  On the \"okay\" list: chicken quesadilla (also a bit too salty), spinach dip, and tots  Good: pierogies, vegetarian chili, Jamaican jerk wings, and macaroni and cheese  Very good: \"The Clogbuster\" (what I consider to be a real salad, not some pathetic bar \"salad\" with a bunch of fatty things atop two pieces of iceberg lettuce--this one has a bunch of root vegetables, peppers, et cetera)  Love: turkey burger, \"Macaronis et Fromagede Langoustine\" (seafood mac and cheese), and dry-rub bacon wings  The Harris staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive (even during busy times that are typical of nights, weekends, and happy hours). The bar really isn't big enough for the kind of crowd it draws, and it can get pretty packed and noisy, but when the patio's open, it helps relieve some of that crowdedness. Oh, and the parking on and off Ellsworth is a nightmare. Still, I think it's worth a visit for anyone who's looking for a no-fuss night out.",

They have a stellar frozen cosmo but the rest of the drink menu is just okay. Their food menu is a hit or miss. Their turkey burger and mac'n'cheese are great but the rest is probably just okay. Their desserts are unimpressive and it is hard to underwhelm me when it comes to sugar. So I would say, go for the atmosphere and the cosmo but not for much more.",

I personally did not like the waiters as they are a bit pushy with trying to get you to order more drinks/food. Their selection of beer seems pretty cool, but I have never once tried any of their beer and liked it, also they seemed a bit on the warmer side. Also their dips (like the babaganoush) are awful... seems like they have a big bucket of it, then slap some of it on a place, reheat for 30 seconds, and serve.",

I could literally feel generations of customer satisfaction and implored character from the ownership.   I have yet to eat a meal there, aside the experience of maybe 12 pieces of bacon during their seemingly imfamous \"Bacon Night\".   Should you find pairing foods with drinks, try the volatile yet interesting challenge of pairing imports and domestics, maybe even wine or liqour, with a tray of sizzling bacon during Harris Grill's Bacon Nights. Once again, the feeling of personal relationships and character run deep within this establishment, which seems to be the norm in shadyside.  I plan on visiting this establishment more frequently to get to know its staff and regulars.   I'm eagerly awaiting it's spring and summer enviornment so I can give a well rouneded, highly anticipated 5 star review.",

    "text": "When I thought of Harris Grill, I'd think of a bunch of hipsters sprawled out on the patio with clove cigarettes and PBR, talking about their new garage band or their sister's new girlfriend.   I suppose that is largely still True, though it's not nearly as off-putting in real life as it is in my annoyed imagination.  Harris Grill lives on Ellsworth Avenue, a notoriously \"trendy\" section of Shadyside.  Usually when I employ that word, trendy, I mean it in a bad way...trendy haircut...trendy leg-warmers...trendy Vampire Weekend album.  At any given moment, you could probably find all three of those things at Harris Grill, but the restaurant itself is not \"trendy.\"  Its style is refreshingly original, sultry even.  From the smart-assed menu to the creepy paintings of clergy-folk on the restroom doors, Harris Grill has injected so much weirdness into the atmosphere, it's impossible for me to not love it.  And love it, I do.  I've had many great times at the Harris, and when it was out of commission for while after a Pompeii-style fire evacuation, I missed it dearly (ok, maybe that's an exaggeration).  It's been my birthday celebration host for a few years now (Harris Grill is the new McDonald's ballpit) and at the recommendation of the aforementioned menu, I've been known to take advantage of their weekend brunch Prix Fixe menu to shake off a hangover or a bad date.  One of my all-time favorite memories of this city is the day my buddy Sam & I sat on the patio and drank 37 whiskey & lemonades.  (Man, I love drinking outside with friends.  Harris Grill is PERFECT for that; if only Pittsburgh had more than fifteen minutes of sunlight a year).  Anyway, I thought I had the place figured out...Harris Grill is a good time for a crazy little lush like me.  It wasn't until I went there for dinner, with a real official date, that I realized just how perfectly the food and service complement the fun atmosphere and drink menu.  Ryan and I walked over to the Harris Grill for dinner on an especially creepy & crispy fall night.  Of course the patio was packed, so we took a table for two upstairs.  It is surprisingly sexy on that second floor; the walls are dark, but there neat light fixtures all over the place...you can see your food and your date, but you aren't distracted by the knuckleheads surrounding you; it's intimate and nice without being cheesy.  Luckily that is not the case with the Buffalo Chicken dip appetizer, which was very cheesy and also sexy.  Served with warm pita and topped with crumbled bleu cheese, this concoction would make any chicken proud.  For dinner, I enjoyed a fresh (fresh! fresh!) Greek Salad, complete with grilled chicken, pitted Kalamata olives and feta cheese (hmm...didn't realize how much I love cheese...).  Ryan practically ranted about how good his Henny Penny was...blackened chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and spicy mayo on texas toast.  Oh, and I had a really killer draft beer, too;  Anderson Valley Winter Solstice.  Jamie, our waitress, was friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  She told us before we looked at the menu what the restaurant was out of that night, but then she also made recommendations for other awesome dishes.  (Thanks, Jamie!)  The whole thing came in at just under $50.00, and that's including the bar drinks- pretty good.  The only complaint I have about the place is that it's always crowded.  Then again, even the out-of-the-way tables are not excluded from the interesting atmosphere & great service.   (Oh!  The second floor of the Harris has large booths facing huge floor to ceiling windows...if you ever want to take a handful of hungry people to dinner, it's perfect for people-watching.)  Obviously, I really dig this place.  I'll probably write about it more than once, just so you can get an idea of whether it is consistently awesome (or not).  I find that it's got different vibes at different times of year (mainly due to space because the patio is closed on snowy winter days).  In the meantime, I'd encourage you to check it out for yourselves...just don't park in the lot next to the restaurant; watching tow trucks haul cars out of there is more fun than a Pirates game.  And I almost forgot:  Tuesday is Bacon Night!

The atmosphere can't be beat, the outdoor patio is one of the cities best, the drinks are consistent, and the menu is just good fun. The brunch at Harris is really something special, and a frozen mimosa is probably the second coolest thing ever. The first, naturally, is the frozen cosmo, which the Harris Grill has perfected (I get mine with a shot of Chambord...mmmm). They have lots of vegetarian options for me, although they've done away with the falafel wrap recently...what gives? It was a favorite! They make some badass Mac & Cheese, and the portion is huge. Their desserts are worth saving room for. The second floor is my favorite place to sit, feels intimate and kind of dark and cozy. And I especially like the big booths right in front of the giant window overlooking Walnut Street, so you can do some people watching while you dig in.",

It gets busy here with their lower costs items and drink specials pulling out the college crowd. So be prepared to deal with that some nights. What turns me off a bit, it always seems dirty. I wish it had more of a cleanly feel so I could get into eating here more. The bathroom smells, the menus seem filthy, but I like the food!  Pretty much, it puts me in a tough place because if the rooms are dirty, what does the kitchen look like. I still come back when friends want to go, but I'm never running back.  Clean it up Harris Grill and I'll be back!",

    "text": "I started coming here for work lunch meetings years ago, back before I was even 21. I was told it's the best menu in town, regardless of what food is on it. Years later, I still agree that it's hilarious bringing newcomers here just to read the menu.  The drink menu is massive and overwhelming, and when you ask for a recommendation they will usually tell you to go with a seasonal item (cocktails or beers) or a manhattan (they also have a full page menu of manhattans.) They currently have a pumpkin sangria that is to die for. The patio is always packed, even when it's cold out, because it's pretty fab.  The drinks aren't cheap, which is a bummer. Luckily the cocktails really are pretty special, though. Happy hour is good for beers, but that's about all. If you're looking for cocktails to please the manliest of men to the girliest of girls, go to Harris Grill. He can get a manhattan and she can get a dessert chocolate and baileys concoction, or something.  I've been here for all kinds of reasons, but I think it's best for snacks and drinks. The food menu has some Pittsburgh specialties that I would recommend for fun and for out-of-towners, but I've also had many \"tots n beers\" nights that have hit the spot perfectly. (The vego chili is also perfect to pair with a meal or as a snack).  Sometimes the drinks are better than others. I have ordered the same manhattan and the same bloody mary on different nights, and they were worlds apart. That is disappointing, but Harris Grill has always got something to make up for any pitfalls.",

(4) every good thing associated with tater tots, do i need to say more?  but seriously i have tried other things there, n they are just as fabulous, the calamari is definitely a must-try.. their bacon n cheese burger is glorious, even the vegan falafel tasted like i was eating meat (meaning that it was just as flavorful as everything else)  the ambiance is what you want it to b, i've come here with my girlfriends, i've also come here with a posse of dudes and not to mention on suit night with my best guy friend.. its always a good time.  i love dining here esp when its warm out so my friends n i can chill on the deck n drink to the moon and stars",

First, their happy hour from 5-7 Monday-Friday where all drafts are half off, a few specialty cocktails are 5 bucks, and several appetizers are half off.  Second, they have a fairly high-quality, medium sized selection of craft beers.  Third, they have an awesome outdoor patio seating area for nice days.  Fourth, for the area, they have above average food at a reasonable price.  A few of the negatives are the limited bar seating which often fills up at busy times, service which can be variable in quality, lack of drink specials outside of happy hour, and the somewhat cramped tables inside.  Overall, this is one of the better places to try in the area, especially at happy hour or when looking for outdoor seating.",

I love their creative menu and have tried almost everything on the menu over the last 8 years since my first visit.  Some of my favorite items are:  The Polish Church Basement Pierogies - my maternal grandmother used to make homemade perogies every year for Christmas and Easter, and these perogies are just as delicious as hers were - I definitely recommend them if you like perogies!  The fish tacos are always great as well, and the mac and cheese is rich and creamy, especially the Macaronis et fromage de langoustine - if you are a fan of \"fancy\" mac and cheese with crab/lobster in it then you will not be disappointed!  It's a great dish to share!  I've tried most of their salads and my favorites are the Hail, Caesar! and the Great Salmon I Am.    There are lots of choices on the menu for every kind of person - kids, carnivores, vegans and vegetarians, it's a diverse menu which makes it easy to dine there with a large group of friends or family because of the variety.  They also have a full bar and a great selection of beers and wine available.  The atmosphere is casual and laid back and I've been there for work events on a few occasions and we've always been pleased.  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I used to love this restaurant, which is why I wanted to come here for my birthday earlier this week. I live in Chicago but was in town visiting family in Pittsburgh. Since we had plans in the evening, we came for lunch. The place was empty, and since two people in my party have trouble walking up and down stairs, we asked to be seated on the first floor. For the entirety of the meal, we had to share the small, first-floor room with a group of employees having a rather loud staff meeting. I get that the restaurant is relatively empty on a weekday afternoon, but it affected our enjoyment of the meal. Well, mostly the food affected our enjoyment, but I'll get to that.  Harris Grill's bacon cheeseburger is one of my favorite burgers I've ever had, but on my visit, it was pretty lackluster. Someone else in my party got mac n cheese, and the amazing mac n cheese I remember is now bland. The tater tots on the side with my burger arrived overcooked and so crunchy they hurt to eat. You could tap a knife against them and couldn't cut them, that's how hard they were. I mentioned this to the server, and she was apologetic and put in a new order of tater tots that took 15-20 minutes to arrive at the table. By the time I got the new order of tater tots, I was almost done with my burger. I'd understand if the restaurant were super busy, but it wasn't. (Aside from a table outside, the only other customers were my party, as far as I could tell.) Usually, if there's something wrong with a side and it takes that long to come out, the side will be comped or you'll at least get an apology for the wait. I got neither.  Service was very slow. Getting drink refills took a long time, as did our food. Again, I'd understand if they were busy, but we sat there for a long time.  Harris Grill used to be so good and one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, but I don't think I'll be coming back.",

We were riding around, trying to find a place that didn't have a 4 day wait and would satisfy a monstrous appetite. And of all the brunch places in all the world, this one came walking into my life.  Here's the deal that can't be beat: an unlimited Breakfast buffet with smoked salmon, eggs Benedict, an omelet station, and a frozen mimosa for $15. That's right kids! Add to that the great selection of beers and cocktails and you may need to move in. I was so satiated that I didn't eat another meal the rest of the day.  The bonus was that there was great outdoor seating so we could participate in some obligatory people-watching.  Next time I am back in this great town, I will definitely be hitting this place up again. I just need to see where I can purchase one of those additional stomachs and an extra-stretchy pair of pajama jeans.",

    "text": "4 stars for their happy hours and service, 2.5 stars for food/drinks/value outside of happy hour  Despite my slightly-less-than-enthusiastic rating, I am going to preface this review by saying that Harris Grill holds a very special place in my heart.  It's definitely not a place to take your \"foodie\" or wine/cocktail enthusiast type friends, and it would be hard to convince me to come here outside of the happy-hour hours, but it is a staple of the pittsburgh grad student experience.  Happy hours at Harris Grill are very happy hours, indeed.  Everything on the \"fun things\" appetizer list is $5, the wings--which are one of the tastier items on the menu--are half price, and frozen cosmopolitans and craft beers are all half price!  Frozen cosmos are a Harris Grill specialty...and, if you're into that kind of drink, you will find them delicious.  They are frosty cold, strong, and not too sweet, with a very pretty presentation.  The craft beer tap list is always rotating and often includes an excellent selection (plus, you can't beat the $2.50-$3.50 prices).  The outdoor spaces are lovely -- the front patio (a prime location right on Ellsworth) is the best, and the smaller back patio is cute as well.  Because they're so awesome in warm weather, you have to arrive earlier than 4:30 on weekdays to claim a table for your party if you're coming for happy hour.  Outside of happy hours, though, the food is very mediocre for the prices you're paying, and the craft beers are normally priced at $4.50-$7.00 (and suddenly the selection seems so much less impressive compared to the big beer bars like Fat Heads and D's Six Pax).  The other drinks are fine enough, but nothing to write home about.  They do brunch as well, but I was less than impressed with the food and my bloody mary.  The service can sometimes be slow during very busy days/hours, but it's almost always very friendly and goofy.  Harris Grill servers are some of the most fun and accommodating of any place you'll find in Pittsburgh.  They've done all kinds of weird things for my friends and me in the past, including accept their tip via personal check and move an entire couch for me because I dropped my purse behind it and could not reach it.  Despite the unimpressive quality of the food and drink value outside of happy hour, Harris Grill definitely has personality.  This is not only evidence in their service but also in their menu!  The menu has a cover that rotates through photographs of the staff making crazy faces and being silly, and it features dish names such as The Britney Spears (chicken tenders on a skewer) and Traditional Italian Divorce Soup.  All of these things ultimately combine for an almost guaranteed fun time with friends.  I just prefer to do it during happy hour!",

    "text": "Might I say that this is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to get a late night bite and brew?  Yes, I might and will say this.  After a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, I decided I needed to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort food and try out a few brews.  This, my friends, is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).  My friend had beat me there and already had one of each in front of her.  She decided on the Trailerpark Tatchos and I'm not quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting in an interesting glass.  The Tatchos were amazing.  Nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant idea none the less.  The mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great.  In a single bite you got spicy, hot and cool.  I decided that I needed to order something else myself, as I feared that my friend might end up raising her lip and snarling at me for eating more than I should.  I got myself an order of Cloudy and a Chance of These.  I dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.   DING DING DING...you, sir get a prize...not really.  Nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  Served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed.  The right combination of spices mixed with the melted cheese on top was what did it for me.  And that bread made sure I didn't miss a smear of that sauce.  As for the brews, I tasted three different ones while I was here.  It was kind of hard to choose, but their nifty little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  What also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able to make suggestions, not just guesses like most places.    Different flavors hitting my palate at just the right time made for a great night here.  I will definitely keep this on my short list when I need to calm myself after a hectic day at work.",

    "text": "Went to Harris Grill last night for my last night in Pittsburgh.  Really cool experience and it was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.  First, Tuesday is bacon night and I'm not quite sure how it works, but I heard it's free bacon at the bar and $1 baskets of bacon if you're sitting at a table.  My friends and I had a drink and some bacon at the bar while we waited for a table (obviously bacon night is a hit and makes the restaurant busy).  I really enjoyed the selection of beers.  I wanted to try the Game of Thrones beer, but liked the amber beer they had too much to switch.  As an app, we shared the buffalo chicken dip.  It was not the biggest portion, but it's always nice eating grilled pita instead of just tortilla chips every so often.  The dip had very large pieces of chicken and was crusted with blue cheese.  Pretty basic and well executed.  The menu is pretty simple, but difficult to read.  My friends had been there before so they knew what to look for, but I had a difficult time reading through the commentary and trying to tell what was in each dish.  One of my friends recommended something he had gotten before, so I decided that was easier than wasting my time with the menu.  I got the mac and cheese and added in lobster and bacon.  It was really decadent and better than I expected.  The cheese was very creamy and flow-y.  A lot of times, the cheese on mac and cheese doesn't flow well, but I really liked the consistency of Harris Grill's mac and cheese.  The lobster was also very delicious.  As for the bacon, they just put it on top.  So basically it was lobster mac and cheese with some bacon strips on top.  I was expecting either bacon bits mixed with everything or even bacon strips submerged in the cheese.  Nonetheless, the bacon was very crispy and i dipped a few strips in the cheese which was a solid idea.",

They even have the same parking issues, when the Harris Grill is hopping, you'll park blocks away.   The Spring/Summer menu is on the docket now, some great items new are build your own bowl, I picked Quinoa, Grilled vegetables, and grilled salmon. The grilled vegetables were expertly cooked, crisp tender, smokey sweetness and the salmon was just under done, perfect! The quinoa was tender and an excellent foil for the smoked vegetables. Also on the menu is a greens free salad called Alexander The Great. It's Quinoa, chopped red peppers, Feta cheese, cucumbers, cured olives and a lemon vinaigrette. Light, yet filling from the protein packed Quinoa, it's a great dish for those HOT summer nights and sitting on the deck, great with a cold IPA or a Malbec.   Both restaurants offer great servers, bartenders and friendly hosts. If you're a snooty Yelper and expect white collar waitstaff, these bars aren't going to be for you. If you are looking for a fun place to eat and imbibe, meet honest to goodness down to earth people, then the Harris and Shiloh grills are for you. Open for lunch now at 11:31 am. I removed a star because I had to circle the bar three times before I could park my car.",

    "text": "I've been to Harris several times before but always seem to forget to Yelp afterwards. However, my last visit left an impression and I couldn't forget to share thoughts with all of you!   We started with an appetizer of hummus, pita bread and vegetables. I was actually introduced to hummus at Harris about a year ago and judge other hummus selections in comparison to Harris'. It's sooooo good. It's thick, a tad bit spicy and perfect to munch on before and during your meal.   During my last visit I ordered the Henny Penny and I was definitely satisfied. From the description, I knew it would have a \"zing,\" but I didn't expect to be a fire breathing dragon (it's all good, though! I like spicy stuff!). They used a certain breading that almost reminded me of a wing-dust seasoning to bread the chicken in and topped it off with vegetables and a delicious homemade mayo that added to the zesty-ness of it all. Of course what sandwich isn't perfected without fries! Yum!  My only complaint is the crowd. Maybe because it was a Friday night? Maybe because it was during the Pride Pub Crawl? I don't know... I just don't do well with screaming and obnoxious people as I'm trying to eat my sandwich and have a conversation with my friend. We were even upstairs and away from the bar. It's all whatever, though. Between the food and the good service, Harris always has me happy.",

I think they were focusing more on alcohol sales and less on quality food but hopefully that tide has turned.   I loved the baby burgers when they were around and now they have a similar slider appetizer but it's the same. Their ranch dressing is great, and take it from me, I KNOW GOOD RANCH. Also sitting on the front porch is nice in the summer; I love the second floor window seat too.   Dislikes include the long waits, sometimes slow service, hit or miss food, and often loud atmosphere.",

    "text": "Easily my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been frequenting Harris since the summer I turned 21 as a wee college senior, and this place grew for me to become a staple for my grad school classmates and I for post-exam celebrations, birthday bashes, and general shenanigans. The menagerie of frozen cocktails that Harris slings up throughout the year centers around the crown jewel that is the frozen cosmo, of which I will gladly avail for half-price during happy hour in July and January alike. Also, Tuesday night is bacon night. Need I say more?  Drinks (and free bacon) aside, though, I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at Harris. Highlights over the years have included their turkey burger (look for its Yinzer moniker, \"Thanksgiving in Blawnox,\" on their wholly entertaining food menu), the wings (half-price during HH--get the dry bacon rubbed wings with a side of the Columbian Gum Nummers sauce), the mac 'n cheese (I got some sort of breakfast-style once with peppers, bacon, and fried egg--the M&C is big enough and fun to share, but no judgment from me if yinz want it all to yourself).   IRL: I took my family here on my grad school graduation day, and despite skepticism (looking at you, mom), everyone loved their meal, from said skeptic mama to my 86-year-old grandfather. The service is excellent and the ambiance welcoming. Harris, you'll be my Shadyside standby for what I hope to be years to come.",

    "text": "My friend suggested meeting up here for Friday happy hour. Though I trust her recommendations, I really wasn't anticipating that much. The name -- Harris Grill -- seemed a little ho-hum, and I was expecting your typical Pittsburgh-type place with basic appetizers and lots of Yuengling.  However, as soon as I sat down, I knew this place was going to be different. First of all, it was packed! The cute little patio had lots of young professionals ranging in attire from girls in maxi dresses to guys wearing dress pants, button-ups, and ties. Thankfully, one of my friends had arrived a few minutes before 5pm and secured the last available table on the patio. Lots of local residents were taking advantage of the absolutely incredible weather to sit outside.  After quickly becoming intimidated by the enormous drink \"book,\" I just took my friend's recommendation and ordered a frozen cosmo. Wow! Delicious!! It was the perfect blend of cold but not too icy and not too sweet but not too sour. I could drink these things every day! Well, maybe not every day... because they pack a serious punch! I was warned not to order the additional shot when it was offered to me, and thankfully I heeded the warning. After two of these beverages, I was definitely tipsy! In my opinion, two of these little frozen cosmos pack the same amount of buzz as 3-4 glasses of wine.  In addition to amazing frozen cosmos, I enjoyed trying their appetizers. The spinach dip and pita was tasty, and the pierogies, though very different from the pierogies that I have had in the past, were out-of-this-world good. I was tempted to order a second round of the pierogies but didn't want to appear gluttonous.   Service was pretty good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was and how tightly we were packed onto the little patio. Our waiter both resembled and acted like Conan O'Brien, which was just the icing on the cake of a great happy hour experience.  And, finally, the check arrived. My jaw nearly fell on the floor. Three of us girls drank 7 frozen cosmos and ate 3 appetizers... for $40. How is that even possible? If I had known in advance that the frozen cosmos were $3/each, I might have just chugged them and taken a cab home.  Needless to say, I'll be back!",

They're well known for their mac and cheese, so this time around I chose to try the jerk chicken macaroni. Our waiter quickly told me that he thought it was the best thing on the menu.

I had originally mainly visited during the happy hour, but to be honest the happy hour is just alright. $5 cocktails and apps, or something else not super memorable. The drinks are good and the appetizers are nice, but small. They usually have some type of frozen drink option, such as a frozen cosmo or mojito. I've had the hummus multiple times and it comes with a nice spread of vegetables and is a pretty good size.   I had gone for brunch a few months ago and was actually really happy about the food and service. I went for the brunch buffet and was actually really impressed. They didn't have a ton of vegetarian options, but they did have a create your own omelet station in which my omelet was cooked in front of me. They also had the best breakfast potatoes ever. And a good assortment of fruit and mini bagels with lox.  The servers are pretty good and most places you can be seated are nice, besides the weird window seat which seems nice at first, but is a hard place to converse due to the only seats facing one direction (instead of facing each other.)",

When the host sat us, he gave us a great overview of the menu, specials, his favorite dishes and drinks.   And the food! I ordered the steak salad (boring, but after 3 weeks of eating out while moving, I wanted VEGGIES) with the Lemon Garlic Vinaigrette. The salad = love; the dressing wasn't my favorite but fortunately, the salad didn't really need it. My husband ordered the Crabby Road (crab cake burger) and I had a bite and it also was delish.

A three-story, re-imagined Victorian house, this place really provides the atmosphere and creativity that the people of Shadyside require. However, I would like to emphasize the distinction between appeal and delivery in regards to what we're there for (the food)! The regular menu is diverse and entertaining - I actually ENJOY the sarcastic descriptions. The wings are great and the custom bowls look heavenly. With that being said, the brunch menu is a bit frustrating. A standard price of $20.17 per meal is ambitious for what you get, especially if you can't drink. Without the mimosa, you get a coffee, dry biscuits, and breaded chicken under thick gravy with potatoes (Chicken Littles). Regardless, very solid and will definitely return after 5 pm.",

The Harris is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh and they have fantastic bartenders...Byron, Caleb...mix excellent cocktails w friendly smiles.  BUT.  They keep changing the menu and I know many restaurants do this but its starting to get tiring.  If you dine here, please ask what they are out of first and have a back up menu selection made just in case.  If you do eat here, I recommend:  The Chicken Riggies The hamburger the mac n cheese The wings the pierogies The Henny Penny The Garden Weasel  I suggest you avoid:  The greek salad.  For some reason I ALWAYS get a hair in this salad.  And no, they are not strings from onions, they are dark hairs!  Eww.    The tarragon dressing:  It's basically liquid salt and will render anything you are eating inedible.  More effective than Sensa.  Trust me.  The Delmonico A  go go:  sounds like the sandwich is going to be good, but its very gristly and not that great  I really, really, really wish they'd bring the falafel sandwich back but it seems it's gone to Harris Menu Item heaven.  Also, they have good brunches here on Sunday's but it is buffet style when the weather is nice.  I like their brunch, but I prefer it when they have a menu in the colder months.  With the buffet you can't, for example, just get fried eggs or anything like that.  But it still pretty good.  I like this place, but maybe I've just dined here too often?  I don't know.  I just havent had my mind blown here in awhile.",

    "text": "Goat in a Boat = very good Mac and Cheese = pretty decent, definitely better than the diner stuff Creme Brulee = AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE Nice selection of beer  The menu is pretty obnoxious, but the prices are reasonable.  Had deck seating so can't really comment on the inner-decor, however the deck was nice and large, service was prompt, and only a few loud cars driving by.  The parking for this place is horrible.  DO NOT park in the adjacent lot or you will be towed; street parking only.    Food: There are quite a few veggie-friendly options.  We ordered the Goat in a Boat appetizer.  Pretty tasty--a concoction of feta and roasted red peppers. It came with warm pita bread to dip and if I were to come back here, I wouldn't hesitate in ordering it again.  As for the main course, my friend ordered the falafel which he seemed to like, and I ordered the mac and cheese.  This mac and cheese is supposedly very large and famous.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with either of those labels.  It is a normal bowl size full, and the sauce has a slight kick, but I wouldn't claim it to be anything too too special.  However, it was good, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce wasn't too runny;  I would probably order it again.  $11 something for a bowl is kind of hefty though.   Dessert:  This is where it all went wrong.  I am a huge fan of creme brulee and this is probably the worst I've eaten.  It comes in a boat-like dish with a very shallow amount of custard.  The sugar was torched poorly, the custard wasn't cold...cause there wasn't enough of it to not be affected by the torch... and ugh... a total disappointment.  Not only was it prepared improperly, it just didn't taste good.   I have no idea how it is a \"Harris Grill Favorite.\"  I did hear from someone else that their oreo something? is excellent.   Side note:  Bacon Tuesday is pretty bomb, but don't expect crispy bacon.  Overall, this place was good.  I wouldn't say it's wonderful, like I've heard from many others, but I wouldn't not recommend it either.",

    "text": "Beer selection is pretty decent. They have lots of \"Sex in the City\"-wannabe martinis to go w/ the \"Sex in the City\"-wannabe crowd. But don't expect to run into some skinny b!tch in Manolos. It's more in that \"That's SOOO my life\" delusion way so common these days.   Food is okay, but I find it's kind of hit or miss depending on what you're ordering and what night it is. Nothing stellar. One does not go here for the food rather the patio and the free bacon on Tuesdays. Service is also possibly very good or very bad.   I actually don't even remotely hate this place. It's a fun place to be.",

    "text": "I've been to Harris Grill many times. My favorite thing is their happy hour -- half off all drafts, frozen cosmos, and wings from 4:30-6:30 PM. I'm happiest if I just stop by for a couple of brews and wings. The strawberry chipolte wings are great -- I just love the flavor of the sauce. It's not too spicy but very good.  Aside from happy hour, I've had very mixed experiences with the food there.  Sometimes it's been good, other times it's been overcooked and/or bland. I've also had some fairly slow service there but nothing bad enough to stop me from going back.  It's definitely a place worth checking out (you guys be sure to take a stop in the bathroom while you're there... I hear they have a very interesting urinal), but I tend to stick to bar food/brews when I go.",

I came here for the first time on a first date with my now-husband, but that really hasn't influenced my positive review of the place. Everything I mentioned above has taken care of that. My favorites are the fish tacos (though I preferred them more when they let you choose your side--tater tots!--and were cheaper), the \"goat in a boat,\" and the frozen cosmos ($3 during happy hour). Yes, it can be busy, but most good places are!",

I can't even count the amount of times I've gone here with a group of girls and the waitresses have had to manage trays and trays of frozen cosmo's (which, like many have mention, at about $3 for happy hour = awesome). They have a vast and eclectic cocktail menu; another of my favorites from which is their caramel appletini with a floating apple slice in it.  I'm also a big fan of their food; most notable the buffalo chicken dip which has a really strong, zesty flavor and their Thanksgiving burger (ground turkey w/ cranberry, a little bit of gravy sauce, and mash potatoes on the side). Also, who can forget free bacon Tuesdays? This place has it all.",

I'm no expert, but I hadn't heard of 3/4 of them and the waiter recommended a tasty blueberry one. - Decent, spicy mussels.  Not the best I've ever had, but be honest with yourself, you're not going to find awesome seafood in Pittsburgh.  Wasn't rubbery at all and the sauce was nice. - Tasty, perfectly-sized, bite sized cheeseburger appetizers. - Wings that weren't too greasy yet very flavorful. - We were there for bacon night.  Who would have thought eating strips of plain ol' bacon would be good?  It is! - Nice patio.  Not too packed so you can talk, yet busy enough that you feel like you're part of the action. - Friendly, attentive, helpful waiter.  WEIRD: - Took forever to get drinks and food. - My coworker said the wings weren't legit jerk chicken like advertised. - The patio was a little too... romantic.  Meaning it was so dark I couldn't read the menu except by holding it up to the little candle at our table.  Ditto when we went inside for a bit.  Maybe that'd be awesome if I was on a sexy date instead of with two coworker dudes.  I wasn't.  :(  All in all, I'd come back if I was looking for a date place to have a light dinner or a place to chill with some close friends.",

    "text": "Zero stars for service.  Zero stars for price. One star for food.  I have been to the Harris Grill three separate times for dining.  The first was happy hour - with a party of six. We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated, service was extremely slow.  Our server was slow to arrive at our table to begin and take our drink order. Our drinks took even longer to arrive (approx. 20 min from when seated.)  The appetizers were tasty, although overpriced. Buffalo chicken dip was very good. Service remained poor.  Perhaps they were just very busy and understaffed.   The second time I came was midweek, midday, for lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  Surely we would get good, prompt service now?  Not so much.  All I ordered was the chocolate cupcake dessert.   It took about 25 minutes.  It looked like half a cupcake was dropped on the floor, and then attempts made at making the broken pieces look presentable on a plate.  Half of it was luke-warm, half of it was cold.  Terrible.  WTF?  The most recent and I promise the last time I will ever go to the Harris Grill was a Sunday for brunch.  Again a 30min wait for a party of 3 to be seated.  I understand that - its Sunday - its Brunch - lots of places have a wait.  But again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty.  Finally seated it again took 20 minutes to get our drinks - orange juice. And then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages.  The third took another 10 minutes.  Seriously??  Our food took an hour. SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!  Several items on the menu were out.  (We arrived at noon for a brunch that was supposed to last from 10-2pm).  The menu was prix fixed at $14.  $14 for two pieces of French toast with disgusted, dried out frozen tater tots. (They had run out of home fries). The eggs Benedict were dried and hardened - just plain gross.  The eggs over easy had no runny yolk. The sausage was very good.  They served us the wrong toast.  You couldn't get worse food or service at a McDonalds run by newborn donkeys.",
