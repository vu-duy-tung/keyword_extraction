    "text": "We were visiting Pittsburgh and sort of stumbled on Daphne Cafe while looking for a nice casual dinner. It's a small place, family-run and friendly, with a rewarding and interesting menu.  I've eaten at many Turkish restaurants through the years, in different US cities, and while they vary from place to place they tend to have a pretty standard menu - meaning what you might eat in Istanbul. But Daphne Cafe has a more unusual, though equally delicious menu--featuring food in the style of the city of Ismir.  It was a pleasure to try several new things, and everything we had was honestly terrific - good portions, but also very flavorful and freshly prepared. The owner was really friendly, and came by to chat after we had finished dinner (and pointed out a special dessert to try as well).  The service is a bit slow and sometimes distracted (meaning you have to get the attention of someone, who may be back stocking shelves, as it's a place where everyone does everything). But well worth a visit.",

    "text": "This is my go-to for takeout in Shadyside. The walk-in service is quite good; prompt, cordial, and they even let you sit at a table while you wait. I definitely prefer getting something to go here than eating in, because the staffing here is minimal and usually just has one young lady working both the indoor and outdoor seating. If you eat in, it won't necessarily be very efficient. (The staff has always been quite nice, just not quick.)  For food, any of the gyro dishes are delicious - particularly the gyro salad, which is simple but very filling and has a tasty, garlicky dressing that isn't too heavy. The hummus with pita is good too, but I'd most recommend a side of their French fries, which are crisp yet meaty and have a jealousy-inducing aroma. Luckily, you get a ton of them for your couple bucks, so it's not a big loss to share with a friend.  I'd recommend this place any day of the week...except Monday, seeing as they're closed.",

    "text": "Daphne's has very tasty, healthy Turkish food and an especially cute patio.  I like dropping by in the summertime to sit in the sunshine and grab lunch on the weekend.  It's an under-appreciated spot in Shadyside-- I have never seen it crowded.  The interior is very casual and less welcoming than the outside. A few more decorations and music/ambiance would make it feel more like a sit-down place and les like a take-out spot.   One bone to pick--they charge (or used to charge) an absurd amount (maybe $6 extra?) to add a protein like chicken to their salads.  This seems really silly to me and disproportionately pricey; I hope they have changed that.  They have an excellent Greek salad and I'd be a much happier camper if I could get a little chicken on it and not pay $15 dollars, when everything else on the menu is in the $8-10 range.",

And don't even get me started on their pita- it was fresh, warm, and delicious! For my entree, I ordered the chicken kabob, which was really great (especially because this can be a pretty basic dish)- but the chicken was marinated deliciously and the rice was great!  Decent portions, too.  My partner had the Doner (gyro) panini, which looked amazing (and he said it was pretty awesome!)  It was a huge sandwhich- he is a guy who can typically eat a LOT- and he was full upon finishing the panini!  We will definitely be returning; may become a regular for us!  The atmosphere was a little on the plain side; but you can tell when you enter that it is truly authentic food, so we didn't mind the simple atmosphere at all!",

Lamb is one of my favorites and they know what they're doing with it here.  We came in on a Friday night? Maybe? And it was still early so not crowded at all. There were three women working and we didn't feel ignored or under-served once. So perhaps they've finally worked out the kinks in service?  Either way, this place is really affordable and tasty. I'll definitely be back for a gyro!",

In terms of appetizers, I'd recommend getting the appetizer sampler because it gives you a small taste of everything on the menu. The pita they give with the sampler is warm and you can always ask for more which is a plus.  In terms of main dish they have a variety of kebabs (which is more authentically Turkish than some of the paninis)  which are delicious. If you're a fan of spicier meat I'd recommend the Adana kebab but their other kebabs are equally tasty.  I wouldn't recommend getting dessert, it isn't homemade, the baklava they served us wasn't very moist.",

Me and my wife used to eat their kebabs salads and their mixed appetizer plate then when we tried their fish that is shipping from mediterranian sea is just so delicious. Its sad that they dont have it all the time but I would recommend you to ask if they have fish.   Their prices are also great you will be paying double when you go to brandy restaurands and you wont even get the same freshness and taste.",

The hummus and ezme were decent but nothing to write home about, and the eggplant with sauce was delicious.  The hummus appetizer also came with a very stingy portion of pita, barely enough to even eat half of the hummus.  Additional pita costs extra $$.  Probably the most off-putting aspect of the experience was the service.  We started with an appetizer of hummus but then decided to split the mixed appetizer platter as our meal.  Our interactions with our server misled us to believe that we could count the hummus as part of our mixed appetizer platter, so we only listed two other dips that we wanted.  Then, when the order came out, we had a platter of those two dips and *another* order of hummus.  Had we known that we had to choose three separate new dips for the platter, we would certainly have ordered something new as our 3rd choice.  We felt very misled by the server and she did not apologize when we seemed confused, though she did explain that the portion sizes for each of the dips in the appetizer platter were smaller than they are when ordering an isolated appetizer.  I think I'll give this place another shot to try some of their other food since there are many other rave reviews of the wraps/gyros/etc, and I bet the outdoors seating will be super cute when the weather is warmer.",

Their customer service was so bad, we didn't even stay to finish the food. We got boxes, packed up the food, paid the bill and immediately left in protest.   Firstly my friends were embarrassed by the manager who rudely interrupted them in the middle of their prayer (they are muslim). After ordering food, my friends had specially moved out side on to the dark and wet patio for the prayer(it was after sundown, it had just rained and no one was there) to make sure that the guests inside would not be disturbed, I saw the manager take a look at them and then walk into the kitchen. A few seconds later he and another female employee interrupted my friends in the middle of the prayer and forced them to go inside saying:   \" You cannot pray out side, this is not your country, this is America\".   The people on the table next to us started staring and we sat there in silence after getting publicly embarrassed, thinking how it would be completely pointless to rationally argue with this person who obviously had no concept of freedom of religion, expression or speech.  If that wasn't enough already, the waitress was super rude to us as well.  The waitress clumsily dropped the top bread of my kofte' burger on the table in front of everyone, put the rest of the burger in front of me, didn't even stop to apologize in courtesy or pick up the bread and just walked away. I was completely stunned at this non-professional attitude and downright rudeness. I called the waitress back and she casually asked: \"what do you want?\" and I asked for a replacement on the burger, to that she said:\"I will bring you another top part of the bread\" and then walked away.   We immediately asked for boxes when she came back with the top bread. They gave us boxes after making us wait for another ten minutes, we paid the bill and we quickly left.",

But the wrap was a white tortilla from Sysco (the tortillas were in the display case behind the counter, that's how I know! Tacky!) which I thought was gross and weird. I mean even Sysco sells pita, which would have been a slight improvement. My next pet peeve about this falafel is that there were no cucumbers on it. My next pet peeve is that there were pale-totally-unripe-flavorless tomatoes on it. Sorry, I just hate pale tomatoes; if they are not in season or ripe, please spare me. The lettuce was iceberg, not the biggest deal. It had tahini on it, so that was right.   I don't think I will go back to see if they use higher quality ingredients in other menu items.",

My favorite were the falafel, but then again I wasn't the biggest fan of the tahini sauce that came with it. As someone else mentioned, the water glasses were never re-filled and the music in the background was so loud that it was a bit disturbing. For my main I had a simple chicken kebab with rice and I really liked it. The meat was tender and the flavors really nice. The price is quite decent for the portions you get. All the food was fresh and made with good ingredients.

    "text": "Ever since I came back from spring break in Greece, I have been obsessed with Mediterranean food. I hadn't explored many of the aforementioned cuisine here in Pittsburgh, though. I found this place and it looked great. Upon walking into the dining room, I knew that I would have a great experience. Not being super hungry, we just ordered an appetizer sampler and a Greek salad. This was enough to fill me up, surprisingly. The sampler was the best option in order to maximize utility for your dollar. The Greek salad was very fresh. I always like to try new things and so I ordered a Camlica. It was a carbonated beverage similar to a Sprite and very delicious! I will be back soon to try more!",

First I'll talk about the service, I agree with most of the reviews about being understaffed because there was only one girl waiting on all the tables (not busy yet still not attentive to customers needs? Super nice though). I feel bad because I did notice the \"HELP WANTED\" sign, so they're searching!! The owner, on the other hand, is INCREDIBLY accommodating!!! Brought my dog and sat down with my friends (who grabbed a table outside) then the owner politely asked me to anchor him onto a tree on the sidewalk then suggested we sit on the sidewalk and put together tables for us :) options is always a wonderful thing!!  Now the best part, FOOD!! Let me just say that this chicken on the chicken salad I had was probably one of the best chicken I've ever had in my life-- tender, cooked perfectly. Tried my friend's hummus and dip (I forget what it was called but it was red) oh my goodness... So smooth, creamy yet bursting with flavor every bite!! Pita bread = perfection and warm.  Love this place!! Can't wait to try more!!",

It was made with Surek - described as a beef pepperoni - which intrigued me to try it. Essentially, the panini was a spicy meatball sandwich.  At the time of this review, the cafe was understaffed; however, it is searching for new employees, so I expect that to change soon.",

We still get the mediterranean dip with extra pita and really anything with gyro meat though we've had chicken, adana/lamb, and falafel. One thing that is great news for us is that Daphne Cafe is pup friendly on the patio so long as your dog is on a leash. It was a hot day on our most recent visit and upon our request they brought out a bowl of ice for our pup who loved it.",

The outside patio is nice and there were couples and larger parties enjoying each other right on Ellsworth.  We split the Kisir as an appetizer - it was a grain type spread and served with pita bread.  It was prepared with the perfect amount and combination of spices.  A very different flavor than I was expecting, but still very good.  Their pita bread was warm and fluffy and perfect!  I ordered the Aegean salad and it had a very nice house dressing on it.  Bobby got their savory pocket and while he didn't love it; he didn't hate it either.  I had a bite - it was good, but I probably would have tried something else!  We split their baklava...incredible. Literally, mouthwatering.    The service was very friendly -  wouldn't mind going back just because I feel healthy when I am eating Mediterranean food and it was a nice, quaint little atmosphere for a date before stepping out for some drinks.",

You could tell that there was pride in every plate served.  The owner asked if he could pull up a chair to talk after we finished eating.  He joined us for a bit of very enjoyable conversation.

The Mediterranean dip with warm pita was delicious.  It was mostly tomato based with olives, walnuts and a drizzle of olive oil.  The stuffed grape leaves were tender with a hint of citrus, served with tzatziki sauce.  The Greek salad was your standard and was decent as Greek salads go.  Iskender kabap was the entree.  It was Gyro meat in a nice tomato broth over pita with a few grilled peppers and tomato.  The Baklava was probably the best I have ever tasted.  I was not blown away by anything that we ate and, for my taste buds ... I wish it was a bit more spicy and I did need to add some salt.

We waited a little, but our waitress made sure to take care of us when she could.   I got the doner salad which was a decent size. The lamb was well-seasoned and the vegetables were fresh.   Try the aryan if you're feeling adventurous. It's a salty yogurt drink. They make it fresh, which is far better than the bottled version at the local middle eastern stores.   I wouldn't recommend this place for date night unless you get outdoor seating. The inside is a bit sparse and casual. Outside would be great. The bride and groom clearly thought so.",

I'm a big fan of good service (gee... who isn't!?) but I tend to give A LOT of leeway to people because I was a server.  Today, it was hard for me to do so.    The hummus was actually really good and the pita bread was awesome.  Came out warm and moist.  The gyro salad was not bad.  I liked the meat, but it was a pretty simple salad.  I've had much more creative/better ones.    I think I'd give it another try because I did like the hummus, but I pray the service gets better because I may start throwing around some pita bread... if I ever got some extra slices!",

The portions are big! It's a very cute atmosphere. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it's kinda a small, tight place! It's different, the owner's are nice...the waitress wasn't the friendliest, it took awhile to receive some of the things we asked for, but that was understandable! They had two parties of about 12-15 people each in the main dining area, we asked the waitress if it was a normal Sunday for them or busier than usual. She said it was busier than normal. The prices are so reasonable and cheap..especially for the quality, delicious food that they serve! Not only do they have middle Eastern/Turkish food, they have some american options for a picky eater or someone who is just isn't in the mood for middle Eastern food! Definitely will be returning to Daphne's cafe!",

    "text": "I want to like this place more. I really do. It's cute, well-located, low-key, inexpensive, locally-owned, and has a patio for outdoor seating. The food is even pretty good. But this place is really awkward.  We showed up for a weeknight dinner around 7:30, and there was no one seated inside, and only one large group outside. Awkward. In order to seat three, the owner had to move two tables together. Also awkward. He helped us very kindly and promptly, but he was smoking in the outdoor seating area, which was not a smoking section (I don't think, since the only ash tray there was his). Again, awkward.  So we sat and received some really awkward menus from a sweet but awkward waitress. The font is difficult to read (is that an L or a D?), the food descriptions lack consistency (is that salad on a bed of lettuce or just the other salads?), and the items on the menu are not clearly distinguished from one another (what's the difference between the gyro wrap and the gyro sandwich?).  We opened our BYO wine and things got less awkward for a while, until they brought our main dishes before we finished our appetizer. There was not enough room on the table for all that food, and even when we did finish, our table was not cleared promptly.  That said, the people who work there were very nice and accommodating, and the food wasn't bad (it also wasn't fantastic). If they re-write and re-print their menu, and smooth out their seating arrangements and timing on appetizers, this place will be just fine. I would recommend it for a quick lunch or super-casual dinner, but after this experience at Daphne, it's not a place I want to linger at through a whole bottle of wine.",

We can actually walk to Daphne Cafe and i'm really glad we found it. The first time we went, there were only a couple other people in there and we were immediately sat and our food came out quickly and was delicious. The prices you just can't beat in Shadyside and you can get a full dinner for two for around 20 bucks including an appetizer. The second time we went, we got take out and it was just as good. Friendly and courteous just as if we were sitting down. I'm very pleased to have found this place and my fiance is more than satisfied having a gyro so close to home!

The menu was mostly appetizers (baba ghannouj, hummus, etc), wraps, and salads. I had the adana (lamb) wrap, and my boyfriend has the gyro salad. His had a ton of meat compared to mine, but his salad also had a sweeter Greek salad dressing which I really liked. I liked my wrap but wish there was more meat in it. The boyfriend also had the Turkish coffee, and I had the custard dessert which was small, but VERY filling. We might be coming back since we realized Daphne was BYOB (corkage fee was 3 or 4 bucks). I wish there were more entrees on the list, but it would make more sense next time to split some of the appetizers and maybe a salad as a main dish.",

The event was incredible. We held the party in their party room downstairs in the basement, which is gorgeous. It is decorated beautifully and has seating around the perimeter of the room, allowing for mingling and lots of conversation. The food was (as always) also fantastic - I would highly recommend the Iskendar! The couple that owns the restaurant are lovely and so friendly... they did not just cater, they HOSTED the event. They were downstairs with us, encouraging us to have a good time and generally making sure everything was as we wanted it. We felt like part of the family! All our friends and relatives have commented on how delicious the food was, and how unique and special the evening was. I would highly recommend Daphne's if you want to hold a special event, or just for a casual evening dinner. We certainly love it and will continue to go back often!!",

While the Baba app was good, the rest of the food was mediocre at best when it finally did arrive about 40 minutes later (I'd asked for more pita bread for the apps which was never brought until the rest of the food arrived). Waitress (and owner) dropped one of the sandwiches on the floor bringing it to the table - I would have normally always sent this back, but we had waited long enough for food already, were quite hungry, and so - as she seemed quite discombobulated at her job - graciously accepted it anyway. Then she charged full price for it on the bill on top of that! I heard a take-out customer exasperated by the high bill, as was I. Stay clear of this place: terrible service (by the owner yet), unexceptional food, and definitely overpriced. Want the best mid-eastern food in Pgh? Med Grill on Forbes in Squirrel Hill - I'm wishing we'd have gone there...",

However, I went in to take-out dinner tonight and was more than pleased with the food. I got the gyro salad, which is well worth $9 due to the amount of meat that they put on the dish. I also tried the mediterranean dip, which is a mix of roasted red peppers, feta cheese and olive oil. After sharing with two people, we still have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. I also brought home the rice pudding, which is house made and has a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. I'm a sucker for rice pudding so this was absolutely delicious. After talking with the owner while getting my take-out, my boyfriend happened to mention that he loves baklava, so the owner gave us a taste of the baklava to bring home, free of charge. His generosity was a reflection of good business, and the baklava did not disappoint. I will definitely be going back.",

So when a friend recommended coming here, I was surprised to discover this cute little cafe.  They have outdoor and indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was really cute!  On a lovely summer day, this was such a great atmosphere to have a business lunch.  I enjoyed the Baba Ganoush and falafel very much for lunch.  They provide you with plenty of pita to enjoy with your meal.  The Baba Ganoush was a very generous portion, and I actually took quite a bit home with me.  The falafel was probably the best falafel I have had in Pittsburgh.   While I didn't pay for the meal so I don't remember the exact prices, they seemed fairly reasonable at the time.  We had pretty good service throughout the meal so I think that issue has been resolved!",

Anyway, I stopped in for dinner last week on a weeknight. As could be predicted, it wasn't very busy so we had the full attention of the staff. I ordered the red lentil soup and the Daphne mixed veg platter.  The lentil soup was smooth overall, but I periodically picked up a small amount of crunch that felt like a mistake. Probably won't order that again.  However, the main dish came out pretty much perfect. The grape leaves and hummus especially were good, so if you're looking to order appetizers, I would strongly recommend those.  Overall very happy, will return",

The place was hardly packed but our server never filled our water, asked how the meal was, or cleared the table. I overlooked that but the fact that they never told us how to pay so we sat there waiting like idiots was my biggest complaint.  The waitress didn't particularly seem to enjoy working so it left us feeling a little awkward.    So besides the service the food was good - not great.  I went with a group and we ordered a mozzarella panini, daphne panini, gyro panini, and gyro wrap along with a side of fries. My friends got the turkish coffee which came out in these really cute ornate cups but it wasn't a lot considering the fact that you pay 2 dollars for a little more than a mouthful of coffee.  Careful though, it's pretty strong.   I wasn't particularly blown away with the food, the gyro wrap didn't have enough sauce on it so the wrap seemed a bit dry.  The daphne panini wasn't to my taste and seemed exceptionally simple for something that was supposed to be \"special.\"   Overall, I don't think I'll come back, but the restaurant did have a great feel to it.  The outdoor seating seemed popular on the day that we went.",

We had a choice of lots of restaurants in the neighborhood and because we have kids that are picky eaters made sure to check out the menu on line before coming here. There was no kids menu, but online there was a fried chicken (shnitzel) on the platter list and french fries so we decided to come. When we got to the restaurant, the menu didn't have fried chicken, but had grilled chicken kebobs for $13.95 that came with 2 sides, except that french fries were listed separately, not on the \"sides\".  Even though our kids don't like grilled chicken, we though we would made do and asked the waitress if the kids could have french fries as their ONLY side with the kebobs instead of the choice of 2 \"sides\" (salad, rice, yogurt, etc). The answer was a rude no, we had to order fries as extra. We explained all of the above and it was still no, so we asked to speak with the manager/chef. She came over and was as rude.  Said they won't accommodate and we had to order additional fries as a separate extra order. We were with people that come there all the time, and I explained that I felt uncomfortable with this -- we had already ordered each child a lemonade and an appetizer for the table and together with all of this, it wasn't right the way we were being treated. They were basically taking advantage of the fact that we have kids--looking to charge $20 for each child to eat there (chicken kebob, fries, drink). Outrageous. Only after I made a big fuss, the owner/chef begrudgingly agreed claiming that it was only because we came there with other \"regulars\". We felt so unwelcome. We left and went to Urban Tap instead where we were treated with respect and understanding.",

On with the review -  I had the HOME MADE (in house) Turkish Doner (Gyro) with Bulgar along with side salad.  Exceptional - rare to find homemade Doner - so when I found this place I was psyched - and it exceeded expectations.  The Doner is thinly shaved and has an added peppery flavor.  Also tried the bulgar, which was great.  This was my second night - the first night I tried the sampler platter which included Flavor filled Lamb Chops, Moderately spiced  yet flavorful Adana kabob, MOIST and tender chicken breast kabob and the Doner.  All were superb.  Truly Authentic Turkish meal.  Try the Non-GMO Organic Turkish Tea - be sure to ask how it's grown.  Overall experience was great - The owners were warm and welcoming - they enjoy sharing their culture. The music added to the experience - was able to decompress from the day and do some reading while eating.  Felt like an evening at a friend's place relaxing.  Great find indeed!",

If you like lamb, their iskender kebab is really really good too.   They have a cute patio that provides a wonderful place to hang out when it is warm outside.",

Started with the mixed appetizer, Hummus, Ezme (vegetable side dish) and Eggplant with sauce (opted for it cold)  with fresh warm pita and cacik to dip. Everything on this plate was delicious. Also split a gyro wrap. The lamb was so tender and the flavors of the wrap came together nicely. There was one lady working so hard. She was very helpful. Glad we stopped. Hope to get back there soon!",

My boyfriend always gets the Doner Kebab and is always very full afterwards. I tend to get the Daphne Mixed Veggie and oh my goodness the hummus is the smoothest, richest hummus I think I've ever had. I absolutely love it. The cacik is also great and everything else that is included is fantastic.   The only two drawbacks I have are the falafel does tend to be on the dry side, so I end up having to pay for an extra side of sauce (usually cacik) to make up for it. This goes for when I order the falafel wrap or salad as well. The second more of a heads up: if you order take out, make sure to check your order before you leave. Three times I have gotten home and assumed that the extra sauce or pita was packed in the individual entree containers to find that it wasn't there. I love the cacik so much that I've walked back and they've given it to me, no problem. And it's also my fault that I haven't learned by now to check. So I just want to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else who lives further away. :)   Overall, really great food for a decently reasonable price.",

The first few times I came here the food was good but the service was kind of meh.  The food has improved, and so has the service!  I think they just needed to work the kinks out.  Let me tell you something:  there's little I wont do for hummus, and they've got great hummus here.  Everything tastes fresh and is inexpensive.  It's not a fancy restaurant, but its a nice restaurant and the past two times I've been here everything has been great.    If you havent tried this restaurant I suggest you do so now, bc its been increasingly crowded with each return, I think word is getting out.",

    "text": "I love Turkish food and was excited to try this quaint, family-owned restaurant nestled on Ellsworth Ave in Shadyside. The dining area is beautifully decorated and they also have an adorable outdoor space in which it would be lovely to enjoy a meal on a nice day (it was a tad chilly when we went, so we opted to dine indoors).  There was one waitress and while she was a little stoic in demeanor, she was perfectly polite and very attentive. We started with the pilaki appetizer, which were pinto beans, tomatoes, onions and garlic with olive oil. It was served with a round of pita bread. It was really delicious! The beans were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The pita bread was probably the best I've ever had...the perfect level of soft and fluffy. I wish they would've given more than one pita round though, as we had a lot of extra pilaki and would have liked to have eaten it with more bread (and especially considering the price, it seems like they can spare more than one pita round).  For dinner, my husband ordered the doner (gyro) kabob, which was sliced pieces of lamb served with white rice and cacik (yogurt sauce). He reported that the meat was tender and well-seasoned and the cacik was a perfect complement to his meal. For myself, I got the chicken kabob with rice and bulgur pilaf (subbed for fries, which seems like an odd side dish to serve with Turkish food). The chicken was very flavorful, although a bit dry. The portion of rice and bulgur were very generous, but a bit bland (rice, of course, is usually bland, but I had higher hopes for the pilaf). I stole a bit of my husband's cacik and mixed it into my meal, and it improved the flavor tremendously. Next time I'll order some of my own.   Overall, the food is made fresh and it's much healthier than traditional restaurant offerings, and I'm a fan of that. However, in terms of taste, it was a mixed bag. And prices are high. Considering all of that, I'd say it was a 3.5 star meal. I'd definitely return at some point, but it's not somewhere that I'm going to rush back to.",

The food was so fresh and so delicious! We rented the dining area downstairs for a party of 20+. It was decorated beautifully and had these cool couches to sit on. We started off with the appetizer which was a salad, tabouli, a sauteed eggplant dish which was my favorite, a sour cream dip with crunchy nuts,  cous cous, and pita. That was followed by a sauteed steak with sour cream. Next was my the main dish of grilled lamb, chicken, and salmon. It was really delicious. I haven't had something that tasty in a while. So impressed! Finally, as if all this wasnt enough we had a trifecta of desserts! A rice pudding with cinnamon and possibly cardamom? Baklava with pistachios and a tiramisu! I'm so full but ready to go again! Wonderful food from a wonderful family!",

The lamb was cooked and seasoned well. The kofte was also good but came in tomato sauce, which in my experience is unusual and which I had missed on the menu. If you are in the minority and don't like tomato sauce (like me), it is easy to just use a knife and remove the sauce from the kofte. That's what I did and I was able to enjoy the kofte more.

    "text": "As far as Turkish cuisine goes, Daphne is definitely my favorite of the options in Pittsburgh. I guess if your Turkish friends say it's their favorite, as well, I can be optimistic that my tastebuds aren't too far off. The atmosphere is very casual and simple, but don't let that fool you. The food is spectacular!  We usually go in groups of 4+, so we always share mixed appetizer plates and get most of the apps on the menu. You really can't go wrong with any of the starters, but I'm obsessed with their eggplant with sauce. If I have to round out my perfect mixed app order, I'd add the Mediterranean dip and Lebni, then devour it all with a big smile on my face. The portions are such that you'll rarely have enough pita initially.  My go-to platter is the Iskender Kebab: Doner kebab over diced pita with melted butter, sauce, yogurt and tomato. It's definitely a lot of food to down, but it's delicious and I order it...every...single...time. Their sauce isn't watered down, the pita isn't too soggy most of the time, and they're generous with the yogurt. It's a great combination of flavors, temperatures, and textures. My wife is obsessed with the Adana, and I've tried the lamb chops, chicken and plain doner kebab. All delicious. If you can't decide, just order the mixed grill, but I'd definitely say the Iskender is still my favorite dish that I've tried.  The staff has always been nice to us. I love that it's a family-run business. Literally a husband, wife, and their daughter manning the restaurant, almost exclusively. The plus side of such an operation is the pride that goes into the food and the real appreciation that they seem to show the customers. The downside to such a small operation is that service can be slow, especially in larger groups and peak times. Daphne isn't a place that you choose if you're in a rush. We've always made an event of it, whether for dinner or lunch. If you have the patience, though, the food certainly won't disappoint! The apps will come out quickly to satiate your initial hunger, but the platters may take a while. Of course, as a BYOB establishment, I'm sure you'll be able to occupy yourself while waiting for your entree.   For dessert, the Baklava is the safe bet, but the Kunefe is the real winner for me. Shredded wheat layers, with a sweet cheese filling, topped with syrup and pistachio. If you haven't had it, I definitely recommend. It's such a savory, yet sweet dessert. Served warm, it's simply phenomenal! Just be aware that it takes about 20 minutes, so order when your entree arrives to speed things up!  Overall, Daphne is a great place for a group. You won't feel rushed, the food is wonderful, and you're supporting an appreciative family-run business. Aside from slower service, Daphne really is an unassuming gem in the city!",

    "text": "I went here with my friends and looking forward to some authentic Turkish food from all the raving reviews however it was definitely not authentic.   We ordered their iskendar kebob, chicken kebab and kofte. their iskendar meat was bland, dry and in a pool of ketchup sauce. their so called kofte is meatball texture, very chewy and definitely not sirloin steak as their menu states. it came with fries which I did not fancy so we had a side salad with it. Very mediocre food and definitely could be better.   it's byob but there's a $5 cork fee so I'd bring my own cork to save some money. Turkish coffee however is weak and appetizers are your norm you get anywhere u go which was tolerable.   Service is okay and the atmosphere is more like a cafeteria. not coming here and not worth the drive.",

She would remind us that there would be extra charges for which we were okay with. She seemed annoyed and eager to see us out.  Of note, this has happened at a previous occasion with another group.

The restaurants is family owned, which becomes clear as soon as you're greeted by the owner himself! Him and his wife run the kitchen, and it's not uncommon to be treated to a free glass of wine (if you forget to bring your own) or appetizer.   Speaking of appetizers, the Trio is excellent as it lets you sample three different appetizers. I recommend the homemade hummus, the Mediterranean dip, and whatever else you'd like to add. Everything is delicious and fresh.   For my entree, I without a doubt order the Iskender kebab plate every time. Delicious kebab meat and pita bread soaked in a buttery tomato-based sauce with fresh yogurt to complement it. So. Freaking. Good. It's a little pricey ($17) but it is absolutely worth it.   All in all, this place continues to top my list as a Pittsburgh favorite and one that I return to again and again.",

The pricing was a little steep but the place itself looked super cute, which seemed to have an outdoor area for warmer days, which is presently covered in this awful white stuff. The falafel was very tasty, as the tahini, which had a different taste than what I'm used to and seemed to have a little peanut buttery taste to it. The baba ghanouj was delicious. They definitely don't short you on pita, and I wish I'd known that before I ordered extra.",

First, the marinated chicken and lamb options are significantly better than the falafel. I really did not like the falafel. Take a walk 2 blocks over to Turkish kebab house if you want fantastic falafel. This place has more options for salads than TKH, which is why i would go here. The salads are tasty, and the Greek dressing seems homemade. Also It is BYOB and has a fun patio to have a blast in the summer.  The Turkish coffee is really excellent here, and highly recommend.",

There are some unusual dishes on the menu, but also some familiar foods that Daphne makes really well. The Babaghanoush and Falafel are the best I've found.  I recommend the Mixed Appetizer, which allows you to sample 3 choices. Try something new, order the Ezme!  I was interested in some of the artwork, and our server answered all of my questions.

It's more of a sit-down restaurant rather than fast food, you'll get table service.  The falafel I ordered was fine - I certainly had tastier ones (overall it was bit dry and I was missing some more yogurt sauce). By reading the reviews here I was surprised that \"friendliness\" was mentioned by almost every Yelper. I didn't get a smile and a rather cold sent-off when I paid my $9.10 falafel with a $10 - not sure if tip was expected!",

We got the combo platter which was enough food for 2. The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned. I could have continued to eat even though I was full. We finished it off with the most perfect of desserts. The rice pudding. Never have I had rice pudding that was as creamy as this. It just married your tastebuds with the slight citrus flavor and perfectly cooked rice. Seriously, I would eat it over ice cream any day!",

    "text": "How have I gone a year without knowing there is a delicous doner kebab for sale 10 minutes from my office?!   For those that are unaware, doner kebab is the Turkish equivalent of a Greek gyro (they bill them as gyros here, I think to alleviate confusion). Only it is not equivalent at all, but rather better in every way! The meat is less greasy, and more identifiably lamb (I had someone explain to me once that this is due to doner being halal and gyros, not so much... might be BS, or not). And the accompaniments are better: actual green lettuce, tomato chunks, thin slices of marinated red onions in lieu of giant hunks of raw white ones. And the Turkish yogurt sauce, cacik, while theoretically the same thing, is always somehow lighter and less sour-cream-like than Greek tzatziki.   Can't speak to the service, as I had take out, but that was quick. Waited 5 minutes and had a nice chat with the owner about my 3 months as a student in Berlin (where doner kebab is everywhere). Business seemed slow for a lunch hour, but this seemed to have no negative affect on the food I had, which was fresh, hot, and delicious.   Will certainly be back soon!",

I walk by it every day and it seemed like the place I would get lunch from on the weekends or grab a dinner to go on the way home from work.  After one trip, I haven't been back.  I really appreciate it when restaurants post their menu online; as a vegetarian I can be prepared to go elsewhere if there's nothing on the menu.  Daphne doesn't have a website, but there is now a photo of the menu on urbanspoon.  Sometimes they have a chalkboard with the menu taped to it outside the door.  We went to Daphne to get dinner to go, and it was a disappointment.  Their credit card machine was broken, which I can understand, but they didn't tell us until after they had taken our order and put it in.  I got the veggie wrap, which was some sad lettuce, tomatoes, and onions on hummus.  The gyro looked much more satisfying than my meal for sure.    The restaurant is never busy, despite the reasonable prices and BYOB.  Maybe it will pick up in the spring when the patio seating opens.",

Just some very basic table and chairs and light music.  It looks more like a lunch place.    However, when we glanced at the menu we decided we would give it a try.  For an appetizer, I had the humus and a yogurt type dip (sorry forget the name!).  Both were excellent!    And then I ordered the fresh mozzarella panini, which came with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomatos on a buttered panini bread.  Quite tasty!!!    Definitely will be back.  I don't know that I would plan on coming to this place for a nice meal on the weekend due to their being no ambiance, but definitely would come here for lunch or a quick bite to eat at night.",

For starters, we ordered an appetizer sampler, in which we got their mild, but delectable hummus, their mediterranean dip, and their ezme salad.  All three were gone quickly enough, and the mediterranean dip was full of flavor in all the best ways.  The appetizers in general were wondrous.  For an entree, I ordered a gyro platter, or something of the sort: I can't remember the exact name.  It was also pretty good, but in contrast to the appetizers and the desserts, the consensus around the table was that the entrees were something this fledgling business might still be working on a bit.  It was tasty, but could have used some work in presentation and perceived quality.  For dessert, we split a pistachio roll, and this alone sold us on the place: It was perfectly portioned to be split among three or four people, and the flavor was both unlike anything we had had before, and impossible to criticize.    Another perk of the place is the Turkish tea, which is mild, slightly sweet, and of a decent quality as teas go.  This is a place I would recommend (they're new, and it would be excellent to see more people going there!) and it is a place to which all three of us will return.",

The owner himself stopped over to welcome us, and after hearing we'd been to Istanbul and had the baklava there, he was generous enough to give our table some of their baklava to try.

We were a group of four and we decided to have a table outdoor which was really nice. We enjoyed our food so much and we are definitely coming back for all heavenly grilled meat and kabobs!",

    "text": "This is a great hidden gem in Shadyside. We arrived around 8pm for dinner and sat on their patio-which is perfect for warm weather dining. The service is very prompt and attentive. We started out with the Mediterranean dip with warm pita. It was a great mix of flavors, however you must like tomatoes as the main ingredient is tomato paste. We ordered the doner platter to share and it came with a large amount of shaved lamb, rice, cacik along with grilled tomatoes and peppers. The ingredients were all very fresh and tasty. Make sure to order turkish coffee at the end of your meal along with some baklava! Also, they are byob if you are in the mood to bring along some wine.",

    "text": "I have been here two or three times. While the food is okay and good, I find it to be bland and dry sometimes. Given that there are a lot of other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food close by, it is hard to come back here. But still, the food is decent. I do not like that there is no single veggie that accompanies the food. Usually in all the middle easter restaurants I have been to, when you order an entree (kabob dish, etc.) there are a few veggies for the crunchiness and as a refreshment. But in Daphne, the dish comes without anything, not even a single pickle. So, it is hard to eat, it feels very dry.",

It came with a cool and refreshing cucumber yogurt that balanced out the rougher texture and savory flavor of the lamb. Be aware though that the plate ONLY comes with meat and rice. That's it. So if you're looking for some veggies, you'll have to order that separately.",

Personally I think they make the best grape leaves in the city, better than Salam market's. The real surprise is the Iskender kabap. The gyro meat is tender and is perfected by the tomato sauce. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Greek food but seek more flavor. Service is good too. Come here on a sunny day for lunch, sit outside and you are in for a treat!",

I don't recommend getting a chicken wrap, because the tortilla wrap is too thin. I wish they used actual pita instead of a tortilla wrap. I've had chicken with the rice as well. It is good, but they don't give any sauces with it. That would be the suggestion I have for them: garlic, tahini sauce or something with meal",

    "text": "Daphne Cafe offers phenomenal and unique Turkish cuisine with small business charm.  My significant other and I have been going to the Daphne Cafe for over a year. We love the family who owns the restaurant and the delicious offerings.   The atmosphere in the dining room is slightly less than desirable as the noise level gets very loud even with just one noisy patron. The tile floors and sparse white decorations give a slightly cold, sterile, and uninviting vibe. In the summer, the patio can't be beat with the shrubs and umbrellas. You really feel cut off from the noise of Ellsworth Avenue and secluded in your own little Turkish getaway. Daphne is the perfect place to unwind. It is BYOB  The menu is large but I tend to stick with my favorites. The lentil soup is incredible and unique. The soup is blended and very smooth. The flavors are complex. Even during the hottest days of summer, I have a hard time resisting the lentil soup. The panini are always cooked to perfection and fresh. I prefer the Daphne panini, a combination of Turkish pepperoni and provolone cheese, and the tomato mozzarella panini with huge basil leaves. The salads are also fresh and delicious. I've also had great experiences with their appetizers. My personal favorite is the smyrna dip, yogurt and eggplant pureed together.   The only pitfall if you are in a hurry, is the service. The owners are friendly and wonderful, but very slow. I like to think that in their culture dining is a leisurely experience and they want to treat you to a great meal. But sometimes I feel forgotten, especially if we're waiting on change at the end of the meal. That definitely doesn't keep me away from Daphne since their takeout is fast and well prepared.   Keep an open mind and enjoy!",
