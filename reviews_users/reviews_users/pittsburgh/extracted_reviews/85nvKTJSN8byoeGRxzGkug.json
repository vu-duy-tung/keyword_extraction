My wife had the Acapulco express, which she said could have had more chorizo. I had the traditional eggs Benedict, which was excellent. We split a side of potatoes which lacked some flavor. Overall I was impressed, I was worried this place was all about oatmeal's and eggs, but it had some great combinations for breakfast. 4/5 for lack of meat and a flavorless potatoe side.",

Every single week. This place has become our Sunday tradition because it's so good. And this is coming from people that go to breakfast A LOT. I think for about 6 months now we haven't gone anywhere else. First things first, they have really good coffee. I'm not a coffee snob or anything but this is just very tasty. Their breakfasts are awesome, I always get either the breakfast tacos or the Chickichanga.  This is the only place I've ever been that uses chicken in some breakfast meals. Why isn't that ingredient used more?  Hubby usually gets one of those or an omelet and they're SO good.  They have this energy drink of blended fruits and veggies called Day Glow that we love. And to top it all off, you can use the NoWait app to reserve a spot in line from home then just show and be seated even when it's super crowded. I LOVE IT!!",

The new restaurant is open and the decor welcoming. We had to wait about a half hour for a table, but the hostess and everyone were very nice. It being my first time I wasn't prepared to order, but on someone's advice I ordered the Power Breakfast Quinoa Bowl. What is Quinoa? I had no idea at the time and still really don't, but it doesn't have much flavor. I had to dump some hot sauce on it to spice it up. My brother eats healthier than myself really likes the Pesto Chicken Power Bowl. I'll definitely return and try to be more prepared.",

We started out going to Totin's, but the portions were out of control and the food was too greasy.  We both live in Los Angeles, which is a breakfast/brunch haven, and First Watch would definitely hold its own in La La Land.  We were able to get a table very easily on weekday mornings and on the weekend you can get on the waitlist ahead of arrival through Yelp.  The wait can be long on the weekend, so I highly recommend using the Yelp waitlist function.  Once you're checked in, you can watch your progress on the app as well.  Throughout our residency eating here six days in a row, we fell in love with the Market Skillet Hash, the Elevated Egg Sandwich, and the Chickichanga.  All of the food is super fresh and the breakfast potatoes are yummy.  We also really liked all of our servers - friendly and attentive.  We will be back when we're in town for the holidays!",

I'd never been to one of these before, knowing it's a chain, so I was looking forward to trying it out.  I love a good hash. Something about all the breakfast incidents all mixed into one bowl does the job for me, so I ordered the farm stand hash. The hash was good, but needed more flavor, so I threw on a dash of salt and pepper. I did like how crispy the bacon was, so extra points for that.   I also got greedy and ordered a side of carrot cake pancakes. Now carrot cake is one of my all time faves, so I was super excited about it. It was a let down though. Didn't really taste like anything to be honest, least of all carrot cake. I keep thinking about the side of bread I got with the hash though. Do they make it in house? Or buy it locally? It was some sort of thick cut grain bread and it was fabulous!   Their menu is huge, so I'd be down to try lunch at some point too, especially if it included that delicious bread again!",

(Instead of noisy directly across from the bathrooms).   I had a Chorizo Omelet, which was good, but still I could easily make this at home. I wanted to try the breakfast potatoes just by themselves, and once again they were bland and just not delicious. Artisan bread still tasty, and the preserves were a bit less sweet and I could actually enjoy with my bread.  In the end, I don't think this place is for me. I can name several other breakfast places I would rather go to first for better food at a better price. They do seem to fill a niche with their juice bar and the power bowls....",

All of the ones I've seen have a large communal table, in case the wait is too long and you want to grab open seating there.  I love the menu options (healthy and lunch options are both included, not just breakfast) and the food is always good.  It was super busy when we visited (Black Friday) but once our server got to us everything was smooth.  I think First Watch is the best of the breakfast chains these days.  We like First Watch and Cracker Barrel both, but Cracker Barrel is a little more traditional and less heathy.  I'd always choose First Watch over IHOP or others for breakfast, or even breakfast for lunch.",

I have dined here several times and have no complaints other than I wish they were open later. There's days when it's dinner time and I am craving First Watch but they sadly close at 2:30.   There isn't a bad thing on the menu. I have had the crepes with a muffin, the breakfast sandwich with potatoes and a turkey burger. All were extremely delicious! It is really the perfect brunch spot with so many different options to pick from. Everyone loves options! One thing I truly love about this spot is the food always tastes fresh. If you are in the mood for something healthy they have something you will enjoy or if you are looking to satisfy your waffle / pancake cravings they have those too! I met up with a friend and her daughter around 10 o'clock Saturday and there was a 45 minute wait. So the earlier you go I think the better it will be if you do not have time to wait. We didn't mind because we had a lot of catching up too do! This will always be my spot to grab brunch in the north hills area :)",

It is a little pricey compared to surrounding areas, but you really are paying for quality & service. The interior is upscale/modern with rustic decor, ambience is casual. They have outdoor seating as well. I ordered Eggs Florentine Benedict  & it was SO fresh tasting. They used ciabatta bread instead of an English muffin which was very pleasing. Side of lightly dressed greens helped the meal to not be so heavy. I will definitely be back.",

We initially wanted to sit outside but decided we were too hungry to wait.  Our food did not take long once we ordered. I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine which they serve on ciabatta bread. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Side of greens went perfect with it. Really well done and beautifully plated. I should've taken a photo but it looked so good I just dove in!  The restaurant itself is cute....it's a large bright room with farmer's market type decor. You can see into the kitchen. There are lots of windows on the street side and therefore lots of light. Wood elements warm up the space.    You pay the bill at the register not the table. This must speed up table turnover and allow the wait staff to concentrate on service. Smart.  I can't wait to go back!  It will be difficult to decide between ordering the benedict again or trying something else.",

The food here is fresh, with plenty of options for specific dieters (Vegetarian, vegan, paleo, keto, etc.).  I've never had anything at First Watch I did not like.   Be sure to use the nowait or first watch app to get in line before you arrive. I've seen many unhappy customers receive the news they will have to wait, while other people seemingly just walk in and are seated. On the l=plus side, they have complimentary coffee for people who are waiting, so there is that.  I will say the service at this location has always been... terse. Always friendly, but very quick to move, to produce a receipt, etc.   When I plan for a day of shopping in the area, I always start at First Watch to get a great meal before running around.",

Additionally, the first time the food was nothing impressive, but now I am not back a year later and I had a great experience. The waitress was very kind, let me substitute menu items without hesitation, and the food was delicious. I had the Elevated Egg Sandwich and my friend had the Farmhouse Skillet Hash.

I previously ate at the location in Cranberry and thought I enjoyed that experience enough to be excited about visiting this First Watch today.  But I must say, this set up feels so much better and it tops the Cranberry location by far.  We were warmly greeted  upon entering and were quickly seated.  I am sure timing was on our side for getting seated right away.  I am certain  they  usually encounter  fairly large crowds on a regular basis because of their limited hours of 7:00AM to 2:30 PM Monday-Sunday.  They do suggest trying their \"Seat & Eat\" quick order option.  It's basically having  your order already recorded and once you are seated the food preparation begins.  The dining room is very open and comfortable.  The design is such that they can easily transform their tables and chairs into dining for 4 or 14 all with a twist of a table or two. Smart. From what I gathered, the rustic theme of the restaurant is centered around several of the oversized wooden beams that came from a barn that had been torn down and repurposed throughout the dining space. They have bushel basket light fixtures hanging from the ceiling which further adds to the theme as well.  But the real treat is their fresh and exciting healthy menu options.  The choices are plentiful and unique. One bite of my club sandwich and soup said it all.  They know what they are doing and they do it well!!  My friends salad was appealing and plentiful. We left feeling nourished and completely satisfied knowing that we chose right and decided we are going to make it a point to come here on a routine basis.",

I came with my toddler twins (which even on the best days can be a challenge or cause glares from servers) but they grabbed me two highchairs quickly and helped us to our table.  It was definitely appreciated.   The menu had both breakfast and lunch options.  I was almost overwhelmed because basically everything sounded incredibly tasty.  I ended up ordering the chile chorizo omelet.  It was a smart choice.  I loved everything about it.  The chorizo had a great flavor with just the right amount of spice and all the ingredients were portioned appropriately.  I chose the potatoes as my side (you could also choose a salad) and they were tasty as well. My kids had the bacon and eggs.  We chose scrambled eggs and they were light and fluffy and the first thing the kids ate.  It came with a small side of fruit which was fresh and tasty.  They (surprisingly) wouldn't eat the bacon so I did.  It made me instantly glad they were boycotting that day because it was crisp and filled with flavor.  So much so that I almost ordered an extra side of bacon. The staff was extremely accommodating.  They were even helpful when my son threw his water on the ground.  They quickly brought a new cup and didn't give me any odd looks or make snarky comments about it (which I have actually had happen...).  They were attentive to our needs without being overbearing.  They also took time to explain the restaurant concept and menu to us when I told them it was our first visit. I'm not sure how often we'll be back because it is a bit out of the way for us, but I really enjoyed our meal and hope to return again soon.",

While I'm sure many of the menu items are high calorie, nothing on the menu is patently unhealthy. They also do fresh veg/fruit juices. I love the kale tonic. I've been here twice so far and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The service is also very friendly and attentive.",

They provide a carafe of coffee at your table so you never have to wait for a refill, and they have three creamer options on the table.  The menu is pretty diverse from your classic eggs, meat and potatoes, to steel cut oatmeal and plenty of varieties of eggs Benedict dishes!  I tried the farmhouse hash which had fire roasted tomatoes, avocado, onions and potatoes topped with two eggs plus a side of potatoes and toast.   Needless to say, it was so much food that I couldn't clean my plate.  I also tried the seasonal cinnamon chip pancakes which were delicious.  Everything is tasty and fresh.  Great breakfast spot although it's about $10 per plate.",

We arrived to a 25-30 min wait, but no worries, we just checked in to No Wait, and bummed around McCandless Crossing. We were seated right on time and greeted promptly. I was impressed by the fresh juice bar, and complimentary coffee in the lobby. I myself ordered the pesto chicken quinoa bowl, and The Legend ordered the Trifecta. We also tried the SOD, Creamy Chicken w/ Wild Rice. Everything was absolutely fantastic! We were impressed with the higher touches the most, like our own carafe of chilled water, personal pot of coffee, and warmed maple syrup for The Legend's Belgian waffle. Service was friendly and efficient, and everyone seemed to work well as a team. We will definitely be back, as here are 20 more things on the menu we'd like to try!",

The iced tea was delicious, and the poor waitress was able to keep up with my seemingly unquenchable thirst!  When the food came, man, were the portions generous!  My roast beef sandwich on sourdough was absolutely delicious, especially when I dabbed a little of the creamy horseradish sauce on it.  The half salad was huge and even came with grilled chicken on it, which I wasn't expecting.  The dressing was sweet, but not overbeating and I loved the combination of avocado with the salad.  My mom's BLTE also left her one happy diner and we both can't wait to come back for more!!",

The decor feels cozy and intimate, even though a large community table can seat about a dozen people. It also boasts freshly made food, ingredients straight from a farm, made in their kitchen (not sure how much I believe that claim though).  The service has always been adequate and friendly. My only gripe with First Watch is their lack of allergen-options (seriously - what year is it now - EVERYONE has an allergen friendly menu). Though I am grateful for the fresh juice options, there are not many options for vegans without having to play some serious dietary menu-scrabble. I get sad when a big group wants to go here, because I know it's a Juice and Coffee for me, while everyone else gets a hearty meal.  Overall - I know that most \"breakfast\" places won't be vegan friendly, since eggs, cheese and baby piglets are the \"centerpieces\" for Americans eating breakfast. But a non-dairy butter option, like Earth Balance or Olivio, would be nice. I could at least order some toast then!",

First Watch is what I think of when people say, \"Let's get brunch.\"  While I love dive-y diners for certain breakfast foods, I love the brunch that is super fresh and delicious.  I ordered the Ham and Gruyere Omelet ($10.29), which came with whole grain bread, the house strawberry preserves, and organic mixed greens.  It was delicious.  As one of the only people in the world who does not eat potatoes, I was so thrilled for the mixed greens.  They were lightly dressed and delicious.  The artisan bread is notable and fresh, and the strawberry preserves were quite delectable.  The omelet had a lot of ham and cheese, and the quality of everything was good.  The meal was filling, and I really enjoyed it.  Our server was terrible, but that seems to be an issue that others had as well.  She asked what we wanted to drink, dropped off our food, and dropped a check at the same time.  She never checked on our food.  Luckily, everything was good so it all worked out for us.",

They brought us new eggs that were better, but it wasn't until everyone else was completely done with their meals.  Our server spilled egg juice all over our table and in a coffee when she brought over the new eggs.

My boyfriend and I killed some time at the Trader Joe's across the parking lot.   Ordered the avocado toast, which came with two basted eggs. I didn't think the avocado toast was anything special, but I will always like anything with avocados as long as it's fresh and it was. I also ordered a side of potatoes (because what is brunch without potatoes?) that I did not really enjoy because the potatoes were cut into pieces that were too big and I also had to add a lot of seasoning to give it taste. I'm glad the portion size was big enough though because I knew the avocado toast and two eggs wouldn't be enough. The millionaire bacon was the best part of the brunch. It was flavorful (and just the right amount of sweet) and crispy.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 4",

I ordered the Avacado toast which was satisfying. Great multigrain bread and a huge portion of avocado. It was served with two eggs. My mom liked her omelet. My partner also had a waffle.

We got the eggs Benedict Florentine- which is cibotta bread, poached eggs, spinach, tomatoes, and hollandaise sauce. They offered eggs Benedict three different ways which I thought was cool. Our meal came with either dressed greens or breakfast potatoes. We both went with the potatoes. Our meal came out quickly and the portions were a good size.

The waiting area is small but that's why we use our house as the waiting area, haha!",

    "text": "Listen, I love First Watch. I used to go to this location EVERY Sunday before grocery shopping. I would sometimes go to this location twice a week -- I was a loyal customer. They even knew our orders by heart.   But, I have now gone to this location on TWO occasions where the manager has been blatantly rude to our face. The first time, we went on Easter Sunday. We checked in on the app to lower our wait time. I will admit, we were running late to get going and got to the restaurant a couple minutes after they suggested we do. We had gotten a notification that our table was ready before we arrived but hurried to get there. When we got to the hostess, the manager was standing there with a tablet monitoring the app check ins. We told them our names and he very angrily said \"took too long, took you off the list\", slammed his tablet down, and grabbed two menus and continued to seat us by throwing the menus on the table and walking away. I thought, whatever, we were a little late, won't happen again.   A month later, we check in on the app again, it's our routine we did it every Sunday, and we were given a time to arrive by. We head out and when we get like 10 minutes away from the restaurant, we get a notification that our table is ready. This notification comes about 20 minutes before we were told to arrive, so we let it go. We then got TWO more notifications letting us know our table is ready immediately following. We arrive at the restaurant well before our time given on the app, state our name, and the same manager is standing there with his tablet. They tell us to sit down and wait to be called. As we sit down, even after getting those notifications that our table was ready, we see the manager take his tablet over to the cashier, point to something on the tablet, and the cashier looks up at us and laughs. We made eye contact and she very quickly looked back down and he walked away real quick. It was very obvious that he was talking about how we were notified and weren't there to a cashier directly in front of us. We ended up leaving because we felt so uncomfortable and have never been back.   I loved this location, I loved the food, I loved the servers, but I do NOT plan on returning if I am going to get snark and blatant rudeness from the manager when I go there. I get that customers can be annoying, and that on Easter, we should've been more ahead of things, but he would see us there once, sometimes twice a week for years and he had the nerve to treat us that way twice, once for our mistake and another for no reason?   I will go to another First Watch now. End rant.",

Everything is always good and fresh at every first watch I've ever been to and this one isn't any different. I had the breakfast tacos and my boyfriend had the chocolate chip pancakes and both exceeded expectations. The bacon was a little weird it was almost candied but peppery, I thought it was pretty good but if you're a traditionalist I wouldn't recommend it. The kale tonic is also my favorite juice!",

You won't be disappointed! I've had a roast beef one that I try to re-create every time I have leftover roast because I still think about it. Also had a Mexican one that was phenomenal.

We had about a 15 minute drive to get there and we were arriving at a busy time of the morning (10:15 on a Saturday), but thanks to getting in line on Yelp, we only waited about 15-20 minutes when we got there, if that.   My mom tried the complimentary coffee while we waited and it was an old batch of coffee. But don't let that fool you, the fresh coffee was amazing! We both ordered the Day Glow juice which is a blend of carrot, orange, lemon and organic ginger. Absolutely refreshing!   I ordered the farmhouse skillet hash which came with potatoes, 2 eggs, avocado, and cheese and bacon, and a side of artisan toast with all natural preserves which were so sweet and delicious. I also got a small fruit cup.   We didn't wait long for our food, and our service was perfect! So glad to know about this popular brunch location in the north hills!",

Every time ive been there the waitresses or servers (whatever title you wish) have always been attentive and always willing to get something extra for you. if you do attend i suggest you ask for christina if she is working , she is bright and positive and always honest and upfront about wait times and if service is going awry. All in all i would go eat and enjoy yourself and do yourself a favor and order the orange juice.",

My absolutely favorite dish is the lemon pancakes, but those are reserved for days when I don't care about life expectancy (don't ever look up the calorie content). First Watch also offers a great Lighter Side if that's more your speed. A personal favorite is the Tri-Athlete omelette. Not only is it delicious and filling, but it makes me feel like an Olympian just for ordering it. First Watch also offers a bevy of pretty cool beverages, only a couple of which I have tried. Someday I swear I will delve more into their robust menu, but when you find things you love it's hard to deviate. Though First Watch is a chain, everything feels homemade and I really couldn't love it more; that is, unless they accepted reservations. Service can sometimes be spotty so remember to set aside a good chunk of time for your visit. Enjoy!",

My wife and I had been wanting to head to a first watch since we read about the one in Cranberry and only became more excited whenever we saw that one had opened in McCandless.  I have to admit that the inside of first watch wasn't really what I was expecting.  It was full of lots of wood (possibly reclaimed) and might look more in place out in the country.  That's not to say it wasn't charming as it was but it wasn't what I had expected.  After looking at the menu for a little while I ultimately decided on the farm stand breakfast tacos.  It was a tough decision as a lot of items on the menu are healthier and sound terrific.  That's actually one of the main reasons that we had been wanting to try it.  My tacos ended up consisting of some chorizo, eggs, avocado and cheese along with some pico de gallo.  Everything on the tacos was good and overall they were a solid breakfast choice but by the time I was finished I actually wished that I had chosen another of their options.    The bottom line for me is that I will head back to first watch again in the future.  I loved that they made their breakfast menu \"fun\" while also keeping it somewhat healthy.",

It's a coconut chia seed pudding topped with fresh fruit, granola and fruit preserves. It comes with a side of toast with almond butter. I seriously could eat that everyday.",

    "text": "A great addition to McCandless Crossing. A very large menu, so if you have a hard time making up your mind at a restaurant like I do, allow some extra time.  They seem to always have some kind of interesting special items. Really great bread. My husband always gets the skillet hash and loves that.  My favorite item is the Farm house tacos which are small soft tacos with eggs, chorizo, salsa and avacado. They usually come with chicken, but I usually get them without since I'm not a fan. Always great service. A little pricey, but worth it.",

Extremely friendly and she left the container of water and coffee pot on the table for refills. Lastly, she offered a coffee cup Togo after I paid.",
