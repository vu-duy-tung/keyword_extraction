Happy hour started.  And then, for whatever reason, they cranked the music to the point where our server couldn't even hear us order and we could no longer have a conversation at the table.  Kids loved their pizza.  I loved my gorgonzola burger.  The pizza was kind of meh but not awful.  Server was good too, but based on the noise alone, we would go for a happy hour without kids.",

The staff was pleasant and welcoming. A friend and I both decided to order the honey turkey wraps that were accompanied by seasoned potato chips. When the wraps arrived, they were prepared exactly as described on the menu and they looked great. The wraps were tasty, but rather dry and lacking the honey mustard dressing. We asked the server if we could have more dressing for our wraps. She happily provided us each with a very small plastic cup of dressing. When we received our bill, we were shocked that each of us had been charged an additional 50 cents for the additional dressing! If the wraps were prepared with an insufficient amount of dressing, it seems that a few more teaspoons of dressing could have been provided as a courtesy! The chips were fresh and crispy, but the iced tea tasted as though it was served from a fountain dispenser.",

    "text": "I've been interested in this place for a while. They serve sandwiches pizza and salad - bar food.  We went on Saturday night at around 630. The restaurant has a real neighborhood feel to it. We only had to wait a few minutes for a table. When we were seated, our waitress took our drink orders in before we could add anything ran away. We are going to order an appetizer then. Basically most of the evening, She was leaving us as fast as she could.  We started with house made potato chips. They were excellent with a side of fiery ranch dressing. There are not vegetarian sandwich options to speak of So the vegetarian turn to the pizza section and ordered one with olives onions and artichokes that's preset on the menu. Also ordered a salad which when it came tasted fine but at eight or 9 Bucks Was Way overpriced for the size. Turns out this is not a nine dollar for salad kind of place unless they're going to make it a big salad. The other guest ordered a hamburger with bacon and cheese. These are also called bacon cheeseburgers.  We got some onion rings which are plentiful but just completely battered. Some people like that -personally I prefer them breaded. if you like  them battered these were probably good.  The pizza was  overpriced. It would've been price fine if it were a particularly good pizza but despite the things on it it lacked flavor. It was supposed to have roasted garlic on it although I neither saw nor tasted any.   So the pizza was very disappointing to the point where I did not take any of it home. There are plenty of TVs to watch sports and if you're looking for bar food in a low-key atmosphere,certainly go to here if you're in the mood for something a little Better, skip it",

It is still ok, but not like it used to be.    Parking situation is a little tough and there always seems to be a wait with no where to wait but at the front door.  So it is popular right now. However, food is not as good as it used to be.    Pizza is slightly better than the pizza joint next door.  Wings seem to be breaded, and every time we have got them they are soggy.  The real shame is the sandwiches have gone down a few stars.  They used to be amazing from first bite to last.  Now I would rate them slightly above your standard.  We are really disappointed.  Also, I don't think they have breakfast anymore, but not completely sure.  On the plus side, you can get a beer there.",

They do offer some dine in seating, but we typically do carry out. They have 6 packs to go and usually around 20 beers on tap, which is an excellent amount for the size of the place. Most recently, my mom and I split the gourmet roast beef cheddar melt, which comes with carmelized onions, Vermont cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and horseradish mayo on Asiago ciabatta. This sandwich, along with all of the others I have tried, are substantial in size and perfect for sharing. The carmelized onions added a sweet touch and the horseradish mayo gave the sandwich a nice kick. I love Asiago bread so this was a winner for me. The bread/meat ratio was on point with equal amounts of both. Homemade chips come with the sandwich and they are stellar- crispy and well seasoned. I have also had the Rachael, the California chicken wrap, and the Gorgonzola roast beef melt, all of which I enjoyed. They also have wings, pizza, salads, and burgers. I'd definitely recommend checking them out. Oh, and happy hour is 4:30-6:30 Monday through Friday!",

Ruebens can get messy and soggy but how they treat the rye made it the best Rubeben/Rachel I've ever had. The sandwiches come with really good thick BBQ seasoned chips. Very good.

Our server was very knowledgeable about what beer would be best for both our meal and our preferences. After leaving, I kept thinking about how amazing everything was. It had been a long time since I've had such a great burger. When hanging out with friends last week, I was willing to drive 40 minutes out of my way to make another trip to Goodfellas. This week, with a birthday celebration on the to do list, I suggested yet again that we make another bit of a trek. I am definitely hooked and the short drive of 40 minutes seems totally worth it!

The wings are great as is the pizza. The beer selections are nice and change with the seasons. They don't mind when you ask for a taste before a full pour. It is small inside but they do keep things moving. Great place to sit at the bar and watch the game.",

They don't have a ton of seating but do have a decent size bar so we sat there.  The beer selection on tap was very good, and they also have a great cooler section of bottles.    The staff was friendly and chatty and provided excellent service.  I asked some of the regulars what to get there and was told \" I've never had a bad meal here.\"    I opted for the blackened chicken wrap and Megan got a Burger (onion, cheese, and balsamic).  Wow was the burger good!  The chicken was delicious as well, but the tortilla itself was nothing to write home about.  If I did the blackened chicken again I'd do a salad or sandwich for sure.    Fries were good and Home made chips have this heavenly seasoning on them!  I will try one of the more typical deli sandwiches next time (pastrami, Reuben, etc).  Great place for a cold beer and a quick bite!",

We couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there.   The mom's were completely oblivious (enjoying their drinks) that their boys were acting like they were at Chuckie Cheese.    At one point our waitress made a comment that \"they were in there all the time\".    That's when I was pretty sure I wasn't coming back.

Turkey Club is my go-to sandwich, and I have had them from coast to coast from a hundred different sandwich shops. In my opinion, the turkey club is the measure of a sandwich shop, and demonstrates their full capabilities: Three slices of bread, so it has to be perfect, and perfectly toasted for the center slice to withstand the onslaught of deliciousness Bacon, which must be perfectly crispy so that you don't take a bite and end up dragging a piece of bacon out with your teeth and subsequently screwing everything up Turkey, which must be thinly, AND FRESHLY shaved, for the perfect texture and flavor A rich, sharp cheddar, fresh, crisp lettuce, and fresh tomato with a soft red core - not some unripe, pumped-full-of-red-dye piece of garbage.  Goodfellas has produced one of the top three clubs I have ever had, and I don't say that lightly.  They have a full spread though - don't stop yourself at the club. They have multiple Italian varieties that will absolutely make your lunch perfect.",

Once we sat down our waiter immediately came to our table to get our drink order.  The beer selection is impressive and extensive. I had a White Lightning which was served just how I like it, ice cold.  I ordered the Cheddar Melt Roastbeef as did my son. My daughter ordered the Gorgonzola Roast beef sandwich and her husband ordered the Reuben.  The roast beef sandwiches were served on Asiago cheese ciabatta and had delicious horseradish mayo.  Ask for extra sauce on the side for dipping the delicious homemade spicy chips. I could just eat those for lunch and be happy they are so good.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and they have 6 TV's playing the days games.  I would definitely eat here again and recommend it to anyone who likes an ice cold beer with their sandwich while watching your favorite team.",

    "text": "I had my eye on \"Goodfellas Deli & Drafthouse\" after I noticed that this establishment had a rating of almost 5 perfect stars!!!!  Well yinz... did it live up to the hype!??  YOU BETCHA!!  Me and a dear friend of mine -coolest cat on the planet \"Joe\" arrived on a Thursday night around 6:30 - Pens game yet too.  The parking wasn't too bad in front and noticed there was a sign for more parking in the rear.  Walking in ..  was told there was a wait for a table -three people in front of us. Ok - no problem..so we headed to the bar.  Approaching the bar.. I noticed it was packed and usually takes a few minutes to get waited on.. but this wasn't the case since we were immediately waited on!   I need to point out that there was only 1 bartender working too... so impressive.   Usually, I am a politely aggressive at any bar when ordering a drink and typically there's a wait when ordering a drink but not this time. Being that there was no bar stools available we hung out at the side of the bar near the back wall... theres a little black ledge there to chill.. which is hard to see from the front angle but was a nice spot to wait until our table was ready.  So right after we finished our first beer.. a booth opened up (which was perfect!)  Our waitress appeared a few minutes later and we placed our drink and food order.  Our food came right away too!! It seemed like it was just five minutes and it came.. appetizer first and not a moment later the food..   Gorgonzola burger:  It tasted like a gourmet burger.. very delicious and different.  I was weary about the balsamic drizzle on it - but it was good.  Beer Battered Onion Rings:   Flavorful - Outta Sight ..  dipped in Heinz Ketchup. .. oh yea.   Wing Dust Wings (Crispy):    Were really good and so much meat on the wings.. loved that.   The wing orders are 12 only - not 6.  It would have been better if you were able to order 6 at a time because then you can sample more flavors:  Chipotle BBQ, Parm Herb Butter, and Sesame Asian.  I thought the wing flavors were different but 12 to an order - forced to decide on 1 flavor... I didnt like that being a wing lover. The restaurant itself was comfortable and very clean.   I have plenty of left overs for work the next day...The food and service was outstanding.  Goodfellas Deli & Drafthouse deserves 5 stars.   I will no doubt be back to visit.",

I did some searching and came across Goodfellas and based on the Yelp reviews decided this was a place that we needed to try. The menu offers excellent variety, which is exactly what we were all looking forward to after a morning of traveling. I went for the Blackened Chicken Wrap with the Fresh Cut Chips and a side of Ranch dressing. It was very, very good. The wrap was filling, but not overly so. The flavors of the chicken were awesome and then it had a good ratio of the cheese, lettuce and tomatoes inside the wrap. My mom went for the Blackened Chicken Quesadilla and I tried a bite and it was equally good. My dad went for the Gourmet Roast Beef sandwich and he was not disappointed - and it had a heaping amount of roast beef on it (Boar's Head!), which he was very happy with. They have a great beer selection and will offer you a taste of beers if you are undecided. It's a no frills environment with solid food options at great value. Our waitress was extremely attentive and pleasant. Parking is free in their lot.",

Seated within 30 seconds of walking through the door, beers served within 4 minutes, appetizer served so quickly that I was actually surprised, and entrees perfectly timed.  I ordered a burger medium-well, and it was done exactly medium-well -- this seems normal, but honestly doesn't happen all that often.  The Spicy Fella pizza was actually spicy! Again, this seems intuitive, but as fans of truly spicy food can attest, it's difficult to actually get truly spicy food. \"Spicy\" tends to mean \"not mild\", which is nowhere near the same thing.  The beer selection on draft was excellent and varied, and the bottled selection was terrific. I now follow their draft and bottled beer updates on the Untapped app, and the attention to new offerings is refreshing and the selections carefully curated.  We will be back!",

The French fries were not hot and quite soggy. The girl who rung me out was not really personable And pretty much just rushed through my transaction as though I interrupted what she was doing.",

    "text": "Solid!!! We were greeted immediately upon entering and taken to an empty booth. Small place and I could see how they could get really busy. Our waiter immediately came over and got our waters leaving us time the peruse the menu, both food and beer. We decided to get wings and both got a sandwich as well. The menu isn't huge, sandwiches and burgers and a few pizzas but what we had was fantastic. The hubby noted that the deli mustard was entirely TOO hot which is why they don't get the other star. Our waiter had a great knowledge of the beers on the menu, which was incredibly helpful! Our wings arrived first as requested. We chose the Asian sesame. They were phenomenal. Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy,  and cooked on the inside. And the flavor, Soy with sesame and just a nice underlying heat. Scrumptious! I got the Deli Lama with sweet potato fries. The fries cooked perfectly. My sandwich corned beef and pastrami on rye with Cole slaw, Swiss, and thousand island dressing. The meat was so tender and just solidly good. The bread, fresh and yummy! The hubby got the wise guy minus the coleslaw. It is pastrami brisket, Swiss, deli mustard, on rye. He said the deli mustard was too hot but he liked the bread and thought the brisket was solid. We had cheesecake for dessert and it was rich and delicious! Overall solid and we will certainly go back, especially for the wings!",

Sunday was sorta dull minus seeing Jordan Speith chip in that playoff bunker shot....only two people yelled.  Now, the reuben sandwich I had was quite nice.  Well toasted, and that's unusual, because most toasted sandwiches are just barely hit with some heat.  Side order of chips were not good.....just not good at all.  Sandwich was good....beer was good (local red ale).  I wish there was a 3 1/2 stars.....that's what they really deserve.  Doubt I'll ever be back because I was travelling, but do check them out if you're nearby.",

Not a bad place but I'd consider eating somewhere else, but great spot for a few beers with buddies! Place is kind of small. A little pricy also 2 Miller lites and onion rings with BBQ sauce $15 and change $20 all in with tip.",

Their happy hour is from 4:30-6:30 - they have an amazing draft list. The wait staff is always so friendly and accommodating.   For starters, we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. The waitress offered to give us the opportunity to add on more pita chips- you're gonna need it, because it is delicious and you will want to eat every last bite.   We also ordered the wings, which my parents loved. I'm not the biggest fan of wings, but I tried one and would definitely get them next time.   For my entree, I ordered the Margherita pizza. It's perfect for sharing with your family or friends.... or saving some for lunch the next day.   I'll definitely be back to Goodfellas again soon.",

    "text": "Me and my coworkers decided to try out Goodfellas yesterday for lunch. We were seated quickly even though the place looked packed.  They have a great selection of beer and wine, even though we weren't drinking.  We checked out other yelpers' pictures to help us decide what to eat. Two of my coworkers opted for the Goodfella. Both seemed to enjoy it. Kaysi and I were hung up on which burgers to try, so we decided to each pick one and we swapped a half with each other so we could both try more than one burger.   He got the Turkey Avacodo burger with chips. This burger was juicy and delicious.  The flavor was out of this world! He said the chips were delicious as well.   I ordered the Gorgonzola burger, medium well, with a side salad, no onions and their house Italian dressing. The first thing that turned me off was the salad came on the warm plate with the burger. There were onions on my salad, and she forgot what dressing I wanted. The burger was over done and dry, which was a disappointment because the other flavors were on point! The cook had to be able to tell there was zero pink in the middle when he cut it in half, like we asked. The onion ring on the burger was crunchy, the amount of Gorgonzola was perfect and so was the seasoning. If it would have been as juicy and delicious as the turkey burger, I wouldn't be able to tell you which one was better.  The server didn't really seem to care, which is why I only gave it three stars. Customer service is just as important as the food quality in my opinion. Even though my food was overdone, which I project was an accident due to them being so busy, it was still better than her stale personality.    I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Even though my job is 5 minutes from here.",

The bacon was super thick and cooked very well. The downfall to mine was the fries. They were pretty soggy, like they were sitting under a heat lamp for ages. One other ding is that you can't order a half order of wings (they come by the dozen). We would've happily ordered 6 wings, but couldn't eat a dozen on top of our other food so we didn't get to order any. I will also say that this place was immaculate, including the restrooms. You can't say that about many places anymore.",

Either way, skip the breading... trust your wing!  :-)  I ordered the Spicy Fella pizza.  I kept calling it the Spicy Benny after a pizza I get regularly when in Charleston SC (D'Allesandro's).

While the wrap was good, it was nothing extravagant; just a wrap. The chips, however, we're fantastic! They were fresh and covered with tons of seasoning.   The restaurant had several televisions, however, the layout of the tables make it challenging for all guests to watch them. Employees were engaging and quick to serve and provide the check. For the price, the food was just ok.   For a quick bite to eat or to sit and enjoy a game, give Goodfellas a try!",

Since I'm vegetarian. It was ok. It could have been much better. Since I didn't want the steak or chicken I asked for extra veggies. But there were more French fries than actual lettuce.  And the lettuce was mainly iceberg.  Over all good service and atmosphere.  .   I visited again last night. I was disappointed with the service. I asked for a cheeseburger with no tomato and extra pickles.  When it came there were 2 huge slides of tomatoes and only 1 pickle. Again I asked for extra pickles and also some mayo. I got neither one. The server came back but she didn't mention what I had already asked for and when I took the 2huge tomatoes off in front of her. I put them in a napkin. She never said a word about her mistake. I guess she just want listening to anything I said.  There was no excuse of being busy. There were only 3 tables being served. I think she just chose to ignore my request. Very disappointed .  My friend had the Pitt salad  again hardly any real vegetables just mainly iceberg lettuce.",

    "text": "You gotta automatically love and expect great things when the menu board outside the front door boasts \"Soup of the day: BEER!\" Inside a comfortable clean restaurant and neighborhood bar with 5 TVs for watching a game. The draft beer menu was nice, and also several coolers of bottles and cans made for a great selection. I had the Rueben on grilled marble rye, piled high with corned beef and kraut. I had to open my mouth wide! So good! My wife went for the buffalo chicken wings, which I was glad I didn't order because they were (lightly) breaded and also jumbo. These were good for her but not to my taste. I like wings from scrawny chickens, and then just flats, no drums. And smothered in hot garlic sauce. But I digress. She loved them and that's all that mattered. To each his or her own. Bottom line, lots of beer, delicious food, generous portions, reasonable prices. What's not to like? I'll be back!",
