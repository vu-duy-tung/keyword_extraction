    "text": "You can't beat the view but that's about the only thing you can't beat here.  We had reservations for an early dinner (5:30) since we were seeing a show that evening.  We were seated right beside a service area where they have their scheduling computer.  It was clear that there was much confusion with who was taking care of which tables in their 3-story facility.  It was very distracting and annoying as the manager, dressed in dirty cargo pants, and the servers were trying to figure out what they were doing, grouped literally 2-feet from our table, and as the manager and our server repeatedly coughed...apparently they were both ill.    Here is a list of other transgressions.  The manager had to summons our server to take our order after almost an 1/2 hour even though there were very few people in the restaurant...our server appeared to be, uhmmmm, not of clear mind as we could barely understand what he was saying as well as some strange behavior...my filet special was WAY over cooked but that was because they gave me someone else's steak, which the manager admitted and was going to take care of but never did.  The server did however take our wine off the bill for the \"long wait.\"...the server brought my wife's left-overs and informed us that he had dropped it on the floor but only lost three of the gnocchi before repackaging it and somehow expecting that this way o.k.!     I will say, the food, my overdone steak notwithstanding, was very good and the wine selection was not bad, which is the only reason I gave a 2-star rating instead of 1-star.  But for a restaurant with an asset like the view from Mt. Washington to be that unprofessional was astounding.  It really is a shame.  Will not return.",

Definitely worth the trip up the incline -even with that burly lady in charge of incline ticketing- Come for the view, return for the food! Friendly service, maybe on the slow side that day but they make up for it with their conversation. Party of five so we covered quite a bit of dishes and everybody returns to France with good memories of Pittsburgh dining. That was the point. Keep at it folks!",

We were a party of 8 and had prime rib, filet, salmon, crabcakes and lobster mac and cheese(with a full lobster on top!) Our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our many questions about the menu choices, wine and beer recommendations. Everyone loved their food and the overall experience.  When another waiter saw me taking a picture, he offered to take it and got the whole amazing skyline.  I would recommend this for any special event or dinner out.  The prices were reasonable for a fine dining establishment.  We would definitely go again.",

    "text": ".  No valet parking, though the host greets you outside the restaurant, making you think he's in charge of the valet parking and is the first indication of just how small the restaurant space really is. We sat by the window, great view but don't come for the view, come for the service & food. Our waitress (Jennifer) was very friendly and attentive and went over all the house specials and answered all our questions. An odd point, after April 1st, they don't offer soup on the menu.  My wife had the house salad, excellent and the house dressing was outstanding. I had the chopped salad. A little different, the lettuce was not chopped, the chopped ingredients rested on a bed of spring mix lettuce, but very tasty. We had to wait for the fresh bread to come out of the oven, it was nothing special. I ordered the Osso Busso. I had read reviews on Yelp, all positive, all True. I've heard of other variations, veal, over polenta, for example. This was pork over mashed potatoes w/green beans. I have never had it before so I don't have anything to compare it to, but the pork was tender, and very flavorful. Yum! My wife often orders the crab cakes when she is out. She did again. She received two good sized cakes w/asparagus. Her revue is simple. They were the best she has ever had, period. She could only finish one of the two. We shared the death by chocolate dessert. If you have to die, this is the way to go! At the end of it all, only two comments: we most definitely will return and would order the same meals again but based upon the experience we are anxious to try other things on the menu.",

It was lunch time and we were hoping to eat lunch on Mt Washington as a family before heading back. Other restaurants would not serve us with our young children.   When I came to Vue 412, I asked the manager if they would serve us and he said \"they would be honored\". This won me over. But the great hospitality continued throughout our entire experience. The manager came by multiple times to express his gratitude for our having lunch with them and asked how everything was.   The food was good. I felt it was a bit pricey for what I got, but the friendliness of the entire staff made up for this in my mind.",

We were at our table for 15 minutes before he told us the specials. Another group was at the bar and there was a kid sitting on the floor. We said sorry and walked out. I recommend Shiloh Bar down the road, the food was delicious.",

The shrimp was great and the mussels were fine (although the sausage I found to be on the dry side). The lobster mac n cheese came in a huge portion with a fair amount of lobster. However, after 10 bites, I no longer felt the desire to continue eating. It's one of those dishes where it's good for the first few bites, but then gets tiring to eat. The Osso Bucco Chardonnay (\"French inspired pork shank braised in rosemary demi\") was well prepared and we would recommend it. Our server was very kind and attentive. The view at Vue 412 is great, but just as good as any other restaurant on Grandview Ave. The seats by the window seemed limited though, at least on the top floor. Since boyfriend and I came on a weeknight (Thursday), the top level was all empty except for the two of us by around 9:15pm, which made it extra romantic!

The banquet menus and pricing were easily accessible online which gave me all the information I was looking for. I called the restaurant and was easily able to reserve a room for my party and also pick the menu. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the manager and a welcoming staff. The staff was attentive and very personable. Aside from the fantastic service, the food was unbelievable and a great value for the price. At the end of the party, our waiter, Pat, after already doing a great job, packaged up all of our leftover food to take home. Will definitely be recommending Vue 412 to others as well as will be returning back myself. They were able to make what could have been a very stressful experience, relaxing and memorable. Definitely stop in!",

The food was great aside from the salads which were inconsistent and the dressing was oily. The servers were good but the table set ups were sporadic and they were running around like crazy. The bar was swamped but the drinks were consistently great. They only things stopping that fifth star was the lack of food and overwhelmed servers. I will be back to this great new restaurant.",

Even though we couldn't get seats upon calling ahead, we took a ride up the incline and while walking around the new owner invited us to the bar.  Great updates! Great new menu and libation offerings!  Extremely friendly and hospitable!  So Happy to have experienced it and will be back the next time we are in the Burg!  You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Overall I really enjoyed Vue 412. The view is obviously great but we also enjoyed the food and the cocktails. I like that there are options for a less expensive casual meal or for an expensive night out. I also love that they put a recommended drink pairing next to the menu items.   We started the meal off with a crab and corn dip that I thought was delicious. For my meal I ordered the chicken tacos which I enjoyed. I also tasted the chicken flatbread which was awesome and the garlic fettuccini that was very rich but delicious.   The only downside with the food was I ordered the mixed green salad as an appetizer and it just came out a bed of spinach and didn't have the toppings described in the menu. The others ordered wedge salad which they said was great.  Another issue was we ordered dessert to go (death by chocolate, coconut cream pie, and cheesecake). The cheesecake was very good but the others must have been incorrect because the coconut cream pie was a cake and had no coconut and the death by chocolate was also a vanilla cake) Not sure if the waiter possibly put it in wrong but we didn't realize until we got home.   I went in the first couple weeks of the opening so I will definitely try it again.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this restaurant only has 3 1/2 stars, and I am a foodie. We went back and forth about whether to even give it a shot, because of the overall rating, but it was excellent. This is our first time visiting Pittsburgh, and we decided to ride the Duquesne Incline to see the skyline and the rivers from above.  Once we stood in line at the bottom, rode up, and did some observing we didn't feel ready to turn around and go back down, so we checked yelp, and other restaurants seemed to either be three dollar signs or poorly rated (or both), so we decided to give two dollar signs and average reviews a shot. The views from this restaurant are incredible. The salad and entree portions were small (you probably won't have leftovers), but plenty filling and very delicious. The desserts are huge, and the tiramisu stood out as especially good. I think I've only had better tiramisu twice before, and one of those times was in Venice. Our waitress was really kind and funny, and very sweet with our daughter. It was pricey (pricier than we ever go out for), but I have to imagine that the real estate up there is very expensive! It was definitely worth the price for a special occasion, and the food and view made it an experience, not just a meal.",

    "text": "I've been here twice--the first time I went was a great experience.  We had amazing seats for dinner right against the window during the sunset.  The view was amazing, and the wine and food (salmon) was excellent.    Fast forward to a month later, and based on my first experience, I suggested Vue 412 for my dad's birthday, since my family wanted to go somewhere a little more upscale.  They did a great job accommodating a party of 12, with a few younger children, and the view was again great.  However, that's where the positives stopped.  When we sat down, the menu was not what I remembered.  The first time I went, the menu was a one pager with 10 or so entree options.  This time, the menu was totally different--it was a dozen pages.  I was just disappointed that it seemed like the restaurant went from being more on the upscale side to a much more casual concept.  I got the filet and it was below average.  A few family members said their food was very much over salted.  However, we still paid for the meals as if the place was more upscale.  I guess as an earlier reviewer stated, you are simply paying for the view.  I also thought the service was a big downgrade the second time around.  We had two servers, based on the party of 12, and they had to come back 3 separate times to ask myself and other members of my family what we ordered or how we wanted our steaks done.  I understand if that happens with one person, but I'm not sure how they totally missed 3 out of 12 orders.    Long story short, raved about this place after my first visit, but probably won't be going back now that I know it is not the same formal concept I remember it being--plenty of other options in Mt. Washington with a view.",

The arancini and barrata appetizers were spot on: the risotto was cooked perfectly and had a savory crunchy shell, and the barrata cheese was served with hazelnuts roasted to perfection and honey which was a great combination. For dinner, I had the branzino, which I cannot recommend highly enough. The skin was crispy, the meat cooked perfectly, all served over a delectable ratatouille of tomatoes, carrots and zucchini. Everyone else in my party loved their dishes but was jealous of mine haha. I also enjoyed two of their Rye and Boulevard, and Manhattan-like cocktail that was right up my alley. Of course, the view was amazing, even during the daytime. Our server was attentive and helpful and our dishes arrived promptly. I'll also add that, when I left my debit card in a check book, the manager went above and beyond to help me locate it. By the time I was able to stop back, I saw the view at night, which was even more incredible. I would definitely recommend Vue 412 for anyone who's not necessarily looking for a Le Mont level experience, but after amazing good at a fair price point.",

We then proceeded to attempt to order a bottle of wine, however, every single bottle we wanted they were \"out\" of until the 4th try. We actually thought they were kidding.  Moving on to the food... Our salads came out after our meals, which was 30 minutes after ordering them. The lemon basil vinaigrette was nothing short of being ranch dressing and for $9, the portion was really small. It was white and creamy. Nothing lemon, basil, or vinaigrette about it. None of my party wanted our salads after our meals. The manager did remove the salads from our checks, which was the right thing to do, but I sent mine back all together. My gnocchi with Italian sausage arrived to the table cold, however, the remainder of my partied food was warm. Once reheated, it was pretty good but again, a really small portion  One of my friends has a gluten allergy, so she asked for a side of fries with her meal (fries are on the menu). Her food arrived 5 minutes after everyone else's and was missing the fries. When she asked the cook, who delivered her meal without the fries, he asked like he was doing her SUCH a huge favor by throwing some fries in the fryer since they don't typically serve them. I didn't understand since again, fries are on the menu.  To top the night off, when I went to use the restroom, the stall was out of toilet paper and the trash can overflowing. That was the icing to the cake.  The view at Vue 412 is unbeatable, but you can get the same view with a better meal and service at Monterrey Bay or one of the other better restaurants on Mt Washington. The inside of the restaurant is very out dated and the outside looks like a night club.  Trying to make up for the horrible experience we had, the manager gave us 3 free desserts to try, which I did really appreciate. The lemon cello cake was delicious and the only reason I am giving this review a 2 star. I am glad I tried Vue 412, however, I don't think I'll return.",

However, the staff was quick to find us a table, and then even gave us a table that was sort of in its own room with a great view of the city. The staff and owner checked on us to make sure we were doing all right and offered to take a photo of us with downtown Pittsburgh in the background. When the food came out there was one dish that was cold, but our waitress took it back and later brought up an hot version that was clearly just made, which was appreciated. Other than that initial issue everyone in our family was happy with their meal.",

    "text": "Very expensive for so-so quality food and light wine pours.  Started with the spiced cauliflower appetizer. It was good. Ordered surf and turf as the entree. The steak was done perfectly but would have been better with more seasoning. The lobster was a bit rubbery, possibly slightly under done. The cream brulee was not good at all. Oddly our waitresses wine pours were quite skimpy, but a male waiter consistently served his tables generous pours. I'm guessing that the server pours their own wine vs a bartender since hers were always too light and his were always full. At $15 each they should not be light. One appetizer, two entrees, one desert, and four drinks were over $200. That's a little high for what this turned out to be. Not bad but much better choices are available in Pittsburgh at this price point.",

They had TVs on so we could watch the World Cup and the service behind the bar was fantastic. The owner gave us lots of backstory to some of the buildings that we could see from the view as we mentioned we are Canadian and don't know much history of the city. Just a fantastic little spot and we regret not having lunch because the food looked amazing.",

(One example: We were a bit fussy about what table we preferred and they very nicely cleaned off a recently used one that we liked a bit better than the one we were led to.)  The menu is reasonable, the food is good and the prices are reasonable too.  The waiter could use a bit more experience with the drink menu and stock but he more than made up for that with his attentiveness and terrific service.  It really seemed like they (waiter and manager and others) were all trying hard to make it an enjoyable experience and they succeeded!   Will go back soon!",

The view of course was magnificent. Dana's drinks were perfect. I had a dirty martini which they had their own recipe including blue cheese stuffed olives. It definitely was the best I ever had. My wife had the blood orange Bellini which she said was delicious. Joe the owner , came over and gave us a history of the area . He is a very personable and we enjoyed talking with him. He made us feel very welcome. It felt like he was an old friend or even family member. We didn't eat but my wife did order the chocolate cake which was rich and decadent.  We will be back to Pittsburgh regularly since my son bought a house there and we are looking forward to having dinner at Vue 412.",

The spaghetti and meatballs were awful, the pasta was overcooked, the sauce was very bland, and the meatballs were heavy and rock like.   The service was very quick and our waiter was patient and personable. The view of the city was nice but the windows were dirty which made taking a decent picture impossible. The music was at just the right level for conversation but the dining room did get quite noisy as it filled in.  I would probably go back to try lunch or dessert but would not have dinner again.",

I wouldn't expect that at Eat'n'Park, much less a place that serves up $35 entrees. My medium rare steak had absolutely no pink in it. Then our soups we ordered to start our meals came out about 10 minutes after we were both well into our plates. Very disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber. No heads up that the soup was still being prepared, just dropped off well into our staggered meal. Had any of that been mentioned beforehand it would've been an afterthought, but we had assumed the server just forgot to put them in until we got them towards the end of our meal.  My meal still tasted great, as did hers, but mine wasn't cooked as I had requested and the service was just disorganized. It's a new place with a presumably new staff so I'm sure there's going to be growing pains. I'll go back, but my experience would've been incredibly disappointing if not for the quality of the meal. Here's hoping they work the kinks out.",

The restaurant week menu was varied with choice.  I had the salad with frisee, pears, goat cheese and walnuts.  Amazing.  Then the mahi mahi with porcini tortellini and asparagus.  The portions were Perfect and the entree was wonderful!   Dessert was the chocolate torte- delicious.  Our waiter, Nathan, was fun, professional and extremely accommodating- even great with the kids.   The ambience is nice but nothing over the top.  The only (semi) con, was the slow service.  We sat down at 7 and didn't receive our entrees until 8:05.  They did provide wonderful bread with a scrumptious dipping oil.  I do have to add that although the service was slow, they were quick with the kids meals, and which is always a good thing.   Summary... great views, nice ambience, great waiter, and delicious food!   Just expect to wait a while for your main entree.  Unless you're under 10 years old :).  Will definitely be returning.",

Jackie was our server, and she was the best waitress I have ever had. Other people also stopped by our table throughout the night to ask about how we liked the food. It was their second night with their new chef. I'll give him 5 stars!! We were served complimentary \"palate kickstarters\" that were great, as well as a complementary warm bread with an olive and raspberry compote. Delicious. All dishes were served in a very well planned out and spaced out time period. We had time to eat and enjoy each dish as well as visit, but were never waiting on the next dish you come. We left satisfied but not stuffed, and still talking about how in the world they could have created those flavors!",

My husband asked for an ice water that never came until he asked someone else.  There were dirty glasses everywhere and everything seemed like a cluster... Nobody knew what they were doing.  The mirror behind the bar should be removed because in its reflection you can see all of the crap and dirty rags and random stuff piled underneath the bar.  To top it off the waitstaff seemed to be standing around complaining about this, that, and the other thing.  2 stars for the view and the drinks, but the professionalism and cleanliness could be improved.",

The staff was very nice, friendly and made you feel very welcome being there.  Their house dressing is amazingly good... Lemon basil! Didn't know if I would like it and loved it! If you go there try it, it could be your new favorite dressing.  Now for our dinner orders: my friend ordered Chicken Picatta, the aroma was wonderful however when cutting into the chicken it was still raw inside. I ordered their Chicken Romano when I tasted it there was no flavor and the creme sauce just like a thickened milk. After adding more salt than I would ever use, pepper the manager came by and asked how things were. I asked for parmesan cheese and explained that there no flavor and trying to fix it. He did offer to make something else which I said no. He took back the under cooked chicken and brought it back chopped up when it was done. After adding the fresh grated parmesan to the chicken Romano it made it better, but eating it there were stems of the thyme left on the chicken so if you didn't catch it you were spitting out small (1\") pieces of stems! The chef should of used the knife to strip the stem or used a spice stripper or made sure the stems didn't make it to the table. Nothing like being at a nice restaurant having to spit out things! ugh...  Also the pasta was over cooked or had been sitting to long in hot water.   The manager did offer to adjust the bill, make something new, which I said no but they could of offered a dessert for the mishaps or 10% off the bill, or the waitress could of said I'm sorry but we hope you come back and try again, or here is a card for something off your next visit. We were very nice about it all were others would be making a lot of  noise over it.  They also need to think about updating a little to cover up the ruff wood paneling on the walls that is painted off white. A little investment would make a big difference...   Try it maybe your experience will be better than ours... two salads, and two chicken meals, 1 ice tea, $65....",

As I was eating I knew it wasn't.  The manager came over and said he would check , never came back!  No apology.  We received our check with the appetizers on it.

My friends were just too to polite to cause a scene and we were there trying to celebrate a birthday, not spend the whole time complaining. Food took FOREVER and was terrible. Must be all that fine dining I dont know about? Oh wait, I've worked in fine service for ten years. Our water and drinks were empty all night. Ambience was non-existent.

He also offered meal suggestions and was extremely helpful in answering questions about the menu. Our meals came out quickly and they were absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend the lobster mac 'n cheese! We also ordered chocolate cake for dessert but it turned out that they were all out. However, Rob came out with cotton candy in a large class with two lit sparklers for us to celebrate. It was such a fun surprise. STILL, the manager decided to get a new cake out of the refrigerator downstairs for us to enjoy. Obviously, we had a great experience at Vue 412. If you go, ask for Rob!

    "text": "This was hard to grade because elements were exceptional and elements were just OK.  First, the positive:  - The view, that's why you're here and it doesn't let you down. Spectacular view where you find yourself staring out the window at nothing in particular; it's just stunning!  - The service was near the best of any experience I've had, anywhere. From the time we arrived, through the initial bar service, to the manager and chef checking in; it was a welcoming experience without being overly bearing. Some higher end services like an initial sample from the chef and a soup sampling for me while my dining guest was having a salad and I had nothing...those were subtle but welcome additions to the experience.  The cons:  - The food was generally inconsistent. Our flatbread appetizer was fantastic, the home made pizza dough was very good and the flavor of the pizza was very good. On the other hand, we had a risotto appetizer that was fried and served in marinara that wasn't horrible, it just felt and tasted like something you would get at a good bar or chain restaurant...not fine dining. The inconsistency continued for the main course. My two sides were excellent but then the sear on my scallops, that had been done perfectly, had lost it's crunch by the time the dish reached the table and they were served on a bed of spinach that generally lacked flavor.  - Let's face it, you're here for the view. Aside from that, the aesthetics of the restaurant were somewhat dated. The downstairs bar is very pretty but other elements, like lighting fixtures and butcher paper on the white linen table clothes, didn't seem to fit.  - Generally, the menu lacked creativity. Main courses were served with traditional sides prepared in a traditional way. For a fine dining experience, I'm hoping to feel the chef's personality coming through the dishes.  Ultimately, I would love to give the place another try. The food was good enough that I'd like to try other dishes. With a bit of polishing, this could be a top-tier experience. In the mean time, it's an above average food experience, with exceptional service and a world class view.",

There are only a handful of restaurants to choose from and it was Labor Day so many were closed. Vue 412 was among those open. We moseyed on in and were seated after waiting about ten minutes.   First things first: The view is unbeatable. We were seated near a window downstairs and it certainly kept us busy while we waited for our food to come.  Where the experience missed the mark was the food (and occasionally the service). Not only did it take really long for our food to come out without an explanation, what did come out was rather underwhelming. I ordered the bistro club and it was nothing to write home about, and I can't say the flatbread or pastas really wowed anyone at my table. The manager came around the table and was super friendly; however, our server was a little spacey and not very knowledgeable when we tried to redeem our check-in offer for a discount on the bill. She took my phone away without asking for about five minutes trying to figure out what to do with it. In the end, they honored it which was much appreciated.   Maybe it was an off day, but in the future, I would try elsewhere.",

Food was great but took an extended period of time. View was beautiful aside from the forehead grease marks/fingerprints that were everywhere. Might go back for drinks and view only before an evening out. Need to start taking pictures so it doesn't seem I'm picking at any service. These are just things I'm not sure places think customers pay attn to and are easily corrected. Had sangria and it was delish!!",

When we walked in the made us wait for over ten minutes. We tried to take it casually, but we became infuriated the more we watched others around us being served. Finally, the server came over and when we asked could we eat in segments to give is time to think over each course he told us no. Later we observed the two other tables near us being served in that manner.  Additionally, I witnessed the black assistance staff not being treated fairly. The black server assistant was at the door with several plates, and two serves stood by the door and never even flinched to open the door. The manager tried to tell me that they usually do not have poor manners between staff. Total bullshit I can say to you from the demeanor of the team it is always like this.   The food was good, but I was so upset and disgusted that I barely ate after a while. I will never patronize this restaurant again.",

SALADS: 1) Butter poached lobster ($22): -1 Butter lettuce looks like something I could buy from Safeway (which is probably the case) +1 Lobster looks dank though! Pretty decent portion size.   ENTREES: 1) SCALLOPS ($28): +1 Oh danggg. Delicious, big chunks. One of the more pricier dishes, but a good blend of flavors.  2) SALMON ($24): +1 Generous slice! They took a while to make this one because the first piece was too small. How considerate of them!  3) SHORT RIB ($25): +1 Short rib is soft and definitely slow cooked for a while.  -1 However, the sauce didn't play well..also, usually the short rib is supposed to soak up flavors. This was hella dry/bland.   Overall, the service was not bad. Super friendly, and definitely feels like someone's home that was just renovated (the bathroom feels like my grandma's).

First off, the service was excellent. It wasn't crowded yet so we got window seating with perfect view of the city. Liz our server was super friendly and helpful about the sights and museums in the area. The manager came by several times to check us and made conversation. I was very impressed and can't even recall the last time we received such attentive service. Bonus points for sure! For appetizers we ordered the meatballs w/ricotta and the mussels PEI. Both delicious...I forgot to take the pics until we already started digging in! I ordered the osso buco which is always a must when i see it on the menu. Not many Italian restaurants serve this dish so I feel if it's on the menu, then its worth ordering! I  must say that this was the best osso buco I've had...maybe ever! It never tastes exactly the same but this one was super tender yet there was a slight outer crisp that was seasoned to perfection! My hubby got the special which was the braised short ribs. It was also delicious. The mashed potato sides. Brussel sprouts, squash medley was all tasty and cooked nicely! We were so full but wanted to try their dessert so we ordered it to go...death by chocolate and the limoncello cake! We plan on visiting Pittsburgh again this summer with our other boys and this place is definitely on our list!",

The food came out very slowly, often  brought out by confused kitchen staff. One of our party had plastic in her salad for which the staff laughed at. My plate was dirty. Our party often had to wait long periods of time for all the dishes to arrive. At the end of the meal a piece of wall art ( some giant spoon direct from a suburban house in the 1990s ) fell off the wall and almost hit my girlfriend in the head. Again, nothing but a gigle from the wait staff. To top it all off the waitress refused to split any of the checks ( fair enough) but felt the need to add 18% gratuity. Given the size of the party on the surface this makes sense but the level of service we received was not worth the 18%.  The food is average. The atmosphere is dated. The service is awful. The view is good, so I guess there is that.",

The Hostess never communicated with us.  After some drinks at the bar,  we finally left hungry and upset.  It ruined a perfect day.  My child committed to Pitt and we were celebrating. View was wonderful ,  but not worth to headaches.  To make matters worse,  they didn't acknowledge my reservation with Open Table so we didn't get our 100 points!",

    "text": "My husband and I came for dinner. My food was delicious and steaming hot when it arrived so I personally would have rated it 5 stars. The only thing I noticed that was incorrect regarding my food was that the crab cake appetizer stated it came with a \"spicy\" remoulade. It was in no way spicy but being that I am not someone who loves spicy food I was fine with it. My husband on the other hand would have rated it a 2. His meatball appetizer came out cold. When they brought it out the second time it was lukewarm. Then minutes later our dinner came which was unfortunate for him because now he has 2 things to eat that have 2 different sauces so eating them together was not great on the taste buds. Again, my dinner was steaming. He got the gnocchi and Italian sausage and it was again, just warm. Also, it was supposed to be served with a vodka tomato cream sauce and it was not creamy at all. It looked real thin and greasy. They got real busy after we got there so he decided to just suck it up and eat what he could then have to wait for his entree to be corrected. When we left he said he wouldn't want to come back. Being that I enjoyed my food, I was thinking who I would bring back with me! The view was gorgeous. No complaints there!",

We had to flag down another server  (after 10 minutes) to get this correced.  The busses were hanging out in the restaurant and seemed to just be waiting.   The appetizer took too long and was extremely small for the price..plus the dressing was simply mayonnaise from a jar.  We each ordered a salad with grilled chicken and that took a very  long time.  The Salad was OK, but really mediocre. When we left, we observed kitchen staff seated at a table next to the front door on  smoke break. Not acceptable. This place needs to improve.",

We were greeted by the hostess who asked if we had a reservation and we replied no. She then quickly said well we don't have any seats by the window, however we could clearly see a two person table directly next to the window. We told her that was fine, we would take anything (we were starving after driving 5 hours). She told us to wait while she checked and came back to tell us the kitchen closed and we could not be seated. Immediately after she greeted the woman behind us who said I have a 9:30 reservation and was promptly seated. How could that be if the kitchen was closed? As someone who was a waitress for years I know best practice is to seat your customer and the kitchen does not close 40 minutes early! Awful. Will never return.",

    "text": "Six of us decided to try Vue 412 for Restaurant week based on the published fixed course menu.  We had a 7:45 reservation which likely factored into our frustrating experience whereby (1) the 3 of us who had order the Sea Bass were told 30 minutes after ordering that they had run out; (2) one person ordering a Pinot Noir with dinner was told they had run out; and (3) the 4 of us who had ordered Creme Brulee from the dessert options were told... yep, they had run out.  I can understand a restaurant running out of certain entrees, but why would the server not be informed in a timely manner.  Same for the desserts.  And how does a restaurant run out of a wine that's served by the glass?  The food, when we did get it, was tasty enough.  And the server was very apologetic for the problems.  Still, it was very frustrating as we had come to the restaurant based on their published menu and most of us had to compromise on what we ordered. That, plus the long wait times, made for a less than satisfying experience.  The manager came over late in the ordeal and apologized for our 'inconvenience' and offered a 10% discount.  However, his apology fell flat and the discount seemed like a token amount given their failure to deliver on food and service.",

I had the grilled radicchio salad with chicken and the spicy buffalo chili, and my husband had the club sandwich. The chili was tasty either the right amount of kick and enjoyed it quite a bit. However, it wasn't good enough to make up for the salad or the club sandwich unfortunately. My salad was supposed to come with roasted Brussels sprouts but they were uncooked and cold as ice. The lettuce and grilled radicchio were drenched in dressing and also cold making pretty inedible. They did bring me another side of sprouts after I asked them about it and they were nice and roasted the way they were supposed to be! The rest of the salad was not good and the chicken breast was over cooked and very dry. My husband's sandwich had a price of plastic wrapping from the chicken (?) but we didn't get an explanation about that. The server said it came with a whole chicken breast but it was just turkey deli slices. She was not very knowledgeable about the dishes or menu at all. I really wanted to like this place b/c I like to support small local places but I won't be going back to this one.",

We held the party in a private room upstairs which has an enclosed deck with a beautiful view and more than enough space for the 16 of us in the main room.  (The space would accommodate more if people were dining on the deck and plus there was another small room up there that we didn't use). The room had everything we needed including its own kitchenette/bar area, a flat screen TV, a pulldown screen to project our slideshow, and restrooms right outside the door.   There are three levels of pre-order buffet categories for large groups, each with many options from which to select entrees and sides. Having this pre-ordered fixed menu was so convenient and helped me predict the price as well. We could bring our own wine or order from their bar. They provided a custom birthday cake. All the food was delicious!   And the service was fantastic! The event coordinator, Jackie, is super sweet and helpful; the restaurant manager, Joe, was very nice and came up to meet me as I was decorating and then again to say a few words of welcome to our group; Nate was very helpful in helping me get the room set up between trying to take care of his lunch crowd; our waitresses, Sabrina and Dana, were awesome -- very nice, professional, and gave us great service.  I highly recommend Vue 412 for special occasions such as ours! It couldn't have gone better!",

The server was very moody and the food was also subpar... My group of five ordered multiple dishes, three of them being filet mignon. Two of the filets where actual filets, the other was what seemed to be an ironed steak-- the first order, which was supposed to be medium, was way overcooked, almost burnt. The second try was the same ironed steak, but medium. When we asked why this steak, along with the first try was a different cut than the other two, we had both the server AND manager argue with us. Extremely poor managerial experience... From the great reviews I have seen online I totally expected more from this restaurant.

Fingers crossed that it wasn't made with eggs, we went in and sat in the bar area which had a fantastic view! The bartender was very friendly and chatty. He took our drink order. Confirmed that the veggie burger was indeed vegan (yay!) and so we each ordered one. Sadly we were later told that they didn't have any made. Ok, no worries, we'll just drink our drinks.  Then to our great surprise out comes one veggie burger! Apparently they had enough ingredients to cobble together to make one. Perfect! We shared it and it was just enough for our tummies. We were only visiting Pittsburgh, but we'd definitely go back.  Thanks for a great snack!",

My chair would hit the persons chair behind/beside me whenever they or I would sit or move. A group of Caucasians came in after us and received their meal prior to us and when we did finally get our meal it was cold. We had to request that it be put back on the grill. It came out warm the next time around with no steam or heat. We ordered the filet and the lamb and both were disgusting. We requested our meat to be medium and the filet came out burnt on the outside and rare on the inside.

We were definitely over dressed with many patrons in jeans and tshirts. They had a lunch menu and dinner menu (lunch being just smaller portions of the dinner menu). I enjoyed their lobster special, which tasted fresh. My date got the veal parmesan, which was ok- not great. All in all, it was an okay place for a date, though a little pricey for the atmosphere and food quality. One of those places you go to once but probably not a return spot for us.",

The view is what drew us there, but the food is what will keep us going back. I can only speak for my own meal, which was the salmon, but I will assure you that THAT is how salmon is supposed to be prepared. It was absolutely phenomenal.. and I've eaten a lot of salmon- that was by far the best! Everyone else loved their meals as well, and finished every bite.  I had a red sangria as my drink and, again, it was perfect.   Our service was totally on point, and that paired with our amazing view of our beautiful city couldn't have been better.   Just a short walk from the top of the Duquesne Incline and the overlook, the location is very convenient and easy to find and get to. There is a parking lot right across the street that is $10 to use, but makes it much quicker and easier than searching for street parking.",

    "text": "We were excited to try Vue412. Getting to look out over Pittsburgh and enjoy a new restaurant. We went on a Thursday and it was a quiet night there. We got a great table overlooking Heinz Field and the rivers. It was lovely. The wine selection was very nice with nothing too crazy expensive. The menu, too, was terrific. I was the one who couldn't decide, but everyone else found something right away. We got...lobster mac-n-cheese, chicken Romano, chicken parmesan, and salmon with tortellini. Everything dish was prepared so well. They were all terrific. Our favorite; the lobster mac-n-cheese. The person in our party that doesn't usually finish meals polished this off!! We got one dessert to share; death by chocolate. Yum! The owner/manager came over to the table twice (Joe). He was very nice. He told us a little trivia about the rivers we didn't know. He told us everything is made there, farmed locally, and to order. Jason, our server, brought us our calamari appetizer very quickly and our meals nicely spaced afterward. We were in a bit of a time crunch, but we didn't feel rushed. It was just right.  Pricing ran about $30 per person with 2 wines, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert and 4 entrees.   I would say, however, the ambience needs to be updated. It seems like this used to be a different restaurant and re-opened as Vue412. Oh, and the bathrooms are on the third floor!?!  But, really, try it. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Made a reservation for 8:15pm on a Saturday night about a week in advanced. We arrived and checked in at the restaurant at exactly 8:15pm. The host took our name and stated our table was not ready yet because another party was still there and they were just on their entrees. I was aggravated  but then asked why did no one contact me to tell me to come later or why is there not another table. The host honestly said he didn't know but the party that was there has been there since 5pm so they should be done soon. He offered us to go stand in the doorway because there was no seats or go down to the bar but there's no seats and to stand. I didn't have any other option so the bar we went. The bartender was nice but frankly I think she needed help, she was running around and tracking people down to pay tabs with her before they went to their tables.  We waited about 20-30 mins before we were seated. The server was nice, he did give us a free appetizer of our choice, since we waited- I thought that was very nice especially because we didn't even mention it to him.  App- bada-bing shrimp. So good I could eat a whole plate of those. The flavor and texture was great and not fried and heavy.  Drink- Rose' infused vodka with fresh Basil, strawberries and mint. This drink was amazing not to sweet not overly powering it was lift and refreshing.  Meal 1 - chicken Romano with the fettuccine- huge piece of chicken, breaded and fried to perfection  Meal 2- Osso Bucco - meat fell off the bone literally.   The food is what I was most nervous about and it was seriously delicious and not as over priced as some Mt. Wash spots.   It was rocky at first but the view of the city and the food made it a lot better. I would go back!",

    "text": "5 star view with 2.5 star food.   No valet parking, but there is a lot for $10 right across the restaurant. The restaurant is currently undergoing some needed interior renovations so things may seem a bit out of place. The chairs were uncomfortable to sit in for more than 20 minutes and the tabletops were lined with paper - not really something you'd expect from a seemingly high-end restaurant, especially on Mt. Washington.   For appetizers, we opted for the calamari and meatballs. For the price of the calamari, we were definitely hoping for more than a half a cup of calamari, like they forgot the rest of it - the hot peppers that came with them were delicious. For my entree, I ordered the chicken parmesan with gnocchi. The chicken was properly cooked and juicy but the gnocchi and sauce seemed a bit dried up like it had been sitting for some time, and the chicken was added to the top right before being brought to the table. Nothing really to write home about.   For desserts, we ordered the Death by Chocolate cake, the peanut butter cake, and the lemon cake. Both the death by chocolate cake and peanut butter cake were so-so, kind of dried out, nothing really special. The lemon cake was probably the best one out of the 3 desserts, definitely get this if you order a dessert.   Service was alright, but definitely could have been better. An order ticket was stuck to the bottom of one of our plates when the food was brought out. Waitstaff did a messy job packing up leftovers right between our 2 guests, clumsily stacked plates right in front of one of our guests as they packed up the food, and didn't bother to wipe the sauce off the bag the food was in.    Would I be returning for the food, atmosphere, and service? Not at all. I would go back for the view alone, but there are several other restaurants on Mt. Washington that I would gladly visit first",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past 4th of July with my wife and two other couples for dinner.  Our group leader had made reservations for this table in May and had specified a window table and so we were interested in seeing what we we got.  My wife and I arrived to Vue 412 at 7:15 even though our reservations weren't until 8 PM as we wanted to get a drink at the bar.  As we drove up the restaurant I was looking for a valet.  Unfortunately there wasn't one which means that I was left to park on my own on Mt Washington on the 4th of July.  Ugh!  Thankfully I was able to secure one of the 3 spots left in the parking lot across the street even if we got gouged a little at $20 cash.   After making it inside my wife and I checked in with the host and then proceeded downstairs to the bar.  The downstairs of this restaurant has about 4 or 5 4-tops looking out into the city and then a bar that seats around 6 facing away from the view.  On the day that we were there it was hot downstairs and I would not have been happy if we had to stay down there for a long time.  Thankfully we didn't and the bartender was nice and got me my beer and my wife her wine.  About 15 minutes later another member of our party arrived and we were told we could head to our table.  What a table it was too as it was in its own secluded room on the second floor with a perfect view towards the city and could fit exactly six people.  If that wasn't good enough it also had its own AC unit which means that our dining experience was significantly better temperature wise than the people who were along the windows just outside our room.    For dinner on this evening Vue 412 had their special dinner menu out.  That meant a few different entree choices but mostly a raise in price in the normal entrees.  They didn't gouge you though and if you take into account our view of the fireworks, I thought it was well worth it.  In any case my wife and I started out by splitting the calamari appetizer which we ordered around 8.  Then when our appetizers came around 8:15 or so I went with the osso bucco for my entree while my wife with the salmon.  The calamari here was decent as the breading was light and the calamari was cooked pretty well.  After we finished that we then sat around for while and then even longer.  It got to the point where all of our table was wondering where our food was.  Thank goodness we had ordered those appetizers or else I would have been starving.  Finally, a good hour and 45 minutes or so later, our entrees made it.  This ended up coinciding perfectly with the grand finale of the fireworks (they started a little later than the advertised 9:30).  I know the restaurant was slammed due to the fireworks but they had to expect that and should have been better prepared.  My osso bucco ended up tasting pretty good.  It was flavorful and fell off the bone quite easily.  The sides that came with it were garlic mashed potatoes as well as carrots and asparagus.  All of the sides were pretty bland although cooked well.  Still, you wouldn't find me ordering them if given the choice at a restaurant.  By the time our waitress made it back to our table it was 10:30 or so and so my wife and I had been here for over 3 hours.  I don't remember our waitress offering us a dessert menu and I am pretty sure that no one would have taken her up on it anyways.  That's a shame too as I think with quicker service that my wife might have ordered their death by chocolate.   The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back here again in the future.  If it's the view you are after with some mediocre food, then by all means head here as our room and view was fantastic.  However the slow service and bland sides left me wanting more from the restaurant even with it being the 4th of July.",

Beans and greens was like a sloppy soup served with a non generous four \"toast points\" which were limp probably because it was so hot in there! Banana peppers were meh. Beet salad had just a few slices of beets (apparently I gave my boyfriend the side eye when he tried to eat just one...so not an abundance), overall presentation was a mountain of spinach dumped out into the plate. So, not so much a beet salad. Maybe it was beet because it was so hot in there, IDK. Everything was suspiciously warm because the AC wasn't working.  Definitely not worth the trip. Bring a sandwich from home and walk around mt washington for the Vue412.",

I started out with the shrimp bisque since it was like 20 degrees outside. It was so warm and velvety. My friend got the steamed mussels with sausage and it was freaking yuuuuge! A meal in and of itself!  I had the seafood trio with pappardelle. It consisted of creamy soft scallops, a white fish (cod i thunk) and giant prawns. I don't think the pasta was homemade though.

After chatting with the bartender, we confirmed that we were celebrating a special occasion. So I believe he told the front desk to give us a good table. And we got a great table! We were on the top floor in a private room for 6 of us.   It was absolutely beautiful view from the top of the restaurant. We had drinks flowing the entire dinner, our waitress was great and even the bartender was running drinks up to our table. Great service overall.   Appetizers- The memorable ones were Brussels sprouts and the hummus. Both were amazing and the hummus was, I think mixed with squash? It was really good.   Dinner- overall good. I got a salad but most of the table got seafood and pasta. All liked their dishes.   Dessert- creme brulee and the chocolate cake. Both great way to end a meal.   Overall we would go back for amazing views, good food and great service.",

    "text": "What a pleasant lunch Christmas Eve.  I have to confess we were headed to my go-to restaurant atop Mt. Washington, that of Grandview Saloon.  However, it was not open for lunch so saw Vue 412's sidewalk blackboard announcing its specials so headed inside.    My husband and I were cordially greeted by owner or manager perhaps? I do not know but he seemed very gracious in seating us and checking on us later at our table.  The menu had plenty of enticing options.  I went for a special -- barramundi fish with green beans and potatoes.  The fish was mild and fatty -- very tasty.  Presentation was very eye-pleasing.  And the prices for lunch (until 3pm) was very fair.  Everything I saw on the menu was in the 13.00 to 15.00 range.  Even the dinner menu options looked fairly priced in the 20's to low 30's.    Opted for the Death by Chocolate to split between the two of us and it was huge and very good, chocolaty and moist.  There was a 10 percent discount for checking into Yelp, as well.  Oh, did I forget to mention the view???  Wonderful view of the point, downtown, and the north shore.  Note that there is no outside dining when it comes time for nicer weather, but a nice venue for indoor dining.  Oh, just a P.S.  Our server was fun and outgoing but we had to watch out for anything liquid he placed in front of us, as in coffee or refilling water.  He was definitely a serious slosher/splasher.  Nervous, medical, or holiday cheer?  All was good, nonetheless!",

    "text": "For the last night of our extended weekend in the area, I booked this place based mostly on the reviews and the views.  It is located on a ridge overlooking Pittsburgh and the confluence of its rivers.  I requested a window table when I reserved, and even though we shifted the reservation an hour earlier that day, they were still able to accommodate us.   The drive up to this area is not trivial from downtown, though it is within sight when you begin.  You basically have to cross the river and loop around to the back of the ridge and then do a steep climb on one of the streets there.  I guess you could go super-touristy and take the incline up, but we skipped it.  A number of the restaurants along Grandview appear to offer valet parking.  We turned onto Cohassett and found street parking available, so we took that.  It was about a half-block walk from there. We were seated promptly.  The restaurant appears to cater to couples on an evening out and larger family-parties.  The view from our table was great, as expected.   Our server was very professional.  We had time to review the menu and make our selections. My wife had the salmon; I opted for the butternut squash ravioli, which was quite good.  The restaurant has a full bar also.   We split their 'death by chocolate' for dessert, as it had been cited in some reviews.  That was actually the only under-whleming part of the meal - it was just very average.    Overall, if you're looking for a memorable meal while you're in Pittsburgh (perhaps from a touristy perspective), this is a good choice.",

They were both okay, but with the view like that it's hard to not enjoy the atmosphere. The restaurant definitely feels a bit dated but maintained well.   Now for the highlight!!!   I got the Lobster Mac & Cheese as the entree and it is freaking delicious  !  The lobster tail has a nice white wine flavor, and that ball of lobster butter really take this dish to the super amazing level , perhaps the best lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had.    The lunch portion goes for under $20 bucks (18 if I remembered correctly), which is a bargain for any lobster dishes. Oh and the place has a great city view over the Pittsburgh skyline no matter where you sit. The veal Marsala dish is quite big but it's dinner portion. Pretty good as well! - Pittsburgh is an amazing city. Hopefully I could visit again soon! And if you are around the tram area, this might be the best place to dine in. I'll definitely come back to get this lobster Mac and cheese again!",

There was a worker wearing sweatpants who I think may have been a chef and ermmm doesn't really match the ambience of the place.  (Valentine's Day menu) LOBSTER BISQUE: Salty and way too chunky. (Waiter did say \"oh the crab bisque?\" At first so I don't know if it was even lobster) PRIME RIB: Huge cut of meat and a baked potato. Portion size was crazy so I guess it was worth the money. Bland and a little fatty so it was too chewy rather than tender.  I did happen to get a glass of Merlot and that was the best part of the meal, lol.  Couldn't bear getting a dessert because I didn't want to stay any longer. They treated us well with service so that'll be the only reason I won't give it a 1 but the food..  that's enough to not bring me back.  If you're making your way up to the incline, don't waste your time here and spend the extra bucks at Lemont or maybe Altius.",

For a lack of better words I had to \"spit out\" the steak in my napkin because it was so chewy and fatty. They never asked what kind of dressing I wanted. I just assumed it would come with a vinegar based dressing.  The salad came with ranch.  Goat cheese and ranch do not go well together ....I would have definitely chosen a different meal. But I was not that hungry that's why I chose the salad option ... for $17 dollars.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is the service was fast and friendly and my husbands veal parmigiana was tasty. And they gave my friend a wine glass filled with cotton candy for his birthday. I would definitely go with another option . Overpriced",

The manager made sure my chicken was cooked thoroughly and to make up the fact that my $24 meal was raw offered to buy me dessert.  It was a nice gesture but I don't think it was an appropriate response.  We're not the type of people to raise a fuss so we accepted the dessert and went on our way.

We started with the charcuterie board, which we always order wherever we go, and this was... interesting. I attached a photo because we both didn't think anyone would believe us unless they saw it. Almost positive the cheddar we were given was processed? Or just super cheap... I didn't eat the swiss but did have the other type which tasted like legit cheese. They didn't tell us anything that was on the board so we had to guess. As you can see, I think they just sliced up their sandwhich meat. Dumped a ton of olives, other pickled veggies you buy in a jar... ugh. And the volume of food made us feel guilty because there was no way in heck we could finish it all. A waste of not very great food. Husband wasn't happy about the steak he ordered. My ravioli was good, just not really worth the price.

I had the halibut special which was small and a bit overcooked. Wasn't very good. The dinners were served two at a time with an overly long time between the servings.

I can't even begin to tell you how pleased we all were with the food, and especially the service.  Our waiter, Nathan was outstanding.  He was very friendly, and the service he provided was above and beyond.  He was always checking in to make sure we had enough to drink, to make sure our appetizers were fine, and that we were all happy with our dinner selections.  The food was incredible.  My sons both had the Osso Bucco, and they raved about it, and the portion was quite substantial.  There was also the Tortellacci, Scallops, Veal Parmigiana, and I dined on a special of steak topped with crab.  Everyone raved about their dishes, and the portions were all plenty.

We will definitely ask to be seated at your table the next time we dine.",

So we get seated and wait a good while for the waiter. We are there for brunch and don't see brunch buffet anywhere. They sit us on the lowest level of the restaurant. There are three floors. So we are waiting for someone to take drink orders and I notice my moms water glass already has lipstick smudged all over it. Gross. And one of the coffee cups was also dirty. Some of the silverware wasn't washed that well either. Waiter finally comes, takes our drink orders and hustles off. We are told brunch is on the third floor. Which seems weird as hell.   We have to traipse up two big flights of stairs to this top level where they only seat parties of like 15 to get to this fairly mediocre brunch buffet. The food, while having lots of choices, wasn't amazing. You're definitely paying for the view. So we had to wait in a line to get food, seemed a bit disorganized. And had to go balance our plates while we walked back down various stairways while trying not to bump into people. My mom doesn't have great knees. This was tough.   Our food is cold by time we get downstairs. The coffee we ordered is also cold because waiter must've poured it while we were long gone. So we ate. I forgot to ask for syrup and at first the waiter just told me I'd have to walk back upstairs with my plate to get it but he graciously grabbed it for me. Points for him. For that.   Water wasn't refilled much even when I asked. The coffee never got that hot when refilled. My dad tried to use a Just Pay Half deal and they wouldn't accept it since it was a brunch or something. So now we have to come back even though we don't really want to. The buffet was no better than a glorified hotel brunch to me. I don't know. Got a weird vibe from the place. Weird service. Saw some ants crawling around. Just wasn't fully what you hope for in terms of a nice breakfast for mom.   Anyway. That's my review.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner, and we loved it! We had a great view of the city and sunset and early evening. Our waiter, Joe, was very helpful with our wine selection. We split the meatball appetizer which was very good. He had the filet mignon (which in retrospect, he would have asked to be done medium rare, not medium), which came with mashed potatoes and green beans, and he loved it. I had the gnocchi with sausage and it was incredible! I can't recommend that meal enough. We split the creme brulee for dessert and they also brought us complimentary limoncello, which they make in-house and that was such a lovely treat. If you're concerned about parking, you can find free street parking down one of the side streets, or use the $10 cash lot near the restaurant. If you're visiting Pittsburgh and want a great meal for a great value, definitely go to Vue 412!",

Joe,the manager, was so friendly and accommodating. We were helped with our food selections with Jennifer, our exceptional waitress!  We started with appetizers such as the crispy BadaBing shrimp with a special spicy sauce. Next was the stuffed banana peppers served in a skillet, and next the fried calamari with roasted garlic olive oil,red peppers,banana peppers with saffron aioli. All the appetizers were so flavorful. JENNIFER recommended the \"special\" for the evening and it was Surf & Turf. OMG!!!!!!! It was the BEST we have ever  eaten. The filet was cooked to perfection and soooo delicious! The lobster tail was stuffed with crab meat also so fresh and oh so mouth watering. The entree was accompanied with tricolor carrots and roasted potatoes. The chef,BRYAN,has been there for 6 months and has brought the menu to new heights.JOE, along with his staff have elevated this restaurant's culinary skills!!!!!",

Is great.  Our waiter, Nathan was fabulous. He described the specials and allowed us to order one course at a time.  The Bada Bing Shrimp was great. Very tangy and not overly breaded. And fairly large pieces of shrimp.  A test for us is always what the wait staff do with used silverware. Ours was replaced after each course.  The bread was warm (another test) and dipping oil was great. Infused (hate that word) with sun dried tomatoes.  We both ordered Chicken Picatta with artichokes.  Very good. Cream sauce was flavorful but not too heavy. Also, served hot.  The grand finale was peanut butter creme brulee.  Fabulous.  Overall a wonderful date night and we will be back.",

That said....Liz and Joe assisted with that concern but I make note of it here for the kitchen as for now, I'm not positive I would go back considering the True cost of a meal here vs the food that was served. But, overall I note I'm a fan so....we'll probably give them another try.",

    "text": "I came here for restaurant week and had a 7:30pm reservation with another couple for a double-date.  We were seated downstairs which is not as nice as the other floors because it sort of had a basement vibe. The view, though, is amazing.  It seems they were understaffed and the staff got overwhelmed by the number of guests as we had to wait a long time for food.  I did not see any staff just hanging around and wasting time-- they were definitely working hard.  The appetizers took about 30-40 minutes to come out and they didn't all come out together so we ended up sharing as they arrived.  I got the mussels and the sauce that it was in was spicy and warm, but the sausage that was in it was cold...   Then we waited another 45 minutes for the main course to come out and it must have been sitting out because it was cold so I didn't really enjoy it.  Dessert only took about 10 minutes to come out because they were pre-prepared, even the creme brulee, which I don't think should ever be pre-prepared.  Overall, I did not enjoy my food because it was cold but I didn't send it back because I felt bad for the waitstaff.   During the time we were there, the waitstaff apologized several times to other patrons at the bar because of how long they waited.  I did not notice any turnover in the tables downstairs... basically everyone downstairs waited a long time for food.  We left the restaurant around 9:30...  Overall, I was very disappointed with the food.  They do have a lot of potential and perhaps they're much better when there are fewer guests, but I would not recommend them based on my experience.",

Brussels sprouts were good because bacon and sweet chili sauce. The greens and beans were literal soup, we barely touched the stuffed banana peppers, the lamb burgers were inexcusable frozen patties. We gave up sending things back and just stared at each other perplexed. We went for a birthday and we will NEVER return.  It was actually sad how bad it was. It was a waste of food, money and time.

During dinner our server asked if everything was ok, I said it'd been better with a view at one of the (still) empty tables. He walked off so after dinner I left a note on our bill about his service and he chased us out of the restaurant to sarcastically yell at me from behind \"thanks for the tip princess! Have a nice night!\"  I replied \"thanks for the view.\"  No class and just plain rude all the way around. Smh Won't be back and don't recommend the place at all.  Addition: to further show the lack of waiter's class, he read this review and marked it funny. Totally distasteful establishment.",

    "text": "My mom wanted to dine at a restaurant with a nice view for dinner so we made reservations at Vue 412.  The experience already started off badly when we arrived and were told that we had no reservations. Even when I showed them the confirmation e-mail the employee just sounded confused and tried to book me for the next available table. We had also requested seating by the window, but were told that none were available unless we would be able to finish in 45 minutes which is ridiculous. And then an hour into our meal, I receive a call from the restaurant asking if I'm going to be arriving for my reservation. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  On to the food:  Complimentary Bread (5/5): served with a delicious olive and tomato tapenade.  Mussels (4/5): these were really good and the best thing we had all night.  Steak Salad (2/5): my mom found the lettuce not very fresh and her steak wasn't seasoned well.  Osso Bucco (3/5): the pork was very soft and fell off the bone, but everything was just very salty.  Veal Piccatta (2/5): the lemon sauce was very diluted and everything just tasted under-seasoned.  Overall the view was great, but not so much for the customer service and food. We also noticed that all the Caucasian customers were seated by the windows, while my party, another Asian party, and an African American party were seated in the upper area. Would not recommend dining here.",

The hostess kept checking in to update us on our table. We were sat a half hour early which was nice. Our server was Kayla S (ask for her) she was GREAT! She was very helpful with the menu and so nice. We ordered the scallops and a fried goat cheese salad and then strawberry shortcake and a chocolate mouse for dessert. The salad was the most amazing blend of ingredients for a salad, the goat cheese was warm and the apples were just sweet enough. It was delicious. The scallops were cooked perfect and so tasty. They were on top of a fried risotto patty that was the type of food you crave. Desserts were delicious too. Our server Kayla was very attentive. She looked to be so busy and running everywhere, but was still so pleasant and really took the time to find out how our dinner was. Highly recommend",

If you haven't had dinner on Mt. Washington and looked down onto the city at night you are missing out. I did think the food was generally solid, but not more than that. I had a filet that was ordered medium, but came out medium well. The service was fine and the drink selection was up to par.   There were some issues, the first being an abundance of flies around the table and neighboring area. The decor could use an upgrade as both my wife and I separately decided to try different chairs as our original ones sunk in a bit too deep. The price was a bit too high for what we got and the general ambiance.",

Our appetizer came before our drinks when we ordered them at the same time. Our dinner took forever to come and was luke warm when it finally arrived. Our server didn't stop by to check on us until we were almost complete with our meal so we had to stop the hostess a few times to ask for additional items. We denied dessert initially because of how long it was taking but then opted to try something, it was my mother in laws birthday after all. 20 minutes later our server comes by and says \"they haven't brought your dessert? I thought someone would have gotten it to you by now\". So the servers wait around for other people to run their food and let it sit in the window rather then checking on it. We asked for the dessert to be canceled and our check to be provided.   The view is about the only good thing of this place.",

    "text": "Saturday night - bright lights! Big cities! Nature Boy! Woooooo!! Looking at places to eat on a Saturday night after a long day of shopping and a nap - came across this spot due to the view and recommendation upon taking requests from my party.   We called ahead to see about reservations around 8 and the gent on the tele told me to come in they had gotten slow since the dinner crowd. Low key worried me that 8pm on a Saturday the place would be slow.   At any rate we headed up the side of the hill and drove up to find that parking is a nightmare. A next door restaurant has valet and a parking garage etc - this spot didn't. Took some hunting but we found a spot on a side street and walked up. The place was slow - kitchen closes at 10, we had gotten there around 8:35 and were sat next to a window that overlooks the whole city. This is the main reason that people come, and was already worth it - but decided to give the food a try as well.   Waitress (tight ponytail and bow tie?) was very attentive, inviting and accommodating. Very big fan of her skills and making us feel welcome.   Ordered a mixed drink (fall fashioned) and a caprese salad for a starter. The drink was good - specialty mixed drink they had on a special menu. The caprese salad was good - just enough of tomato, basil, and balsamic to share. Plus dinner came with bread and an oil olive concoction to share.   For an entree, went with \"Parmesan Chicken\" which is chicken parmigiana - be sure of naming practice and with recommendation of waitress fired on linguine instead of gnocchi and got it without mushrooms. This dish was very good - well prepared and season properly. The chicken was breaded well and roped with cheese as usual- and the chicken was crispy. Plus the sauce / gravy was nice combination of chunky tomato and a medium grade thickness.   For dessert - we went with a nice lemon cello marscapone cake which was like heaven on a plate. Cake and cream was perfect, topped with powdered sugar, and plated with a lemon curd sauce drizzle and a stiff peak of whipped cream.   Overall this meal had it all- a perfect view, a quiet Italian restaurant that Billy Joel would sing about, good food, great service, perfect dessert, and a dream across the table. I would say next time we will come back in warmer months to give the views a walking chance.",

We wanted a great of view of Mt Washington and a place we could all be together.  Another restaurant on Mt Washington (I won't name names), wanted a $100 deposit, would limit the menu and could not accommodate separate checks. So I called VUE412. They had no problems with that large a group, so we booked it with the very friendly staff.  We got there and the staff was so great!  We had at least 3-4 servers taking orders, refilling drinks and taking care of our every need. They were so on the ball, and super friendly.  They were pretty busy too, but service staying consistently awesome.  Food was all really good. Everyone was pretty happy. A couple folks got slightly undercooked bacon so the staff was quick to replace it.   We were downstairs and felt like we had a private party room for a bit which was really nice.   Oh, and did I mention the most amazing views??  The only downside, which is probably True of anyplace on Mt Washington is that the bathroom was up two flights stairs. So be aware if you have anyone in your party with special needs.",

The windows are smudged and dirty as if no one has taken a bottle of windex and paper towels to them in a long time. The floors are carpeted and I'm guessing aren't cleaned that much either because there is a musty smell throughout the restaurant. Our waiter was trying his hardest to do everything himself, as he was the host and bartender as well. We ordered a charcuterie board which took over an hour to come out and got me nauseous halfway through eating. My girlfriend and I were going to split a cheese burger and a flatbread pizza with sausage and meatballs (I believe they call it was meat lovers). The flat bread pizza was a soggy piece of flat bread with canned tomato sauce and sparing pieces of shredded cheese and almost no sausage; did not taste good at all. I took one bite of the burger and got even more nauseous. All in all I spent over $60 and left still hungry and now nauseous. The only reason this wasn't getting one star was because of the effort our waiter was putting in to try to do everything himself.",

    "text": "** Overpriced and very mediocre food, nothing special except the view. Better off checking out one of the other incline resturants.  I came here on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend, scheduling around 5:15 pm hoping to enjoy a nice meal and watch the sunset together (yes I know, cheesy af). It was too bad that it was rainy that day, which definitely obstructed the view, but theres not much they can do about it. Later on in the night, they definitely turned on too many lights inside which caused a bad glare on the windows to make the view hard to see which was 90% of the reason I came. Going with a dim light would make for both a more intimate experience as well as a better view in my opinion.   It was nice that we were provided window seats upon arriving, as well as a flower for my girl and coat service. However, I do have to say that the interior just didn't really match my expectations of it being a nice restaurant on the incline. A lot of the tables seemed out of place for the more upscale ambiance I expected it to have for being on the incline, especially compared to places like Le Mont, which looks and makes you feel very lavish for dining at.   I mainly choose this place for the view, and the food didn't really seem up to par with the hype or prices. We both ordered the 14 ounce prime rib entrees, as well as one lobster bisque and a merlot, the total coming a bit over $100 (no discounts were taking unfortunately for check in or groupon). We did eat on the Valentine's Day menu, so naturally prices were marked up, but in my opinion the food was extremely average and nothing special.   I will say that I am satisfied with the amount of meat that came with it, but something seemed off about the flavor and both me and my girlfriend ended up not finishing ours as some areas just didn't taste great for lack of better words. Even if this place is advertised to be more casual, I would have expected the prices to match that, but unfortunately I found this place to be very overpriced and overhyped.",

Washington and overlooks the city. Unfortunately, my request was not honored even though there was an open table by the window when we arrived and for over an hour after we ordered. A couple who walked in and sat at the bar ended up getting it later. We were seated right next to the bar and by the back of the house/dishwasher so it was pretty noisy.   I also checked on their website several times leading up to New Years to see whether there was any special event or tasting menu offered and there was nothing mentioned. However, a prix fixe menu was given to us along with the regular menu when we were seated. It was not explained to us that the prix fixe was the ONLY option until I tried to order something from the regular menu. Not a big deal, but I think it should have been mentioned on the website or when we made the reservation a month prior.   The food was pretty good and portions were fairly generous. The view is obviously the highlight. I would probably go back and order off the regular menu and insist on sitting upstairs in the main dining area.",

Another 30 - 45 minutes then they brought a mixture of salads and entrees together. Complained and they said there was a mix up. Complained to the manager and he said \"What do you want me to do?\" Really? How about catering to your customers. After waiting another 20 minutes with no one coming by to see what we wanted, where the rest of our meals and drinks where, we decided to just leave. Found the manager on the way out to tell him we were leaving. He said the meals were comp' d. Duh. Never did he offer us any incentive to come back. That's okay. We won't.

The View was the best thing about it and our sweet waitress, who was very apologetic about the slow service.   We were seated upstairs and outside on maybe the most humid evening of the year which was a bit of a let down.   The food was decent. I got the salmon for dinner which was good, although slightly overlooked. For dessert I got the lemon marscapone cake which was good but nothing special. Basically only three dessert on the menu were available because they were either out of it or it was frozen (you read that right, FROZEN).  For the location this place seems like the overall experience should be up to par with its neighbors, Altius and LeMont but it definitely falls short.    All the waitstaff was very sweet. The whole operation just seems poorly managed.",

My fiance and I ordered a lobster Mac and cheese dish and the salmon with fig. The salmon was great. The Mac and cheese had so much cheese it seemed more like a fondue pot.

We also had the spinach, mashed potatoes and green bean sides. The menu didn't indicate that the entrees came with a starch and a veggie so we could have skipped the extra sides.  We all enjoyed our entrees immensely. We then ordered the creme brulee and coconut cream pie for dessert which were mediocre at best. Both lacked any real flavor and were disappointing after the great entrees and sides.   Accolades for the wine list, entrees and sides.  Thumbs down for the desserts.

The service was okay - not great, but you have a great view, so I guess you don't want great service anyway, so you stay a bit longer and enjoy the view?  The blackened scallops on fried green tomatoes were amazing and totally worth the trip. The salad was also good and Bryan's dessert was very good, too. The drinks were good and pricey. The parfait (and I LOVE parfaits) was horrible and made me google the definition of parfait to see if their dessert qualified (it doesn't). A parfait is supposed to be \"a dessert consisting of layers of ice cream, fruit, etc., served in a tall glass.\" Sadly, this dessert was dry cake layered with a mashed blackberry sauce & topped with whipped cream. Not at ALL what I thought I was getting and too dry (even with the sauce) to be remotely worth the calories. Everything else was great, but the dessert and service were a bit disappointing - especially since we were there before the restaurant got crowded. I would really like to return when the view is less cloudy and once it's dark, since I do love that view at night.",

We had to wait about 10 minutes just to be offered a wine menu. Upon our waiter's return, he dropped off bread and did not ask us if we cared to order a drink. We had to stop him. It took about 15 minutes to get a glass (keep in mind the restaurant was not at all busy).   My meal was terrible. I had the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster was very fishy and tasted as though it was previously frozen. It had various types of peppers in it and the overall flavor was just not good.   The only thing this restaurant had going for it was the view. However, upon arrival, they did not have record of our reservation even though we had a confirmation email. There were a number of tables available but we were placed at a table that seated 6 (there were 3 of us) in a corner. There were plenty of 4 top tables available - it was just odd.",

Parking - good; there is street parking, a lot across from the restaurant that's a flat rate of $10; some scattered street parking 1-2 blocks back that is free.  Food - excellent. We had the calamari to start, then I had the lobster tails and my boyfriend had the lobster mac and cheese. Both were great. His was a bit too rich for my liking, but he loved it.  Drinks - pretty good. They have a long list of signature cocktails and wine, but not as many beer choices.  Service - only thing that wasn't great. Our appetizer took almost 30mins to come out. It also took our waitress 10+ minutes to ask if we wanted another drink, and she didn't bring any water until after our meals came out. Not the worst I've ever had, but for a nearly $200 meal between two people, you might expect a little bit more.  Also, side note - couldn't help but notice the thermostat read a warm '81' when we first walked in.. they had a fan blasting in the area we were seated, but wondering if something was wrong with the air conditioning? Or if they  just elected to turn it off? Unclear.",

I brought a couple of out of towners here for dinner after showing them Mount Washington. We didn't make a reservation, but we were still able to get a table, although there was limited space.  Drinks: Everyone ordered beer except me. I tried the \"Vue the Cosmos\" and the \"Fall Fashioned\". The Cosmo was decent - almost too sweet, but not quite. The Fall Fashioned was a mistake. It was way too sweet and tasted like I could almost chew it. The drinks were $12 each (it doesn't have a price on the menu).  Food: Our table ordered the salmon, chicken parm, scallops special, lobster mac n cheese, and calamari appetizer. The calamari was chewy. The salmon was good, but the slaw on top was gross and the risotto was really bland. The chicken in the chicken parm was cooked well, but the sauce was bland. The scallops were chewy and it tasted like they wanted to get rid of the rest of their spices, or they were trying to cover something up. The lobster mac and cheese was probably the best out of everything, but still sounded much better than it actually tasted.  Our waitress was fine. Our water was always full and she gave us extra bread when we asked. She took our order quickly and was friendly.  I wouldn't come here again. I'd stick with Monterrey Bay Fish Grotto. I think the food is a little more expensive, but the view is amazing and the food is SO MUCH BETTER!!",

We enjoyed the view as sun set. After dinner, we walked down the street to the incline and took a ride up and down the incline and looked at more of the pretty lights of the city.

    "text": "I was very very disappointed with this restaurant. This place is skating by on it's amazing view, that's for sure. My family and I (total of 7 people) went here to celebrate my graduation from undergrad. I made the reservations months before and was so excited because I read the reviews and looked it up online, and it seemed promising. But, that was not the case.  We were a few minutes late because we got stuck in traffic, but they were very sweet about it and put us up in our own private room upstairs with the best view, but I think that's were it went downhill.  Before I get into it, I just want to say that our waitress was absolutely amazing and so sweet. None of this was her fault.  We sat down probably around 6:15. We probably ordered around 6:30 all of our drinks and meals because we didn't want any apps. Only 3 of us got wine, and we probably didn't get that until 7. Our order was the salmon risotto, lobster mac and cheese, 2 spaghetti and meatballs, one fillet, one butternut squash ravioli, and 1 gnocchi with sausage.   It's almost if they had to fish for the lobster and salmon and kill the cow on site, that's how long it took. We did not get our food until after 8pm. We were all getting cranky because it was a long day, but still. Waiting almost 2 hours for food? You can only look outside at the bridges for so long before your stomach starts hurting. The food was very average. I felt as though I got short changed because everyone's portions were very generous, and I got a little fist full of risotto with probably 5oz of salmon and vegetables.  Our dishes did not seem complicated, and I do not understand what the issue was that took our order so long. By the time we ate, the sun had set and there were no lights in our private room, so we were pretty close to eating in darkness.   I had high hopes for this restaurant, and it was just so painfully average at very expensive prices. My advice: don't go there if you have somewhere to be, and definitely fill up on the bread because who knows when you'll be eating.",

We all arrived a bit early because traffic worked in our favor that afternoon. The staff were super accommodating and set our table up early and even let us in before the restaurant was even open so we could sit down.   The view is...spectacular. It was especially nice because we hit it during sunset and during the holidays when the tree below was lit up. We were seated right next to the window which allowed us to take in the view throughout our entire meal.   Our group is loud, partly because that's just how we are and partly because we only see each other in person every few months, so we like to chat and catch up. Our server was outstanding dealing with our large, boisterous group. His name was Patrick and I hope he gets a huge pat on the back for his amazing service! He had to re-explain the specials to us probably 10 times because people didn't hear or weren't paying attention. He was so accommodating to special requests and made suggestions for items which were all delicious.   The food was amazing. Everyone loved their dishes. The portion sizes were perfect. Although the price is high, the quality of the food coupled with the great service and atmosphere, in my opinion, justify the price.   No one had a single complaint, our dining experience was phenomenal from start to finish. Great job Vue 412! We may return for future holiday gatherings!",

The only reason I gave them 4 stars is the lobster tail that I added onto my salad (and paid an extra $12 for) was very skimpy..... Could not have been 2 ounces total.  I didn't complain because I didn't ask how much lobster would have been added to the salad prior to ordering.  The other 3 entrees we had were delicious as well as the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer.  The chocolate dessert and cheesecake for dessert was excellent!",

The second time I came for dinner during restaurant week and had a good experience. Great food and ambiance. Have always had a nice view of downtown and neither times made a reservation. It's definitely more of an upscale venue especially for dinner but I do recommend if you're looking for something classy!",

The view of the city might be the best part of the whole experience. I definitely recommend Vue 412 to anyone who doesn't mind spending a little extra money on a nice evening on Mt Washington",

I give the food 2 stars. I had a flatbread (recommended by the waitress) and my husband had the Cuban sandwich. Both were very mediocre. Edible, but certainly nothing I would purchase again. I would have been much more pleased with chipotle, had one been available. The salads and burgers and I saw coming out of the kitchen didn't look appetizing and I saw one man salting his burger, which is never a good sign.  Service was also mediocre.   I have no idea why this place has 4 stars on Yelp.  Would I come back? No.",

    "text": "This was a fairly bizarre dining experience. The entry level dining room looks fine, but because we were a party of two the only window seats they said they had for us we're on the lower level, even though we made reservations for several days in advance. The seats were very uncomfortable, and they graciously swapped in an upstairs comfortable seat for me, because the downstairs seat was not good for my back. The wait staff continued to be gracious and accommodating to us, but near the end of our meal a young woman from out of town came for dinner alone and they seated her in what was by then an empty downstairs dining room, in a corner that had an obstructed view. She asked to be moved, but they told her no. I cannot understand that.  The downstairs seating area seems like a damp family rec room, and they use some kind of air freshener that irritated my sinuses.  Now for the food - - it's nice to find a place that can accommodate my celiac disease and vegetarian, almost vegan, preferences. The vegan polenta was delicious. And my husband's butternut squash Ravioli was also excellent, he said. The beet salad came on a bed of wilted greens--not intentionally wilted, simply not very fresh. The vinaigrette and goat cheese were nice, but the beets were few and not particularly flavorful. The other stater, beans and greens, were lemony and garlicky, had a nice texture, and tasted great.  For dessert we ordered the creme brulee. After one or two bites we pushed it away, because there was a little flavor and the texture was really unfortunate. Also, it seemed that they used Cool Whip rather than whipped cream on top, although I can't believe that so I might be wrong. It just didn't taste or feel like whipped cream. Including our 20% tip we spent $115 for two meatless entrees, two salads, a dessert, and one glass of wine. A good price for a place with that kind of view but not really worth it for that kind of food and ambiance.",

The shrimp and lobster mac were impeccable however the calamari was just ok. Overall, this is a gem in disguise in mount Washington.

Another side note....parents, if you are paying top dollar for food and you are going to bring babies and toddlers out to eat please take some advise, learn how to control your kids.  That being said screaming babies and uncontrolled kids should be removed so that others can enjoy their dinners that they are paying good money for.

My wife and I came here for a Valentine's Day reservation like many other couples for the view and were very excited to try a new restaurant. In the end the food turned out fine, but to say the service was slow was an understatement. Since it was a holiday, we expected it to be busy, but it took 20-30 min to get a seat even though we had reservations. After getting to the table, it took the server another 30 min to get me another drink. The entree took another 45 min and we saw 2 tables that joked about sharing sticks of gum because their food was taking so long. The server was just absent.  Maybe we will try again, but it doesn't seem worth the price/time for your standard American fare.",

I had a couple fairly simple questions about the menu (which was excellent), nothing strange, just straightforward questions about preparation and they were met with indecisiveness and an offer to check with the kitchen. No big deal but at a place like this, you need to be able to describe the \"surf\" in the surf and turf when it isn't listed. I was told it was a white fish of some kind. Salmon is not a white fish. Again, it was good anyway but I could see some being pretty put off by that if you don't like salmon.  The entire main course was 3.5. There was nothing glaringly wrong, but the overall presentation and taste is not what I'd associate with a $45 price point. The drinks (pear martini and pomegranate Moscow mule) were 5 stars, hands down. Finished with a chocolate creme du pot or something. It was a solid 4 stars. In fairness, this place is a solid 3.5 stars with the view, but there is room to step it up. My suggestion would be to lower the prices 20-25% and reduce the menu to accommodate that. I'd be a frequent customer but I can't completely justify the value at this point with better options within walking distance.",

    "text": "This place sucked, bad food, bad service, good view!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They want me to make this longer so blah blah blah go stillers   Ok so I did write this the day I came in so here was are experience since you wanted to know. I made reservations at 8 and when I got there the hostess told me they didn't have a table for us and they could only seat us in the lounge, which you might as well call the basement filled with lawn furniture, besides the window view it was run down and depressing down there with plastic furniture. We ordered crab dip, it was served with tortilla chips, reminded me of something I would get at eat n park. Then we got the clam chowder, almost positive it came out of a can. We also ordered a $10 Caesar salad and that took forever to come out, the waitress informed us that the salad maker quit which I though was weird for her to share with us. Oh before I forget, get a real sign outside not that plastic banner, take a walk up the street and check out altius, you're charging the same prices as them, learn what a real high end restaurant looks like. Back to the salad, when we got it it was a plate of romaine drenched in Caesar dressing, no anchovies, no croutons and no cheese. So for our entrees, I got a bacon cheeseburger with green beans. It came out without bacon on it other than that it was fine, probably a step below a red robin burger but still ok, definitely not worth $15. The green beans were fresh but came out untrimmed, every green bean had 1\" hard, woody stems coming of each end. My girlfriend got your $39 ribeye and asked for it medium rare. Your ribeye is described as having a garlic and roasted shallot butter. Here's what she got, the cheapest, thinnest piece of meat I've ever seen with so much chili seasoning on it that it was impossible to eat. Where do you shop for your meat at the 3 day super sale at shop n save, it was a joke. We immediately informed the waitress that we were not happy with the steak and told her to remove it. I found it odd that a manager wouldn't even come down to see what the problem was. Now let's get to the service, the waitress never checked in with us, never refilled the water, forgot the same beer order twice, had no clue what was on the menu and made us feel like we were at the neighborhood dennys not what's supposed to be a upscale restaurant on mt Washington. Also where do you get off charging $15 for a gin martini and teach your wait staff the difference between straight up and on the rocks, they should know those things. In conclusion you are terribly overpriced, your food is lousy and you have a terrible wait staff, but hey at least you got that view!!!",

    "text": "I was really so excited to dine here tonight. Coleen assured me we would be well taken care of, (laughs) Well let me start by saying I had made these reservations three days in advance. I have nothing against a sports bar with a view, but don't act like I need reservations and tell me I'll be well taken care of just to seat me in what feels to be a man cave with a view. I'm sorry, a vue.There are only a few tables on the lower level. We were unfortunately pushed up against a party of 12 wildly loud elderly folk. Our entire table was unable to talk to one another because every ten seconds someone in the party would start screaming irrelevant statements. To make matters worse (Although I'm sure you don't believe me at this point)  My girlfriend found tinfoil in her salad. we actually just chose to leave. Wonderful for mix drinks and a view but not much else. Just keep that in mind. Yelp on.",

The food was very good though portions were large, the view was spectacular, and the staff were incredibly kind and respectful.  We shared the hummus appetizer, which was very good.  the bread and chips for the hummus were amazing.  I then ordered the scallops, which were very good, and my girlfriend ordered the chicken alfredo which was delicious.  Even though we showed up 45 minutes early, they still accommodated us and gave us a gorgeous table by the window.  I did mention in the reservation that it was a reunion and every staff member was very sweet about it.  The manager was the sweetest- after we finished our meal we sat in the exit waiting to leave and he came up to us, brought us back to the window and took pictures of us in front of the gorgeous view of Pittsburgh.  It was very special for a manager to take such a personal interest in a customer, or pair of customers.  It was, overall, an incredibly romantic spot.  I wouldn't change a thing.",

    "text": "What an amazing experience we had at Vue 412! My husband and I certainly picked the perfect place for superb dining with beautiful surroundings. We were seated at the window so we had a fantastic view from atop Mt Washington.  The servers were friendly. We were given an orange bread with fig compote. It was savory and a great way to start.  I had the tomato salad and my husband had the Moroccan Tomato soup. Both were flavored just right.  We were given a savory sorbet to cleanse the palate before our main meals. Again, delicious. For our main meals I got the porkchop dinner and he got the chicken Alfredo. Mine was delicious and his was beyond heavenly. The best chicken Alfredo either of us have ever eaten.  Now, the desserts sounded so tempting that we each got one and shared. The poached pear was seasoned perfectly and the Black Forest custard was creamy and very tasty. The Chef, Miko (spelling?), visited each table and explained how the dishes were prepared. He has only been there 2 weeks and you can see the passion he has for preparing amazing food. He worked in Japan and Germany for many years perfecting his craft. He incorporates flavors from his past experiences, pays homage to the region's history, and does this all wrapped up in amazing French style cooking. Sous chef, Sean, develops amazing hot and cold soups. You have to check this place out! The best part of his mission is to make delicious food that is affordable for the enjoyment of locals and visitors alike.  The atmosphere is laid back. We were in jeans and the people at the next table were more dressed up. It gives off a warm vibe of people coming together to enjoy an amazing meal.",

We were visiting the city, so she told us some little known facts and other restaurants to try. I literally wanted to move to Pittsburgh after speaking with her. This was a highlight of our trip- Definitely try it out!",

    "text": "Mr. Roman, thank you for getting back to me. Yes it was our first time as I just moved to Pittsburgh and had family visiting. I understand the pricing but the mussels definitely weren't worth the $19 as there was nothing to them. Also they forgot to make my boyfriends dinner and the waiter said he would take care of it but we paid for it. We didn't want to complain because we did have a nice time and we will try you again. Also we have no problem paying the prices nor do we expect a restaurant with that view to not be more than normal but portion size and timing of everything wasn't what we expected. We spent over 3hrs there. I work in the service industry so I understand what it takes to work out the kinks in a new establishment so we will be back to see how you grow. Thank you and your staff for making it fun.",

    "text": "Wow where to begin! The service was horrible. The waitress started by rolling her eyes when we all order soft drinks. She then informed us that the kitchen was backed up and it would be about an extra 15 minutes. We all agreed. After we gave her our order we asked if we could get some bread while we waited and she said no bread at lunch (after they just said we would need to wait for our meals). After 47 minutes (yes we timed it) and the waitress not coming over once to refill our drinks, 2 of the meals arrived. We had order 3 cheeseburgers and 1 grilled cheese. The first two burgers were cold with non melted cheese. After another 10 minutes, the third cold burger and grilled cheese arrived. The food was horrible. After the food was dropped off the waitress was no where to be found. The only good service we received was from the busboy who filled our drinks and apologized for the wait. This was the WORST service and food I have ever received. Go elsewhere for kind service and good food.",

    "text": "I went to Vue 412 with my girlfriend last night and overall it was a great experience. From the time I made the reservation to our whole dining experience, the staff was very courteous and knowledgable. After sitting down and looking at the menu, we noticed it was quite different from the online menu we viewed previously due to there being a new chef. Needless to say the view was priceless and a perfect setting for a date night. We started with the duck tacos (recommended from our waiter, Adam) and risotto balls which were both very good and had great flavor. Only a minor complaint that our entree (spaghetti bolognese) came out as we were still finishing up our appetizer. Our bolognese was delicious and definitely hit the spot. We then got tiramisu and creme brulee for dessert which was the perfect end to our meal. My only complaint as far as the dining experience was the choice of music that played throughout the restaurant. It sounded like it was the pop hits of the late 90s/early 2000s and meant more for a college Pregame rather than a nice dinner at a well todo restaurant.  While the music was off putting, the food and staff were great and when I'm back in town, I'd definitely dine here again!",

The fish dishes ordered (salmon and bass) were the best part of the meal and came with nice vegetable sides. Lobster bisque was fine. Lobster ravioli was pretty good. Everyone seemed apologetic about the bland, room temperature creme brulee that 3 of us had ordered and they brought us some complementary tiramisu after we reported how bad it was. It seemed like they genuinely wanted to provide good food and service but aren't quite there. My inlaws reported being unable to drink the coffee. The views were nice, though! If you want to come to the views, go for it, but just be aware that they are better than the food. You have to walk up multiple flights of stairs to get to the bathroom, so watch out for that, too, if you are not physically able.",

It's not very clean or modern inside. I feel like they could have had a good opportunity to really make this place sharp, but it's not. The pictures online look better than the place actually does. This isn't a dealbreaker necessarily, but it's worth noting.  All in all, if you're looking for somewhere nice to take an out-of-towner or just want a nice date night, Vue 412 is perfect",

    "text": "They ran out of everything but excuses and apologies!!!!   A party of 7 people for a birthday celebration turned into sheer disappointment.  We wanted to start the evening with a bottle of champagne.....they were out of champagne.  We asked for bread with the salad......they were out of bread.  Next, an order of red and white wine for the table.....they were out of the red wine we ordered.   The entrees were cold and presented with different sides than those listed on the menu.    After they were removed for reheating, the dinners came back on a small plate after the rest of the table had already finished eating with what looked like frozen bagged vegetables on the side.  When we questioned this, we were then served a plate of cold smashed potatoes.  There were several people walking around but only one waitress to handle the entire dining room.  The manager appeared to remain outside at the front door, avoiding any involvement with the operation. We heard nothing but apologies the entire evening.  We felt like we were in a Saturday Night Live skit!  And how did they remedy this?  More apologies.  I could go on, but suffice is to say, don't waste your time.  There are several other restaurants which offer a great view with great food and great service without apologies and excuses.",

The manager apologized and gave us a $25 gift card, which was very nice. However, that was the end of good service. It took a while to get drinks, even after asking only a few of us had our water refilled. It took a long time for our waiter to take our order. He came back 1/2 hour later to say that one person's appetizer was no longer available. We had to ask twice for bread. There were eight of us. After nearly two hours they brought only 3 salads, one of which was wrong and 3 entrees. Even after the manager was politely approached and apologized we didn't get all of the meals or salads. It was the worst restaurant experience we have ever had.",

The food, view and service was fantastic. My only negative was the awful music blaring in the background-it was thump thump thump of the bass to songs like Katy Perry's \"Eye of the Tiger\" which really destroys the ambience of fine dining. They should just turn it off because the incredible view and delicious food certainly provide enough ambience.",

Staff kept walking past our table carrying big trays of dishes, spraying and wiping down mirrors, ripping up paper for the tables and setting up. It was loud and distracting and unprofessional for a restaurant with such over-priced food and unfriendly service.  The host sitting outside showed us the lunch menu when we went in at 3:30 (lunch ends at 3). One of our group members asked for a burger but they denied making us one while the table next to us just got their burgers. Our waitress kept repeating that the kitchen is small and they put things for the lunch menu away and can't bring them out. I mean how hard is it to grab some ground meat and whip up a burger?? Especially since they just made one for someone else? And it probably isn't her fault cause she spoke to the kitchen and the manager and they said no. You really should be kinder and more considerate of your guests in such a touristic location.  The food was acceptable but I found a shrimp tail in my chicken parmesan.   It was also freezing and I had to ask our waitress to turn their AC down a bit.   They also added gratuity to our bill, which was offensive after such bad service (aren't you supposed to add it for tables of 6 or larger?).   After all this, I will give one star for the nice view of the city from the dining area. As their real estate agent was the only person who had done their work properly, our tip should go to him.",

The food was mediocre at best, a bit cold as if they heated it up (but not well enough). We ordered the eggplant rollatini and the hummus platter for appetizers. Skip the rollatini (cold, not fresh) but the hummus platter was very good. The parmesan chicken was decent- a large portion definitely enough to share. The service was fine but the waitstaff seemed to have beef with each other which was a bit awkward. The lighting kept going in and out so most of the time it was very dark- perhaps just a kink that the new restaurant needs to work out. Overall, the view was amazing but the food, service and ambiance were subpar.",

First of all, we choose this place for the view, so unable to be provide a window seat is definitely a bummer, especially when we reserved a window seat but didn't get it. We reserved on their website and requested a window seat, but when we got there, we've been told that we can't have a window seat.  Then we get to sit in front of a very dirty mirror, which was disgusting to look at.  For the food, we didn't have much expectations. Still it is surprisingly bad. The steak and salmon wasn't fresh, and both over-cooked. Even the signature cake \"Death by chocolate\" was just an ordinary chocolate cake, I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory. And the price was 87 dollars for 2.  Moreover, the service was below average. Servers barely asked if we need anything. And we waited 20 minutes for the check.  Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. Won't go again and won't recommend anyone to go.",

Served in a spicy sauce with sausage and lots of peppers-ask for a spoon because you're not going to want to waste this.  My boyfriend and I split the seafood trio pasta and the hangar steak. I especially enjoyed the garlic cream sauce and papardelle noodles with the pasta. We enjoyed the strawberry creme brulee (which was just right-not too sweet) and the caramel cheesecake.

Four of us ordered salads (which are 8 bucks each al la cart) and they didn't come until AFTER our entrees were served. I swear 4 employees kept apologizing about how late the salads were, which is nice, but damn just go get my salad!!! Finally the meals came and everyone really liked their food, but the portions were SO small. Not one of us had anything left over and some of us were still hungry! The staff kept apologizing over and over to the point where it became funny. On a positive note, they took the salads off the bill and even gave us some free deserts! It's a shame that I will never return, because all the food was really good!! Vue 412, seriously... get it together!!!",

I couldn't  decide if I wanted lobster or scallops. Why choose?? I ordered the lobster mac, add stuffed lobster tail, add two scallops. My boyfriend ordered surff and turf. The food arrived in a timely maner. My heart melted a little when these giant sized plates showed up at our table. The mac and cheese was surprisingly light and creamy. The stuffed lobster tail was mouth watering perfection. Not to mention the giant sized perfectly pan-seared scallops with just the right amount of sea salt. The surf and turf looked just as good. I am not a huge steak fan but this steak melted in your mouth like ice cream and on a hott day. The food was beyond my expectations, the service was above average and the view was made for a cheesy romantic comedy. All tho the bill was in the 3 digit range it was worth every single penny. I wood highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Vue 412. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a very nice host. He was extremely friendly and I love that kind of service. Our waiter and waitress were both very nice as well! A welcoming environment is always a plus when eating out!   As a whole, I have to be honest . . . Vue 412 was a miss for me. My family and I ate an early dinner (about 5pm) and the dining room was full of commotion while we were seated with employees prepping for the evening service. That should've happened earlier in the day - not after you open for dinner service. It was very bizarre. That kind host (was he the owner?) even had an altercation with an employee within earshot of our table . . .   Awkward.   Our waiter was very kind and then was absent for a long time and then we received a new waitress.   I still hope he's okay . . .   The food was really just okay. I'm glad the price-point wasn't any higher, but my meal was a $15 plate at best - not the $25 I paid (veal piccata). I tasted a bite of my wife's meal (salmon) and it really tasted good! The desserts were also very tasty and veryyy nicely presented!   We were in there for close to 2 hrs. Everything. Took. For. Ev. E. R.   The view was incredible and why the restaurant got 3 stars instead of 2! The inside decor, however, is a bit strange. It has a hint of fine dining with butcher paper on the tables...it just doesn't quite fit. Visual esthetic in a restaurant is something very important to me when dining out, and I really thought on more than a handful of occasions that Vue is a bit of a missed opportunity.   I see Vue as a place with a ton of potential! They have the location, which is more than 3/4 the battle (location, location, locat...). Nail the decor, button up the professionalism in the dining room, develop a more cohesive menu, quicken the service . . . You'll compete with the best of them and make a killing doing it. I want that for these guys because they're really nice!",

I had made a reservation a week prior and let them know we would be celebrating his birthday.   When we arrived, our table was ready for us, nicely seated on the second floor next to the window. Our server Sabrina happily greeted us and started us off with bread. We placed drink orders. I had a glass of wine and my boyfriend had a signature fall cocktail. Sabrina took her time making the drink perfectly! As we browsing the menu, the manager Joe came over to chat with us. Joe was so awesome to talk to. He really seemed to be genuinely interested in the guests that came to his restaurant. We also were able to get to know him and his experience working at Vue412 just by chatting with him, not to mention he was funny and gave great free compliments! Joe made sure to let everyone in the restaurant know it was my boyfriend's birthday and made sure that the food and service was exceptional.  Our appetizers: Bada Bing Shrimp & Greens & Beans  Our Meals: Tortelacci & Parmesean Chicken AMAZING! The portions were plenty and the flavors were delicious! I actually couldn't finish the Greens & Beans because I wanted to have room for my entre. I had plenty of leftovers to take for lunch the next day. The Gnocci served with my Parmeasean Chicken was cooked perfectly. With every bite, everything was more delicious.   After our food, Sabrina and the staff sang happy birthday with a cotton candy sparkler glass & complimentary lemon drop shots. She also cut the cake I had brought along. As if she hadn't done enough already, Sabrina went out of her way to unlock the upstairs patio to make sure my boyfriend and I could get a picture with the best view in the house. She took multiple photos and really made us feel like celebrities!  My boyfriend said he couldn't have asked for a more perfect night. Of course we came for the view, and the food was sensational.  (Currently craving more Greens & Beans! MMMMM!) But we will definitely be returning soon because of the overall experience we had with the staff at Vue412. Thank you for making it a night to remember!",

We were seated at a window table in the downstairs area, which would have had a great view of the city but the windows were very dirty.  The service was so so, mostly because there was only in waiter for the entire downstairs.  He was working hard but it was too much.  For example, we only received bread mid-meal after we noticed another table had it and asked.  The entrees were actually outstanding, highly recommend the short rib.  The atmosphere was ok, the local evening news was on the tv, the bar was half full and the downstairs was pretty dated.  If we go again, we'd request the main level as it seemed more up to date.",

It was fairly later in the evening after being really busy in the late afternoon when we called to see if we could make reservations. We walked right in and we were seated quickly right after the long bout of trying to find a parking spot; but you know men - they will find a spot no matter how long it takes. (Lol) There were no other people in the place. I enjoy getting dressed up and going to eat, but this night was a little more exciting when we had a spectacular view; wonder where they got the name? I thought the place was bigger because there were mirrors everywhere, but when we left - I realized it was pretty small. Unless there was another floor that I missed. I think that there were a good many options for dinner but I was really craving Italian. I went with the veal Parmesan which I've been without for a long time. Kind of disheartening to see other reviews that had a bad time because I really liked this place. Our waitress was super nice and did everything correctly. It was not a long wait for food, the appetizer was just enough along with the bread and olive oil that was served. My veal was really good. The dessert was a lemon cake and it was seriously so good. I was happy with all the selections. It's really close to Mt. Washington park/look out area with the skyline view which we would've spent more time at but it was literally freezing. Luckily, I was warmed up by my hand being held.",

Service was bland. We had to ask for bread service...to which we were given a mediocre answer along the lines of \"I think there is bread somewhere or it's baking.\" I was a server for 9 years. Just be honest and say you forgot it. My boyfriend and I had the entire downstairs to ourselves on a Tuesday night and it was super intimate and romantic. Definitely go during the week for dinner if you want a \"on the edge of the world just you two\" experience. Only thing that cut through, was this server (not ours) loudly complaining on and on about how slow it is and she doesn't even make minimum wage. And how there's nobody here. Cool I get it- just complain not in the ear shot of the only two paying people in the restaurant? And if you don't like your job, don't work there. It's Mt Washington and there's plenty of restaurants! We got a decent chuckle out of it but I promise, anyone else older than us would not have been pleased. For the price point, the service should have been a little better. The ambience was beautiful and we loved everything. I had the Spanish white wine as well and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken parm and it was phenomenal. We'll definitely be back! Just some little things as food for thought!",

I was called the day of to confirm my reservation, which I appreciated. We got to the restaurant on the top of Mount Washington, and there was limited parking, but we actually were able to park in the nearby neighborhood for free (VERY LIMITED). We came on a Saturday night at 7:00pm so that we could see the city during the day, as the sun set, and with the city lights. We were immediately seated at a window table with a beautiful view. Dress is business casual, at the least. The restaurant has some seating that is not windowside as well, but window tables were on a reservation or on a first come, first serve basis. Our waitress (female with dark hair) was extremely attentive and the food came out quickly. My boyfriend started with a Fall Fashioned cocktail and I had a water. We ordered mussels, which were delicious. As soon as we were finished, we got our entrees- salad with grilled shrimp and gnocchi with sausage. We also got strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Because I notified the restaurant that it was his birthday, he got cotton candy in a wine glass with sparklers and was sung happy birthday. This helped make this a wonderful birthday for him. The entire dinner meal was fabulous and I would give it a solid 4 stars. But, the overall restaurant definitely gets all 5 stars for wonderful food, great atmosphere, and wonderful service. We were overall very pleased with our experience and I highly recommend it here!",

We so enjoyed the restaurant on Saturday that we came back again on Sunday!!!. You will want to try the mussels, and the shrimp appetizer and the tiramisu was one of the best we've had, ever. Thank you Joe Dana and Chris for making this weekend one of the best we've had in some time, and we look forward to returning to your awesome restaurant on our next trip back into your beautiful city!",

We did get a table by the window so maybe that was because of the special occasion. My dinner which happened to be the special was great. Blackened halibut over lobster ravioli. My wife got the lobster tails. One was ok but the other was chewy and seemed under cooked. I should have notified our waiter but I didn't. My fault and I regret it now. We wii try a different restaurant next time we're in town.",

I think the Parpadelle is not to be missed. It's a must. The shrimp was grilled perfectly for my salad. Only New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc for our table and we were indeed pleasantly surprised that they had it. Perfect lunch. More than drop dead panoramic view of how the the Allegheny and Monaghahelia (forgive me) Rivers merge into the Ohio.... priceless view. Precious Owner. Amazing Chef! We were so pleased. Glad to be visiting this lovely town. Thank you Joe (and Nathan).",

Noisy, annoying, careless staff... waitress dropped a fork in my lap while clearing a plate and just giggled.  Both desserts were quite good and great view.  Overall very disappointing",

There were several other restaurants on the same block, but this spot seemed particularly modern and hip for the old and antiquated area. The view is breathtaking and definitely a great location for a romantic dinner. It was also very small and calm as well which also adds to the romantic dinner spot. We sat at the bar which was ran by a very friendly and sweet bartender (I didn't catch her name) but she definitely made us feel welcome and comfortable even though we were just passing through for a drink. They have a nice selection of wines and beers as well.",

The prices are very reasonable for the area and location compared to others on mt Washington.  I really enjoyed the manager greeting the table and getting to know you like it was a mom and pop establishment where they value the patrons who visited.  If looking for parking there is a parking garage or if can find street parking which maybe a walk for you.  I suggest taxi, Uber, or Lyft.  If near the Duquesne incline, it's only a few store front down from it.  The management staff is very accommodating as we are planning an event in the future and they provided different options as which of the three floors we wanted, if wanted to use their third floor which is for private parties and they can do a buffet or do full or partial menu.  Definitely a place we are going to visit again.",

Order a bottle of wine, after 15 minutes asked our waitress about our wine.  The bartender was busy with 10 ladies at the bar, we were told.  Well why not get the manager to get our bottle requested?  When the wine came server poured way to much in our glasses.  Obviously server training needed. Started with the Bada Bing Shrimp,  a spicy sauce was OK but not anything special.  I had the Osso Bucco.... Very good! Waited for our salads, which are huge, wondering why other tables had bread & oil with sun dried tomato & tapenade but we did not.  Well it did come with the salad but others received it with app.  Not sure when it should have come but servers are not consistent or others requested it early. With our salad was OK by me. Did I mention the Osso Bucco was really good!  Had a bite of salmon & it was good too.   We had a nice diner with a great view.  Probably a 3.5 diner due to my Osso Bucco!",

While visiting family for Christmas from the Washington DC area, we wanted to experience dinner in Pittsburgh and enjoy the city views from Mt. Washington. We were not disappointed and got some great pictures. The wait staff were attentive, and even took some great shots for us! Dana our waitress was great. A few things were a little \"off\" however!       We had a party of 9, but a small plate of bread with maybe 5 small pieces  was brought out. They said more world come out in a little whine since it was still warming in the oven.. 10 minutes later we received 2 more small plates. The white table cloths were covered with brown paper! I felt like I was eating at a crab house  back on Maryland!! The calamari and bada  bing shrimp were fantastic, but the meatballs with ricotta , which took longer to come to the table were cold!  The Chicken Romano and Lobster mac and cheese were great, as well as the chicken with artichokes and capers and the cod fish special , but the gnocchi  dish was mushy and filled with too much garlic. My  nephew could not even eat it! My mother ordered the Prime Rib which was served grilled and dry with no au jus which I thought was strange. The baked potatoes were served cold. They were happy to warm them but when they brought them back they were still cold. One other thing, the meals did not come out at the same time, so we all had to wait politely until all of the meals were served.    They took the Prime Rib off of our bill and offered two complimentary desserts to make up for the cold potatoes which was a nice gesture.  All in all we enjoyed our family meal together, but would probably try some place different next time we dine on Mt. Washington!!",

Sat at the bar in the basement and was immediately greeted by the bartender cussing out the previous bartender for leaving such a mess. Turns out the old bartender was moving to be a server and the two of them continued arguing right in front of us. How unprofessional. A glass was broken behind the bar and they continued the sarcasm and arguing before finally cleaning it up. Bartender didn't have a clue what an IPA was and kept calling it a pilsner. To top it all off, we overheard the manager saying to the staff that they were cancelling happy hour that night since they were too busy and unprepared. I've never heard of a restaurant doing such a thing. The drinks were good but the service, or lack there of, was atrocious. We will never be back for this reason.

    "text": "I'm going to write a thorough review of this one... Because if you are like me and considering the comments and ratings for Vue 412, and weighing the 4 star overall rating against some of the negative reviews, and on the fence about trying it out, this is for you. Plus, the manager replies to reviews on here and seems genuinely interested in improving his restaurant, so perhaps this will help him too. My husband wanted me to cancel our reservation after reading the reviews, but I convinced him to give it a try. I knew I was going to be in BIG trouble if this didn't go well;)  I booked through Open Table and requested a window table, explaining this was my first time on Mt. Washington and the whole reason we chose this restaurant. I called to inquire about parking on our way there. The hostess that answered the phone needs to work on her presentation. She was not rude, but she definitely does not have the kind of demeanor you want making the first impression for the restaurant. She informed me there was a parking lot across the street, but did not mention it cost $10. No other parking options were given. No thanks for choosing us, no see you soon, no thanks for calling, no is there anything else I can help you with (which is phone service 101). Given the fact that View 412 takes some pretty hard hits for service in the reviews, she needs to step it up big time. She must not have checked us in via open table because we did not get our points:(  We arrived, \"greeted\" by the same hostess from the phone. No smiles, no welcome to Vue 412. I'm pretty sure she just looked at us until we spoke first. We were seated right away, not at a window table as requested and given 2 menus for a party of 4.  Then, our server Jennifer greeted us. Super nice, knowledgeable about the menu and specials, helpful, attentive, on time. She provided great service throughout and we were there for about 3 hours (by choice).   I had the halibut special (served over Parmesan risotto). My husband and the other gentleman with us both had scallops, and his wife had shrimp scampi. We also had the shrimp appetizer. Dessert was creme brulee and lemon mascarpone cake. Every single item was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. I'm extremely picky about seafood, much more so than anyone I know.... And it was all very impressive, fresh, presented well, seasoned or seared perfectly, etc.  I think the 4 out of 5 stars is an accurate rating because there are obviously a few minor kinks that need to be worked out here. Once that happens, this is easily going to be a 5 star restaurant. These kinks I am referring to are: -the hostess needs to go or be held to a higher standard of service. She is the first impression and not delivering. Everyone else there seems to be working so hard to do a great job, she is not doing her part and is letting the team down. -We were informed by Jennifer that there currently is no drink menu because it is being revamped. I'm a person that needs a drink menu if I'm not ordering beer or wine. I told her to just have the bartender make me something sweet, but not overly sweet and with ginger...any kind of liquor is ok. I was brought what seemed to be an adult version of a Shirley Temple. It was not good at all. I should have sent it back, but I did not, nor did I complain about it. But, I did switch to a Reisling that was fantastic. -The other issue we noticed, is that whoever is doing the ordering hasn't quite figured out how to meet the demand yet. They were out of a lot of items (greens and beans appetizer, grey goose, one of the red wines, etc). In fact, they even ran out of dinner menus and our party of 4 had to share 2, which was no big deal to us. However, there were a few open tables and it could have been an issue if the 6 top beside us got seated and there were zero menus to present them with. -The atmosphere could easily be amped up a bit. With a location and set up like that, I would definitely go for a more trendy vibe, but it kind of felt retro to me.  A summary of the MANY positives...the view is AMAZING from any table. The food was OUTSTANDING. The service (excluding the hostess) was IMPECCABLE.   On the service, since that is the category most criticized (referring to everyone except the hostess)....Not only was our server, Jennifer, fantastic, but we must have had 2 or 3 other employees refill water and deliver food. All were very pleasant. One man, possibly the manager, was at our table twice and inquired about our satisfaction both times. When we were on the sidewalk exiting, one of the kitchen employees happened to be out there and saw our friend drop her after dinner mint, he ran back inside and brought her a handful.   Sorry for the really long review, I rely heavily on reviews so always do my part. I don't want anyone missing out on this great place because of a couple of negative reviews",

The ambiance was great and the staff was friendly.  Patrick was an excellent server! The owner also said hello which was a nice touch.  We loved the food.  My fiance upgraded to filet and crab cakes which were great and I was pleased with the seafood trio.  Big shrimp & scallops- well worth the $$.

The service was great as well! 8:30 reservation with a window seat and they definitely captured the mood of romance I was going for! It made our night!  I'm so glad I chose this place over Altius because we had our own table for two and we were able to have privacy from other customers. I didn't want to leave cuz I was so enchanted with the setting and the food! The Valentine's menu was wonderful as well !! I'd definitely go back! We came from out of town and I had planned that reservation blindly and I definitely made the right choice! Thank you VUE 412! We had the best Valentine's Day! I wish I remembered our servers name, he's a bartender there too and he was fabulous!!! Just FABULOUS! I'm a server too so I'm very judgmental with other ones lol lol! But he made our night there even better! He even made us a list of other Pittsburgh activities going on. We loved him! And we loved Vue 412!!",

The food - crab cakes and scallops - was very good, but the overall experience was lack luster. We made reservations months in advance, requesting window seats, which was not honored. I understand they can't make such a guarantee, but when we later saw the hostess sitting down at a table of 6 by the windows to watch the fireworks, we were not thrilled. We kept having to remind the server that we had ordered another drink or to bring the bread and oil. They were also out of several menu drink and food items, advising their deliveries didn't arrive as anticipated.",

We both opted for a seafood dish that had shrimp, scallops, and lump crab and were not disappointed. Service was good and Steve, the bar manager, was great. We sat downstairs where the bar is, which provided a relaxing and casual atmosphere; a little less formal than the main dining room, which we liked. Would recommend and do plan to return.",

    "text": "I give it two stars for the view but I can pay $2.50, take the incline, and have an even better view. When reviewing a nice restaurant, I evaluate on 3 things - ambiance, service, and of course food/drink. The ambiance was not what I was expecting, the restaurant didn't seem to have air conditioning and on a 90 degree day, it was getting really toasty in there. Additionally, it was really dated and for being under the impression that the restaurant had recently opened, it was lacking heavily in this area. As for the service, it felt almost nonexistent beyond the lovely hostess who was nice. The waitress didn't introduce herself, didn't go over the menu, etc. All things I would expect when paying $20+ for a small piece of salmon. Weirdly enough, our waitress was LOVELY to the table right next to us (an older couple), so it really felt like it came down to her assuming who would tip better - her loss. And finally, the most important thing - food & drinks. I can withstand bad service if you are going to provide me with an exceptional culinary experience. We ordered the hummus as a starter, which flavor wise was fine, but the way that it had been prepared made it pretty dry when it got to the table. I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the bolognese. I ate some of both and both were lackluster. The salmon was fishy and overcooked, you can only say \"blackened\" when applying seasoning, not when you are pan searing it to the point of dehydrating the fish. The bolognese was too sweet and too watery. Bolognese is a robust, meaty and heavy sauce, if it looks more like soup - that's an issue and means it's not being prepared properly. Additionally, we got the chocolate cake to share and it tasted like an overly iced store bought cake. So overall, for the hype and excitement about this establishment, I would recommend finding a different restaurant if you actually are looking for a good food experience.",

    "text": "Tonight was fancy date night for J and I, so we picked Vue 412 since we've heard positive reviews. Man...were we wrong. First the good things: the view at Vue was great. And, that's about it. Everything else was mediocre to downright awful. Our waitress Lorraine from the UK was terrible. Initially, we took pity on her thinking that she was new and forgetful, however we later found out (from the manager) that she's \"ditzy\". We ordered the charcuterie to start. Unimpressive. The bread was hard...not crispy...hard. One of the meats had a peppermint aftertaste, which made J sick. I ordered a glass of Riesling and was told that I couldn't have that because it was not placed in the fridge like all of the other wines. Huh?!?! I got a Moscato instead. J asked for anything non-alcoholic and was told that they could give him sparkling water, but that was it. What?!?! No sodas?? Then came our entrees. J ordered the fettuccini broccoli and chicken Alfredo, and I ordered the salmon. My salmon came with asparagus, rather than spinach as the menu said, and I did not have fig and Gorgonzola cheese pasta as promised. J's Alfredo pasta was TERRIBLE.  The sauce was oily and running everywhere, not creamy as one would think. Instead of fettuccini noddles, he was given meat filled ravioli, the chicken was dry and burnt, and the entire dish tasted bland. When we expressed our displeasure with Lorraine, she responded \"I don't know what the chef is doing up there. Maybe he's sleeping. Or maybe he's high. I don't know\" What?!?! You should NEVER say that. Since J didn't touch his food, we asked for it to be taken off the bill. Lorraine told us that since he had a little bit, they were not going to do that. We asked who she spoke with and she said that there was no manager present. During dinner?!?! So we asked for the check, paid $100 and got up to leave. The hostess asked how our meal was, and when we told of our experience, she immediately rolled her eyes, said \"Oh Lorraine\" and went to get a manager. We spoke with the manager and he refunded J's meal. Needless to say, we are never going back there again.",

    "text": "I booked this restaurant in January for my sons rehersal dinner. We made our plans for food tasting with JJ. Our appointment was for late May as the dinner for 20 is in July. Very sadly, my husband passed away in early May. As we went to our scheduled food tasting, we called as we were going to be a few minutes late. We were informed, quite rudely, that our reservation for 20 was lost and that they had no tasting scheduled. We were upset , but since we were almost there, we went anyway. We met with Dan, who pretended to be a manager and we spent 2 hours with him selecting food with his promises we are all set nothing to worry about. I never heard from him again and when I called the restaurant, they say they lost our reservation again. And Dan was not a manager, but a server, and was fired. I then speak to Melissa who told me she has been there for years and she promises it will be a beautiful event. I take an hour and go over everything again. I never hear from her again. I call the restaurant and find out that she resigned two weeks later. Then in 1 summer, 4 managers later, I get the owner Rose. Who also says they lost our reservation.  This was extremely stressful to say the least and I tell her the whole story, including losing my beloved husband  right before our sons wedding.  She is stone cold and says \" I have problems too\" WOW. DO NOT DO NOT plan an event here.  These people are cold, heartless,  disorganized and DO NOT care about their customers. We are going to another restaurant and the new place was kind enough to help us a few weeks before the event. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM VUE 412.",

    "text": "I made a reservation to Vue 412 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We are new to Pittsburgh and I surprised him with some family that came in town and a ride up the Duquesne Incline topped off with dinner at Vue 412. In preparation I called to reserve a window table and to have a printed custom message on our menus (the hostess happily confirmed on the phone). Needless to say I was extremely disappointed that, upon arrival (10 mins early), there was not a reserved window seat AND there were no printed menus because \"they've been busy and didn't have time\" (per the hostess). Mind you, I only received explanation after being seated and asking her. I wanted the night to be special so I didn't make a fuss. On to the next, except no so easy, no drinks after 10 minutes so the hostess brings us water. 15 more minutes and our waiter shows up to take drink and appetizer orders. A couple wrong drinks (sigh) and one wrong appetizer (grrr). At this point everyone at my table is a bit on edge - and unfortunately this was my \"fine dining\" plan for my boyfriend's birthday. Okay, okay, on to dinner - we finally receive dinner (one bottle of wine is topped during this wait). THE BIRTHDAY GUY's steak is not what he ordered!!!! Can I also mention the steak brought to his was a NY Strip and cooked to \"chef's temp\" which was well done. OMG what chef anywhere recommends well done?! I digress. Around this point the server tells us how hard fine dining is and we all discuss how loosely the term fine dining is used here. So that's our story - the service is terrible (servers and hostess are not very attentive), and even if your server writes everything down you may not get what you ordered. If you're cool with that, the food is decent and there is definitely a nice \"vue\". If service matters, this may not be the place for you. There was one staff member (not our server or the hostess) who regularly refilled our drinks - he was awesome!",

    "text": "Vue 412 is a welcome addition to Mt. Washington. It has of course a wonderful view of the city. The menu is very creative and wide ranging. Lunch selections went from mussels to  good looking burgers. And the waitstaff was \"Pittsburgh\" friendly. The price point was very reasonable for the quality of the food. Will return soon to have dinner. It is worth the trip up the mount!",

    "text": "I had a bad feeling about this the moment we sat down.  We went to Vue412 for lunch this past Saturday.  We had reserved a table for 12.  None of us had ever eaten at this restaurant, so I checked out their menu offerings online a day or so prior.  They actually had a few menus listed on their website.  A standard dinner offering (which also included sandwiches that had been listed as \"lunch only\"), a Friday-Sunday lunch menu and a couple of banquet menus.  So, of course, I was expecting to be presented with the weekend lunch menu as advertised...  As we were seated, we were presented with the standard dinner menu (full priced entrees, of course) instead of the more reasonably appointed lunch selections.    Well, no problem, as the dinner menu did include a selection of lunch sandwiches (see above)...  The waitress greeted us and then proceeded to explain that all of the dinner selections from the menu were available to order, but that the sandwiches on the menu were not available for this particular lunch...  She then proceeded to describe an alternate stable of sandwiches that were being prepared for the day.  So, the present menu was rendered rather useless unless we really were set on the $38 Filet for our quaint luncheon.  I will expand on the quality and value of the food momentarily.  The next item I need to take issue with was the general knowledge of the wait staff.  Let me first preface this by saying that our waitress was very polite and even patient with our larger party.  She even went the extra step to bring some extra fries out to the kids at the table and was kind enough to accommodate one of our more picky youngsters.  This was the key aspect which earned star #2 of my review.  But.... Every time we asked a question regarding an item on, or in most cases NOT on the menu, we were presented with an \"I'm not sure, let me check with the kitchen.\"  Now, I'm nothing if not realistic, and I realize that this is not out of the ordinary, but it seemed that most every question no matter how simple (\"Do you have American cheese?\") was responded to in this manner.  Also, through the meal, it felt almost as if she was overwhelmingly busy with tables even though we were the only party in this section of the restaurant.  The food quality was above average.  I could tell that the ingredients to each of the items ordered were carefully selected and of high quality.  But, again, I do feel that dinner pricing for lunch fare is a bit egregious.  I ordered a steak sandwich (again, not on any of the advertised menus), and they must have known that I am trying to really watch my caloric intake as it included about 2oz. of the steak trimmings from their butchered entree cuts.  Again, I'm realistic, its a fancy restaurant, I wasn't expecting the Jumbo Special from Uncle Sam's (awesome steak sandwiches).  Now, my wife decided to try the Mediterranean Salad: celery, cucumber, chickpeas, pepperoncini, black olives, grape tomatoes, feta, grilled flatbread and an oregano vinaigrette (actual menu description).  The presentation of the salad was very pleasing.  A large bed of greens with some flatbread wedges nested on top (one of which fell to the ground as the waitress was serving it.  Not replaced, but I digress).  As she dug into the salad, she concluded that substance did not hold priority to presentation.  3 black olives, 3 grape tomatoes (halved so that there was an illusion of 6), and the bare minimum of feta cheese allowable with still being able to claimed feta cheese on the menu description.  Now today's economy has been tough, and I am sure they are simply trying to control costs, but for $18, I would assume that a few extra olives from the can and another tablespoon or two of feta cheese wouldn't cut too deeply into the profit margin of this item.  But, hey, everything was tasty.  One of the other diners ordered the steak salad, and we were notified that they were out of mesculn, but could substitute spinach or romaine... at 1:30 on a Saturday... tough luck, eh dinner crowd?  Although I did not partake, I am told that the desserts were fantastic...  Sufficed to say, I did not feel that we really got much bang for our buck on this outing.  Who knows, maybe I am just revealing myself as an uncivilized, low cultured simpleton.  But, I do know that I will most likely not be making a return trip to this establishment.  The view was great, but I feel that it has been way overvalued in the experience.  The hiccups in the logistics of the menu and the service could certainly be attributed to growing pains, but for these prices, there is not much margin for these types of issues.  I read a previous review about a similar experience on New Year's.  It would seem that busy or slow, this place has some wrinkles to iron out.  At these prices, one would be much better served to head to the Lemont, Monterey Bay or one of the other fine dining establishments on Mt. Washington.",
