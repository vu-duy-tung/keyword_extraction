    "text": "My husband and I tried Mercurio's for the first time tonight for a light dinner before happy hour at another restaurant in Shadyside. The restaurant was pretty quiet - even for a weekday (Thursday) night - with only about 10-12 customers in the restaurant throughout our dinner.  Our waitress Ivy quickly greeted us when we came into the restaurant. She was attentive throughout our meal, bringing my husband a couple drink refills and checking on us several times. All the pizzas on the menu looked tasty, and we asked Ivy for recommendations. She listed four of her favorites, most highly recommending the Bianco (garlic, basil, parmigiano reggiano) and the Pizza Del Re (truffle spread, mushrooms, and prosciutto). The Pizza Del Re looked like the more unique option, so we decided to split that.  The pizza was a unique and delicious combination of toppings. The $6-16 price point for the various pizzas is very reasonable for both the restaurant's Shadyside location and the quality of food delivered. The size of the pizza is either sharing size for a light dinner or will probably require a takeout box if just ordered by one. The wait was about 15 minutes for our pizza. Though the wait time was very reasonable, I would be concerned about how long the wait would be if the restaurant was packed.  Though we just tried pizza tonight, walking by the gelato was nearly resistible. The flavors were extensive and looked absolutely delicious. I came so close to ordering some, but then thought it best to wait until next time since I was heading to happy hour. Cannot wait to come back and try the gelato in the future... it looks no less than heavenly!",

The menu is perfectly sized, with plenty of options but not at all overwhelming. Simple, straightforward food--antipasti, salads, pizza, some pasta. I'd like to return for dinner too because their wine list looks great, and you can get many wines by the half carafe. We ordered the rustico salad with prosciutto, artichokes, olives and cherry tomatoes, which was light and simple. It was served with delicious grilled bread and just the right amount of balsamic. We then shared the Pizza Del Re. If you're a fan of truffles, this is divine! It has baby bellas, mozzarella, prosciutto and truffle spread. The crust was soft yet thin, and was cooked perfectly.  Of course we had to try the gelato as well, which was good but hard to live up to the deliciousness of the pizza. We will certainly be returning soon!",

The atmosphere is authentic, and the brick oven from Naples makes it even cooler.   For Restaurant Week, the offer was a salad, pizza, and gelato for $14.01. Very tasty. The serving of salad was huge and a lot more than we expected. It was fresh, too. The pizza was great, too, and a large serving. Even though it didn't have as much cheese as I would have hoped, it was definitely cooked perfectly in the brick oven. The gelato choices are awesome, and being dessert, it was obviously the best part. I only wish the scoop of gelato would've been a little bigger.  I would recommend this place, especially because of the prices and service. Walnut Street needed a nice addition like this, and it really fits in perfectly for the area that it's in.",

    "text": "A few months back my mom and I were in Shadyside and happened to see all the people outside eating pizzas. A few months later I suggested her and I go and give it a whirl. It was around 7:30 pm when we arrived and for us that is pretty late to be eating dinner. I definitely thought this place wouldn't be as crowded, but news flash to us.... it was packed. When I opened the door all I could see was a line of people waiting to get gelato, so my first instinct was go in the back where the brick oven is and get out of this mess. Once we found a table we were stopped and asked if we seen the hostess. All I could see was a  lot people in line for a cold treat, not a hostess stand. It's a pretty narrow setup inside and I can't say I felt to comfortable from the get go.   I ended up getting a Margherita pizza and my mom ordered the Melanzana panini which came with eggplant, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, tomato sauce and ricotta cheese. We both ordered our meals at the same time and she ended up getting her meal 15 minutes before me and by the time mine got there, she was done eating. If you know there is a backlog on pizzas then my moms meal shouldn't have been placed when mine was and maybe they could have came out together. When my pizza did finally make it to my table, I wasn't very impressed with the taste. Nothing about it stood out to me and I've had better experiences with other wood fired pizza joints in town.   With the way dinner went, I was pretty antsy to get out of there. But I figured I should probably try the gelato. Yet another painful experience. It would have been nice to see a list of flavors up on the wall behind the coolers. There was still a large number of people in line and they were standing so close to the glass it was tough to see the flavors; and there is a lot of flavors to be acknowledged! I was really hoping for a better experience than the one my mom and I had. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.",

The house salad is unexpectedly good--if you don't think it's possible to feel enthusiastic about a salad, try this one.   For the pizzas, I'm particularly fond of the pizza del re--the delicate truffle flavor is so lovely. The margherita is straightforward and classic but very satisfying and balanced in flavor.  The gelatos are beautifully creamy and they have a really excellent flavor range and generous portion sizes. Highly recommend the fior di latte, nutella, and the dark chocolate cherry. Haven't tried all the flavors BUT I AM WORKING ON IT and I am very dedicated to the tasting cause, I assure you.  Service is always super efficient and friendly. I'm a bit worried I sound like a shill now, but Mercurio's is seriously very good and one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh.",

We ordered a Quattro Formaggi and  Margherita pies.  The only reason I give them four stars is because I'm not in love with the pizza but I am in love with the gelato.  Staff is generally friendly, super young but nice and professional.  They seem to enjoy working there.  Again, gelato is amazing.  This is my go-to for dessert.  I think there is better pizza in the city, Mercurio's pizzas are a little pricey (in my opinion) and I think you could get a better specialty pizza somewhere else in the city for the same price.",

Gelato is generally on the pricier side, so it's what you would expect (3.75 for a small). Though we didn't eat meals, the pizzas being taken to the tables around us all looked and smelled great. I liked the casual ambience at Mercurio's and will definitely return to try their food. Great location on Walnut.",

Aside from Stone downtown, this is my favorite Neapolitan pizza in this city. I also love that they have gelato because it's pretty hard finding gelato in Pittsburgh. To combine the two is a brilliant idea. When my husband and I came here, we ordered the caprese panini, margherita pizza and two gelatos. I don't remember what flavor gelato he got, but I ordered the dulce de leche. The panini and pie had fresh ingredients that were well balanced and not overpowering of any one ingredient and the gelato was rich, creamy and delicious as you would expect from gelato. The nice thing is you can come in here just for the gelato or just for the pizza or have both!",

The staff was very nice about sampling and I was able to make an educated decision with a small strawberry cheesecake. Had I properly read the sign, I would have noticed that I could put three flavors in a small, but you live and learn. After careful deliberation I selected the strawberry cheesecake and it was totally enjoyable as a solo flavor. It was creamy, refreshing and embodied the gelato version of a strawberry cheesecake. I almost went back for another round of gelato but logic kicked in and I resisted.   My small was less than $3 which I found to be very reasonable.   Excellent gelato. Excellent variety. Excellent prices.",

We were served by an efficient waitress, who made sure we had a great lunch experience. It would have been a 5 star review, except for the dead flies on the windowsill... All 4 of them.  It really was a shame - we had heard so many great things about this place - my mouth salivated when good amigos presented their plea.... We ordered simply  - two pizzas - a Margherita and a mushroom pizza.  I will also add that these pizzas were tasty and clean, but were not of the quality that you would get at several other close-by establishments - Piccolo Forno (5-star) and Dinette (5-star). Now, the price point is very much different between all three restaurants, but I absolutely KNOW that this place can achieve more with some oversight and guidance... The brick oven can be used for much more quality, rather than volume.  Will definitely be back - I want to see if this place will up the game!",

They have traditional flat bread Italian pizzas that are personal sized and when you first walk in there are an assorted flavors of gelato which is what I came for. They let you sample the flavors first. I usually get death by chocolate but they ran out so I went with the European chocolate (which is a good replacement but not the same) and dulce de leche. I got the small cup which holds 2 to 4 oz and two flavors. It's about 76 cents and ounce and my total way $4 something which isn't bad at all. We got there around 945 which is close to closing (about an hour before closing). They were out of a lot of good flavors so I was bummed. I think they should have more of the flavors that are popular because some of their flavors weren't touched at all, and there was still a decent amount of people coming in for gelato.",

But now that I live in the South Hills I still make special trips to eat here. In fact, my parents, who are from out of tow, often request to go here when they are visiting.  Whether you go for the classic Margherita or for something more involved like the Capricciosa, you will not be disappointed. I love mushrooms, so my favorite is the funghi, but I try to get something new every time I go. If you're not feeling pizza, they also have delicious paninis. I recommend the caprese or italino.  Many people just go here for the gelato. And it's not wonder why. It's soooo much better than your typical ice cream. They have so many flavors to choose from that picking one is often overwhelming. I try to get something new every time I go.   While Mercurio's may look more like a counter-top service place, it double as a really nice sit-down restaurant. They even offer wine and beer on their menu. Be warned though, there aren't tons of tables, so you'll want to be prepared to wait. Luckily, they do have NoWait, so if the wait is long you can visit surrounding Walnut St. shops while you wait for them to text you your table is ready.   Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh!",

We ordered the half carafe of house wine along with a Fungui pizza to share. The pizza was perfectly cooked, nice and crispy and the toppings were just delicious and you could taste the freshness of the pizza. The crust was thin enough to hold all the topping without falling appart. You didn't even need additional mozzarella. Just awesome.

The pizzas are big enough to share with one other person and we shared the Robertos which had gooey burrata cheese on it with grape tomatoes and basil layered underneath. It was so good and the crust was so crispy and amazing. And once you've finished your meal you can pop right up and taste then order some gelato and add it to your tab. This place was great and the panzanella salad was so good too! If you're wanting pizza look no further than Mercurio's they have some of the best pizza and delicious gelato to top it off. I will say though that after tasting the cappuccino gelato shake, it was a lot more milk flavored than cappuccino but other than that no complaints from this party.",

I've searched and found some favorite restaurants over the years, but I'm pretty sure this place tops them all. I've raved about it so much that I think my fiance and I are going to plan a return trip to Pittsburgh (We live in Seattle!) just so he can try it! PS - order the buffalo mozzarella - It is better than I ever hoped to be able to find in the states! I just wish this pizza was available somewhere closer to home!

Wads and wads of cash that could have been used to help starving families in this country were squandered on a lackluster film whose Cheese Factor would have risen only if it were a musical. It was a lame duck. A pretty duck, but a lame one.  So quality doesn't always come at a cost, but it does at Mercurio's.  The flavor selection is off the charts, causing the brain to atrophy temporarily into indecision only to be kickstarted again by the sheer incomprehensibility of the situation.   Expect the following cycle: Caramel green apple? -- yum, I want... -- OMG, mulberry with chocolate chunks? Mmm -- No! I want blueberry muffin... -- Ack! Brain... dying... can't... -- ... -- ... -- ... -- Raspberry & truffles? -- yum, I want... -- OMG...  Every flavor I've had is heavenly, sending me into a Stratosphere of Happy for the next 60+ minutes.  The only downside is their absurd pay-by-the-ounce scheme, which is really a bid for more money. When faced with so much Deliciousness, are you really going to say, \"I only want $2 worth?\" No, probably not. And, really, $2 worth of this insanely lip-smacking gelato isn't enough. Hell, $20 worth wouldn't be enough.   So, Mercurio's: change the pricing, and I'm yours.   Forever.   I've already picked out your ring and the China pattern.",

I read from the other reviews about the discomfort in the store due to the lack of coolness or overabundance of warmth...I either didn't notice it or I was too busy with my eyes glazed over at all the flavors...it could be that once I order, I leave the store immediately, so warm or cold, doesn't affect my enjoyment of the deliciousness known as Mercurio's.",

Whenever I talk to friends from any of these cities, they always ask me about the cuisine, to which I say: Fries. Cold fries. Cold fries on your burger. Cold fries on your salad. None of my friends have come to visit.   But now I have something to entice them with. Mercurio's is AWESOME. I have eaten pizza straight out of an outdoor pizza oven in the middle of wine vineyard in Tuscany and the pizza at Mercurio's easily tastes as authentic. We also had an appetizer of olives and bread, a carafe of wine, and a gelato to top off the meal. Our entire bill was 40 bucks. Terrific food does not have to be expensive, and it also does not have to be topped with fries. Thank you Mercurio's!",

I discovered this fantastic little place this weekend (there is gelato that tastes like blueberry muffins; how did I not know of its existence until now!?) and spent a few glorious minutes eating some of the creamiest, yummiest concoction.  The best part here is the variety. Literally dozens of flavors to choose from. While standing in the line that was nearly out the door, I read a printout of yelp reviews--one of which suggested ordering a variety of flavors in one cup. Brilliant. I ordered half dark chocolate stracciatella and half strawberry cheesecake in one cup (ugly cups, sorry-- plain white would be classier! but how am I complaining when there is heaven. in my mouth.). The strawberry cheesecake won me over far more than the chocolate, but that's the beauty of ordering different flavors.  I officially have a new Saturday ritual in the form of gelato. I think I'll spend weekdays devising strategies for choosing gelato flavors only to order on a whim when the weekend arrives. Mercurio's Mulberry, you are my new obsession.",

The prosciutto and the truffle oil made it stand out though.  It was such a wonderful medley of flavor.  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars was the crust.

    "text": "This is probably my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood and favorite pizza place in the 'burgh. I love Neapolitan style and thin pizzas and this place totally delivers. In fact it's really the best Neapolitan I've ever had in the US. Not only that, they serve up an exceptional spread of gelati and sorbetto with seasonal flavors and in-house creations (they started as a gelato place, FYI).   My wife and I have gone once or twice a month since moving here in 2013. When it comes to pizza I enjoy simple: delicious crust, succulent NOT salty sauce, and toppings that complement the pizza not overpower it. Mercurio's delivers on ALL THREE with each pizza that I've tried, with the always recommended Margherita (our #1 pick) or the funghi to the more richly flavored meat-topped offerings like the Salciccia i Funghi, prosciutto, or the truly decadent Pizza del Re.   I highly recommend a house salad and splitting a pizza. You'll spend $15 to $20 and have a very good meal. Each bread this place makes is fantastic so if you need another flavor or just got tired of pizza (who does this?) then go for the eggplant or italiano or prosciutto paninis.   Now, the breakdown of what I love about each part of their pizza----  Crust: always fresh cooked and crisped to perfection in their inside wood oven, never once had a burnt or undercooked piece, slightly acidic dough (almost french baguette level of acidity) with a crispy outer crust and soft airy warm inside. To me this is the CORE of the pizza and I have YET to find a tastier crust anywhere.   Sauce: light tomatoe based red sauce, sweet and not heavily salted or herb infused, complements the crust and mozzarella cheeses perfectly  Cheese and oil: expect your pizza to be dressed lightly with mozzarella and olive oil, I LIKE THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH CHEESE because the flavor balance would be out of whack, also the olive oil adds a nice creamy texture and sweetness to the herb-topped and meat-topped offerings  Meats: huge fan of their ground sausage and also proscuitto. if you're getting meat, get one of these  Panini: personally big fan of the eggplant with bell peppers and zucchini, pretty regular summer lunch pick on a sunny day!  Gelati: huge fan of death by chocolate, lemon sorbetto, cherry bourdeaux, and dark chocolate straciatella",

It would have been nice to have a refill before the check came but the food was still delicious!",

    "text": "Mercurio's: Authentic Neapolitan Pizza and Artisanal Gelato   While visiting family and friends this weekend in upstate NY, my husband and I were sharing our infatuation for Mercurio's pizza.  Our declaration of love for this charming little pizza and gelato eatery came after dining on a sad pie from the local \"pizza shop.\"  Let it be said now, Mercurio's is not your average pizza shop.  It's more like a mini vacation to Italy.  Mercurio's is operated by Anna and Michael Mercurio (siblings).  It's obvious that this family run business cares about quality ingredients and the tradition of making food from one's heritage.  Michael is the head chef and is certified by the Italian government to make Neapolitan pizza.  Neapolitan pizza is distinct from other pizzas because Michael must follow certain rules.  I learned, after reading up on the guidelines on Mercurio's site, that the foundation of most pizzas is simple, fresh ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce and mozzarella cheese.  The dough consists of wheat flour, yeast, salt, and water.  Michael is not allowed to use a rolling pin while ensuring that his dough is no more than 3mm thick.  He then bakes the pizza 60-90 seconds in a 485 C (905 F) stone oven with an oak-wood fire.  The flavors and textures you get from this specialty oven are incredible.  The toppings are also mind-blowingly fresh and healthy.  Sorry, folks, if you want a grease-laden mountain of processed meats you're in the wrong spot.  Rather, most pizzas are topped with items such as arugula, artichokes, Prosciutto di Parma, grape tomatoes, basil, and so on.  No napkin blotting or guilty feelings required when dining on this pie.

    "text": "Mercurio's is back -- bigger and badder, if only in its space. The serving size seems to have shrunk a bit and/or the price seems a little higher than in my (granted, not always infallible) memory.   The gelato is still good, and the selection is still wide, but a lot of the bins looked more than half empty without being replaced.   The space is pleasing and airy and spacious. Instead of the cramped little second floor store of yore, Mercurio's now has beautiful picture windows that look right onto Walnut. It can now accommodate more than one group of sit down customers. However, I feel like it lost a bit of its quirky charm in the process. Now, it looks like any other Walnut establishment -- polished in a generic way.  The people who worked the counter, however, didn't seem to really want to be there. I suppose I did show up on a late Saturday afternoon, so the servers may be anxious to end their shifts.   I was so excited when I found out that they've re-opened, but I have to admit, my first re-visit was something of a disappointment. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, or maybe they still have a few more issues to work out during their transition period. I'll try them again in a few more weeks. For now though, 3.5 stars.",

The ice cream (or gelato or frozen dairy treat or whatever it's called) was delicious, though.  But I still felt that little pit-in-the-stomach feeling of \"Crap, I just spent way too much money on something I didn't need,\" while I was eating it, which sort of ruined the experience.  If money ain't a thang, this is probably a pretty awesome place.",

But I finally tried the pizza here, and was pleasantly surprised at how authentic it was! Props for NOT adding oregano to the sauce! I thought the crust could use a little more char and chew but this is me being picky...it's really, really good pizza. Way better than overhyped Piccolo Forno!  I have to say it's sad that they only have one pizza topped with Mozzarella di Bufala, and when I asked if I could get another pizza with Bufala, I got the \"no substitutions\" BS. Come on, it's not really a substitution...it's more like I'll pay you extra to upgrade my cheese. Nope, they wouldn't have it.  The pricing is also weird. The Margherita is $9 (very reasonable) but the exact same pizza, with Bufala, is $15 (overpriced, IMO). Il Pizzaiolo only has a $3 difference between their regular and Bufala Margheritas, which are more expensive, but much bigger.  While my heart still belongs to Il Pizzaiolo, this is a great option if you're craving DOC pizza and don't want to leave the East End. Especially if you want gelato for dessert!",

The underdog and underrated flavor is the blueberry muffin. It is mm mmm good! Just give it a taste test before you decide and you won't be disappointed.

I have been here about 3 times in the past month- yes I am a little obsessed.  Let's start with dessert first... the gelato.. is amazing! It's some of the best I have ever had. After trying it the first time, I was head over heels in love. My parents and I were in Lawrenceville, craving ice cream on Mother's Day, and the one place that popped in my head was this place. We came and they LOVED it. I think the blueberry muffin is my favorite... it's incredible. I also really enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake. My parents couldn't stop raving about their choices as well.  My dad was impressed with the brick oven and went over to talk to the employees about it. They were super friendly to my dad and very welcoming. They recommended that he try the sausage pizza with extra sausage and extra cheese and my dad could not resist. Which leads me to...  ...the food. Yummmm. The pizza that was recommended to my dad was incredible and he loved it. He could not stop raving about it and said that the leftovers were even better the next day. We recently just visited again and this time, I ordered my own pizza. I kept it simple, ordering the Bianca (white pizza with tomatoes and basil). It was awesome- light, with a perfect fluffy crust. The flavors were fresh and just delicious. My mom ordered the ensalata con portabella- wow... the portabellas were prepared perfectly! The dressing was light and full of flavor. My dad ordered the italiano panini, which was epic. Perfect amount of meat, bread, cheese and sauce... I was surprised with how much I loved it.  This place is the whole package. Located right on Walnut Street, it's the perfect place for a date night or casual lunch. Service was great all three times I have visited as well. I can't wait to return.",

    "text": "I'm normally not a huge fan of pizza in Pittsburgh, but Mercurio's is soooooooooooo good! I ordered the Pizza Del Re and the Marinara and they were both amazing. The prosciutto on the Del Re was salty but sooooooooooooo delicious when eaten with the mushrooms. Even the marinara, despite being such a simple pizza with few ingredients was sooooooooooooo good! The pizzas come in relatively big slices, so I usually take it and fold it in half to eat it.   I also tried the Chocolate Coffee Bean gelato, which was a great ender to the meal; the coffee flavor came out a lot more than the chocolate, but I didn't have a problem with that. I will say that a lot of their gelato flavors seem relatively similar to each other (e.g. chocolate+coffee+nuts), but there are so many that visitors will probably find a favorite pretty quickly.",

The 2nd time, I awaited at the register yet again while 2 employees had a heated discussion about how to change the register tape. Nobody acknowledged my presence until one of the pizza makers thankfully exhorted them to help me. Overall, the pizzas were fairly good; however, I think they could afford to add a bit more cheese and tomatoes; the items on the pizza were a bit lacking in quantity. Their biggest hurdle, though, is to perhaps better train and supervise the employees.",

Let's talk about Mercurio's in its latest location reincarnation. The quality of the gelato is superb, and I haven't disliked one flavour I've tried. Personally, I like the texture and the flavour punch of gelato better compared to its sister, ice cream. Some of my favourite flavours at Mercurio's are: lemon basil, chocolate hazelnut (Nutella), raspberry chocolate chip, and the dark stracciatella. Seriously, you can never go wrong with Mercurio's. The people that work there are super friendly too, and it's a family-run business. I'm glad they moved to this spot right on Walnut, but they have a lot of traffic during the hotter months no matter where they are located. Try it out if you're ever in the Eastside.",

    "text": "I tried Mercurio's gelato two years ago and, more recently, at the Yelp Burgh Bash this past Sept., and I finally had the chance to stop by for dinner last Sat.  Based on my experience with the gelato and what I'd heard from Yelp and elsewhere, I was eager to try Mercurio's savory offerings.  My dining partner and I shared a house salad (insalata de la casa), as well as a prosciutto pizza.  (Thanks for the great recommendation, fellow Yelpers!)  The house salad consisted of spring greens, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and parmesan dressed with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and included two pieces of toasted Italian bread.  I found the salad to be quite fresh and flavorful, and large enough for two people to share comfortably.  In terms of flavor, I found the pizza to be quite solid, with the prosciutto being the standout, with just the right amount of smokiness and saltiness.  It also hid a few key shortcomings, such as a sparser-than-preferable amount of cheese, quite effectively.  If you've read my reviews of other pizza places around PGH, you'll know that the aspect of pizza that I tend to be persnickety about is the crispness of the crust. While the crust was light and airy, which was great, it unfortunately lacked the key crispness on the bottom that's essential to a perfect pizza, in my view.  Nevertheless, I was generally pretty satisfied with the quality of the pizza, esp. compared to other wood-fired pizza places around town.  Needless to say, after finishing the savory portion of our meal, my dining partner and I had to order the gelato, since that's what Mercurio's is best known for.  I had a small, which I split between mint chocolate chunk (my favorite!) and triple chocolate, and my dining partner had a medium, split between chocolate and caramel.  The gelato was just as delectable as I remembered, with satisfying creaminess and flavors.  While the ambiance was a bit minimalist, I didn't mind. My one complaint about the layout was that the dining area was quite small and could feel a bit cramped at times.  (At one point, we had to move our table over a bit so that our neighbors could squeeze through.)  I found the service to be a slower than I'd like, but this was probably due to there being only one waitress responsible for serving all of the dining tables.  Even one more waiter probably would have sped things up and reduced the stress on her significantly.  Overall, despite a couple of shortcomings, I had a pleasant experience dining at Mercurio's, and would definitely return.",

I mean, I'm not a big coconut guy, just a chocolate guy, and it's certainly the best chocolate related item I've had there. The German chocolate is similarly constituted and thus a close second. But for whatever reason they treat these items like Step-flavors. I even call ahead sometimes only to be disappointed over the phone. I wish they'd address this issue. Otherwise a fantastic place, sans chocolate-coconut combos.",

    "text": "I'm actually really surprised that I hadn't already written a review for Mercurio's. I've been to this place more times than I can count! They have an amazing pizza menu and I have yet to order a pizza I didn't like. One of the owners has been certified by the Italian government to make pizza, so its definitely legit! The dough is perfect and I'm usually not a crust kind of girl and I gobble the whole pizza up! My favorite is the Pizze del Rey and Salsiccia...oh and you can't go wrong with the Ricotta or Quattro Formaggi! Let's be real. I love 'em all.   Another notable menu item is their house salad. Its simplest yet most delicious salad my taste buds have ever had the opportunity to dine on. The dressing is light and flavorful and salty. There are chunks of fresh mozzarella and cut grape tomatoes and its served with a to-die-for grilled bread on the side.   You were probably thinking this place couldn't possibly get any better, and in most situations you'd be right, but THERE'S MORE. Decadent, creamy, delicious gelato is also a must-order at Mercurio's. The owners' mother makes all of the gelato and the flavors are out of this world. My favorite is the blueberry muffin. Its full of blueberries and crumbled cakey goodness.   The best part of Mercurio's is if you really want to, you can walk out of there spending less than $50 for a couple without a problem and you don't have to sacrifice quality of food or fullness to do it!",

I usually get the Margherita pizza and it is very good every time. they have the brick oven right there so you can watch them cook it.  All in all, my boyfriend and I like it and came to the conclusion that it is a good place when you are looking for restaurant pizza, but not just a pizza joint. A little bit less casual than a pizza joint.   Still good food though and I recommend it to people often.",

THEN you had to go and open your pizza oven and serve delicious pizza at great prices with nice outdoor seating.  TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY.  My thighs will never be the same.  After tasting the Amaretto gelatto, I discovered that my life had been missing something all along and that amaretto gelato wsa its missing piece.  Sounds like I've got a food addiction.  Don't judge me.  Try the gelato and pizza and then you tell me how you're doing SO MUCH BETTER than I am.  ;)",

My friends and I ordered 2 pizzas for 3 people and our favorite was the contadina, with red sauce! Their red sauce is on the sweet side and tastes homemade and fresh. (Unlike a lot of marinara out there) The grilled eggplant (though very limited in quantity) was delicious! Really wish they put more vegetables on the pizzas instead of a few pieces here and there. The gelato was of course wonderful - rich and creamy! (Big advocate for the tiramisu gelato). Overall, a nice joint if you're looking for flavorful pizza followed by some nice dessert all in one place!",

If you sit near the back, you can see them preparing the pizza! Tables are a little close together, so probably not the best for business or more private conversations. Great people/dog-watching out the window.  2 beers, 2 pizzas, and 2 gelatos with tip was around $50. Not cheap, but very good!  We got the Margherita and Diavola pizzas, which were both excellent. Light yet filling & satisfying. I think you can ask for olive oil if you'd like to dip your crust. The table next to us had bruschetta, which looked great. We also had Death By Chocolate and Tiramisu gelato -- sooo good!  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Finding Mercurio's was like finding the Holy Grail. As a Pizza Partisan, Za is my lifeblood, my ambrosia, you could say. I'm dealing with some (temporary) dietary restrictions that make healthy/safe pizza consumption very difficult. Thankfully, Mercurios' au naturale Neapolitans are offered with gluten free crust Monday-Wednesday Isaac-friendly and are absolutely delicious.  ZA REVIEW: Pizza is prepped with a fresh and simple tomato sauce, on a traditional or gluten free crust. Then they sprinkle homemade mutz and toppings on the pie before cooking. Upon removal, fresh olive oil (and basil if in the recipe) is applied, the server cuts the pizza in four, and delivers it piping hot your table. The cornicione (crust space) in my gluten free pie was a little too wide for my taste, and the coastline (space of sauce between cheese and crust) was a bit too wide, even for Neopolitan standards. Essentially, my pie could have been formed with more care (check posted photos). Regardless, flavor, quality of ingredients, CSC (crust-cheese-sauce) ratio and freshness were all on par. I give Mercurio's gluten free pizza a 7.3/10 pepperonis. I will return o review when I can eat the standard crust.   My parents and I split two small gelatos: chocolate PB cup and dulche de leche. They were to die for, I had a small amount and it didn't make me sick so hell yeah!  SERVICE REVIEW: Frankly, in terms of service, I was disappointed. I understand the virtue and pride a restaurant holds toward the sanctity of its menu items, but refusing to make substitutions based off of my mom's dietary needs came across as cocky. The customer is always right, and if my mom REALLY wanted some to substitute a heavy meat with basil on her pizza, couldn't they have done so? Furthermore, my pizza came a good 5 minutes before my parents', so there was an undesirable consumption lag. Lastly, they took one of the extra chairs from our table which really doesn't mean much but I had this awkward open space to my left, and what if I my imaginary friend was sitting there?  BOTTOM LINE: Mercurio's is a WONDERFUL neopolitan pizza and gelato destination in Shadyside. Their ingredients are fresh and their pies savory. They are knowledgeable and passionate about their food, which is attests to the strength of their menu, but is also incurs perceivable weakness; lacking to some customers who want and need accommodations to eat. Mercurio's gets 4 stars because of these traits, and for providing me with Italian Pie in my struggling times.",

Sometimes the charred flavor can overpower the otherwise simple ingredients.   We've visited the restaurant in Shadyside several times. We love the different pizza combinations, my favorite is the basic margarita pizza. We also love all the gelato options.   The outdoor seating is great and I've seen people dine with their dogs. The employees are friendly too.   Most recently we've found them at events such as Little Italy Days. I love that it's fresh and high quality ingredients. I also give the people working major credit, we were so hot, I can't imagine how hot they were next to the pizza oven! They were still friendly though and had a smile on their faces!",

    "text": "This is probably the only place to bother eating at on Walnut street. Fresh, artisanal pizza. Great tasting, light-textured gelato.  Friendly servers and staff.   The pizza? Fantastic. It will take time for the to make it, and it is not any damned Pizza Hut where they stuff you full of dough. The veggies are fresh, the cheese like velvet, and dough complements all the textures. I actually got accustomed to *not* being full just for the flavor and refreshing nature of a meal here.   Some issues I have are with the setup of the restaurant itself. It is hard to tell where to sit/stand for pizza or gelato. I walk in and am not sure who to talk to or where to go. Grab a server? Go to the register? Just sit down?  Maybe a hanging sign above where you should go for what you wish to buy would help. (Though that would totally destroy the decor, I know).   It may just be too small a place given its popularity. It can get crowded and loud with all the traffic. The gelato brings large families, kids, etc. This is kind of cool, but can detract from the dining experience if you are unprepared.   If the staff seem harried or aloof, it is more because of the bougie restaurant goers that are denizens of the area, than the staff not caring about customers. At least, that is my opinion of all my experiences there.   The menu is one-page, and it may help if there was some general categorizations of the pizzas there. The list is flat, but since I try to be veggie, it would be nice if there was some breakdown on the pizza types based on general toppings.",

The food is good; the pizza is good, the calzone is very good and, despite what my bf thinks, the gelato is great.   My problem with this place is the STAFF!!!!  In all the times I have been there I've had 1 positive experience with the staff. ONE! The staff are frequently goofing around, talking, texting (my favorite) and generally treat you as if you are interrupting their day by patronizing their establishment. It's not just the actual sit-down wait staff either. The gelato servers are always young and bitchy. Sometimes it seems the only constant in this this place is the revolving door of young and bitchy staff. I know some people who have worked there and from what I understand the owners know about this and overlook it. They hire friends, and friends of friends, and no one gets reprimanded. That's the worst part for me. I work in a service based industry where there is no excuse for poor service and my BF is a long time bartender/bar manager. I know good service and how to tip for it. Having said that, we don't seem to want to go to Mercurio's anymore, and it's not because of the food.",

And I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of food (and gelato!!). The servers and staff were all very nice, especially when I walked in on an empty night a half hour before closing time. They were more than happy to start up a pizza and hand out a bunch of samples of the gelato. Damn is it good! There was a nice variety of flavors, and I ended up getting something I had never tried until that night (salted caramel truffle). I split a lasagna pizza (lasagna pizza, what?!) with the boy, and they were nice enough to make the other side meat-free for me. And it was great.  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here and I will definitely be back.",

It was packed, but they had left 2 tables in the front for gelato eaters, which I thought was really nice.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that paying by the ounce is weird when you aren't filling up the cup yourself, but after tasting it, I could care less how much I pay for it.   J got the birthday cake which had huge chunks - huge! - of birthday cake.  I got the caramel chocolate latte.  Wow.  It was ridiculously creamy and flavorful.    I also really like that the cups are biodegradable - always nice to give back to the earth.   If you haven't been for the gelato, you must go.  Tons of flavors, something for everyone!",

After the Yelp Elite event there (which was awesome!) my wife and I went back for lunch and had the bufala mozzarella pizza and the portobello salad. The pizza tasted okay, but the consistency was all off. The dough was soggy (too much sauce??) and limp, and nothing actually stayed on the pizza (it all just fell right off). The salad was also okay (the lemon zest was a nice touch), but it was pretty uninspired. Just a bunch of arugula and maybe 1/2 a mushroom cap...that's it.  If I were in a pinch, I would probably go back...but it won't be my top choice.  That said, get the gelato!",

The mozzarella is fresh and homemade too, and if you have ever tried fresh mozzarella on pizza, you certainly know the difference.  The gelato here is fantastic as well - best in the city, and all homemade.  There are too many flavors that sound delicious for me to try, so I will certainly be back for more.

    "text": "This place was fantastic! I'm a fanatical pizza lover and generally prefer just plain pepperoni but the menu here is static and this wasn't an option. And yet, I couldn't be happier.  We tried the Oliva, with tomato sauce, black olives, basil, and mozzarella, and let me tell you, it was wonderful! The man I was with has had pizza in Italy and said this wasn't too far off from what he tasted there.The crust was delicate and light while still having a rustic feel and enough body to carry the heaviness of the cheese. The mozzarella was clearly of a high quality, the tomato sauce was gorgeous in both color and flavor, the olives gave it pizazz, and the basil complemented everything else beautifully to make a wonderfully well rounded flavor. It is probably the second best pizza I have ever tasted, the first being Memphis Pizza Cafe in Memphis, TN, and as much pizza as I have tried, thats really something!    And for that, we paid 10$. It was really remarkable.   Afterwards, we each got a cup of gelato for the walk home, and this was splendid as well! There were sooo many flavors, it was very difficult to choose! Many had things mixed in like chocolate pieces or cherries or pie crust. The flavors were very diverse. The toasted coconut was a perfect balance of toasty coconut and soft creamy chocolate. The caramel latte was the best coffee flavored ice cream I have ever had. I don't generally like coffee, but this was perfectly subtle in its coffee flavor with a punch of caramel after it sits on your tongue for a moment. It was really a fantastic treat and we paid less for this than we would have at a Cold Stone or Marble Slab.  All in all, if you do not like pizza, this may not be the place for you, but if you're fond of Italian, do not miss this place!! I will only be in town for another three days and I am already planning to go back for one more round before I leave. Worth every penny of the less than 20$ tab and a fabulous experience!",

Mercurio's offers an extensive variety of flavors, from chocolate to vanilla, Nutella and pistachio, etc. Lots of choices for people with different palates, and best of all, each size allows for scoops from 2 or more flavors. A lovely, creamy texture, and not too heavy or rich.  The pizza I am on the fence about.  Mercurio's offers artisan flavor combinations and I love that it's fired in a brick oven. The crust is both crispy and chewy, a nice consistency in my opinion, but the sauce is SO bland. My companion and I shared a Caprese appetizer (deelish) and a Funghi pizza. The mozzarella on the Funghi was fresh and firm, the basil was strong and flavorful, the mushrooms had a delightful texture, but the sauce was like a wet blanket over all of it. It needs a dash more .. something. Salt, perhaps?  Another gripe I have: the layout. If you're just walking in for gelato, the case is right up front and it's quite convenient. But if you want to dine in, you have to try to squeeze in-between gelato-goers at the front and seated tables on the side just to get to a manager or someone on the wait staff to let them know you want a table and some menus.  Otherwise, service was prompt and friendly. I could see myself eating here again, or, at the very least, coming back for that yummy gelato.",

    "text": "My fiance is awesome and he didn't like his food so this place deserves a 3! Haha jk!  But the truth is we went there and had high hopes with the good reviews. I ordered a salame caprese pizza that I thoroughly enjoyed. The pizza was decently sized, but it was also extremely thing so it wasn't going to stuff anyone's face. The flavors were there and it was fresh out of the oven. Per my fiance, he still likes Piccolo Forno pizza better. As for him, he got a eggplant Parma that was more on the bland side. Also we prefer eggplants that are softer/cooked more. If you like chewy eggplant then give this one a try.  We also got a banana milkshake that was good but it wasn't anything different than other milkshakes. We did not try their gelato, so this review is purely on their food.  But yes I would definitely go back again to try their gelatos (and food too)! Maybe it would be different next time!",

    "text": "PIZZA DEL REY. I have not tried the gelato yet (gasp!). But the pizza is one of my favorites in the city. Again, PIZZA DEL REY. So amazing. I hate to seem all trendy and such, but damn, I love truffle oil.  The pizza crust is incredibly thin--almost too thin at times. It is not always crispy enough and can get quite soggy under all the toppings and cheese. But the crust has a nice, simple flavor.  The pizzas have fresh toppings and are fire-baked, so they come out quickly and (usually) cooked to perfection. The problem with those ovens, though, is sometimes spots of the crust are burnt while the rest is a little underdone.  They offer some wines and some beers, but it's not a very large selection. Likewise, the salads and sandwiches do not have a ton to offer, but I have not tried one yet, so I can't say anything about their quality.  I guess since they just semi-recently expanded to serve pizza, I will cut them a little slack for the lack of boozing options and limited food menu. I hope they expand a little to add more space and maybe pasta!  Service is always pleasant, but usually kind of slow. I guess that's ok because I am never in a rush if I sit down to eat there. I find it a little strange there is no host or anything because if you go in on a super busy night, you'll find yourself awkwardly in the way or seemingly standing in line for gelato. Meh. Oh well!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Thursday for a snack of sorts with my girlfriend.  Both of us had been wanting to try Mecurios as we both used to love the place whenever it was only a small gelato shop.  The inside of the restaurant was interesting with what seemed like half of the shop for employees and the other half for patrons.  This was further divided by the gelato area which had around 20 different selections and 2 reserved tables and the restaurant which had a nice looking wood brick oven and the rest of the tables.  My girlfriend and I decided to start off out meal with the pesto pistachio antipasti which was pistachio and basil pesto with cheese and orange zest served on a pizza crust.  The flavors were good and I enjoyed both the pesto sauce and pizza crust but the real winner was the orange zest.  It was prevalent enough that you could taste it and its citrusy flavor but did not overpower the pistachio and basil.  For our main pizza to split my girlfriend and I decided on the salame calibrese which was a pizza topped with tomatoes, basil, EVOO, mozzarella and salame.  The crust tasted the same as the first and was good but I didn't think the bottom was firm enough.  Now I don't want to go arguing with the AVPN but I want to be able to pick up my pizza to eat it but with this I could not and had to use a fork.  Even with that being said the pizza was still good and the salame giving a nice saltiness to it.  The bottom line for me is that I will probably head back here in the future.  Granted that it may be for Gelato but there is always the off chance that I could order a pizza again and I would shy away if someone else wanted to go here.",

At the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the Pizza Del Re, and also ordered the Primavera at our own volition. The Primavera was pretty good, but the Pizza Del Re was out of this world. All of the ingredients were great, but I think it was the truffle spread that put this over the top.  These pizzas can be a little tricky to eat without losing all of the toppings. We tried knife-and-fork plus the usually pizza-eating techniques, but found that the best way to eat it without making a mess is to fold the piece in half (so you are essentially creating another pie-shaped piece that is half the size). This keeps all of your toppings on and lets the \"juice\" seep out the back.  I tend to go to an unnamed (3-star worthy) frozen yogurt place just down the street when my sweet -tooth kicks in, but this will definitely be my new go-to. I tried the caramel latte and the pistachio, and if you are sitting down for dinner, your waiter/waitress can serve it for you so you avoid the line.   I want to try to Salami pizza next and there are a few more gelato flavors that I was tempted by, so I'm sure I will be back soon.",

    "text": "In every scoop of Mercurios Gelato there are over 13+ years of research, study, testing, obsession and love in their dozens of freshly made daily offerings.  Mrs. Mercurio and her husband took endless culinary workshops and university courses studying every aspect of ice cream and gelato production and you can experience the fruits of their labor in every taste.  They recently added pizza to their offerings.  The Mercurio's son trained at an authentic Sicilian pizza shop and they had an italian pizza oven imported to give an authentic product.   While many rave about the pizza at piccolo forno in lawrenceville, I found Mercurios to be much more authentic (and delicious) compared to the pizza I had in Italy.  The pizza dough is paper thin and savory (almost like crepes) the toppings are all fresh, generously administered and the crust is perfectly crispy.  The raw brick walls and black and white photos of italy complement the atmosphere and the staff were all extremely friendly and enthusiastic.  I'm not normally a huge Gelato or Pizza fan, but Mercurio's does not offer normal gelato or pizza.  They are the finest example of both I've tasted in Pittsburgh, I look forward to many more happy meals and desserts here, Mercurios has made me a believer!",

Gleaming glass displays of gelatos await as you stroll through the door...it looks like a painter's palette of deliciousness all ready for sampling.  So sample away!  Friendly servers/scoopers are generous with tiny silver spoons laden with whatever temptation tickles your curious gelato fancy. The staff is so friendly and helpful!    After extensive sampling, I chose Blackberry Merlot for my first scoop and the totally decadent Dark Chocolate Salted Caramel.  Rich, smooth, cold, creamy luscious frozen cream teeming with flavors that made me swoon with happiness.  Bravissimo!  Oh, and lest you think Mercurio's is for sweets only, the pizzas, salads and other treats are authentic Italian masterpieces, as well!  The pizzas, straight from the brick oven imported from Italy, were gorgeous!  Word is (that old gluten devil prevented me from sampling the pizzas) the flavors matched the beauty of the crusts and toppings.  Speaking of toppings....Mercurios makes their own mozzarella!!!!!  Wow.  That gluten issue regarding pizza at Mercurios may soon be a thing of the past.  Linda Mercurio's husband (Dr. Mercurio!) is diligently working on a gluten-free crust!  Once he has perfected it, gluten-free pizza will be on the menu and I, for one, cannot wait!",

The panini's are sub-par and the appetizers are terribly overpriced (just like everything else here). Gellato is also quite good. Definitely worth a trip.",

I've had a LOT of pizza in the last week and I've always wanted to try something else off their menu. It's a nice and simple panini with a deliciously crunchy bread and the tomatoes inside were large and juicy. The flavor of the prosciutto was subtle, but I really appreciated that it wasn't drowned in a bunch of unnecessary sauces and veggies inside which would have made it disappear altogether. It comes with some salad on the side, and I hate salad dressing so I had a bite and really just hated it, but my friend sitting next to me had a bite and ended up eating the whole thing. The panini was great, but I think I prefer eating the pizza - it's more filling and pizza is one of my favorite foods. I'll definitely consider a panini again if I come here without an empty stomach. I also had some blueberry cheesecake gelato which was really delicious. I got it with the samoa flavor, but I would consider getting it on its own next time to really fully appreciate its flavor. BTW, the crust isn't as good dipped with the blueberry cheesecake as it is in the samoa. The service today was also worse than I am used to receiving, our server seemed new and confused and got one of my friend's order wrong, so she got her pizza way later, and then it was still messed up when the check came.",

Semi sweet sauce and just enough cheese per bite help accompany that great brick fired taste. Though the pizza crust is thin, it's still a very filling pizza - but make sure you save room for dessert! It's a great place to come sit down and enjoy the meal or to just swing in and grab a small cup of gelato. I think I've tried about half the gelato flavors they have and have yet to be disappointed. It's very rich in flavor and for someone like me who always needs something after dinner, this always does the trick. I work on Walnut St. and will always recommend this place to people!",

The rapini came off in huge stalks, the finely ground sausage was all over the place. The consistency of this finely ground sausage is disgusting. The only thing i liked about this pie was the crust. We had the bruschetta for an appetizer, it was a cold soggy mess!!! The chocolate chocolate chip gelato we had for dessert was nothing more than very cheap ice cream. The TP fixture in the bathroom was falling off, the walls were dingy, dirty and quite scuffed up in places. There was no manager available to talk to. My guess the owners are totally absent. Strike one, strike two, strike three! Like i said, \"What a Joke\" Only thing i thought was decent was the crust and the service. Wish i would have taken pictures so those reading this can see for themselves. Unfortunate way to end my vacation",

    "text": "This is not your typical football pizza. They are fancier with truffle oils, bruschetta and etc. they have my favorite pizza that has mushroom, bruschetta and truffle oil and I've had it many times and never get tired of it. There is no better pizza in the world that is better than this. This is a must try if you love any of those ingredients. The crust is not crispy but more on the softer side. They don't use electrical over but I guess that is the standard for a nice pizza place. Not only they have my favorite pizza, they also have the best balsamic sauce with fresh cheese. Personally I think summer is the best time to visit as all the vegetable are in season. It just provides a prefect balance/mix flavor to start the meal.  After a tasty meal, house-made gelato is another must have. They have so many flavors  to offer and ask for a sample if you are not sure what to get. All the flavors are so great! I think I just can't have enough nice words to say about this place.  Last, I think this is a vegetarian friendly restaurant. So it is for everyone.",

Most of the time we stop here these days is for their gelato which is always delicious - personal favorite is the key lime when it's available.  This would normally be a five star review, but the reason we haven't eaten here in some time is that during my last two visits we had to deal with fruit flies. Enough of them that I lost my temper a bit and vowed to not come back. During my most recent visit, wouldn't you know it we had another one... but just one this time so it wasn't as big a deal.  There clearly is an issue that must come and go here, I'm not sure the root cause but hopefully they get it 100% sorted out because their pizza and salads are fantastic!",

I would definitely come here to carb load before a race.   The menu seems expansive but is only combinatorial, meaning that there are lots of different toppings that we've all thought about merging, i.e. the variety brings nothing new to the palette. Nevertheless, for its price and quality, I am very comfortable giving Mercurio's a solid 4. They make the pizza right! If they perhaps worked on their ambiance more (we sat in an area that as right next to the counter, which led to continuous traffic by our table for the duration of dinner), I could bump this to 5. Keep it up, Mercurio's!",

The pizzas are more \"Italian style\" that feature fresh slices of mozzarella as opposed to the shredded stuff and there is no pepperoni to be found.  I've probably had every pizza there is here and they are all good, but my favorites include the margherita, prosciutto, and quattro formaggi.  The mozzarella is really the star of the show and it is really top notch.  When combined with the rest of the tasty ingredients and excellent preparation, the result is a really good pizza.  The salads are also excellent and the gellato is good, but good luck having enough room left over after your meal to be able to eat any.  Otherwise, the restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the staff is attentive and helpful.",

And I'm not talking browned, but charred. The prosciutto was placed on top of the sliced pizza, so we had to cut it ourselves which was a pain since we only had dull knives. The panini was okay, but nothing to write home about. Luckily, we had a 50% off one pizza coupon through Loyal Tree. We finished the night off with gelato which is really the redeeming quality of this place. Come for the gelato, for sure! Skip the pizza.",

The pizza was pretty flavorful, but I was very disappointed with how watery it was. Since I've only had it once, it could certainly be due to the particular ingredients that came on my pizza. The crust seemed properly cooked and everything - but there was just too much water on top.  I quite like that they use the hotter-than-hell-flash-cook method for cooking the pizzas. I much prefer the thin crust and nice charred taste that it provides compared to the thick crust baked wonderbread taste.  The gelato was all delicious. Nice selection of flavors.  The staff was very friendly as well. I'll definitely be back to see about getting a slightly drier pizza. Hopefully they can get bumped up a star or two if they deliver.",

The Margherita pizza did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crisp on the edges but soft in the middle.    Why 3 stars.  The poor waitress, one, had a lot of tables and was falling behind but very mindful and stopped to check on us,   Finally, received some assistance from someone from the basement kitchen but it was just to slow.   The salads and Gelato looked great...so next time.",

    "text": "The redeeming quality of this place is the gelato. Because it sure as shit isn't the $16 pan sized margarita pizza made by the local paper boy. Last time I paid $16 for dough and sauce was when I was at Pizza Taglio (see other review).  The pizza fate here suffers the same inconsistencies as every other new \"hip\" pizza parlor in Shadyside/EastLiberty/IDon'tCareWhere.  And that is, too little sauce used on a heaping pound of dough creates one of the biggest spectacles since the Drumpf presidency.  Tell Ralph, the pizza boy to spread the sauce evenly, add a bit more sauce and make THE FACKING CRUSTS SMALLER! That way you don't have a lake forming in the center of the pizza.  This place is a Shadyside staple for their ice cream gelato. And that's it. You're not flying over from Palermo for their pies. And if you are, then there is something wrong with you my fine feathered friend. They have over 20 different flavors of \"gelato\", and usually, on a Saturday, standing at the crest of Negley hill, deep in the heart of July, you can see a large line forming.",

I had been a good boy and was walking by when I decided that I could actually indulge in some form of ice cream. I really like chocolate. I love hazelnut. Seeing that I could get both I had them give me half and half in a cup.  Yum!  Definitely some of the better gelato I have ever eaten. I will definitely return here when I get a chance. I cannot eat a lot of ice cream at any given time and the sheer power in the flavor that comes through makes up for the small amounts that I can eat.  YUM!",

The atmosphere is very classy and feels very much like a place where adults would enjoy a sweet treat. The selection is great and the flavors all sound very delicious. I was a little confused by the menu located behind the freezers, which may have contributed to the high cost of my gelato. Ultimately I ended up buying the medium-sized, two flavor gelato... which can range in weight up to 3oz (or $2.50) depending on how the server decides to scoop it.  While the gelato is excellent, it is overpriced in my opinion. I don't think I can justify spending $6 on a tiny dish of frozen goodness, no matter how good it may be. This place will be an occasional treat but isn't likely to be a frequent stop.",

The good: I actually like their pizza dough which has a nice consistency and has those little burn marks that make it feel \"authentic\". One of their appetizers has pistachio pesto served on a pizza crust with some orange zest and I liked the combination.  The less good: the toppings are sometimes inconsistent with some pizza ending up delicious and some ... umm just not so much. We tried only the veggie panini and it was ok. Their salads appear interesting on the menu but they were a hit or miss for me.   I've had both dinner and lunch there and for some reason for dinner we got served much faster than for lunch.   I don't know why it has only one dollar sign for the price because their menu item are definitely more. A pizza + a shared appetizer can definitely get you around $20.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Pittsburgh for a concert, and a friend of mine recommended we check out Mercurio's while we were in town. Great recommendation!  We went to their Shadyside location and ordered the Romana pizza, which had house made mozzarella cheese, cooked Italian ham, and basil. I've never been to Italy, but this pizza tasted like what I would imagine pizza in Italy tastes like! The crust was chewy and flavorful, while the toppings (especially the house made fresh mozzarella) were bursting with flavor. The sauce added a slight acidity that balanced everything out. We split the 4 slice pizza between us in order to save room for gelato (more on that in a minute). However, under typical circumstances, I'd say that a person could probably eat a whole pizza themselves.   Now to the gelato, which Mercurio's makes in house as well. They easily offered 20+ varieties, sold by the ounce. My wife got \"Death by Chocolate\" and strawberry cheesecake, while I ordered pistachio, coconut cream pie, and dulche de leche. The flavors were all very unique and outstanding!! I swear I could taste some cinnamon in the pistachio, but whatever the case may be, the gelato was a big hit with both of us.   Unfortunately we live 2+ hours away, otherwise we'd make Mercurio's a frequent destination. As it is, we will definitely be back the next time we're in Pittsburgh!",

What's different about Mercurio's pizza is that they actually have some char to their crust and they use a much brighter sauce than you usually see at an \"Italian\" pizza joint. In addition to the brighter sauce, they use grape tomatoes to brighten it even further and give some acid to the pizza. There's also the option to replace regular Mozzarella with Buffalo Mozzarella, very cool!  The gelato is smoother and more flavorful than I've had elsewhere and is definitely very high quality. You can order it by the ounce making it really easy to taste many flavors.   This is the real deal here.",

We both ordered the pizza of course. I ordered the Funghi because I was having a mushroom craving. Everything from the dough to the mushrooms were cooked perfectly. The pizza itself is the perfect size for one person, but the best thing to do if you're with someone is to order two different things and give them both a try.

I love the fresh mozzarella, the tomato sauce is applied lightly but is so flavorful, and that basil leaf on my slice is the cherry on top.  Mercurio's has a few different salads, but they all have pretty much the same ingredients, and they somehow always have the freshest tomatoes no matter the season.  2-3 servers cover the entire restaurant.  They're friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, but way too busy to be focused, so drink and food orders can get mixed up.  They need to add at least 1 more server for their peak times.  The prices have steadily increased over the past couple of years (you'll pay $10-$17 per personal 12\" pizza) so it would be nice to see a new set of larger drink glasses, different chairs that don't wobble and slide more easily when you have to make room for someone seated at the table behind you, an increased number of servers, and/or salt and pepper at the tables.  So I have a couple cons for Mecurio's, but consistency equals stars for me which is why I gave it 4.    The next time you're at the Apple Store, walk a block down the street and get your pizza fix!",

    "text": "My Italian friends maintain this place has the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Their crust is definitely on the softer side, so if you like a crispy pizza you may be disappointed, but it's full of flavor and topped with delicious sauce and cheese!  I love smoked anything, so my favorite is the Provola (basically a margherita  with smoked mozzarella). I have found I prefer not to order their pizzas with toppings: the first time I came here I had the Contadina, which I felt came with pitifully few pieces of eggplant. But if you stick with their simpler pizzas you can't go wrong  As for the gelato, I love how they have creative flavors, but the gelato doesn't quite have the density and depth of flavor that you find in the best gelato places. I will admit I have extremely high standards when it comes to ice cream, so perhaps I am being overly picky, especially considering how hard it is to find gelato at all in Pittsburgh!",

We ordered Pizza Della Casa and I liked how fresh the ingredients on top of the pizza were. The dough was also perfectly baked and light. As for the gelato, we went for the black cherry which I thought was the best. I loved the small chunks of chocolate and cherry sprinkled into the gelato!  The price was also good and cheap.

Currently they only offer it Mon-Wed. I would hope that word would spread and they'd extend it to other days, but I assume it's just costly for them to make GF dough if it goes unused every day. But the dough... That's the main issue with GF pizza. Mercurio's pizza crust tasted exactly like regular dough. I couldn't tell the difference, I swear to you!  I never thought I could get my fave del ra pizza again. Again, thank god I could! I'm so excited to come back when I have a hankering for pizza. I only wish they were closer to home. But it's worth it to make the extra trip!",

    "text": "I heard from a friend that Mercurios was very good. I'm sad to write that my experience was below average here. I went in on April 24th 2019 6pm, casual Wednesday evening. Not crowded at all. Super excited and hungry. I walked in and the cashier was not too friendly. Had a bit of an attitude and was not easy to talk to at all. I asked for a plain cheese pizza and for some reason they couldn't do that. They only have margherita; fine. No big deal. I asked for extra cheese, apparently that was asking too much; but they did it. It took about 7 minutes to get my pizza to go. I was impressed by the short wait time. But when I got home I was again disappointed... slightly disgusted. It was poorly made. The crust was half of the pizza practically. The cheese was dropped on and barely melted. The whole thing was SO SO soggy and droopy when you picked up a slice (see photos). Hard to eat and tasted like wet bread with cold pieces of mozzarella on top (you can see the cheese just sitting on the dough in photos) But the mozzarella pieces immediately slid and fell off of the slice upon being picked up. It was like it wasn't even cooked? I don't understand. But somehow the crust was blackened/charred ... tasted slightly burnt and my fingers looked charred after eating. Messy and not good at all. They put no effort in making this simple pie for me.   UPDATE: Mercurio's responded to me basically saying that I ate the pizza the wrong way and that I waited too long to eat it after being taken out of the oven. \"Their pizza is meant to be eaten with a fork directly out of the oven\" Well I live a 5 minute walk from Mercurio's so I don't think I waited long to eat it. If I'd eaten it with a fork the cheese would still not be melted. I've eaten cold pizza out of a fridge before and that did not cause the cheese to suddenly be falling off the slice!? If their Neapolitan pizza has such delicate and detailed eating instructions then they should include them on the box or not allow pizza to be ordered to go! I don't appreciate \"the customer is wrong\" attitude of this establishment. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt but their defensive and disrespectful response has really turned me off. The pizza was poorly made and low quality. Obviously with any restaurant that has good food there will be an off night or  bad food made every now and then. They clearly can't own up to that. Them Criticizing my eating methods and \"how I chose to eat it\" is not how a business should speak to customers. Do not recommend at all, this response from the restaurant is exactly the negative attitude I commented on about the cashier in my original review",

I got the pistachio and tiramisu in a waffle cone. It came to $7 and some change. I thought that was fair because gelato is typically a lot heavier and creamier than regular ice cream.   The pistachio was good... but didn't taste like your normal pistachio. There was something in it that wasn't bad, but it didn't hit that pistachio gelato flavor that I was hoping for.   The tiramisu was better than the pistachio and didn't have an intense espresso flavor which I didn't mind. The waffle cone had to be homemade and had the perfect crunch to it.   If we're in the area again, we might return. It's not something I'll go out of my way for though.",

Great start....but I recommend requesting for a door that is not close to the front door especially on cold weather days.   Our waiter was helpful in explaining the items on the menu. The wait time for food was not long, maybe around 10 minutes for each of the items we ordered.   We ordered bruschetta for starters and pizza Roberto  The crust was softer and bigger than the typical crostini used for bruschetta. I recommend trying this. Pizza is good quantity for 2 people consisting of 4 big slices. It is a thin crust pizza.  Cheese is the center of attraction for the pizza Roberto. The main flavors were basil and grape vine tomatoes. We ordered this to try the Barretta cheese. The crust was soft, fresh and airy. I never had a soft crust like this one.   They offer a aariety of gelato flavors. I got the tiramisu and vanilla. Everything was great except for the fact that they gave 75% vanilla and 25% of tiramisu instead of half and half. That was disappointing since I was expecting equal quantities of both.   I recommend this place if you are looking for some fresh flavorful pizza and of course their famous gelato is worth the visit.",

The carne e fromaggio appetizer is good; the bread that comes with the meats, cheeses, and arugula plate is nicely toasted without being so crisp that it falls apart. Their pizzas are hit or miss, and light on the toppings in my opinion, but still make for an enjoyable meal.   Off of the pizza menu, I've had the Prosciutto and Pizza Roberto. The Pizza Roberto, in my opinion, is not worth the try (or price)... the home made burrata cheese makes the pizza watery and soggy. Do yourself a favor - save $7 and get the Margherita pizza instead. Luckily I used an online voucher deal during the meal that I ordered the Pizza Roberto, so the disappointment wasn't too damaging.",

    "text": "Frozen treat are good, especially during the hot summer months.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for a crushed-ice (like Rita's), regular ice cream, or gelato.  I have to admit, I've only had gelato a handful of times... it's good, but much different from ice cream.    How does gelato differ from regular ice cream?  Butterfat.  Gelato has lower butterfat content, and is also churned a little slower, making it denser than ice cream.   It had been some time since I enjoyed a cup of gelato, so while in Shadyside, I stopped into Mercurio's on Walnut Street.    Gelato is usually served from rectangular stainless steel containers.  There were many flavors to choose from at Mercurio's; (fresh fruit choices looked especially good) I decided on chocolate.  The dessert was served in small cup with a teeny spoon.  My first bite was good- the flavors were intense, and the texture was smooth.  The difference from regular ice cream was clear; it wasn't as creamy.  Verdict  Gelato is a traditional Italian dessert that is meant to be consumed in small portions. My gelato was excellent- prepared by ice cream artisans with great care.  It's slightly-less creamy texture could be the perfect finish to a delicious meal.  Since butterfat runs my veins in abundance, I'll stick with ice cream.",

Even better, it's awesome to finish your delicious meal with some perfect gelato. The consistency here is excellent. We love this place!  GLUTEN-FREE PIZZA Update: I've missed the pizza with the gluten allergy so I was extremely excited about the gluten-free pizza. Available on Mondays and Tuesdays. It's nearly impossible to get good gluten-free baked goods, and pizza is one of the hardest. I've heard Mercurio's has worked to perfect the recipe, but it wasn't quite right. Unfortunately, the extremely thin layer of toppings and liquidy sauce they use for the regular pizzas just do not work with this crust. As soon as it starts cooling, it's gets watery and rubbery and between bites of toppings, there's too much exposure to the crust. I hope they keep working on it because I'm still looking for good gluten-free pizza.",

    "text": "Neopolitan pizza is not like other pizza, so Mercurio's food will not suit everyone.  That being said, the pizza tastes exactly as Neopolitan ought to--chewy in the middle and browned /crispy on the crust.  It's light on the cheese and toppings, so it tastes much healthier than other pizza.    I've had the Fungi, Primavera, Prosciutto, and Regina(?)/Bufalo mozzarella pizzas, and my clear favorite is the Regina/Bufalo mozzarella pizza.  Given how delicate and flavorful the Bufalo is, I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice if they allowed you to switch the house-made mozzarella with the Bufalo on other pizzas.  The simplicity--while usually delightful--can occasionally translate into blandness; for that reason, I like Il Pizzaiolo slightly more-- it has more options. Another thing that makes Mercurio's feel authentically Italian is the reasonably priced and tasty glasses of house wine.    I have to mention the Caprese and Prosciutto Paninis-- these are so big, filling, and flavorful, with gooey mozzarella and balsamic vinegar!  They come with a side salad or soup, so this is almost the better option if you're really hungry and wanting some melty comfort food.   Given that the restuarant has a popular gelato shop right in the middle of it, it's more of a lunch or a casual dinner place--don't go expecting an intimate, romantic setting.  If the hubbub bothers you, you can always wait a few minutes extra/ request a table in the back section away from the gelato line.  And Yeah; Dulce de Leche gelato is sooo delicious.    The more I have Mercurio's pizzas, the more I crave them.  I'm definitely trying the Pizza del Re next time.",

They have a large variety of flavors and you can also taste them before making your choice! They will also make a milkshake with the gelato if you want to.  A great place to get an ice-cream!   During the last years they have also created a nice restaurant.  Their wood oven made pizza is delicious.  Only catch is that the seating is limited so there can be a bit of a wait on busy nights.",

Although many of the complaints revolve around the price of the food served here, I did not feel the costs were extraordinary.  I did, however, feel the food was mediocre.  I ordered the portobello salad that amounted to a huge over-salted pile of arugula with a measly mushroom on the side.  I also ordered the meat and cheese plate, which was adequate.  But, when we asked the waitress what cheeses were on the plate (1) she did not know and had to ask the kitchen and (2) after she asked the kitchen, she claimed there were 3 cheeses on the plate.  There were not 3 cheeses on the plate.  There were also little things that the waitress did that suggested a lack of attention and experience.  For instance, we asked for 3 glasses for the wine carafe because one my friends is clearly pregnant.  She brought 4.   We arrived a little after 5 and were seating immediately by the gelato counter.  Initially this was fine; but as the night wore on, the counter became increasingly busy and we ended up with rear ends at the backs of our heads.",

The raspberry truffle was not as good - not much raspberry flavor and the truffles didn't have that distinct truffley texture.  Also, a medium is pretty big - even for me, a big girl with a big appetite and a major sweet tooth.  It may be because the density is higher than ice cream.  If you stick to a small, it's affordable.  (There is a $5 credit card minimum.)  It will be crowded on weekend nights because of the traffic for Girasole, but during the day on a Sunday it was practically empty.  There's a nice bench across the street to enjoy your treats and people-watch.  I will definitely keep returning to try as many flavors as my food allergies will allow.",

    "text": "There's no shortage of pizza places in Pittsburgh, but a friend and I decided to check Mercurios out because we saw that it had gelato as well--which would save us a separate trip to get ice cream or dessert.  Was a little disappointed, not gonna lie. It's pricey, and the pizza is pretty light. It tasted good enough, not the best thin-crust pizza I've had though. I don't mind spending a little extra for a great meal but both of us walked out feeling still a little hungry. Not really worth visiting if you're on a college student budget or with a college student appetite.",

    "text": "My husband swears by Mecurios. My only problem is that I want more generous sauce and toppings. We totally agree they make the best crust and are the experts when it comes to gelato!  Where they fall short is how much sauce or toppings they add to your pizza. For what they charge, I would expect more in spite of the fact that they say they are genuine Italian pizzas. Another problem is that you cannot order extra anything on your pizza.  We've eaten there at least 10 times and order the bruschetta and a pizza. The bruschetta is incredibly awesome. My fav is the lasagna pizza.  The pizza IMHO needs more everything. (Especially for the price!)",

We order the whole nine yards at this place and got out of there only spending $55-$60 (including tip)!    We started off with a White Riesling and a Stella beer with our Portabella Mushroom and Arugula Salad... This salad is by far the most simple yet detailed salad I've had. It's really earthy but in the best way. I say this because my beau def. isn't interested in 'earthy' food but he loved it as much as me!  Next we ordered our pizzas, our waiter recommended both these pizza's as his two favorites. Mine was a truffle mushroom and my beau's was the Porchetta!  Not greasy, all hand made and you can watch! Both pizzas were amazing but I can say that mine was the favorite. The pizza is def. not American and that's why I loved it.   After dinner we grabbed gelato which takes up half the restaurant! We both got the pistachio and it was a great sweet treat after all the flavors we enjoyed during dinner.    This place is a great place for dates... We were actually there again this past weekend! The people there are very welcoming and really make this spot a gem. The only down fall is the narrowness of the front of the place but that's because it's growing very popular now a days ;)  - Dating Kay",

    "text": "This review is based on the pizza.  I tried the Romana, and in my opinion it was not up to par.  The toppings weren't either flavorful enough or plentiful enough (either would work, and you CAN have one but not the other) to carry the overpowering taste of chewy bread that is the crust.  There was also a presence of a burned flavor over part of the pizza.  Mind you, the pizza was not burned - it actually looked well cooked, but this 'flavor of burned' flavor somehow came from some place and permeated the crust of this pizza.  Not the 'good burned' either, but rather the kind of bitter, acrid wet-wood-smoke taste.  I've eaten worse things, but I don't think I'll be back to Mercurio's for pizza.  The gelato looked good.  Service was friendly, and I don't knock the servers or wait staff for anything...  but to management:  One register, and shared with the gelato stand?  That's no good.  Also, I could tell there was an issue with organization.  Staff were good people, but there's something about the system in place which seems to cause unnecessary wait times, and some confusion.  If I factored in parking and trying to 'get there' on a Wednesday night, I'd take all the stars away, because while some people might like hanging out in that part of town, I found it to be a hassle.  I am NOT factoring that in to my rating (2 stars for the food...  taste vs. expectations, period, and for me it was as I mentioned sub par this night).  I had to take multiple turns and avoid or accommodate negligent pedestrians left and right, and finally parallel park, which I guess in the city just means 'park'.  When it comes to food, I would like to order food, go to pick it up, park, and do that.  Here, I had to search for parking, and it wasn't a pleasant experience.  I'll walk a couple of blocks, but this was ridiculous.  Compared to other places I've been to and done this in Pittsburgh, this ranks high on my 'most annoying to get to' list.  In short, if you want pizza, there has got to be a better way to get what will probably be better pizza.  That's what this review is about.  No hard feelings.  Thanks for showing me what you got, and if I ever come back it will be for ice cream (or gelato, and I'll be holding up the register for frustrated call in pizza orderers and dining room guests...)",

The young guy working the counter seemed friendly enough but there was a very young, thin brunette wandering aimlessly while the line stood waiting to place their order.  She walked away and then returned, still unsure about what she could be doing.  She made eye contact with the lady in front of me, so she must have felt pressured to take her order.  She gave her a cone and then returned to her aimless wandering.  I'm not sure what she is being paid for, maybe she just volunteers, in that case, she should go to the back because it's irritating to customers when what looks like an employee is just doing \"nothing\".    There seemed to be a lack or organization or anyone taking charge making decisions about how to help the customers.  The two blond girls were busy working, the young guy, I mentioned earlier, and an older guy, maybe the owner, or manger seemed much more organized.  I would come back here because the ice cream is good and the size options are great but the customer service is questionable.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by some fellow yelpers so I gave it a try. Along with the livingsocial deal that I purchased for half off. It was a good deal too spend $10 get $20.  So the atmosphere is very italian with a lovely wooden floor and tables. The menu was a traditional one with the titles of the foods written in Italian. We sat directly outside the oven with a glass window covering the view of the pizza making process. We ordered a funghi pizza to share along with a house salad all for $20 bucks. The salad was tasty with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing and a delicious piece of toast along with the tastiest cherry tomatoes i've ever had.   So some of the things I disapproved of here was the climate in the building. It felt like it was 60 degrees forcing me to keep my coat on the entire time. The pizza had a great crust but the toppings were not that tasty and were very watery. On a thin crust pizza, a pool of water is the last thing you want. It was like eating a bread soup bowl. I think it's because of the water in the veggies and cheese but there has to be a way to fix that problem. After finishing our pizza we decided to grab some delicious looking gelato.  Even though it was 20 degrees out we ordered the ice cream. I grabbed 3 different flavors on a sugar cone which ended up being about $5. Somewhat disappointing because the cone was so small. I chose apple pie, somoa and blueberry cheescake. The blueberry cheesecake was definitely my favorite even though I was sure I would prefer the apple pie. The samoa was great too, tasted just like the girlscout cookie with a decent coconut flavor.  Our total bill was about $30 including tip which was ok but I wished the pizza would have been worth the $10 i paid for it. I don't know if I will be coming back here for the pizza but I will definitely return for some gelato.",

    "text": "The pizza here is very idiosyncratic; let me explain. The mozzarella is housemade. I could taste that the dough was housemade too. It was very soft, almost pita like, yet it retained char from the brick oven giving it a smoky taste. Simply, a unique crust. The tomato sauce tasted fresh and unique too. If I was a betting man, I'd wager that the tomato sauce is housemade too. I'll also mention that most of (if not all of) the pies cost $15 or less. The quality certainly places Mercurio's pies in Pittsburgh's elite class of pizza..  Now the gelato. There are about forty flavors. I settled on the Salted Caramel Truffle. Honestly, I felt like I was in a TV commercial for ice cream as I enjoyed it. The base was luscious and creamy. The gooey caramel and the crisp chocolate truffle bites created for textural contrast. Altogether, it was rich and delicious, yet not overbearing.  A few final points: The service here is very fast; I sat near the oven and witnessed my pizza being taken out of the oven and brought to my table within a minute. The waitresses were very attentive. I also liked the atmosphere. The staff seemed to enjoy working there. There were small subtleties which indicated that this was clearly a small business striving to offer a completely gratifying experience.They also have several beers on tap (Peroni, New Castle, Stella, and a seasonal draught which was North Country Brewing Co.'s Buck Up Black Pale Ale - a beer from Slippery Rock) - all of which were $5 or less.  Mercurio's does not settle on quality.",

    "text": "I am a bread/pizza crust/foccacio loving fool.  When I was younger, the thicker the crust, the more I loved the pizza.  I used to actually ask family members if they were going to eat their crusts and if not, could they give me their crusts. Weird, I know...  But a sea change occurred quite a few years ago.  One of my cousins mentioned that she didn't like thick crust pizza anymore and went on to describe why she didn't like thick crust anymore.  Well, that did it for me.  I know no longer like thick crust pizza. (Side note:  I used to also like huge chicken wings, but I no longer like them because of the way my aunt described why she no longer likes big chicken wings.  Hmmm, the power of suggestion.)  Anyway, Mercurio's pizza is the answer to me not liking thick crust pizza anymore.  I have been to Mercurio's several times and went initially at the suggestion of fellow foodie, Tim. W.  My daughter Muff had never been there, so we ordered the classic Margherita for her and I ordered the Italiano Panini sandwich with Capicola and salame, tomatoes, provolone, onion and extra virgin olive oil.  The sandwich was also served with a small side salad with small chunks of house made fresh mozzarella. I shared a portion of my Panini sandwich with my daughter, Muff and she shared a portion of her pizza with me.  Ah, the pizza crust had a nice chew and held up the toppings nicely, but I also felt like I could devour an entire pie without feeling weighted down.  There must be some sort of alchemy that occurs when a well-made dough hits a wood fired oven.  The Itailiano sandwich had just the right amount of high quality ingredients and everything was well balanced in this sandwich.  There's nothing like eating a sandwich where the dressing is overly assertive, or the meat is plentiful but inferior or the bread doesn't stand up to the fillings. Yum, yum, yum!   We didn't get any gelato this visit (I didn't want to drive all of the way across town with melting ice cream) but I have had it on previous visits it's deliciously sinful.  I must take Muff back for the gelato as she is a ice cream/gelato, Italian ice junkie.  I just wanted to get home quickly and be at one with my food because the wonderful weather that day made parking a contact sport.  I felt like a gerbil just circling round and round Shadyside.  However, if you get the chance to eat in, do so and just relax.  You may not want to linger too long, however, because the place gets crowded and other patrons will stare at you if you stay too long.  High quality ingredients prepared with extra care in an inviting space is treat that everyone should enjoy.",

My dad loves gelato, and when I first tested this place out, I told him he had to try it.  Being the wonderful daughter I am, we hiked South Negley to get over to Walnut street.  The gelato is around $.71/ounce, and they have three different size cups.  The employees are really great about listening to how much you want too, which is nice.  I love the mint chocolate chip, lime, and tiramisu!  All safe choices.  Make sure to sample flavors if you aren't sure what you want.  The pizza is also delicious.  The white pizza ($11) is good, but the prosciutto pizza ($14) is my favorite.  These pizzas are personal sized, but I could split one with a friend and order gelato for a full meal.  The only downside to this place is that the service is pretty eh at the tables.  Not bad but not good either.",

    "text": "Best brick oven pizza in Pittsburgh. I have eaten @ Mercurios many times and everything I've gotten has been so delicious. Every time my husband & I split the house salad, pesto pistachio pizza & one of their pizzas. The house salad is perfect, it has fresh house made mozzarella, shaved Parmesan & just the right amount of dressing. I absolutely love the pesto pistachio pizza. It's so original, I've never had anything like it anywhere else. I've tried about 4 or 5 different pizzas & they are all very good! My favorite one is the Olive.  Also love their gelato. There's about 30 different flavors to choose from. My only complaint is the staff puts away the gelato before closing time. So if you eat there close to closing time don't plan on being able to get any gelato after your meal because it'll be all packed up & put away. Nothing should be put away until all customers are done eating or gone. I think that's only courteous.   I highly recommend eating @ Mercurios you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I have adored Mercurios, their family story of learning the trait of gelato and the success over years growing from their former shadyside location over Girasole restaurant to the corner of Walnut and Filbert street. They recently [within the new location] have expanded into woodfired Pizzas, something I am in sore need to trying, but right now we will talk about Gelato.  Gelato, the real stuff not the crappy Rita's version, when done right, is a form of art. Not only must you source your ingredients with great care and combine flavors for unique tastes, you must cream it just right, giving it a density and hardness that will slow the melting process but also soft enough to easily scoop into your cup or homemade waffle cone. If you ever make it to the annual SIGEP Rimini Gelato and Confetionary Convention or watch it's documentary you will understand the art that goes into this wonderful desert. And Mercurio's does it well.   Not only do they offer a daily assortment of around 30 gelatos and ices at once, they rotate frequently from standard staple chocolate, the better Death-by-Chocolate to American favorite creations such as Strawberry Cheesecake or Turtle. The baristas [I guess that is what I would call them] are friendly and efficient and will gladly serve you little spoonfull in case you cannot make up your mind.  Next, they make milkshakes. OMG too amazing, they are liquid crack. but incredibly filling, so beware and save for a very hot day.   Additionally, I love that the gelato is offered by weight, something that bothers me about other places in the city where you can get a spoon full or gallon serving depending on who sits behind the bar at that point in time, making the whole experience very affordable when you just want a little bite or treat on a hot Summer Day.  I cannot wait to come and try out their Pizza one day so I can judge this establishment in it's entirety.",

The girl dropped one of the slices of bread from our salad onto the table and did not bring us a fresh slice. Our server wasn't rude exactly but I just got the vibe that she was bored and had no interest in being there.   The food is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars. The bruschetta was delicious, as was the house salad. The pizza was pretty good although I much prefer Piccolo Forno in Lawerenceville. Piccolo Forno has better pizza and service.   On a separate occasion we went for gelato. It's overpriced but it brought back memories from my semester in Italy so if was worth it.",

Their pizza however, is not for me. I should've looked at the pics before ordering. The toppings are mostly centered in the middle of the pie, where you get a few really good bites and that's it. I tried the margherita, which is so highly touted, and the mushroom, which were just button mushrooms. They did not have flavor. The mozzarella had no flavor! It was bland, and needed salt, and it was placed so sparingly and thinly on the dough. There's so much dough to get through, as compared to the actual toppings of the pizzas. I get that neopolitan style pizzas traditionally aren't loaded to the gills, but still, this was hard to appreciate. I ordered the one to go, and I'm not far from here so was able to eat it while still hot. The dough was tough and chewy, too much for my taste, which means it was overworked. I recommend ordering in advance for pickup. I know they're popular for their pizzas, and I always see tables full of people enjoying them. But I'll just stick to their gelatos.",

All the food was so good during the event that I've gone back quite a few times since.   They offer amazing Neapolitan style pizza, salads and gelato. Our favorite pizzas are the Pizza Del Re (House made mozzarella, truffle spread, mushrooms, Prosciutto di Parma, extra virgin olive oil) and the Quattro Formaggi (Mozzarella di bufala, fontina, parmigiano, provolone, extra virgin olive oil)  The space is small so a lot of times there will be a wait, especially on the weekends so use the No Wait App. Also be sure to download the free Loyal Tree App for your smart phone to get a free gelato when you join the Mercurio's loyalty program. You'll even earn points with each visit and be rewarded with cash back to spend at Mercurio's.  The gelato is just as good as the pizza. My favorites are The Vanilla Custard, Dulce De Leche and Strawberry Cheesecake. Thank God for my waistline that this place didn't exist when I lived in Shadyside!   Service is always great as well.",

Obviously Mercurio's is known for their pizza and while I find it to be tasty and good, I'm not over the moon about it. I have tried the margherita, margherita with bufala, lasagna and something with prosciutto on my various visits. Despite the overall pizza being 'just okay', I think the crust is fantastic--slightly sweet, fresh and chewy without sitting in a blob in your stomach.

Their crust is wood fired and their ingredients are extremely fresh. The pizza we got Is the Bianca, what typically is a Margarita. Very fresh, thick and juicy tomatoes, nice cheese and topped with basil and garlic. I would say it's one of the best \"pure\" pizzas I've had. The Gelato tasted just as good as what brought me here. I got the Black Cherry and it was awesome. For $17, we got a pizza to share and a Gelato. That is some good value",

Ever since last month's Yelp event, Under the Big Top, when I was introduced to Mercurio's pizza and gelato - I have heard nothing but good things. Friday night seemed like the perfect opportunity to check it out in person.  We ordered 2 pies: The Bianco and the Salsiccia e Funghi. Both pizzas arrived very quickly to our table, and slightly burnt. The ingredients were very fresh and light, however the pizza dough was a fluffy, naan-like consistency. It's not that the pizza was bad, but for the hype that has surrounded the pizza and experience, it was hardly remarkable. For all the Italian home style fan fare that you're presented with, you'll not find anything on the menu besides a few salads and pizza variations.   I was even more surprised that there wasn't a dedicated chef, but rather a few individuals and an enlarged convection oven. I am sad to say that I felt like there was more attention to detail at the previous Yelp event than at the restaurant itself.",

    "text": "Husband and I have been exploring Pittsburgh's unique neighborhoods, and last week it was time for Shadyside.  We visited on a whim one afternoon and ended up at Mercurio's for lunch.  My guy had been craving pizza, and I particularly like white pizza, so Mercurio's on popular Walnut Street fit the bill.  I enjoyed the Neapolitan white (\"bianca\") pizza we ordered.  At $10 the price was right, though a few more slices of tomato and some more basil leaves would have been nice.  I tend to like thin crust that's more doughy than crisp, and for me there was just the right amount of crispiness and black at the edge of the crust.  Those who prefer a firmer crust would probably be disappointed to some degree, and that likely explains why my husband didn't like the pie as much as I did.  A nice surprise here was the affordable wine selection.  We selected and really enjoyed a $22 bottle.  Cute place with a nice atmosphere, and there's seating inside and out.  Beautiful stone pizza oven with a tiled exterior.  Service was smiling, efficient, and attentive.  The area near the front door is mostly dedicated to gelato, and Mercurio's boasts quite a few flavors--at least a couple dozen, I'm sure.  After we explored Walnut Street and nearby Ellsworth Avenue we ended up back at Mercurio's so my guy could grab some gelato, which he really liked, incidentally.  I thought it was odd, however, that the gelato cups come in sizes yet customers are charged by the ounce?  This is not serve-yourself gelato, and in my opinion if sizes are offered the customer should pay by the size.  Makes me wonder if the owner/management doesn't trust employees to scoop properly.  I don't know; it just rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, sort of like bars that have measuring guns.  Would return for the pizza and wine.  Panini on the menu also caught my eye.",

One couple also got a salad to share. That way we all had room for gelato, which was also light and flavorful. I found the pizza menu difficult to read, because each pie differs from its neighbor very slightly; I wish they had just listed the unique topping instead the whole list of 4-5 ingredients that differed only at the end. If anything, the gelato list is even more impressive, with quite a number of different chocolate flavors: we tried the death by chocolate, raspberry truffle, black cherry chocolate, and molten lava. Besides the confusing pizza menus, minus half a star because we had to wait quite a while for a server to even come by to get our drink orders. It seemed like he might be the only waiter; they really needed to have another server for the size and busyness of the restaurant, which includes outside tables in good weather. Nevertheless, we will most likely be back.",

For drinks, my husband and I got the house red wine...$18 for a carafe (~6 glasses). This wine isn't overly complicated, but it's a nice light red which is a nice accompaniment to the meal.  We started with the house salad...a sizeable salad with mixed greens, grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, parm, and a homemade vinegarette dressing. The salad is served with 2 crostini, which are toasted with olive oil and a rub of garlic. I'd dare say this salad is the best starter salad I've ever had (and I get it every time we visit this restaurant).   I order the margherita pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Simple, yet delicious. They make their pizzas in a wood fire grill, making a nice char on the thin crust pizza. Pizzas are individually sized and can be eaten all at once or make for a delicious leftover snack later.  Finished with a small mint chocolate chunk gelato...what a perfect finish to a perfect meal!  Until next time!",

My wife loves the insalata della casa, and I enjoy their fresh cheese on the caprese, but I wouldn't necessary recommend either. I go straight for the pizza.  My favorite pizza is the marinara. As much as I love cheese, there's something about their sauce that keeps bringing me back to their most basic offering. I've had the margherita, salsiccia, and the pizza Roberto, too...all delicious (although the burrata is almost too much for me on the Roberto...you better be craving cheese for that one)! Their crust is perfection and the pizzas are a good size for an individual. I never feel miserably full after eating their pizza, either, which is a great thing...because...gelato!   Mercurio's has an excellent variety of gelato flavors to explore, and I've never really been disappointed. There are flavors that I've enjoyed more than others, but that's purely subjective. The freshness and wonderful texture of gelato has never let me down. My personal favorites are dulce de leche and samoa. Samoa is my go-to, but the former is a solid backup selection when the latter runs out.  The space is smal, so be prepared to be huddled up closely to other patrons. You're also guaranteed to leave smelling like waffle cones and pizza, so be happy it's a casual place. It gets really busy in the evenings and weekends, but the wait isn't usually too long. You can always get the No Wait app and get in line ahead of time if you're hoping to avoid a long wait.",

    "text": "fruity, decadent, and bursting with flavor, oh my!  mercurio's, modestly tucked away in a little nook, is pretty sweet (no pun intended..okay maybe).  upon entrance, you are greeted with colors that razzle, dazzle, and entice you, along with a friendly staff. the gelato all looks so good that you can't help but ask to sample a few. and sample a few i did.  i flirted with the cinnamon bun for a while, and it was incredible, but also incredibly rich. the mango was good, but they went the sweeter route when i was more interested in a tangy one. the pistachio was creamy and not too sweet--just the way it should be.  after all was said and done, i decided i wanted a medium cup that consisted of one fruity and one rich gelato. cue pink guava and gianduia (a sweet chocolate that contains about 30% hazelnut paste..think a light and fluffy nutella). it didn't matter what flavor you picked..the gelato was the same consistency as the gelato i had in piazza navona. pink and brown is a good combination on its own, but the flavors worked surprisingly well together. the heavier gianduia was balanced by the pink guava, which made me nostalgic as it reminded me of the philippine pomelo. sinful yet refreshing.  at 62 cents an ounce, my medium cup (which is 5-8 ounces generally) came to about $3.50. i took a star off because i happened to get the coagulated, thick top part of the gelato that has a texture similar to a cheap sugary bubblegum that you can't fully enjoy. in the scheme of things, that top part is so tiny compared with the rest of the gelato you get, and if i'm ever back in the 'burgh, i'll be hitting up mercurio's for a new creative pairing.",

    "text": "Decided to wait out rush hour here tonight. Nice staff. My BF and I shared the Primavera Con Carne and the Pizza Del Re.  Both were good Neapolitan style pizzas.  I am not very partial to white button mushrooms, so I had to ask the server about the mushrooms on the Del Re.  They were white button, but the pizza was still awesome.  The truffle spread was RICH!  I personally don't recommend eating the Del Re by yourself.  Don't get me wrong, I'd order it again in a heartbeat..... but it would just be too much by itself.  Doing a salad and half this pizza for two people would be the right amount.  Or like I did, mixing in the Primavera Con Carne which had the acidity from the tomato sauce and the marinated artichokes to cut the heaviness of the Del Re.  We finished with a sweet and creamy, yet tart acidity Key Lime Pie gelato, which was heavenly.  The girl behind the counter said that she was happy that I did a taste test of the key lime and liked it.  She said it was her favorite, but 90% of the time she recommends it, no one gets it.  So she just stopped recommending it.  Sometimes the best things are left undiscovered.  Leaves more for me :)   I will be coming back for your Key Lime Gelato.  It was a perfect ending to a rich and filling dinner.",

    "text": "Bob and I ducked into Mercurio's today after a long day of wandering around Shadyside.  We were stuffed from lunch but we ate a bit of gelato anyway, and here's why: one ounce is 64 CENTS.  My mind reeled as I took in the array of gelato tubs.  They have at least 24 flavors, more than I've ever seen at any other gelato place.  And all of them are made fresh locally!  I asked!  This is my absolute frozen dream.  Crazy variety, fresh, and CHEAP.  You can go in and ask for one ounce of five different flavors and end up paying under four dollars.  A quick comparison: a small size at Ben & Jerry's is 3.50-ish for four ounces, and you can only get two flavors per scoop.  Premium ice cream like Ben & Jerry's is made with heavy cream, and gelato is made with 2% milk at most.  This is why gelato equals more flavor (not as much butterfat coating your mouth) with fewer calories.  Yum.  I'm going back as soon as I can for a multi-flavor fix.  Today I tried pistachio and chocolate almond (for a total of 1.85), and they were both excellent.  I'm only getting started though.  There are enough delicious things in Mercurio's to keep me busy for a long, long time.",

My personal favorite flavor is the strawberry cheesecake gelato but unfortunately it's hardly ever on rotation.  I keep going back for more of it with limited success.  Mango, key lime and peanut butter are almost as equally delicious and those aren't even their \"bestsellers.\"  They have so many flavors to choose from that you'll have to go back to try them all!  It's a little more pricey than your typical ice cream but it's well worth the extra cost.  I always go with the small size and it's just enough to quench your craving without making you feel guilty.  You know it's good when you're trying to find excuses to stop in Shadyside so you can swing by and grab a cup of gelato when you live in the North Hills!",

The mushrooms were also perfectly cooked and were nicely distributed over the pizza. I also appreciated that the pizza wasn't overly oily, like I find so many Margheritas tend to be. On the negative side, I thought the crust was extremely doughy. It was thin enough in the middle of the pizza so the doughiness wasn't as noticable, but the outer crust was super thick and doughy. The crust didn't have much flavor and was not the crisp chewy crust you'd expect to find with a Marghertia pizza. It was also on the salty side. Further, I wasn't quite sure, but the overall pizza was extremely salty. Nothing besides the crust tasted overly salted alone, so I'm guessing too much sea salt was sprinkled over the pizza.  Aside from the food, our waitress was also very standoffish which was annoying.",
