The Evelyn's pasta, though, was undercooked and mixed with charrred eggplant.",

The service was all you could wish for, the atmosphere is chain, the cheese cake looked good.  I chose a healthy chopped vegetable salad that was meh, fine. I can't even find descriptive words for it. It was as if on a lazy day I cleaned out the fridge of bits and ends of cooked and raw veggies. Mostly lettuce, huge bowl, couple chunks of asparagus, unexceptional dressing, a couple pieces of beet, a handful of good cheddar chunks on the top for $10 without chicken.    For $12 I could have gone to Mad Mex and had a similarly large salad with lots of grilled chicken and a spicy sauce, for $7.50 I could have had a homemade Thai soup with drunken noodles at Red Orchid.  I will never willingly go here again.",

Ordered drinks and food at the same time. Waiter came back with water and stated for the second time you need utensils we are not barbarians!!! Drinks came out in a timely fashion, my husbands food came out first and I was told \"yours will be right out honey\"  7 min later our waiter came to check on us and said oh you don't have your meal let me check in that!! 5 minutes later I recorded my meal.   We were not checked on again until we were done eating!! Never going back!!!!  What once was a decent place to grab a bite has gone downhill!!!",

It's a little out of the way, so if I weren't at the mall already I probably wouldn't battle traffic to venture up to the hill top mall area just to dine here.  That said, mall parking is free and if you're shopping there anyway (especially during the holidays), it's nice not to have to pack up the car and relocate once you are finally done or need to refuel before getting another fix of your shop-till-you-drop addiction.  The curbside-to-go service makes this a nice addition to the North Hills shopping experience, so you might want to jot down their number and pocket a to-go menu (or visit their website) and call in an order before heading home.",

I do not like cheesecake but we gave it a try for lunch. We waited a bit long to be seated. The cake display was nice. The seating arrangement is tight. To close to the stranger next to ya. I ordered shrimp scampi. This is my favorite dish. I was so disappointed . My shrimp was rubbery and bland. The plating was sad. There was 5 medium sized shrimp around a pile of dry tasteless pasta. Seriously! For almost $20.00 you need to receive a really fantastic lunch. It was our birthday celebration so I did not mention this to our party of 4. If I would of been with my husband or my son I would of ask to see the chef. The look of the place and staff has that going for it but the food sucks.Our waiter was super nice and easy on the eyes. If the reputation your going for is a respectful, pleasantly clean higher end restaurant you need to follow through with a chef that cares about how his food taste and looks. Yes you go to your favorite place because of the staff I get that but the food is the whole reason from the start.",

    "text": "There's nothing new to be said about The Cheesecake Factory itself - yes it's a big expensive chain (with advertising on every page of their menu). Granted.  Since Ross Park Mall is now revitalized with upscale stores, you're limited to the Cheesecake Factory for upscale eating (who wants to shop at Tiffany's and then go to a crowded foodcourt?), aside from the crowded cafes at Nordstroms.  During peak shopping times (Anytime on Weekends) be aware of the very long wait ahead of you - an hour, probably. It's going to be busy. However, the vibrating reservation gadgets work all over the mall, so if you're in for a day of light \"do-as-you-please\" shopping or you're only there for one stop it may be a good idea for you to grab a reservation before you start out into the mall.  Cheesecake Factories are probably the same expensive, yet delicious, food all over the country. You get what you pay for - especially in the case of the Ahi Carpaccio. It MAY (a HUGE may) rival Nobu for the special place in my heart reserved for raw tuna.   I'm generally unimpressed by their very large salads and pasta dishes. The real stars at The Cheesecake Factory are the appetizers and the cheesecakes themselves. You can never go wrong with the cheesecake varieties. The slices are pretty big, and you may be stuffed from all the food, so it's good to know that they can very neatly split one slice up for two people.  A word on the beers: currently they have Blue Moon, Yuengling, and... I'm blanking on the last one. (It's not Guinness, and that's all I care about.) They have many different bottles, in addition to pricey cocktails and wine.",

We ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer; a bit on the disappointing side. The chips were nice and crispy, but a little over-salted. I went with something I knew was good there...the Herb Encrusted Salmon with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes (ha I write it like it's a move title). Anyways, it never fails to disappoint! They cooked the salmon medium rare (the way it SHOULD be cooked!) and the lemon butter sauce gave a nice sour edge to the entire meal. The decor is nice and laid back, although the lighting gets to be a bit too dim by the end of the night, at least in our section. Sometimes I feel like they crowd their menu a bit too much thus serving a lot of so-so dishes. They could benefit from a good spring cleaning of the menu :)",

    "text": "It's taken me forever and a few years to write a review for The Cheesecake Factory at Ross Park Mall.  I guess it's because I don't really understand the love and the appeal.  This place is almost always packed!!  I also don't really understand how they can have such a large menu that covers almost every type of food there is and get everything right.  And that's because they don't.  Even so, the masses flock to this place like bees to a hive.  It should be the ultimate place to dine while at the mall!  Beautiful interior, soaring ceilings, custom painted fancy columns, dark wood booths.  Service is friendly and generally spot on.    Back to the menu (complete with advertisements, am I the only one that finds this so tacky?), you can get pizza, pasta,(including jambalaya style) seafood, steaks and chops, salads, sandwiches, burgers, omelets and Sunday Brunch.  For beverages, they serve wine, beer, cocktails, frozen drinks, espresso, milkshakes.  Again, you want it, they got it.    Quantities can sometimes be too large.  I got a salad here one time that was so big it was almost embarrassing.  I could not longer see my date over my salad.  It was more greens that I could eat in one week.  Oh, and the cheesecake.  The choices here are also over the top and decedent.  But really, who has room left for dessert?  Of course, they are more than happy to bag it up for you to take out.  A recent addition that is making me like them more is The SkinnyLicious Menu.  Again, an overkill with all the choices.  And you will never get skinny eating these meals, but it is a vast improvement over their regular fare.",

The waiter was nice, but you can tell he gets irritated when we ask questions since it was so busy and he prob had other things he needs to do...we had the eggroll sampler, the chicken sandwich and pineapple shrimp, and my daughter really liked her bowtie alfredo. All the food was great with generous portions, next time i go i will be sure to make a reservation",

I'm guessing the new one comes straight from a freezer to the microwave to your table which is the reason for the change.  The previous dish was beautifully prepared.  I liked it so much I had most of my family ordering it as well.   Lastly, I've enjoyed some very nice meals at the bar.  Can't recall the gal's name but she is a gem and I've gone back just because of her.   I'm going to give 4 stars as I think you do a good job but you have to fix that eggplant dish.",

We got two dishes and split them because that's how we do!  We ordered the Herb-crusted Salmon (with asparagus and seasoned green beans) and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.    Both were delicious.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the accompanying sauce was ri-DIC-ulous. The green beans were slightly salty but the asparagus was on point!  The pasta was effin' yummy.  The coating on the chicken was thin and crispy, and the pasta was al dente (hell yes!).    As always, portions were HUGE - def. enough for a second lunch, ha!  Oh, and the bread here was really good!  It came out totally fresh - warm bread FTW.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  I'll DEFINITELY be back again.  FYI:  it gets crazy busy here so there's usually a wait.  Just a heads up in case any of ya'll are in a rush!",

The food was delicious.  Love the honey wheat bread with the oats! She stayed ahead of our drink refills which made me happy. The hibachi steak melts in your mouth.  The shrimp bacon club sandwich was the size of my husband's head.  The booths are also amazing because theyre technically for 6 so a family of 4 has plenty of room!

The menu was so long and almost daunting. I ended up going with my safety and ordering the Pit Dip, which was alright, but nothing special. A little too sticky and there were odd bits of lettuce in the cheese (when the sandwich does not contain lettuce). Wasn't a fan. The fries were OK, but considering I paid $15 for my lunch, I expected something a little better.   I'm not sure if the massive menu is just their thing or not, but it made things harder than they needed to be for decent quality food that definitely wasn't worth the money.",

He went over the menu and asked if we had any questions as I had never been there before.  I told him it really wasn't necessary because even though I hadn't been there before, I was far from unprepared.  He then went on to tell is, \"It's going to be a good day\" and how he picks one day every three weeks or so and decides it's going to be his birthday.  I like the way he thinks.  It felt like MY birthday when my Morning Quesadilla arrived.  There were so many goodies in there, I couldn't believe it.  And goodies on the side, too - heaping piles of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  So delicious.  I highly recommend.  I also ordered the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes because I've heard such good things about them.  They tasted almost as good as they smelled which was heavenly.  But after my quesadilla I was only able to eat a portion of the pancakes, even when assisted by my friend.  I took home the leftovers and they were still delicious the next day.  I also ordered a piece of Godiva cheesecake to go.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a piece of their cheesecake and this was some chocolatey goodness.  The place was hopping when we left, so I would recommend getting there early (i.e. when they open) to enjoy the brunch menu.",

Then it comes out with heavy cream in it and no mention of this on the menu! Shrimp Scampi states garlic, lemon sauce and splash of marinara added at the end! The Shrimp was not sauteed, but cocktail shrimp with tails on and bowl of Marinara and a dry pile of Angel Hair on the plate. The Chicken Madeira has cheese on it and served with DUMB smashed potatoes! This is not traditional as Cheese should be optional and Rice or pasta should be offered for all the saute dishes. The last gripe is the Glasses for cold beverages. A glass is nice for a cold Coke, but these glasses that you use SUCK! They must be from the early glass making days. Heavy and awkward. Time to get a real Glass to put cold beverages in 2018. The Cheesecake, especially the Choc chip cookie dough would be GREAT, but some ASSHOLES KEEPS PUTTING NUTS IN THE RECIPE!

We ordered steak tacos for me and bang bang chicken and shrimp for him.  When the food came my steak was undercooked, not pink but red in the center!! Some pieces looked almost raw!! Not what I was expecting. The waiter didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and I didn't remember to tell him either. So he took it to the kitchen and came back to say, it would take another 12-15 minutes!!! He offered me a side salad on the house.  In the meantime, my bf is chowing down on his food that was cooked correctly. I ended up eating some of his while I was waiting. So finally by the time my food came back my bf was already done eating. The manager brought my food out and explained that he had it cooked well done. The tacos had a good taste but I only ate 2 of the 4 and asked for a box. After eating bread, the salad and some of my bf's food I wasn't too hungry at that point.  When the check came, it had 2 orders of steak tacos instead of just one. At that point I started to get pissed off by the whole experience. I told the waiter about the error and he corrected it. We had to wait a while before he came back with change. We won't be back to this location. We should have gone to the South Side, I think things would have been handled a lot differently there. I'm just happy my bf enjoyed his birthday meal even though it wasn't the most enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "This place used to be a 5 star dinner some few years back but not anymore.   In one occasion, I went with my wife (she loves Cheesecake factory) and the waiter was very busy and seemed exhausted. We asked for two entrees and for myself I choose to try the chicken and shrimp entree (it was new on the menu). When I unwrapped the napkin to get the fork and knife I noticed some sticky greenish stuff in between the teeth of my fork. My wife also noticed some sticky stuff on her knife. I knew it was not the waiters fault but called him and asked him to change the utensils. After some 20 minutes he came back with the utensils and the entrees followed. I looked at my dish and found it had no shrimp, only chicken and rice. I called him again and asked him \"Where is the shrimp?\". He looked at the dish then said \"the shrimp and the chicken are combined together\".... I took the knife and cut out one piece of chicken in to a half and asked him \"where is the shrimp now?\".  At this point I was very nervous and angry and asked him to call the manager. The manager came and he was a nice guy and insisted that he will change the dish and will not charge me for the entrees. I refused his offer and told him about the dirty utensils and that customers are not that dumb when the waiter says \"the chicken is mixed with the shrimp\". Took my wife and left to another place.  A year later, my wife asked me to go back. I did not want to but told my self \"things might have changed\". This time another waitress that can barely smile and busy as usual came after 15 minutes of being seated. We asked her for the bread and made our orders. The bread came after another 20 minutes and one of the plates was not what we ordered. Called her again and she apologized for the mistake. Another 15 minutes passed and the plate was served. Thus to start eating after being seated, it took 55-60 minutes!!!! I lost my appetite and asked her to pack the food, paid and left telling myself \"I am done with this place\".  I have been to many Cheesecake factory in different cities like Denver, Detroit, Charlotte, and Las Vegas. None of these is similar to the Ross Mall Cheesecake factory. If it was a scale from 1 to 5, these places I have mentioned are at 5 compered to this place which is at 1. Even the quality and portions are different, being better in the places I have mentioned.  Bottom-line, save your money and go find another decent place. Not worth it.",

The bread she said she would bring, we had to ask her for 30minutes later as we were starving. Our appetizer came but the main course which were salads took another 20minutes.

We tend to go to this restaurant and \"give it another chance\" but always leave very disappointed. Like tonight for example: it took 45 minutes on a not very busy evening just to get our entrees. Then we order cheesecake which takes another 20 minutes. The floors are like an ice-skating rink so slippery and the bathrooms are messy.

I don't come here often but when I do, I usually order the Cajun chicken pasta which has a thick spicy cream sauce, veggies & is topped with tortilla strips that add really nice texture to the dish. (I order it without chicken). The waitress brought it to the table & asked me to stir it & make sure there was no chicken, which I thought was really considerate because a lot of times people forget to not add meat to dishes. It looked fine (We sat outside & it was dark) but after she left I began to eat & the sauce was so thin & there was barely any of it in the pasta, so it was pretty flavorless. I was really disappointed in the execution. It's always been really consistent in the past. I'm sure I'll be back again & will order that dish again, but I'll make sure to ask them to ensure the sauce is creamy, as it should be.",

Will not be back, if ever trying to go to Cheesecake Factory the one in Southside is much more efficient.",

I had a hard time choosing what to eat but eventually settled on a chicken piccata dish. It was amazing, the lemon sauce was to die for, and it came with three huge chicken pieces. Finished up with a piece of Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Highly recommended!",

The chicken and asparag were very good but the mashed potatoes were crazy salty.  The very attentive waiter got us another serving of mashed potatoes which was just as bad.  The manager came to our table and agreed the potatoes were very salty.  Because of a heart condition I must watch my sodium intake.  I asked for a baked potato but they don't have any kind of baked potatoes which surprised me.  The waiter offered soup in place of the potatoes but all soups contain too much salt for me.  My wife did get the soup and it was a bit too peppery for her but she ate it.  When he bill came, we were charged full price for everything.  This after almost 2 hrs fro arriving til eating, not being able to eat one third of my meal, then paying $62 with tip, I was disappointed.  Couldn't care less if I go back there.",

    "text": "Ahhh the cheesecake factory. An absolute nightmare for indecisive people like myself. 3 menus (regular, special, and skinnylicious) for me to debate over until I just about give up and order something spontaneous because the waitress has visited my table 3 times now asking if I \"still need more time\". And that begins our tale. My fellow yelper Madilyn and I headed into the Cheesecake factory tonight with an open mind... Yet I felt my choices were still made poorly. ANYWAYS, I got chicken samosas as my starter - it was actually delicious. Super hot and crispy, well spiced, and the cilantro sauce was an excellent pairing. Reminded me of a good Indian restaurant. Okay so the entree is where I feel I made the wrong decision. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which was listed as being \"very spicy\". First off... not spicy at all. So that was disappointing. Also the pasta was definitely overcooked, WAY past al dente and starting to all stick together.. almost mushy. I think there were 4 pieces of small shrimp. It still had an OK flavor - just not what I was expecting for $19. Ended up taking most of it home. OH- I also got a moscow mule and an asian pear martini. The moscow mule didn't even come in a copper mug... I wish I took a picture to show how sad it looked but it wasn't even worthy of one. But I gotta say the pear martini was amazing. I'm still giving 4 stars because of the following reasons - friendly, attentive staff - nice atmosphere - extensive menu - great bread/butter to start - it was actually WARM inside compared to other restaurants i've been to lately. Always a pleasant experience, as I've been here many times before. Will surely be back.",

We laughed a lot with her and as a result we ran up a nice little bar tab with our meal.

My first recommendation is to get there when it opens otherwise you will be waiting quite some time for a seat.  Normally when I eat there I go for lunch since they serve huge portions. I normally order a lunch salad and it is so huge I really can't eat much more of anything else. They do serve two kinds of bread with your meal. My favorite is the brown bread with white seeds on top.  They do have various cheesecakes in a cooler case when you enter so you can see the various types. You can also purchase them for takeout. They are very filling but the are NY style. Believe me it isn't authentic but the next best thing to it.  I usually end up taking food home since they serve large portions. Keep in mind this is a chain restaurant and you can find it in various cities.",

Our server didn't show up for 10 minutes even though she passed our table several times without greeting us. Her affect and demeanor was flat and that persisted throughout our meal.  I wanted to say put a smile on that face!  My Wife ordered almond crusted salmon salad and it arrived without Brussels sprouts, quinoa, or arugula.  Just a big pile of kale and salmon.  We asked about it and she went and grabbed a menu to read what was supposed to come on the salad. It's like cmon we know what we ordered.  So she took the salad and came back with a question: do we want a new salad or just through the missing ingredients on the old one?? Are you kidding me??  I hate sending food back for fear of what they'll do to it but she couldn't eat that salad.  New one please.  My chicken wings were overpriced and undercooked.  $13 for 8 wings?? Of course on the menu they don't tell you how many you get so I assumed it was a dozen. Wrong.  Also the drink menu doesn't have prices either.   The ahi tuna appetizer was good and the Korean fried cauliflower was awesome.  They did comp us a slice of cheesecake for the salad mistake.  Oh and the floors were greasy and slippery. I almost fell when leaving.   Overall not a great experience for the price.  The waitress just didn't have the personality for this line of work.  And personality goes a long way especially when there's problems with what's being served.  We left a big tip on the gift card (that I bought) only because we're not coming back here again.  Just not worth the price or drive.",

Just a bit of advice... if you want to talk about a customer wait until they can't hear you or read your lips. They were rude. I called ahead asking if it would be busy, they said it shouldn't a problem. When we arrived they said it would take 2 hours for a table. My father in law went in no more than 15 minutes later and asked for Why two tables were empty and if we could just sit there. The hostesses rudely said yes and we were able to seat IMMEDIATELY. We sat down at the table around 6:45 and ordered the food around 6:50. My son got his food at 7:40 and IT WAS AFTER I had asked for it to be brought out as soon as possible. It was corn dogs and fries. There were several tables that sat before us and were served. We did not receive our food until 8:00. The food was cold and the salmon had MULTIPLE bones in it. One of our guests had to LEAVE without even being able to sit and eat because we had waited so long. She had to ask for it to be boxed. The manager didn't even say a word about it. The manager didn't even act like she cared and she looked disheveled. The standards at this restaurant are equivalent to a fast food restaurant, but with colder food. I will continue to tell everyone and anyone not to visit this location if they ever want to be satisfied. A waste of $110, while no one at the party got to eat a good and warm meal. We were disgusted.",

I was wary that with a 15 page menu featuring advertisements the food would not be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got some sort of Italian thing and it was quite good. It seemed fresh and made today, not freeze-dried.  The portions, like everything else in Pittsburgh food, are huge. So huge, we wound up getting our cheesecake to go to eat at home. Not a bad deal, but you'd want to eat it there considering it's called the Cheesecake Factory, not the Generic Styrofoam Take-Out Box Factory.

Ok now I ordered the sheperds pie while my mother got the lunch sized vegi pizza with salad my dad got the garlic noodles all the food was \"ok/good\" the garlic noodles were exceptional my shepherds pie was nothing to write home about tho, didnt get a chance to try moms pizza. Also be mindful that I have been here plenty of time and I can't stress this enough that the utensils were this dirty and service was horribly slow every single time.

I was in the mood for something spicy and this did the trick. It wasn't too hot where I was dying while eating, but good enough to get the kick. The chicken was so soft and the shrimp perfectly cooked. The linguine was really good too! Only thing was, it was a bit too oily and kind of heavy. (Sidenote: this dish only comes in full portion. I wish it came in lunch size because it's pretty big.)  My friend and I also split a chocolate raspberry cheesecake. At first it's really good! but then it gets to be a bit too rich for my taste. Same for her, because we couldn't even finish it. Also, we were really full.   I really enjoy coming here cause they have good food, but sometimes their food is a bit too heavy/rich for my taste and the waits are really long. Also, because there are so many people service can be a bit slow sometime. Not unbearably slow, but noticeably slow. No reservations either. So, yeah. But their bread is good! Always.",

    "text": "Mission: Lady Kay was owed an official belated St. Valentine's Day dinner. What did the dart land on? Cheesecake Factory. Wanting to avoid the wild, wooly South Side, we came all the way out to the Forbidden Land of Ross Park Mall.   Never before have I ever had to wait for over 2 hours to be seated anywhere. I was reluctant.  \"I didn't come all the way out here to eat in a damned mall food court,\" Kay snarled, her hunger making her into someone that was not my beloved.  \"But babe, I read that there's a Five Guys, and I always wanted to try...\"  I saw cat's eyes, angry cat's eyes staring back at me.   \"Ok, give me the glowing beeper,\" I said to the kid behind the desk.   And off to the Mall we went to burn extra time.   When we returned, we waited another 20 minutes, played peekaboo with a darling baby girl who was being held by her dad, and were then seated.   By this point we were becoming flesh-munching undead.   Cheesecake Factory has a bewilderdingly extensive menu despite being centered around their dizzying varieties of cheesecake.   They also appear to have a fixation on that mobster of the vegetable world; the avocado. It's in half their dishes, from app's to ent's.  They purport that their guacamole is as Sheetz sez, M-T-O. However, we already had something to tide us over at the mall, so we went straight for main courses.   I SO wanted to try that fresh guac though. So what did I do?  I got it on a burger. No questions asked by our adept server Vicki, no funny stares.   CF calls 'em Glamburgers, and like the cheesecake, there are many different kinds. You'd think they'd have voluminous, teased-up hair and a thing for cocaine and groupies.  Mine had American Kobe beef and came with grilled onions and mushrooms, but in addition to the guac, I got mayo, tomato, and lettuce, just to make it...rock.   And for the most part it did. It was served on a sweetly toasted and buttery sesame seed bun and came off like an Eat 'N Park Superburger that fell out of a limo and into a gutter wearing nothing but leather pants and boots.   I'd never had Kobe beef before, so here I was with a chance to try it. Now, it has been THE rage for a long spell. However, I also recall someone on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fseriouseats.com&s=3b052088318b4efbe6387034d6573c7062e3c7b2df89a7a3deb7620f31acda09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">seriouseats.com</a> saying that it tasted like cat food. Hmmm.  To my gaping maw, it was just a pretty damn fine burger. It wasn't as transcendent or ascendant as it had been hyped to be nor was it something passe as the Pitchforkesque foodies would have you believe. I mean, as a burger, this falls before the mighty Tessaro's or Cheeburger Cheeburger or Burgatory, but I can't say it would tap out easily. Pink inside, charred blacker than night on the outside, it makes a comeback before succumbing to an armbar in the 4th round.   NIIICE fries, guys, cooked twice 'cause they were illegally crispy/chewy. They come in a metal cup with an inlay of bakery tissue paper which I always find to be a cool, cool touch. The tin cup was HOT, though. Vicki told us she burnt her hand on it. Ow.  Shepherd's Pie. A fancy chain like CF happens to have it on their menu (what don't they have?). I've never had it before until last night when I sampled what Lady Kay ordered.   Thumbs up, dude. Mashed potato, minced meat, it all held together well like the Thin Lizzy of old used to (cue the harmonized axe licks). I felt the thick, succulent comfort, y'know?   Dessert would come next, and if the large selection of cheesecake flavors isn't plenty, they have sundaes, cakes, apple cobblers, tiramisu, and even a plain bowl of strawberries. Dilemmas afire!   Inspired by an ill-fated visit to the store of the same name, Kay got the Godiva cheesecake. Feeling Aquarian, I went against the grain and got  Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake, which contains a layer of their Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. Each is served with clouds of whipped cream and their fresh hot fudge (for extra $).   Eh. Now, I got a gander at their brothel of goodies in the foyer and was tempted, but my chocolate cake turned out to be as what my reg'lars know as a bimbo dessert; all looks, not enough taste. Not that it was horrid. It looked like a dominatrix with all those chocochips acting as studs and was impressive to behold overall. It had a hide like an armadillo in fact. Upon taking a bite though, I could tell that it had been sitting around a while after having been shipped in suspended animation. I can think of a number of indy bakeries in Pittsburgh that best CF at their own game, easily. Fresh is always better.   Kay's cheesecake was a little more interesting, but if Godiva chocolate is that unaffordable, then folks are gettin' swindled. It was chilly and errr...moussy in flavor with a bombastic presentation. Fine to look at, when you get to know her, you find you weren't missing out. The whipped cream was flat and the runny hot fudge only slightly less-so. Yeah, we thought the desserts would rawk too. Bummer.",

The woman took my order and told me it would only be about 15 mins. (I ordered 2 chicken salads and a piece of cheesecake).  I sat around for about 25 min. and was a little annoyed with the extra time because a large amount of the staff was standing around.  When my order came out, the woman who was at the bakery was easily the hardest working person at the time.  She was apologetic for my order taking extra time and gave me an extra piece of cheesecake at no additional cost.  I was very appreciative of this since I didn't ask for it.  She said it was the least they could do for making me wait longer.  We were very satisfied with this level of customer service.  Everything was good and we enjoyed our meal.    The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that this woman was killing herself at the bakery doing orders left and right while there were several other staff members standing around the bakery watching her work, not offering help, and at times they even seemed not aware that there were customers standing 5 feet away from them.",

I came back after that 45 minutes and gave my name and the lady had to go get someone and talked to her for about 5 minutes as if you there was something wrong. She then came back to me and told me that if I wanted to eat there it would be another 45 minutes. I waited an hour and a half just to be told that id have to wait for two and a half hours total to eat after driving an hour there.

I had the Mexican chicken salad. I guess I should not have been surprised that the salad portion was still huge. It had a fried tortilla on the bottom, lots of greens, tomatoes, grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and dressing. I wish there had been more chicken. My friend had the Tuscan chicken dish off the skinnylicious menu and still could not finish her portion. We then of course had to have cheesecake. My favorite is the mango key lime cheesecake, which has a nice coconut crust,key lime cheesecake, mango mousse, and mango glaze. It is creamy, but also very refreshing!

The food here is what I would call \"splurge\" food---it's really unhealthy and oily---but, if you're at the Cheesecake Factory, that's probably what you're going for anyway. As much as I love eating their super flavored, greasy food, sometimes it's just overpowering and makes me feel a sense of \"ugh\" inside. For example, I got their Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp, and as much as I love eating flavorful things, I thought that the meal was just really heavy for me at the end. Also, the crabcake appetizer I had was really heavy and I didn't know if I even wanted to eat my main entree. Other than the huge dump of calories in my body, I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The decor is Disneyworld-like and really gets you in the mood to have fun.  And oh yeah, please try the Cheesecake, it's something that you won't want to miss out on.",

We used curbsidePick up and although I wasn't there, was told it was very chaotic scene.   I've experienced the same situation in the past.  Not sure how you fix that, but it seems like you can't handle the volume of business you are trying to do.  The meals my family ordered were all pretty good according to them. I wasn't really hungry so I ordered the chicken wings appetizer and it was GOD AWFUL.  I really think they were cooked in the microwave the seasoning was pretty good but the texture reminded me of lousy pre-cooked wings from the freezer aisle of the grocery store.  I think most of their food resembles a high end TV Dinner.  I really don't understand the popularity of this place.",

    "text": "I went here on a Friday night with my wife and another couple.  I was expecting there to be a huge wait, but we were pleasantly surprised that it only took us 20 minutes to get a table.  The inside is impressively decorated and the lighting is a bit darker inside.   The menu is a bit overwhelming here.  Too many things to choose from, but in the same breath you can come back frequently and never get the same thing.  Everything on the menu sounded appetizing, and my wife and I settled on two different types of pasta.  Mine was supposed to be a spicier pasta, but it really didn't have much kick to it.  My wife liked hers which had peas, bacon, and Alfredo sauce. It wasn't anything spectacular but they do give you a healthy portion.  The bread that came with the meal was fairly good.  The couple we came split fried chicken and mashed potatoes as well as a salad.  I was a little more envious of their meal than mine.  For dessert, we had the Tuxedo cheesecake in a to go box which for sure exceeded my expectations.    Overall, this is a very expensive place to go eat at.  Our meal was around $60 for 2 dinners and a dessert.  I'm not opposed to come back, but if I'm going to spend $60 for dinner I will go somewhere nicer.  I think the menu does have items that are reasonable and that I would look to get if I end up going here again.  The cheesecake is for sure excellent, so I wouldn't hesitate to stop in to pick up dessert sometime.",

I walked away so as not to cause a scene and she came after me yelling at me we are only 6 minutes behind. I explained that wasn't my issue her team took the identifier and never addressed the real issue. The battery was dying!  They in fact had still not called us to be seated.

    "text": "I have been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and I left truly disappointed.   My wife and I had a rare Saturday night to ourselves so I decided to take her out to eat after putting up with me at the Nordstrom Anniversary sale. Once we arrived there was a 25 to 30 minute wait which I didn't mind. Once our pager went off we almost literally broke our necks walking to our table as the floor was so slippery.   Once seated our waitress Meghan came and took our drink orders. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while so it was nice to see some new items on the menu. When we finally decided what we wanted I chose the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage and my wife chose the Chicken Chipotle Pasta.  A few minutes later Meghan came back with our bread. 10 to 15 minutes later Meghan came back and said that our food would be coming soon. By this time a few other groups had been seated and placed their orders as well. Another twenty five minutes later we still have no food. All of the other tables around us had gotten their drinks, appetizers and entrees and we still had nothing!  Finally we got our food almost 45 minutes after being seated. We did not order appetizers just entrees so we had bread and water until our food finally came. By this time I was really feeling some type of way! At least our food as good!  After I got our check and paid I was going to just let it go but I couldn't so I asked to speak to the manager. Once she came over I let her know what happened. I let her know they we had been come to the Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and never once had to wait that long for food. She apologized and offered us a piece of cheesecake.  I usually really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience and so many other better choices I don't know when or if I will ever return.",

We both ordered the crusted chicken Romano... they first brought out the wrong meal, waitress took accountability which was fine. By the time we waited for the right one we were starved and something tasted OFF. It wasn't the chicken, wasn't the sauce, the pasta tasted like it had a whole entire shaker of salt dumped on it. My tongue was literally 'burning' from the salt. I really don't know how else to describe it. Pasta would be the easiest thing out of the meal and I can ensure you it wasn't the sauce as I barely had any sauce and had asked for extra. I tasted the sauce alone and it was fine. Whatever the heck they do in the back to the pasta is just straight awful. Please correct this. We won't be back because I can't afford to my ankles to swell from the amount of salt dumped on the pasta. YUCK.",

    "text": "After the horrendous experience I had here last weekend, I'm dropping my review to 1 star. If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. My boyfriend and I are loyal, frequent customers and were treated terribly during our last visit not only by our server, but also the manager of the restaurant.  We came in for dinner on Saturday night (09/22/18), as we typically do on weekends. Our server was Brittany M. We ordered an appetizer and an entree to split. The appetizer was great, but our Fettuccine Alfredo came out with chicken on it, which we did not ask for. It clearly states on the menu that this is an add-on for an extra cost. We let our server know, as we did not want to pay for something that neither of us wanted. She rolled her eyes and said she would have them remake it.   About two minutes later, she returned with a Fettuccine Alfredo, stating that there was one already made back in the kitchen, so she just brought it to us. It was very apparent that something was wrong, as The Cheesecake Factory always has consistently high presentation standards for their entrees. The entree that she brought to us did not have sauce neatly poured over it with parsley garnishing the top of the pasta as it normally would appear. Instead, the pasta was all tossed around into a heaping mess, sauce all over the sides and rim of the bowl, and parsley all mixed in. We had really hoped that this did not mean someone dug through our entree to take out the chicken pieces. But sadly, it did. We tasted the pasta and it was not only cold and tasted like chicken, but we also found a piece of chicken stuck in between some pasta that they had missed. We were so appalled that I went up to the front counter to wait to ask to speak with a manager about the situation. Our server asked me what I was doing and before I could answer, she said sorry that she forgot the cheese and ran off. This was very strange to me, so I asked my boyfriend to come up with me as well. He then stood up at the counter with me, and she again approached us asking what's wrong. We told her that our meal needed remade due to the fact that it appeared it was not remade the first time. She said \"okay\" (not sorry, nothing at all), ran to our table and grabbed the bowl, and ran to the kitchen. It was all very strange behavior.  After a while, she returned acting just as strange and nervous with an actual new entree. It was presented to normal standards and was hot and fresh. She ran off again, and about fifteen minutes later the restaurant manager came to talk to us. The manager asked if our meal was okay now. We said yes and explained what had happened, and she was just in a rush to leave the discussion. She said \"Wow we don't usually do things like that, but I wasn't there so I don't know what happened sorry.\" We were baffled at the lack of concern that she had for the situation and the fact that her employee would behave in such an inappropriate manner. Obviously we did not eat the meal, as clearly we can't trust the server who brought it to the table. I'm honestly not sure why the manager did not offer to take it off the bill after all that we had to go through to get it.  To sum it up, the manager here is very unprofessional and does not seem concerned if employees to lie to customers or cut corners when it comes to food quality and customer service. Although we used to come here so often and it's very close by, we are so appalled and disgusted that I'm not sure if we'll be able to give this place a chance again.",

Every time I come here I try to get a new flavor, but find myself getting the Oreo Dream Extreme or Tuxedo. Aside from the cheesecake, their food is also very good. Portion sizes are large so you usually have enough for leftovers and they are usually pretty quick with bringing you your food. While you're waiting they bring warm bread to your table, just don't fill up on its goodness. Staff is attentive and friendly, and  atmosphere is casual.

She never ordered the calamari that I asked about 2 times.  And then was argumentative with us as to what words were misunderstood.  Just apologize and correct the situation!    It took an hour for my dinner to arrive bc it was over cooked the first time.   So much for a quick meal on my way home from a 12 hour work day.    Very disappointed with the way it was handled.

As a less obvious recommendation, I must say that the loaded potato bite appetizer is on point delicious. I suggest that customers avoid getting the pasta because the sauce isn't great. Prices are a bit high, but they have good affordable items like the turkey blt which are surprisingly way better than good by taste. The service is very slow because the restaurant is so popular, and the wait time can become severe at dinner time especially. I took an additional star away because the food came to the table below a nice hot temperature.",

The same things were still things for me: getting into the tables, which were packed as tight as ever, was like getting on a super-crowded flight (impossible for those sitting next to your table to get in our out without their backsides swinging over your starter or you sliding your table aside), brusque and indifferent service (except for delivery of the check, which happened well before any of us had finished eating and would have put an Olympic sprinter to shame) and the final delight, the daring charges for food that is only ever OK.  The exception, of course, is the cheesecake, which is always awesome and why we came, and the atmosphere that comes with lots and lots of people eating and waiting for long times to get in.  It's still probable that you'll get a better meal at your local diner. And you'll certainly save enough to repeat that meal several times with what you'll save. But busting atmospheres with lots of people laughing is in itself an attraction.",

I'm not one to ask for things to be taken off my bill but had I not been charged I probably would have never made a review. I thought it would be removed especially because i hardly touched my salad.

Then I went back today and the silverware was dirty there was a leak in my cup, and the waiter never stopped by to see if we needed anything if he did he would have noticed  that there was a puddle of water on my table that eventually started running down the table,he checked on other tables at least third times before asking us if we were ready to order and the silverware was dirty and it's not the first time.  This is not the cleanest Cheesecake Factory either.  Anytime I pay over $20 a meal I expect the restaurant and my silverware be clean, and my food not to be burnt along with excellent customer service.  So I probably won't be to this location again or a long time.  This was my first time visiting a Cheesecake Factory, I actually went to the Apple Store at Ross Park and we decided to stop here for lunch.  When we walked in there was no line and we were seated right away I really liked the Egyptian themed decor it was very calming and ambient.  I ordered the gumbo which was good it had chicken, shrimp, andouille sausage, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and other spices topped with rice.  Before I left I ordered my desert to go I got the red velvet cheesecake and my daughter got the Oreo chocolate cheesecake.  It was a little pricey for a bowl of gumbo $17.95, $3.00 for a coke, and $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake, but it was good and our waitress was great.",

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory is always a nice go-to place for date night. My boyfriend and I went here last Saturday to get some dinner before our movie started. Of course on a late Saturday afternoon, we expected to wait and for the place to be jam-packed, but after walking in and telling the hostess how many were in our group, we were able to get a table within two minutes outside. It was a bit warm outside, but if you sit in the shade it's not so bad. For an appetizer, we ordered their pretzel bites with cheese fondue and some fancy mustard. The waitress said this item was fairly new to the menu, and to be honest I was not impressed. The pretzels by themselves were excellent, and I'm not much of a mustard dipping kinda gal, but the mustard was pretty great too. The cheese fondue is what leads my parade of disappointment. It just wasn't creamy. It was super gritty and tasted a lot like the cheese just separated, it also could have used a bit of salt. My boyfriend for his entree ordered a cheddar stuffed burger that came with some caramelized onions and regular burger toppings on the side, along with some fries of course. He exclaimed that it was the absolute best burger he's ever had. And that's quite a compliment considering that he may as well be called the Burger King. For my entree I got some fettuccine alfredo with chicken. The last time I ordered this dish, it was nothing but fettuccine noodles in a pool of butter. This time when I ordered it, it actually came in a creamy sauce, so definitely an upgraded compared to last time. My complaint for this dish is that the sauce was super thin, it could have been served more like a soup honestly. The sauce and chicken were also lacking a lot of salt and seasoning. To me it was very plain and bland. Not too exciting. Now on to the lady of the hour, the god almighty cheesecake!  I got a Nutella crunch cheesecake (I forget the long and drawn out name that it's actually called) My was it superb! I was in heaven! Best cheesecake ever! Who could expect anything less of course? Overall the experience was pretty enjoyable. Our server was excellent, stopping by constantly to ask us how our food was and to refill our drinks. Definitely want to come back to try one of their other 250 menu items! (So many options!)",

No other complaints were heard from my associates, but when we ordered the cheesecake my goodness was it amazing. They don't call it the Cheesecake Factory for nothing, when you go here get yourself a slice it's well worth it. The size of the menu was huge too, there was like 2 pages of appetizers, and I bet they all tasted at least OK. If you can handle waiting, GO HERE!",

At noon on a Saturday, we had to wait 20 minutes which wasn't too bad but by the time we left the waiting area was jam packed. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad which is my favorite salad of their's. It was so good that I was about halfway done with it before I noticed they didn't even put the chicken on it (I even looked at the picture I took to confirm!). I had ordered a salad to-go for someone when we all placed our orders originally and our waitress forgot to put this in so we had wait another 15 minutes after paying our checks for this.",

I don't think I've ever had a meal there where the food has been bad. I would definitely recommend getting the cheesecake either as dessert or to go because why go to the Cheesecake Factory if you aren't getting cheesecake??",

I was not about to change my baby on a bathroom floor so I had to take her to the car and change her.   For dinner I had the spicy cashew chicken (my fave!!!) it came out super hot and a little burnt. I didn't notice the burnt black parts until the next day when I warmed it up. I'm positive the 1 minute I put it in the microwave did not to that.  I also had a strawberry lemonade and it was so thick, I think I got a cavity drinking it. Lol.",

And to this day, I still don't like the novel of a menu, or the size of the portions.  That said, my most recent visit - the meal was great. Maybe their food is better than I remember it, maybe I was really hungry last night, but consider me impressed for the moment. We still had a 45 minute wait, but my chicken picata hit the spot. I was able to finish it as we skipped out on appetizers.  We ordered some cheesecake to go, and it was good, nothing spectacular. Long story short, it's easy to hate on this chain, but if you pick right you'll likely have a good meal and that's what matters most.",

Every time I visit I have try the passion iced tea and one of the small plate appetizers that range from $4 - $6. they are the perfect portion and price. The restaurant could be better, though.  Having to wait for a table, and then wait another 10 -15 minutes next to the hostess podium to be sat is odd.  The portions are friggin huge, and while they dont charge a fee to share entrees, the chefs will not split the entrees for you, the way they will at Bravo.  The server will hand you another plate and a serving spoon - there ya go, have at it! Charging $7 - $9 for a piece of cheesecake is robbery given that the cheesecake is just defrosted from a cardboard box.  The atmosphere is ugly and outdated, and I always look up to wonder if one of those cone-shaped fixtures is about to fall and impale me.  The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and you can definitely find something on the menu to rave about.",

At my most recent visit, the bread, as always, is delightful.  I like the wheat bread that is soft and slightly sweet.  The sourdough is also a favorite, though I'm not a fan of any sourdough really.  My mom and I split the Cuban sandwich, which was my favorite menu item.  The ham, pulled pork, pickle and mustard just get along amazingly well.  The portions are HUGE, so definitely plan on splitting so you leave room for the best part, dessert!  Again, dessert is huge so either split, or a better idea, order it all for you and take some home for later!  I've tried many a cheesecake there, but my favorite is the original or the strawberry.  All cheesecake, less foo-foo stuff.  The decor is over the top, but intentionally so.  The servers are always welcoming and helpful when it comes to deciding the cheesecake.",

The wait was about an hour, which I was ok with especially after hearing so many rave reviews of the food and cheesecake. While waiting I couldn't help but be distracted by one of the front desk girls who was constantly on her cell phone while patrons were trying to get her attention. Once we were seated, our waiter was nice enough. I ended up ordering their fish and chips and my husband ordered their club sandwich. When the food came I have 5 smallish pieces of fish and fries (I got a salad instead of the coke slaw). At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small for being over $17 for the meal but I figured it must be good. My fish was over cooked and unseasoned. It was chewy!  My husbands club sandwich was ok although the bread was over toasted as well. When I asked for extra ketchup our waiter gave me a nasty look and walked away. I assumed he hadn't heard me and must have gave a weird look for another reason. He did come back with the ketchup. We got cheesecake to go and I haven't had it yet but I sure hope it is awesome!  I will not go back!",

I do find them a bit overpriced, and that's the only thing that keeps me from eating there weekly. Some of my personal favorites...Cuban sandwich, crispy chicken costoletta, corn cake appetizer, firecracker salmon, orange chicken, and dinner salads are great.

If you want to eat here you have to wait the old fashioned way.

On Monday afternoon my lunch guest and I ordered Renee's special. Nothing too complicated, right? We waited thirty five minutes for our meal and this entire time we never saw our waiter. He never filled our ice teas   or water or checked on us to pretend he even cared. To really top this lunch trip off when we finally got our meal, our French onion soup was ice cold. Again, we didn't see our waiter until we were almost done with our meal, sans the soup. We told him our disappointment with the soup and wait time and he sent over a manager. The manager told us that HE forgot to turn the soup warmer on and offered to warm up our soup. THAT'S IT! After waiting for thirty five minutes you want me to wait while you warm up my soap? I have never experienced such horrible customer in my life. I hope this will serve you on how to better train your management staff since they obviously need a lot of work.",

What I'm trying to get past though is the 500 page menu with nothing that is particularly healthy. Also, as a general rule I try to stay away from chains (it helps me feel more snobby). But like I said at the Cheesecake Factory, everything seems to taste great.  On our last trip I went with the \"Bang Bang Chicken.\" Sure, it wasn't what I'd expect from an authentic Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't have been at the CF if I wanted authentic Thai. For an American take on the dish I'll say it tasted awesome.  If nutrition is on your mind, it's a bit tough to navigate the menu. You'll probably be able to get out under 1,000 calories, but you need to know what to look for, limit the alcohol intake and skip dessert.  At the end of the day, if you're looking to meet up with friends it's a great venue. Tastes will appeal to almost anyone, the drinks are good, and if you're splurging, the Cheesecake is fantastic.",

We have been to this location at least 30 times over the years and have had good meals.  Today not the case.  Start with the edible meal.  My wife ordered chicken tortilla soup and turkey sandwich with small salad.   The bowl of CHICKEN tortilla soup had 2, maybe 3 pieces of actual chicken in it.  Hardly any tortilla in the soup, but it had flavor and was spicy.  We were given white sourdough bread, but expected the good dark sweet bread that we have received every other time here.  For some reason we didn't get the bread we liked but the tables next to us got it?   Her sandwich was okay, nothing to brag about.  I ordered a dinner portion Cobb salad.  I have ordered this before and really enjoyed it.  This time it came out looking sad.  I noticed a literal ball shape of chicken on the right side of the salad.  Upon inspecting it and peeling apart the chicken layers, it was nasty.  It showed many signs of being undercooked, was a bit slippery, and was fatty.  It was also stone cold.  It looked like someone reached into an old tray of chicken and grabbed a ball of old chicken and set it on my salad.  The kitchen staff obviously did not inspect the chicken.  The rest of the salad was not too good.  Hardly any egg around the edge like I normally get.  Barely any dressing in the salad and not much bacon.  It was basically chopped lettuce.   I showed the waitress the chicken and her face showed it all.  She showed the manager and he came over and apologized and agreed that the chicken looked bad.  He did not charge me for the salad.  I was offered replacement food as well but did not feel like eating anything else there at the time.   The salad was $15.  I hope they have not changed their salads since the last time I had a good one there.   It definitely was not worth $15 even with a good piece of chicken.    Overall, a nice day off with my wife and the lunch was a huge disappointment.  I probably won't go back to this restaurant for a while.  The staff were nice and I left a 15% tip based on the full meal price before the comped salad.  Not the waitress fault that the kitchen was inept today in performing their job.",

Whomever did the design of this restaurant in particular did not take into account the number of people who frequent this area. Cheesecake Factory is a popular chain that a plethora of people enjoy. I will probably not come to this location due to thr lack of waiting and standing over people while they are eating.",

When I stopped here at around 2pm the wait was about an hour they said so I found an open seat at the bar and ordered there.   The draft beer was pretty good, the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes was fantastic. I got the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and wasn't impressed. You figure The Cheesecake Factory would have great cheesecake but it tasted like it was made of a thick pudding. Maybe I'm used to New York type cheesecake, pretty firm with some nice taste, this wasn't it.   The place was packed and noisy, when i left around 4pm they were saying the wait was about 1.5 hours. Maybe if I just got the main course I wouldn't mind waiting but overall it was an average (and expensive) lunch.",

    "text": "I have been here several times and it is always because it is just a convenient option. As far as chain restaurants go, it is fine. The decor is always awful and quite frankly I have no idea what it has to do with cheesecake. I also wonder why they make their servers dress in white. It seems like a bad idea because they will always look dirty. You just can't keep white clean in a restaurant. I think they want you to feel like you're in heaven but if so, it must be the dodgy part.   The food is decent but I find their portions to be way too large creating inflated prides. Also, their menu is so large it seems impossible for them to make anything amazing food-wise. I do like their cheesecake but I question the amount of unnecessary ingredients they use.   We ordered the white bean chicken chili from the Skinny menu (because we wanted normal portions). And we also shared the kabob appetizer. Both were among the most enjoyable things I've gotten there. The chili was very good and a bit spicy. The kabob could have been better but I wasn't expecting authentic kabob taste. The meat was the disappointing part. The yogurt sauce was good though.     Our waitress last nice gave us an extra 25 minutes to decide on dessert since we weren't ready the first time. I'm not sure where she went but we didn't even see her to flag down in that time period.   Overall this place is fine in a pinch but it will never be among my favorites.",

The waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and made sure the chef knew my allergies prior to preparing my meal. This is seldom the case in large chain restaurants with huge menus! I was very pleasantly surprised. As for the food, my husband got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. This was an oversized plate that they are known for, but he said it was excellent. I opted for the Turkey Avocado sandwich and a side salad. It sounds so simple but it was delicious! I was also very pleased with their fun presentation since I didn't get a bun. They made it a nice sandwich stack! I will definitely be heading back for a bite when I'm at the mall again!",

My favorite part of this dish is the corn cakes.  They are so good.  The dish is a little bit spicy (but I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to heat).  I also had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake.  I am a huge salted caramel fan, but this cheesecake was so disappointing!  There's so much caramel it's overwhelming.  There are no other flavor dimensions.  It's probably the worst cheesecake I've had from there.  All the complaints aside, I love this place.  It's a special treat.",

You can spend those minutes taking a stroll through the shops of Ross Park.  Oh and did I mention the ketchup? But besides that, the service here is very nice, and no one at my table had food left on their plates. The cheesecake here is no joke! Maybe that's why it's called the Cheesecake Factory? I got the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake and wow, I was planning on taking a photo of it to show the world it's beauty but I couldn't wait to devour the chocolate treat.  The best cheesecake ever, if you're a fan of mega chocolate delights then this will make you jump for joy.  Besides the food, the whole building is beautiful and well designed.

Best way to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory is go an hour or so before you really want to eat and get on the waiting list.  Take a buzzer with you into the mall, shop for a while and then check back.

    "text": "I know exactly what to expect from Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The food is always consistent, they have plenty of choices (maybe even too many), and the cheesecake is rich and delicious. I've been here a few times during off-peak hours and there is sometimes still a wait. The wait on weekends just isn't worth it.   The food is rich. Everything is rich. Sauces, toppings, cheese... and if those weren't heavy enough, they bring warm endless baskets of bread with butter. Hmmm, can anyone really leave without dessert? OK, it's delicious. Yes, it's delicious. But, this isn't the place you want to eat three times a week, or you'll soon be buying a new wardrobe. (Check out their calorie counts for each menu item--some entrees have a whole day's worth of calories--and that's before you add on appetizers, bread, and, of course, the cheesecake!)  Enough of that...  The menu is about a half inch thick with lots of variety. It's a 'something-for-everyone' place that offers seafood, meat, poultry, and pasta. Most of the entrees are pasta-based meals in very generous portions. We usually leave with plenty of leftovers to make another meal.   Every Cheesecake Factoy I've ever visited has the exact same menu, the exact same portions, and the exact same decor. Once inside, you can't tell if you're in a Cheesecake Factory in Florida, or a Cheesecake Factory in Pennsylvania, or a Cheesecake Factory in Moscow (if there are any in Moscow!) There is a reason they call this place a 'Factory.' It's like going into an expensive McDonald's--you know exactly what to expect, both good and bad.  The decor is 'Bellagio' meets 'Disney World.'  The interior of this place (like all other Cheesecake Factories) is someone's idea of ancient Rome (I think). It looks like the interior of most houses on that old TV show \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' proving that there is no correlation between wealth and good taste.   As everyone else comments, the wait is long--sometimes painfully long--and the seating is often cramped. They don't accept reservations, and the range of the pagers is not too far from the front entrance. The hostess will give you a fairly accurate estimation of how long your wait will be, so you're probably safe taking a walk around the mall and returning reasonably often to ask, 'How much longer....?' That's IF you really want to eat here. When I do go here, I usually plan on a late lunch/early dinner (3PM) or visit on weekday evenings.  I have to admit, I started this review with 5 stars, and as I wrote all the negatives, I kept whittling away at stars, until I ended up giving them 2. If you're in the mood for heavy, rich, 'comfort' food, by all means splurge (both calories and $$$) and eat here. I usually go here when friends suggest it. There are other many other good restaurants within a mile or two.",

Was told very testily it was because they \"weren't on a long wait!!!\". Didn't appreciate the attitude. Was also told they do not send texts. So basically, \"Too bad, stand in line.\". What kind of customer service is that??",
