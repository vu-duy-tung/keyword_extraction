I tried the red Sangria which came in a huge glass and was delicious! The white also looked very tasty. They had many draft beer selections including Rivertown and Summer Shandy. They are known for their build your own burgers and you can pick your meat and toppings with many different choices all coming with a side of fries. My date was happy with his burger and all the options. I went with a appetizer of the pretzel twist which came with a cheese and mustard sauce. Very tasty and worth the $5. For a busy Friday at happy hour our waitress did a nice job.",

It was my first time here and was surprised to see they have a build your own breakfast sandwich slip of paper (for hamburgers too). I had the sausage and egg, cheddar, tomato and the house sauce. Added a hash brown on the side for $1. Whole meal was under $10 and so yummy. Love that they have outdoor seating as well and different drink specials!",

Our server Jen was very nice and very attentive! My boyfriend had some wings, the sauces were really good and flavorful. I had a jerky cow, one of their specialty burgers. I ordered it MR and to my surprise it actually came out MR! I know it sounds like it should be a given, but I can't remember when was the last time I had a burger in a sports bar that was cooked to the right temp! Great job! That being said, the burger was missing that spicy kick from jerk seasoning I expected... Good flavor all in all! Our friends enjoyed their food as well! We definitely will be back!",

I wasn't finished with my drink yet, but the server came by and asked if we wanted the check.

    "text": "I know this is a new establishment and they're still working kinks out... but I had a very bad experience at Tipsy Cow. I went on a Monday night for dinner.  It's seat yourself, but there was no way to know it until one of the servers walking by told us to seat ourselves. The other group waiting who came after us then took the table we would've wanted so we lucked out there.  It took a while for our server to find us and bring us menus, one of which was a beer menu written on a piece of receipt paper... While we were waiting to place our order, we saw a group of people leave without ordering and left their menus on their table - bad sign. There were only 2 servers working there that night, so I understand why we didn't see our server much. But the lack of service we received when she came by and her unfriendliness was very discouraging. We ordered burgers, which arrived way over cooked. We asked for refills of water but never got them. Our server would visit the table next to us but would ignore us, and not once did she even ask how things were. We eventually had to go up to the bar to get waters. Oh but when we went up to the bar, the bartender had disappeared for a few minutes too. At last, we saw our waitress who already had our check and silently left it on the table. We noticed that she at least had the time to write \"thank you\" on the check. She again visited the table next to us but conveniently didn't notice our check was ready to be picked up so I had to get up and follow her to hand it to her.  I was definitely not impressed by the venue or the food. The service could have made up for it, but unfortunately it was severely lacking.",

I have talked to a couple of people who had bad experiences, so safe to say I was skeptical, but we rather enjoyed ourselves!  They have a small menu with a few \"house\" made burgers/sandwiches, salads, apps, or a build your own burger menu, very much like another popular burger joint some might be familiar with (*hint hint* rhymes with Purgatory), and milkshakes. Both the BF and I 'built our own' burgers- him the 50/50 with a salad and I ordered the beef with fries. I liked mine; it was cooked properly and tasty. We both enjoyed the 50/50 burger; I was surprised how much you could taste the bacon-y flavor, although I felt it was a little dry and he said it was not, it was juicy, so you will have to form your own opinion there... We also tried a salty caramel milkshake for the walk home and it was good.  I know the other reviews complain about the service, and like I said, I have heard that from people I know, but our service was fine. Our waitress was attentive enough; filled waters, asked how things were, checked in...things of that nature.   For me, I enjoyed this place. I would have probably only given it 3.5 stars if I was able, but Yelp has yet to make that change (*hint hint* Yelp). It wasn't my favorite but I would definitely go again.",

The service was good and our waitress was attentive, but it was about Noon on a Saturday and a few tables, so they really weren't that busy.

After waiting for about 5 minutes and almost having another group butt in front of us, the hostess came over. We ask for a table for two outside since we had the dog and she just stared at us. There was clearly a table available, but eventually she found her words and told us it would be a 40 minute wait and just walk away to the group waiting for a table behind us. No can I take your name, would you like to wait, nothing. It was the rudest thing ever for her to just pass over us.

Our server also failed to remember individual orders for billing. When we stated which items were being paid by whom, the check inevitable came back with the items on the incorrect receipts. When we requested modification, she said it was not possible to modify the items to someone else who wished to pay for the appetizers because they were not the original requestees. There were people at our table who waited so long to place their initial drink orders (despite the restaurant not being full at all) that they grew tired of waiting and went to the inside bar to order and pay for their drinks. I should also note that the drink prices varied between our server and the inside bar (a margarita from the bar was $3.50 but was $7 from the table server). Lastly, it seems that the restaurant does not respond to customer feedback as I wrote and submitted this message to Tipsy Cow's Contact Us page, and no response as been received to date. It's a shame that their service was so poor; my colleagues and I have no plans to return to this establishment.",

One of the biggest disappointments was the fact that the kitchen crew would come directly outside next to the patio where guests are seated, and smoke, multiple times throughout our meal. I didn't come to a restaurant to sit in an ashtray. This was unsanitary and also probably was the reason our three burgers took 45 minutes on a not busy night.   Additionally our burgers were cooked well done when we all circled medium rare. The overcooked burger was accompanied by extremely undercooked cold fries.   Last thing - I understand there are new servers all the time, however ours mentioned she was new multiple times and that she didn't know the items we were asking for on the menu. She didn't use anything to write down our orders so after every time we ordered a new drink or food item, she would come back out to ask again what we wanted.

Overall, Tipsy Cow is a good addition to Shadyside with ample outdoor seating (surprisingly hard to find in the Burgh) to celebrate the end of winter and a VERY reasonably priced drink and food menu. Great casual spot to hang out with a few friends.   Ambience: I didn't go inside so I can't comment much on the interior. They did a great job capitalizing on the front space though- at least 10 tables to seat 4-6 people. Plus the front wall retracts to open the whole restaurant to the outdoor air. Definitely need more of this in Pittsburgh when the weather is nice.   Food: Fried mac n cheese = epitome of Pittsburgh. Sooo good and heart attack inducing. The fried pickles and French fries I thought were pretty standard. They also have a build-a-burger concept for $10-15 or so. The wings were average. Good bar food but nothing to write home about except the fried mac n cheese. I'll go back just for that.   Drinks: The beer list was disappointing- a reasonable mix of types but they didn't have many craft or local beers. Aside from that, cocktails were rather reasonably priced. And on Thursdays, 1/2 off sangria pitchers with some of the best sangria I've had in the city for $7 per pitcher.  Service: This was where I disagreed with other reviews. Maybe we went on a good day or after they fixed their problems from opening. The service was prompt and helpful. Plus they brought out a beer pitcher for my friend's dog to drink out of and a box for him to eat his food. I haven't seen many dog friendly establishments in Pittsburgh...",

I then tried the blackberry mule special they had that night, and that was unique and delicious as well. I ordered carnitas tacos off the appetizer menu and when they arrived, to my dismay, they were mahi mahi tacos! i would have probably loved them had i not been allergic to fish, so i had to politely send them back. i could not be happier with the response of the staff. the manager was extremely apologetic and said that my next drink of my choice was on the house. while i don't easily get disappointed by wrong orders, i was extremely impressed by the reaction of the staff. i highly recommend. while i doubt the tipsy cow staff makes mistakes often, they surely redeem themselves on the rare occasion that they do. and the carnitas tacos were bomb!",

Our waitress was prompt, but it seemed as though the kitchen and the bar were definitely running slow.   We ordered two appetizers that oddly came with the exact same dipping sauce. The fried pickles were definitely better than the fried mac and cheese bites.   The burgers came next after quite a wait and my friends Sangria took a while as well. Once the burgers came mine was missing most of the toppings and needed to be sent back. My friends milkshake was also MIA.   When my burger was back in the kitchen the waitress explained that they just forgot a few of the toppings and were adding them to the burger. As such when my burger was returned to me it was severely dried out, though I will say it was worth returning just to get the cheese wheel topping that was delicious.   When my friends milkshake did appear it was also dropped off without a straw. Overall the service was spotty and the food was just ok. I might go back, but with so many different burger places in Pittsburgh I am not sure I will.",

    "text": "I went on a Friday evening around dinner time and expected great things - I'm a big fan of Stack'd in Shadyside also and their burgers are yum!  First of all our service was terrible. I hate to say that because the waitress was very nice and friendly but I think the place was just highly understaffed with way too many customers and not enough waiters/waitresses to handle them. It was over a half hour between the time I sat down and the time I actually was able to even order anything (maybe a 15 minute wait just for my glass of water).  I ordered wings to share, half Thai Chili and half OMFG! sauce (both of which I've had at Stack'd) and though I am aware that they are labeled spicy - usually my friend and I can handle spicy. However these were WAYY too spicy to the point where you could tell the flavor was good but the fire was just a bit much.  They also lost my other friend's burger order and had to rush it later after the rest of our food had already been brought out even though he turned in his order slip along with us.  Then when we were almost finished eating and ready to go, the waitress came out with 2 more wings saying the kitchen had dropped them (on the floor?) and decided to make us new ones give them to us like 20+ minutes later? We hadn't noticed because the menu doesn't say how many you are actually supposed to get but I thought this was strange - though it was nice of them to give us the wings even though we didn't ask for them.   I don't want to be too harsh and ideally I would leave around 2.5 stars but since the wings were good (albeit too hot to handle) I'll round up to 3. But the establishment needs to pick up the pace a bit because the service was far too slow and I spent a good chunk of my time here feeling frustrated.",

It was rather loud due to the live band (i.e. three dudes playing instruments and singing popular songs, it was pretty good), and so not really an ideal place to have an intimate conversation.  We often found each other pseudo yelling to hear each other.    I tried to order Sangria... despite there being a usual special on thursday nights (the night we went) ...well apparently they arent doing sangria because they are doing like a wine series.  Oh well, I got a strawberry basil margarita which was strong and had a rather artificial strawberry taste.  That being said, I really enjoyed the customizable burgers.  I ordered a bunless burger with classic rub and various toppings like tomato, romaine, onion, cucumber, and avocado.  The waitress said the classic rub would be ok but didnt really know much else haha.  Anyway, the point is I had no reaction and it was definitely gluten free :D   So it was a nice night out with live music, pretty good food, and an ok drink.   I'd go back again.",

There are some interesting apps fried mac and cheese bites and, my forever app, the fried pickle.  They are slices, not spears, but the spicy ranch is mouth burning.  Keep in mind that Tipsy Cow means spicy when they say spicy.  I like a little spicy, but nothing that takes away from my meal and I need to counter act it with something else.

There were about 13 of us so we knew the food might take a little longer than normal, but we started getting there at 5 and called 2 days before and the day of, so they knew we were coming. Also, there were only a few other groups of people eating there when we ordered. At 6:15 we started to get a little annoyed but it was still fine. 6:45...nothing. During this whole time waiting, not a single waitress came over to check to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. It was at 7, I believe, that 3 burgers came out. The 1st one there were no complaints about so I can only assume it was fine or our friend was just that hungry and wanted to eat. The 2nd was burned and cold. I was \"lucky\" enough to get the 3rd. They brought out my burger over an hour after we ordered...too bad I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. About 10 minutes later they brought my chicken sandwich out, before bringing out anyone else's food, this time it was a grilled chicken sandwich instead of the crispy that I ordered. We then paid for our drinks and left. Some of our friends stayed but when we left no other food had been brought out. We will not be returning there. We then walked over to Urban Tap, which is just a 4 minute walk down the street, where I got an incredible chicken sandwich and was loaded up with fries. Our waitress was incredible and made sure all of the food came out as fast as possible. Definitely check that place out and don't got to Tipsy Cow.",

It was already disappointing that the rarest you can go is medium rare because I always eat my burgers rare. However, when I bit into my burger, I was even more disappointed to find that my \"medium rare\" burger was actually medium. The white sangria I ordered was really average. I wouldn't order it again. I must say though that the burgers are very fairly priced. $9 each including fries with several $1 add-in options (ex: egg, avocado, guacamole, bacon, onion straws, fried mac & cheese).

Like, actually that is what it was. The lettuce was pulled straight from a salad. It was basically leftovers on top of nacho chips. I ate a little because I was starving, but it was an approximately $14.00 nacho plate full of other people's uneaten meals. Or whatever was in the kitchen, i don't know. Whatever happened, it was really, really bad. I will say that my friend got wings, and they were okay. Food roulette, I guess.",

    "text": "Ambiance: This place used to be Shadyside Saloon and was completely revamped.  There was a brief stint as \"Stack'd 2\" and \"The Avenue\", but it seems the name has now settled on \"Tipsy Cow\".  The setting is an upscale burger joint similar to BRGR or Burgatory.  Several TVs inside along the bard with plenty of seating for groups as well.  There's darts in the back.  Really nice outdoor seating area for about 25 people which is dog friendly and awesome in nice weather.  Food: They offer several predefined burger options as well as a \"build-your-own\" option similar to Stack'd.  They also offer several apps, mostly of the fried variety.  I've had a few different burger options and all have been good but none amazing.  Drinks:  I have fairly high standards as far as draft beer lists go and the options here are fairly middle of the road with mostly standard widely distributed craft and national brews.  There's a few different wines by the class and a full bar.  They have sangria by the pitcher or glass and it's half-off sangria pitchers on Thursday's bringing the price down to $7.50, making this a great option for a warm Thursday evening outside.  Furthermore drinks are half-priced during happy-hour from 5-7.  Overall: While the burgers aren't the best in town the place is still pretty cool overall.  I like that it's dog friendly, has great outdoor seating, and nice drink specials.",

From burgers, to fried pickles, wings, and even the salads the food tastes extraordinary.   Their cocktails are delicious too, but a bit pricy, so I usually only enjoy one and then get a classic mixed drink. The crowd that goes is usually 20s-30s I would say, at least for lunches and weekend drinking, so their music played reflects on that and is usually whatever the top songs on the radio are. Touchtunes is also there though so if there's something special you DO want to hear, you're more than welcome to switch it up!   Depending when you go the restaurant could be packed and very loud, or it can be pretty empty with only a few tables taken. I don't have a preference as the service doesn't seem to be affected either way. Keep it up tipsy cow, you have a loyal customer :)",

    "text": "This place has a serious identity crisis. Tipsy Cow is the newest rebrand for this location, which was redone last year around this time. First informally known as 'Stack'd 2' after Stackd in Shadyside it was finally given the official name of 'The Ave' in the Fall. I found they had rebranded to the Tipsy Cow when I arrived back from Hong Kong at the beginning of April.  Last time I was there was Monday as the day was pleasant and my friend and I had a desire to dine outside. The tipsy cow has 4-5 tables outside and another 3 booths with opened up windows. Very good. K and I arrived to find a few of our MBA kids already sitting so we joined the party and eventually inherited the table. The corner booths comfortably fit 5 people.   Once seated, our waitress [waitron] was MIA. So it took about 10 minutes or a little more for me to finally get a good old Dogfish Head 60 minute. [How I do love this Beer] At least with company the waiting was not bad. Finally I grabbed some wings [super crispy and filling but at $10 for 12 that's a bit pricey for Pittsburgh] and K some fries [standard]. After taking over the table we lounged until it started raining and hunted down the MIA waitron so we could leave.  Pros: Good draft beer selection, wings, Build you own Burger menu, outdoor seating Cons: MIA waitron  Good staple for Ellsworth but nothing spectacular.",

With that being said, Tipsy Cow is the spot for me. Sunday mornings are rarely too busy to enjoy and you can usually scheme that VIP treatment with a few clever words to the waiting staff.   The breakfast food is head and shoulders above the rest of the menu in every way imaginable. If you stray too far from the sausage egg and cheese don't say i didn't warn you. The sausage BANGS and is has the heartiness I've longed for since moving to Pittsburgh. It wasn't very busy during my visit and it's unfortunate that our waitress wasn't more attentive towards us given our party size. I understand there are several moving parts for a server to handle and there is often many behind the scenes issues he or she must face, but we needed a little more dedication from our sister.   The nachos might be the worst in the city. Fake cheese, pre cooked chicken (i understand this is the standard), sub par sour cream, it was didn't deserve a spot on the menu and almost made this a 4 Star review.  On a positive note, this place has the best Bloody Mary's in the city. Whatever BM mix they use is something serious and for 3 buck you ain't gonna find much better.   French fries are fire. Sausage smacks. Clean dining room. Just make sure you get one of the short italian beauty's to take care of you.  XFactor: PRICE. 10 bucks for a sausage egg & cheese, fresh cooked fries, and a Bloody Mary.",

In the warmer months, they offer an awesome patio that puts you right in the heart of all the bustle on Ellsworth.   I have been here more times than I can count and I am never overwhelmed by anything on the menu. It's average American fare, but it makes a good snack when you're drinking.

There weren't any tables available for our group for trivia night (which is no one's fault) so the five of us had to situate ourselves at the bar. There were no drink specials or food specials either, which is also kind of disappointing because the food is pretty overpriced in my opinion. I ordered a BYO-burger and the patty was tiny. Alcohol is always expensive anywhere so that's why it's nice to just grab the special since it's cheap, but there weren't any, so we just split a pitcher.   The service was okay and not very attentive (also slightly rude when my friend asked questions about what was on tap) but the atmosphere of the other diners was nice and bustling. Trivia was really fun and the trivia host was super super great. But that was it. If it were not for the trivia that night and my friends wanting to go, I definitely would not come here for the food.",

My friend and I both built our own burgers, and despite the fairly well-done (I appreciate the crispy, charred outside that added additional texture and flavor) patty, I was pleasantly surprised that I was satiated enough to go into hibernation for the remaining night.  Things I liked: -friendly, welcoming staff -delicious french fries. They had skins left on, which contributes a crispier outside and soaks up the oily, salty goodness to add additional flavor -great options to build a burger  Things I didnt like: -the environment is really loud, at least on the late-night Friday we went. We exchanged our culinary experience that through sophisticated banter that comprised of yelling or ignoring each other. Perhaps it was the college basketball craze of the season... -I appreciate the option to select whether I want my patty 'pink' or 'no pink' although I doubt either really makes much of a difference. An alternative would be to go well-done and charred, respectively.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and for the price was happy for the late-night dining experience!",

    "text": "Food and drinks were okay - their menu is BYOB - build your own burger. The burgers are actually quite big, the meat patty was tasty and overall worth the money. I was a bit disappointed by the Buffalo Chicken Wings as it was drowned in a sauce that could be barely described as Buffalo.   Typical (dive-ish) sports bar - good for groups for Happy Hour. If you eat here, go with the burger.  PS: Our table won the trivia game that night and was rewarded with a $25 gift card. They didn't want to let us use it though on the same night. Awkward.",

    "text": "I felt like the Tipsy Cow had a ton of potential: a build-your-own burger menu, decent location, and great atmosphere.   Unfortunately, the food just didn't live up to my expectations. The burgers we're ok, but nothing to write home about. I really enjoyed their unique fries which had a house seasoning, but I don't think they'll be for everyone. I had a chocolate milkshake too which was sadly very poorly-mixed with very hefty chunks of chocolate throughout.  Nothing bad to say about the service. Our server was very friendly and happy to field a request for recommendations. The food arrived promptly despite it being a busy Friday night.  If you're nearby and want a burger, the tipsy cow might be worth stopping by to give a try. I wasn't crazy about the food though and probably won't be making a special trip again.",

We were sitting right next to the door too and were concerned cold air would blow through but I was warm so that was a plus!  Bar Trivia was fun, food was pretty similar to Stack'd.  Atmosphere was fun and I would definitely go back for a hang out.",

    "text": "I'm back in Pittsburgh and am HUNGRY. My friend Laura and I are in the mood for a juicy burger. The name Tipsy Cow caught my attention on here and couldn't stop thinking about it. Maybe because I've called myself that a few times drunkenly. Anyway, this place is amazing. First of all, a pitcher for 7 bucks is genius. Second, the system of just check marking what you want instead of having to talk-- amazing. I get the juicy burger with a pretzel bun and my god. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Great atmosphere and even better food. I really recommend this place and can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Went to check this place out last night (Friday). I was not impressed.  Pros:  Cool atmosphere but a little loud Fun menu with the build your own burger concept Hostess will seat you at a table even if your whole party isn't there Quality of food is on the same level as the price  They have a good variety of Beers on tap and in bottles and a good selection of house cocktails.   Cons: So I did a build your own burger. Ordered numerous sauces and wrote by each one \"on the side\"..... guess what the burger came out with all the sauces on it. The waitress said the kitchen must have forgot and left the burger and went to go get the sauces on the side. About 8 minutes later she brought back the sauces... really?! The burger and bun was soaked in all sorts of sauces. Gross!! I even told her but she didn't seem to care.  Moral of the story. I might come back for drinks and apps but the build your own burger concept is not what that kitchen or server is cut out to do!!",

Seven of us went for lunch today and waited over an hour until any of our meals arrived. And most of them were cold.. We are talking burgers, not some delicacy.. The waitress was incredibly apologetic and friendly but at no time did a manager or anyone else come over to apologize. Did I mention the place was empty? The meal was comped but did not disguise the  horrible management there.",

The bartender seemed quite distracted with the people she knew and her own food to remember to place my and my father's food order. We ordered two burgers and fries and it took 45 min and was not cooked to how we ordered it.  The bar fridge was not well stocked and throughout my time in the establishment the bartender had to \"check downstairs\" multiple times for different parties.  Probably will not return.",
