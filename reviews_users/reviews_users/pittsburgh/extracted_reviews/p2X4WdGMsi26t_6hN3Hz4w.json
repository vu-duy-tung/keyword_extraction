    "text": "Wonderful little place to eat in the heart of Dormont!!!! The service is superb, as this is a family run business and they all work together to make your dinner special. Not one bad thing to say about this gem. My husband and I used to live in Dormont and would eat here very often. We still stop in from time to time and couldn't be happier. I would suggest trying the steamed dumplings or the spring rolls as an appetizer. Their hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had, it has a delicious smoky, peppery taste to it. For an entree I usually get the green jade chicken and add mushrooms. That's what's so nice about this place, they let you customize your order to an extent. Definitely giving the customer what they want. Try the Emperor's Chicken for a sweet tang, or the Pho. Their pho will NOT disappoint you. I've sampled or tried probably everything on this menu and I've never been disappointed. Can't wait to go back.",

I wasn't expecting anything out of this world, but I expected at least mediocre. I ordered over the phone and was never told my total. I tried to ask, but was hung up on after giving my card information. The food took about 45 minutes. I spent 15 minutes on the phone with the driver giving him the same directions over and over. He finally arrived and was angry with me over my direction giving. (I had told him which main drag to follow and all the street names as well as landmarks.) I signed the slip for my beef lo mein and 1 shrimp roll. Although the cost was more than I expected, I was starving so I signed, tipped, and sent the man on his way. Firstly, they gave me 2 veggie egg rolls. I had ordered only 1 shrimp roll. They were doughy and only contained lettuce. I then tried my beef lo mein. I did not eat the beef as it wasn't cooked and the noodles and sparse veggies were flavorless. I spent over $15 to throw my dinner in the garbage can. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!",

The tea was tasty. We are really use to amazing Vietnamese food from Seattle and this felt very authentic. We will return for sure.

They strive for authentic and delicious food here.  Their spring rolls are also very good - they are fried, not the cellophane kind. Everything that we have tried on their menu has been great - especially anything pork. The family is so kind - they remember us and what we had the time before and suggest what we may want.  They also deliver within a 2-3 mile radius. Wonderful place.",

    "text": "We stopped into Mekong Asian Restaurant on Potomac Avenue after a movie premier for some late night chow.  Asian food is delicious and always appropriate when you have the late-night munchies.  Mekong is small, and probably seats 30-40 people. The decor was minimal, with traditional Asian decorations scattered about.   The restaurant was clean, and our server was extremely friendly.  Our waitress informed us that she the owner's daughter, and that her mother was doing all of the cooking.    We started with a spot of hot tea and steamed dumplings (10 for $5.95).  Delicate hints of ginger, garlic and pork permeated the pillowy-soft, steamed dough.  The dumplings were fun to eat with our chopsticks, and were served with a warm, soy-based dipping sauce.  We ordered two chicken dishes- General Tso's ($8.95), and Cashew Chicken ($8.95).  Both dishes were served with a side of white rice.  Our entrees arrived piping hot.  We immediately noticed that there was hardly any meat in the Cashew Chicken.  When I tell you that there were maybe 2-3 ounces of chicken in the dish, I'm not exaggerating.  The same was True of the General Tso's- only small, thin strips of chicken occupied the plate.  The sauce that came with the General Tso's also wasn't the usual rich, dark red color.    Lastly, one of your fortune cookies didn't have a fortune in it!  That's bad luck, right? Our entire meal was $25.00, but we left feeling slighted.  If you're on a budget, Mekong Restaurant might be a good choice, just don't expect a lot of chicken in your chicken dish.",

    "text": "Note to Pho lovers: They do have it! But I didn't try it. Someday I'll get around to trying Pho.   What I did have were the fried dumplings and General Tso's Shrimp.   The fried dumplings were quite a strong way to open our early dinner. The potsticker wrapping was wispycrispy and not without a little oil undrained from them, which I kinda like. I was told they were filled with chicken which isn't a variation I've ever tried before on this preferred Asian app of mine.  The General Tso's Shrimp was candy-coated, Tempura-battered rawk fury! A gluey, gooey, delight, it went well with that mound of viscous, fluffy white rice.   I tasted my friend's Sweet and Sour Chicken, and man it tasted like a pancake with some chicken inside! I liked it but would have preferred more chicken. With batter that good though, you could almost forgive that slight misstep.   The service was excellent also, and the restaurant itself is nice, clean, cool, and relaxingly informal, the menu moderately priced (2 people=$25. 95 not including tip) . The owner appears to be a fellow Gen-Xer and even had her two little ones bringing us drinks.  \"Mommy, the bald man wants another water,\" the little boy told his mom.    Adorable. I guess ya gotta start 'em young in this business, right?   Now the question is: Who has cuter kids? Tong Garden in Brookline or Mekong Restaurant? I'll leave that up to you to decide.   I'm glad we came here to eat prior to the Scorpions concert. We would have gotten pizza somewhere, but everything else seemed closed today. Thank heavens for people who party too much on July 4th, or else I might not have gotten to try Mekong.   Yeah, why do YOU think half of Pittsburgh was out of business today? Hmmmm?",

    "text": "Being hungry for Asian food in the south hills can leave one feeling a bit empty with the choices available, especially if you aren't in the mood for a belly full of cornstarch. Seeing that Mekong had Pho and good ratings, we were off to give it a shot. We entered a mostly empty restaurant with only a handful of tables and what seemed to be one woman running the front and back(I later found out there is another woman in the kitchen).  We were told to sit anywhere we'd like and immediately given water. We looked at the menu, standard american-chinese fare with some vietnamese specialties thrown in, including the Pho I had come for. My brother is a fan of General Tso's but wasn't exactly in the mood for it, so our waitress recommended he try the specialty 'Emperor' Chicken - apparently a bit more sweet and sour than your basic General Tso's.   Along with ordering, I indicated that my brother was severely allergic to nuts of all sorts, expecting to be given the standard response of 'oh, I'll check' or a vague 'they're cooked in the same area.. how allergic is he?'. No, the server, who referred to herself as Ma, explained that only two types of dished contained nuts, and that they were kept in a plastic container away from the other ingredients - completely reassuring us that no mix-ups could happen.  The food came out fairly quickly, the pho was hot but without standard items like sriracha and hoisin. No matter, the flavor was perfect, probably my favorite in the city. I was in the mood for spicy, so I did indeed ask for sriracha. She said she didn't give it because it gives the pho a lemony off-taste if you use too much of it, but that she could help me out. She went into the kitchen and brought out a small dish containing a finely sliced, bright red thai chili, warning a little goes a long way. I'm no stranger to this type of chili and throwing the whole thing in did indeed give me plenty of heat and burst of super-fresh chili flavor. I asked for a small bowl to share and she was happy to deliver that as well.  The Emperor Chicken was OK, full of large chunks of red and green peppers and onions if you like that - I prefer broccoli as my vegetable in dishes like that. It was bright and flavorful, though, and a large portion. Ma was friendly with us while we ate, asking whereabout we lived, and telling us anytime we needed to eat something good, just come see her.  All in all, this place has wonderful Pho. If you're trapped in the South Hills looking for something warm to fill you up, or just looking for a great family-run restaurant with friendly service and great chinese-american food, stop in and give Mekong a try.",

I don't know...but it most certainly is not 4 or 5 stars anymore.    Four of us went here for lunch - thought we'd give it a shot.  We each got a lunch special which came with either soup or a egg roll.  I opted for the egg roll and it was over fried and very doughy.  Borderline soggy on the inside.  It wasn't particularly tasty either.  I ate it though, because I was very hungry.  I ordered sweet and sour tofu for lunch.  When it came, the appearance was puzzling.  The sauce was brown, and the tofu looked like sandpaper.  The only vegetables that were in the dish were broccoli and bok choy (i think that's what it was.)  The sweet and sour sauce, which often times is too thick and pasty for my liking was actually way too thin and tasted like it was watered down. It also didn't taste like sweet and sour sauce either.  The rice was good - fluffy and well cooked.  The broccoli was well cooked too - crisp and not too over done.  Those are the only two things I can say about the meal.  I couldn't eat the tofu (appearance aside, it was also terribly cooked), and I left over half my meal on the plate.    Two of the other people I was with also did not really like their meals either, noting the chicken tasting freezer burnt and/or overdone in old oil.    The fourth person in our party said their meal 'wasn't bad'.  The whole place smells of fryer oil as well.    Super disappointed.",

Spring rolls were soggy and almost completely cabbage, plus having an overall odd taste. Wontons were bland as wallpaper paste. The dumplings were ok, but nothing special. My partner ordered pho which just....never came. We waited. And waited. The server kept going back into the kitchen, and we'd think, \"ok maybe now?\" Nothing. Finally having had enough we just told this kid to forget it, we'd pay for what we had eaten. He seemed surprised and his was response was \"oh, there was a misunderstanding, I think it's almost done\". Um, what misunderstanding? We were the only 2 people there. In the duration that we were there ONE person came in to pick up takeout.  In short, don't bother. There are MANY better options for Americanized Chinese in the area.",

    "text": "We came here this past Friday after my husband's tattoo appointment.  We walked in and nobody greeted us, but another table of diners said it was a sit anywhere. It is a BYOB establishment, which I wish I had known previous to entering and sitting down. The woman who waited on us said we could run around the corner to the Wine and Spirits shop, but we declined.  The drinks available are canned sodas (pop to the Yinzer population). The iced tea was a bit weak. The Dragon and Phoenix soup was extremely delicious. We ordered the Pu Pu Platter. The Teriyaki Beef that is on most all platters was not some thin strip of beef you can see through. It was thick and juicy while still being thin enough to skewer. The fried wontons didn't have a lot of insides to them, but they were very crispy. The duck sauce tasted homemade and I just wanted to eat a whole bowl of the stuff. The spring rolls have pork in them (you are told ahead of time about this) and were crispy but not fried.  We inquired about the Emperor Shrimp (chicken was available as well). They said it was their specialty and it was a combination of General Tso's and Sweet and Sour. Let me tell you, this was amazing. There was a spicy heat to it that was superbly balanced by the sweetness. I have eaten in a lot of Chinese restaurants and I have tasted nothing like this EVER!! My husband was definitely in love. The portions are nice sized and great if you are hungry or definite leftovers if you are not. I made mention of my enjoyment of the duck sauce and they enclosed a whole container of the stuff in our leftover bag. They also gave us some more white rice as we only had a small portion left from our meal. We are in Dormont frequently and will definitely be coming back with my BYOB.",

So we headed back up the street to Mekong. We assumed it would be the expected americanized chinese food like everything else in the south hills..meh, but were pleasantly surprised to find a smattering of vietnamese dishes on the menu. We were greeted with friendly service, complimentary tea and ordered the Pho with high hopes. We were not disappointed. The pho was outstanding. I'm honestly surprised to see the negative reviews. PIF and I are no strangers to Pho and agree mekong might have the best in the south hills. While I can't speak to the quality of the more mainstream chinese on their menu, I was impressed and will be back for more pho very soon!",

Our server, Lisa couldn't have been nicer (I'm assuming she is also the owner).  It wasn't as crowded as we expected because of the construction that just finished on Potomac.

    "text": "When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh in 2014, Mekong offered authentic-tasting Vietnamese food that was to die for. Everything tasted fresh and the owners handmade the noodles daily, which made them irresistible. We especially loved the shrimp eggrolls as the dough was also homemade and they always came piping hot with wonderful soy sauce on the side. Although the interior wasn't anything special, it was a delicious little spot in Dormont and we enjoyed tasting every homemade item on the menu. However, something has definitely changed. It seems like they have gotten new ownership. Gone are the handmade noodles, the fresh-rolled eggrolls, and the authentic Vietnamese flavor. These have been replaced with cheap, frozen, takeout-quality meals that you can get at any run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet. Actually, a Chinese buffet would be a better choice because it would be much less expensive. The worst casualty is the shrimp eggrolls, which we previously loved so much. The stale pastries are now filled with the chewiest, dirtiest, and most low-quality shrimp you could imagine. They are flavorless and you could find tastier eggrolls in the frozen food section of Market District. You should especially stay away from these \"shrimp\" eggrolls.  Mekong is now an overpriced, low quality pan-Asian takeout restaurant, just like countless others in Pittsburgh. I gave it two stars because the hostess, who is always there, is sweet and does her best to make sure you are well taken care of. However, the food is absolutely no longer worth the wait or the price. You may as well find a Magic Wok and pay less.",

    "text": "\"We Do Not Guarantee Our Food!\"   And it shows.  OMG WORST FOOD EVER!  Sitting at my table with this mess infront of me.   The General Tso chicken consists of frozen nuggets with factory processed sauce poured over.   The vegetable fried rice is over cooked white rice with red and green peppers,  the egg roll is an undercooked spring roll.   I specifically asked if they served REAL  egg rolls and was told yes. Hot and Sour Soup was thick like lumpy gravy and had only the flavor of black pepper.   It was void of any thing but greasy brown liquid.  I had been looking forward to Chinese all week,  I am so very disappointed.   I called the restaurant to complain and then again to ask for my money back,  which I NEVER do.   I believe in buyer beware but this was SO bad I actually called and said, \"Hi, this is,  gave my address, again.   I want my money back.\" I was told that they don't guarantee their food.   I asked for a name so I could credit the quote but was turned down flat.  I was also informed that  I was not being helped because I was mean about how I talked about the food her mom cooks and feeds to them daily.  For the 30 dollars I got ripped off I recieved a traditional white box of General Tso chicken,  a traditional white box of white rice, 3 undercooked spring rolls and 2 LG.  Containers of sweet and sour soup. Small portions as well for the money.   Keep going through the yelp list for somewhere else.",

My advice to the owners is to sell Vietnamese food only and they will start to get better business and better reviews. If I were to rate them on their Chinese food only I would actually give them 2 out of 5 stars but if I were to only rate their Vietnamese food I would give them 4 out of 5 stars.  The most recent time I went there I got \"Buddha's Delight\" and also a \"Vietnamese Hoagie\". As I suspected, the Vietnamese hoagie was delicious but the Chinese entree was well below average even though it had a lot of bamboo and baby corn which I loved. When I went before I got vegetable Pho and vegetable chow mein. The Pho soup was delicious but the other dish was a fail in my opinion. The main issue with the Chinese dishes is that although the sauce is tasty the vegetables are past their prime and sometimes aren't cooked enough which renders them sometimes bitter and a little too raw.   I still think this restaurant can have its place in Dormont since their Vietnamese dishes are delicious and that is an underrepresented cuisine in that area. Hopefully they will still be around to implement those changes I suggested and save their business.",

    "text": "Pretty average in my opinion. Nothing crazy special but nothing specifically bad either. We were in for lunch during the week so it was not busy. Our server was very nice and helped us promptly. Our food came out quickly. The cheese wontons were very thick and difficult to eat because of this. I thought it would be more like crab Rangoon type of wonton but it was not like this at all. I would not get this again. My pho broth was flavorful with many veggies, just how I like it. My husband liked his general tso's chicken but thought egg drop soup was oily. Prices reasonable. Would stop in here again for some veggie pho when I'm in the mood since it's a convenient location, inexpensive and good I but would probably like to try other places first.",

When the food arrived I was brought walnut chicken instead of orange, but decided to roll with it. I was pleasantly surprised that the mistake turned out to be a win in my book.

    "text": "Meh. Just okay.  We ordered this for delivery because we wanted to try something in the area other than Katana. The Yelp app would not cooperate; fortunately, their website has online ordering too. Another cool feature is you can pay thru PayPal on their site, and add a tip too, so when they come to the door you grab your food and you're good to go! No more trying to sign your name in your palm or on your spouses back! Yippee! Technology!   On their website, the entrees do not specify whether or not they come with rice, even when you add it to your cart. So, I ordered 2 general tsos chicken dinners, an order of (2) egg rolls, and a small side of both fried rice and white rice. Well, it turns out they do come with a small side of white rice, so no need for all those extra orders of rice. *facepalm*  The order of egg rolls were fantastic and I wished I had ordered 2 for each of us because we gobbled them up in 2 seconds.    The chicken was just okay. Some pieces were just super soft and a bit gamey if I'm being honest. Also, it was notably much spicier than any other general Tsos we have had so keep that in mind! The fried rice was very good, and was actually rice fried with vegetables and egg, not just white rice with soy sauce dumped on it as so many places do now.  My other problem other than the 'eh chicken' was that unfortunately, when our order arrived, one of the paper takeout containers of chicken was on its side and the sauce got all over everything. Not a huge dealbreaker, but not the best thing to pull out a bunch of soggy, sticky containers that you could otherwise eat out of. It was probably an honest mistake, but hopefully they are able to pack it better in the future.   Im not quite sold on my first experience, but I know where I'm getting my egg rolls! Haha",

I also thought the chicken tasted weird. I clearly felt fine after eating it, but I'm wondering if it was frozen and then cooked, which makes it get a little mushy.   Funny enough, I'm still open to trying the Pho portion of the restaurant, which is new, but I still worry that it may not have the flavor I'm looking for. Crossing my fingers that dish will be better!",

So we're familiar with what it normally is... this general tso's chicken was *and I shit you not* those flat breaded chicken fingers that are normally on kids menus, floating in globs of that orange gelatinous duck sauce.

    "text": "A sad day for the Chinese food lovers of Pittsburgh.  Although I live in Cleveland these days, we'd still make excuses to pass through Pgh anytime we were within 50 miles, strictly to hit Mekong.  But last night we were in for a rude surprise.  First off, we called while still a couple hours out, and got a strange voice on the other end of the line.  Well, maybe they hired someone new.  Then when we got there, we noticed a subtle change in the decor.  And the menus were different.  But most importantly, no Theresa or her husband to greet us.  Things went downhill from there.  I ordered my usual, kung pao chicken, which I order at such pyrotechnic levels of heat, it would make a grown man cry.  But Theresa and I had come to an understanding over the years, such that when I walked in the door, she'd go to the kitchen door and yell, \"HEY, MOM....IT'S THAT CRAZY GUY!!!\"  I got it with hot 'n' sour soup, another slice of Mekong yumminess.  The soup was obviously wrong, but not unpleasant.  Nowhere near as good as normal.  Then came the kung pao, which not only wasn't spicy (by my standards), it was just....wrong.  Like the stuff you'd get from the worst kind of generic Chinese restaurant.  Nothing special about it at all.  My wife got her usual, broccoli and chicken lo mein, and it was awful.  I tasted it, and while my kung pao was no better or worse than average Chinese fare, hers was like what you'd get at the mall food court.  Horrible.  On top of everything else, the prices are all higher than what Mekong used to charge, so now you're paying more money for below-average Chinese.  I don't know what happened to the original family...since we only hit Mekong about once every couple months now, we never heard anything.  Does anyone have any information?  Did they move and hopefully start a restaurant elsewhere?  Did something happen to the chef, Theresa's mom?  What gives???  RIP Mekong.  Our most salient reason to visit Pgh is now gone.",

    "text": "NEW MANAGEMENT as of summer 2015. Short review: food, price and service each dropped a star.  Long(ish) review: Before I really get going let me say that the food is still decent, a little blander than before, needs a bit of salt in the noodle water, but I expect them to eventually work out those kinks. The Pho was over cooked and served with the plate of basil and limes that are supposed to accompany the dish. It was over flavored with black pepper and cilantro stems. If that had been the only issue I wouldn't be writing this. But there's more. -1 star for the food, with the potential to earn it back.  As for reasons to reduce my rating, Let's start with price since that's a simple one. The food here was always on the high side, but I'd gotten used to asian being $3 more in Pittsburgh than it is anywhere else. The thing that hurts this review are the additional $2 they now charge for any change you make to the dish. I understand charging a little extra for people who want double on the proteins, but $2 for a handful of veggies when the plate is already $12? No thank you, -1 star, and frankly is indicative of the attitude driving the next sad problem.  The service was an issue. One person manning the restaurant at dinner time for starters, but I can understand that when the place is empty. (That should have been a clue) She was openly rude to customers on the phone while we were sitting not 10 feet away. We were the only people in the place except for one takeout order and one delivery that came in while we waited and it took more than 40 minutes to get food from when we sat down. The old welcoming family owned vibe is completely and utterly gone. -1 heartbreaking to lose star.   All in all, for 3 people we spent $50 for a middle of the road meal in an unwelcoming, empty restaurant that, I fear, has put its better years behind it. I'll probably give the place a try again in 6-12 months because I'm a sucker for Vietnamese food, here's hoping that trip goes better...  Good luck.",
