I ordered their new Cinnamon French toast, which was to die for!  It reminded me of eating Cinnabon--which I also love!  I love that each table gets it's own coffee pot! Service was prompt!  I really enjoyed my meal at this location and plan to visit again next time I am in Pittsburgh!",

When he took my order he sounded half awake which is scary because I am allergic to walnuts and pork so when I told him to tell the cooks not to cross contaminate he didn't really seem to get it. I told him I wanted pancakes that were not cooked in the same grease as the nut batter pancakes (I think they're called honey nut or something) he said ok. I also told him I wanted 4 strips of turkey bacon bucause I can't eat sausage or regular bacon. My meal came on a greasy plate w 2 turkey bacon strips and 2 sausage links. I told him I wanted the turkey bacon again he said he would get it no apology. took another 30 min for the rest of the bacon it was cold when I got it. I went to the front and found that he had charged me 2.50 for the bacon that should have come w my meal in the first place. Lady at te front said she couldn't do anything about it... Frustrated I pd the 15 dollar bill, that was only my meal, that's crazy expensive for greasy American food! I went to the ladies bathroom and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks there was paper all over the damp floor and poo on the toilet seats. Don't go here.",

Our waiter on a Saturday night was super helpful, super fast, and very friendly.    And seriously, how can you go wrong with cinnabon anything?  Both the cinnabon pancakes and the french toast are amazing.      My husband got a non-breakfast meal (gasp!) - a bowl of potato soup and a roast beef-type sandwich which  he said he liked a lot.  I've never personally tried anything non-breakfast there, and am still hesitant.  Usually restaurants are good at one thing, and IHOP is good at breakfast.",

    "text": "Note: It doesn't look as if they're open 24 hours yet. As of now, they're open until 12am at the latest.   After the less-than-stellar experience we had at our first Robinson IHOP visit (check my reviews), I was sent a $20 gift certificate upon filing a complaint through IHOP's website. Now as my second IHOP review will attest, our experience was improved, but we decided to use the gift certificate at this East End Hill location. Hey, it's new y'know?  Yeah, what a neighborhood for an IHOP. Ya think they'd have stuck it out in West Mifflin or Bethel Park. You know, out in the sticks?   It's an itty bit tricky getting into the lot off the highway. Be careful.  I gotta say it: This IHOP beats the one in Robinson. The service was exemplary and as friendly as could be. Two workers who were on their way out greeted us and held the doors open for us. They aim to please here and seem to really, really want to make a good impression, which they did.  Our server Dave was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and was terrific at his job overall. The entire staff seemed happy to be working there. There was a feeling that they all want this IHOP to take off.   Based on our visit, it should be a flying Chinese dragon of a success.   The place was way busier than the Robinson restaurant, yet no one seemed to miss a note.   What did we order? Oh yeah...  I went with the simple pleasure of a Ham and Egg Melt with fruit on the side (why is their fruit so damn fresh and refreshing?), a Splashberry to drink, and a Banana Crepe for dessert.   What else could I say about such fare? It was all...good, good stuff and served to illustrate why IHOP is becoming so popular.   I still can't get over the scope of their menu. They have shrimp? Burgers? Steak?  I almost got steak and eggs, by the way.  Why do I feel like I'm at Diesel when I order an IHOP Splasher. I know more than a few people that would put some spirits in 'em.    Lady Kay got the Corned Beef Hash and Chocolate Chocolate Chip Pancakes and liked them both. Maybe I can coax her to write a review.   Yeah, this IHOP works for me. Stop in, and request Dave if you are able. He'll take care of you.",

To be fair, we didn't order on the breakfast menu, but I was really unimpressed with the dinner choices.  We had a good server, and I love that they bring you a pot of coffee for the table, but the good news stopped there.  I got a chicken salad, and it was full of those little nasty chunks of chicken you buy by the freezer bag at Walmart.  My husband got a cheeseburger, which was small, flat, and nothing to write home about.  I'll probably give this place another shot for pancakes at some point, as that is their specialty, but I'll not return for dinner.  I think we chose this place because we wanted something a little less expensive, but hopefully better than Eat n Park, and it was actually neither.  It was also a little odd to me that there's a huge \"NO WEAPONS\" sign on the door when you walk in.  I really hope people aren't bringing weapons into pancake restaurants.",

    "text": "I came here with my boyfriend for National Pancake Day around 9:30 am and had a wait of about 20 minutes, which was to be expected. Aside from that, we didn't experience any of the long waits mentioned in other reviews, but we did go on a more unusual day. Once seated, our drink orders were taken pretty quickly, but the waiter swept away before we could say anything else. The wait for the drinks was a little long, but understandable considering how busy it was. I got a hot chocolate, which filled about 2/3 of a tiny mug. The rest was whipped cream. The chocolate wasn't bad, but the amount was a little disappointing. The waiter had disappeared to deliver some drinks to other tables but came back soon after to take our order. Even though he must have been busy and stressed, he was welcoming and friendly toward us. The food--3 pancakes each and some sausage for my boyfriend--came not long after, and someone else came by to check on us. IHOP pancakes are always good, and I love experimenting with the syrups. To my dismay, we had two containers of butter pecan and no boysenberry, but I didn't really mind that much. However, our table was also missing sugar. My boyfriend didn't want to bother anyone so he just added extra cream to his coffee. We received the check as we were finishing up.",

I'm not a big sweets person so fancy pants pancakes, french toast and waffles doesn't impress me. But for a place that specializes in breakfast, you'd think their breakfast would have a little more oomph in it than Denny's or Eat n Park.  I got the breakfast sampler. You get bacon, eggs, sausage, ham and pancakes x 2 plus hash browns. You don't get toast. You can sub the pancakes for the toast but I can't help but feel cheated subbing my pancakes for toast for my eggs. Everything was tasty, but my over medium eggs were barely over easy. And considering I had to share my toast with my friend for our eggs, the toast to dippy egg ratio was pretty messed up. Yeah, I said dippy eggs....my folks are yinzers so even a few words have sunk in to this Zonie.  She got the french toast breakfast. Her eggs were like mine....supposed to be over medium but barely over easy. Everything tasted good, though. Her french toast was fluffy and sweet and we poured gobs of blueberry syrup onto it.  She also got this flavored coffee that she wasn't impressed with, other than the chocolate chips and whipped cream. Flavored coffees with chocolate chips and whipped cream doesn't impress me, either.  Our only real complaints were that it took over thirty minutes from when we sat down before we got our meals. We showed up at 10:30 so maybe we were at the tail end of their busy shift. The waiter was on the dining room floor the whole time so I know he wasn't in the back rolling silverware or ignoring us to do sidework. He was also super friendly and cheerful.  Honestly, for the price, I'd rather get my no-name somewhere else.",

    "text": "Ok, as I write this review I realize IHop is not the finest-of-dining establishments, but I still feel like there is a certain-albeit minimal- expectation, and this experience didn't even live up to that.   We got there, were seated and the waitress took our drink order. So far, pretty good. Then we ordered. ..  Taking our order the waitress did not write it down, which I know a lot of servers don't anymore. If you are a seasoned server and can remember all that, go for it! I applaud a person being able to remember the orders of multiple people, the changes, substitutions and all that and not get wrong.  I didn't know until our food came that our waitress was not a seasoned professional and could not handle the order of two people without getting it incorrect.   I got an omelet without the onions. My bf got a custom kind of thing were you get to pick two of this, two of that or whatever. He also ordered and extra 2 pieces of sausage. The food comes and the first tip off that she was new to the serving world was that she asked us if the pancakes looked like the pancakes we ordered. We were confused, obviously, so she explained that she knew he ordered blueberry pancakes but she didn't know if the cakes she brought out to him were blueberry or  not. REALLY! Being the private eye that I am I looked at the pancakes and said no, they are not blueberry. Being the easy going guy the bf is, he said it was fine. Problem #2 he noticed he didn't get his sausage so he asked about he reminded her. She admitted she forgot and said she would place the order for the extra sausage and because she forgot and the pancakes were wrong she would not charge us.   We were all but done eating by the time the sausages came but the best part is when she brought the forgotten links she asked, AS SHE WAS PUTTING DOWN THE PLATE, if we wanted our check now. I always thought it was customary to let the guest eat before paying!   (Also, keep in mind that by this time she had not checked in on us once! Not for water of coffee refills or even just to see if our food was ok! And the poor bf was dehydrated because I drank all his water after I finished mine.)  He just says oh sure that's fine (because he's the easy going one), and noticed she did charge us for the sausage, Now, it was $1.59 so it's not about the money but the principle. He was going to pay it, I am the other hand am all about the principle. Still not angry (upset, annoyed, miffed or any negative emotion) mind you I showed her the bill and asked about the charge. She looks at me like I was crazy and trying to rip her off, rolls her eyes and says \"OK fine I'll take it off.\" and storms away. All those negative emotions I was not feeling, I am beginning to feel. So to avoid conflict we wait calmly for our pay and proceed to the register to pay.   Another server, the one seating and taking the final bills, comes over and takes our check. I had a couple of gift cards, which is why we went, and she tries to process the transaction. It apparently wasn't working so the girl tries again this time telling the computer it sucks and muttering annoyances, jabbing the touch so hard it was rocking. The bill was $18 and some change.  All I wanted was the dollar and change to for a tip for the horrible dinner, BUT NOOOO I have to argue with the girl to get my Dollar and change! Now, I don't know if I was in the right or not but I was NOT going back after that bad experience and didn't feel like I should have to forfeit my change. In the end I did get my change, left it and a couple extra singles for the tip and left.",

Maybe there wasn't a manager on duty. Maybe even a line cook or two called out sick? You see, I can only speculate because no one ever offered us a reason as to why it took over 50 minutes for our food to arrive. There were somewhere around 15 servers for a half-empty restaurant, and yet no one around us had food either, and many were still holding menus and looking around, even though they were there before us. Our waitress was new, which I am always extra patient about, but she was rude and simply didn't use common sense. On the way out, another woman approached a server and asked why her food hadn't arrived after 45 minutes, and the server just shrugged. The food was okay, but not great. I had ordered a side of bacon which didn't show up with the meal. When I asked about it, the server told me I wasn't allowed to get that side because someone told her the meal doesn't come with bacon. I said \"but I specifically ordered it as a side.\" She said \"You could've done that I guess if you paid extra for it, but it's too late now.\" Then right as she walked away, 2 sad, limp strips of bacon were brought out on a plate for me. Will never be returning here.",

They looked good but as I ate them, I realized they were BURNT but the burntness was disguised by the cream cheese drizzle on the pancakes!!

As we were waiting outside one of the \"chefs\" came out for a smoke break and his clothes were FILTHY. Every fiber in my body wanted to get back in the car and leave but my husband and friend really wanted to eat here. This ihop hasn't even been open for a year but it definitely didn't look new.   Customer service (0/5): HORRIBLE! Our waitress had an incredibly bad attitude. She was super rude and was acting like we were wasting her time by taking our orders. I'm really curious how she got the job because there was nothing friendly or personable about her demeanor. You know those type of people that NEVER smile and everyday is a bad day for them... that's our waitress. When she came to our table she didn't introduce herself, she just said, \"What do you guys want!\" Oh, and they didn't clean off the table before we sat down. There was syrup everywhere. She didn't check on us until we were done with our meals. We also didn't get a refill until we were done with our meals. I was thirty as a mug!   Food (2/5): one word - Sloppy! I ordered chicken strips and \"seasoned\" fries. I don't really like breakfast food that much. When my plate came, it looked like they just threw it on the plate. Their version of \"seasoned\" fries is regular fries with a sprinkle of season salt on top. SUPER LAME! On top of the lame fries they only gave me a few.   Never coming back...ever!",

We were seated relatively fast but no waitress came over for about 15 minutes or so. When she finally came over we ordered our drinks. I asked her what the soup of the day was. She said she didn't know but she'd be happy to go and check. We waited and waited. Not only did she never bring our drinks but she never came back at all. She left the restaurant completely. We learned this from whoever came to take our order, I  think as she was the hostess. Well, after having waited an hour all together with no food we decided to get up and eat somewhere else. I've had some other issues there but this takes the cake.",

    "text": "I was so happy when I heard that this location had opened. We patiently waited a few months for all of the hype to die down and for all the kinks of opening a new restaurant to be gone before we went.   So Tamika and I went on a weekday around 8am. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks. A couple minutes later our drinks came. We then ordered our food. I got steak and hash browns with a stack of pancakes. Tamika got some type of breakfast platter with pancakes, eggs and corn beef hash. My steak tasted like liver but the hash browns were tasty and the pancakes were delicious! Tamika liked her platter but ,had to repeatedly remind the server to bring her corn beef hash. It was gross once she got it! It looked like it came out of a can!   The service sucked. Our waitress had really crappy attitude! Once we got our food our waitress vanished off the face of the earth for at least a half an hour.   What I don't get is by 8:45 there were about 20 to 30 people waiting to be seated and they had a whole empty section but wouldn't seat anyone there. WTH? It's like when you wait in a long line to get into a club and when you finally get inside there's only 5 people in the whole club.   I had to constantly ask for a refill on my OJ and Tamika's coffee. I love IHOP and have been to quite a few in different states but this location was a complete disappointment. I would have been much happier at Pamela's or even the Original Pancake House!   Insider tip: Get here between 8 and 8:30 to avoid the morning rush.",

If you don't want one of the two toppings, you really don't have much of a salad. It seems EVERYTHING they serve has pancake batter in it. I can't be certain of that (other than what they tell you on their commercials. Putting pancake batter in their eggs to make them more fluffy and cause their gluten-free customers a painful afternoon.), however, my bun for my burger was oddly heavy-hmmm...perhaps pancake batter?? Our server really needed a lesson in proper customer service. She wasn't mean or nasty. She didn't mess up the order. But, what did she do..well...She brought everything to the table's edge for us to pass out to the appropriate people. She brought a hot plate and told us not to touch it, but, didn't put it in front of the customers. She expected us to know what we wanted almost before we sat down. It was odd. Not accustomed to being waiting on in that fashion.  I might be old fashion, but I like when the server puts the plate in front of me as well as collect it from in front of me instead of me doing the work for her to come by and grab the dishes. It was just odd. I don't expect much, but a little more goes a long way.",

Then we put in an order of mozz sticks. They came, the waiter said 'we're just waiting on the marinara sauce'. We sat there for about 10-15mins and decided, well, we should just eat them as it. Oh, and did I mention we never received our plates, napkins or silverware?!?! The waiter never came back to take our 'regular' order. Oh, and can I say the smell of weed was all around us !! It would become more potent at times, someone had to have had a blunt hidden or something. My friend and I said that place was like when the teacher is out sick and the classroom is pure chaos cuz the substitute doesn't give a fudge. And the wait staff had their coats on !!

Clearly there were too many of them hanging around, but never had my water refilled. I've heard good things about IHOP but my experience was nothing of the sort. Ordered crepes with eggs poached hard (the menus does say, anyway you want them!) when they arrived there was about a half jar of Nutella on top of the crepes, which made them difficult to get down without scraping them off first. The eggs were not even poached medium. I had to send them back and reminded them to please poach hard. Almost like a hard boiled egg, they apologized and later retuned with the same eggs. Left them in my plate. Paid with a tip and left. Won't return.",

I am not a local.. visited from San Francisco, CA and had way better service at this location then ANY IHOP in my area!!   WAIT - PLACE WAS PACKED! Regardless, it was a Sunday and in SF you're guaranteed to have a 30min + wait.. BUT NO! Only took less then 10 min. to seat my group (3 people total)   SERVER - His name was TYJUAN! Its been about a week since I've been back to SF and YES I remember him because he was just that darn GOOD!!! - Greeted our table with name and took drink orders - Got our drinks asap and provides us a new set of straws because the first set go wet LOL! - Took our order without making us feel like we were being rushed, he also made recommendations to make our choices from the menu just a tad bit better, and YES his recommendations we perfection. - Provided us extra napkins and ketchup without even asking(excuse me while I pretend he is the perfect nephew I never had! (': LOL) - Checked up on our table twice and offered to-go boxes before providing us the bill with his closing thank you.  FOOD - Country fried steak was perfect and delicious!   CHECK OUT - No line.. so super fast and easy pay!  OVERALL! THIS IHOP IS TERRIFIC!   And most likely you will not see this but if you do read this Tyjuan, my group and I thank you so much for the terrific service and I hope you stay blessed! (o:",

    "text": "You know, I used to have this out of town romance that left a sweetness in my mouth.  The only way I could get a fix was if I left Pittsburgh behind me and headed for warmer climates.  Not so much anymore, you made me happy IHOP with finally opening your doors a few years back here in the region.  As for the most recent visit to your lovely location outside of Greenfield/Squirrel Hill, there were many ups, and a few downs.    I was going to do the ups first and then do the downs, but they kind of mix together so I'm just gonna go through it all at once.  Congrats on finally being open 24 hours!  Not so big congrats to advertise it.  I didn't notice it on the sign if you were open 24 hours, and the parking lot looks shady when you pull up and see no cars in the lot and you have to do a parking lot circle to make sure.  The lettering you use on the door is quite small too.  Even with my glasses, I was still squinting to see if you were open.  As soon as I saw '24' on the door, the car went into park and I was heading for the door.  As late as it was at night, my friend and I were the only two people besides the workers in the building.  Big plus for us, no wait.  Service was super fast if you couldn't have guessed.  Here's something I learned as well, the menu changes at 10 p.m.  Not a big deal for me as I was getting pancakes, as it is the International House of Pancakes.  As for my friend, she was really hoping to get the garden crepes.  So when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'Sure, I'll make it.'  Big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.  One thing, my sausage did end up looking like bacon...but I ate it anyway.  OK, so this has to be categorized as a down, there's no way to put a happy spin on it.  The bathrooms...what in the world went on in the bathroom?  It looks as if somebody was having a battle royale in the one.  Maybe somebody was fighting a demon much like they do in the show Charmed.  I mean thank god I didn't mistake the Styrofoam cups for having anything else but soap in them.  Also, this place is really showing it's wear.  It hasn't been open that long, but it sure needs a bit of TLC and updating.",

I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and to my surprise there was one of the workers in there putting her hair up and left green goo all over the sick as well as hair everywhere. When I came out I got ran over by a waitress that told me to watch where I was going and to get out of the way of people working, um Hello. We asked our waiter for the check and 20 minutes later he still never showed up. When we went to the counter to ask for our check and pay we were told that our server gives us our check and to pay him. I explained to the man that he never came around and then ten minutes later our check came and I paid for it. Never again the servers need better attitudes and the food needs checked",

They eventually cleaned those, but we waited at least 15 mins before we were addressed by any waitress.  We asked for a to-go cup at the end.  Another 10 mins wait, and we just left cause we needed to go.  Foodwise.  4 syrups to choose. 2 of them tasted like medicine. (strawberry and blueberry). The other two (old fashioned / butter pecan) syrups were ok.  We had a steak omelet. The steak meat was alright.  \"Double blueberry pancake\" was very sweet.  The only good thing is mocha-flavored cold coffee has free refill.  The portion was big, I didn't touch my three pancakes that go with my omelet.   At the end of the day, IHOP breakfast is typical American breakfast. Big, lots of potatoes, thick pancakes, very sweet drinks and syrup, and it's cheap.  But be honest, I rather have one great benedict than a big table of so-so.   American breakfast is not for me, so that's a 4.  The food was ok, but not wow, makes it a 3. Slow service makes it a 2.  So a \"2\" it is.  Has \"guest wifi\", but not working.",

A dejected waitress will lead you to a stained booth with a slightly sticky table.   Get a coffee. Yes, it's mediocre, but it's late. There's nothing else to choose from.   Ask the waitress if there is red #40 in the strawberry topping.  \"What's that a dye or something, hunny?\" \"Yes.\" \"Probably. Everything is processed here\", said the waitress in the same tone as if to?say \"do you want the slop or not, piggy?\"  You do want the slop. You are desperate. It's late.  Order something. It's gonna be bland or slightly plastic-y tasting. It's better than the emptiness that was there before.   Your waitress keeps the drinks filled and stops by a few times. She does the minimum without a smile or kind word. You wonder if this is standard service or if something happened to her.   You get up to pay and see a customer loudly complain that his takeout meal costs too much (it doesn't). The waitress calmly responds to this nonsense, gently telling him to pay or kick rocks.   Now you understand the joyless waitress and just hope to make it out of the restaurant without laughing in the face of Complaint Man when he asks the waitress:  \"Can you break a $50?\"",

Another occasion I ordered a Pepsi and when the server brought my Pepsi it was clearly diet, when I told her it tasted like diet and if she didn't mind changing it I would appreciate it and she told me \"no, that is Pepsi, I poured it so I know\" and she walked away. I finished the diet and asked for a refill of Pepsi and when she returned it was in fact Pepsi, so I knew that it wasn't just because the drink tasted funny. Either way I was just taken back that she wouldn't just switch out my drink in the first place. This was a laughable situation but.... ehhhh still not idea.

Our server was clearly new to the job, and seemed untrained and very overwhelmed. He kept forgetting basics, like silverware and filling drinks. When our food was brought out, it was brought in parts on different plates. Sides being brought separately from the eggs/pancakes, etc. After eating, we waited 20 mins for the server to come back and acknowledge we were done so we could get the checks. Our checks were separated per person, and the server was very unorganized with our checks. We were not given itemized receipts, as is normal, we were only given a receipt with the price and tip lines. When the server gave us our cards back, he picked up money from the table that someone was leaving as a tip, asked if it was for him, then pocketed it. I don't know how people are trained nowadays, but I was always taught that servers do not touch a tip on the table until the customers leave. We paid and got out of there as fast as possible, the server was upset because his other tables were complaining as well. Food was great though!",

As other reviews noted, the inconsitency has taken its toll:  the restaurant is rarely busy, even on weekends.  Given its prime location, one has to wonder why this place cannot get its act together.   There have been times when an individual server has been attentive and profesional.  But too often, the servers are disinterested and inattentive.  Sometimes the food has been delivered, hot and tasty.  More often, it's cold and badly cooked. Silverware often is not set and I have actually gone searching for my own utensils on more than one occasion.   And it's questionable whether the staff knows how to properly bus a table after service.  I don't know how often a manager is on-site, since the staff seems to hide in the kitchen (rarely exiting with food), or gabbing near the register.    I am a forgiving customer and I want to like this place. It's close to my home and the prices are reasonable.  In the final analysis, it's hard to blame anyone but the management, which does not teach basic food service skills to the young staff, nor exercise oversight of operations.",

My moms hash browns never showed up. Also when we got our food we never got silverware! They offered us plastic silverware! Ok so we got ready to get our check and leave and the manager said he would take half off of our check. A half hour later our server came to our table and we said we were waiting for the manager to bring our check back. She went and checked on it and it was never touched. We've been in iHop for 3 hours. I was very unpleased by my visit to iHop today.",

There was no host at the station when I walked in, but someone walking by did seat me immediately.   She was wearing flip flops, which I thought was weird for a restaurant, but whatever.  She was friendly.  The server came over shortly thereafter.  She did an excellent job - friendly and attentive.    My breakfast, though, was absolutely dreadful.   The pancakes were ok at best, but were drowned in what was essentially a couple of Smucker's ice cream toppings.   That one is probably on me - I should have ordered them plain.  The eggs, which I ordered scrambled with cheese, didn't even taste like eggs.  They had a very weird texture - grainy and rubbery at the same time.    The bacon, ordered well done, was flabby.  The hash browns were a sad, unseasoned, brick of under-cooked potato mush.",

We ordered chocolate milk for my daughter who is 3 years old,  the milk came to us spoiled and made her ill later in the day.  We also told our waitress about it and did not get an \"I'm sorry\" just a \"well do you want something else\".  I also heard another table order chocolate milk about 10 minutes after ours arrived and I warned them that our milk came spoiled and so they should check before letting their kids drink it.  Sure enough when their milk came the milk was spoiled as well, meaning the kitchen staff did not throw away potentially harmful product and kept providing it to customers.  When our bill came we were still expected to pay for the spoiled milk, even after I asked our waitress at the register and tried to address it.    Needless to say I am NOT thrilled with the level of customer service I received.  Not once did a manger come to try and talk to us and make things right, not once did our server apologize and offer anything to help, and I had to deal with a toddler throwing up on the way home because her stomach hurt after eating at this establishment.  It is unacceptable.",

My companion, who has 2% body fat (seriously annoying) was freezing, but picked ihop and really wanted their fffffooooddddddd. Okkkkkaaayyy.  I had a fantastic Egg White Vegetable omelette, which was light, fluffy, and topped with fresh diced tomatoes, melty Jack cheese, lightly cooked spinach, and a perfect avocado. It included a yummy-looking fresh fruit cup, which I took home. The restaurant was so \"chilly,\" I wolfed my omelette, which was not an enjoyable experience. The other diner did the same with The Sampler, which had 2 egs, bacon, ham, and sausage, and two pancakes (Not hot. Or even warm). I had just finished 24 + ounces of coffee, and didn't order a drink. The other diner, however, said it was decent coffee; nothing special.   The ladies rest room was dirty. While at the sink, a male employee (who didn't knock or yell in), burst in, and trying to hold door open, grabbed the \"wet floor\" sign, folded it, and pinned it in the door. He never said a word. Not a one. Thoroughly unprofessional. Had I been a jerk, i could've given him/ihop all kinds of legal woes.  The topper was the server, Jeanette, returned with change from the bill. She apologized for being short $.34. I've been a server, and in the hospitality industry a long time, albeit part time (quit last year). I have/would never say that to a customer.  Period. I would tell the shift manager or GM, but I would absolutely NEVER do that to a customer.   I will NOT return. Not even the omelette could get me back here.",

Because it was so busy our waitress was just constantly cycling around. They had runners that would bring the food out so it came out faster and hotter than normal. The churro pancakes are AWESOME but i def didn't need the side of hashbrowns lol i will say though... the \"runners\".... one was actually running around and it stressed us out. a few times she actually did run into someone. the few seconds she saves running vs walking isn't that significant. It creates an anxious atmosphere from her running. I didn't see the rest of them do that. Next time i think walking or fast walking is sufficient. When they gave us the coffee container it was almost gone so i think if they checked that before that would be helpful or have someone walking around refilling coffees. Overall good experience and it seems like this IHOP is improving compared to the past visits we have had.",

    "text": "I have been hearing people rave about IHOP for years and was so excited to finally eat here. I had a coupon for free pancakes and decided to try it out. I have to say I was extremely let down from my experience.  As soon as I pulled in to the empty parking lot, during what should of been the dinner rush, I was concerned. The atmosphere, or lack of, once inside the building didn't give me any more hope. The bathrooms were disguisting. None of the toilets had been flushed, toilet paper was all over the floor and there was hardly any soap. After seeing the bathroom I almost decided to leave and I wish I would of. My daughter and I were the only table in the resturant for half of our meal, whixh half of our meal consisted of just waiting for our food. Then one other table came and was sat directly besides us even though the whole place was empty. I ordered an omelette which only came with one side, 7.99 plus .99 for each topping. Peppers and onions were listed together as one with one price but I was charged separately for them even tho the menu says papers & onion .99. So now my omelette became 9.99. I got my side of hash browns and they were just a small square of what looked to be previously frozen. They were hardly crispy and the inside was cold. My omelette was so greasy I couldn't even eat it. My daughter got sprinkle pancakes which were okay, nothing more than average. The worst part about the meal was everything had black crunchies in it, as if they reused the same pan for everything. I'm assuming it was left over burnt food from a previous order. At least that's what I'm praying it was... After the meal we hardly ate, we waited a solid 15 minutes just to pay.  Honestly I do not understand why so many people talk about IHOP. Dennys is far better and you get way more for your buck. Maybe it was just this location that is terrible. I will never return.",

    "text": "The service and food was excellent. My wife, myself, and 2 children were seated within 5 minutes on a Thursday night. The server came and got us drinks, took our orders very quickly. The food was delicious. Kids eat free weeknights and they really enjoyed their meals.  The cons: the menus were sticky. The kids high chairs were dirty and one had a missing buckle. The diaper changing station in the mens room is broken and the changing platform is not level, it tilts downward.  All in all I was satisfied at the very least I believe our dining experience was superior to eat'n'park.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to this IHOP - and it's going to be my last.   I mean, IHOP has never been my favorite place to eat, but it's never been truly horrible, at least in the San Francisco area, but this was my first Pgh. area experience, and I am reminded of why I generally have always preferred to eat almost anywhere else, only on steroids.   Where to start?  After visiting a couple of sick friends at nearby Charles Morris this evening, I was starving, and deeply craving a salad. A quick Google search showed a beautiful Cobb salad on the menu, and for a good bit less money than my current local favorite Shady Grove (and minus the bar scene noise and hassle), so off I went.   The place was deserted. One waitress, and at most two tables in use. So far, so good. It also appeared to be spotlessly clean- another big plus, obviously- although the Pergo/vinyl floor and dim, bluish lighting made it feel quite cold and not very welcoming.   The waitress tries to stick me at a table just in front of and across the aisle from the serving station, which had what looked like a pail of bleach sitting right in view, so I said I didn't want to sit right by the station. She tries to seat me a couple of tables away - equally close to the station but on the other side of it, cleaning pail still fully in view. I end up at a table in the far side of the restaurant at the very back, which was OK, although a bit of a hike.   I order my salad, and the first clue that all would not be well surfaced when I learned that they don't have vinegar and oil, and that avocado is a whopping $0.90 extra. Well, OK, it's not a Cobb salad without avocado, and I love the stuff unreasonably, so fine.   Food and decaf ordered, I head to the rest room.   O. M. G., what a mess! Four stalls, and not a single one usable, *including* the handicapped one, which I need because of, well, walking issues, plus a large service dog. (Did I mention she stuck me at the very back of the restaurant, as far from the restroom as possible? Despite using a cane and said large dog?)  Exiting to get someone to clean the place up, I am greeted by the sight of a group of something like 20 people just arrived.    It took forever, and at least 3 requests, including an actual threat to pee right there on the floor in the entry to get someone to clean it up at all. It had to be a good 15-20 minutes total before the server finally took a super quick swipe at it and I was able to use it. Standing only, though.   Outside the restroom, the party of 20 church group has been seated, and both waitrons were buzzing busily around them. And the other two patrons who had also come in after I did.   I get back to my table, expecting to be able to sit down and at the minimum start my coffee - and even the water isn't there yet.   The water and coffee show up, finally, and then my onion rings. The coffee and onion rings are both only lukewarm. The onion rings were at least warm enough to still be crisp, and were very tasty, but it was still disappointing.   The salad shows up. Oy gevalt, such a sorry looking thing! Limp greens, a mere sliver of avocado, the whole thing only barely covering the bottom of the bowl - nothing at all like the robust picture on the menu. At least it wasn't iceberg, but there was less than a cupful of greens.   They were out of blue cheese \"crumbles\", and I was offered parmesan cheese (or croutons) instead. I declined. Blech.   The bacon was limp and almost stone cold, only warm enough to let me know it had just been cooked, but was at least edible - which is a lot more than I can say for the chicken. Vile, disgusting- and clearly made of rubber. My dog went nuts for the smell of it, of course - but it was so gross I didn't even want to give it to him.   So now the \"Cobb\" salad that actually wasn't has lost absolutely *all* resemblance to what a Cobb salad actually should be. There wasn't even an egg. Way, way overpriced for what it was.   I think the salad dressing was actually rancid. It was certainly the worst \"ranch\" dressing I've ever had, so I ate the salad (such as it was) completely bone dry. The party of 20+ was in full swing; there was clearly no way I was ever going to be able to get anything else this side of next weekend. The one ten days from now.   Not that I was able to find even that out in a timely fashion, because the fork they gave me was filthy. So was the second one I was finally able to obtain after asking three different times. I did finally get a clean one.    Needless to say, no one ever checked in to ask me how things were after serving me.   I asked to have the charge for the avocado deleted when I went to pay, and at least the waitress was willing to do that.   This all went down several hours ago now, and my stomach is still churning in revolt. I'm hoping this will be the end of it.",

We waited around an hour to get our food because they are understaffed literally there was one waitress and a cook that's us and they had decent amount of customers. Very unhappy with the location and the management. Although the place is clean",
