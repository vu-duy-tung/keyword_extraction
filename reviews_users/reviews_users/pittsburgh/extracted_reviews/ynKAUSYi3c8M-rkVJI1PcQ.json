I delivered products there for a few years, and would see them starting to cook their pizza sauce at 6am or so.  Very flavorful and fresh, definitely not from a can.    I've tried a few other things on the menu.  It's good food, but really too expensive and nothing compares to their plain old cheese pie.",

    "text": "Many people complain about the food here, but I've had nothing but good experiences. Their pizza is okay: good sauce, but nothing special. However, their wedding soup is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It's simple, brothy, with perfect meatballs. Not too many restaurants seem to serve wedding soup, and if they do it's often over salted. Dipietros makes the best wedding soup I've ever had. I dream about it on cold rainy days in Boston. Additionally, their fried zucchini is pretty great. Add a little lemon juice to it, and you'll never regret ordering it. I will say, I've never ordered anything besides those three items. But when they are so perfect, why try anything else?",

The salads were decent with lettuce, a tomato, two olives and 2 pieces of onion on each and came with a small side of balsamic dressing.  For my entree I decided on having the Penne DiPietro which was sausage, chicken and Gorgonzola cheese in a tomato cream sauce while my dining companion had the Chicken Romano.  I was impressed with the sauce on mine, especially whenever it was infused with a bit of Gorgonzola, and the sausage was decent enough but the chicken had a very firm taste, almost like it was dry after had been left out for a very long time.  It was definitely not cooked freshly.  My dining companions chicken was moist and tasted much better with the cheese and eggplant that was on top of it tasting decent as well.  However she did not enjoy the pasta that came with it.  The bottom line for me is that I will not be coming back here anytime in the near future.  The food was decent at best and with the $45 with tip that it cost us to eat here, sans appetizer, dessert and a drink other than water, I can easily find numerous better restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.",

Sorry mom.  And I guess its about the same with DiPietro's....if you've never had good Italian, you might think theirs is pretty good.  Nope.    Specifics.  I had chicken parm.  The chicken was dry and chewy.  The side salad was one of those glass plates with a few pieces of  iceberg, a leaf or two of spring greens - just enough to keep it from being ALL iceberg, the requisite cherry tomato, rings of red onion - does everyone just move those off to the side of the plate?  And the house Italian dressing?  I swear it was Good Seasons from the shaker bottle.  Housemade dressing doesn't have those tiny specks of red and black and God knows what else floating around in it.    The price for this 2 small pieces of nearly inedible chicken in a smear of sauce and a sprinkle of mozz, a wholly inadequate salad and a small pile of watery veggies?  $18.  Really.    If you want Italian, this isn't it.  You'd be better off with Olive Garden.",

    "text": "So I don't even want to write a review on this place because I want to keep it my little secret.  My husband and I went here one day on a whim and now it is one of our staples.  This might be my favorite restaurant in the North Hills.    It doesn't look like much on the outside and certainly doesn't offer fine dining inside.  The entrance is the take out order place and then you go into the cozy restaurant to be seated.  The waitresses offer friendly service.  Always ask for the bread and oil at the beginning of the meal.  They only bring it to regulars or those that ask.  We always order the Penne DiPietro which is a vodka sauce penne with sausage and chicken.  My mouth is watering as I sit and think about it.  We usually always get canolli's (spelling?) for desert which comes with 2 of them for sharing.  I will say that the service is impecable but the meals are usually long.  The waitresses are well trained not to bring all your food at once and don't rush you out of there.  They make it an eating event which we love.  I should also say that they take the entertainment and enjoy cards and never punch them.  They do this on purpose so you can use them over and over again.  This in itself causes me to purchase the entertainment card every year.  I totally reccomend this place to everyone.",

The meat sauce was minimally ladled over the top was amazing, but needed added to the construction of the lasagne. Save yourself the trouble and ignore the award notification, and order the stuffed shells or similar pasta stuffed with ricotta, to avoid the total dryness of the lasagne.(which was a huge disappointment after seeing friends reviews of this place, and the award winning lasagne). Sad to say, but stouffers lasagne its better(they understand to put sauce(which is way worse) between layers, but they know how to construct it! From what little sauce I received, it was excellent.

This is the original and one of those \"undiscovered\" local gems you can't get enough of.  The small pizza and hoagie shop has a few booths to grab a quick bite or to get your order to go, and also serves as the waiting area for the fine dining expansion towards the back.  Expect decent if not large portions of True italian cuisine.  My favorite dishes are the Chicken Veronelle (sauteed chicken breast & jumbo shrimp served with a white wine and lemon butter sauce) and the Fettuccine Carbonara.  Their homemade hot sausage will surely make your brow sweat and your mouth happy.  Their prices are reasonable for a fine dining establishment, yet somehow when I have the same entree's delivered to the house and dine in my PJ's while watching TV I find myself thinking the bill seems high.  *sigh* If only they could deliver their ambiance too.",

The entrance to DiPietro's is for ordering pizza and subs - the restaurant is in the rear and is cozy and quaint. We were promptly seated and our waitress was spot-on and quick.   My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan - which he does at every Italian restaurant - and got 2 large pieces of chicken with a side of penne. I ordered the ricotta stuffed shells. The sauce is smooth with a hint of sweetness. It's not overly cooked, so you can still taste the freshness of the tomatoes and basil. The shells were stuffed with a combination of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses and the filling was slightly creamy and not too dry. It bugs me when cheese filling is dry and grainy.  The prices seemed a bit on the high end for pasta in a small neighborhood. The chicken parm was $18 and my stuffed shells were $16...although, soup or salad is included.   I'd say that DiPietro's is a place that we'd visit again.",

The service was friendly and the food was good to great and the restaurant itself clean with many windows to let that Pittsburgh sunshine in.  I ordered the fried zucchini as a appetizer.  It was a tad over crunchy and the zucchini was on the thin side.  The marinara served with it was amazing.  If this same sauce is used with their pasta, it's already a winner!  I also ordered the half steak hoagie.  It comes with onion, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  I ordered it without the mayo and the waitress asked if I wanted ketchup (we are in Heinz country!) or Italian dressing.  It was nice to be presented with options. The hoagie was the best that I've had in awhile.  The bread was lightly toasted but fresh.  The steak was tender and had great flavor.  I will definitely visit Di Pietro's again on my next visit to Pittsburgh.",

It's a nice little Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed with the Italian music in the background and decorations giving you that old, classic Italian restaurant feel when you dine there. It's never been too busy when we stop by around 5:30. I don't think we have ever waited for a table. I usually order their spicy pepper pasta (I think it may be called pasta diablo or something along those lines). It's pretty good although a hit or miss whether it's really spicy or not that night; I like it very spicy. That flavor is very good with the banana peppers in the marinara sauce. I've heard their pizza is pretty good but we've never actually tried it for whatever reason. I've also ordered the chicken marsala before and that was pretty tasty. I'd recommend the restaurant to anyone. The food is pretty average and costly so I'm just giving it 4 stars.",

The stuffed shells are excellent with exceptionally flavorful cheese. The pizza is as good as any NY or Chicago pizza I've had (and I've had more than my share).  The veal parm is great and the zucchini appetizer is a \"specialty\" not to be missed. I'll be back in town this fall, and I'm already looking forward to it.",

When I want a good, home-cooked Italian dinner, there is no where else to go. Their menu has a nice variety from the basic spaghetti and meatballs (the meatballs are wonderful) to my favorite, Veal Romano. Fork tender breaded veal medallions in their signature marinara sauce, covered with eggplant with just the right amount of parmigiana cheese. Throw in a house salad, a bowl of wedding soup and the always present Mancini's bread and butter and I'm in heaven! The stuffed banana peppers or provolone saltimboco are also delicious appetizers. You have got to try the Steak Diavolo or the Fettuccine Carbonara (fair warning, the order is enough for two meals!) Those of you who have lived in the North Hills for the last 30 years probably already know of this gem, but for those that don't, please give DiPietro's a try. The service is great, no rush. It's a great place to have a bottle of red wine, great food, and reeeeeelax.",

    "text": "If you haven't visited or eaten in Pittsburgh, you should if you're ever going through the general area.  On this brief day of passing through, I only ate at Jimmy John's downtown, just inboard from the city's Point State Park with the fountain next to the three rivers, and here, at DiPietro's.  DiPietro's is the real deal - in its food and in its ownership and roots.  It is both a restaurant and a pizzeria.  When you enter, the pizzeria is at your right.  If you're destined for the restaurant, it's straight ahead.  I did not take photos.  Usually, I don't take photos when I don't like a place or something went askew.  At DiPietro's, it was a combination of just plain forgetting to do so, being too involved in my food, and having a brief chat with both the very pleasant server and the affable proprietor.  I was looking at the menu on-line and trying to figure out what I ordered.  It was a pasta dish.  There were 4 with \"medallions\" indicating that they are either very popular or a house specialty.  I'm not crazy about pastas with the diavolo preparation and, with another item having potentially spicy arrabiata sauce, that ruled that one out, too.  Thus, it was either the lasagne or the penne DiPietro that I ordered.  My entree was delicious and True to form in its preparation.  Kudos to this outfit for its fair prices and including either soup or a salad and Italian bread with the entree platters of pasta.  As far as the logistics go, getting to this enclave of the city makes for neat little trek.  First, to go on the cheap in this metro area, you want to avoid the Pennsylvania Turnpike and that \"cash-less\" tolled spur of I-376 north of the airport.  However, I-79/279 are free of charge ... and DiPietro's is near an exit off of this interstate!  Once off the interstate, you meander down some curves into a hamlet sitting in a little valley and, even though there is a Dunkin Donuts (fine with me) nearby, it's a really quaint little area with some angled parking for the small merchants here.  (This little vale hearkens to an eastern version of L.A.'s bucolic Topanga Canyon which, while once a haven for hippies, was and is sort of nifty for being so close to L.A.)  Ditto for this area in the North Hills of Pittsburgh.  Also, as you descend toward the city on the interstate, you will be going through the city's North Hills and actually be above the fairly tall skyscrapers downtown.  Now that's cool.    The thought of coming back to this tasty restaurant if ever in Pittsburgh again is cool, too.  I was daydreaming about their pizza as I walked out but didn't have any room in the hatch after eating dinner and it didn't seem like a \"slice\" sort of place.  DiPietro's pulls in a solid 4 stars from me.",

    "text": "My wife and I dropped by here for dinner on a Thursday night. We found Dipietros in the enjoy coupon book and decided to give it a try. Upon arriving at the restaurant I noticed a sign outside celebrating 40 years in West View. Very cool!   My wife and I were seated fairly quickly upon arriving. The inside had the feel and decoration of an Italian restaurant. The decoration seemed a bit dated and the layout was a little odd. There were two levels with the lower level having tables fairly close together and the upper level having all the lights turned off. On the lower level I could pretty much hear everyone's conversation so don't come here hoping for any privacy.   I ended up ordering the pasta diavolo. It is a spicy dish with sausage and peppers. Our order came with soup or salad. Both my wife and ordered the salad with house made Italian dressing. The salad was nothing fancy with just some onion, tomato, and olives. An Ok salad with good dressing. The pasta was decent as well. It had a good heat level and the sausage was the star of the dish.   I think the pasta here is solid and just the right amount for dinner, but the restaurant is a little outdated and I wouldn't consider the bathroom clean when I used it. The prices here indicate a fancier restaurant, but I wouldn't consider price to be on par with the rest. I may be back here but this isn't on the top of my list of places to come to.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to use our Enjoy Book coupon and give DiPietro's a try. There was ample parking nearby, with just a short walk to the restaurant. The front of the building reminded me of an old \"family owned\" styled restaurant with a large canopy across the length of the restaurant and the name printed on the canopy.   We were greeted by the hostess and seated right away. Again, the set up and style took me back to any family owned restaurant I have been to in the past. Wooden furniture, white tablecloths, booths lining the perimeter, and large pictures hanging on the walls. The aroma of pizza and hearty Italian food immediately permeated my senses! It smelled wonderful.   The menu was large, with quite a variety of Italian dishes, from casual to more formal. Chicken, Seafood, Veal, and Steak to Pasta, Pizza, Sandwiches, Salads, and Calzones. I was craving pasta but was looking for a lighter option and sure enough, it was there! I ordered the Linguine Antonietta, a linguine based dish with roasted broccoli, zucchini, onions, carrots, and mushrooms with an oil based coating. I really enjoyed it however would have loved the addition of more vegetables (with a little less pasta) and some grilled chicken for protein! All dinners were served with a choice of soup, side salad, or vegetable and Italian bread. The side salad was basic with tomatoes, black olives and white onions on a bed of lettuce. I ordered their homemade Italian dressing and it was pretty tasty. The bread could have been much warmer and the butter was really cold, making it hard to spread.  The price of the dinners were mostly between $15-$20 which seemed to me to be on the higher side. However, there was some value as you get the soup/salad option before your meal and a loaf of bread to share among the table. Our waitress was very nice and helpful when we had questions about the menu and was very quick to fill our waters.   We had a solid experience here. A restaurant with a nice, homey feel, nice staff, decent food, slightly overpriced.",

    "text": "This is one of our local Friday after work pasta and wine chill spots. It's pretty reliable in terms of quality of service and food and we find ourselves there at least once a month.  We ended up there this past Friday and it was really crowded.  I guess a lot of folks were craving good pasta and pizza on a subzero February night.    We tend to stick to ordering the same things because we really like them but last night I tried something new. Personally, I love their pasta dish, Linguine Diavolo which has homemade sausage and peppers and onions tossed with marinara.  So darned good!  Their Shrimp Scampi over Linguine is pretty darned good too if I'm in the mood for a lot of butter.  But tonight, I wanted something lighter so I tried their Chicken Piccata.    The dish is served with your choice of soup or salad and a side of pasta or veggie.  I love their homemade Italian dressing so I always get their salad and sop up the remaining dressing on my plate with the fresh Mancini's Italian bread they serve.  I ordered the side of pasta and substituted angel hair for the penne.  The price is around $17 which is not bad when you get bread, soup/salad and a side of pasta or vegetable. I'm not sure what people expect when they say they think DiPietro's is expensive - maybe they mean their pizza which can be a little on the pricier side.    The Piccata is served with fresh thick cut mushrooms and thin pounded chicken breasts with a delicate lemon wine sauce.  It was really delicious and could easily be two meals.  Yeah, maybe next time I'll save half.  The angel hair with marinara was perfectly sauced and tender and I found myself finishing off the last sauce with that addictive Mancini's bread.  Isn't it terrible?  Dipping bread into Italian dressing and marinara for dessert?  Since we had a friend with us, we ordered up a full carafe of the Bellagio Chianti to share and I must say, that is a nice amount of wine for the price - $31.99.  It's a full litre of wine and we ended up taking some home for a nice night cap.",

Our waitress also brought us out a bunch of Italian bread & butter to start with.   I ordered the meatball casserole (served over a large portion of penne pasta), which comes with a side salad or soup.    I chose the salad with house dressing.  The salad was a simple salad mix with some black olives and a few red onions.  Many times the house dressing can be the best part of a restaurant, but this one was just not my taste. It was a sweet Italian dressing that lacked spices.  But it was okay enough to finish my salad after I had already dumped it on.    The 6 meatballs served in the casserole were very flavorful and about the size of a golf ball, the spaghetti sauce was good but could also use a little more flavor.  It was topped with a healthy amount of melted mozzarella cheese which was so good. The portion of the casserole was very large and I took about half of it home with me!  They also had a large selection of Italian desserts like cannoli, tiramisu, cheesecake, Spumoni ice cream, and some others, but I was too full to partake!   I would definitely come back to this restaurant for a casual, Italian meal with great customer service!",

    "text": "It makes me sad that I have to give DiPietro's only 3 stars, but I'll explain why.   I'm not from the area where this restaurant is located and when my boyfriend wanted to come here for his birthday a little over a year ago, I really enjoyed this place. Very classy with the white table cloths and Italian decor, also the classy music. I'm one of those people that will order the same entree every time I go out. And nothing turns me on more than getting some homemade fettuccine Alfredo from an Italian restaurant. The first time I had Alfredo from DiPietro's, it was absolutely fantastic. So cheesy and definitely homemade.   Unfortunately, my boyfriend went on a date night last night here, and I, of course, ordered the Alfredo, and I was completely disappointed. I could 100% tell that the Alfredo sauce was a pre-made powder sauce. You know, those packets of powder you can buy at the store to make quick Alfredo? That is definitely what it was. I've had more Alfredo than the average person and I'm pretty much an expert when it comes to perfecting it, and it was just awful. Pasta was not home made, and this fake sauce was drenching the pasta. The ratio was way off. Didn't have a cheesy or garlic flavor too it like previous times. And it just looked artificial. No butter, and no fresh grated Parmesan like before.   I've eaten here probably 4 or 5 times in my life and I've never been dissatisfied with the Alfredo until last night. Next time I'll have to order something different to get a decent idea of how all their food tastes. My boyfriend always orders the pizza and loves it however. He loves those big Sicilian pizzas, extra cheese and jalapenos every time. Last night he got a calzone, which he liked but said it was a bit doughy in the center. The sauce he ordered with it however was very nice. That was homemade for sure, which gives me hopes about this place.   I love Italian cuisine and it breaks my heart to see this restaurant start to head down hill. I definitely see room for improvement. Our waitress was extremely nice but took forever to check on our tables for refills and to take away dirty plates. It was exceptionally stressing because we were the only ones dining in.   And this may be odd but with how beautiful the restaurant is styled it was strange to me to see red pepper flakes on each table in those little McCormick spice containers. Seems to throw off how classy the place is.   Overall I give this place a 3. I really hope they improve their food and staff to get this place on track again, sitting in an empty restaurant at 8 at night on a Sunday breaks my heart inside. I keep hearing rumors around town that this place might close sometime soon and I'd hate to see that happen.",

Dressing for the starter salad came on the side in a disposable plastic cup. Cheap and wasteful. Pasta entrees were huge. Bread was thick and bland. For $17 - $35 for an entree, I would rather have higher quality food in normal portions I don't have to take home. But for a neighborhood spot like this, it would make more sense to serve smaller portions of the same decent quality food at a lower price point. Wine list was all bargain brands or less expensive house brands. Did not try any.   My main complaint about this place is the service. Our entrees came out about two minutes after we got our appetizers. So the waitress just left them on our table \"so they wouldn't get cold in the back\" and we struggled to eat with a bunch of plates cluttering the table. I guess once the kitchen screwed up by timing the meal wrong, she did the right thing in letting us choose which we wanted to get cold - appetizer or main course. But we shouldn't have had to make that choice. Afterward she continued to leave empty plates on our crowded table. Also we requested no straws and were served water with straws already in it.",

I got the fettuccini carbonara, and there was waaaayy too much salt in the mix. The idea is there but there's just way too much salt to make it good. It came with a side salad and bread. Those were good.   The waitress couldn't really make any suggestions on dinner options. She said everyone's getting the lasagna, I guess. Ooohhhkayyy?   I heard pizza is good here, but I may not go back.   Back to the dating game.   Happy Eating!",

    "text": "One of my coworkers wanted to go back to the \"neighborhood \" for pizza and wings.  When we walked in I thought, oh boy this isn't going to be cheap\"!!  It's more like an Italian restaurant than it is a pizza parlor. But let me tell you something ---  it was fabulous!  The wings were crispy and so saucy --- the way I like them!  The pizza (and I saw it on a lot of the tables as we walked through the restaurant) was so so so good!  The sausage was definitely the star ingredient---I am guessing they may make their own!  The coworker had a nice long conversation with the owner (in Italian of course)!  They had a banner on the outside that said they were celebrating 42 years in the neighborhood!!  Well, I grew up or never lived anywhere this neighborhood-but this place is definitely a gem in the great city of Pittsburgh!  Although the night was miserable and cold weather wise - the atmosphere inside is what I would imagine any Italian restaurant being like in the days of Capone!!!  I hope to visit again soon!  Give them a try -many other things on the menu.... or just go with the pie...it's Amore!!!!",

The food wasn't that great. Didn't care for the banana peppers. I got a side Caesar salad with my dinner  and the upcharge for a tiny salad with dressing on the side was $3. The salad wasn't worth $3 let alone an upcharge. My wife liked her seafood and vegetables special. I had spaghetti with meat sauce and a meatball which was not a very good pasta. Thin sauce with little meat and no taste. Was expecting more and probably will not return.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place. I really did. It sounded like a place I would enjoy being older Italian restaurant that I figured had pretty good food based mainly on the area, how it looked and how I perceived it.   I was wrong. We had dinner last night at DiPietro's, a party of three. The restaurant is basically a pizza parlor up front and a sit down restaurant in back. We ordered a sausage roll and split it between three of us which was very good. I liked the dough, their sauce and the sausage roll itself.   I ordered the chicken parmesan which is a staple in Italian American restaurants. Usually, like pizza even when it's bad it's pretty good. Not in this case. The chicken was pounded so thin and was so over cooked and rubbery it was a shame. The breading was dark brown, bordering on burnt. Sauce was fine on it, but it could've used more. Pasta side dish was over cooked. Pretty bummed out about this.   The other orders at the table were Chicken Picatta and Manicotti. The server was asked if Chicken Piccata could be made as it was not on the menu, but they had Veal Picatta. They were able to accommodate the order. Again, two of the thinnest pieces of chicken I've ever seen and they appeared to be over cooked. The sauce broke very quickly as well. If the chicken wasn't pounded to 1/4\" in thickness, both it and the chicken parmesan would have been better. Stop trying to save money by pounding the chicken to death. You're ruining the product! You're charging $17.99 for chicken parmesan and it flat out isn't good!  As for the Manicotti I didn't have it but our guest did. To me it personally looked dry. I don't care for manicotti, but it didn't look great.   I probably wouldn't go back to DiPietro's.   DiPietro's reminds me of a place that was started by a family from the greatest generation and was fantastic for many years, but when the children took over it declined and everything became an after thought. While I know it's not that's the vibe I got from it.",
