I had a peppered fillet that was somewhat decent with exception of being cooked medium instead of medium-rare like I asked.    The decor brings a on wave of 80's nostalgia. The dining room lights are off in the evening, I suppose so that the view of the food does not distract you from the view of the city.",

The cocktail I ordered looked promising on paper although I was a little hesitant because it included banana liquor, but I gambled that the toasted marshmallow would prevail. It did not. The beverage started off promising with the toasted marshmallow, but quickly went south when the banana liquor kicked in. IT did not receive positive review from our table either. The drink proceeded to sit in front of me and mixed with melting ice started to look like a type of bodily fluid, which I won't name.  As for the view, you couldn't get a better one on Mount Washington overlooking the Pittsburgh skyline. With both an indoor bar and a terrace, we were able to move inside once the cold got the best of us.",

    "text": "This is a great, no a grand location on grandview ave.  The view is amazing and it has one of the best decks in Mt. Washington and plenty of outdoor seating.  It is a must visit in the summer when you can view the beautiful Pittsburgh vista in all its wonder.  I've been coming here for almost a decade and while I give the place much deserved kudos for a fantastic location and wonderful deck the food is another story.  I guess it's best to start with a little background the current incarnation is the \"coal hill steakhouse\" at the Grandview Saloon.  Most regulars still refer to the place as the Grandview for obvious reasons.  In all the years I've been a patron I don't think I've ever had dinner in one of the dining rooms.  The entrance has two sets of stairs, one leading downstairs to the bar and wonderful deck and the other two leading to two dining rooms upstairs.  The carpeting and general decor of the dining rooms is dated and the food used to be, well in a word... awful.  It's a little better now, but not close to what I would consider good food.  The owner is a surgeon who clearly uses this venue for tax purposes probably without a lot of consideration given necessarily to the quality of the product.  Again, the view is great from all areas of the restaurant and this place does most of its business in the summer when folks appreciate the outdoor seating more.  The food has improved lately in its most recent incarnation as a \"steakhouse\".  Let me back up,,, besides kudos for the view the staff is very corteous and friendly.  I had lunch here today and was the only visitor to the bar for the couple hours I was there and had a good conversation with Rose who was working a very tame sunday shift.  Charlie and Dana are also excellent bartenders.  The bar seats about 15 with plenty of hightops and again lots of outdoor deck seating for the summer.  It has three huge plasmas with plenty of sporting options.  They maintain a decent wine menu and have plenty of beer options, including guiness on tap.  Charlie and Dana also make a reasonably good dirty martini.  If you are looking for a place that is not crowded on a Sunday to watch football you could do a lot worse.  Okay, now to the food.  I've ate here multiple times and never really had a good meal.  The steak prices are unreasonable I believe for the quality of the product and it's not possible to get a steak less than 14 oz. and $40 plus dollars unless you orderr a filet.  They offer the filet in a 6 oz. and 10 oz. option.  I still think the $30 plus pricetag is a bit much for the 6 oz. filet.  I think they say it's prime, but in my experience the steaks don't stack up to those of mortons or ruths.  Today I ordered a cup of french onion soup, which was probably the highlight of the meal with a nice crouton, tasty broth, and plenty of melted guyerre (sp?) cheese.  I then ordered a cheesesteak sandwich and asparagus instead of fries.  The cheesesteak was a huge serving, but of relatively flavorless meat underseasoned on a stale non toasted bun.  The asparagus were tiny and had way too much salt.  If this place puts itself out as a prime steakhouse the asparagus should be much better and the steak should have some flavor.  They also charge an additional $3 for veggies instead of fries on top of the cost of the sandwich platter.  The view is 5 stars, service 4 stars and food 2 stars.",

    "text": "My experience started when I called for reservations for my wife's birthday. I called and I asked for reservations in the afternoon a few days before going. They took my name and number and said they'd have to check and call me back in an hour. I thought that was strange. After three hours, no call back. My wife meanwhile called and made reservations because that's what she wanted to do on her birthday. I called again and they said no problem. I asked about a window seat. Had to put $25 down to guarantee a window seat at our scheduled time of 6:30 PM. The fee gets refunded off your bill. It is to guarantee you come so I could understand I guess, views are limited.  We arrived and were promptly seated. The waiter was attentive and polite. I thought \"hmmm, good, maybe the bad reviews were full of it after all\" after reading reviews and checking here on Yelp and Google. We each received a soda beverage since we don't drink (I was driving, she doesn't drink). The soda was good, not watered down or funny tasting like some carbonated taps are. We both ordered Delmonico Steaks and salads as side orders. The salads came and were fine. Then our meals come pretty quickly. Great service! I thought. Then the bottom of the bucket fell out.  Her steak was done right, ordered medium well. Mine was ordered medium rare and was well. I can't eat a steak at a \"steakhouse\" that costs almost $40 as well done. I complained and they promptly re-fired me another. That one came out in a few minutes and was blue all through - rare. Sent back for a few minutes. Came back and although better was still more rare then medium rare but whatever, I'd rather it be more rare then cooked. The steak by now was pretty much ruined with vital juice gone and being a little tough. This was a $39 steak. unacceptable. I also ordered \"red skinned roasted potatoes\". I ended up with what I call \"Idaho fried burnt potatoes\" which were chopped up idaho potato that was fried or roasted to a crisp.  My main focus is on the steaks we ordered. Besides the atmosphere and decor not being very pleasant nor romantic - cafeteria style tables and chairs, crowded, not very pleasant - the steaks were plain bad. How dare they call themselves a \"steakhouse\". It is known and signed as Grandview Saloon and Coal Steakhouse. They couldn't cook a steak to save their life. The steak was half fat (I know Delmonicos have marbling but not this bad) and not charred. A \"real\" steakhouse normally puts a nice char on the outside. They did slap some kind of glaze sauce and garlic butter on it, which wasn't bad. Half the steak came home for the dog.   So in summary, we treated this place as a steakhouse in which it is billed as. This could be farther from the truth. My steak wasn't cooked right twice. The decor is something out of a cafeteria. The view was stunning. Maybe if we kept \"cheap\" and ordered a sandwich instead it would have been better. This was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner with a romantic view of the city and turned out to be a dud. It was a $125 view. I left there still hungry. Although I would try a sandwich or something else instead I would not go back. Too many other good choices. As for the steak dinner, I'd go to Texas Roadhouse or Lone Star for a much better experience. The steaks are actually tastier there. One last thing, our waiter didn't even to offer a comp for the lousy steak. My bad for not pushing it. I just wanted to get the hell out of there and not ruin my wife's birthday any further.  Two stars for the view , salads were edible and soda was good. The waiter was attentive and polite. Other than that, save your money. As another reviewer stated called it: \"A tourist trap\". Shame on us.",

    "text": "Don't ever try their Strips! and the service is worse than the food.  The half of the tiny piece of the steak was fat and overcooked. we got a fish and a New York Strip but this strip was just horrible. They tend to have overcook your steak generally so when we asked for a medium rare, it wasn't a surprise to see a well done steak. But the portion didn't even seem like it was 12 oz (much smaller) and the fat was just grossly too much. So we told our waiter that we were very disappointing and we dont want this dish anymore but he just kept making excuses that it is because of the way its cut and that much of fat is normal so he can't refund nor make a new steak since we already had some. He ended up taking 10 dollars off for 2 beers but that was it. Not even for my drinks, just my boyfriend's since the strip was his food. No apologies, no attempt to make up for it, nothing. Their filet mignon and tuna steak are what we usually get but it was just a terrible mistake to try something new; ended up seeing their worst customer service. Never will I ever go back here nor take anyone especially when there are so many restaurants with higher quality of food and much better service for the same price (or less).",

But you leave with an overwhelming sensation of having your wallet taken for a ride.    It took an hour from the time we sat down until our entrees appeared.  And this was at lunchtime on a Saturday.  The place was hardly slammed.  When it arrived, my \"Killer Crab\" sandwich was fair, but hardly anything I'd go running back for.  The few lonely french fries on the plate didn't do much to help.    The name of the place, too, is highly deceiving.  You think \"steakhouse\" with elegant, dark wood decor.  You actually get a space that hasn't seen much in upgrades in decades.    The cocktails, too, were as watery as the thing they call \"iced tea,\" which bore more of a resemblance to brown-tinted water than anything I've ever tasted that involved real tea leaves.    The quality of Mount Washington dining has been going up in the past few years.  This place certainly bucks that trend, serving low-rent food at top-dollar prices.",

Pitt Tunnel at night, the incline, etc., as they have never been.    When we got to Mt. Washington, we weren't sure where to eat, but wandered into the Coal Hill Steakhouse.  Although they were out of chicken and the dessert menu was practically non-existent on 12/23/12 (we were told they were closed the next two nights, and therefore, ran out of many items) we all managed to place our orders and hoped for the best.  My son and I had the Grandview Prime Steak Sandwich and fries.  My son and I both agree that was the best steak we have ever eaten in our lives - it was to die for. The fries were cold, which I didn't like, but my son said he loved the fries and didn't care that they weren't hot.  My husband had the Coal Hill Reuben, and deemed it the best he's ever had.  My daughter had the Coal Hill Alfredo, that she absolutely loved, but couldn't eat it all.  No worries, my hubby finished it off and he agreed it was very good.  Although we couldn't get dessert, and the fries were cold, the other food more than made up for these shortcomings.  I am still in shock, and cannot believe how inexpensive the meal was when all was said and done.  With all this said, I feel a little embarrassed to mention this, but it did seem rather strange that a steakhouse uses paper napkins, but then again, it could just be me.  I've never been to a steakhouse that didn't use real linen napkins.  I would have given the Coal Hill Steakhouse five stars, but with the cold fries, limited menu and desserts, and those horrible paper napkins, I think four stars is appropriate.  We'll be back the next time we're in town!",

We were a party of five, with a mix of entrees, but none of them stood out - and not worth whatever the bill may have come to at the end of the night. We had great company, and that made it bearable. I can't actually no recommend this enough.",

So we wandered down the stairs to the restaurant/bar, to see no bartender behind the bar, one person at the bar, and one person outside bussing a table. When we asked if we could have a drink she told us \"well...the bartender's...umm...\" (looking at the bar with no bartender behind it) \"uh...the kitchen is closing soon...\" So we just took a few photos and left.

It's not just this joint, it's all the Grandview Avenue restaurants. The View masks the poor food quality, the over inflated drink prices, and mediocre service. Just look out at the view and you'll forget about the frozen chicken tenders, rubbery and over salted, the watery drinks are much better when you're watching fireworks near PNC Park after a Bucco home run and victory.  Do yourself a huge favor and give up the view, head on over to the Shiloh Inn, sit out on the deck (Weather Permitting) or grab a seat in this old house, refurbished into a quaint eatery and chow down on some excellent pub food and let the tourists have the view, besides we've all seen it before, right?",

We opted to eat here since the menu seemed to cater to everyone in our group. The prices were inflated but that was expected because of the locale. We expressed to the wait staff that we'd like to wait for a table out on the patio and they were able to seat us within minutes. The staff and service was pretty good when we were in, so I'm surprised about all the bad service comments.   Everyone enjoyed their dinner, but I do have to note that only one of us ordered steak. The rest of our orders included a burger, fish and pasta. I ordered a seafood pasta dish and was satisfied - yummy, but nothing to write home about, but I will say I was impressed that the size of the shrimp and scallops were big!    All in all it was a lovely evening. Decent food and incredible view with great company!",

They would not seat us and stated that the wait for food would be 1.5 hours and then they would be closed. I then said that we called 15 minutes prior and she stated that we could come in. We were willing to sit on the porch and wait as long as it took for the food to come out... we were in NO rush. They said they would not be able to serve us even in 1.5 hours with very minimal patrons in the  restaurant. I would like the owner of the restaurant to know this happened with his/her staff. Very unprofessional. The woman proceeded to tell us that we were not welcomed in the restaurant. \"She didn't need us here.\" We will not be going back either.  This happened on 9.17.19.",

As I already mentioned, we had a large group, so we sat upstairs from the main dining area with a limited menu selection for entrees but full menu choices for appetizers. The view from this floor was limited, but it was not a problem - We enjoyed spectacular vistas while having a quick drink in the bar before our dinner. A note on the bar: It is spacious and outfitted with a few large televisions (if you get bored staring out the windows). During dinner, the service was very attentive, but not obtrusive. The food was great! We ordered a selection of appetizers, including the crab dip, buffalo chicken dip, coconut shrimp, chicken nachos, and pesto caprese. The shrimp were colossal, but the pesto caprese was my favorite! - Very fresh and flavorful. I ordered the twin crab cake dinner, and selected sides of house salad and broccolini. The crab cakes were ultra meaty, and I could only finish one. The house salad was huge! - A nice spring mix with olives, onions, and cucumbers. I also tried the carbonara, which arrived with two generous slabs of luscious pork belly set on top of the already decadent pasta - Sinfully delicious!   Overall, we had a great dining experience at Coal Hill! The exterior is dated and \"divey,\" but I feel like this adds to the charm so don't be put off and pass this gem of a restaurant!",

Mainly for the great view of Pittsburgh, but their food is good and relatively priced for Mt Washington.   I had the steak salad in a what I would call a sink!  No other way to describe it..it was huge! The steak was cooked exactly how I requested and tasted very good. It was a challenge to cut steak in the salad sink though. The rest of the salad was quite yummy too, but by the end of the meal it didn't look like I ate any of it.   Others in our group raved about the coconut shrimp, the wings and large fried fish. Crabs cakes had lots of crab, so that's good. Wedding soup was also a winner.  There were some lunch losers too. So I'd stick with the basics.   They seemed light on servers so we had to wait along time in between drink and food orders.  Luckily we were not in a hurry.",

We started as a party of 6 and grew to a table of 12 with rolling drink and food orders, we were basically a server's nightmare and Danielle didn't miss a beat, and clearly had some good support from her co-workers. She was friendly and attentive and recognized that it was a hot day and never let our drinks get empty. We ordered a variety of dishes and everything was delicious. I would definitely come back here!",

Walked into this place on a Saturday at 11:30 AM to learn that kids under 7 yo are not allowed. This is disturbing on many levels -- kids of any age can behave in different way for whatever reason -- and this is by no means a fine dining restaurant. Happy to take my business elsewhere.",

They always greet you with a smile and remember what you order, True professionals! Added bonus is the incredible view of our beautiful city. The bar and deck is an added gem to Mount Washington. The bar food is delicious (good sandwiches and good wine)!",

When they arrived at this restaurant they were told that children under 7 were not allowed!!  Something is wrong with this!! There  are plenty of adults who act like children,  but are they turned away?  Nope!  Giving this restaurant a big thumbs down! The owners of this place should be ashamed of themselves!  Disgusting!",

View is great, and the deck is an amazing place to have a drink or two on a nice day. Do NOT, however, eat upstairs in the \"steakhouse.\" The ambience is that of your grandmothers kitchen in 1960, the service is abysmal, the food is at best mediocre, and it is WAY ov  It was always a safe bet to get a burger or steak sandwich in the bar. Now... If you are there in the evening they make you order off the overpriced disgusting dinner menu. The prices on that menu how are equivalent to those at Altius or Vue 412, and the food is like eating at Denny's. Stay away.",

    "text": "We chose this restaurant because it was right next door to the incline.  Now what happened to us shouldn't happen at a restaurant that is right next door to a historic landmark like the incline.  After exploring the view from the incline observation deck we decided to get a lunch bite to eat next door.  Upon arriving at the host podium (which is situated right in front of a noisy ktchen door), we were advised that there are no children allowed.  Well, not happy about that but we were ready to move on.  The next thing that happened shows the total lack of compassion or concern for humans in general.  My daughter-in-law was very pregnant and was in great need to use a restroom.  We asked if she might use the restroom before we headed out to find another restaurant and were told no.  Seriously, this just seems like a place that does not deserve anyone's business, no matter what the age.",

Couldn't even finished them. (Mixed drink and glass of wine)The atmosphere was that of a shot and beer place. We didn't stay long and won't go back anytime soon. It just wasn't our scene. It was more of a 20 and 30 something bar crowd. Not sure how the food is. We didn't order anything.",

It was 4:15 on a Wednesday and there were four adults and my daughter with us.  After discussing where we wanted to sit the host asked the age of my daughter and since she is 4 we were not permitted to eat there! They have a policy that only children six and older are permitted to eat there!!! Who has ever heard of such a rule and I can guarantee my four year old behaves as well at a restaurant as a six year old or more.  They lost out on a big sale, big tip and a future customer. I can guarantee I will NEVER be back. After seeing how few stars they have I think we were spared!!!",

Set up a propsal with the wife here a few months back and they helped me the whole way, made a good day of it. Dessert was again delicious caramel cheesecake. I then got some wings which were very tasty. She ordered some pasta and was by no means disappointed. Obviously took the incline up for some nostalgic fun. Figured it worked great right before the Bill Burr show. Cannot wait to come back! Very good people good food nice view. I thought it was lit ok decorated to the liking with modern brushed stainless accents.",
