    "text": "A small place on Craig that always seems to be full of people - you have to walk in single file, between two lines of tables to get to the cash register.   When my bf takes me here (almost once every visit - I love crepes), we usually end up having to make sure one of us grabs a table while the other orders. Upon placing the order, they give you a number, and the server will try to locate you when the food is ready. Kudos to their manuevering abilities.  I've never had much occasion to interact with the servers, so I can't speak much to the service...  ...but the crepes are pretty good. The savory as well as the sweet. I wish I'd get more of the sweet, but I somehow can't bring myself to have crepes for both my meal and my dessert - it adds up, and, no, they're not really inexpensive. To lessen the guilt, I'd have to make sure I get one of the sandwiches for the meal instead - which are also quite good, but, oh, it's so hard to choose when all you're craving is that crepe!",

The side salad was a simply handful of mixed greens with a homemade and quite tasty champagne vinaigrette, and a few slices of tangerines (which should have been fresh but were canned). My mom had the same crepe, we split a soda and had a chocolate pastry, which was also wonderful. Our lunch came in just under $20. I would absolutely go again for another savory crepe, and to try anything with Nutella!",

My favorite of their dishes is the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. All their savory crepes come with a salad, which has clementines and is topped with the most refreshing dressing I've ever had. It's a great place to have lunch or a coffee, but I wouldn't come here if you were in a rush. The service, in my experience, is nice but pretty slow. This, that they're cash only, and the fact that they close very early and stop serving savory crepes an hour before closing are the reasons that I don't come here as often as I might and why it loses a star for me.",

The coffee was a little strong for me but exactly as you would expect and excellent.  The chef is extremely serious about excellence and is there working very hard entire time.

Note #2: Place your order BEFORE taking a seat (y'know, like the sign says), be well-mannered, follow the rules, and you'll most likely have a pleasant time at this pleasant creperie.   Note #3: CP has a fairly broad menu that not only includes savory and dessert crepes, but also sandwiches, salads and other such brunchtime fare.   Indulging in reverse due to The O's lack of desserts, I came to Crepes Parisiennes prior to haunting Phantom of the Attic on a recent, frosty Saturday afternoon and encountered a most extraordinary treat while witnessing no foul tempers.   A coy yet seductive creature of the woods, The Black Forest Crepe has a hide that is thin, wheat-imbibed, and as light and fleeting as a fallen snowflake. Inside, however, is a chocolate pool that is relentlessly dark, immorally, immortally rich, and fit for the damned alone, a group which I myself may be included in. It not only oozed, it glissaded across my plate, advancing, threatening to bring about delectable doom.  A tuft of fresh (!) whipped cream acted as the holy artifact, repelling not only the wickedness of the chocolate but the crimson raspberries and their unstoppable, shockingly brazen tartness. Resembling a dozen demoniac brains, they were gorily spilled onto a point of the accursed, occult, inverted delta itself, adding a fevered fervor to an already malevolent masterpiece.   Quite real, Crepes Parisiennes harbors True evil within shrouds of pan-fried batter. Dismiss the innocuous decor and lovely females (sirens?) and partake only with the utmost courage, purest of spirits...or a death wish...",

    "text": "The food here is really quite good, but your experience will depend a lot on when you come. If you come during peak hours on the weekend, expect a long wait for a table, hurried service, and feeling like you're being rushed to get out of there. However, come during off hours on a weekday and you'll get a relaxing meal in a great atmosphere  I've had both the savory and sweet crepes here, and particularly love the Black Forest one. This is a great place to come with a friend and split two crepes to get a taste for both the savory and sweet ones. The portions are fine for someone my size, but can see them being a little underwhelming for someone with a big appetite.  All in all, a good choice on Craig Street. Just try to avoid it on the weekends",

I was recommended the smoked Icelandic salmon with chives and creme fraiche by the cashier. The crepe had a beautiful thin slice of smoked salmon. The creme fraiche really enhances the dish and gives it a nice kick of salty and sour. The mixed green salad came with a vinaigrette and was topped with mandarin oranges. Nothing special per se, but the oranges really do a disservice to the entire salad. It tasted as if they were bathing in a syrup. Other than that, this establishment was wonderful.  I am looking forward to trying their sweet crepes in the future.",

Little did he know that I was really taking the 4.5 hour flight from San Francisco to have three or four of the best crepes ever created.   As I said before, the Breakfast Crepe is the best. It has egg, cheese, breakfast sausage and your choice of one of a few different sauces (the bechamel is the best). The BF likes his crepes on the sweeter side, so he enjoys the nutella and banana. The savor crepes are served with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet crepes have whipped cream.    Seriously, this place is amazing. If you live in the Pittsburgh, or are visiting you are doing yourself a disservice by not treating yourself to this absolutely fabulous, terrific, superb, and wonderful restaurant. No joke...now that the BF has graduated and no longer lives in Pittsburgh, I have thought about flying over just to eat at Crepes Parisiennes.",

    "text": "All the crepes are a little too simple for my tastes.  I ordered a savory and sweet crepe.  For savory, I ordered the salmon crepe which was supposed to be smoked salmon but did not appear to be so.  Many salmon omelettes I've had before included capers, tomatoes, onions, and cream cheese for a similar price.  The crepe itself was also crispy.  When I order a crepe I expect something a little lighter and softer, so sadly it did not meet my expectation.  Then I ordered the dark chocolate- raspberry crepe.  It has some funky name like Chocolate Forest Crepe, or something.  The dark chocolate filling was too bitter to be served.  It tasted like melted 80% dark chocolate which shouldn't be served without being something be added to it.  It was also topped with frozen strawberries that were still cold.  Not a pretty picture.  I would be surprised to learn that these were authentic french crepes.  It seemed more like the McDonalds of crepes.  They were also cash only which is ridiculously inconvenient.",

My boyfriend and I decided to try it for an after-church brunch and were delighted with the result. Although this space is small and somewhat tight (perhaps a more charming term would be \"intimate\"), space is at a premium in Oakland and a full house usually means good food. This turned out to be the case. The menu is large enough to please everyone but not overwhelming, and we loved the balance of sweet and savory options.            We both opted for a savory crepe, and were rewarded with filling, comforting dishes, each of which included a side salads complete with a lovely house vinaigrette. But what stood out to me was the croissant and the espresso. I can never eat a regular croissant again without comparing it to the light, buttery goodness experienced here. The thick, rich but not-too-sweet mocha espresso was something to sit and enjoy slowly.            All in all, this is a lovely little place and the fact that it does not have internet is plus in my opinion, since the ambiance is great for conversation as long as it is not too crowded. Will be returning!!",

My one caveat is that seating is always dicey - you order first and then wait for a table to open up; however, it can't be helped since this place is small and pretty popular.",

Did the tourist thing and asked the server to take our picture since we are from out of town and nobody here will ever see is again - she nicely complied. Excellent atmosphere, jazz playing at a perfect level to not interfere with conversation but loud enough to enjoy.  Would definitely come here again.",

They have varieties of chocolates like white, dark, Belgian, hazelnut nutella, etc. as well as your standard fruits like strawberries, bananas, etc.  I prefer their savory crepes over their sweet ones. You can choose from three different sauces: Bechamel, Creme Fraiche, and Garlic Olive Oil. They put the sauce on the side so the crepes don't get soggy. The savory crepes also come with a fresh salad with vinaigrette on the side.  Crepes themselves are soft and more pancake-like than crisp, but the fillings are delicious.  You would normally come here for crepes, but they have amazing paninis as well. Their turkey and avocado one is light but filling. Perfect for lunch.   Only complaint is that they have the oddest hours. Stopped by many times to find that they are closed. Fortunately, Craig Street has many other lunch options. You can usually tell they're open when they put their sign out.",

It's also not usually very crowded here, which makes it the more appealing sibling to its Shadyside location.  Don't forget that it's cash only!  Although sometimes the service can be curt, I have generally found it to be pleasant as long as you follow the protocol (order at the counter, have cash readily on hand, etc).  Also, there is a giant tank of self-serve water and cups at the right side of the counter, which is always a nice touch.  The interior is modern and clean cut, with exposed brick and small wooden tables.  Although their coffee is not the best, I personally think it beats out Starbucks' coffee by a wide margin.  And their espresso-based drinks are very decent.  Definitely the best you will find anywhere on Craig St, that's for sure!",

I happened to be close , as I was taking my husband to the cancer center so we decided to have brunch. I also took my daughters friend from NY along and both of them had eaten here before. Even though my daughter had vowed never return because apparently you can't sit down until you've received your food and they made her get up and wait. We went there because nobody else was serving breakfast.    I have never been verbally attacked by any food industry worker until today. I found out it was actually one of the owners.  I placed my order for 4 meals one to go 3 for restaurant. I asked for an extra outside chair which I did receive from a kind fellow and he carried it outside for me. After paying and receiving our beverages we headed out. My daughters coffee spilled out onto the table because the table was terribly wobbly. I ran into the restaurant and grabbed napkins from a container next to a serve yourself open container of water. Two employees literally chased me down ! One snatched the napkins and said \"those are ours , the sign says right there, don't take.\" I calmly explained I simply wanted to clean up my daughters coffee and there it started... The owner went on a rant about foodborne illnesses and how she wasn't making accusations that I had some disease ,but I shouldn't have touched the napkins and the sign is right there ..in other words I can't read and i'm an idiot.     My daughters friend that was our guest and in the food industry said,\"wow !\" All I can say to her is to maybe see someone for that anger problem or possibly live with cancer for a day . Hopefully she'll see that some things are better off left alone.   Oh and the food was ok . The salad with a few canned mandarin oranges was blah and the crepe was a crepe . Not worth getting torn a new butthole and $40 for sure.",

The French \"panini\" and savory crepes are just as I remembered. The vegetables are always fresh and the mixed greens salad served on the side with vinaigrette is the perfect accompaniment. They also now accept cards (!) and have a liquor license. If you have time to catch up with a friend and take a leisurely lunch, nothing would be better than coming into Crepes Parisiennes on a cold day and splitting a crepe and one of the French ciders that they now carry. Their beer selection is also charmingly French (and French Canadian), and they offer Fin du Monde, one of my favorites. I also love trying new things from their unique tea list.   Recently enjoyed the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe with a crisp cider. A little pricey for portion, but there aren't many similar options in the Oakland area. You can find Liege waffles here as well as in Schenley Plaza, but I like having something more savory in the afternoon. I love the lighting from the big window in front, but overall the decor is pretty minimal.",

The problem was, the only solid strawberries they had were mixed with other berries, which upset me. Because I'm a fairly picky eater, i got a simple Nutella crepe. It was perfectly fine, and i borrowed a few strawberries from my friend, although the stipulations on the menu, once again, were a nuisance. Oh, and what is this... \"Cash only\" thing? I'm sure this loses them half of their potential Pitt student customers Otherwise, it was a delicious dessert that you can't go wrong with at all.",

I had a spinach egg and cheese with a creamy garlic sauce. It was just fabulous because the crepe was light, and the sauce was not too salty. Everything went so well and they served the spinach egg and cheese enclosed in the crepe in a folded thin square form. On the side was mixed greens with a side of dressing and oranges. I was very impressed with my experience. As I'm writing this review a jazzy French music is playing over my head as I watch a couple drink a delicately presented cappuccino. I highly recommend it. And the prices aren't even that bad!",

    "text": "I've started a sort of tradition where every time I want something sweet i go to Crepes Parisiennes, however I've always gone to the one off Walnut street, which I've rated four stars for it's great crepes, awesome ambiance, and great teas.  However, this location has excellent crepes, standard ambiance, and great teas.  The chef here makes a better crepe. Whether the air is drier or her grill is hotter, I'm not sure, but her crepes are crisp on the outside and not overcooked on the inside.  Not that the over location doesn't have the same qualities, but these were better. I get a butter and sugar crepe almost every time I go and when done right, which it almost always is, I go sleep dreaming about it.  I'd also like to take a moment and say for the sake of both locations that I appreciate their commitment to rules and standards. There's a sign on the door that says \"place your order before taking a seat.\"  I go quite frequently and it is still quite rare that I do not see someone attempt to break this rule and take a seat from someone in line. I appreciate the chefs, who I presume are the owners, diligence when it comes to removing these people from the seats they would have taken from people who follow the rules of a fairly standard polite society. Yes, sometimes those people get angry and leave in disgust that anyone would touch their things or ask them to be civil; but, I am here to confirm the suspicion that the people who frequent your restaurant appreciate your actions and return because of it. So thanks.  Oh, and CASH ONLY.",

My friend got the smoked salmon crepe with creme fraiche.  She said she doesn't usually like fish, but this was the only place she made an exception.  So with that compliment, I had to try the salmon on my next visit.  She was right.  It was wonderful.  I also found my sweet spot (pun intended) with the dessert crepe I like best.

It can get pretty busy in here and often there can be a line, but it is worth the wait.  Just as a note: When you go in, you should order first and then find a table. It often can be busy enough that all the tables are full at the moment you walk in. You should wait your turn and order at the counter. Once you have placed your order, take a seat. They will probably not let you order until an open table has popped up. Thus, if it is busy, don't be a jerk (whether you meant it or not) by grabbing a table as soon as you see it open up if you are waiting in line.  Also, if I remember correctly, it is cash only.",

    "text": "This place only takes cash.  Thank goodness there's only a ton of ATMs on the Carnegie Mellon and U. Pitt campus.  Cost:   ~ 7 dollars a crepe depending on what you get  The ordering process is similar to Panera, and La Madeline, where you order, grab a number, and sit down.  Someone will bring the food over and that will probably be the last time you see him/her.  From ordering to receiving food took about 5 minutes or so.  Food Experience from beginning to end: I really loooove crepes, especially sweet crepes.  It's a bit past lunch time and I'm starving.  My sister and I walk in and there's a bunch of folks in there, talking and having a good time.  This place was happening!  This place isn't exactly big.  The seating area is pretty small but it was pretty cozy.  The atmosphere is pretty good as well.  When we walked in, we grabbed the last open table and it wasn't even peak dining time!  I can easily see this place get crowded during lunchtime.  The menu has savory crepes and sweet crepes - savory being the an actual meal, and of course sweet is for dessert.  My sister and I wanted both for lunch so we ordered one of each and decided to split.    For the savory crepe, we tried out the breakfast crepe which contains sausage, egg and cheese.  It comes with a small spinach and mandarin orange salad on the side with a small container of oil and vinagrette dressing.  The salad is very good but also very small.  It's not really there as a side dish but as something there to complement the crepe.  The size of the crepe is not that big as well.  it measured probably 3in by 4 in.  The crepe itself was nothing to write home about.   It contained little salt which is great for me, but for salt lovers out there, this is not the crepe for you.  As for the dessert crepe, I really wanted nutella with fresh strawberries and bananas.  Unfortunately, they don't serve that since they don't have fresh strawberries, just fresh bananas.  The only kind of berries they have is this compote that is super sugary.  Between the rich nutella spread and the berry compote, it was pretty sweet.  The crepe is topped with a generous portion of whipped cream.  The whip cream is actually not sweet at all.  I ate my crepe with the cream to balance out the sugar a bit.     In summary, I think this place is really cute for atmosphere and nice to have when you need a crepe fix.  It's really a nice place to hang out with friends and crepes are easily sharable.  I enjoyed my experience here but it doesn't make it on my \"omg i must return to eat here\" list for the next time I visit Pittsburgh.",

I also might have given them more stars if their name didn't involve Paris, but since they're trying to say they are Parisian Crepes, they just don't get that fourth star.   The crepes in Paris were light and fine and warm and just sweet enough and simply perfect. The butter and sugar crepe here lacked in the following ways: 1) granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar, 2) folded into an untransportable square, 3) dripping in butter, 4) practically fried in butter so the sugar caramelized. Again, it was tasty indeed. But if you are expecting to get Parisian style and quality crepes, this is not the place :(",

The lines get long and seating is limited. It is best to eat your crepes immediately so you'll want to try to dine in if you can. Unfortunately it's a small place. I stopped by for lunch here after checking out Carnegie Museum of Art and was only able to snag a table because I ate lunch at 3pm. It's a great place for lunch and/or dessert seeing as crepes aren't particularly \"heavy\" and the food comes out quickly. My smoked Icelandic salmon crepe was decent - while the salmon did not seem seasoned in the slightest, salmon has its own natural flavor that prevents it from being bland. The crepe itself was just ok and came with creme fraiche and a lemon wedge for much needed flavor. The side salad was basic and refreshing with the light, tarty dressing that was provided. I also got the cafe au lait and was rather disappointed in the presentation. Nowadays it is all about the latte art and to be honest, part of the reason why I ordered the cafe au lait was because I saw a photo of it on Yelp with a gorgeous leaf design. Mine came out looking like a deformed heart at best but at least the taste was average.",

Their hours are slightly disappointing, but I can't blame them considering it's just the two of them running the place. The one tip I have is that the seating here is limited. They cannot easily accommodate large groups, so keep that in mind.",

I visited on a Tuesday around 12:30. It was tiny inside, and it was packed, but the food was totally worth the wait! Actually, I was slightly relieved that there was a line, so that I could have time to decide on my order because the menu was pretty extensive in terms of crepes and waffles.    I finally (after serious contemplation) decided on the smoked salmon crepe with creme fraiche sauce.  All savory crepes included a side salad, so I had a salad with mandarin oranges and champagne vinaigrette.  My salad was really good, but my crepe was even better....I never wanted it to end! The smokey flavor and saltiness was exactly what I was expecting (and hoping for) when I ordered it!   When I was leaving, I noticed that some people were stopping in and taking crepes to go, I will have to remember to treat myself to one of their dessert crepes soon! I would strongly recommend it to those looking for a change in their regular lunch break routine!",

    "text": "I've eaten here a lot over the years but just finally got around to reviewing the place. In fact, I've been a customer long before they opened this brick and mortar store, I used to get crepes from the cart they used to operate on CMU's campus on the corner of Margaret Morrison and Tech streets.   I don't eat a lot of sweets so I unfortunately can't comment on their sweet offerings, but the savory crepes are awesome. I've had about every possible combination of savory ingredients and sauces by this point and I've never had a bad crepe. My absolute favorite is the ham and cheese with mushrooms and bechamel sauce. Perfect.  I've also had a panini once, wasn't at all impressed with it. Never tried another because, well, the crepes are too good to risk a visit on another panini. :)  Despite being surrounded by dedicated coffee houses, this is the best place to get a cup of coffee for at least a 4 block radius of Craig St between 5th and Forbes. I've never gotten a coffee drink, just plain old house coffee, and it's always been good. They also have a great selection of specialty teas and strangely enough hard ciders.  Some of their pricing is a little on the high side but food quality and good service will help lessen that sting.   You could experience a lengthy wait if you go during peak lunch/dinner times. They only have so many cooking surfaces and each crepe is cooked with love and care so be patient or plan your visit accordingly.   All in all, if you are in the area, this a place well worth visiting.  Also worth mentioning, they DO accept cards now. They are no longer a cash only establishment so don't let the older reviews sway your choice.",

    "text": "The food was good and it did not take long to get after ordering.   Only reason I am giving them a pour review because of the service. My friend and I waited for about 20 minutes of standing in line, waiting to order. Several times they stopped taking orders because there were no tables for customers, waiting to order, to sit at. They allowed a girl and her friend to jump the line and order when they stopped taking orders from others, because she already had a table after ordering a drink earlier. Rules should of applied to her too of first come, first served. Not whoever has a table can get food. Otherwise, I would of ignored their signs asking people not to save tables, grabbed a table, and had my friend jump the line to order for us.   They also asked two tables, who already got their orders and sat down, to move to other open tables so that a group of four could sit together. This is rude and would not be acceptable at other restaurants. The group should of split up or waited for a table to become available to them.  The restaurant is probably not this chaotic and weird on a week day, but it needs better structure. It should be run like a restaurant, where people looking to sit and eat, should sit first and then have someone order. And if the place gets crowded, people should be warned of the time it is going to take to get food when they first enter. More than half of the people who waited in line eventually left because of the ridiculous set up of ordering and sitting.",

Simple enough, but on the Sunday afternoon that I found myself here, I found it took far longer than I expected to just order.  All the tables were filled and there were a fair number coming in for takeout as well. I ordered the smoked salmon crepe, which came with a salad and it was just okay. Pretty expensive for a not-so-generous portion of salmon that wasn't very flavorful even with the creme fraiche. Service was really friendly and the atmosphere was calm as the place began to clear out a bit. My friend had a sweet crepe, which he enjoyed quite a bit so maybe I need to come back and give this place another try.   They take credit cards now!",

    "text": "SETTING: Easy to miss along the street (keep an eye out for their blue sign). Hardwood floors, clean, small and cozy, seats parties of 2-4 people, open kitchen if you want to sneak a peak. Casual. Top 40s music playing in the background.  FOOD: Looking for some light brunch? Need to take a break from the craziness that is your world? Get yourself a \"Crepe Escape\".  Savory or sweet, choose your own adventure. I usually like savory breakfast/brunch foods, but I had to switch it up this once. There are just so many sweet options that all look delicious! If you like Nutella, berries, chocolate, they got you covered.     I went with the banana waffle crepe. It's what you would imagine how it would taste. Drizzled in syrup. Slices of banana hiding inside. Walnuts sprinkled on the plate with whipped cream on the side. I tried to go slow, but probably still wolfed it down relatively quickly. Not too sweet and definitely not heavy.       SERVICE: Cash monies only. Order up front and they give you a number before you seat yourself. Self-serve for water. They will bring out your order to your seat once it's out (less than 10 minutes).    IMPRESSIONS: Portion size was okay. I definitely wouldn't mind a larger quantity since I was quite hungry (what else is new). Perfect for a light meal when you catch up with a friend. If you're looking for something light and tasty, this fits the bill perfectly. I kind of wish they had a better selection of music (jazz, french, etc) to round out the cafe atmosphere. Top 40s seemed a bit out of place. The place gets busy though, so come early!",

    "text": "Abandon all credit cards, ye who enter here - this is a cash-only establishment.   Savory: The savory crepes are good, but not great. For starters, they are not nearly as filling as similarly priced crepes I have had in the past. If you go on an empty stomach, I highly suggest ordering a panini instead. The most impressive savory crepe on the menu is the smoked salmon. I was hoping for a more inspired menu, but the options are pretty run-of-the-mill.   Sweet: I suggest veering away from the savory and opting for a sweet crepe instead. They're ideal for a light dessert. If you're like me and have a constant hankering for Nutella, this is a quick, easy way to satiate your sweet tooth. Pair it with some chocolat chaud and you've struck the formula for sugar-induced bliss.   The ambience is...unexpected. The decor suggests intimate french cafe, but this is undermined by a soundtrack of top 40's hits. Pro tip: bring along a friend, drown out the music in conversation, and you can pretend for a few minutes that you're sipping lattes in France.",

So unfortunately, I was hoping to do a savory crepe for an early dinner, but they stop serving savory crepes after lunchtime, which is a total bummer.  I decided to go with a dessert one and got the banana and chocolate crepe ($6.84), and it came with homemade whipped cream!  They also offered to put walnuts on the crepe, but I don't care for walnuts.  That homemade whipped cream was delicious and light and perfect.  The actual crepe was fairly standard and expected.  The price point felt high, but I have paid double this for a crepe in other cities so I probably shouldn't complain.  The staff was nice but already mostly cleaned up to close. Don't push it too much and try walking in her close to closing because I doubt they would serve you.  They brought a water and my crepe to the table, which was really nice.  The atmosphere is cute and peaceful, and they do not have wifi, which is the best.  I am so sick of wifi hogs taking over anywhere they can because they \"can't work/study at home.\"  It's called self-discipline, people.  Get some.  I loved just sitting here peacefully.  Overall, this is a nice plate to sit and treat yourself.  Credit cards accepted.",

    "text": "Crepes are my new favorite breakfast/brunch item and Crepes Parisiennes did not disappoint. A lot of options to choose from and the service was quick and friendly.   This is one of those places where you order, they give you a number, and they bring it out to you based on your order number so don't waste time; go straight to the counter and put in your order. My husband and I were both feeling a savory crepe so we each got the ham and cheese, but with different sauces. What I like about Crepes Parisiennes is that they give you your choice of sauce, which I haven't seen at too many other locations. They had four choices so I got the bechamel (traditional creamy sauce) and he got the creme fraiche (like a sour cream). The bechamel was rich and very comforting, yet not too incredibly rich. It was nice that a salad came with the savory crepes to add some fresh flavor.   Crepes aren't the only thing on the menu. There was a variety of paninis, pastries, and other breakfast/brunch/lunch items. Their liege waffle looked absolutely amazing from what I could see on the plates of other diners there.   Overall, there was nothing to complain about during my visit as the food was tasty and the service was great. I plan on revisiting to try a sweet crepe or waffle for sure!",

    "text": "I am writing the same review for Cafe Moulin and Crepes Parisiennes.  To me, they both have excellent crepes and coffee. And I have happy to go into either of them any day. The only difference is where I am at the time, and how big a party I have.   Crepes Parisiennes is on S Craig St. Street parking if you are driving and good luck finding a space on Craig. The shops have ~10 tables, and its customer base is Pitt + CMU + UPMC.  Small shop means it is likely packed.  Go in, line-up, order, find a table, and they bring the food to you when ready.  Definitely should try this out if you are a student nearby.  Cafe Moulin is in Shadyside, Walnut Street area, next to a parking lot. About ~25 tables I guess.  At least I never have to wait in the line.  Go in, they will find you a table, and the waiter will take your order and bring the food over.  If you are driving, or with a big party (6+), I would prefer Cafe Moulin.  Foodwise, cappuccino, Latte, chocolate strawberry crepe, smoked salmon crepe... I am going to say Cafe Moulin's smoked salmon crepe (Alaskan) has more salmon than Crepes Parisiennes... but it is also more expensive ($11 vs $10)... and it might be just that day.  So don't take my words for it.",

    "text": "I've dropped by this place maybe four times in the past year. I'm a believer in giving things the benefit of the doubt, but my experiences here have somehow gotten worse every visit.   First thing you'll notice is that there are a lot of signs telling you what you are not allowed to do. You cannot sit until you've ordered. You cannot order until they have a table that can accommodate your group. You cannot order savory crepes past 4pm. You cannot take pictures. So on and so on. I would not describe this place as welcoming nor would I call it customer-oriented.   I've had off-putting encounters here with a tall, brunette, female server  who occasionally runs the cash register. She seems to be there every time I've dropped by. I've been outright scolded by her for sitting in the \"wrong\" seat once. I've also had her flip over the menu to the evening selection, refusing to serve me a savory crepe as it was five minutes until 4pm. This is all fine; I usually let this stuff roll off my back.   What prompted me to write this review was a recent experience where I had some friends of mine visiting Pittsburgh. I assumed that maybe the service has been iffy due to the high influx of college students during the school year, so I assumed bringing my friends here for a summer breakfast would be a little more sane. Lo and behold, the same server bumped into my friend, who was just standing in line waiting to order, on her way back to the kitchen. He apologized out of courtesy and she responded with nothing but a stink-eyed glare for the rest of our meal. Simply ridiculous.   The seating is awkward, the plastic cups and containers are tacky, and the crepes are just alright. Save yourself the sanity and get your crepes up on Murray Avenue.",

Their seating system seems a little frustrating at first, but it's truly for the best; just be prepared to wait for 10-20 minutes for a seat during peak times, and don't try to hold seats before you've reached the front of the line.  Every single savory crepe is delicious, although my favorite is the tomato and cheese. If you like dark chocolate, the dark forest sweet crepe is definitely the way to go!

There was no wait for a party of three at 2pm on a Sunday, but I would imagine it can get pretty crowded as the restaurant is pretty small -- seats around 20-30 people. FYI this place takes credit card now (apparently it wasn't a couple years before).  I was pretty hungry and the crepes seemed on the smaller size for the price, so my brother and I got the ham and cheese panini and turkey tomato and avocado panini. Portions were very filling--sandwiches come with a basic salad with a housemade champagne vinaigrette that was simple but refreshing. The ham and cheese panini was really good but the turkey was just mediocre. What stood out were the drinks! If you have never had European/South American hot chocolate, I would definitely recommend trying it out as you will never want to drink powdered Nesquik again (my childhood favorite rip). French style hot chocolate typically uses whole milk and bittersweet chocolate so definitely be prepared to expect it to be very rich. Coffee was also pretty good. Overall, I would definitely come back here again to try the crepes.",

My friend had the smoked Icelandic salmon which he says is phenomenal.  The service was surprisingly quick for the amount of people ordering. We all received our meals within 5-7 minutes of ordering.

You walk up, order, get a number than sit and wait for your treats. They have a large sweet Menu. The savory side is compact the only protein they have is Salmon and unless I missed something on the menu? They also have hard cider and beer. Things from France, Belgium and local stuff. Staff is pleasant and friendly. When you order your savory crepe you also get with it a side of mixed greens with mandarin orange segments and a small container of house made vinaigrette. I got the Mushroom and Cheese with the house sauce inside it was savory and slightly spicy. My husband got the salmon one and said it was quite good. Mine was just the right amount out savory and tasty. I could have eaten more.. I believe it was a buckwheat crepe. Crepes are something I don't have on the regular or actually there are few stand alone restaurants that do just this. It was nice to just sit down, have a quick meal that was not fast food. We walked over, parking would be street or a lot? I nice visit, give them a whirl",

First of all, both of us a French and we know a thing or two about the crepes, as well as hold very strong convictions as to what they should taste like. We were not expecting much, although we both had a craving for some crepes.   Our expectations were exceeded. Not only the crepes were good and pretty authentic in themselves (except the part that the salted ones were not made with buckwheat flour, but hey - we are in the US after all and that probably would fail to sell), the internal decoration and drinks coming with them were pretty authentic. Given it was a morning and we had a long road ahead of us, we grabbed some tea rather than cider (Mariage Freres was a very compelling choice, given how hard they are to find in the US) and thoroughly enjoyed our salted crepes, adding a dessert one to share on top of the two salted ones we took at first.  I would absolutely recommend this place to whoever wants to discover what authentic French Crepes taste like, as well as those who would miss their taste.",

I didn't care too much for the side salad, but the crepe itself was so fresh and delicious. The Soytang sauce was an awesome complement to the crepe itself!

Despite a substantial line, we miraculously managed to get a table.  With such a large group, we got to try a lot of the menu, and we loved everything! Some highlights:  On the banana Nutella crepe: \"some places skimp on the Nutella, but this place really adds a lot!\"  On the breakfast crepe: \"there's so much cheese!\"  On the mozzarella/pesto panini: \"this is amazing!\"  I personally went with the mixed vegetable crepe (with tomato, mushroom, and cheese), and I really liked the flavor and texture of the crepe itself. The French toast crepe is also definitely worth trying  Also their drip coffee is pretty good, and they have a wonderful tea selection (mariage freres)!  I would highly recommend, just be warned that you might not be able to sit here",

There is almost always a line on the weekends.  You must wait in line prior to getting a table. This is how they manage the seating.  At first it can seem annoying, but they know what they are doing and it works out perfectly everyone that you have a table ready for you once you have ordered.  I order the same thing everytime.  Ham, cheese, add spinach and bechemel crepe.  Simple and delicious.  The side salad with the beautiful vinaigrette pairs perfectly.  It looks small, but the portion is hearty and filling.   If I am feeling hungry and have a dining partner, I'll also get a classic Nutella and banana crepe with the whipped crepe and walnuts. It's so decadent and just the right vessel for warm Nutella.  And now I'm craving crepes!!",

But if you're really set on not having crepes, don't worry, they also offer salads, liege waffles, and French toast. They also have a beverage menu with very classic French lattes/coffee/hot chocolate. My go-to on the menu is the butter sugar crepe with a side of maple syrup. I am known for never finishing a meal but I can eat the entire thing. I also really like the breakfast crepe (egg, sausage, cheese) with soy tang sauce. Really though, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!",

The crepe itself was so delicate and the toppings, cheese and blueberry, were so fresh and delicious. I am used to them having chocolate, or Nutella, with whipped cream, which always felt like those flavors carried the crepe. But in this case, all the components worked together to make a delicious, delicate treat that I will be going back for.   To top it off, I tried one of their chocolate croissant and that was so flaky, with great chocolate, and warm!",

No problem - I just asked the waitress to kindly bring me some. She comes back, and after placing the whipped cream on my plate, tells me that I would have to pay for it. I would have to pay for whipped cream that was supposed to be on my plate to begin with? She told me I had to pay because I asked after ordering instead of before. Not only does that make little sense to begin with, but why would I ask for something that I thought would already come with the dish? And why wasn't I informed before the whipped cream was brought out that I would have to pay? She shrugged and said nothing. I am disappointed in so many ways at how this place handled a simple customer request. The crepes are okay, but the unprofessional way this place seems to be run completely ruined the experience for me.",

I would recommend the savory crepes, simply because they come with a side salad and also have some more flavor variety. You have to get your own water from the pay area, and the staff seem nice enough. You pick where you want to sit, and if you go when it's not too busy, it's a good, reasonably priced place to get a good crepe in a nice setting.",

I wouldn't change a thing about it. It takes a certain place to be a semi sitdown fast little shop and make it feel as classy as it was. If you have never had or heard of a savory crepe stop what you are doing right now. park your car in the street if you have to and just sprint here for one right now. my personal favorite, the tomato and cheese, with bechamel was the perfet combination of savory and sweet in a healthy (enough) package. with a cup of coffee in a real ceramic cup, it makes for the best brunch or lunch in the city. every savory crepe is served with a fresh salad with mandarin oranges, overall impressive presentation and absolutely fantastic flavor. There is no excuse for not eating here, even if you have no cahs (it's cash only) there is a pnc atm at the corner of craig and 5th. get moeny and treat yourself to the best crepe you will ever have.",

It'd be nice if the hours were extended a bit (I'm not sure about the logic involved in closing at 5PM...it's hard to imagine the 4 to 5 hour being more profitable than 5 to 6 would be), so you pretty much have to come for brunch or lunch.

My friend and I paid separately for our food, I don't know why it would seem like we were sharing, my food got delayed (or maybe even forgotten) and I got an attitude for pointing it out. That was rude and was bad business.",

The menu stays very close to its core but with good variety on both the sweet and savory sides.   We enjoyed the salmon and mushroom versions and then shared a black forest for dessert. All were very pleasing.   The staff was very attentive and when I got in line for our dessert intervened and told me to come to the counter.   A good policy as especially on a Saturday morning the crowd was substantial.   So we recommend early arrival on the weekend and that you make the time for a visit.",

The hot chocolate is amazing in the winter. The only thing I don't like is that you can only take a seat after ordering, so it's easy for the inside to become crowded very often. The food itself and the service is superb though.",

    "text": "I've been here once before, a while ago.  It's a cute place to have breakfast, lunch, or brunch during the weekend, specializing in crepes, as the name suggests.  I came for lunch on a Sat., and had a savory crepe with salmon, creme fraiche, and capers.  I recall it tasting fresh and delicious, though the specifics escape me since it's been awhile.  As a first-timer, I didn't have any problems with the service.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, which is bright, clean, and cozy.  I'd definitely like to come back to try a sweet crepe--if they were open during the evenings, I'd surely already have done this.  Their hours are 9am-5pm, which are a bit inconvenient during the week for those of us who work, esp. if we don't work nearby.  Cash only, but there's an ATM half a block away, on the corner of Craig and Fifth.  4.5 stars.",

No, I was completely satisfied! I loved everything from the coffee and crepes down to the music they were playing.   The only thing that was slightly annoying was the fact that they don't accept cards, just cash. That was easily resolved since there is an atm right next door. It very easy to order, everything is right there in front of you on a big menu board. The waitress was very helpful as well. We ordered our food and sat down. They bring you everything when it's done.  The room itself is very relaxing and is a place I could just sit and read all day (while eating crepes of course). I had gotten nutella and banana crepes. Can I just say that nutella is just amazing and I'm pretty sure it's just melted gold! So obviously it was delicious. I was pretty happy with the crepe size as well. I was expecting just two small crepes that had been rolled up. No, they give you this big crepe that's been folded over a couple times. My boyfriend's savory crepe came with a salad. His was also delicious, but of course mine was better.. nutella, duh. Oh and the coffee was great as well, I got the espresso and hot chocolate drink. Why is this the first time I've seen this? Though I think the espresso is still in my system after three days.  Also the kitchen is an open kitchen and it was amazingly clean! I mean you would hope all restaurants you go to have clean kitchens, but that's not how it always is. I mean I felt like that was just a show kitchen and all the cooking was actually done in the back!   We are actually going back again this week! I mean we have to try everything on the menu, that's the only fair way to judge a place! Maybe I should find a gym near by...",

You can also see into the kitchen.  I ordered a hot chocolate which was the best part of my breakfast. It was thick and creamy and not sweet at all--pure chocolatey goodness. I also got a Black Forest Crepe, which was filled with dark chocolate and topped with raspberry preserves. All their sweet crepes are topped with fresh whipped cream and walnuts as well. The cream really does taste much better. The crepe was good as well, though very rich.  My dad ordered a spinach and cheese crepe, which was also good. All savory crepes come with a salad.  This place was delicious, but a bit on the pricey side. I'll probably only return on special occasions.",

Offerings range from sweet crepes, savory crepes, paninis and pastries. I've only had the black forest sweet crepe but I can't wait to try out everything else on the menu.It was the perfect size for one person and comes with whip cream and walnuts. I did expect the whip cream to be sweeter but it could of been the sweetness of the chocolate overshadowing that of the whip cream.  The most outstanding part of the experience was the customer service. I came in 15 minutes before closing and the employees were just as accommodating and welcoming. I even overheard a customer come in asking for coffee and because they didn't have any left since they were about to close, they offered a free cup of tea. That's what I call impeccable service!",

    "text": "My 5 stars are only for the SAVORY CREPES. I've never had savory crepes before this. Ever since trying Crepes Parisiennes, I've tried savory crepes at various places because I'm always hoping I can find a crepe place just as good as this place wherever I'm at, but they never live up to my expectations. Why? Because the savory crepes at Crepes Parisiennes are the best, hands down.   My favorite is the ham and spinach with bechamel sauce. The bechamel sauce is freaking bomb. It's not only the ingredients they use, but the way they fry their crepes that make it oh-so-tasty. The crepe itself is very thin and fried to a light golden brown color with a hint of sweetness. I'm a damn slow eater, but i can devour this thing in 5 minutes. I've also tried their ham and cheese as well as salmon, both are pretty good. All the savory crepes come with a small portion of green salad with a lightly flavored vinaigrette sauce - tastes good. I'm not a fan of sweet crepes so I've never had any of them, but they are cheaper than the savory ones.   I've also had their house coffee, french latte, and hot chocolate with steamed milk. They were all whatever. House coffee is probably the best bang for your bucks but can sometimes be sour. French latte was too dark and bitter for my liking, and the hot chocolate left a nasty after taste. I had to gargle my mouth with water a few times afterwards.   When i think of savory crepes, i think of this place and this place only.   Warning: Place is cash only which is a downside, but I'd make a trip to the ATM any day for this place.",

It doesn't look like much from the outside and it's hard to see in from the small window and being raised up from the street so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It just seemed dark and small.  But when I went in it looked like a little French cafe with a decent amount of seating.  They have a really nice range of crepes, from savory to sweet, including some breakfast crepes with egg.  They also have some salads and paninis.  I had the ham, egg and cheese breakfast crepe with a bechamel sauce that came with a small side salad of spring greens and vinaigrette.  The coffee made from the espresso bar is also excellent.  It looked like they had free wifi and some people were there working on their laptops.  Seemed like a good place to either eat there or get a quick crepe to go.  Service (that you order at the counter) was quick and friendly.  Prices were very affordable. I'll definitely. go back.  Only drawback is hours are somewhat limited with them closing mid-afternoon.",

The space is small, and we passed up a visit one weekend day when the line was out the door thinking that there would be nowhere to sit when we got our order. Parking is street only, so you may have to cruise around a little. This establishment seems to attract lots of students from the area colleges. As you walk to the counter, the menu is on the wall to the left. You make your selections, place the order, and then grab a seat. The service has been quick on each visit, and the staff was always pleasant. The choices are for either savory or sweet crepes. We usually each order a savory, and then we share the sweet. That works out and leaves us satisfied. I ordered the Smoked Icelandic Salmon with creme fraiche, and tasted the Breakfast Crepe with the bechamel sauce that my daughter ordered. I would recommend either one. There are other sauce choices that we have never tried. The savory crepes come with a side of greens which I could easily pass up. We finished on our most recent visit with a simple apricot crepe, but we have tried some of the other combinations...all good. We usually just get the savory and sweet at the same time. They offer you the opportunity for delay on the sweet, and we should probably do that because the whipped cream is melting into the crepe by the time we get to it. This is a good place to visit anytime you are in the mood for a quick crepe.",

Anyone who knows what it is like to have a handicap parent, knows that for new places, we call ahead. Coming from the Shadyside community a few minutes away, we called in advance to ask about ingredients, time wait, and handicap accessibility. We were told there was no wait, room, and reviewed allergies.  They said they cannot save seats. I said that's okay. Be three in less than 5! Needless to say, when I arrived, there was very limited room. However, we found some tables for my handicap mother and 2 year old. I was approached by the waitress who said those seats were saved and we couldn't sit there. There were groups waiting for 20+ minutes.  I was shocked about the \"seat yourself\" \"no saving seats\" and the call ahead to find out. She said, \"well you didn't talk to me\".  Got baby bundles back up, & Packed up mom and left. Will never return to a place with such lack of communication and rude employees. Such a waste of time and effort. Well below standards.

The brick walls, French music, and sweet smell wafting through the small foyer is enough to make me want to buy a bus pass because the 2 hour parking on Craig Street simply isn't cutting it.   I think my favorite thing on the menu has got to be their breakfast crepe with bechamel sauce. The crepes are light and delicious, and the bechamel sauce is rich and creamy. I'm pretty sure that if utopia had a national food, it would be this breakfast crepe.   All of the savory crepes come with perfect little side salads, complete with house vinaigrette and little mandarin orange wedges. Couple that with a cafe au lait and I'm basically in heaven. Oh, and you ought to probably have a sweet crepe while you're there, as well. Why? Because Nutella, that's why.  If you're planning on going, be sure to bring cash and check their hours!",

We ordered a turkey-avocado-tomato-cheese panini to share, then a nutella banana crepe for me, and a nutella crepe with berries for my husband. We also ordered a french hot chocolate each. The girl at the counter offered to bring out the panini first and the crepes later if we wanted, and so that's what we did. We got our hot chocolate first. It was rich and thick, but a little too bitter for my taste. My husband really enjoyed it, though. We were then brought the panini, which came with a side salad and some sort of vinaigrette dressing. The bread was thick and crusty, cheese perfectly melted, good portions of meat, and perfectly grilled. Around 10 mins after we finished our panini, the waitress brought us our crepes . Each one was filled with so much warm and melty nutella! Yummmm! They also came topped with walnuts and whipped cream. The crepes were thinner than those I had eaten at chain breakfast places. They were so good, we both wiped our plates clean. There's so many varieties to still try! The waitstaff was attentive and friendly, even though it was so crowded,  and there was a perpetual line at the counter from the time we came in to the time we left.
