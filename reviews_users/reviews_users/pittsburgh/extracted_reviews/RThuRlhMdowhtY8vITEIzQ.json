Parking is a bit of a problem, but once inside it just smells good, too. They also deliver frozen pizzas anywhere in the US, because it really is that good. Anything less than 5 stars would be a crime.",

They have a happy hour Monday through Wednesday 9pm-10pm that has $2 off drinks (which are moderately priced to begin with). The drinks are perfectly made and the bartenders are similar to how I imagine the bartenders on Cheers would be towards non-regulars like Norm or Frasier. The servers are also very sweet and give great service. The basic cheese pizza is pretty good, but I've had a few different topping combinations and they have all been delicious.",

Granted its better than most chain pizza but that's not saying much. It is sickeningly greasy. And yes...people always said it was greasy but I used to disagree. It used to be an acceptable amount of grease given the amount of cheese you were getting and not so much you couldn't deal with it with a napkin. I ordered a to-go pizza because I was really excited to share the love with an uninitiated pizza eater. There was so much grease it soaked through the box and damaged the front seat of my car. Keep in mind...I didn't spill or tilt the pizza. That was literally from it soaking through the box. Gross. Also the flavor has gone downhill. What happened? Where is my beloved Mineo's? I would mourn this loss but my mourning would only make me want Old Mineos pizza to drown my sorrows thus creating an infinite loop of despair.",

The pizza tastes about as good as it looks in the pictures.   There are a few restaurants here in pittsburgh that have high reviews but not good food like Primanti brothers.

    "text": "Jekyll and Hyde was first published in 1886, but the issue here is much older, and more important. It's that $1M pizza question: \"dine-in or take-out?\" The pie is going to change in some way during the ride home, it always does. You lift that box cover up and hope your warm, respectable favorite is still inside. You fear a cold, mangled monster.  So are you for take-out or dine-in? I dine-in 99% of the time. Fresher, hotter, no sliding in the box, no temptation to sneak slices while driving, no mess on your car or carpet, easier clean up and no disposal of a cardboard box that doesn't fit in the trash or recycling. The promise of the Pizza+Beer+TV trifecta calls from the comfort of your couch, but I prefer my pies dine-in any time. Ok, not March Madness.  Not Mineo's. The restaurant has captured a nostalgia with its ambiance. Dimly lit cafeteria tables and comfortless booths transform into a cozy family spot like the days of \"Book-It\". Littering the walls are pizza awards (some two-decades old) and the owner's mullet-heavy family portraits (all two decades old). Love it. The soda machine glows. The counter is crowded and the boisterous kitchen loud. All that's missing is Contra in the corner.  Yet even with ALL that, don't dine-in. Mineo's pizza NEEDS that 15 minute ride home. The quarter-inch layer of mozz will bleed out grease if you dine-in when it's scalding hot. Multiple paper plates will be soaked through. You'll need another soda halfway through to wash down the extreme salt from the sauce and pepperoni. Plastic forks and knives will melt and bend as you try to cut through the chewy yet grease-soggy crust. You laugh--\"Use a fork and knife?\" The cheese will slide off if you don't, guaranteed.   So enjoy mineo's, which is at the lower end of Pittsburgh's best pizza. And yes, DO try this at home.",

Mineo's is a sweeter pizza, with plenty of cheese and an always crispy toasted crust. There is an art to eating Mineo's when you order in--you can't eat it immediately. Wait a couple minutes for it to cool down, but not too long! Mineo's is at it's very best when eaten fresh.   This spot is always bustling, and the shop has recently taken over three full storefronts: a causal pizza parlor, an ice cream area, and restaurant/bar. There is a full bar in the restaurant, and beer in coolers in the other section. I was surprised how great the selection is! I've found some really hard to find stuff tucked away in the coolers.  The only downside to this spot is it's cash only, all the time. It's fine for a few slices, but can be tough if I want to grab a drink or entree. Not too much to complain about, always happy to snack on a slice.",

The pizza is still as awesome and cheesy as ever, served searing hot by friendly young Pitt students.  It's the perfect proporition of toppings vs. sauce and cheese.  I used to pair my pizza up with grape Welches soda, but they've definitely stepped up the game with their beer cooler, which is fully stocked with a stellar selection of IPAs and artisan beer.  They kind of had me at Lagunitas Little Sumpin, my favorite beer of all time.  Anyways, I highly recommend and vow not to let so many years go by before I return.",

    "text": "\"It's nasty. It's so nasty I crave it.\"   \"The cheese is so thick it's like eating a steak!\"  Those are not my words. Those are the words uttered by a lifetime fan of Mineo's when I asked him where I can find the best pizza and why. I was so perplexed by his use of the word \"nasty\" in such a positive manner that I had to try the food. So after watching \"20 Feet from Stardom\" at The Manor Theater, we went to try Mineo's  Like many of the pizza parlors in the area, you must order at the counter. Our order: Italian Wedding Soup Meatballs Parmesan  16\" Pepperoni Pizza  It's amazing how many people come in and out of Mineo's, most leaving with only a slice and never taking a seat. I was able to watch the interactions, comings, and goings of the other patrons as I waited in one of the wooden booths. The arrival of he soup was a welcome distraction due to my hunger.  I liked the fact that the soup was not overly complex and that the broth had a strong cheese flavor to it. So many places like to add too many extra items to an already busy soup. I was happy that Mineo's version relied on the main ingredients. I returned to people watching after finishing the soup and waited on the rest of the food to arrive.  The pizza and meatballs arrived a short time later. As hot as the pizza was, I decided to try the meatballs first so as not to scorch my mouth too bad. The flavor of the meatballs were okay. They bordered on having too much filler for my taste. The sauce was the same way, it tasted like the balance of spice to base was a but off. I ate half a meatball and left the rest for others.  I looked over at the pizza and took in the pretty image it created in my mind. I didn't see any pepperoni on it, but figured it must be in there somewhere. Taking a piece, I tested the heat and then took a bite.  \"The cheese is so thick it's like eating a steak!\"  That description came back to me at that moment. And it was not undercooked like so many other pizza places that like it pile on cheese. All of the cheese was melted and it was even browned and bubbling on top - big plus! The pepperoni was hidden within the vast sea of cheese. Personally, I prefer my pepperoni to be on top so that it can crisp, but the  pepperoni they used was fairly tasty even hidden from view.   The one detractor from the pizza was the sauce. In my opinion, it was almost over seasoned. The closer I came to the crust, the thicker the sauce, and the flavor, became. I like the Italian spices, but they are easily overdone very much in the same way that cumin is overdone in many Hispanic foods.  I will be eating at Mineo's again, my friends really enjoyed the cheesiness.",

Crusty yellow dough with flour along for the ride. And of course gobs and gobs of salty cheese. Does have a tendency to slide off on the first (piping hot) bite but I'm used to it.  Most of the time I get plain pizza but also enjoy their mushroom. Since they put their toppings under the cheese the canned mushrooms work really well. I always avoid pepperoni as if I ever do order it somewhere I want it crispy and you won't get that here.

I'm confused about my emotions, clearly.  Disclaimer:  I did not order a pie here, only two slices.  Mineo's crust is unique.  It's thin but not like cheap Pizza Hut burnt-to-a-crisp-thin pizza.  It's almost like the dough doesn't rise the whole way or something, but it worked for me.  The sauce was ok, not too special.  But I love cheese, and this pizza was swimming in cheese.  It was pretty fast for my two slices to come out, and at $1.70/slice, not terribly priced.  I actually had really friendly service while I was there so I'm not sure about those complaints.  The tables were a little dirty and some weirdos were sitting inside.  Not pizza items were super slow, but it's not a huge kitchen.  I wasn't totally shocked by that.  I would come back here for a few slices on a laid-back night.  Cash Only",

    "text": "After hearing so much hype about the rivalry between Mineo's and Aiello's, I was expected to be blown away by our meal. On the contrary, I was extremely disappointed. We had a group of 6 and were quickly seated at a large round table by the window. Our server was very nice and suggested that we wait a little to order drinks since we were there just before happy hour. I always appreciate someone looking to help us save a few bucks!  The wings that we ordered to share were very good. Huge in size, cooked very well and great flavor. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the pizza. The pizza was half mushroom and onion and half pepperoni and onion. There were about 5 times as many onions as there needed to be. The pizza was also not cooked nearly enough, so a sea of cheese fell off as you tried to pull a slice of pizza from the tray. I never thought I could possibly complain about too much cheese, but it happened. I had to try to eat it with a knife and fork because it was so moist and soft. We didn't even take the leftover pizza with us.   I hope this was a one-time mistake, but I won't be very likely to go back for pizza.",

I ordered 2 slices of their regular pizza with 4 vegetable toppings. The crust was cooked perfectly and the sauce was awesome. The vegetable toppings covered the entire top of the pizza. Incredible. I was waited on by a great guy named Paul. He was patient, funny, and incredibly personable. Instead of being arrogant because I was new to this Pittsburgh Food Landmark, he was more than happy to explain the process and history of the place. We talked for 10 minutes because no one else was in line at the time. His kindness and sense of humor were refreshing. It made me proud to be from the \"Burgh\".  Bill Crawford, Randy, and Val from DVE were right about this place, it's awesome! I'm definitely going back.",

Admittedly we went here on recommendation and never actually tried their primary competitor whose name I can never remember how to spell, so I can't directly compare. The pizza here has fairly generous portions of everything and the flavors are all what they should be (though the cheese was a bit too salty last time). The crust has a delicious doughy flavor. It's oily and the cheese can slide off, but that's all part of the appeal.  For whatever reason, after a few years of living in Chicago, the pizza somehow didn't quite taste as good as I remembered. Perhaps my taste adapted to the more cracker-like crust of Chicago-style thin crust, or the slightly reduced cheese levels on Chicago-style thin crust. (I literally only had deep dish twice; nobody actually eats those things.) But in any case, Mineo's is still very much a solid pizza choice.",

We ordered a large pizza, half pepperoni, half meatball, and a cheesesteak hoagie.   The pizza just wasn't that good. There was plenty of delicious cheese, as usual, to bring this score up to three stars. But the pizza seemed to be in some weird state of being undercooked in the middle and the edges were perhaps too cooked or chewy. Also, the meatballs were frankly not balls, or even half balls. They were crumbled to pieces and, frankly, gross.   As for the hoagie, I just wasn't impressed. Firstly, it is on the small side, in my opinion, and not toasted. Though I did really appreciate that the used real steak and not steak'ums, it just didn't resemble in taste to that of a good cheesesteak (i.e., Peppi's). It had no saltiness, not enough sauce, and lacked in the gooey cheese department.  All in all, I will probably try Mineo's again, but not for a while. Honestly, if this was the first time I ever had their stuff, I would probably have written them off for good.",

I picked up the order and the staff was great at helping me get it out to the car. The food was delicious! The kids loved the plain cheese pizza and adults loved the pepperoni and white pizzas. The amount of pepperoni was generous; I did request it on top of the cheese. The few guests who couldn't eat pizza loved the arancini with my salad. Both sauces tasted great. Thanks, Mineo's!

We all ate a slice or two with no one commenting on the pizza, until finally, one person said what had been on all of our minds: \"hey, this isn't very good\".  We all agreed, and we didn't even finish the pizza.  Just too much cheese and an overall low-quality taste.

UPDATE: I can't believe I forgot to mention the amazing discovery I had right before I left Pittsburgh - the tiramisu at Mineo's is pretty good. Maybe a little too sweet, but it does not taste like the fridge. At this price, and in this town (sad but True), that's saying a lot. For example, at the famous Dish the desserts taste like the fridge.  Oh, and the ice cream is not exactly quality, but I liked it.

    "text": "I went to Mineo's yesterday in Squirrel Hill. I was on Murray Avenue to get my computer repaired (I'll review that later), and I figured it would be a good chance to try \"the best pizza in Pittsburgh\". I wasn't  terribly impressed. I don't really understand the hype.   The crust is just too thin. Its literally about 1/3cm thick. Like the thickness of stacking two CDs on each other. There's way too much sauce and way too much cheese for the wafer thin crust. Plus its pretty expensive for pizza in Pittsburgh plus they're skimpy on the toppings. I like thin crust. But the crust was so thin the pizza was uneatable without silverware. And since they don't have any silverware, you're forced to eat it with a plastic fork. And since you have to eat it on a paper plate, you end up cutting through the paper and/or eating some of it....the sauce and grease from the pizza seep through the plate.  After we realized that you can't eat the pizza like a normal human, it wasn't that bad. Everything tasted good. The cheese was delicious. I just don't understand the hype.  A medium cheese pizza is like $12.70. We got it half sausage, half mushroom. There was hardly any toppings on the pizza and for some reason, they were all around the outter edge of the pie. We also got a garden salad. The salad's six bucks and its pretty big. There was plenty for myself, my daughter and my friend. I was hoping for some homemade Italian dressing or something special but you just get a packet of Ken's.  Speaking of my daughter...she loved the pizza. 2 year olds don't mind turning into the sloppy, saucy messes that grownups don't usually enjoy. After the pizza cooled off enough for her to eat it...she dived head first into sauce and cheese and paper-thin crust and emerged a sloppy red mess. She told us several times that \"This is good pizza\". So hey, Mineo's...you had at least one fan at our table.  The service was excellent. Everyone was nice and courteous. My only complaint is they're stingy with the plates and the plasticware. Considering the fact that its impossible to eat this pizza without a fork and knife, I find this very odd. And considering the fact that your paper plate will get sippy soppy with grease and sauce and shred itself....I don't know why they don't just hand you a stack of plates an inch high. Or at least get better paper plates.  Final verdict? This is NOT the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Not even close. I really hope the Yinz don't take their out of town friends to this place to show them what \"Pittsburgh pizza is like\", its just going to scare them. In a town with at least a half dozen pizza places within delivery range of every residence...there's at least a hundred pizza shops that serve better pies. The pizza tasted great....but it was structurally unsound. If they put less cheese or made a thicker crust, it might work.  After we ate pizza, we went next door to their little ice cream/beer shop. We ordered a sundae and it was $3.65 and huge! The guy who made it asked me how I wanted it made and I just told him to make a good sundae and the guy did indeed make a good sundae. My daughter loved it, that's for sure. And it was huge....we all got our fill and I took half it home for the next time she's in an ice cream mood.  While I wasn't drinking....the beer shop was well stocked with 6-packs of all sorts of tasty look beverages. I didn't check the prices but I'm sure they're in line with the rest of the city's monopolistic price-schemes.",

I've been in the Bay for almost 5 years and I still haven't found any place I like as much (the person who said Pizza My Heart was better should be committed to a mental institute). Any time I'm back in Pittsburgh I have to stop by for a few slices. As of my review, I'm the 8th person from the Bay Area writing a review, so I guess my experience isn't that unique.  When you walk in Mineo's, you immediately understand your in a classic family pizza parlor. Magazine awards and reviews line every wall. There's pictures of family members at various stages of growth. Tables and tiles with color patterns right out of 1983. And an Italian guy vying for the \"Mario Look-alike\" contest behind the counter tossing a pizza crust. Perfect.  As for the pizza, it's a little messy and a little on the greasy side, which is the only downside. To that end, it's a little bit of a guilty pleasure, but so worth it. A hand-tossed crust, topped with a slightly sweet tomato sauce. Toppings will sometimes be under the cheese which is a unique touch, although I'm not quite sure what the purpose it--but who cares. Cheese is in a thick layer, but quite tasty and flavorful.  Everyone in Pittsburgh has their personal favorite of the pizza places on this block and will defend their choice feverishly. I'm Mineo's through and through.",

I truly hope this is not 'the best pizza in Pittsburgh' like locals claim, because if that's True I'm in for a wold of pizza hurt.  Also, it's a cash only business, and they are down right rude if you ask if they take credit/debit.    This pizza is not any particular style, i.e. NY, pan, Chicago, etc.  It comes with a thicker salty crust with too much bad cheese, and is very very greasy.  It might be more tolerable if the crust had a little cornmeal in it, but it's really bland as it stands now.    Usually every big city has a great pizza place - where, oh where is that place in Pittsburgh?",

Ah well, it's sausage pizza, it happens. But when we arrived home the cheese had migrated to one side of all of the pizzas. The dough itself was soaked through with grease and was severely undercooked. We called and the manager, Ron, told us to bring them back for new ones. He was cordial speaking to my aunt and everything seemed good. Then we arrived and asked for Ron, who promptly told us it was our fault the pizza was a mess, that apparently we neglected to carry the boxes \"straight enough\" and had the gall to drive them home. He continued to insult us, made us look at the pizzas we brought back and told us over and over all the many ways this was our fault, how no pizza left his shop this way, how much pride he took in the pizza, and how he refused to argue with me (while arguing with me).  My cousins and I are young, in our early twenties, and the difference in how Ron treated us compared to when he was speaking with my aunt was shocking. I've managed a coffee shop in the neighborhood and I cannot even imagine treating a customer this way. He continually insulted myself and my cousins, to the point where I begun to raise my voice. I was furious and trying to hold it in, but he just kept going.   We didn't ask for money back; all we wanted was a fresh pizza. Ron decided I needed a lesson on the intricacies of cheese and his oh so delicate pizza. My family has been patronizing this business for over forty years. This will be the last time any of us ever grab so much as a slice. Thanks Ron!",

Mineo's makes very unique pizza; the sauce and dough are unlike any other pizza place, and the amount of cheese on the pizza is insane. It's kind of like a cross between a New York pizza's thin crust with Chicago's love of calories. Lots of people love it, which is why you meet many people in Pittsburgh who will recommend it as the best pizza place in town. Lots of people think it is too greasy or cheesy. You won't know what you think until you try it.  One other note, the prices seem expensive, until you realize that 2 slices of a Mineo's pizza is at least as filling as four slices of regular pizza.",

The sausage comes in crumbles, and tastes like it has to be home made.  Not the manufactured balls or slices you see at other places.  There is plenty of cheese and it has just the right amount of salt.  Although it's a little pricey you definitely get your money's worth.  You will get stuffed from 2-3 slices.  I usually eat half the pie at which point I have trouble breathing but it's worth it.  The best part though is the sauce... it is like crack.  I could drink a bowl of it.  Just writing this is making my mouth water.  Also, they have a large assortment of bottled beer that's reasonably priced.  And there's plenty of seating with a low-key, simple, old-fashioned pizza shop feel to it.  I've been here many times with friends and they all love it too.  I've only eaten in, and that's how I'd recommend eating it... fresh out of the oven.  You will not be disappointed.",

Let me describe it for you: The crust is neither too thick or to thin and is quite flaky and soft. The sauce also is pretty standard, but the difference comes with the cheese and toppings. At Mineos the pepperoni is actually placed under the cheese. And there is not just a couple pieces sporadically tossed over the pie, but instead the entire thing is covered with thick sliced pepperoni. To top it off the cheese is layered on like an inch thick. I've never seen so much cheese on a pizza before. And it is greasy, I'm talking grease ponds pooling on the slices. For my tastes it is great, but i can see why other people don't like it. Have a gallon of water handy after you finish eating. Every time I eat here I am thirsty or hours afterwards. Like most pizza places you either love it or hate it.  A large one topping isn't cheap, something like 20 dollars. But in my opinion well worth the extra 5 dollars to support a local restaurant instead of some chain.",

I wanted Mineo's to be delicious because I live close by but the price and the lackluster flavor was a disappointment.

The cheese they use isn't so tasty either. I'm all about the cheese and it was so bad I ended up taking it off. That's no way to eat a pizza! Next time I will try Aiello's.",

Our favorite of all of them?  Mineos!  It's like loading a shotgun full of delicious cheeses and pulling the trigger.  Their pizza is all around good, but it's primarily a righteous cheese delivery system, and a cheese lovers delight!",

    "text": "We were out Urban Hiking in Pittsburgh and basically got hungry. I was traveling with my hubby, daughter and her boyfriend and we all decided on PIZZA. I went to my trusty <a href=\"http://YELP.COM\">YELP.COM</a> mobile app and did a search on best pizza in Pittsburgh.  To be truthful, his was the second location on the list but the first one to serve BEER...I called them both and this was the winner and to be truthful, I am glad it was...it was delicious.  We parked on a side street to avoid paying for parking. We only had to walk about one city block and cross the main drag to get to the pizza restaurant. We went into the first door of three facing the sidewalk. This was the pizza joint location where you can order by the slice. They grabbed a booth and I walked up to the counter to order. The guy directed me through the doorway to the right and up a step or two because there was NO Beer served in this section. We had to go to the bar area.  The next room was ice cream and bakery, and they directed me through another door to their right and up a few steps. Everything in Pittsburgh is made on the hillsides, so you are constantly going up or down based on where you are going...reminds me of San Francisco.  So we finally made it to the bar area. The waitress guided us to a table near the front window facing the street. She explained due to the cooler weather the large windows were closed but normally would be wide open.  We ordered our drinks of soda, water and beer for Tony. Tony and I opted to share a small pizza supreme made their way without any substitutions. Noel went with an Italian sub sandwich with chips and Adam went with a calzone.  She was gone about 20 minutes but it was worth the wait. The food was amazing. I would definitely eat here again. I was so happy that I had some leftover pizza to take home for dinner. The pricing wasn't bad, I paid $45 for all the food, taxes and tip of $5. We were very pleased and I highly recommend. This of course is my personal opinion, I hope that if you decide to go here that you are happy with your choices also. Can't wait to go here again!!!!",

    "text": "I had a situation in which I couldn't eat most of the day, and picked Mineo's a the place to chow down at the end of the ordeal.  I noticed they have Arancini on their menu and wanted to try them.  I have not seen them anywhere else in the US but ate them all over Sicily.  I wanted to see how they handled them.  They were round, hot, and made with a mix of peas, rice, and ground meat.  They were served with a red sauce that my husband liked but I thought they didn't need any sauce.  Compared to the dozens we ate in Sicily, we thought these were solidly in the middle of the pack--which is a high compliment since food quality is generally much higher in Sicily.  Given the Sicilian theme, I also chose to go with Sicilian pizza.  Very bready pizza like this is not my husband's favorite, but it was a nice change since neither of us had this type in many, many years.  Also we were painfully hungry upon arrival.  I also decided to go with the John's Special since it's our mode to opt for house specialties when available.  This meant that we got sausage, peperoni, green peppers, and onions for toppings.  We thought this was a good value since the individual toppings are pricey.  Even though we were so crazy hungry, we each only managed to eat two pieces of the pizza.  It was a satisfying experience.  We ate the pizza for breakfast the next day, and the next day, and lunch another day, and finally took it to my parents.  At $28 it wound up being a good value...a gift that kept on giving.  And it made dad happy, because he LOVES leftovers that are not his own.  Would I deal with the hassle of the heat and the wait at Mineo's again?  Probably not.  Twice before we set out to eat there and decided we couldn't manage it.  For me, it fit the bill for the specific events of that day.  If I was in Squirrel Hill and wanted pizza, I would just get a slice to go from one of the other shops on Murray.",

The cheese is supreme, not rubbery nor dry. Second, the crust is rich, buttery, and baked to perfection.  And the size. For a large you get 12 slices for $18 that's cheaper than chain pizza places. Plus the atmosphere of the bar next door makes it a great place to eat in.",

If you're a vegetarian I would advise them to separate or not include the meatballs in the same container.   For my ziti (that was actually penne), I had to jazz up the sauce. I added salt, more basil, thyme, and red pepper flakes. I also had the stuffed peppers which needed more flavor as well (mainly salt).   On a positive note - the garlic bread was to die for!!!! I wish they had a separate menu item for these with a side of sauce. Too bad you have to buy a meal to get the bread.",

No, they don't deliver, but that's the badge you earn as a business owner when your food is that good.  You want the best pizza in Pittsburgh?  Then get in your car and drive to Squirrel Hill and pick it up!  Mineo's is covered in cheese, thick, glorious cheese.  The crust is made from the wings of angels and the toppings are fresh and typically hidden within said glorious cheese.  The prices are a little higher for pizza (but of course worth it) and they used to only take cash, but that may have changed.  But again, when you're that good, you make the rules, and I'll gladly follow them.",

If you picked it up all of the toppings just slid off. We also ordered a meatball sub. It was just as bad as the pizza however it hardly had any sauce and only four meatballs on a large sub.....the meatballs had no flavor. In total three of us spent $40 for no service, greasy food, in a very dirty restaurant. We will never return.",

It's a decent sized pizza shop, enough tables for 20 to 30 people and they get you your food pretty quickly. They serve beers as well even though it was rather early for one of those.  I ordered two regular slices while my husband ordered 2 slices topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers. When our order was ready a mere 5 minutes after ordering I noticed that my husband's veggies were completely raw and just sitting on top of the pizza. It's like they took a plain slice, warmed some veggies and just tossed it on top. I'm use to my veggies being incorporated into the cheese. I understand the need for speed and convenience but I don't want to pick my slice up and have all the toppings just fall off.   My slices were hot and cheesy with the shiny gleam of grease floating on top. Not too much but more than I wanted. I have to admit that I wasn't too thrilled about the flavor. It literally just tasted like melted cheese on bread. I could barely taste the sauce which had a sweet after taste that I'm not fond of. The crust was had a good bite too it, not too thick and not too thin but again it lacked flavor.I normally eat the end of the crust if it's good but this crust tasted too much like flower. I ended up only finishing 1 and 1/2 slices and gave the rest to my husband.  I was expecting a little more spices and flavoring in the sauce but this tasted like gas station pizza to me. I probably won't be back here even though they have other items on the menu. Sorry Mineo's: I just wasn't impressed.",

    "text": "Bad service. Ordered a pizza for pickup. Got there and paid, was told it would be a minute. Was told 25 minutes when I ordered it, was probably 20 minutes when I paid. After a half hour of waiting, I walked up to the counter to see what was taking so long. Another guy was being told they screwed up his order and could make his Pizza in 15 minutes. It was the same thing I ordered, so I asked what happened to my Pizza, the employee asked another guy at the oven, he said it's out and pointed to a box sitting there. I asked how long has it been there, said I was standing here for a half hour. The employee handed me the pizza and said sorry, the owner was standing behind me, gave me a dirty look when I was walking out. That probably explains the lousy service. Pizza was ok, but extremely greasy. Not at all what I remembered when I are here before.",

We got 4 plain slices and two sodas for 9 dollars which we felt was pretty cheap.  The pizza is thin crust with lots of cheese.

As a new Pittsburgher, I had no idea how to order or what my seating options were at Mineo's so my husband, friend and I walked up to the counter to order in a room that had booths (but was definitely not a sit down/service booth). We then found out that two doors up is the restaurant section. We asked the counter staff if they could bring the pizza out to us at a table in the restaurant.   When we sat at the restaurant, we were given very little attention, assuming because we'd incorrectly ordered in the other room? The server took a long time to bring us waters, did not ask if we wanted a drink, did not refill our waters, did not check in once our pizza came. The restaurant was not super busy so can only figure the reason was we didn't order through her? Signage in either of the spaces (or even a quick explanation as we were placing our order) would have been very helpful in understanding the process.   Anyway, given all the pizza places in Pittsburgh, we'll likely be trying the rounds before making it a point to come back. I'm sure people who'd been to Mineo's before and knew what to expect love their experience but as a new person to the city and restaurant, was pretty turned off by our experience.",

Toppings are baked under the cheese. A veteran Mineo's man-at-arms knows to wait at least 5 minutes before even thinking about taking a knife + fork to it. If not, enjoy peeling the skin off the roof of your mouth before bedtime. These days their consistency has struggled a bit in my experience, but when they get it right it's like nothing you've had before...mmm, that crust! What's keeping them at 4 stars is that they've expanded again in recent years to offer a small bar and dining room. A nice sleeper option to watch dem Stillers!",

The cheese on a Mineo's pizza is not only abundant, but flavorful (likely a mix of several cheeses including mozzerella and sharp provolone.) The sauce has a strong and spicy flavor. The standard crust is a thinner Neapolitan, but Sicilian is available upon request. Mineo's also serves up a very good chicken wing as well as oven cooked hoagies. All portions are very generous. If you aren't ok with eating a significant amount of cheese then I would not recommend Mineo's, but if you're a cheese lover then this is heaven. Dining in or carrying out the service is always prompt and friendly. Make sure to bring cash as they do not accept debit/credit cards.",

We didn't want to go anywhere too far from Oakland, and it was getting late, so we decided to go here.  We heard rumors of their pizza and a local even stopped us to tell us how good it was saying that it was \"the best\". That combined with my intense hunger I was ravenous to try their pizza. We got a simple small cheese pizza (even though I'm usually a topping kind of girl) and my god. The worst part about a fresh pizza is that you can't help but biting into the pizza too early leaving you with a burnt tongue.   We fought through the pain and let me say, it was amazing. Totally worth the wait, the pizza itself was fine without any toppings due to the amazing quality of the cheese and tomato sauce. Usually pizzerias get the crust wrong, but this was perfectly crispy and wasn't bland at all! The soft melted cheese combined with the crisp crust made for a perfect pizza.   Afterwards we decided to get a cannoli - because, who doesn't enjoy a good cannoli? These where stuffed to the brim with the creamy filling and were freshly made. They wait until the last minute to put the icing in so the shell doesn't get soggy, so no worries there.   TLDR: Pizza good. Cannoli good. Would go again.",

The toppings they bake under the cheese!  wHY?   You don't know when you order your pizza half mushroom half pepperoni what you are getting unless you lift up the pile of cheese!  Also when you get this pizza it is a 12 cut but really all the ingredients are in the middle the pieces on the outside are all crust so really I would say the people who get the outside pieces are just really eating bread!!

While I don't agree it's quite the best, I definitely enjoy the pizza here and I also enjoy it more than its competitor a few doors up the road.   I think what makes Mineo's so good is the really crispy crust, the slightly sweet sauce, and the ooey gooey cheese (which there is a lot of). With so much cheese on the pie, you need a sturdy crust to balance it, which you have with Mineo's. If you dine in, you've got to try the cannolis for dessert! Even if you're anything like me and you're usually not a fan of cannolis, something about the cannolis here might change your mind. The filling is so smooth and has just the right amount of sweetness.   While I've also tried their Mount Lebanon location, I prefer the Squirrel Hill location. The bar at Squirrel Hill is a perfect place to watch a Steelers game and enjoy great pizza. Just remember to bring cash!",

    "text": "I am here at the recommendation of a local. Pizza here is a cross between New York and Chicago. We ordered a large pepperoni for the four of us and it was way too much. We left almost half of it over and had to bring it back to the hotel. Do use about double the amount of cheese on a regular pizza and they use extra thick cut pepperoni which I loved.  The place is a basic walk up and order Pizza place. There is no tableservice here. Because of the amount of cheese  the pizza took about 25 minutes from ordering it. The tables are very small and we couldn't fit two adults and two children with a large pizza in the middle. Everything was hanging off the edges and very difficult to eat which lessened the experience. The pizza itself was very good I would definitely come back for another but likely get it to go. They only have two sizes of pies small or large. I would get the small next time. They also sell it by the slice which looked like a popular option. I normally would've given this place 4 stars but took a star away for the small tables, lack of table service, and indifferent staff.",

When I was younger, there was really no better place to go. Over a span of 10-15 years or so, the pizza was awful. Then came the expansions. With it, the pizza almost returned to its former glory.   That is, until I went there tonight. I sat in the bar section and ordered a beer and a small pizza. The bartender seemed busy and reallt agitated. After 35+ min, it finally came out. It seemed like it took a long time, especially since the couple next to me came in 10 min after me and got their pizza 10 min before I did. It may have been a mistake. Maybe it really takes that long?   I took two bites. It tasted bad. The crust was gummy, the cheese tasted cheap and the sauce was metallic. It was not the thin, sharp cheesy taste I remembered. I literally paid and left and walked up to Aiello's to get slices there. I am yet again feeling disappointed. I want to like it. I used to like it. I don't think I am interested in continuing to try.",

They were tended to immediately & received napkins and silverware. It looks like we were invisible because are older and/or because we didn't have children with us even though the server was older). I had even gone to the bar as soon as we got there just as the sign suggested and they said they would send someone right out. Service is everything when you are paying for food. The pizza is good at Napoli's in Squirrel Hill and the staff are so much friendlier & professional. It's time to stop going to places where they don't care about a satisfied customer. Go to Napoli's instead of Mineo's.",

We call to place our order, it's specifically cash only upon pick up, and a large mushroom pizza is $20.   I've had Mineo's a few times now, and walking into the shop, there have been a bunch of people inside every time. Young adults are visible, working hard in the back, making dough and pounding crust. It does seem to have a house made integrity, and you can taste that in the pizza.   There's a good amount of cheese, they put the toppings underneath the cheese sometimes. I kinda wish there was more sauce. I found the crust on the end to be too crunchy and dried.   Overall, my partner will continues to order plain pizza from this hard working shop. I will eat it and enjoy it just okay, wishing they gave out little packets of red pepper and parm.",

    "text": "I have brought my family to Murray hill for years for pizza.  I have introduced dozens of families to Aiello's and Mineo's over the years.  I believe Aiello's has the best white pizza and believed Mineo's had the best red pizza in the burgh.    Today will be the last time we EVER eat Mineo's.    While sitting waiting for Mineo's pizza my two young daughters were eating two slices of Aiello's pizza outside the store while waiting for our Mineo's pizza to be cooked.  This is the part I can't make up - the owner came out of the store, stood in front of us for 15 sec. and stared down my 14 year old daughter to ask where she bought her slice.  When she replied meekly \"Aiello's\" - he demanded that \"we leave his establishment, and eat it in front of that place of business\".     IN SHOCK- I stepped in to explain that My family drove all the way from robinson twp and that I also ordered an entire pizza from his store to compare the two pizzas as I had done dozens of times before.  At this point, he tried to change his tune.  It might have been ok, but he went on to call Aiello's (who passed away last year), an \"evil, despicable person who stole from his family for years\".    My wife, obviously offended, tried to cancel our order, but (I cant make this up either) instead of apologizing, the owner refused to cancel our order.  Truly sad that a grown man with an apparent vendetta from a decade ago would treat a customer, let alone a 14 year old girl like that.  Please take your business elsewhere...a decent slice of pizza is not worth supporting this establishment.",

I like fresh sourdough dough, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh homemade tomato sauce. You know, the trendy hipster pizza that has been taking over the world....  This pizza is exactly what you would expect for a joint that opened 50 years ago, or whenever it opened. It's loaded with mozzarella cheese, sauce is decent, covered in grease. It reminds me of when I was a kid and I would melt cheese in a bowl and shove it in my mouth. The cheese is thick and rubbery and you couldn't ask for more. It's a very satisfying pizza. It would be great if there were little Parmesan shakers of cheese at the restaurant. Overall, it's great but if I want a pizza from the 70s, I'd probably choose fiores..",

    "text": "Best pie on the planet!    The reviews that claim it's more nostalgic than anything and if you don't know \"real\" pizza... blah blah blah.  I've traveled the world and have had \"pizza\" all over the globe, including Rome (which doesn't even use much cheese unless you go for a cheesy pizza).  Nostalgic?  Absolutely!!  But, I've had NY pizza and like it very much too, but it is no Mineo's, it is a skinny delicate thing that NEEDS to be folded or you'll chip your teeth before you hit substance.    You simply can not fold Mineo's, it's too rich full of goodies.  It'd be like complaining that you can't fold a lasagne.    It is a cross between a Chicago deep dish and a New York thin pizza.    I had an old GF from that area that used to put 15 or so napkins on top of the freshly made pie to sop up the oily juice. LOL    It is a hard pie to pick up since it has so much cheese, sauce and fillings.  What makes the place amazing for me is the pepperoni pizza.  The pepperonis are so pepper filled and spicy and overly abundant, under the cheese, that the spicyness  becomes a part of the slice, instead of simply on top of it.  I live in Lauderdale now, but maybe the pizza is so rich because, yes, they do grow us bigger there and it is colder, so a rich meal sustains us throughout the winter.  (summer too. LOL)  If you love their pies then you do.  If it is too much for you, then go for the dainty NY skinny stuff.  Pizza is a name, not a recipe, other than it's round.  Oh yeah, some are square.

    "text": "Ordered takeout from here the day before we moved out of town - so we had no chairs in our apartment, and needed something we could eat quickly, standing up against a counter.  PIzza made the most sense!  Since Mineo's is a classic Pittsburgh pizza joint, we thought we should finally check it out.  I trudged over in the snow to pick up our pizzas, which were about $20 each for a large with 1-2 toppings.  The counter staff was extremely friendly and gave me all the extra plates and silverware I needed because ours was all packed.  I carried them back to our apartment where we opened them up, and saw that the cheese had sort of....swirled around messily in the center of the pizzas.  As if the cheese wasn't firmly attached to the crust, but sort of a loose, amorphous being with a mind of its own.  I immediately started apologizing, fearing that I had tilted the pizzas while I was carrying them, but then one of our friends said \"No, that's how it always is from Mineo's.\"  Um, okay.  Kind of weird, but at least it wasn't my fault!  The pizza was tasty, but very messy.  It didn't really stay uniform and attached, with globs of cheese sliding off the crust into the middle of the box.  People would pull out a slice and suddenly realize they only had crust and sauce because everything else was gone.  It's like there's too much cheese for such a thin crust, it can't support the weight!  So it was definitely knife and fork pizza, but it was decent-tasting.  Pretty standard.  But I have to say - GROSSLY overpriced for what you get.  And thus the two stars.  If this pizza was like...$7 less per pie, I'd give it 3 stars.  But seriously - it's just ridiculous.  It really was totally average, but they charge you like it's made of gold.   I truly do not understand what makes this such a lauded pizza place.",

The quality of the ingredients is one of the most important things in food, and when it comes to pizza (where a basic cheese pizza has only a few), the lack of quality ingredients stands out, as it does here.  In addition, I am not of the mindset that greater quantity=better food.  They really put a ton of cheese on their pizza, and it ends up being an even greasier mess than a usual pizza.  Waaay too much cheese for me.  If you are from a city with great pizza, don't believe the hype about this place.",

Without having it from before I still kind of get that vibe. It seems like Mineo's makes some okay pizza but mostly rides on the fame it built up from its past.  The store is small but you don't really dilly dally so it looks like you can usually find a spot before your pizza is done. We did. I ordered a large pepperoni and sausage and received a pepperoni and mushroom. My girlfriend hates mushrooms but the place was so busy we didn't feel like ordering a new pizza so she picked them off. The crust is \"okay\". It seems like it's trying to be authentic but was kind of on the dry side. In my opinion a good pizza crust should be crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.  The ingredients were top notch. The mushrooms were good quality and so was the pepperoni. The pepperoni had the full flavor of a True pepperoni. Not that spicy greasy mixture you get from the store or from most pizza places. The cheese was really good and was slightly browned which is cooked better than most places but still not \"ideal\". The cheese should just be plain dark in some spots. Pizza should be cooked at high heat so give it the texture it was meant to have. However, it still kicks the butt of most places in the city.  The once great Mineo's is still great because it's become almost a cultural landmark of Pittsburgh. It's a shame they seem to cut a few corners because it truly is the makings of a great pizza.",

There are a lot of other pizza shops in Squirrel Hill and my personal preference is Aiello's.  Plus I want to try Lucci's.  That said, the pizza here is still good.  It's just that they bury everything under mounds of cheese here.  If you don't like your pizza so cheesy, then this place is not for you.  We decided to hang out in the neighborhood Saturday Night.  Y'know, pizza and then a movie at the Manor.  We ordered ours with pepperoni, onions, and black olives.  Not too bad, but I get very full after just a couple of slices.    They've got sandwiches here.  Maybe one of these days I'll stop in and get me one.",

    "text": "Decent pizza. As far as the whole Mineo's vs Aiello's, I don't have a preference which is why I rated them the same. In my opinion, Aiello's sauce is slightly peppery for my taste, but Mineo's is slightly greasy for my taste.  Back to just Mineo's...if you like greasy pizza then you will probably like this place. I don't mind a little, but I literally have to use 3-4 napkins per slice just to blot the grease down to a minimum. As far as customer service, these guys have been constantly grumpy and short-tempered every time I had gone in the past.   So if you want pizza in Sq. Hill, like greasy pizza and don't mind dealing with pissy employees, then try it out. If you don't like either of these things, I wouldn't waste your time.",

The toppings are placed under the piles of cheese they put on the pizza (there is no need to order extra cheese like you would have to at other establishments).  The crust is a yellow dough and is very good.  It's a unique taste - they make their own dough, sauce, and cheese mix.  Parking is street parking and can be challenging at times.",

Normally, I roll my eyes when people blot their pizza--what's pizza without some grease?--but Mineo's slices are an exception.   The sauce here is pretty good, but as is the case with the cheese, there's too much of it.  I've burned my finger holding down the cheese as I bite into my slice so I don't end up pulling off all of it.  I thought the crust leaned towards being a little too crispy.  I like the paneled walls and the framed photos--check out the Life magazine cover of young Molly Ringwald.  But I don't come to a pizza place for ambiance, so it's not enough to keep me from looking at other places for a superior slice.",

    "text": "I have been continually disappointed by Mineo's ice cream. For somewhere between $3-4 (I forget the exact prices) you can get a \"double\" scoop that is about the size of a very small single scoop at any other ice cream shop. The second \"scoop\" isn't even a ball of ice cream, it's basically a sliver. For somewhere between $2-3 you can get a \"single\" scoop that is smaller than a typical kids cone, with the ice cream barely filling the cone. Every time I've gone the cone has been cracked/broken making for a very precarious ice cream situation. The ice cream itself is delicious, which is why I am giving a 2 star review instead of a 1 star. I have been multiple times this summer because we live so close and was hoping that it was just a mistake the first time I got a cone that small. But it's happened now three times. When I asked the scooper today, she said they were instructed to make them that small. We will be going elsewhere for our ice cream. We may have to drive to Oakland to Dave and Andy's, but at least we will get our money's worth with a cone that is actually a normal size.",

Since the person who bought it did carry-out, I guess one can take this review with a grain of salt, seeing as I have no idea how long the pizza took to make, how long it sat out, etc.   The options were Hawaiian, cheese, and pepperoni, which was really more like a cheese pizza with the occasional pepperoni in the proverbial haystack. The crust was just so thick, and it seemed like the whole thing was just cheese and bread. This made it taste relatively good within the first five minutes of eating, but eventually turned into a force feeding-I had read such fantastic reviews about the pizza, so I wanted to like it.  The saving grace was probably the sauce-I'm a fan of the sweet stuff, so it was exactly how I liked it.",

Sauce is sub par- but not bad. cheese has a good taste- but no surprise here TOO MUCH- always too cheesy in this part of the country. I guess just lots of big folks who like to fill up on two slices.

I want to put up a separate listing, but I can't find anything to indicate that the ice cream parlor has a different street number.   After eating at Ka Mei, we both wanted dessert. The sign above the door, one that screams \"independent,\" beckoned us.  Wouldn't ya know they use Edy's ice cream and bring in their other desserts (pies, cakes, tortes, oh my!) from outside bakeries?  So I ordered a caramel apple pie with vanilla ice cream. The pie was tall, full of apples, and was heated in an actual oven instead of a microwave. It satiated my sweet tooth, but a visit to a supermarket could have gotten me the same thing, y'know? I mean, ya buy a pie, a pint of ice cream, you're all set. Is it that hard to bake your own pies and make your own ice cream? Why bother with storebought stuff, even if it's pretty decent?   P.S. I didn't try the pizza but can't imagine it differs much from the underwhelming (in my opinion) Mt. Lebanon Mineo's.",

The cheese was laid on a bit thick for my tastes, but other than that it was pretty delicious.  I really didn't see what was terribly remarkable about it, though.

    "text": "How have I not reviewed Mineo's yet?   This place is a short walk and an easy \"what do we have for dinner\" solution, so we come here quite a lot and sit at the bar.   9 times out of 10, we have drinks and pizza by the slice.   Drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good happy hour as well.     Funny story - I met the owner as a guest at a Steelers game years ago.  He asked if we were Mineo's or Aiello's people and I said \"Neither - Mineo's has the superior product, but they ruin it with way too much cheese.\"   Too much cheese...you ask?   Yes, there is such a thing (and that's a big statement from me because I love cheese).  His response to my comment?   Well, why don't you just ask for light cheese?  Uh...cause I'm an idiot and never thought of that.     Fast forward a bit, I am firmly in the Mineo's camp.  Pizza by the slice is reasonably priced and tasty.  The crust is awesome dipped in their homemade ranch dressing.  By the slice still sometimes has too much cheese, but not often.  If I'm ordering a whole pie, I definitely go light (which is really still more than a normal amount of cheese).  If you watch them make it at the counter, they really pile it on.     4 stars instead of 5 because they don't take cash and they don't do delivery.   I could live without the delivery, but the cash thing is just plain annoying (yes...even though they have an ATM on site).",

    "text": "Absolutely the best pizza in Pittsburgh, and quite possibly the world. I've tried pizza in NY, LA, NJ, Venice, and many more places. Nothing compares to the powerhouse of a pizza that is Mineo's. Perfect cheese, crust, and sauce. It really has it all. Disregard any negative reviewers on the grounds of stupidity: If you troglodytes don't like cheese, why are you eating pizza? Get breadsticks or some terrible $5 ready-made garbage that I'm sure you ungrateful dolts probably prefer. If you want a REAL pizza, heavy with high quality cheese and ingredients, look no further than Mineo's. The other local \"competitors\" can't hold a candle to Mineo's. I've proudly been eating at Mineo's for about 20 years, and I would continue overnighting their pizza anywhere if I were ever to move out of Pittsburgh. It's that good.   Update:  It's absolutely ridiculous that someone suggested that you'd get a much better pizza at Dinette. Paul, you're confused. You say Mineo's is just a typical pizza, which is absurd. Dinette pizza is just a dry and generic neapolitan style pizza, very typical and boring. To give Mineo's 3/5 stars or less should be a crime. Fox's and other garbage pizza establishments have similar reviews. Please be honest with yourself and others. Anything less than a 4 for a pizza lover cannot be taken seriously.",

    "text": "Is this the best pizza EVER, worthy of hours-long drives and a \"must stop\" for out-of-towners? I don't think so. But might it be the best pizza in Pittsburgh, the land of lackluster pizza? Quite possibly.   Despite the fact that I used to live in Squirrel Hill, I hadn't tried this famous pizza until recently. We were in the neighborhood and decided to pick up a pie. Fortunately, we happened to be carrying cash that day (which rarely is the case), as we discovered upon arrival that they're cash-only. I still can't believe cash-only businesses still exist in 2017...but I digress. We ordered the sicilian-style pizza (of which there is only one size...the humongous, \"you'll-hate-yourself tomorrow\" special) and it was ready in about 20 minutes. Just picking up the box made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into....I swear the pizza felt like it weighed about 10 lbs! Pro tip: If you're taking it back to your house in your car, be careful about where you put the box....ours was leaking oil, which luckily I noticed before it stained our back seat.  When we got this monstrosity home, we opened the box and suddenly I understood why the box felt like an anchor and was leaking oil....there was SO. MUCH. CHEESE. If you're a cheese lover, you'll like this pizza. The crust was super thick (as it should be on a sicilian-style), but not tough....it was soft and chewy and held up to all of that cheese well. I also thought their pizza sauce was top notch....it  balanced sweetness and acidity perfectly and tasted fresh. Overall, it was a really delicious pie, and it makes me want to go back to try their regular thin crust pizza. There are a lot of pizza places in the 'Burgh that I haven't been to, so it's hard to say unequivocally that this is the best Pittsburgh pizza, but it's certainly the best I've had so far. I can see why it's been historically loved among the locals. I'll definitely be back!",

Each bay has its own entrance and characteristics. The first is for carry-out orders at a counter, though there is some seating. The middle is desserts, ice cream, cheesecake, cannoli and tiramisu. The third is the main dining area with a full bar and television screens.   We sat in the third area for table service. Mineo's was crowded and we needed to wait a while for a table to clear. Then we had to pounce on it before another party, just coming in the door, could take it! Mineo's has traditional thin crust pizza as well as deep-dish \"Sicilian\" pizza. Julia and Frank waned deep dish. So, we ordered a John's Special with pepperoni, mushroom, onions, green pepper and sausage toppings. A tossed salad to start. (The salad arrives in a large bowl to be shared.) The pizza took a long time to arrive, but it was delicious! It is served in a rectangular shape. I could only manage one slice before I had reached my limit. Our millenials had more, but there was still plenty for them to take home for later.  I definitely want to return, but think I would prefer to try the thin crust pizza.",

We discovered this place back in 2008 while staying at the airport Hilton, on recommendation by the concierge. I had never eaten so much as a slice while in Pittsburgh prior to that, and we ordered a pepperoni pie to share right there. It was, and still is, my absolute favorite pizza of all time from that moment on. I've just never had those flavors replicated anywhere else, and wouldn't change a thing about the sauce, crust, or especially the cheese. In my opinion, this beats the best that New York or Chicago has to offer, and is the underrated gold standard of American pizza. What more can I say?

And I don't get anything else.  The fact that it's cash only is a downer, but not enough to drop it from 5 stars.  Seriously, if you like cheesy pizza, you can not find a better place than Mineos.",

Cheese is the focus here. When our pepperoni pizza was ready, we picked it up and looked at it. Ummmm, where's the pepperoni? Well, it's hidden under approximately five pounds of cheese.  The ingredients are all great. The pepperoni appears to be fresh and hand-cut thick. The cheese had plenty of flavor. The crust was a bit on the soggy side, but good. The sauce did it's job nicely.  I guess my complaint was the balance of the ingredients. SImply put, it was just too cheesy for my tastes. It feel like a ton of lead in your stomach, which may be exactly what some people crave.   In the end, I was glad I went. I liked the pizza. But, there's no way I'd ever go back. It's just too heavy for me.",

    "text": "I sort of feel my heart breaking writing this review. The hype and love for Mineo's Pizza is stuff of Pittsburgh legend. I know not all pizza is for everyone, I personally am a fan of a style of pizza many people hate: thin flakey pastry crust with sweet sauce, but these sounded like straight forward delicious quintessential Pittsburgh pizza.  Having a car is truly expanding my pizza horizons in this city. Branching out to neighborhoods and pizzerias outside of delivery and walking range is amazing. One evening we decided to finally experience the mythical Mineo's.   I called ahead and the girl who answered the phone was polite, informative, and quick. I always like to try a plain Jane cheese pizza to truly test a pizzeria. A large plain cheese pizza was $17. I was floored. That's more expensive then a specialty large or extra large at most other places. I still placed the order, as by this point I needed to know.  The boyfriend dropped me off and I ran in to get the pizza. The interior reminds me of a pizza place I loved in my youth. Orange booths. Wooden walls. Dark interior. The smell of the pizza was UNREAL good. I actually found myself salivating. The employees were friendly and I was in and out in no time.  Once home we sat down to assess this masterpiece we'd purchased. A fluffy crust, almost too much cheese (which is hard for me to say because I love cheese), nicely browned. It looked great. Upon tasting though, I couldn't believe it; so salty. It was overpowering and seemed to be coming from the cheese itself not the sauce. In all it wasn't a bad pizza, and the second day was much better than fresh which isn't really a good thing (no matter how much I love what the boyfriend and I call \"tomorrow slices\").   I may stop in for a slice here and there if I'm in the area, but I don't think I'd ever pay those prices for a whole pizza again. I don't think Mineo's lives up the the hype.",

I initially set out to get something to eat then it turned into a Jerry's run (I lost the three dollars change he gave me. LOL) and as I was approaching Jerry's I saw someone walk down Murray Ave with awesome smelling pizza. I went up Murray Ave after I got my vinyl fix and found Mineo's. I ordered two slices with mushrooms and bacon and it was, so far, the best pizza I have ever had and that's saying something, as Harrisburg had Mama's on 2nd Street downtown.  I noticed all the accolades on the wall near where I was sitting and they were all older but I am sure well deserved. Someone here said that it was much better a long time ago though I wasn't here so I can't compare it. 4 stars because I have not been through the entire city and apparently there is 1,000+ pizza joints in this town. Can't say it's the best as I have only eaten at two joints. Best as of today though!",

The slices were ready pretty quickly and we grabbed some napkins and sat down to eat. We grabbed some red pepper flakes but did not see any parmasean out. The pizza was decent but definitely not as good as I remember. The cheese all just slides off the crust in a solid piece. Maybe it was an off night or maybe Mineo's has gone down hill.

My faith in pizza has been renewed.   We ordered a classic pie with mushroom and pepper. I love the huge amount of cheese - the pizza is actually pretty difficult to consume because of the massive hot cheese layer sliding around on top. The sauce was minimal and not too sweet. The crust's flavor wasn't remarkable, but I thought the thickness and texture were perfect. Nice and chewy and not too thick. Mushrooms were a little weird - I think they were canned?   The restaurant is very big and has multiple seating areas - we ordered and ate in the counter service area. Pretty classic family pizza joint vibes, all the paraphernalia on the walls and what not. Will be my go to spot for no frills, classic pizza in the area.",

Food is cheap and good. Drinks are about average priced, but they do happy hour two times a day during the week (one like 5-6 and one at like 9-10) so lots of opportunity for discounts.   If you're going to eat here, get the Sicilian pizza. It's fantastic! I may have eaten traditional pizza once from here, I just love Sicilian so much. I would recommend against adding a lot of toppings. While I'm a big lover of veggie pizzas, I think that their pizzas should be eat as cheese or cheese + one other topping to not detract from the flavors.   My friends and I usually go together and sit at the bar. Beers are about $5 a pint. I always get rosemary fries (with extra ranch because their ranch is AMAZING here), and 1 slice of Sicilian (because it's a HUGE slice).  It's a good vibe. Open late, relaxed, big tv's so you can watch any game on, just a great place to be in squirrel hill.",

The regular pizza, yeah, ok, 3.5 stars makes sense because the sauce and the cheese separate when you eat it and it all falls apart. Could be solved by putting more cheese closer to the crust so it doesn't slide off when you bite it but I digress. The white pizza. So good. Best white pizza in Pittsburgh.

Instead I had the chicken parm with ziti and a house salad and garlic bread. It is basically a pizzeria so you order up front and then sit and wait to be called. The salad was pretty good as well as the garlic bread. Th Chicken parm was just ok a bit dry and did not thrill me at all. The chicken parm was just not that good. I would not go back to Mineo's for a regular diner. However I will be going back to try the pizza as it does seem to get rave reviews. If I go back i will update my review and let everyone know how the pizza is. The staff where friendly and the service was fast. Unfortunately from this experience i can not give them more than 3 stars as the food was not that great.",

Having grown up near this area I thought that I knew what to expect.  I ordered one of my favorite standard menu items - an Italian hoagie toasted with house dressing. My partner ordered a calzone. We waited for a while and the calzone came out first. When the hoagie came out the bread was toasted so hard that I couldn't bite it. It was literally like a brick. I don't return food to the kitchen often but I had no choice. The hoagie that they served was not edible.  Did the kitchen remake the hoagie? No. They scraped the insides out and put them on a new bun that was not warmed or toasted at all. That is not acceptable at all - terrible terrible service. I was shocked because I have heard so many good things about this place. I just ate part of it and shut up because it was obvious that the people working there didn't care. There are signs decorating the walls of this restaurant saying that they have been in business for 50 years and my question is - how has this place been in business for that long? It's a mystery. I would never go back.",

I recently moved back to the 'Burgh with my wife (who was convinced she knew her favorite pizza from Colorado) and for nostalgia's sake I ordered the pepperoni & mushroom w/ extra cheese. The brilliance of this place is in their pies (if you just want a slice head up street) but their full-size 'large' pie is the best tasting pizza as well as a great value (would be an XXL at any chain) and holds up in the fridge for days. It's cash only so be prepared, ATM on site and they sell single beers, 6-pk's & all kinds of other foods (cannoli is fresh filled and also delicious).   My wife has never mentioned any desire to try any other pizza joint since. I'm sitting here waiting to pick up another one and my mouth's practically watering. Also, be sure you call the right location. They're cool about it, don't get me wrong, but it sucks for them (and for you when you find out your hot delicious pizza is in Mt. Lebanon if you're in Sq. Hill, and vice versa.)  Try it. Don't look back.",

Gluttony at its finest.  The second time, returning from a weekend backpacking trip, thinking, \"what would be the most satiating, comforting food spot that we can stop at after physical exhaustion and a diet composed of freeze-dried foods for days?\"  Our mutual decision without much discussion:  Mineo's, and it was the right decision, and it was the right decision...

I had somewhat high hopes because so many people rave about it, but as I have learned, people in Pittsburgh don't really know food.  We ordered two small pizzas. 1 Pepperoni and 1 sausage and mushroom.   Let's start with the pepperoni.  The pepperoni had a decent flavor and the cheese wasn't bad but overall the pizza lacked flavor.   As for the sausage and mushroom, what a mess.  The sausage was hands down disgusting.  It tasted like bob evans breakfast sausage that had been boiled. No flavor  or texture.  The mushrooms were slimy and gross straight out of a can.  My biggest complaints lie in the sauce and construction.  The sauce was bland and flavorless.  No acidic pop or sweetness to speak of.  Also both pizzas were impossible to eat.  All of the toppings slid off because of the moronic sauce, meat. cheese construction.  Pizza is a handheld event. If you have to use a fork, someone screwed up.  I am not sure what else to say other than I could have gotten a better pizza at a chain anywhere in Pittsburgh.",

Though Mineo's does not take the definitive title (yet), the no-frills atmosphere, down-to-earth waitstaff, and absolutely heavenly pizza makes Mineo's a must-visit.  Dominic, one of the co-owners, suggested his own recipe-- sausage, onion, bacon, and roasted red pepper.  It was unreal!!! Add to that their signature rice balls, a few craft beers, and some good conversation, and you have one hell of a weekend night.  Highly recommended!!!",

I dont mind driving 40 minutes to get it. We get several toppings with extra cheese and it is a heavy pie. Its $27 bucks and worth every dollar.",

    "text": "Ok , I finally made it out to Squirrel Hill , I had to pay Mineo's a visit.  Man , I missed This Pizza !  It is still one of my all time favorites. I ordered a large cheese pizza to go , and they told me 20 min. Well after 45 min , My Pie was finally done. Seems like a really long time to make a pizza , but honestly , after getting home and taking my first bite , all was forgiven. I did get to see a few other places on Murray & Forbes that I gotta try soon.  I wanted to go to Jerry's records & a electronic repair shop , but they were closed at 8:00. Maybe next time I order a Pizza from Mineos , I'll use the 45 min. to buy some old records. ( If I can find my old record player.)",

I had it delivered, so maybe that's where I went wrong, but overall it was still pretty bad. The flavor was good and I liked how they put the toppings below the cheese. On each slice though there was about 1/3 of inch of cheese, while the dough was barely existent. Just too much cheese. Also, it seems to be a Pittsburgh practice to not cook a pizza through, and Mineo's followed suit. So the thick cheese and soft dough kind of had the same consistency. Just not good pizza. And not to sound arrogant, but I'm from NY, and I might have a high bar for good pizza. Still though, I've had better pizza than this in Pittsburgh.",

Not to worry, they were all burried in the heaps of cheese on this wonderful pie.  The pepperoni was a little on the salty side, but quite tasty.  While it is expensive, it's very filling too!  I could normally eat half a large to myself easy.  I bring over one of these pies, and there's still leftovers between the three of us (hungry guys mind you)",

Parking / minimal street parking.. it was freezing so we were trying to avoid walking far but we didn't luck out with on street parking.. we used the metered parking lot 2ish streets down.

And of course to survive on Murray Ave is impressive since that place is a Foodie paradise with so many places to choose from.   Walking in the door over the weekend my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. We grabbed 2 seats at the large bar and immediately dug into the drink menu. The beer selection was pretty nice, but for a pizza place it was expensive. I didn't want to spend $7-9 on a beer so I got the cheapest, a $5.50 Yuengling draft.   But then came the pizza. A thin dough that had a satisfying crunch, decked with my favorite veggie toppings: green peppers and onions. There was really the perfect balance of toppings and they were so fresh. You could tell That nothing about this pizza came from a can.   They sell by the slice which is always a nice bonus, although eating a whole pie wasn't exactly a chore. I don't know when I'll make it back to Mineos, but I can definitely say it is one of the best pizzas on the East End.   If freshness is your main focus, and if you like a thinner crust pizza this may just be the place for you. The only knock on this place is those beer prices, but that's the price of eating in a nice neighborhood perhaps.",

I generally dislike pizzas that are loaded down with toppings, but it wasn't a deal-breaker in this case because the cheese and sauce were tasty.  The crust was the best part of the whole pizza, with decent flavor and a good crumb.  Service was great and friendly as well.

Why, you ask? Well, for starters, I love the generous portions of cheese, which isn't artificial tasting in the least and doesn't gum up in certain sections of the slice. The tomato sauce is among the best I've ever had and the pepperoni is the perfect spice for my tastes. The crusts are garlic buttery and not too doughy which is perfect, and it really isn't that greasy for a pizza. Overall, I'm a Mineo's loyalist and can't wait to go back.",

Shortly thereafter I noticed that my pants had splattered oil across the front and I pulled over to further inspect the situation. Needless to say the oil was all over the floor mat as well. Totally confused I called to share my unexpected story. Mineo's was polite on the phone and said the owner would call me - yet here we are several days later and no follow up. I'm busy too and all that said the purpose of my post is to make others aware that they should inspect their boxes and wear rain suits before exiting the premises. #notHalfBaked #lineYourBoxes #ruinedShirtNjeans",

While I've been coming here since I was a kid, the bar/table service dining room is a relatively new addition. The bar itself pretty big, taking up most of the new space, with comfortable stools and nice decor.   They have a good happy hour from 5 to 6:30, seven days a week. Love that. Plus, their drink prices are reasonable to start with. Both Dale's Pale Ale and Brooklyn Brown were $5 regular price. And what goes better with Mineo's perfect pizza than a cold beer?  Finally, the service is great. Elissa has waited on us the 5 or so times we've visited, and she is friendly and attentive. I heard from another customer that she makes Pittsburgh's best Long Island, but I haven't tried one yet to confirm. Something to look forward to for inevitable future visits.",

I normally just get cheese pizza; it's so good it doesn't even need toppings. The crust is flaky and thin and the sauce is good!

Perhaps all the hype set the standards to high in my head before I tried it.    The staff was very friendly--no complaints there.  The biggest drawback for me is that the the place is cash only--even with tabs over $10 (the standard minimum at most bars I've been to).",

This place was so well known in the area that we wanted to give it a go while in town. Bad idea. Tasted like my high school cafeteria pizza with an overload of cheese. I love cheese, but this was too much.   Pittsburgh, if this is the best you've got for pizza, I feel bad for you. Come to Buffalo and you'll change your mind!",

    "text": "My first adventure when visiting Pittsburgh was to decide for myself who had the best pizza in town - Mineo's or Aiello's. There's long been a debate between the two local pizzerias, located only a block or so from each other. I ordered one slice of pepperoni to go, headed to Aiello's and did the same, settled in at a bistro table along Murray Ave. and prepared my test slices. There is an obvious difference in the look of the slices and my first guess, based on appearance as best slice, went to Aiello's. But in all reality, looks don't matter so I dug in. The verdict? Mineo's wins hands down (on the right in my picture). I don't know if it was the extra grease or the loads of cheese or the sauce, but it was so so yummy. And hot!  I visited the original Mineo's location in Squirrel Hill, which is currently owned by brothers Dominic and John Mineo. Their father and store founder, Giovanni, passed away. The interior is small and modest but the walls are plastered with awards. Many naming Mineo's as the best in the city year after year. The brothers haven't changed a thing, using the same recipe their father crafted in 1958.  It did take a minute for someone to come help me and while the girl who took my order was a doll, the guys behind the counters seemed irritable.  Oh, it's also cash only!   In addition to making dough daily, Mineo's also makes its own sauce and grates its own cheese.",

I will say the pizza sauce had a great peppery flavor and the cheese was creamy and bold, but the service and environment was subpar at best. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, but the attitudes of every person we interacted with were just above the mark of rude. The environment reflects your local pizza joint, nothing fancy and is exactly what you would expect, but the smell was what I couldn't stand. It smelled like bathroom air freshener, which was hard to get over since you're standing in one of the most famous pizza places in the city. I expected to inhale the scent of delicious melted cheese with greasy pepperoni and a perfectly toasted crust, but was met with a Porta-Potty fragrance. The food was pretty tasty, but I recommend getting it to go so that you don't have to interact with the staff.",

Pizza is my favorite food and so this review is critical of everything.   In Pittsburgh, there is no better Pizza as of right now. I don't know about the saddle these 3 star reviews ride on but my 5 should help off-set any overly critical reviews. The pizza is great. Yes, greasy. Yes, heavily cheesy. Crust, crunchy. Toppings average. But it is everything you want. This is a saltier pizza with a tasty homemade herb tomato sauce, all cooked the way you want it. The takeout boxes were recently upgraded which was easily the biggest negative (it used to burn your hands as you held it and sagged in the middle.  They have good sides and what not but that isn't what you go here for. I go here for a appetizer of plain, a main course of onion and mushroom and a delectable pepperoni desert.  Oh by the way, if you really want desert, Mineos is connected to and owns the desert and Ice Cream Parlor next door; walk through the middle, no need to leave.  Meanwhile these people gave it a 3 star review? pssh. So what about a beverage? Pop? you got it. Soda? maybe somewhere else (but really, you got it). BEER? BEER HERE my friends. Quite a nice selection of local and imported beers available by the bottle at the pizza parlor. Want more? they have six packs. Don't want it in a bottle, you prefer tap? Mineo's owns the bar two doors down from the original, next to the ice cream parlor you can get your favorites on tap there and catch the game whilst enjoying a slice of my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  To me, this place is JUST RIGHT.   P.s- Don't hold it to your silly New York pizza standards. Its great pizza. Not claiming to be the best pizza in all of the milky way.",

We opted for the traditional crust which is not a lot of bottom crust but the perfect edge finish.  Perfectly flavored sauce and generous toppings.   Hubs had the hot sausage hoagie which was very large on the bread, small on the sausage and so much sauce that it couldn't be picked up. He also got an order of fries that were huge, crisp and very good.  We would definitely go back for the fabulous pizza, but probably wouldn't try anything else.

Thus, my visit gave me the opportunity to retry and review this legendary pie.  I ordered two plain cheese slices ($3.40), which only took about 5 min. to warm up. Upon biting into them, they seemed promising due to the generous helping of cheese and crispy crust (my personal pizza hangup). However, upon tasting the flavors, I was let down. This is one of the blandest pizzas I've ever tasted--the sauce was nearly flavorless, and the crust tasted like cardboard and had an odd texture (definitely not thin, but not really pan style, either).  The only flavor I clearly tasted was the cheese, which was accompanied by a greasy aftertaste.  Even the addition of oregano and garlic powder did little to increase the complexity of the flavors.  How disappointing!  While the price and service were right, unfortunately, the pizza failed to measure up--esp. in light of my past experience, not to mention the numerous awards Mineo's has won over the years.  Based on those factors and some of the other Yelp reviews, it seems that Mineo's has gone downhill.  At any rate, I'll stick to Aiello's for the time being, and will keep searching for the magic perfect pie-in-the-sky pizza in Sq. Hill.",

The garlic bread is no bueno and should be replaced by garlicky oily garlic knots but who cares, this place is for pizza. Beware, cash only so come prepared.",

    "text": "Was on a business trip in Pittsburgh and decided to explore some good places in the area. Our uber driver recommended this place and told us that it is the best pizza place and a must stop in Pittsburgh so we decided to give it a try.  Food - We ordered pizza by slice. I ordered 1 slice of traditional pizza with toppings and one with just cheese (lots of cheese) and my co workers got the Sicilian style with a few toppings. The pizza looked average and taste was not that great at all! We were expecting something really good after reading so many Yelp reviews and so much praise of this place from our driver but we were highly disappointed. I would say that I would definitely not come back here if I want a good pizza. A home made pizza tastes better than this!  Drinks- We ordered wine,beer and whiskey; they don't have a big wine selection but a lot of beer options just like an average bar so not bad in that respect.   Overall comments- The place isn't too big, the ambience is okay just like any other bar, they have a few tables outside that covers the side walk so I would say it's not too comfortable to sit when other people are walking past you continuously. The service was okay, there was only one person serving 3 tables and a few people sitting at the bar so it was very slow and you had to get up or call him if you need something. The worst part is that the place is CASH ONLY! So make sure you have cash in your pocket if you go there, otherwise there is an ATM nearby (in case). Conclusion - Not recommended by me!  Cheers and live,laugh and love!",

My family would ALWAYS bring home Mineo's and it will forever be in my top 3 in Pittsburgh. It's very heavy on the stomach, very cheesy and very greast, but the crust and toppings underneath the cheese are so freaking delicious.  For those of you viewing this page and are curious of other pizza places to check out that are in my top 5, look no further than below!  5) Michael's Pizza in Southside 4) Frank's Pizza & Chicken (Go to the one in MIllvale, order Buffalo Chicken). AMAZING. 3) Fiori's 2) Mineo's 1) Benny Fiero's in Southside  Benny Fiero's is more my style because of the THIN and CRISPY crust, but delicious and massive NY slice that I love.",

Had some issues with finding parking, and thought the places was really not that great upon stepping inside (kind of a dump). Went up to the corner and ordered. Not too many options to pick from. Beverages are by the bottle (pop, beers) Chose a 12\" pie with ricotta cheese and double cheese. Wait time was about a half hour. They call your name to come back to the counter and pick it up. Some may not like it, but we loved the puddle of oil (?) on top (you can dab it with some napkins if you want but it adds to the taste imo). The crust was soooooo good! The cheese was so stretchy (more than I've ever seen). Overall this was some darn good pizza! I would definitely return in a heartbeat and would recommend this place to anyone looking for really good pizza!",

Waited a half an hour, ate about half of the pizza and threw the rest away.  For the price, expected much better.   This used to be the best pizza in Pittsburgh.  I think they think that due to past reputation they can put out whatever garbage they want, and people will eat it up. Obviously they do not care about the competition, which put out much better product and at a far cheaper price.   Mineo's...step it up, guys.  Or the competition will put you out of business, regardless of your past reputation.",

I was expecting a major dough-wad when I got home. When I opened the box I was shocked that there were no pepperonis on my pepperoni pizza. Too late to go back, I took a bite and discovered the pepperonis were under the cheese!!   I am happy to report that the pizza was not the pepperoni-less dough-wad that I had feared, but was instead a delicious pepperoni pizza! The cheese was pretty thick. It took longer than they said it would for the pizza to be ready (they weren't busy and it was on a Wednesday) and the pizza was a little more expensive than I was expecting, but I was generally satisfied.",

I always end up going back though because my friends insist that we go there for a few slices.  So I'll be honest, if it's put in front of my face, I will not hesitate to eat it.

There is no fricken ambiance in this facility. But who the hell asks for ambiance from a pizza joint?  Hell, maybe the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give up giving up meat to eat a pepperoni pie here.  Can you get a better endorsement than that? I think not. Go and enjoy the pizza, save some of your crust to dip in the oil that is left. This isn't a health conscious pizza place, but who eats pizza for their health? Splurge and enjoy!",
