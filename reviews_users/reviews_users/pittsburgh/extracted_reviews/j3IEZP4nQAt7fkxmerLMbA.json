My friend is more of a whiskey drinker and was impressed with the choices. Great place to hit after ice skating and during the winter months.",

    "text": "Thank you, Yelp, for pointing us to Winghart's when a burger craving hit during our vacation in Pittsburgh.  Delicious!  The owner is a trained gourmet chef, so he knows what he's doing.  But this is by no means a dressed up, dainty, fancy restaurant gourmet burger.  This is a burger that gets the basics right.  The meat is fresh and perfectly cooked, and the buns are great.  The add-ons were also good, but you almost don't need anything on this burger because the meat is so perfect.   I love places where I can see my burger cooking.  The bar setting is complementary to the all-American menu, and you can't beat the Market Square location.  Highly recommended.",

As messy as this burger appeared outside of its wrapper it was pretty good. Sweet and Tangy in all the right ways.   My second to-go ordered happened today as I write this review for you now. I couldn't decided between the Colin Orangutan or the I Don't Care, Whatever Burger. I think I made the right choice this time with the IDCWB. OMG Sex in my mouth. The toppings for this burger are on point. Pepperjack, Bleu Cheese, Cheddar, Jalapenos, Pepperonicinis, Onions, Hot Sauce, Bacon, um yeah. Hell yeah. I licked all the sauce off my fingers.  GET. IT.

    "text": "That is pretty suspicious that the restaurant has been open 2 weeks and has already gathered 8 other reviews. The first four  reviewers are clearly bogus considering that they only have 1 or two reviews each. How many other restaurants will you find on Yelp with that kind of a distribution? Yeeeaaaah.  Anyway, for a real review, I will say that this place is reasonable, but it a pricey dining option for what you get. If you order a burger, fries are not included. If you order the fries with it, you get like a half pound of them. So, there really should be some in between where you order a burger and fries come with it. It is kind of expected from a burger joint and I find it annoying to order them a-la-carte. I ordered the Hula burger, and it tasted good, but not noticeably different from another burger place that would offer the same item (like Red Robin, for instance). The fries were good, but also, nothing special about them. The total cost was $10.97 including tax, so it is a bit steep for a burger and fry lunch.   I tasted my friend's chicken pizza, and I didn't like it. First it has what appeared to be sausage but was claimed to be chicken (\"chicken sausage\"). The cashier attempted to convince him that it was chicken when he asked about it, but I've never had chicken like that before. Why not just cut to the chase and put sausage on it? Second, it was loaded with bleu cheese which was too strong of a flavor for the pizza. Bleu cheese appears all over the menu, so this must be a favorite ingredient for the owner. Third, its one of those pizzas where you pick it up and the cheese just falls off because the breading folds down.  Getting your food delivered is very speedy and the beef is massed together on site (no pre-made patties), but there is limited seating. Also, they place your burger on a sheet of paper and place it on the counter. My burger was messy and so I kept thinking about the germs soaking through from the table. The menu is also very limited.   Overall, not bad, but clearly not as stellar as these other bogus reviews are trying to convince you of. It's a burger, not some dish that requires a degree from Le Cordon Bleu to prepare.  Appears that all credit cards are accepted here.  Food Quality/Taste = 4 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Price = 2 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 2 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes",

My dining pals had burgers that looked and smelled so good; they were raving over the flavor, freshness and ingredients. I'll have to get one next time.   The quarters are tight (only reason for four, not five stars) but they do plan to open seating upstairs soon. In the summer the entire front opens to outside seating. Everyone on staff seemed to genuinely enjoy preparing our food and they were extremely hospitable.

Bacon, mushrooms, gruyere cheese and honey mustard sauce on a freshly ground, high quality beef patty!  Are you kidding me?  I would drop kick someone if they got in the way of me and that burger!  My co-worker always gets the Shipwreck Burger and we constantly argue over which one tastes the best.  Add some \"seasoned\" fries with a side of homemade ranch dressing as a dipping sauce for your fries and you can easily slip into foodgasm territory.  Lawd a mercy, I might have to go ther today for lunch!",

Service was above average - our waitress Rebecca (?) offered some great suggestions on menu items, inquired about our first-time visit to PB, and was generally good company.  Wish I had more time to go back and try their burgers - next time.",

Perfectly cooked. And the fries were amazing as well. Exceptional service too. We will be back next time we're in Pittsburgh.",

We started with the Tikka Masala wings, which were great. Crispy on the outside, meaty and juicy on the inside, with a great Tikka Masala flavor. Then we had burgers, which were cooked perfectly and had all the right additions for unique and delicious flavors. We had some 1911 blueberry cider, which we were pleased to learn they have on tap. The Cajun fries were good too, but dipping them in ranch really took it to another level. Lastly, Caitlin really made the whole experience come together. She had great recommendations, was super friendly, and made us feel really welcome. Really great experience.",

The Shipwrecked burger's description was on point, its flavors were definitely for someone with a more sophisticated palette. It had a lot going on but it all melded together well. You definitely get the bitter, creamy, and sweet flavors out of all the toppings.",

Sadly, between terrible rush hour traffic in downtown and frigid temperatures, we were a little grumpy when we arrived. However, a beer (well, cider for me) quickly brightened our spirits.  I expected the interior to be a little larger and was surprised to see two separate rooms on two different floors. Most of both floors is taken up by a large bar with several tables in the back of both spaces. The tables are seat yourself, which also surprised me. I'm not sure how that would work on a busy Friday or Saturday night. Our waitress was nice and relatively attentive until the end of our meal, when she apologized for being a bit more hectic (around 7pm).   I ordered the Hula Burger, which was delicious! The bun was soft, and the meat was juicy. The BBQ sauce added a punch of flavor, while the pineapple provided the perfect fruity sweetness. I would definitely order this burger again... and again. The only con was that it was a little messy!",

I got the shipwreck burger which is really good, if you are willing to splurge a bit. Another must have are the fries with the truffle aioli. Delish! It is a little upsetting that the burgers don't come with anything (you have to order fries and what not separately) especially given what you pay for it. Drink options are good if you are feeling like some beer. All in all really good food, just a little over priced and bad service both times I've been there.",

I loved it. I never dabbled with bourbon before. The helpful bartenders did not lead me astray! I tried a few different types- the angel's envy Kentucky straight bourbon was my favorite. Just remember to sip if it is your first time, like me. I did sip it that night but ended up purchasing it weeks later. I regret drinking it so fast- 'nuff said.  The food. What can I say? The burger is juicy, rich, and perfectly cooked (MOO!).I ordered the shipwrecked- my fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong. The shipwreck has Brie cheese, crispy bacon, caramelized onions, arugula, and white truffle aioli. Oh and the hand-cut fries were finger-lickingly delicious. Crispy and tasty. Yum!

I wasn't a big fan of brie on a burger, but you could taste every component and the concept was pretty cool.  The fries were delicious.  Bigger than shoe strings, but definitely smaller than steak fries, they reminded me a little of Five Guy's fries.  The seating kind of sucks.  I would say this is more like a bar that serves awesome burgers (as opposed to a restaurant with a bar).  The decorations on the walls were cool and added to the atmosphere.",

Yes, even Bulleit and Buffalo Trace.   I got the 1lb burger (no bun, I don't eat that no more) and had it cooked rare. This is so far the best rare burger I've had in recent memory! One pound of ground meat smothered in cheese and mushrooms. Hang on, I just drooled on my keyboard...  And then the french fries! If I could drown them in the malt vinegar I would have been even more in heaven. (I can't eat the vinegar ya see? They do have it.) These are those crispy, thin, slightly thicker than shoe-string fries.   I hear the pizza is pretty good too.  The only reason I can't give it a five star rating is the difficult eating space. I'd really suggest showing up early to have a drink or two and then take your burger to go. There's probably like 20 seats total (the majority at the bar) but I have no problem saying I'll go back if someone wants to join me!",

I had the Shipwreck Burger, medium-rare, and he had a cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles, well-done, because he's a baby.   Anywho, my burger was awesome -- they toast the buns on the griddle, which i love, plus it was oozing with Brie, caramelized onions, truffle oil, bacon, and I don't even recall what else. I just know it was fantastic. The buns are large enough to hold the fairly large patties, but they're nice and light, so you don't feel like you're eating more bread than meat and toppings.   However, I must admit that when our food came, I didn't touch my burger for a few mins, because I was gobbling up the fries! Their fresh cut fries are phenomenal!!! I couldn't get enough. There's malt vinegar sitting on the counters, too, so I splashed some on. Love, love, love fries with vinegar.  I also must note their awesome on-tap beer selection (I had a hard pear cider), and whiskey selection, of course. They had a bottle of double black Johnnie Walker, which we'd never seen before, and our waitress (Crushin' D) was so kind as to bring the bottle over for us to check out, she told us a bit about it, and she poured a li'l sample for my BF to taste. She was also just friendly and all-around knowledgable, which I always appreciate.  The space itself is pretty small, tight, and dark, but it totally works. It's the right ambiance for them! They do accept credit cards, and I saw a dude come in to pick up grub, so they do take-out too, which is good to know!   All in all, Winghart's deserves top marks, and I'll definitely be back for more.",

The first time was better than the second. I ordered the shipwreck burger my first time and really liked the taste of brie cheese, bacon, and white truffle aioli in my burger. Great flavor. And I was so hungry that I ate the whole thing in four or five bites. The second time I was here I wasn't that hungry so I just ordered an original hippy cake that was topped with powdered sugar. Not bad but nothing extraordinary. The service was really slow the second time around. My boyfriend ordered a dozen wings to go and they hadn't even finished making them thirty minutes later. We had to catch a bus and were contemplating leaving without our food - it was that slow. Luckily, they finished cooking the wings at the last second and we paid. Even paying was slow and we had to constantly remind the server that we had to leave immediately. There wasn't even a lot of people there but it was like the staff was extremely unprepared to handle more than a few customers at a time.",

Great beer and whiskey selection as-well.  This restaurant was hugely popular during the lunch rush over the summer and caused me to unfortunately not visit very frequently due to the amount of time required to have lunch.  They've opened some dining space upstairs and appear to be doing a bit better turning meals around in the kitchen.  Hopefully they'll keep improving their speed and this place will become a go-to for a quick (and delicious) lunch.  Recommend the Shipwreck burger, the Pittsburgh salad with chicken patty, or the Winghart-attach pizza.    Good stuff.",

I was thinking they were going to have a large drink menu with imaginative drinks but they just had a couple beers and \"anything else we wanted the bartender to make\".  I got the shipwreck burger and my brother in law got a bacon cheeseburger.  You could tell the meat was freshly ground, it was excellent.  The white truffle aioli was sickening by the end of it but still a very good burger.  People need to learn how to take it easy with truffle, a little goes a long way.  Vodka/soda's were strong and cheap!",

Being a huge fan of anything with pineapple, I ordered a well done Hula burger.  Unfortunately for me, it arrived closer to medium rare.  I am not into blood red staring me in the face while I try to eat.  Of course, they were nice enough to throw it back on the grill and actually cook it.  But still, that kinda took away from truly enjoying my burger.  BJ got a blue cheese, which he enjoyed.  And their fries are very yummy.    One plus is the servers.  And even though our server messed up my burger order, she was very attentive and friendly.  Plus sitting at the bar, watching the cooking show was kinda fun.  Also, be forewarned, this place is a real dive.  I am sure when they open their Warrendale location, it will be much nicer.  I will save trying another Winghart's burger until that time.  Nothing about our experience will have me running back to Market Square for a burger.  Sorry to say.....",

    "text": "Heard good things about Winghart's burgers. But after eating here on Saturday night, I could not figure out what was so good about this place. I had three main problems.  The first problem was that fries didn't come with the burgers. (Wait, but why?!) Instead, we had to order fries to share. Got the white truffle aioli fries and they were pretty good. Server told us that one order of the fries would be enough for the five of us, but she was kind of wrong.  Second problem. My burger was made wrong. Way more cooked than I had requested. I'm not really much of a complainer (in person, I mean), so I just tried to eat it. I ordered the Dockburger mostly because I just wanted more fries, so I literally only ate the fries and two bites of the actual burger and couldn't do anymore.  Third problem was the service. Yes it was a Saturday night so yes they were busy, but they were just really, really slow with everything. We spent a lot of the time watching the pizza guy make pizza because the kitchen was right next to us. Oh, so was the bathroom. It's a pretty cramped space, but I was not a fan of how the bathroom was literally right next to our table. I mean we had a guy dressed up as Santa chat with us while he waited for the bathroom (SantaCon was going on) and that was nice, but a table right next to the bathroom just wasn't the best spot. Also, my friend ordered a beer and it literally came AFTER she paid for her meal, and by then she was too full. She wasn't charged for the beer, but not once during the meal was she told by the server why she still didn't have her beer yet.   The 25-minute wait was fine, but of course, if I had known earlier all the things above, I would not have waited that long.  Taste | 2 Atmosphere | 2 Presentation | 2 Service | 2 OVERALL | 2",

It took a little while for us to be approached by a waitress to be seated. When we were finally approached we were treated with a great deal of respect by the gentleman that seated us. But our waitress was not as good. He was not attentive and he did not give off an inviting persona. Customer service set aside my food experience was pretty good. I ordered a burger that I essentially made my own. I placed sauted peppers and onions to a basic cheese burger. The total of my burger was $12. The burger was absolutely PHENOMENAL!! I asked for it to have no red and it was cooked exactly to my liking. The burger was juicy and was a substantial size. The bread was very soft and the cheese was perfectly melted on top. The prices here are not the best especially because I had to order fries separate which was $4. Though I shared them it was still a pretty penny for something that should automatically come with a burger. The other two people that came with us shared a Sahanna Margherita pizza. I had the opportunity to try a slice and I did not like it. Though I never appreciated Margherita style pizza I'm sure someone who likes that would really appreciate it. Over all in hopes of better costumer service even with the hefty prices I'd recommend relying this restaurant to friend.",

    "text": "I've been to the market square location a few times. Most recently I had a craft beer and the BBQ Pineapple pizza. They have a great beer selection on tap, alongside several mixed drink features. The food menu consists of a few apps, a selection of mac & cheese options, pizza, salads, and burgers (what they are known for). This location seems to be either super busy (big event days) or a nice mild busy. I was pleased to see the service in market square was much better than what I experienced recently in the Southside location. Waitress was very friendly and even though the pizza took a while she explained why and apologized... which is enough for me to relax and wait a few minutes longer.  The outdoor seating is both on the first and a few tables on the second floor balcony. Very nice way to experience the evening in market square!",

    "text": "Found this place on Yelp, and since it was a short walk from our friend's apartment we decided it was the place to go.  We waited about 10 minutes for an inside, upstairs, table for the 4 of us.  We started with an order of the truffle aioli fries, suggest getting these, and also an order of the Grampa style pierogis, which are fried with bacon and onions.  They were both fabulous and would definitely get both again.  The hubs and I both went with burgers because one of the main reasons we chose this place was my burger craving.  I went with the Shipwreck and he had the Denny Double Bleu.  The meat in the burgers was definitely fresh and not overworked. The meat was tender and seasoned , but not overly, because we both had multiple toppings on the burger.  If it was seasoned too much we would have had a salt overload.  All 4 of us were impressed and will be back again. Unfortunately no military discount.",

    "text": "Not my favorite. My coworkers and I came here for a birthday lunch and it being my boss's favorite burger place, I was really excited to try one of their burgers. I ordered the Market Square burger which was $12.50 and their burgers do not come with fries. That's pretty outrageous for a burger that only had cheese, mushrooms, bacon and honey mustard. A basket of fries (which is pretty large) is $4. So if you want a burger meal with fries to share, it'll cost you over $16. Yikes. I guess this is ok for dinner but a little steep for lunch. Another thing to mention, their honey mustard is more just mustard. I didn't quite get any honey from what I tasted. And yet another note to mention, the burger here made me really sick afterwards. Ugh. So for a burger in Market Square, you can probably find a similar, maybe better, burger at Diamond Market for a slightly lower price tag and it'll come with fresh cut fries.",

The upstairs is pretty cozy and has a nifty looking bar.  It is definitely a more intimate setting up there and was perfect for conversation.  I \" put (my) HART into it\" as the menu says and ordered a beef patty with cheddar , lettuce, tomato, and ketchup on a gluten free bun.  Overall, it was a pretty good burger, no contamination issues.  I'd go back for the atmosphere.  Menu is a bit limited for celiacs, in my opinion.",

Not sure whats changed in the past six months but service is TERRIBLE.  We had a 10 person group, were told to seat ourselves- the waiter couldn't even look up at us. So we sat ourselves and took the only two tables left and moved them next to each other. He YELLED at us and asked what we were doing. A few friends had already ordered drinks upstairs because it took so long to get service downstairs. They paid their bills and we left immediately.  Last week a group of friends went down-- they yet again couldn't accommodate our group. The same man who yelled last time, yelled this time.  A few days later we stopped by for a few drinks, they shut the doors in our face at 9pm. This had happened a few times before as well.  Its too expensive to be that rude to customers.  Incredibly disappointed with how the quality of service has gone downhill.",

I like sitting at the bar/counter and watching the cooks prepare everything; I find that fascinating.  I also find that lends a cool, off-beat vibe to the restaurant.  The pizzas are out of the world.  The hand-stretched crust is to die for and then when they fire it and you get that crunch on the outside with the chew on the inside of the crust, I'm in heaven.  I love their Sweet Georgia Brown pizza.  It's my favorite at the current moment.  Now let's talk burgers.  These are the burgers that you eat with your elbows on the tables and your sleeves rolled all the way up so you don't get burger juice on your clothes.  Ah-mazing.  The Dockworker is insanity in a very good way.  Even if your burger comes with fries on it, get a basket of fries to go beside it because those things are the bomb-diggity.  Yes, I just said bomb-diggity because they're so good I don't care.  Servers are friendly and quick, but I love the food so much I wouldn't care if they were the meanest people on the planet. Seriously that good.",

They are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable about their products, and chatty without being annoyingly so. And the music they play - I love it. The music selections have never irked me when I've stopped it.  My favorite burger there, and in fact the only burger I've ever ordered lol, is the Shipwreck.

    "text": "I was really looking forward to this burger, and maybe I suffered from high expectations after hearing about how it was one of the best in the city, but the whole thing left me a little disappointed and feeling pretty \"meh\" about the whole thing.  The service and the restaurant itself had their pros and cons, but let's be honest--the entire experience hinges on the burger.  So that's what I'll talk about.  Most importantly, they missed the temperature on both my burger and the burger my dinner companion ordered.  I ordered medium rare, and I got medium.  She ordered medium, and got at least well done (if not more cooked).  At a place that specializes in burgers, that shouldn't happen (especially on two out of two patties when the place wasn't even that crowded).  Two of my toppings were likewise overcooked, to an even greater degree.  My mushrooms and bacon were both so crispy and overdone that they had lost all taste and color.  My companion's toppings were a little better, but they slathered on the aioli (which was basically just mayo) to a point where the other ingredients became overpowered and obscured.  It seemed like a fun enough place, and the ingredients were high quality (especially the meat--my burger patty, despite the missteps in execution, still had decent flavor and juiciness).  I might go back and try the pizzas, but from what I saw, Winghart's has a long way to go before being considered an elite burger joint.",

There was not much decor to speak of but our seats right near the brick oven were awesome and allowed us to watch all of the food being made.  The restaurant was lively and there was a whirl of activity in the kitchen to watch.  For lunch I had the Hula Burger while my dining companion had the Market Square Burger. We also split an order of their cheese fries.  The Hula Burger was good with the burger cooked perfectly but most of my toppings fell off while trying to eat the burger.  It all tasted pretty good although I wish it would have stayed together better.   The beer fries were also good with better than normal fries and a very thick beer cheese sauce.  They are definitely not your normal beer cheese fries.  My dining partner said that the Market Square burger was good as well.  The bottom line for me is that the food was good here and the burgers tasted good.  I wouldn't call it the best burger in Pittsburgh but they were definitely good.  With all of that being said, I will probably head back in the future.",

I only like Hendricks but the bartender came out to me to explain different gins he had that I might like. He suggested I try Plymouth instead. He was right. They also make their own seltzer or tonic on site. This tasted great!   For food, we had whiskey BBQ wings - delicious! A Jefferson burger - also delicious. Dude Ranch Fries - phenomenal!

I ordered the \"Shipwreck Burger\" (sans bun for a gluten free friendly meal) and thought it was pretty decent, albeit overcooked. The toppings were what made it - brie, caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. It was a litlle heavy on the aioli but that was rather easily fixed. Hubby got the \"I Don't Care, Whatever\" with pepper jack, bleu cheese, cheddar, jalapenos,caramelized onions, pepperonicini, hot sauce, and bacon (also sans-bun) and felt the same as I - decent (and overcooked) burger, really good toppings.   In full disclosure, we did not notify the waitress of the overcooked patties - we just didn't want to wait for a second one to come out and hold up the rest of the party. Honestly I think it should come out right the first time anyway, but I know one can't really complain unless they try to rectify the problem, so no star lossage for the meat mishandling. :)  We split a side of fries which were a little too greasy/overcooked but seasoned well.   We sat outside so the \"ambiance\" was great - we got to people watch and enjoy some nice weather. Service was just fine.   It was generally a 3 star experience but the breadth and creativity of the menu, both with burgers and pizzas, bumped them up one star.",

We ordered porogies to start and I ordered the boomer pizza my buddy a basic pepperoni pizza and Jose a burger protein style. I ordered a ruby mule as well. Our drinks took a bit to arrive. Our food however took 45 minutes to come out. The waitress was super nice and conscious of the time. She sent the manager over to talk to us. They handled it very well. I felt bad for the server. Two tables of customers left.  The food was mediocre. The porogies were delicious",

    "text": "After months of searching for a late-night dining options last summer, my co-workers and I happened into Winghart's after a long shift. Finding a kitchen that serves after 11PM in Pittsburgh is a rarity, let alone on a Sunday night. We took advantage of the outdoor seating and were quickly greeted by our server, who was personable without being overbearing. The whiskey aficionado of our group was impressed by the extensive selection of offerings, and there were several beer and cocktail options that appealed to the rest of us right off the bat. The decision was made to divide and conquer on the food front, which ended up being a great strategy. We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food, which makes sense since everything is made from scratch. The Shipwreck Burger is, hands-down, the best burger I've ever had and the O.G. Mac is now my roommate's go-to option for comfort food. Portion sizes are large without being overwhelming, and we've never experienced less than stellar service from any of the employees; it's quickly become our favorite late-night spot.  Working in the service industry, I am constantly on the look-out for places to recommend to guests coming into town; my co-workers and I send people to Winghart's throughout the week and are always regaled with stories of an all-around fantastic dining and/or drinking experience. It's a wonderful testament to the work ethic of this locally owned and operated business to maintain a loyal customer base while attracting new fans in a town where restaurants come and go in the blink of an eye. Keep up the excellent work!",

    "text": "With winging a last minute trip to Pittsburgh, a late night arrival, and in an area that's surprisingly slim on bars and eats, I remained skeptical of the one place that seemed hopeful: this place. Then I considered the location of being right in Market Square, their name (both odd & conveys a message of a cocktail bar, their logo (note sure if it was local), the photos of the upstairs bar, and I really didn't think it was going to go well. I just imagined those vibrating beepers that hosts hand you so they gyrate in your pocket to be seated.   Instead, not looking upstairs, and I think we got lucky on being Thanksgiving weekend, there was barely anyone there and we were able to sit right in front of the burger griddle. And the staff was the complete opposite of what I expected. And I loved them for it. Two teddy bears of large chaps behind the counter made me laugh through the whole night. Add on I was with the cute Canadian, and it was such a perfect odd couple pairing for the setting. I don't know if this would be a real dive-dive, and I don't know what the standards are for Pittsburgh, but I love how bare bones, and blue collar this feels.   Now. I usually put nothing on my burger but cheese. Apparently someone stared into their lunch pale in Pittsburgh and put their coleslaw and fries on their sandwich. If I were ever going to put this on a burger, it was then, and it was excellent. Large enough to not need any sides at all but a beer.   It feels like an off the beaten path place that's wisely plopped in the middle of Market Square. I dig your move Pittsburgh. I'd imagine most visitors make their way here, and if this is the style you're promoting, you're one of a kind in a very good way.",

Ordered a medium burger and it was well done and the patty was pretty thin (almost seemed pre-made rather than made fresh as well?). This is unacceptable in a place primarly known for gormet burgers - why even ask me how I want it to be cooked? Well done burgers are the worst. Apparently \"onion straws\" as advertised don't really exist there... instead got some huge chunks of fried onion on the burger, which didn't have the same nice texture as I expected and were harder to eat. The atmosphere was also lacking - kind of dingy inside and pretty dead around dinner time. I will not be back.. plenty of other places in the city to get a better burger...",

    "text": "Wingharts is definitely different. Am I glad I checked it out? Sure. Would I make a point to stop by again? Likely not. The atmosphere upstairs (read: bar) was eclectic and fun, yet super tight with not a lot of seating. We were there on a Monday afternoon and were hoping for a quick taste of Pittsburgh. We ordered pierogies (one of my favorite things on earth) Grampa style (caramalized onions and bacon) and requested a side of sour cream. They came out without the sour cream and after asking for it twice, we gave up. It didn't come up in conversation again until the bill came and we were charged for it. They kindly removed it without hassle, but I was still a little annoyed. I don't get back East very often, so I was hoping to have them how I wanted them.  We also added the white truffle aioli french fries to our \"healthy\" lunch. They were, hands down, the best part of our entire experience. YUM!  For the entree, we ordered a Dockworker burger. It's a bit like Primanti Bro's with french fries and cole slaw. I learned if I want something like Primanti Bro's, I should go TO PB. It was HORRIBLE. I'm not sure what it was about it, but I took one bite and couldn't eat another. I don't typically eat this type of fare (bar food or the like) so that could've been it, but I definitely don't recommend that burger.   If I were to go back, I'd likely order a pizza as those looked better than anything else I saw come out.",

Usually I hate olives, but the Rachel Goes to Greece pizza, which has plenty of them was absolutely delicious.    Wingharts makes an amazing burger no matter which location you go to; however, I think I like the South Side location a little better simply because it is bigger and more comfortable.  But then again, nothing beats that classic rough bar feel that the original gives off.  The staff was also very pleasant and friendly.  They loved he fact that my mom and I put down an entire pizza and two hamburgers.   DELICIOUSLY PERFECT!!",

The wings were good, once we sent them back to have them actually tossed in buffalo sauce, though these was something subtly weird tasting about the buffalo sauce....not enough to preclude my enjoyment of them.  They were crispy, just like I like'em!  The cheese fries were awful. The cheese was bad, and the fries were (burnt, overdone, weird tasting) worse! I ate a couple and had to convince my husband to let me eat more than my fair share of the wings so I didn't go hungry.   I'll go back, I'm sure, but with low expectations and a mental note to never order the fries.",

This place came highly recommended by the hotel as well as locals walking around on the street at the Square. We were not disappointed with our food entrees at all. Most of us ordered burgers which were phenomenal. We did have one member of our team order the wings, and he was rather disappointed in them. I would say that he is somewhat of a wing guru and has had wings all over the country. He didn't feel these were up to par. All of our burgers however were great. These are not your average burgers, and all meet is fresh ground daily. They even advertise nothing is prepared with a microwave nor a freezer. They do have an average burger, but most of these are specialty burgers. Very unique and extremely flavorful. French fries are fresh cut as well and really good. Not the best place to take a large group however since the seating is limited. We had to pull several small round tables together for our group, however we did make it work. The waitress took pretty good care of us.  There is an upstairs and downstairs to this establishment. The downstairs is basically a long bar area. The upstairs has a little bit of additional seating which was where we were at. There is also a small bar upstairs.  The food was so good, I would definitely recommend stopping by to grab a bite to eat. Don't let the looks on the outside for you, as this is a really good place to eat.",

    "text": "Wow, if this was my first time at Winghart's my initial thought would be that I was never going to return. When we walked into the restaurant, the hostess asked us how many in our party. I told her that we have 2 and she said \"Well, it's first come first serve so if you want to leave and check back later you can. You have a few groups ahead of you but we don't take names or reservations.\" I was very puzzled by this response because how are they supposed to keep track of their customers if they are just telling you to leave and try back? We decided to wait there so we didn't lose our spot and she kept telling us not to block the door or the hallway, but we didn't have anywhere else to go. Finally, someone came down from the upstairs (possibly a bus boy?) and told us there's a table upstairs and that we could go up and seat ourselves. We were shoved in a corner table near the bar and our waitress was the bartender. She was VERY pushy asking for our orders and then as soon as she took our order she quit her shift and we never had another waiter/waitress again. I had to ask the bus boy for napkins, ketchup, our check, etc. In addition to the lackluster service, there was a large group of drunk women at the bar that were a huge disruption to anyone on the top floor. They were spilling their drinks and they even went into the closet and took out brooms to use as microphones and not a single worker said anything to them! When our food finally arrived, the burger looked smaller than usual, but we were starving so we dug in. My fiance and I both had onion straws on our burger, which were $1 each, and they were in a huge, stale clump on our burgers. I've been to Winghart's before and this honestly was an embarrassment to the establishment. For two beers, two burgers, and an order of fries we paid $50... outrageous! I will definitely not be visiting this establishment in the future.",

We all asked for medium and our burgers were mushy, red, and cold in the middle. Really just the outside was brown.   Everything was so good though that I would suggest going and just asking for a longer cooking time than you usually would.",

One thing I will say negative about Winghart's is the ala carte menu.  For the type and quality of the food there along with the price, you really should have fries/chips/something included as a side with a burger.  The other thing to note is that waitresses were very friendly and attentive.  Food was average, but far from bad.  Just if you are picking between here and say Burgatory, head over to the North Shore and get a better burger with fries for the same price.  If you want that \"dive bar\" experience, then Wingharts is your place in Market Square.",

The place was slightly noisy and there's a jukebox but the music was at the perfect volume.  I ordered the Necessity with onions instead of jalapenos.  I'm a fan of spicy food about as much as Pirates fans enjoy seeing the Cardinals win.  The burger was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the BBQ/honey mustard combo.  The fries were well seasoned but a tad salty.  My wife got the funnel cake.  As natives of New Jersey, we are used to funnel cakes from the Jersey Shore (hold the Snooki).  The funnel cake was delicious.  The service was great and I would recommend this place.",

    "text": "It's been a few years since my last review here, and in that time Wingharts has undergone a menu overhaul and a remodel after they dealt with a fire a couple years ago. Fortunately, they're still the best, despite/because of the changes! And they're going so strongly I think I have to brag on their behalf a little.  For starters, I'm actually really super impressed with the remodeling this location went through. Wingharts admittedly really looked like a bar when I first visited this spot, not a burger or pizza joint. Now, the remodel has given the owners a chance to add some great decor, color, and lighting to the place - and I definitely think the new touches make Wingharts more welcoming.  More importantly, while the menu has changed a tad, it's still absolutely amazing! In the last month I've been here three times and I've gotten three different and excellent meals:  *During a lunch out with friends I discovered this burger and pizza joint serves an amazing spinach salad! Fresh green spinach, gruyere cheese, bacon, sliced egg...yum! It's called the Popeyes Guilty Pleasure, since crabcakes are an optional topping here. I recommend them, too, because they are good crabcakes!  *Before seeing a comedy show I stopped in intending to enjoy a little pizza. Instead of having leftovers for the next day as I expected, I devoured an entire Boomer pizza - fresh dough topped with arugula, bacon, caramelized onion, truffle aioli, brie cheese, and crimini mushrooms. Now THAT is one delectable pizza!  *Finally, for my birthday I stopped in with a friend and we ordered two amazing burgers, along with an appetizer: their spinach and artichoke dip. This may be my favorite dip in the city - it's so fresh, filled with flavor, and even comes with a small \"kick\". And while I will forever love my Shipwreck burger, I can now say the Market Square Burger is a cheesy delight, with mushrooms and bacon to boot.  Oh, and the cherry on top of this already winning lineup? The fantastic cocktail menu that is full of refreshing and super tasty drinks all around. I haven't had a single drink I didn't like here yet, and it's common for me to order more than one of them while I'm here. Usually I avoid this to save cash, but they're so good here I can't resist them.  So kudos to you, Wingharts - you're definitely still one of my fav places to dine and drink at in the 'Burgh! Keep it up, please!",

None?! No wings, not even plain?! Super disappointed. I glanced over the menu and ended up getting the \"Salad a la Pittsburgh\" without fries and cheese. They didn't have oil and vinegar (Boo!) for dressing so I used balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was relatively filling with the egg, grilled chicken breast, red onion, tomatoes and pepperoncinis but it was still a relatively basic salad for $13. My friend ordered a large serving of fries for $4 so depending on what food you want, cost can be low. The service was wonderful- the staff was attentive, friendly and made sure we had a full pitcher of water at all times! I drink a ton of water so this is much appreciated! What I really liked was the ambiance- the bar/seating area upstairs was dimly lit with some re-purposed items around the place, very urban and artsy. Even the bathrooms were cute! I would definitely come back here to try something else off of the menu and enjoy the cool vibe!",

Reasonable prices and possibly the best pierogies I've ever had in Pittsburgh, where pierogies are a tradition. Get the \"grandpa style\" with bacon and fried onions - you won't be disappointed (and they are made fresh in-house daily). My daughter ordered the grandma's mac and cheese. Despite a warning on the menu that it would take extra time, we were served within 20 minutes. They don't use microwaves or freezers in the restaurant - everything is freshly made. The crust on their pizzas is amazing, and my son loved his \"hula burger\" with pineapple and other toppings. If you eat upstairs, try to snag a table with a view of Market Square - or eat outside on the balcony if the weather allows.",

I had been in the clan that thought that Tessaro's had the best burger, but they will have to admit defeat.  Wingharts (do you pronounce the \"h\" or is it a silent \"h\"?) wins!  I had the Shipwreck burger which combined the best medium rare meat with melty, deliciou brie.  I think most things would be better with brier, but sadly it is not on the table in restaurants to add to things like salt or ketchup.  It should be.  It also had bacon, truffle aioli, carmelized onions (that might be the best carmelized onions I have ever had - I didn't know that was something that could be better than the normal awesomeness that is carmelized onions, but these are it) and arugula.  All in all, everything was perfect.  Seriously.  Nothing to complain about at all.   M had the veggie burger which I had been very tempted to get and since the brie burger was definitely not on the diet, I will get the next time.  It was a falafel patty that was awesome with artichoke spread, arugula, feta cheese and olives.    She also got fries, cooked in peanut oil and awesome.   I am going back next week.  Can't wait!",

    "text": "I stopped by here yesterday afternoon with my BF while we were waiting for the airport bus. I got the Collin's Orangutan burger - chicken patty, green apple, caramelized onions, gouda, and bacon. The chicken itself was super juicy, which was a nice surprise, and all of the other components complemented each other really well. My boyfriend got the Matolla bacon cheeseburger and that was also delicious.  The cocktails were a little more hit or miss. I wouldn't recommend the strawberry moonshine/iced tea drink (it may have been called the pink lady?) - the taste was just off plus it wasn't cold. I liked the bourbon-lemon cocktail though.  Service was fine. I probably wouldn't bring my parents but I would def recommend it to anyone with a burger craving!",

    "text": "Moving to Pittsburgh and living in Bloomfield the first place I heard about was Tessaro's, \"Yinz gotta try TessAros, best burger in Pixburgh!\"  Ehh, okay, , not real juicy, not much flavor, but a sort of  solid burger (I think this place gets too much credit because it has been around so long).    Then came BRG, in my opinion as good or better than Tessaro's, though a bit inconsistent.  Then there was Burgatory, best burger I had in Pittsburgh and one of the best ever, i didn't think for Pittsburgh it would get much better than that.  Little did I know that Winghart's was just waiting for me.  My wife and I decided to have the same burger, the Mattola, you know traditional, beef, bacon and cheese.  This was the best burger I have ever feasted on.  Not overly seasoned (if at all) just enough and the flavor of the beef shined.  The bacon was plentiful and crispy and the cheese perfectly melted.  The fries were also damn good, perfect fries for the supplied malt vinegar...  The beer selection, though small, was solid.   The atmosphere was what I like, small, dark and laid back.  I will be back and probably sooner than later.",

    "text": "It seems that pretty much all the food they serve here are decent, but from their menu I got the sense that their burgers were the main draw. That, in addition to hearing from many people that the burgers here are some of the best in Pittsburgh. They have a pretty good list of different burger creations, as well as a customizable option. It was also nice that they're willing to do substitutions (for example, beef patty instead of chicken sausage that one comes with). While they don't come with fries, most are pretty inexpensive, some being just under $10. I got the Market Square burger and it was juicy and flavorful. Not only did I appreciate that they chopped up the tomatoes, onions, and pickles (instead of giving me huge slices of each), but I was pleasantly surprised by how well most of the burger stayed intact while I was eating it. Great feature!",

    "text": "Winghart's Burger and Whiskey Bar does what it's name implies very well and fails at everything else.  They have a great whiskey selection and KILLER burgers.  The burgers are huge, reasonably priced, inventive and the patties are surprisingly savory and don't sit in your stomach like rocks like some greasy burgers.  They also offer pizzas, salads and sandwiches on the menu, all of which are unfortunately either typical american faire or blandly prepared.  I got the \"Winghart Attack Pizza\" with chilli, cheddar and bacon, which sounded like the holy grail of culinary perfection!  In fact, it was unbelievably boring and tasteless.  I'm still shocked, how could pizza, chilli, cheddar and bacon not be great?  But they managed to make it taste like it was prepared in a high school cafeteria and left under heat lamps.  The place is dive, it's small, cramped, poorly decorated, and they only have one or two tiny tables, so plan on eating at the bar.  To be clear, the burgers and whiskey are excellent and fairly priced, and if you go for that you will not be disappointed.  If you expect atmosphere, you venture out into the rest of the menu, you do so at your own peril.",

    "text": "I want to be amazed by Winghart's - I really do. Blame it on the non-meat eating thing that I wouldn't fall in love with a burger joint. But my rating is based on the whole package, which needs some help.   First, the layout is totally confusing. It's a logistical nightmare in fact. It looks like you should order when you walk in, because they hand you menus. But, if you're sitting in the back, they'll give you table service. And last time I was in, they were showing the Sci Fi channel on TV and there was no music. Just ... kinda weird.   Second, they now have a liquor license. They have ~6 beers on draft, and a nice selection of whiskey (which, by the way, if you order a booze they don't have - they will assert that they are a whiskey bar and that's why they don't have something). The beers are stupid overpriced, however. I've been to literally the best beer bar in the world, and even they aren't this ridiculous. And what the heck is an 8 oz pour? Beers for babies? Example: I had a Rogue Chipotle. 5.5% ABV. 8 oz pour. $6. Come on now.   Third ... my veggie burger was deep fried. I wonder if they could do it on the grill - will have to request next time. The fries are really tasty though. Hand cut.   Fourth (and final, I promise): A group of four came in looking to grab a quick drink. The two girls working behind the bar first said order with the one, then order with the other. Go ahead a grab a table. No, just order at the bar then go get your table. You're confused? Me too. So, on 2 draft beers and 2 vodka cranberries, the group left \"$1 and change\". I know this because the server complained about it in front of the bar, and bar customers after the group left.   I'm definitely going to try the South Side one, because I feel like maaaybe this location is just being pushed to the wayside, which is unfortunate because it has a TON of potential. Market Square is in the midst of a 360 degree reinvention and it would be nice to keep this place as a stable go-to with just a couple improvements.",

The first day, after a full day of flying from California running on almost no food, the group that I traveled with were very hungry. Walking around downtown Pittsburg we came across Winghart's Burgers. Our group was relatively large, but the staff was really nice and still seated us. Our group couldn't all sit together, but that was fine.   The waitresses and cooks were extremely friendly! This definitely wasn't California haha. One of the waitresses sat down with us and told us about the menu, and how their ground beef was never frozen nor microwaved. I ordered a double patty one pound burger (it was huge!!). After we ordered and while we waited for food the waitress super friendly and continued to chat with us about the town, since we were new. And we talked about California as well.   We got the food. First, the fries were really good! They were fresh cut, seasoned well and tasted great! next was the burger. The fresh burger was awesome! They say it was never frozen, and I think that definitely put it as one of the top burgers I've ever eaten. If I ever make it back to Pittsburg (PA, not CA), Winghart's Burgers will definitely see me again!",

This place has brick walls, a bar that runs half the length of the establishment, tall tables by the walls, and a general slightly treandy bar atmosphere.  Full Disclosure: I did not have any whiskey.  I had the Hula burger which was fine. The meat was good, the toppings messy, the bun large enough for the thick patty. A fine burger but not the best I've ever had.  The fries seemed fresh cut but may not be. They were crispy and tasty.  They played recent (last 5 years) alternative hits with a few 90's hits. I really liked that.  Our waitress was great. Attentive, pleasant, funny.",

Yes, it may still be a narrow space to wiggle yourself into downstairs, but now the upstairs is open, which offers you even more space to squeeze into! I say squeeze because it's still unbelievably busy, regardless of the day or time. But that's the price you pay for having legit tasting food.  I say legit because everything here stands alone. Burgers aside, I've had a stellar pizza and now an awesome veggie Stromboli type offering that rocked my world just as much as the burger. And don't even get me started on their double fried fries! If you like crispy taters, you won't want to pass these bad boys up.  They of course have a massive whiskey list and pretty impressive draft beer line up. With two bars now, they're fully loaded and ready to go. Can't wait until the summer so I can sit out on their new upstairs deck and spy down on the square below. But, I'll surely be back before the warmer weather. Heck, I'll probably be back next week!",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem.  A buddy and I found this place on Yelp and liked how it was rated.  Surrounded by other larger and brighter restaurants in Market Square, I'm not sure we would have stopped in on our own but glad we did.  The first day we went we sat downstairs at the bar where we watched the food being prepared.  It was fun to interact with the cooks and staff as we waited for our meals.  We ordered the mojo fries, OG mac and cheese and a couple burgers to split.  The mac was outstanding.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.  The fries were fresh, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.    I ordered the \"I don't care whatever\" burger.  I had a slight misunderstanding with the waitress about how I wanted it cooked but she quickly resolved the issue and the cooks quickly made me a new burger.  All I can say is it's one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The meat was fresh and cooked perferctly.  The toppings we're diced small which lends to the eating experience; I got a mix of everything in each bite.  The had a good selection of craft beers.    After dinner we went upstairs and ordered a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't exactly call it a full bar but they do have a great selection of burbons and scotch.  They seem to specialize in Manhattens and Old Fashioneds.  I ordered Blanton's burbon on the rocks.  The bartender realized he didn't have enough so rather than giving me a weak pour, he gave me Four Roses Single Barrel at the lower Blanton's price!  Great customer service.  We loved this place so much we went back two nights later this time sitting upstairs.  We ordered the beer cheese fries which were great.  The beer cheese wasn't overly cheesey, it had a slight gravy flavor.  We also ordered the blue cheese and garlic mac and cheese.  If I were to be super picky this is where I would have my only complaint.  I expected more fresh garlic and the blue cheese they use is very mild and didn't really stand out from the regular cheese sauce.  I'm not sure it was worth the extra 5 or 6 dollars over the regular mac and cheese.  That being said it was still quality and tasted great.  I ordered the same burger I had before.  I don't give 5 stars easily but this place deserves it.  Anything this place lacks in size and space it more than makes up for in armosphere, food and customer service.",

Mezcal. Bacon. Chile. Oranges. I had the Popeye's Quilty Pleasure spinach salad and a bunless Shipwrecked. White truffle oil, arugula and that creamy smooth Gruyere cheese played a fan duel between fresh and deep.   Normally bacon is waved around like a carrot in front of the horse. Not so here. It's an accent, it doesn't need banners and pro-fat pictures.   Kelli M made sure if I didn't like anything it would be replaced post haste. I go to places like this because I can't yet master this drink/food mastery. I don't need to. I'm going to lay in the sun now & appreciate how they played \"Double Trouble,\" blues and jazz shredding the strings the way a lady needs it.   I'm a good girl. I cleaned my plate. I'll have whiskey next time.",

We went here for dinner not too long ago and everyone's meal was completely delicious, the service was incredibly attentive, the jukebox was fun, they have a great selection of beers, and they mix solid drinks.  It looks like a cheesy restaurant from the outside, and the name doesn't help either, but the value you get is definitely worth it.",

It's tucked away in the corner of the square and the only thing that may catch your eye is the 2nd floor balcony, otherwise it's pretty unassuming.  However, the decor inside is trendy and the vibe is very chill.  My friends and I stopped in for a drink on a Sunday afternoon while we were exploring the downtown area and we were not disappointed!  I'm a big beer lover, but I could not pass up on the cocktails here.  Our bartender/server Chris was so great about customizing our cocktails (we like things on the less sweet side) and every drink he made us was amazing!  I highly recommend either the Day at the Spa or Spring Forward!  The food shouldn't be overlooked either.  The pirogies were great, but the hand cut fries with truffle aoli stole the show!  Best fries I've had in a long, long while!  All in all we spent a few hours on their 2nd floor patio enjoying the most delicious cocktails and had an amazing afternoon at Wingharts, definitely don't miss this place!",

The shells were perfectly soft with a little bite and the cheese was perfectly seasoned and so flavorful.   We ordered the kids a pepperoni pizza, expecting a basic pizza. It was definitely not. It was well cooked, flavorful and not a bit went to waste.   I had the incredibly well cooked and assembled Harper Burger. It was so addicting I did not want to put it down. My husband had the shipwreck. The one bite he shared had a lot of flavor and was well cooked.   We also ordered the white truffle aioli fries (that our 3 year old was in love with) and the beer cheese fries. It was all so delicious that we ate well past the point of being full.",

I personally preferred the James O wings. They had a hint of sweet with a little spice. The wings were probably a little on the softer side; I like for them to have a little crunch.   The build your own bacon burger was to die for! Once I tried it, I could see why most patrons prefer the burger. It had a distinctly grilled flavor and the toppings were fresh. I also loved the juxtaposition of having cold condiments. Similar to having warm syrup for your pancakes; it sets the dish apart.   Our waitress Kelly was awesome! She made us feel right at home from the moment we came in! She gave great menu suggestions and wanted to make sure we had a great time! Would definitely come here again.",

BRGR for the Kobe Beef and Burgatory for a Bison. Ended up at Wingharts one Friday around 4:30. Having never been there the boyfriend and I walked in and didn't know if we grabbed a table if they had servers or what. So, we plopped down and waiting a good amount of time. We finally wondered since it's a bar if we were supposed to order up at the front. Our waitress appeared from outside (possible smoke break?) and came over and greeted us with a big personality and lots of helpful advice. The menu with a combination of burgers and fries and pizza is a fat kids dream. She advised us to get a little bit of everything and that is exactly what we did.   We ordered a full Mattola Burger to split, fries and a Margherita pizza. What we got was a lot of food. Enough to take half the burger and some slices of pizza home. The pizzas themselves could be tackled by a hungry person. Not ridiculously large and would make a filling lunch.  The fries were delicious. I took a bite of the Burger and was in heaven. All the other burger places were good, but this one was just so well done and simple. The pizza was very good, fun to watch the guy toss the dough right behind the bar. The feta cheese made it salty and oh so good.   Our waitress informed us that they were planning on opening a southside location as well, which will be great. Working in the southside this addition would make an awesome lunch stop.   I was blown away and when I'd read how good it was, I didn't expect for it to be THAT good. Run there now!",

The first time I walked by this place I thought it was a tattoo parlor (strangely enough it has a similar vibe going on inside).   You order your burger (or other food item) at the register and then mostly fend for yourself for a place to sit and eat here.  The place is small but cozy and we ended up finding a spot at the bar.  The burger: it was very good, but overcooked (and not cooked over an open flame).  I got the Shipwreck burger (arugula, brie, bacon, caramelized onions, and TRUFFLE OIL).  I ordered mine medium rare and got something that more closely resembled medium well.  My fault for not sending it back, but I was hungry and didn't feel like waiting.  The combination was very nice - a nice bitter bite from the arugula, some earthy sweetness from the truffle oil, some gooey goodness from the brie, and a nice salty crunch from the bacon.  Everyone in our group (there were five of us) mentioned that they would definitely be back.  Would I be back? Yes, but not til the whiskey is flowing (they noted that they'd have liquor in about 2 weeks).    Conclusion: In my opinion, a 5 star burger joint needs to cook their burgers over open flames, PERIOD.  Til I find a spot like this in this city, the best burgers I've had in Pittsburgh have been cooked on my charcoal grill!!  I give them 3.75 stars (rounded to 4 since they're a new and budding place and also have future plans to serve whiskey!).",

It's fun to watch them patty and form the burgers right in front of you.  The rest of the burger menu is solid with some interesting innovations in toppings.  The beers are a well curated list of great brews.  OH! And don't forget the fries!  Life altering!",

    "text": "GREAT little dive-y burger bar located in a sea of restaurants the surround Market Square.  Definitely not the flashiest place on the block, but they serve up some killer burgers!  The main seating at this place is along the bar, which I'd highly recommend, as you can watch the cook fire up an array of beefy masterpieces.  I ordered the Shipwrecker--could I really resist brie, bacon, and white truffle aioli?  One of the best burger's I've had in a while--perfectly cooked to medium, great bun, and you could tell that the toppings were high quality.  Fries are also delicious, although I kind of wish I would have ordered a side of the aioli to dip them in!  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd for sure find a way to be a regular here!",

    "text": "Deafening volumes of chatter have been surrounding Winghart's and how they have supposedly created a burger that decimates all that have come before it.  No, kids. Tessaro's is still the Godburger and renders Winghart's Shipwreck burger into just that -- a wreck...a smoldering wreck. And I'm not sorry for saying so.   Cashing in my last 2 hours of personal time for the year, quittin' time came early on this wintry day, and with that, I seized upon an opportunity to finally shadow the doorstep of a place that can't figure out whether or not it is a diner or a hipster bar, and it tries SO hard, TOO hard --Winghart's is so hipster, it hurts worse than it would watching The Joy Formidable trying to...err...rock...at Wacken Open Air.  Now the Shipwreck wasn't completely duff. The meat was amply juicy, and the caramelized onions worked sugary/salty sorcery with the bacon. I barely noticed the argula and white truffle aioli, however, and the bun seemed stale, but what truly deflated the burger was the solid flap of brie, which was indolently, improperly unmelted (brie should ooze). De facto, the entire burger itself was served at a temperature that was close to lukewarm.   Let's compare: Tessaro's burger has a deep red center, even if it is cooked medium. Winghart's Shipwreck was ordered medium rare, yet had no pink inside. Tessaro's Godburger (my name for it) doesn't need gourmet accoutrements to be tasty. It is a burger for purists. You will taste the meat above all. Tessaro's doesn't offer different kinds of designer burgers, and there's nothing wrong with any of that at all. I love aioli and brie and argula and newfangled takes on traditional dishes, but when you add all of those haute components to any dish and treat those ingredients with disrespect, failure results. When I'm charged $12 ($23 was the total bill) for said failure, I'm insulted. Also, for a burger that evokes a colossal disaster, the Shipwreck is about the same size as a single at Wendy's, and honestly, I think the Redhead makes a better burger. Tessaro's is bigger than both of 'em, by the way.   It certainly looks nice when it's swaddled in paper, though. I suppose that's intended to be ironic. Hmph.   For a side (a la carte, no less), I tried Grandma Taiclet's Potato Salad, and all it did was make me thirsty and cause my lips to pucker. Grandma overdoes it with the salt and lemon juice. Tessaro's is fathoms better and comes WITH the burger.   Dessert was a catastrophe called The Hippy Cake. A twist on the funnel cake, Winghart's offers them 4 ways: 3 sweet and 1 savory. I tragically fell for Mariah's Kiss, and I can tell from locking mouths with her that Mariah needs to lay off the biris and hooch. I should have known that a bitter pill was on the horizon when I saw a portly, tattooed man straining in an attempt to emit batter into a fryer by strangling a squeeze bottle instead of, y'know, using a funnel? Rather than getting a spiderweb of hot-fat cooked pleasure, I got a much too large heap of fried driblets that were drowned in Hershey's syrup that in turn was overpowered by Grand Marnier or Frangelico (psst! alcohol=grown-up). All of that was topped with a \"housemade\" whipped cream that I mistook for vegetable shortening. Cool Whip would have been preferable.  Equally cruddy was the service. My \"waitress\" was so inept, flaky, inattentive, lethargic, aloof, and lacking in social skills, I didn't leave her a tip, and I rarely ever stiff servers (I wrestled with Scrooging her). When I came in, I was ignored while another server and some cooks/bartenders socialized with the cookie-cutter (central casting?) bohemians. I sat down, waited a few minutes, and walked back up through the narrow corridor to the counter to ask for a menu. A petite and perky young woman with an obvious fetish for Perestroika chic told me to seat myself, which I did, and after several more minutes went by, I was greeted by a mumbling, unfriendly ogress who was too busy singing along to the Pitchfork-approved playlist that was airing in the background to do her job. She didn't give me napkins (I had to grab some from the bar) and practically needed to be flagged down like a wayward bus a few times, especially when I wanted dessert (she was unaware that Winghart's makes them) and my final check (she must have wanted me to scram because she initially left me a bill with my meal without asking me if I wanted anything else). There was also an icy draft coming even when the door was closed (it was 35 degrees outside), and I was seated next to a refrigerator that several employees kept pulling out into the aisle. For some reason, firewood was being kept behind the fridge.    Gliding on fumes of hype, aesthetic, snark, and little more, Winghart's represents New Pittsburgh and is designed by those and for those who long to take bulldozers to Old Pittsburgh (Tessaro's).   P.S. My bill said \"one dude\" on it. Heh. Kewl.",

My wife and I both had burgers and we really enjoyed them.  Sitting at the bar we could see how much care was put into each burger, and it's those little things that make the burger, which in this case was great.  Our bartender was more than happy to give us a taste of any whiskey, and their draft beer selection was diverse and unique.    The only problem is the size of the restaurant.  It's so small, there really isn't a 4 person table or even room for one.  If you have more than 2 people you might want to stay away unless you get lucky and there is enough room at the bar for everyone to sit together.  I though will definitely be returning for another burger, however it won't be with a group.",

My boyfriend and I sat on the upstairs patio which was wonderful, it's a small patio so I bet it is hard to get a seat there on a pretty busy night.  We both ordered wings and Mac and cheese.  The wings and Mac and cheese were both good!  They weren't like the best I've had but I also did enjoy them.  We both had beers as well.  They had an interesting draft list, a lot of beers I had not had before.  Our server was good.  So yeah all and all a decent place!",

We would've walked right by if our Lyft didn't drop us at the door. Tiny place. Open kitchen (which I love because I'm so nosey). AMAZING food. My husband had the Nad-lee(?) burger which comes with a homemade pierogi on top and I had the OG Mac and cheese. We split some amazing fries as well. Our meal was Great with perfect portions. My Apple cider margarita with caramel and cinnamon and sugar on the rim of the glass was so good and his beer was great too. We may come back tomorrow for lunch. Try it out!

I opted for the \"I don't care, whatever\" burger with a chicken patty instead of beef. The burger was overall soggy and not what I was looking for in a burger. The fries saved the day, but I am averaging the two.",

It's topped with a beef sauce, Boursin cheese, fried onions, and a fried egg. It's a $15 burger and it's worth every penny. I get it on lettuce, without the bun, so it gets eaten with knife and fork.  I've only tried this burger, but others have said the shipwreck is also fantastic, which I think is their most popular burger.  The drinks are always well made, and in the summer it's really nice to sit outside on the balcony looking out into the city and market square.  Just a really great place and a super awesome burger.",

Was eager to try the Shipwrecked burger. Disappointed that the burgers don't come with fries since they are decently priced so my friend and I split Cajun fries.   The burger was huge and satisfying. There was a little too much bread for my liking. The Brie, carmelized onions, and truffle aioli were great. Was happy I could taste the truffle but the patty was alright. My friend who had the Margherita pizza said the sauce was very watery and did not enjoy her pizza. In addition, my other friend who ordered the French velveeta Mac and cheese said it was not very warm when it came out.   Overall, not a bad place but could definitely improve. With so many options in downtown, I don't know if I would come back.",

    "text": "Note: This review is for the pizza (and mac and cheese!), since I'm not a (beef) burger eater.  I came here in April with several friends before seeing a musical at the Byham.  None of us had been here before, but we came here based on the convenience and the good reviews.  I ordered the sweet Georgia Brown pizza, which has BBQ chicken, pineapple, red onion, and cheddar cheese.  It had an interesting sweet-savory flavor profile, and a nice crispy texture.  It was pretty good, as pizzas go, and definitely an interesting departure from typical pizza fare.  I recommend it.  One of my friends ordered the shipwrecked burger, and found it delicious, if a bit over-the-top fatty.  Another of my friends ordered the macaroni and cheese, per the waitress's recommendation, so I had to try it, as the resident mac and cheese connoisseur.  I wasn't expecting to be impressed, but the sauce, which was on the milder side, was surprisingly creamy and well-seasoned, and complemented the tenderness of the shell pasta nicely (score: 9.0).  If you go there, try it--this has to be the dark horse of mac and cheeses in PGH!  The atmosphere of this place is dark and kind of cave-like, with weird decor.  Like another reviewer, between the place's logo, the decor, and the waitress's \"uniform,\" I felt that it came off as trying a bit too hard to be hipster.  It definitely has character--though I don't know if it's quite the right type.  Service was fine--no problems there.  Overall, an interesting place worth trying if you happen to be downtown.",

I have always wanted to check this place out and this seemed like the perfect time.  We sat down and I ordered some of their high-end shots of whiskey.    The first one was called Yam... something (okay - I was having a good day and all I remember was that there were a lot of syllables) and it was very good.      I met the owner named \"Shipwreck\" and tried their topshelf whiskey.   It was very good - a hint of smoke but still very good.   I believe that was fate because I knew if I kept drinking those - I would be shipwrecked!  The burger was very good.   I told the gents cooking my food (they saw me taking a picture) that I was a Yelper.  This helped because my buddy Brett - wrote a review and was there prior to me getting there had a different experience.  Overall - I would recommend for beers / whiskey and a burger.     I will be back :-)  Food - Great!   I enjoyed by burger and fries. Service - Awesome - our server even tried to get my buddy a candle for his burger - that would have been funny Price - I can't really tell - I ordered some high end shots which skewed my bill.  I think the burgers were about $10...",

Two types of wings (Balsamic and Garlic were best - both were very crunchy, which I like; still feeling remorse over not ordering the Blacked & Bleus, so order them and let me live vicariously through you); pierogies (SO GOOD! MUST. GET.); burgers (LOVED the Shipwreck and heard rave reviews of the I Don't Care Whatever); great fries (get them topped with truffle oil) and we couldn't leave without a funnel cake (get cinnamon).

The place is VERY small in a shot gun style layout.  there is a counter with about 12 stools that overlook the food cooking and clean up area.  The clean up area is the cause for my less than five star rating. Stacks of plates and baskets being washed In Full view of customers is unappealing. While the washing is happening on my visit the dishwasher broke a glass.  This area is quite close to the food prep and cooking area it is concerning that glass can fly into the food.  Got to wonder about other cleanliness issues.  Lots of Craft Beers are offered. BUT NO Non-Alcohol beers.  I have run into this lack of selection at least three times at down town establishments.  Better to sell a NA beer than have a customer order water.  Customers don't drink for a umber of reasons. DUI, health, religious, restaurants need to consider this option .",

She answered our questions about beer and liquor perfectly, was friendly the whole time, and accommodated all requests.  The outside area upstairs was full when we arrived, so we sat at a high top that was a little cramped for 4 people to actually eat dinner on. We asked the waitress if we could put two tables together, and while she was perfectly happy to accommodate that, she also informed us that a party outside was closing out, and we could take their table in a few minutes. We did, and it was so nice to sit outside on such a beautiful day!  Winghart's menu is a hoot to read - you'll see what I mean when you get there. The owner definitely has a good sense of humor. 3 out of the 4 of us decided to have Colin's Orangutan, a burger with chicken sausage and some other goodies. We also ordered regular fries and seasoned fries to share. The burger was so delicious, and the fries were a great complement! Unfortunately, the seasoned fries were insanely over-seasoned. They were so salty, I thought we'd be committing suicide by eating them. I asked if we could change them to regular fries too, and that request was also granted! I wasn't kidding when I said they had excellent service.  This is a great place for scotch and whiskey drinkers, but I'm neither. And yet, I managed to find the perfect drink for me! If you like sweet and fruity drinks, I recommend Woodchuck's Fall Harvest Cider, which Winghart's has in bottles. It tastes like apple pie (yes! really!) and is amazing.  I'll definitely recommend Winghart's to my friends!",

Whenever someone says they're going to burgatory I immediately steer them towards Wingharts.  It's better, it's the same price, and the company is divine.   Sure, it's a little small but they serve whiskey, burgers, and pizza.  It's perfect for the man in anyone's life and prefect for a the lady if she's not a \"dainty\" eater.",

After flagging down the bartender and  ordering a new one, it was also extremely undercooked. He never even checked on me once the second one arrived, I had to  flag him down again. His excuse was, \"the cook was busy\". Not an acceptable  excuse for a 12$ burger with no sides I also ordered a martini, which was presented in a double shot glass. It tasted  meh.  The check was presented( after asking) in an odd format.. not broken down at all, just a total.    I will say the bathrooms are neat looking. To bad they were dirty when  I was there.  If you want a great burger I  highly suggest heading north of the city to Burgh'ers in Harmony.. they also make wonderful drinks there.",

Still, I find it necessary to post a few words to my fellow yelper's.  This place has ahhmazing burgers.  Everyone in our party preferred mid-rare, which after reading other reviews, we made a point to emphasize. They were cooked to perfection.  The bun was good enough to eat on it's own and the service was so warm and helpful.  Because we read some wildly disparate reviews on the fries, we had to give them a try.  Not surprisingly, our party shared the same disparate reviews.  I believe it's all about what you're looking for.  The fries are well cooked and crispy.  Also, a hint of sweetness prevails, which we attribute to sharing the fryer with the awesome funnel cakes?  Alas, I could not deduct a star when so many in our party loved them.  Give this place a try!",

With restaurants like Burgatory at the front of everyone's mouths when asked about the best burger in town (which I have been to and greatly enjoyed), I was taken aback when the Shipwrecked Burger at Winghart's literally gave me pause. You know that moment when you realize you have just bitten into something REALLY good? That was it.  The meat was cooked perfectly. Only seasoned enough to recognize that it was seasoned at all, the soft meat become smooth like a seared beef tartar. The bun was buttery and actually had body to it. All of the toppings (arugula, white truffle aioli, applewood smoked bacon [admittedly, EVERYONE has applewood smoked bacon], Brie and caramelized onions) went perfectly together. And the hand cut friends with the mystery salt! I asked one of the girls there about it, and she said the owners won't tell them what kind of salt it is. I've never used salt as a talking point about French fries, but it makes a huge difference.  I have been back several times since that epic first dining experience, and can also speak well for the Tallulah Hula Burger and the I Don't Care, Whatever Burger.  Overall, I love to pseudo-punk rock atmosphere of the place. They have a great beer selection every time I go. Great whiskey/bourbon/scotch selection. The food is pretty reasonably priced, on top of that.  Wingharts can give Burgatory a run for their money.  GO TO WINGHARTS!",

This place makes, nay creates specialty burgers and wood fired pizzas.  From the fresh ground beef to the house made aioles and sauces everything is excellent.  You order as you enter and we were fortunate to get a couple of stools at the bar, front row seats! We split an order of chili cheese fries that were beyond compare with any I've had before.  The fries weren't just good, they were perfect.  The last fries were still crunchy and warm.  The beef burger was great and you can even swap the beef for chicken or veggie, although I don't know why. We also has the privilege to sit in front of Shipwreck, the captain of the orders.  He loves what he is doing and does it very well.  One of the burgers is named for him.  Great place, great people, superb food!",

The people who work here are incredible, each having an alter ego name that they give to patrons that come into the bar. It was definitely my type of people, very hip and alternative and laid back. The menu is actually good bar food, but a drawback is that I remember their kitchen closing pretty early (maybe 9 or so). The first few times I stopped in I had just missed the cutoff and had to drink my dinner. However, the drinks are very good, made strong, also a pretty good beer selection. The actual bar actually isn't spacious or particularly amazingly decorated, but they have since opened up the upstairs and it's great with more tables, another bar, and I believe even a patio overlooking Market Square. The reason to go here is the people who work there who all get along great with each other and just are there to have a good time. They now know me when I walk in (as my alter ego) and act really happy to see me (whether that's True or not). And that's what we all want when we go out, right? The food and decor of a place are obviously important, but having a good time and enjoying an experience is about the people you interact with- and that's why I have no qualms about giving them a 5-star rating.",

The burgers were cooked to our specification, toppings were fresh and the patties were of generous size and soooo juicy.  Our server checked in with us regularly but inconspicuously so as to not be overbearing.  Others around us were eating items other than burgers and clearly enjoying their food.  I highly recommend Winghart if you're not inclined to hit Burgatory-in fact we recommend Winghart over that place for many reasons including:  great table service, specialty cocktails, extensive beer list and menu items that offer something for everyone.",

Medium should have a pink center. It did. Medium rare should have a warm red center - it did. I am completely over places that try to sound cute and trendy by offering \"pink\" and \"no pink\" as the temperatures on their burgers. That is not cute, it is not helpful - it is a worthless binary scale.   If this place can get it right, in the low light and with all the toppings and add-ons, everyone should be able to do it.

    "text": "We were looking forward to topping several days spent on the Allegheny Passage with the special Winghart dining experience that we have so come to love! Sadly, we departed hastily before even sitting down in an attempt to preserve the halo of good karma from our bike trip.   Now, I understand the Sunday of Labor Day weekend might have been understaffed and that the on-duty staff  was overworked.... (not sure why large dinner crowds this weekend were unanticipated by management) But, allow me to describe what happened. Downstairs was not overcrowded, but we hoped to find seating upstairs cause we like the atmosphere. The bar was full, so we headed towards the door to the outside seating area. Here our path was blocked by a chef (on duty? off-duty ? But in full chef garb) with a look of concern on his face. \"You probably don't want to sit up here at all\" he said concernedly.  \"We only have one person on staff up here, and they are under!\" Now normally, such a warning would have been appreciated. But the next thing that happens is right beside me an unhinged bartender is maniacally imploring a friend at a table to \"Please shoot me in the face, Shoot me in the face!\" \" I can't handle it anymore!\"  Now that's a buzz kill, totally stressed me out. As we made our way downstairs a drunken patron sarcastically said \"why you leaving? Don't like the music?\" We are repeat customers and have always enjoyed the food here, but service is fully at least half of the equation and have seen the staff at times slacking in the service area.  This was one epic meltdown, but come on staff and management, Man Up! Until they fix this problem it's going to be hard to recommend winghart's without a precautionary tale.",

The bar was quiet at first but it quickly got busy and you could tell Admiral was a bit overwhelmed. We had a great time and we really enjoyed our food, I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try some fo the other burgers on the menu.",

The beer selection was good.  My friend got the burger and it was HUGE.  The fries homemade. The space is small but adequate and their soundtrack made for a great dining experience.  I would definately go here again.",

All the toppings on the veggie burger were delicious and worked well together, but my burger was SALTY. I don't know why every place that makes a veggie burger thinks that the way to make it flavorful is to pack it full of salt. Props for having it on the menu and including some very fresh and delicious toppings, but I just can't get over how the salt overpowered any other flavor in my meal.",

And yet? When we talk in my house about the best burgers we've had in Pittsburgh, we talk about Winghart's. The burgers are tasty, full of flavor and they're only the beginning of the menu: I am still a sucker for the Pittsburgh salad, complete with fries, so that's what I had (in addition to several bites of a Hula Burger).  You might think about going somewhere else that's easier to get to or has a table waiting: don't settle. It's worth it.",

    "text": "Ok, no seriously, this isn't hype, it's love.  For months I have heard about Winghart's and their burgers.  So finally I have a chance at checking it out myself and it was pretty flipping sweet.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by the SUPER friendly wait staff.  I didn't even need a menu since I had checked them out, I wanted the Shipwreck burger.  Shipwreck was there and he came over and talked to us while our burgers cooked.  Now here's how I knew I was blown right out of my body.  Mid-conversation the cook placed the burger basket in front of me and I went for my first bite.  All I remember is Linda W. and Shipwreck continuing the conversation while my entire world came to a screeching halt.  Out of nowhere all of my senses converged around an explosion of flavors and textures that only happen once in a blue moon.  Yes folks.  It was that good.  I mean, in hindsight I probably looked funny.  There I was mid conversation all lively and attentive and then the next thing you know it is taking every ounce of self control from taking more bites before properly chewing and eating the bite I had already taken.  Like seriously in my head ... I could have jumped into a pool filled with Shipwreck burgers and wrestled for a world title. (Yes the visuals are ridiculously disturbing...but it was that much of a positive assault on my synapses).  Ok.  So onto the objective portion of the review:  the burger was excellent quality.  The cheese (brie) was properly melted and tasted like a high quality brie should.  The caramelized onions were sublime, perfectly browned and sweet.  The bun was warmed and soft.  The bacon was savory and chewy (not a fan of burnt bacon) and the hamburger itself ... that's darn good meat.  Overall each of the flavors played with each other and took their turns playing with the palate.  The burger cooked medium well was closer to medium than well done (kudos to the cook!) so the juices were still flowing which added to the desire of eating faster since the messiness was OH SO GOOD.  In addition to the burger I got to try their fries which were also yummy good.  Peanut Oil made for awesome fried texture and the sugar(at some point in the preparation) gave the sweet salty combo that made this fries (still tasking like fries should) have a unique taste.  Almost like a distant cousin of sweet potato fries ... just still clearly potatoes.  I can't wait to go back and try a different burger.  I'll have to force myself to do so and also try their pizzas.  This is easily one of those situations where the tempting to sticking to the same rapturous meal might be too strong, haha.",

To say it's small is an understatement. It's quite divey, which I don't mind, but just wasn't expecting. I am not a fan of paper plates or plastic utensils unless I am on a picnic. But enough about the negative. The wait staff was friendly, which is always a plus. I ordered a bacon cheese burger and fries. The burger was extremely juicy but not as flavorful as I had hoped. The fries were right on target for me. Overall, it wasn't the best burger, but it definately wasn't the worst.",

Walked into the place with a guy up front telling me to sit where ever, which seems pretty normal.  After 10-12 mins of sitting there expecting the guy to come take my order, he never came.  A nice waitresses took notice and told the guy I need to be waited on, but 5 mins later ... the guys is still no show.   17-18 mins of sitting at the bar, no one even took my drink order or even gave me a menu.  Can't be that hard to figure out one of the three parties at the bar have not been served   And yes I knew the exact time, because I didn't have anything to do besides fiddling around on my phone the entire time.   Step up your game Wingharts!!!  It will be a Very VERY long time till I go back again and only because of the good beer selection and good food.  Should you find yourself there, and potentially a different  person at the front, I am sure you will have a pleasant experience.",

It's a wonder no one ever got sick because of this unsanitary habit. I thought gloves were in necessity when you touch people's food. Always watch what cooks are doing with your food if you can.

It's a good spot to grab some drinks and food bar food with good company.   The menu is pretty extensive for this bar lounge/restaurant.

My one complaint is that it had a ton of BBQ sauce on it; I should've asked for just a drizzle of it. My boyfriend made his own burger and then we split some fries.  And wow. It was a ton of food. Our original plan was to split a pizza and fries but he decided to try a burger. In the future, I think we'll split something because this was so much food. Definitely worth the price in my opinion.",

I felt like I was spackling the inside of my arteries with this stuff. The service was good. They cook everything in front of you at the bar and the cooks looked like they were having fun.",

The only complaint is the server was a little rude when he asked my party of 3 to move from a table of 5 when we were told to go upstairs and seat ourselves. If there was an off limited seating area, the employees should've told us or they should've seated us. Other than that, we'd definitely eat there again & again. You won't be disappointed",

    "text": "Undoubtedly, Winghart's serves the best burger in Pittsburgh that I've tried so far. They accomplish this feat very simply: quality meat, fresh ingredients, cooked to your specifications.   The focus of Winghart's menu is pizza and burgers, so I decided to take advantage of the fresh pizza ingredients and the house grounded meat by ordering a medium rare burger with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and fresh basil. The burger was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. My friend - who never finishes his food - ordered a Market Square burger and finished the whole burger. Being overly picky, I thought the bottom bun was a bit too thick, but, in defense, the burgers are very juicy and need strong, absorbent support.  The ambiance of the bar is warm and compact. There is an open kitchen which you can sit right in front of and watch the chef prepare the food. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Personally, I enjoyed the Indie Pop music (e.g. Neon Trees, Phoenix) played, yet (if Indie Pop is not your genre) the music is not abrasively loud and it unnoticeable if you're conversing.",

This is also a great location with patio seating on the square, or relaxing 2nd floor patio seating overlooking market square. Plenty of bar seating to be had as well. In addition to my burger, had the artichoke dip as the starter -- which came with really, really great pita bread. (Warm, too -- really enjoyed this part of it). 5 star pita bread. The artichoke dip was a creamier version -- which isn't my favorite, but still solid. 3 stars on the dip. My friend had some boneless wings that came with aioli, which could be a great appetizer or small meal. I'd just ask for the aioli on the side, as it's fairly substantial.",

Winghart's had a chicken sandwich and vegetarian sandwich as their offerings for the promotion. When I went to pick up my sandwich twenty min later, the woman who acknowledged me (short brown hair wearing a lacy cap over her head) said they canceled all their Ritual orders due to being busy and to contact Ritual for a refund because \"our in-store customers are more important than the $1 Ritual app orders\". I told them I waited twenty min and nobody contacted me in that time. The cooks were right behind her and offered to make my sandwich in ten minutes. So I agreed to wait and sat at one of their tables outside, where the woman who greeted me was constantly waiting on other customers. 15 min later I go back in and the cooks look confused. The woman comes in from outside and tried to find the sandwich and nobody seems to know what's going on or what to say. The woman said she thought I left- though I was barely 10 ft away from her and clearly agreed to wait. With bright purple hair, I'm hard to miss, and I never moved from that spot. I enjoyed the food before but I will NEVER be one of their in-store customers again. This restaurant should not have signed up on the app if they value the business they get from it so little and treat customers using it like they don't matter. She wasn't even apologetic until I complained a lot. I'm telling everyone in my office and neighboring offices in my company about the experience as well.",

    "text": "I actually would like to return to this place but it seemed a lot like a college hangout and less appropriate for a restaurant in Market Square, in my experience. The prices for food are reasonable and drinks, as well, but the service and the um...attire we will say, left something to be desired.   Three of us enjoyed a delicious birthday dinner for my fiance who loved his mac and cheese topped with bacon. I specifically picked this place based on their menu and we weren't disappointed. What I was disappointed in was the bartenders lack of care for our dining recommendations. Two of us purchased burgers but didn't explain they were a la carte, so we ordered fries after we were delivered the burgers. My burger was ordered without a bun and there was no presentation, or tomato, either. We also were not give set-ups and had to take forks and knives from mason jars sitting next to the bar. Once the food was delivered, the bartender NEVER came back to check on us while we were eating and we had to ask for our checks. He was very non-attentive and I am not sure if they were understaffed or he was just busy but with a full bar he didn't need to also have four other tables.   I will say, the bartender was the best dressed employee we saw in a nice button down shirt. While I am all for casual dress, as I get to do at work, some things are just not appropriate for a customer oriented position. The yoga pants on the server were meant to impress some I am sure, but the sagging jeans showing blue boxer shorts on the bussers? They were literally sitting just above his crotch. I am curious why a restaurant as such doesn't have a dress code to perhaps keep the bodies of their employees a little less revealed to people who otherwise don't care to see the ass of the server and busser.   Call me a 40-something overly sensitive whatever you want, but I worked in the industry for 19 years and some things stand out to customers; these are the things that stood out to me. I think this place could have easily gotten 5 stars from me had they just made a little more effort to be professional and treat us as the customers and adults we were. Nice try, but not quite.",

When I first heard the name I was expecting a wing stop type of place that was essentially fast food but was pleasantly surprised with the selection on the menu. For a quick summary I'd say casual and fairly priced comfort food. I had a burger and split some wings as an appetizer. The food and service were good and I would return to try other things or reorder what I had. They give you a fair portion of fries with the meal and it tastes fresh.

And the bathroom downstairs is in the corner by some tables as well as being outdated and sort of falling apart.   Not sure I'd want to sit at those tables so close to the toilet.  However.  Adds to its charm.   The server was very friendly and remembered the orders well.   We ordered (well I did as my amazing other half was in the bathroom hehe) the same burger (mattola)- medium with an egg over easy and mayo.  The egg did not come back over easy, it was simply fried hard.  No big deal.   The burgers not medium but they were juicy and flavorful also not a big deal.   They seemed to be hand formed patties.  We ordered pierogies with sour cream and chives as well as the fried pickles.   Pierogies lacked filling but they were flavorful and tasty.  Pickles were a light batter and were quite delicious.   We would go here again to try some other stuff for sure.",

I've been a huge fan of Winghart's in Market Square where it all began for this little beefy enterprise. I still love the small artsy dive vibe going on here but they have got to step it up in the cleanliness and decor burger lane and pay more attention to their customers.  It's just too laid back anymore.  They couldn't be bothered repairing the stuffing oozing out of the chairs, wiping down the table, or cleaning the walls.  It was sort of gross, to be honest, because burgers are such a \"roll up your sleeves and dig right in\" kind of food.  You don't want to feel dirty table while enjoying your delicious burger.  It takes something away from the experience.    Draft beer list is still killer and the burgers were good but the fries were waaaaaaay overdone crispy husks of former potato glory.  Thank God for Heinz ketchup. C'mon Winghart's, get back in the game.",

    "text": "After a Pitt victory during Family Weekend, we took our daughter's roommate and her parents out for a casual, fun dinner.  Everyone wanted red meat...so we pooled our collective foodie knowledge and chose to give Winghart's a try.  Everyone settled in over their mixed drinks.  They have a really cool bar set-up (upstairs...see the picture attached) and I had a most unusual beer with flavors of banana and caramel.  My family loves wings and we'd heard their are pretty rock star, so we ordered a traditional Buffalo style plate.  The traditional \"mighty\" Buffalo wings (as they call 'em) were absolutely delicious with a crispy skin and hot / moist inside with a perfect heat to the sauce.  Add a nice cooldown with the bleu cheese dressing on the side and we are nearing perfection.  On to the burgers!  The Market Square burger was cooked a perfect medium-rare and served with gruyere cheese, sauteed mushrooms, bacon and a honey mustard dressing...was a bit too sweet for my tastes but a good burger nonetheless.  The Denny Double Blue cheese burger had two different kinds of cheese...a creamy bleu cheese (dressing) and dry crumbled bleu...it was my favorite of the two burgers we sampled.  My daughters each ordered a plate of pierogies.  The Lucy's original pierogis were slightly crisp on the outside and filled with delicious, creamy potatoes and served with chive sour cream.    Lastly, the dude ranch fries were heavily seasoned (which I did not mind, but my wife frowned upon) and served with a side of ranch dressing for dipping.  The fries were cooked perfectly, and who doesn't order fries with a burger, huh?!?!?  A great meal, funky atmosphere and an attentive bunch of servers led to a very enjoyable family evening.",

I've never understood why so many restaurants close their kitchens in such a sports oriented city where most games don't end until 10-10:30pm. Winghart's you are the real MVP for still offering great food after midnight.  I'm so glad we came here this past Saturday. I split wings with my boyfriend and they were AMAZING. Perfect size and great flavor on the Parm Ranch. Also, loved the ACE Pineapple Cider, which I've never had before. We were seated upstairs (downstairs had closed for the night). I loved the upstairs super intimate with not as much space. Very cool vibe.  I will be back.",

    "text": "We've been to Winghart's a few times and each time they provide a decent meal.  This time, we went for lunch.  I opted for the RazzyFresh beverage while the hubby got a beer.  The RazzyFresh was refreshing, but after receiving the food, I realized it wasn't the best option.  It was a mixture of raspberry, mint and rum.  The mint was pretty overwhelming and when trying to drink it with my lunch it felt as though I was brushing my teeth while eating.  As for the food, I ordered the Garlic Parm wings with ranch dressing and an order of fries.  The hubby ordered the margarita pizza.  I had never tried their wings until today and they were fantastic!  Very crispy and flavorful.  I wasn't impressed with the fries.  They were all tiny pieces like we got the bottom of a bag.  The pizza was pretty good.  I'm more of a traditional New York pizza gal, so I'm more impressed with a good crust.  The pizza was a very thin crust, but was cooked well and the toppings were fresh and flavorful.  Pros: The food is good They are fairly consistent in terms of taste and quality The service is top notch The location is nice in a quiet section of Market Square The second floor outdoor seating is a unique view of Market Square  Cons: The drinks are a bit pricey The food is a bit pricey for the type of food you're ordering Parking can be difficult because, well, it's downtown, so, yeah (All of the cons are kinda expected from a Market Square joint)  Essentially, it's not our favorite spot, even in Market Square.  But it's a solid place to get a quick meal and a drink with friendly service.",

    "text": "Of all the burgers I've had in Pittsburgh, this one is probably the best. A side by side taste test would probably prove so. The burgers are juicy, the meat is so good, and something about that bread. Oh and the delicious creations they make. I think they have about 6 different burgers on the menu, which may seem like much less than other burger joints in town. I have had 3 of the 6 and they are all so freaking delicious. The Shipwreck (namesake of the manager) is crazy good... with truffle aioli and gruyere cheese. Mouthwatering. The fries are pretty awesome too, fresh cut, and always crispy. It's a pretty good atmosphere for the restaurant's purpose. Being a burger joint in downtown, I would assume most business is for lunch. It is always packed, with a line out the door. If you can find a seat at the bar the over looks the kitchen, you get your burger handed to you wrapped in paper. No plates, eat yer meat, have some friendly conversation with the manager, and get on back to work or use your time to walk around the city. Take-out is a popular option there, as food is ready fairly quickly (unless you are one of those jerks that likes your delicious fresh ground meat burger well-done). The people who work there are always friendly... willing to joke and talk if you do find a seat at their bar. I wouldn't recommend a large group outing to stop here, unless your doing take-out... and avoid going right at 12:30 if ya want a seat for lunch.",

Now, I promise to go back and re-review once the liquor license clears but Really?! To be fair, maybe I should have read some of the other reviews first and planned accordingly  b/c they are byob friendly until they become a licensed liquor provider.. Finally, I understand making you order up front during the lunch rush but I think they should take orders at the bar after five pm. It's just a little weird. The burger I had was quite good but by no means  the best in town (for that try brgr or burgatory). And the fries were super crispy. This is a personal preference thing but I dream about perfect fries all day and they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you added a good whiskey list (in the works) and the ability to order from any point along the bar, I'd probably give it four stars..",

    "text": "I have never really taken the time to write a review about anything. . . .  until now. My fiance and I went to Winghart's last night in Market Square.  I don't even like burgers as I very rarely (and I mean maybe once a year) eat red meat, but I got one nonetheless. Not only was it the best burger I have ever had, it was the best thing in general I've ever had.  Like EVER.  I had dreams about that burger last night and my mouth is watering as I write this review just thinking about it.  I ate the ENTIRE thing and it was worth every single calorie.  The fries were also out of this world.  Totally fresh and hot and perfectly seasoned.  I am telling you - you will not be able to find a better hamburger than this anywhere (and I am from South Texas so I know a thing or two about burgers).  My fiance agrees.  The staff is so cool and friendly, which made the experience even better. We sat at the bar to watch the hockey game so we got to see the chefs make all the food in this amazing brick fired oven.  It is a total hole in the wall dive, but it's okay because the food is so good you don't even notice. I cannot wait to go back.   I had the shipwrecked burger last night.  The chefs also said the pizza is amazing.  I don't know what to get next!  I would give this place 10 stars if I could! If you are craving a good burger this place is a MUST!!",

We hesitated but decided to stay because we heard good things about the burgers. Well the waitress was polite...but the rest was downhill.  We ordered 2 burgers, fries, chili, salad.  First the waitress says we are out of wheat buns then they are out of pickles. Next she completely forgets to order the salad. They were out of the beer I asked for and then returned to tell me about to other beers they were out of. Then she never tells us they are out of chili, the cook eventually does.  This was after we watched them serve a bowl to someone else...thank god they chose not to serve to us, it was so dried up it looked like a bowl of re fried beans.  Then we get our burgers, the bun was so soggy and disintegrated. My husband did not ask for ketchup and his burger was covered in it.  The burger itself Was average.  The fries were good. I think there are better places to go for a good burger.",

So we are seated in the way back by the bathroom  Would be okay, except that I can SMELL that urinal cake smell from the bathroom.  I get that they need to seat people back there, but they have to keep it CLEAN.  I am smelling bathroom odors and my husband is smelling garbage odors from the trash can right next to us that is OVERFLOWING with garbage.  Seriously?  There is garbage on the floor right next to where we are seated.  Between these two things, we considered leaving, but we thought the people next to us were going to be leaving soon, and we figured we could grab their seats.  I got a whiskey, and it was seriously a much, much smaller pour than I've gotten in the past.  I didn't love our waitress.  She mixed up my order with my husband's.  (I ordered my burger medium rare and got it medium well, and his medium well burger was served to him medium rare.)  She came to check on us, but obviously didn't care what the answer was, because my  husband's answer of, \"Good, except....\" was cut off promptly as she walked away.  I love sitting at the bar, and I love their burgers, but to sit in the back with the servers was painful!  Oh, and leaves of lettuce had fallen out of the refrigerator that is right there in the table area, and I watched the servers walk past them about ten times without sweeping anything up.  It was just one of our worst restaurant experiences in a while, and it was really disappointing and icky.",

    "text": "The only reason I gave this place the rating I did was the fact the Tattonka Buffalo Chicken Sausage pizza was excellent!  The blue cheese was not over powering and it savored just the right amount of spicy tangy aftertaste.  This place lost points because of the price and poor customer service.  I didn't care that there was a very small seating area.  You go to NYC, sit in a cubby hole, pay $600 for a two person meal, and they give the place rave reviews.  The price isn't that bad, but its right at that border of \"being too much for the food\".  The poor customer service comes from the fact that I snapped a phone photo of the front open kitchen.  I was going to send it to friends and make dinner plans.  The skinny bearded cook came over and wanted know why I took the picture.  When I explained he tersely replied to the effect, \"someone asks permission first!\"  I really became uncomfortable after that.  Hello!  If that was an offense, what the hell are you doing in an open- counter kitchen, where all of the kitchen's actions are on display?  I have managed the business operations of five different restaurants.  I also, meet with PRA.  So trust me when I rhetorically ask, \"If this is the level of their customer service, I will be surprised if this one beats the odds!\" I won't be back.",

The place is very dive-y, kinda rundown looking, not a lot of light, but everything was clean. Pierogies..... they are ridiculously yummy and homemade. The dough was so chewy and thick and the filling was very flavorful. I got their version of a Greek salad. I'm lazy so the fact that everything was cut up into bite sizes made me happy. My husband got a burger, ordered medium well. Most places can't figure out how to cook a burger that way, but they nailed it. We were very happy with the speed and quality of everything. Plus, it's locally owned so that is a plus. I say, walk past Primanti and hit this joint up, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Again, I reiterate there aren't many places to go to before 11am for brunch or cocktails in the fine city of Pittsburgh. Which, unfortunately was exactly what we wanted at around 10am on a Friday. We finally trudged around and noticed that Winghart's was open at 11am and went upstairs knowing we only wanted cocktails after eating crumby bagels at Au Bon. We were the first ones there. I am not ashamed in the slightest after we jokingly laughed and said we wanted brunch and couldn't find it.   This place though isn't anything fancy but they do serve up some mean fancy whiskey cocktails! A few martinis and vodka fruity things to boot but this is definitely a whiskey bar as advertised. I can't remember the name of my cocktail but it involved copious amounts of Knob Creek, a little simple syrup, lemonade mixer and a squirt of soda water. My sister stuck with a whiskey, orange juice, grapefruit concoction and it was delicious. We were both set with perfect morning cocktails. In the background they had 16 Candles playing and the bartender was pretty friendly and jovial. The prices of drinks? Kind of meh. They were $9 or $10 a bit more than I expected for Pittsburgh about right I expect for New York. But I wasn't disappointed. They apparently serve a wide range of burgers, pizzas, and salads that we didn't take advantage of. But the Shipwreck with brie, caramelized onions, arugula, bacon and white truffle oil sounds pretty out of this world. There are also burgers with fries on them, which I'm not shocked by at all. There isn't anything much better than burgers and bourbon on a Friday morning and not being at work. So this place gets two thumbs up.",

    "text": "So we arrived Friday night in Pittsburgh from Richmond, VA.  After dropping our stuff off at the hotel we decided to venture out for a quick dinner.  Based on reviews, I chose this restaurant.  Super cool interior and I liked that they had two floors, both with outdoor patios out front.  It was located in the market square area which was pretty cool as well.  Service was attentive and friendly. So we got two orders of the fries (should have just gotten one to share because there was plenty in one).  We got the truffle one and the cajun one.  Both were great, but that truffle, omg, wow.  Yes, can I haz that errday!!!  So good!  Now to the burgers.  Meh, I really was hoping for something good here based on the reviews.  And maybe I'm spoiled coming from Richmond where we have alot of amazing food choices, and literally the best burger I have ever had with truffle mushrooms mixed in (Brux'l Cafe Truffle Burger is MY JAM!)  So, suffice to say, the burgers weren't that great, they were just okay.  Basically, not good enough to return for the burger, but for those fries I would!  What could they do to improve?  Honestly, the bread wasn't very good.  It wasn't fluffly and light.  It was stale.  Also, the meat on the burger just wasn't flavorful.  I get my burgers pretty much plain with some veggies on it because I WANT to taste the meat.  I am always looking for a good burger.",

Burger was OK, but undercooked per my me dwell request. Fries were fine. Same for beer.  Sat on balcony looking over Pittsburg's Market Square. Was a fine later summer day, on a Monday at 4:30. Was about 10 people inside.  OK, let's be honest, the place could use a little TLC and is something of a hole-in-the-wall, fit snugly between a Subway and Starbucks.     I think the value is OK, but don't know if I would come back.",

Here's what I didn't want to notice but noticed while dining at Wingharts.   The music that was being played was coming out of a visible iphone that was hooked up to a juke box.  One of the high top tables was stabilized by two dish rags folded and propped under the table legs.  We all jerry -rigg from time to time.   But I expect more from a resturant that sales $9.00 bugers. Moving on there were some horrific looking paintings on the walls. One which reminded me of the movie the Ring.   Yes  the shipwreck burger was delicious.  The pizza I got was not so great. While the toppings were good and the crust was warm the artichoke paste that was spread on it was only slightly cool.  The crust of my pizza did nothing to heat the artichoke paste. That was very distracting. So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5?   I really wanted a meal I could sink my teeth into but that's not what I got. It's probably my own fault for going to a buger joint and getting a pizza.",

It was a tough choice but I had the \"Harper's Fairly Good Burger\" cooked medium. It has Boursin cheese, bordelaise sauce, fried onion straws, and bacon, topped with an over easy egg. As delicious as it sounds.   I had read the Yelp reviews before walking the 1/2 mile from the hotel and was torn between the original fries or the 3 cheese Mac & Cheese with Whiskey so I got both. It was clear that the fries were fresh cut. The Mac & Cheese was SINFUL!   I sat directly across from the grill. The extremely friendly staff made certain that everything was perfect. They took pride in everything they did.   I can't tell you if they had dessert or not. I was so damn full I didn't ask and enjoyed the much needed walk back to the hotel.  I highly recommend and will definitely return if I find myself in Pittsburgh again.",

He thought that it needed more pineapple and onions while I thought that it needed less soggy bread.  That wasn't what we were impressed with though, we were impressed with the sample of the market square burger that we received on the way in. That and the fries. I'd bury myself in a mountain of those fries.  The market square burger had a perfect ratio of juicy steak to molten gruyere cheese. Even the bread had a sense of substantiality. It wasn't one of those wimpy little sesame seed buns that you get at Mcdonalds - this was the real deal. I would probably eat the bread of the burger by itself and be happy.   The service was okay, they seemed a little understaffed for how many people were there and the water was incredibly sketchy. It had a really weird taste to it, I don't know whether or not it as the cup (which had weird red-orange tinges on the bottom) or if it was a problem with the tap, but I was sufficiently scared.",

    "text": "I only have two complaints about this Winghart's. First, be prepared to smell like a delicious burger when you leave. Second, location. Market Square is just such a pain to deal with sometimes...especially when all I want is a burger! Ha.  Overall, Winghart's is currently my favorite burger joint in Pittsburgh, and this location is definitely the best of their options. While it's a little cramped and you feel like you're practically working in the kitchen thanks to the narrow layout and intimate setup, the food here is simply superior and more consistent than their Southside location.  Our last visit also showed us that the menu has finally expanded quite a bit. My favorite is the Shipwreck burger. It's filthy in all of the right ways, with it's white truffle aioli, brie, bacon, caramelized onions and arugula. If you're not a huge fan of red meat, as I try to avoid at times, you can get the The Boomer pizza. All of the same toppings, sans-meat, on pizza dough. An excellent alternative packed full of flavor!  I actually strayed last time and went for the Collin's Orangutan with chicken sausage, green apple, smoked gouda,caramelized onions and bacon. Yes, it's as excellent as it sounds.  I've tried their margherita pizza a few times as well. Simple, but well-executed. Good fries. Good chili. Good people.   Overall, with good service, a nice whiskey list, decent beer choices, and excellent food, there's absolutely no reason for me to not recommend Winghart's. Of course, with such limited seating, you might want to keep those recommendations to minimum, or your seat will be taken and you'll be left standing by the door drooling. Luckily, they've recently added more seating upstairs, too! Cheers!",

Winghart's provides excellent food and a great drink selection. There are plenty of friendly food options too which is refreshing. The wait staff are nice and, if you sit indoors, your meal is cooked right in front of you for full transparency in their health and safety quality. Be warned, the oil used to fry their food is peanut oil. However, plenty of menu items are not fried.   To be specific, the impossible burger looked very plain, but it had a tasteful amount of sauce and toppings. Burgers do not come with anything, so sides must be ordered separately. The fries, however, were excellent and the chicken on the wings were high quality as you'd expect. Overall, I definitely would recommend Winghart's to anybody!",

He was our bartender/ server who was literally the nicest and most attentive person I've experienced at a restaurant. Tipping him well, didn't feel good enough because he was so kind.   We came in before closing and he let us know the kitchen was closing early because it was a slow night. We were disappointed because the menu looked great. We let him know we were from out of town and asked if we could get some suggestions on where to grab a bite. When he found out we were from out of town; his face changed with compassion. He told us to have a seat and order what we wanted. He felt bad sending us away due to the kitchen trying to close. We thanked him and sat down.   We ordered: shipwreck chicks sandwich, truffle aioli fries, tikka masala( Punjabi) Mac and whiskey bbq boneless wings.  Everything was absolutely delicious. Especially the Mac, if you like Indian food.. you'd love this. I only took a bite of my boyfriends sandwich, but it was tender and flavorful.   The food was a great late night indulgence. However, I'm still very much shocked at Chris's act of kindness. He petitioned the kitchen to make our food even though he said they would likely be irritated at him. Then, he apologized if he was \"off-putting\" by telling us the kitchen was closed. Chris! You didn't need to apologize. You were great. You made awesome suggestions and most of all treated my boyfriend and I with exceptional kindness!",

When we started there were 3 of us, and by the time we left their were 9, but our server and staff were super patient with us and added another table and chairs, which we greatly appreciate. We sat at their little outdoor seating area in front, and had a great time. We ordered some hummus, their version of buffalo dip, and Pierogies for an app...all delicious! All of the dinners looked great too. I got the Carson street chicken sandwich and I think I finished it in about 3 seconds. I also kept stealing bites out of my friends funnel cake. It was huge and homemade, soooo good. It was a much needed night out and Winghart's made the experience so much better. I can't wait for another night out there and can't say enough good things about our experience.",

Everything on the menu looked so good, but I wanted to try on a burger on my first trip. Next time I go (and I'll definitely be back) I must try the wings and pizza! We got the sriracha fries pickles, and mannnn were they good!! Highly recommend!! 6 pickle spears for $6! The husband got the double matolla burger and ate the whole thing! I got the ship wreck burger that had gooey melted Brie cheese, caramelized onions, and mushrooms, with a truffle aioli and it was delicious!! We also got a basket of fries to share. One basket is enough for 2-3 people and only $4-5.  The service was fantastic. It got super busy on a Saturday night, and the servers and bussers were running their tails off. This location is super small; I wouldn't recommend coming with a large group. Most of the tables only sit 2. I didn't go upstairs though so I can't speak for the seats up there.  Wingharts is a total win. I can't wait to go back!",

But it just didnt seem to go with the mac. Idk, I wish I wouldn't of talked him out of the wings. The marsala would have been perfect on the wings. Darn it.  I had the Shipwreck without the onions. It had brie, white truffle aioli and bacon. Honestly,  it just lacked any sort of flavor.   I might come back to drink and try the wings. Other than that I dont see myself ever needing to come here.",

    "text": "There must be something about living in Pittsburgh that draws you to a sandwich that has both slaw and fries on it.  It's like you become trained to seek out something like this.  I didn't even look at any other burger on the menu because it's like my brain overrode everything else and I put the menu down.  Burgers are cooked to your liking and you will be asked that when you place your order.  I got mine medium well and I was satisfied.  This burger came out with a nice coating of melted cheese, kind of locking in that flavor that screams burger.  The slaw wasn't too tangy at all, it was more sweet than anything.  And those fries, oh my god, they added a nice crispiness to this thing.  Each bite was amazing.  Just so you know, the burgers do not come with a side.  So if you want a full meal, it is going to cost you a little bit more.  The burgers by themselves are a bit pricey.  I only had a burger here and it suited me just fine as I wasn't all that hunger.  I do have to say that this is kind of a hidden gem like someone said prior.  Market Square is quite the busy space and to be able to sit and people watch outside while you enjoy your meal is a nice added bonus.  It is kind of tucked away in a corner and allows for you to enjoy yourself in the middle of the hustle and bustle of this downtown oasis.",

    "text": "I keep saying this and having to go back and change my reviews to reflect but, Winghart's is my current favorite burger spot in Pittsburgh!!! I was at first put off by the prices especially since the burgers do not come with fries or any side for that matter but once I took that first bite of the Don't Care Whatever Burger all my pent-up frustration over that pet peeve went right out the door. So the burger itself has pepper jack, cheddar and crumbled bleu cheese with caramelized onions, jalapenos and pepperoncinis along with Sriracha. Ordered it medium and this thing came out perfect and juicy on a light and fluffy bun. No issues with this thing staying together but i was afraid it was going to be a pick it up and don't set it down type of burger. I can safely assure you that you can put it down no problem but you may not want to. It is that good!!! We also ordered the Tatonka Chicken Dip which claims to be like no other buffalo chicken dip you've ever had...I don't know about that but it was really good.  The pita bread was the best part for me to be honest. A nice crusty outer layer and soft Center served warm.  I also really liked the look of this place. I love older dive type settings and this atmosphere fits the bill. Pretty cool decor with a nice open grill area so you can see all the action.  The service at lunch time through the week was fast and friendly with no issues at  Now, prices may be a point of contention here and as I said earlier, I was put off at first but got over it quickly. I do think you should know going in that the cheapest burger you will get is $11 for a half pound bacon cheese burger with the average being about $12.50. Mine was $13.25 and well worth it. The Tatonka Chicken Dip was $9.50 and probably a little high for what it was.  Next time I'd just get a basket of fries to share and call it a day.  There are a lot of other burgers for me to try so I can't wait to come back!",

Soft, fresh and tasty. The place needs a coat rack this time of year. The place is small but bar burger places are small and usually the best. I got a soft drink, 1 size fits all? and too small.

We started the night off with a beer - I had the one that was \"similar to a Blue Moon\" (very good, and lighter than a Blue Moon!), my boyfriend went for the seasonal Cider Ale. It literally tasted like apple juice, fabulous.  I don't know what came over the four of us, but we were bottomless pits last night. We sarted off with two pizzas, the margharita and the chicken sausage. Both were great - the crust was perfect in my eyes.  Then we all ordered the Shipwrecked Burger. Holy Cow. So. Good. If you like your burgers juicey and flavorful, you will love this. Brie, carmelized onions, aruglua?  I grew up eating medium rare meats, but I went with medium (everyone else went well-done). I guess they prepare the meat there so it's safer to eat more-rare, next time I plan to go medium-rare.   The waitress said the fries were good, so we got two orders. And yes, they were very very good. Ketchup not needed.  The manager came over and spoke with us. I love when this happens. She was very friendly and told us a little about the secret behind the fries. I don't care about secrets - I just want more!  I can't wait to go again, and am very excited for the Southside location to open up - I hear there is an expanded menu!",

They were out of lettuce and tomatoes, at a burger joint.... They failed to tell us this until the delivered our food. The burgers themselves were ok. The fries looked like they were the end of the batch and cold.  While we were waiting or our food, a truck pulled up to deliver food. A man was carrying a container of raw burger meat, and liquid was dripping out of it as he walked past and into the restaurant. Disgusting.  I could go on, but you get the point. Pretty disappointing since I've heard good things about their other locations. I blame management.",

Like even my dad and brother, who were yapping because they just couldn't believe I came to Winghart's and didn't get a burger, loved it. The artichoke spread was delicious, creamy and actual big chunks of artichoke [yum]. The red peppers were also very good, super flavorful. I was worried about the olives because I have never liked those purple olives [I don't even know what they are called] but they were just a perfect addition of flavor. And feta cheese? Heavenly. This is seriously something to try even if you don't like veggie stuff. I left full but not uncomfortably so and I still had about a quarter of the patty left. Mmmmmm!",

    "text": "Alright, Burgatory/BRGR/every other trendy gourmet burger establishment that has popped up in Pittsburgh within the past year--it's time to start trying harder. Or maybe, stop trying, because it might be impossible to reach the level of delicious that is Winghart's.  Maybe I'm exaggerating...am I? The burger I had here was most definitely in the top five burgers ever eaten in my life, and THE best in Pittsburgh, though to be fair I'm semi-new to the area and have yet to try Tessaro's. I had the Shipwreck burger: Bacon. Brie. Carmelized Onions. Arugula. Truffle Aioli. TRUFFLE AIOLI--I didn't care what else was on the burger, if I hear \"truffles,\" I'm there. Even though I don't generally like onions, I decided on this rare occassion I would trust Mr. Shipwreck and just order it as-is instead of my usual laundry list of additions and omissions.  Of course I was excited, but I was also a bit nervous. Every one of the toppings has an intense flavor that can easily overpower. But by some miracle, it not only worked, it was perfection, with a complexity that you just have to eat to understand. The burger itself was not quite as red as I prefer, but it was so juicy that it actually didn't matter. Oh, and it's about twice the size of BRGR's pathetically portioned patty. I'm totally in love.  Negatives:  1. Location. I don't go downtown unless I absolutely have to because of obvious transportational issues. Plus, it's not exactly the most happenin' neigborhood in town. UPDATE: Problem solved, there's now a second location on the Southside!  2. The signage. Ed Hardy called, and he wants his logo back. But hey, it's marginally better than BRGR's (no excuse for using Papyrus on anything other than the title page for a 9th grade essay on Ancient Egypt). So, keep rockin' it out Winghart's...that awkward heart tattoo won't stop me from enjoying your obscenely good burgers!",

    "text": "So I FINALLY got my butt over to Winghart's after hearing word of mouth that the place was absolutely a-mazing.    I have to say, first off, that I love the atmosphere.  I've heard some people knock it because it's just a bar atmosphere, but where else do you want to eat your burger?  I certainly don't want my meat with cloth napkins and Tchaikovsky in the background (and I adore Tchaikovsky).  Anyway, I really enjoyed the restaurant/bar atmosphere.  The staff was very inviting, conversational, and humorously sassy.  It was a little stuffy inside (get some of that outdoor seating yo!) but I sat near the door so I could be more comfortable.  I tend to do my research ahead of time when visiting a restaurant with much anticipation, so I already knew I was going to get The Shipwrecked Burger.  Hello white truffle aioli.  And hellllooooo bacon, cheese, and carmelized onions.  Now, unfortunately for me, the brie cheese on the burger was just too dominating a taste.  It has a very earthy flavor which overwhelmed the other toppings.  But I'm not the biggest brie fan, so that whomp whomp was on me.  However, I did feel that the burger was too greasy overall.  When my burger arrived I could already see grease saturated into both halves of my bun.  I'm all for decent fat content to enhance the quality of the beef, but at least for me, too much grease takes away from the flavor and causes everything to kind of mush together.  But I really am a fan of the creative combination for the burger, even though my palate couldn't appreciate the brie.  OOO, and also,  amazing fries!  Delicious fries with the skins still on.  I was so happy when I dug to the bottom of my burger basket and found the tiny little ends that fry up to an amazing crunch.    So I'm definitely going back!  Even though my first burger was a little off, there are still many more options to choose from!  Add in a fun atmosphere and yummy fries, and I'm pretty sure this place will soon become my favorite new Market Square spot.",

I gave Winghart's a shot with a coworker during our lunch break. We sat at the bar and watched the burger craftsman work his magic. The show would lead you to believe that you were in for a treat - not so fast.  We were both very disappointed, so much so that neither of us finished. That is saying something for two guys who love to eat. The meat just did not taste right.  I'm not sure if it was an attempted unique flavor or just a bad batch of meat that made me wonder with each bite if I was to be the next mad-cow victim. Either way, I will never sign myself up to partake in another one of their burgers.  If you need lunch in the square, hit Dibella's for a delicious sub, George Akin's for some excellent chicken, NOLA for a great steak salad, or Chipotle for an always enjoyable calorie load.",

First, let me say that Pittsburgh must be burger central because both burgers are absolutely excellent. For meat, I'd give a slight edge to Winghart's. M&P definitely has better buns. Overall taste I'd give a very slight edge to the Pub Burger at M&P. However, the fries are better at Winghart's so the overall meal is a tossup. Basically, you can't go wrong either way. If you're looking for a slightly more laid-back environment, go with Winghart's. It's small, but the people are friendly and the food rocks.",

Simple burgers, simple bar, everything from seating to ordering.   I had the Denny Double blue burger cooked medium. The meat tasted really super fresh and the burger was cooked to perfection. nice and juicy and not compacted. The meat was super tender compared to some other burgers where the meat may be cooked correctly but the patty was packed together too hard. The buns also tasted really fresh.   The special lady had a veggie burger, what a bore. Just kidding I tried some and would even consider getting those in the future. I said to her, this almost tastes like falaffel (not sure if I spelled it correctly and spell check didn't figure it out). And apparently that is what some of the ingredients are.   They have wine, they have whiskey, they have beer. All the components that I need to come back on a regular basis it wasn't overly expensive either. I would hate to forget to mention the waitress that we had, we didn't sit at the bar because it was full. She was very attentive and polite and we didn't wait long at all for our order to be filled.  Go check it out for yourself sometime.",

This was a slower night since there wasn't a Penguin game and it was after Happy Hour...parking is difficult though.  Got to talk with the staff and owner.  Awesome people.  What makes this place great isn't just the food and nice selection of booze you can't always get in PA state stores (totally recommend the Old Port Rum) ......its the people that run it.  They are comfortable there, they are all friends, they make that place into a joint they would want to go to.  They aren't catering to a certain crowd just to make a profit.  They do it for the love of the restaurant and really make it their own.",

Burgers are excellent! not very classy, drinks come in paper cups and food comes in baskets. They have a large variety of whiskey as well. Hard to find if you don't know where it is-in the corner of market square downtown. Burgers and personal pizzas from $10 and up-wood fired pizza is great!",

Burger is beyond - definitely for that person with exquisite taste - brie, arugula, need I say more?  There are also lots of other selections of burgers to choose from based on your feeling.  I'm only in Pitt once so figured I go for the gold standard - and was not disappointed.",

The burgers are always well cooked.  The fries are top notch, always crispy.  I typically get the Dockworker for the Primanti style with fries and cole slaw.  They use a cream slaw, which I prefer over vinegar.  The downside to this location is the space is much more cramped and they charge for siracha here.  It isn't an exotic ingredient, I don't understand why they charge for it at this location.",

They do not take reservations which was kind of crappy because we knew there would be a wait. We went in and put our name in, we were quoted an hour wait, which was fine because we got to see the tree and grab drinks near by: yards! (Go to their yelp to see my review for them) Towards the end of our hour wait, we headed back to the restaurant. We had to wait another 20 minutes in a very cramped lobby entrance. We tried to grab a seat at the bar downstairs and grab drinks at least to pass the time and were told we couldn't have drinks until we were seated (horrible). We were finally seated in a small dining area upstairs, which was nicely decorated! Our server was a nice blonde who was very slow though. She finally brought the drink menu and never the whiskey menu until we had to ask at least twice for it.. (it's a whiskey bar; we shouldn't have to ask multiple times for it) The menu was great in that it had so many different options but fries should come with the meals. Our friend ordered a drink and they were out of the cider beer, so she ordered something else. Then, they came back to say to her that they were out of the food she ordered, so she had to order something else again, which is a pain, but they said it was on the house finally. I ordered the dockworker burger and asked for no coleslaw but it came with coleslaw and they quickly remade it, which I was grateful for. Burgers had some hard fat pieces in it, but was cooked to perfection! Tried the wings and they were amazing!! Would come back for the wings! Pizza looked amazing too. Overall, not a horrible experience but very long experience.",

    "text": "A+ for the food. The Shipwreck burger, the market square burger, the pizza. All good stuff.   F for the service. I love it how the one dude in the back is screaming out yeah good job, hey keep up the good work, lets keep it up, yet theres customers confused as no one has taken an order or told them where to sit. A little chaotic at best.  They need a hostess to sit people its that simple. Get a hostess, have them sit people and that way people aren't forced to use the to go line to get food. Half the time customers are sent into the vast darkness to look for a seat only to return because theyre all taken then need to step back in line to get it to go.  My main concern is the rule you can't eat our food here if you get to go. Go to Chipotle, get yours to go, sit down eat half the burrito, pack the rest for a snack or dinner later. They give you an abundance of food so you know you'll have leftovers.  Go to wingharts order to go (after the waitress acknoledges you exist), wait 15 minutes for your food, and sit down and watch the manager yell at you! No i swear even the people at the bar looked at him like what the **** do you mean you need to leave. Apparently the bar stools ( about a dozen) were empty and when we sat down he told us to leave the restaurant while we tried to eat their food! It is reserved for the people who ordered sit in and not to go! We would've sat down if all your chairs weren't full 45 minutes ago when we first walked in!   I'm just saying, burgatory is where it's at. I would've given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the dumb manager on duty. I guess the old customer is always right rule doesn't apply here. Or common sense.",

    "text": "Winghart's vs. Tessaro's: FIGHT!  When I heard that this new Winghart's place had better burgers than Tessaro's, it required an immediate visit. I tried the shipwreck burger (bacon, brie, carmelized onions, arrugula, truffle oil) and the Market Square burger (bacon, gruyere, mushrooms), as well as some fries. Here are my findings:  Meat: Slight edge for Tessaro's. Both use very high quality meat ground in house, and both do a good job of cooking to your specification. Tessaro's meat is just a little bit better, though, and the char from their wood grill at adds a lot of flavor. Also, the Winghart's patty is rather greasy, whereas Tessaro's is not at all.  Bun: Tessaro's buns are adequate, but Winghart's' buns are definitely better. They have some egg in them and sort of resemble challah or brioche. Quite tasty.  Toppings: Winghart's is more inventive (see arrugula, brie, truffle oil above), whereas Tessaro's is more traditionalist. Both use high quality ingredients, so I suppose this just depends on personal preference. Push.  Sides: Tessaro's does not have a deep fryer, so no french fries. Their sides are good, but potato salad and cole slaw are obviously no match for even decent fries. Winghart's' fries are fresh cut and fried hard, just the way I like them. They're WAY too salty, however - and this is coming from someone who likes salty fries. These were so incredibly salty that I needed to drink multiple glasses of water just to get them down. Due to this flaw, I'd rather have Tessaro's sides, but if Winghart's would just reduce the salt by half they would probably take this category.  Price: Tessaro's burgers are slightly larger, and they come with sides; for the same amount of money at Winghart's you get a smaller burger and no sides. Also, I noticed aioli on the Winghart's menu and asked for some with my fries and they charged me $2 for a little cup of it! $2! Tessaro's definitely wins on price.  Verdict: Based on burgers alone, Tessaro's is still the best, with Kaya and Winghart's not far behind.  Overall, I'd also say Tessaro's is better, but this could change if Winghart's takes the simple measure of putting less salt on their fries. Winghart's is a new place and still seems to be working out the kinks, while some say that Tessaro's is past its prime, so this comparison will be worth revisiting in six months or a year. We may yet have a new champion.",

    "text": "Love this place! We've been wanting to try  it since it opened and finally got the chance tonight. I think one of the most memorable and I'd even venture to say my favorite part of my meal is overhearing a table ask for a Coors light and the waitress politely responded by saying they only sold craft beers and particularly tried to support other local business. They had me at hello and I didn't even order yet!  I obviously had the shipwrecked. It was fab!! The plus 1 had the market square burger, also good but not as good as mine. The burgers were perfectly cooked and the flavors were spot on!  How were the French fries you ask. Ha probably the best I've ever had...hands down.  The owner stopped over after we were done to check in and shared the secret to the amazing fries, but it's a secret so I'm not telling.  My only gripe is that I didn't really know what to do when I walked in. Should I look for a table, should I wait here..no worries I think they were focused on making some awesome food and being crazy friendly to the tables they did have.  Oh and if you're wondering... I ate the whole damn burger",

    "text": "I came in and sat down to look at the menu, and started chatting with the chef like it was a sushi bar. Turns out I was talking to none other than Shipwreck himself, so his recommendation was fairly obvious. We got a shipwreck, a falafel burger, an order of fries, and a side of cole slaw - I have to try the cole slaw everywhere I go... I almost never like it as much as I hope, but I've gotta know. Blame my inner yinzer.  The food was quick and the wait staff was super nice, they joked around with us, and even though this place orders like a fast food joint(Order at the counter, sit down and you'll get served), the girls come around, refill your drinks, clean up after you, etc. I ran into service like this at Los Cabos, as well and I have to say, I don't like paying - more specifically tipping - before I get my food. Not that I would tip any more or less unless the service was amazing or awful, but it just seems to go against the spirit - more like I'm trying to please the establishment that will be handling my food prep with a number than the other way around.  Anyways, that was just an aside - I really loved the fries, some of them were super crispy, it's hard to find them like that in a lot of places but I love them. The burgers came exactly as we asked for them and they were well presented and covered in toppings. Amazing that they make it all the way to the counter neatly stacked, as they seem to get messy instantly upon picking them up. Well the Shipwreck did, anyways.   The coleslaw was good. I like it a little creamier but it beats Primanti's(as if that's hard to do).. I could definitely eat it, instead of taking a bite and wishing I had grabbed something else.  I didn't try the falafel, unfortunately, I was way too stuffed from trying to eat every last fry(I failed), and it seemed really heavy(I mean it's a giant wad of solid chickpea mass), so half of that remains in our fridge for round two.  I spoke with Shipwreck a bit more about the place, he said the liquor should flow within a few weeks. I caught a meeting with Victory brewing company(thanks for the golden monkey sample a few nights ago, Victory lady!), so expect them on tap(not to divulge any trade secrets!)  Overall, I like this place, and I will like it more when I can grab a drink here. I think the atmosphere is spot on and the people are definitely friendly enough to hang out with, with or without a burger in hand. The pizzas looked good, so that will probably on my list next time.  Unfortunately, the burger has yet to beat out my favorite, Kuma's Corner in Chicago, but I'll take this on a regular basis to Kuma's less than once a year.",

Nobody in the place, and the fry cook was already cleaning up. But they were supposed to be open for another couple hours anyway. We all ordered burgers: Shipwreck, Tallulah Hula, Market Square burgers. The cook, since the grill was just behind the bar and we could watch him make everything, was complaining the ENTIRE time we were there. It was funny though, watching him whip up delicious burger while cursing at no one in particular.   The burgers are delicious though, I think better than BRGR and Burgatory, without the ridiculous wait and pretentiousness. And they sure are serious about their whiskey.  I would skip the fries though, over-cooked and nothing special.  I give it a 3, because the venue is a little dirty looking and very small, also sitting at the bar wasn't too comfortable. But my boyfriend loved everything about it, so I think it's for a very specific niche group of people. Definitely a guy place.",

Very exciting though the food alone is enough to bring you back.  Waitress was incredibly friendly and low key. She is the type of person you could befriend easily after that one conversation. Ordered Shipwreck and not only was the burger huge but juicy and packed with a lot of flavor. I had split an order of fries but I could have done without given the quantity of Shipwreck. Oh man though, I made some room in my stomach for the fries after having one.  Only con is that the space is small though since the weather has been nice we ordered out and ate outside.",

Based on the reviews here and elsewhere on the internet, I decided to check out Winghart's. I am glad that I did because it was a very delicious burger.  Wingharts is a pretty small place in Market Square, but it does have some outside seating which is helpful if you go at a popular time. The menu is small, basically just burgers and pizza. But since they do these so well they don't really need to add anything to the menu. I went with a burger with bacon and cheese on it and it was outstanding. Sometimes when you order a burger with bacon the bacon can overpower the burger, but not so here. The bacon was a perfect compliment to the very tasty patty.  Only negative aspect of my experience is the waitress, while very nice, wasn't the most attentive waitress. But it wasn't bad enough that I would not come back or recommend it to others.",

    "text": "My first trip to Winghart's, I would give 3 stars.  The atmosphere is mediocre at best.  The dining area is very cramped and close and they have about 3 sets of tiny Ikea track lighting.  Hopefully you have a flashlight in your pocket to help read the menu.  The food was good, but nothing special. It's basically typical bar food: wings, burgers, salads. I had an appetizer of wings, which were delicious and probably the major bright spot of the experience.  Very saucy and moist.  The burger I received was well-done after I had asked for medium; no big deal, but not a positive factor.  The fries were soggy and seemed overcooked. The wait staff is somewhat attentive, but they usually are short staffed (one waitress covering about 6-7 tables).  Overall, Winghart's is overrated.  For a typical bar atmosphere with little to no A/C (very warm inside) and mediocre food, it's overpriced and not worth it.   My second trip: disaster.  I wanted to give them another shot after my first trip described above so I took my family there.  First, there is no hostess, even at dinner time.  It's first-come, first-served.  Well, there were six of us in the party. The tables in the back dining area are tiny and so we decided to pull three together so everyone could fit.  We are rather small people too, and three tables was comfortable for all of us, but we didn't exactly have extra room.  The waitress came and took our drink orders (and the CO2 for beer and soda was malfunctioning, so the choices were water, bottled beer, or unsweetened iced tea).  After everyone ordered, one of the bartenders came back and asked where one of the tables next to us had gone as there were two or three extra chairs against the wall where the table had been.  When we told him that we were using it because we had a larger party, he snarled and asked if he could take one away. We kindly replied that it would be uncomfortable for 6 of us to try and fit at two small-sized tables as our knees would be knocking and we would not likely fit everyone's drinks and dinners on the table.  After asking us, and, in turn, us replying, he did not let it go.  He insisted that it was impractical for us to be using three tables and that he's seen 4 people fit at one table in the past.  After rolling his eyes and basically telling us we were being absurd, my party and I decided that Winghart's was not the place to eat that night and left.  He begged us not to leave as we walked out and said that we could use all of the tables if we wanted, but why stay at a place that obviously doesn't want your business?  This particular bartender lost out on a big check and nice tip for his waitress.  I will never dine here again.  Therefore, 1 star.",

    "text": "You will like this place if you like a wild crazy atmosphere.  But I went for lunch and at lunch time I prefer a calm relaxing atmosphere.  We walked in early (about 11:45) and were told that we could sit where we wanted but we had to order at the bar.  I ordered the salad a la Pittsburgh with water to drink and it came to about 12 bucks.  We got the last table.  The place is tiny so I'd recommend if you're going for lunch you get there at 11:30 or take your food to go.    The place is loud and noisy with loud music and waiters screaming out order numbers.    As for the food, my friend got a burger without a bun.  It was very greasy. With no bun and the burger wrapped in paper and no plate, it was quite messy.  Because of all the fat in the burger her initial reaction was that it was very good, but by the end she was overcome by the grease.   I odered the salad as I mentioned.  It came in a cardboard box with grease soaking through the bottom because I ordered my salad with beef, which turned out to be the greasy hamburger meat.  We ate with flimsy plastic forks and knives.  Initially, I thought the salad was great, but I was also overcome by the grease before I could finished.  I realize that grease/fat makes burgers more tasty, but I don't think the food was good enough to compensate for the stressful atmosphere and high prices.  Burgers start at $8.50 without fries.  I think this is probably a good place to go if you like a loud bar atmosphere and greasy burgers aren't  trying to eat healthy and don't mind crazy prices.",

I even got it takeout which I thought would make it all soggy - but I must have picked it up at the perfect moment b/c I can't say enough positive things about this pizza.

Fresh-cut fries topped with melty beer cheese. The beer cheese was almost like a spread, kind of thick with a sharp cheddar flavor with some spice and beer mixed in. Would definitely order those again or anything else on the menu that includes the beer cheese!

Such wonderful combination of flavors in the toppings, which is no mean feat--but the burger itself is the centerpiece.

Without hesitation, Winghart's was suggested.  I ordered the \"I don't care, whatever\" burger which has jalapenos and pepper jack cheese.  The patty was cooked perfectly to my requested medium.  The patty, though, didn't feel processed or tough.  The meat tasted fantastic and the burger was topped generously.  After stacking some fries onto the burger, because I'm apparently a Yinzer at heart, the burger reached it's max potential.  I can't tell you if it's the best burger in the city but I was certainly not going to question the decision to come here.  I was pleasantly stuffed.  Perhaps understated in this whole experience was the ability to sit outside on such a great evening and watch the liveliness in Market Square.  The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was even better, and when shared with great company and some cold drinks, I'd be hard pressed to find a better, more relaxing, and casual meal.

I got the southwest burger and cajun fries and both were exceptional. They dont microwave or freeze any of their food. You get what you pay for",

The beer and spirits list has grown exponentially to include all sorts of wonderful libations.   The mission however, was burgers, plain and simple. My girlfriend and I each got a different burger platter, as well as seasonal brews (cant get enough pumpkin or fall type beers).   I ordered the \"Whatever, I dont care\" burger, which was befitting for my current state of hunger and craving. Wingharts gets 4 stars because it took obnoxiously long to get our burger at 9pm on a Wednesday!  However, when it arrived, it did not disappoint. The gooey, messy burger that I remembered was still kickin! Pepperjack cheese and a generous helping of jalapenos (HAL-EP-EENO for trailer park boys fans) was delectable, solidifying Wingharts as my go to (sorry Tessaros) burger place in the burgh.",

It tasted like it was soaked in kerosene. I couldn't even eat the burger and the fries were served to us basically black - they were extremely burnt I am shocked to see someone even serve something like that. My friend also ordered a burger medium rare and it came out more than rare. I think the center was actually still cold. The macaroni and cheese was okay, but sadly that is the only positive thing I have to say about this place. Don't think I'll ever be returning.",

    "text": "I love the Winghart's Shipwreck burger-it is in my opinion the best burger in the 'Burgh!!.   I used to go to the Winghar'ts in Market Square but after the fire, it didn't seem the same to me.  Part of it may have been the change in staff, but it no longer felt like a good atmosphere to me.  I have been to the Southside location several times since, however.  I found the staff very friendly and one of the bar tenders made me a really great coffe/liquor drink that wasn't on the menu.  She took the time to cater to what I asked for and it was also her favorite drink, so I knew she would take time making a scrumptious cocktail.  I do think the french fries are amazing if not soggy or over-cooked.  They can be on the salty side so I usually ask for no salt and they oblige. I thought it was wonderful that they did the pay what you can day a few weeks ago to support a shelter in the North SIde.  Best burger in the Burgh!",

We ordered the perogies, and buffalo and maple BBQ chicken wings, all of which were absolutely delicious. But I gotta say that the Punjabi Mac and cheese (tiki masala flavored) was the best. DELICIOUS. I was sober as the designated driver, and I was chowing down just as much as everyone else. Definitely recommend this place for dinner or even late night snacks or meals. I hear the lunch is delicious too. Would love to eat there again next time we're in town.",

What this place really is: a place to go hang out and watch the game.  It's not really appropriate for a date or anything too \"special.\"    We ordered a pizza to split, some beers and then afterwards a round of old fashioned's.  The pizza was a little over the top (something with brie and mushrooms I think) but it was pretty good.  The beers were recommended by the server and were excellent.  The drinks were very well constructed.  Service was perfectly attentive.  I think this place could use a little bit of a face lift to improve the ambiance - there is some sort of graffiti mural on the wall where we were upstairs and it just didn't give off the vibe of \"I want to hang out here, relax and chat and drink whiskey all night.\"",

It's a little heavy - you'll be dragging if you eat lunch here on a work day - and although I know everyone's taste is different, I do think they are a bit heavy on the salt.  The menu is quite pricey, but you pay for good, fresh ingredients I suppose.  The result?  I rarely eat here, but I always enjoy it.    This visit I had the Shipwreck burger.  The meat was tender, fresh, and cooked perfectly, with arugula, Brie cheese (also melted perfectly), white truffle aioli, caramelized onions, and bacon.  I don't do burgers often, but when I do, I do it in style.  Lol.    FYI, I have heard complaints from others about the music volume being way too intense here.",

After watching an entertaining light show outside of this restaurant/bar...we decided to stop in to explore the local beers on the menu. Now...I'm not a big beer fan, but it seemed like my weekend trip to Pittsburgh was all about exploring new and fun beers and it was so worth it!   I tried the Cocoa Loco Choco Stout, the Original Hand Cider, and the Sara Saranac Prism. I really enjoyed each and every one of them. The Choco Stout was not too chocolatey, the Hand Cider tasted like crisp apples, and the Saranac made me feel like I was on a beach somewhere enjoying an exotic beer.  We also decided to try the Balsamic Garlic Wings. These were seriously the best wings that I've ever had. They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I really loved the flavor too.  I feel awful for not remembering our waitresses name, but she was absolutely amazing. She helped with picking out the beer selections and also provided us hand written instructions for other local bars to try in the area.  I will definitely be visiting this place again on my next trip to Pittsburgh! Love. Love. Love.",

    "text": "So after checking out a few of the joints in Pittsburgh, I was craving a nice juicy burger with some fries. After just a little bit of searching, I stumbled upon this joint on yelp and decided to walk over on a Sunday evening. The setup is in Market Square itself and is tucked into the corner between starbucks and primanti brothers. There are two floors with the bottom floor being a view of the kitchen whiles the top floor having the full blown bar. I of course made my way to the top floor and sat down at the bar next to the tv. These guys actually have a pretty solid collection of hard alcohol which I was impressed with along with hosting a few different types of Japanese whiskey which was also a nice plus. The bartenders upstairs are pretty chill and friendly providing quick service and good conversation.   I have been here twice now and have ordered the shipwreck, the market sq burger, and the Cajun fries. The fries are solid so if you are here with a group (or by yourself *guilty face) then definitely order some fries. If you like cheese, ask them to top it off with beer cheese and they will gladly accommodate. The shipwreck is loaded with brie cheese, bacon and white truffle aioli while the market square burger is loaded with mushrooms, gruyere cheese, bacon, and a honey mustard sauce. The meat is juicy and my particular orders had good flavor to them. The shipwreck was solid but I did think the truffle aioli went a bit over the top with the way they loaded it on. Still obviously didn't stop me from eating all of it and it wont for you either. The market square burger was solid with the gruyere cheese being perfect complimented with the honey mustard.   I am a fan of the place and will be back whenever im searching for some burgers/fries and a good selection of whiskey",

We wanted take out and he was totally cool with that and offered to help if we had any questions.   It took us about ten full minutes to decide what to order, everything item looked unbelievable. Very interesting burgers and sandwiches, great flavor combos and all freshly made ingredients.   We finally settled on the \"I don't care whatever\" burger with their house made garlic chicken patty, the Market Square burger cooked medium and an order of white truffle aioli fries. Long story short, go there now and order all of these things. The garlic chicken patty was juicy and flavorful and the burger was giant and cooked perfectly. The truffle aioli was light and fresh and indulgent-maybe the best I've ever had.   The chef, Steven (or Country), went out of his way to tell us about all the sauces they serve and even let us try a few. He was so friendly and knowledgeable!   Check out Winghart's for the best burger of your life and some of the best hospitality in all of Pittsburgh.",

The fries were truly awful, basically the burnt tiny pieces that end up in the bottom of the fry bin at the end of the shift, and they had no seasoning on them (we ordered the mojo fries). We had to request more seasoning, but even then, they were gross.  The chicken dip was boring and bland. Some Franks and Philly Cream Cheese with canned chicken has more flavor.   They were completely out of Mac and cheese AND the beer I ordered. I probably should have had a burger to fully round out our experience, but this was way more than enough mediocre junk food for one day.  There are SO MANY great restaurants in Pittsburgh.

So I decided it would be OK to indulge in some Winghart's for my evening meal! I didn't want to go overboard, so just stuck to the Mumbai Pie. Being Indian, I was both intrigued and skeptical as to what this Indian-inspired pizza could be. It was incredible! A 10\" thin crust pizza on what looked and tasted like an atta flour (wheat) crust, the base was their take on a tikka masala sauce, topped with minced grilled chicken (like keema), a few fresh mozzarella slices and scallions. I ended up eating the entire thing in about 5 minutes, and don't regret one bit of it! It was delicious and I highly recommend the Mumbai Pie at Winghart's. I've also tried their garlic wings and perogies, which were also delightful.... but can't wait to try the Shipwreck burger and much talked about Boomer pizza, next!",

The restaurant started off on a great foot by being in the market square and staying open past 10pm unlike other Pittsburgh restaurants. The waitress was positive, helpful and informative the entire night.   Although its called WINGhart dont be misled, the burger is the best thing on the menu. We got the wings (buffalo and Jamie O.) and a bacon cheese burger w everything. The wings were not as crispy as i would have preferred but the sauce and ranch was good.   The burger, medium well was perfect! I thought the bread was going to be a little too hard at first when cutting it but it was fine. They dice the onions, pickles, and bacon which surprisingly integrate well into the flavor of the burger. The cheese also; they give you two slices of cheddar cheese. Even though you have to request ketchup and mustard, its ok because it comes out of the fridge, nice and cold which is a great contrast to the fresh burger.",

The sauce was good so I recommend this flavor but the meat could have been fried longer in my opinion. I got the whisky mac and cheese for dinner, tasted very good would recommend getting, but the portion was kinda small for ten dollars. It was like the same amount as the craft Mac and cheese cups or maybe a little more but I was expecting a bigger portion. My friend got the bacon and onion pierogis, she said they were good but was expecting the onions and bacon to be inside them, they were on top so just a heads up. My two other friends both got the harper's burger. They said the burgers were delicious, but the burger was quite expensive 15 dollars and they don't even come with fries. We had to order the fries separately, they were good especially with the ranch. Overall the food was pretty good. The girl who greeted us was quite rude, she seemed irritated that we were there. Our regular waitress was nice, attentive. Honestly just thought the place was too expensive for what we got and expected the place to be bigger or trendier if you compare it to the website.",

    "text": "Cool little joint in the market square, small space, great food, a little loud in the back, but overall a good experience.  We decided to split several items at the table so we could try all the different options.  Excellent decision and we all left very satisfied.   Buffalo Wings- fried crispy the way I like them.  Sauce reminded me of Ray's buffalo wing sauce; very tasty, somewhat creamy, not to spicy but with a  noticeable kick. Excellent. For $13.50 I was hoping for more than about 8 wings, but they were larger wings so wasn't too bad.   The Tikka Masala wings were a real hit. Not something you see on the everyday menu; we had to try them and were not disappointed.  They taste exactly as you would think they would: a wing fried crispy and drenched in Tikkk Masala sauce. what more could you ask for?  These were pretty mild for those not looking for a kick in their wings.   The bourbon Mac-n-cheese was pretty amazing. Large shell noodles, cooked al dente, and smothered in a rich cheese blend. This was a big hit as well.   We could have skipped the Cajun fries. They were soft and mushy yet tasted over cooked.  No seasoning to speak of and we were just overall not impressed.  The big hit for the night was the hand-tossed Boomer pizza made with arugula, bacon, caramelized onion, truffle aioli, brie cheese, and crimini mushrooms. Truly a uniquely inspired creation that put your taste buds into overload. The flavor sensation is so intense I can't imagine eating the pie as a main course but sharing a few slices around the table was definitely a good choice for us.   With four adults, this was enough food for us all to eat our fill and have some, but very little, left over.  The drawbacks from the evening were that the interior dining space is very cramped and features an open kitchen. While it was quite neat to watch the cook line preparing meals, we were literally feet away from the hot ovens making the whole place overly hot and uncomfortable. Next time I'll opt for an upstairs or outside table which should solve this.   Waitress was very pleasant, well meaning, but overly absent minded; having to return 3-4 times to get things requested but forgotten.  We'll attribute this to it being at peak hours on a Friday night.   Overall reasonably priced and a solid dining experience. I'd recommend this to anyone and look forward to trying more items from the menu on a future visit.",

    "text": "The last time I was at this restaurant was in early 2013 at the East Carson St. location and I ordered the Shipwreck burger because it sounded so delicious. Delicious is an understatement. Ever since then I would still think and dream over that burger and talk about it with other people who probably didn't care about a burger they couldn't try for themselves.  A few weeks ago this burger and I had a rapturous though short-lived reunion at the downtown location. I probably didn't pay attention back in 2013 but apparently now Winghart's is also known for its pizza, but I didn't get any this time. I always thought it was known for their handmade burger patties...but maybe it's because I was so smitten with this one it didn't matter what the other menu items were....  Anyway the only reason I'm leaving off 1 star (though perhaps it should be just half of a star off) is that service happened to be slow on this Friday afternoon when I went, but the staff were courteous and attentive when they could be. Maybe I'll change my mind later and just give it the full 5....",

My mom and I are in Pittsburgh for the weekend to attend a seminar at the history museum and we ended up at Winghart's because it was nearby and didn't require a reservation. I'm glad we stopped in!  At first I feared that I made a mistake...the seating upstairs was really cramped and the music was ridiculously loud. However, after about ten minutes or so the noise died down, the room became more comfortable, and we had a really nice dinner.  I ordered the Shipwreck Burger, she ordered the Dock Burger, and we split a side of fries. Everything was exactly what I would have expected from a place touting the title of a burger and whiskey bar: great portions, crispy fries, and messy burgers. Messy in a good way, of course. The \"lick the aioli and brie off of your fingers because the napkin isn't worthy\" kind of messy. The Shipwreck was truly delicious. If you're into arugula, truffle, caramelized onions, brie cheese, and decadence, you can't go wrong.  We both had a Gram Positive (scotch, orange and fig honey, lemon, and fresh ginger). It was balanced and refreshing, and it was a great complement to the rich food.  Our server was friendly, polite, and as prompt as she could be on a busy Saturday night. Though I may never visit Winghart's again because I'm not from the area, I suggest you check it out!",

    "text": "I bookmarked Winghart's months ago since it is so difficult to find mid-scale dining options in downtown Pittsburgh.  Based on the reviews, I was kind of disappointed.  This place is really not much more than A-OK, in my opinion.  My friend and I stopped in on a Friday night around 10:00 PM.  There are two floors, both with bar areas.  We thought the first floor was a bit grody since the kitchen is open, but the second floor was much classier.  We decided to sit at the bar, and the bartenders were great.  Very friendly and cool.  The place was about 1/4 full on a Friday night.  The food is normal bar food at kind of excessive prices.  The Blue Addiction Mac and Cheese ($10) was only big enough to be a side.  Additionally, it's just the regular mac and cheese with blue cheese tossed in for an extra $3.  The mac and cheese was pretty creamy, but it was over-powered by the blue cheese.  The Dude Ranch fries ($4.50) were more reasonably priced but still a small plate of fries tossed in ranch seasoning and drizzled in ranch.  They were fine fries for a bar but not special.  We finished this all off with a funnel cake ($7.25), which was on the cold side, considering they had just made it.  The burgers and sandwiches seemed to be a better price, but the other food was just lackluster.  The biggest issue is that if you have food allergies, DO NOT come here!!!!  We found french fries mixed in our funnel cake and vice versa.  I wonder how clean the kitchen is...  OK if you can drop your hard-earned money on mediocre food.",

Relative to the recently cooling boutique burger trend, Winghart's is by far my favorite (disclosure:  I still haven't made it to Burgatory).  The Shipwreck, Collin's Orangutan, and the \"I don't care whatever\" burgers are all great and exactly what you're looking for when in the mood of self-indulgence...  big, greasy, salty, and flavorful.  What I'm not crazy about however is this place anytime near lunch, dinner, or any major occasion at Market Square.  The location is just simply too small to handle any kind of volume (even with the new addition upstairs), and it completely destroys what would otherwise be a FANTASTIC watering hole (dark, grungy, good beer, good food, laid back, etc.).  I just can't stand fighting to get to the bar to order, or worse, having people fight over my back to order their own.",

I was originally a bit miffed because the place is so small and cramped (which as a big girl is my NIGHTMARE) and couldn't possibly see how the food would be good enough to overcome my discomfort, but boy was I proved wrong.   I had the Market Square burger and the mac 'n cheese, and both were phenomenal. The meat was fresh, seared perfectly and yet still had a smoky flavor (despite being cooked on a flat top), and the toppings complimented the meat really well. The cheese sauce on the mac was oddly sophisticated for this hole in the wall place and pretty good as well. I really liked that they used shells and not elbow noodles.  If you want separate checks, be sure to tell the waitress ahead of time. We were told she couldn't split it because blah blah blah the system didn't work like that blah blah blah it'd be easier for us to split it ourselves and tell her exactly what amount we needed charged on our cards.   It is worth noting that I have been to the Winghart's other location on Monroeville twice and the food doesn't taste as good. Try to get to the original if you can!",

    "text": "I want to love this place. I really do. But I don't. Let me explain.  I came here a couple weeks ago on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. Pittsburgh is my and my husband's old stomping ground, but we're always up for trying something new. My sister-in-law suggested meeting here in Market Square. I fully expected to love it, since they have some of my favorite words: whiskey, burgers, thin-crust pizza. Sounded like a great way to kick off a weekend.   We walk in just after 2, and there's actually a decent number of people enjoying a late lunch like we were, and that was surprising in and of itself. Our server took quite a while to acknowledge our existence. We were perusing the drink menu, trying to decide what unfamiliar whiskey to try. When we in the process of ordering drinks, one of us asked for recommendations based on what we know we like, and all she gave us was \"I'm a beer drinker\". So, two strikes so far.   She brought the drinks, and we ordered our food. We all ended up ordering pizzas, since those are easier to share. My husband and his sister both order a pizza exactly as written from the menu, and I've got my eye on one that sounds good, bar one ingredient: mushrooms. I HATE mushrooms. I requested if I could get the pizza without mushrooms, and the server did not indicate that it would be a problem. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me that they can't do that, and I question why, and she indicates that the chef/cook won't do it. No further explanation.  I ended up custom making the pizza the way I wanted it, which was essentially all the ingredients from the specialty pizza without the mushrooms. No issues with making that one. Sounds to me like the chef/cook was being a diva, and I really can't get that attitude for a restaurant owner. While yes, I understand that food is often an art, you are serving people with different preferences and should be confident enough in your craft that you won't get offended when someone orders a slightly modified version of your original dish. Especially at a glorified hole-in-the-wall burger joint.   The atmosphere was dive-y, which was expected. Our table was dirty when we sat down, and we ended up wiping it down ourselves. I would recommend that they spend a bit of money to actually fix the bathroom door, rather than put in yet another partial fix to make it close and lock.   Overall, I won't be making this a part of my essential Pittsburgh recommendation list.",

    "text": "Dropped in for food during a holiday visit to the Pittsburgh area. The place was incredibly slow. At issue seemed to be the holiday craft fair going on at the time, and people flooded in after us as it began raining outside. A second waitress was necessary to help handle the Sunday event traffic, apparent friction between staff didn't help to streamline things. Our biggest bottleneck was just getting an order placed, which the staff behind the counter could have picked up to help get people in and out quicker.   The wait aside the food was excellent. Music playing was all 90's / 00's rock / punk. The place felt I'd walked into Golden Boy Pizza back home in San Francisco, I was taken aback at how familiar the place was for having never been there.   I got the impression that the slow service was an unusual circumstance. I'd come back, when things are less busy next time.",

    "text": "So, I'm really unsure on how I want to start this review because I feel rather conflicted. I came into this restaurant with high expectations (formed mostly by my own interest) and was hoping I would come out in love. Well, I was in love, but not in as much love as I was hoping.   The burgers - Definitely fresh and quality A meat, but my only (and it's somewhat small) disappointment is the over-seasoning of the meat. The beef is great on its' own and didn't need to be masked by the additional seasonings. The bun was excellent (fresh and almost sweet) and went well with everything. It was a bit sloppy -- but what burger isn't? Overall, I loved mine and I got the shipwrecked.  Other food - I got coleslaw because I was very hungry, and it was quite good. It came in a Styrofoam container that resembled something from a fast-food joint, and for the price of everything, I wasn't fond of the lack of presentation. The fries were great, simple and homemade, but I do have one minor complaint. While they were good (and I'd take them over most other places), they lacked any seasoning and I felt like what was in the meat could have been utilized more on the fries.  The place - Very cool and hip. It's a mix between casual with high-end tastes. It's very small though. Walking behind the bar is tight and there are only a small handful of tables. I think this added to it's downtown uniqueness, but it seems like it can't accommodate it's own popularity.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and I will be back. Again, I had high expectations and a slightly underwhelming experience, but 4 stars (almost 3 at times) is all I can muster. I will definitely be back, because at the end of the day, it's a burger joint and it does them well.",

    "text": "Hooray! A good burger!    Considering how this town prides itself on being not fancy and blue collar I was astonished at the general lack of a not mediocre burger.   Winghart's exceed my expectations.  I had a Shipwreck pizza and the boyfriend had the burger with the truffle oil.  They were divine!  The dough on the pizza was crisp, an appropriate thickness for the toppings and didn't have too much corn meal on the bottom.  There was an absurd amount of bacon and meat in the chili.  I couldn't stop shoving it in my face.  The burger was cheesy and perfectly cooked.  The meat was moist.  SO MOIST.  The fries were also superlative.  Crispy and the right size.  The portions were huge.  The whiskey was great.  They only serve double pours so be ready to roll out of there stuffed full of amazing and a little on the drunk side.    So now we come to the part of the review where I complain.  The place burns incense.  Honest to god it smells of Patchouli.  The number one rule of decorating a restaurant is you don't want anything that smells strongly because it detracts from the smell of the delicious food. The service wasn't bad per se, but she clearly had no experience with high end service (and considering the prices for the Burg, they ARE in the high end bracket).   Now, the biggest issue was NO WHISKEY LIST.  You heard it right kids, NO LIST.  I am astonished. The waitresses response was \"The whiskeys change too often for us to keep an up to date list\".  SHENANIGANS.  If you have a laptop and a printer YOU CAN UPDATE THAT SHIT EVERYDAY.  The bar I work at has 50 billion beers and on some days over 10 beers are changed.  And guess what WE CHANGE THE MENUS EVERYDAY SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES IN A NIGHT.  I refuse to accept that these people who made a delicious meal and opened an otherwise wonderful restaurant can't use a printer.  So how DO you order a whiskey if there is no list?  You have two exciting options!  One: annoy the people at the bar by pushing in their space to get a look at the bottles.  Jumping to see over people optional.  Two: Ask the waitress.   Oh wait, SHE DOESN\"T KNOW THE LIST.  So you end up just having to pick something and hope they have it. If you don't know what you should order, tough. You know what would make this easier?  A MENU.  You won't be dissapointed.  I realize there was a good amount of complaining in this review, but it's still in my top 10 places in the Burg.  GO NOW!",

We started with a few beers from a pretty extensive menu.  Our waiter Carl rocked!  When I knocked over my draft, Carl was over in seconds to help.  We started with chili cheese fries which were more than enough to share.  The chili was good.  I plan on sampling a bowl soon.  We both had burgers and they were very very good.  Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  I'd put this in the same category as BRG.   Since it is closer to us than BRG and Burgatory we'll be back to see ol Carl whenever we are in the mood for a good burger.

    "text": "I'm sad to say I was rather underwhelmed with my first visit to Winghart's. I had the Livingsocial coupon to use and was excited to go, but I'm not sure I'll visit again.  I had the Market Square burger. It was okay. Was it $9 okay? Nope. Especially considering that $9 doesn't include fries or chips or anything. The beef didn't have much flavor to it, and for a medium-well burger it was pretty dry. Cheese was flavorless really. Bun was untoasted and dry. I'm not impressed. I asked if they had Pepsi or Coke, the server said all they have is some generic Cola. That's it.  I also ordered a \"side\" of chili. Now I saw on the menu that they have chili for $6, what I assumed was a bowl of chili. I asked our server, \"Can I have just a side of chili? Something smaller than the regular portion?\" I really just wanted a cup of chili so I could see how it was. She said \"Yeah, you can get a side.\" Now when we get the bill I realize she gave me the $6 portion of chili. I guess it was a misunderstanding, but I don't know how much more clear I could be about wanting a side of chili.  The chili was good...lots of beef, just a bit of beans, good flavor. Wish it was a bit spicier, but I like my chili spicy, so that's a persona preference. Was it $6 good? Not really. It was much too small for the price in my opinion.  We also tried the fries, which I will say were pretty good. These are how you WANT Primanti's fries to be...thick, nice and crispy, just the right amount of greasy. These were the only things that were reasonably priced on the menu, although in my opinion they ought to be included with your burger.  Now, the restaurant itself...First off, I know the place is \"edgy\" and all, but I was surprised at the presentation. This place is rather rough around the edges. Mismatched, wobbly tables and chairs, not much room for dining in to begin with although it seems they may be expanding upstairs? Really the place looks more like an old dive bar than a new restaurant. We had our baby with us, and now we know this is NOT a good place to bring a young'un.   Our table was positioned in front of a big refrigerator (in the dining space? Really?) and someone apologetically asked my husband to move so he could put a big tray of raw burgers into the fridge. I mean, come on. In addition, EVERYTHING is disposable. Paper cups for our \"cola,\" plastic forks for my chili (yeah, no spoons, just forks...), paper cup for the chili, paper tray for the fries...tacky (even for a bar), not to mention incredibly wasteful. If I'm paying $9-12 for a burger, I'm pretty sure you can spring for real plates.  All in all I'd say this bar/restaurant is about 80% bar, 20% restaurant. Not a good place for groups, not a good place for kids. Since Burgatory is pretty much my gold standard for burgers now, I'm gonna have to say thumbs down in the burger department here. BUT, I do still wanna try their pizza, and the chili and fries were definitely good, so they sit at 3 stars for me for now. They have a really cute concept here, the menu is funny and charming...it just needs a little polishing.",

    "text": "So after running around the city doing the Pittsburgh Challenge and being carb deprived, Wingharts seemed like a good choice for an early dinner!    We walked up to the small restaurant/bar and grabbed a table outside.  The menu consists of burgers, pizza and a couple salads.  Although standard offerings each one has a unique twist.  We started off with some fries and I ordered the veggie burger.  The fries were delish (how many bad fries have you really had though) but the burger was lacking.  The patty was dry and condiments didn't bring much to the table.  For my first taste of carbs in a while, I was underwhelmed.   My friend got the cheese pizza which kinda looked like a cafeteria pizza. She said it wasn't anything to write home about.   Pros: Love new restaurants in market square, outside sitting, full bar, good fries  Cons: A bit underwhelming taste wise.  Fries don't come with your burger so you end up spending about $11 for a veggie burger which seems steep to me.   Overall:  I will definitely sit outside and people watch in station square but I am not rushing back.",

    "text": "I'm going to preface my review with this...I don't like burgers (veggie or otherwise).  I've heard great things about Wingharts so I took some coworkers down here for lunch knowing I would be ordering a pizza.  We tried to go early because I've heard it gets really busy at lunch.  Unfortunately, the line at 11:45 was about 10 people longer than the line at noon.    I also didn't realize that they have almsot zero seating except a few small tables at the back and the bar seating.  We didn't want to sit at the bar because of the long line that wraps around right behind you, so we opted for our food to go.  The place definitely has a Primanti's type feel to it.  Wait in line, order at the bar, crowded, limited to no seating at lunchtime.  I'll do takeout next time I go.  I went with the Tatonka Chicken Pizza.  Good but not great.  I loved the chicken sausage on it which had a great bite but it needed more chicken on it.  Some of my slices didn't get any chicken!  My other gripe about the pizza was that it was a little on the salty side.  I think it was a result of the blue cheese being very salty but who knows.  My coworkers both ordered the Sweet Georgia Brown but when we got back to work, we discovered that one of their pizzas was missing the barbeque chicken.  Oops.    Overall, a little bit of a letdown given the rave reviews on yelp and personal accounts from friends but I'll be back.",

You get a choice of a pretty good array of burgers but not an overwhelming amount. I've heard that their pizza is pretty good but I haven't had it since the burgers are hard to turn down. Definitely a must if you are going to be downtown or in south side. I believe they are opening one up in Oakland right where PCAFE used to be for all you Pitt alumni. Although the memories are fond there I don't know if I would trade them for this burger joint but it would be a tough decision. Let's just say that the students who go to Pitt now are lucky to be exposed to such a Pittsburgh gem, I hope they take advantage of it!",

It was quite a bit smaller than I expected, even with my expectation of it being a hole-in-the-wall kind of burger joint. No worries though, as we were the only ones in there late that Saturday afternoon.   The waitress was friendly and service was quick. She recommended the Shipwreck Burger and the Market Square Burger. We took her advice and added a basket of fries. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more choices for a place that is predominantly a burger place. There were 6 options, none of which were exactly what I was craving at the time. I would have appreciated an option to customize my own (like Burgatory). That's right, I said it.   Fries were served first and I thought they were excellent. They had a sweet, yet salty flavor to them and are definitely in my top 5 list of fries around the city.   The burgers were good - though I wouldn't say they're the best. Again, top 5 from what I've sampled. We ordered them both well-done, and they came out almost too well done. The toppings were good - very unique. I enjoyed the Shipwreck, however my wife wasn't thrilled with the sauce on the Market Square burger.   I would certainly be up for going again, although we rarely make it down to that area of town. A solid 4 stars in my book.",

Winghart's is a newer addition,  and a welcome one at that!  I waited to review Winghart's, because several months after opening, they didn't have their licquor license and they weren't open on Saturdays. All that has changed.   The burgers are a bit pricey, but they are huge and high-quality.  I get the Shipwreck with homemade potato salad almost every time.  I have also enjoyed their Market Square burger. My co-workers love the pizzas.  Decent selection of draft beers and licquor for such a small place.   All around, a four-star establishment.  Why the extra star? Because I enjoy watching Dr. Who with Shipwreck during my weekend lunch breaks. Worth it.",

I was able to find a couple beers that were quite good though. I am not much of a liquor guy but I tried a sip of the whiskey my friend got and it was quite tasty.  I got the Hula burger. It was decent. The fries were also pretty good.I felt pretty cramped eating at the bar though and the platter they served the burger and fries on wasn't really big enough for the food given. It also was pretty freezing inside, especially when the door opened.  The bartender was very friendly and enthusiastic. All of the staff were very nice and personally say hello to you as you walk in from behind the bar. One problem I had with the service was that my burger came about 10 minutes before my friend's pizza. I know we were sitting at the bar, but it would be nice to get our food at the same time. The music selection and atmosphere inside were both great.  Overall I would definitely come back for a casual meal and drink. Perhaps when the weather is better. Im not sure if they have outside seating but that would be a plus.",

    "text": "I've been here a number of times now and each time gotten one of their brick oven pizzas. They would be considered individual sizes, but a few are simply to \"hearty\" to finish. One of my favorites is the Winghart Attack. It is effectively a pizza with an order of chili cheese fries on top and the only time that it was finished was when I shared a few slices with a friend.  The atmosphere is a dive and very tiny, but the food is really good, the staff was pleasant and definitely worth a stop as long as you don't hit the peak of the lunch time rush.",

The only complain I have is I asked for my burger well done it there was still some pink in it. It wasn't a big deal, but I prefer my meat done well. The fries are amazing as well! I was surprised by how many I got in an order.",

    "text": "Winghart's is a relatively small place, but has a ton of whiskey to drink! If you're visiting you can take your drink to the edge of the overhang outside the entrance.  Their kitchen is appended to the bar at the very far end. They have a limited selection of beers here in addition to the variety of hard alcohol, which appears to be the businesses primary focus.  The bartenders were extra friendly and provided us with excellent service during our visit here.",
