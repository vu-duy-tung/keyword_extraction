    "text": "Carl saved the day! I had someone from out of town who never had pierogies before. I went on a wild goose chase looking for the best pierogies and Cop Out was my go to place! When the initial call was made to order the food, Carl's daughter answered the phone, I told her my situation, she asked \"dad\" if he could help and there was zero hesitation! Carl informed me that he would indeed help me out, complete the order & cook the pierogies for me. As I entered cop out it was a father daughter team in a kitchen cooking pierogies, not what I expected but I was happy to see it. As soon as I walked in Carl approached me with a hot off the skillet pierogie in a paper towel and told me this was a sample of what I would receive. I ordered a dozen of potato, cheddar & jalapeno (A cop out dozen is 14!) Not only did I receive excellent phone service, got a pierogie while I was waiting but I also got a few extra uncooked pierogies to take home for later with instructions all for under $10. This place is just awesome, I wish every business was still run this way. These pierogies were excellent and worth the drive, awesome homemade everything.   Taste - 5/5 Staff - 5/5 Helpfulness - 5/5 Selections - 5/5 Price - 5/5  Highly recommended!!!  Thanks Carl!!!",

Easy to find with accessible parking I would highly recommend for anyone who loves pierogies.  You can eat there or take home your pierogies to cook at home. I ate there yesterday with my brother and went back today so my husband could have some. Once he tasted his \"pepperoni pizza\" pierogies and one of my \"cheeseburger\" pierogies he understood.  Did I mention there are \"14\" in a dozen!  After eating my husband went next door to a hardwood store and picked up a couple items while I went next door on the other side and purchased chocolate at \"Pollock's\" home made candy store. What a nice experience we had today.  A word of caution there are just a few tables inside and they're high stools. But I was able to get a set two days in a row. Do yourself a favor and check it out! Loved it.",

Hell, I've even made halfway decent homemade ones before. But these are something special. Between the pierogies here and at Church Brew (please, please collaborate- if you make a beer can chicken with one of their brews, I'll never leave!) I'm in potato heaven. I snagged a dozen of their habanero/tequila/watermelon/chicken- hot damn! As soon as I got home, I made three per the instructions. The dough is top-notch, the filling is perfectly balanced and stuffed to the gills, and the flavors are impeccable. It's spicy, sweet, and fruity all at once. What a seasonal special. I'll be back for more, and I couldn't have asked for a better snack than the fried banana split 'rogie on my way out. Excellent food, overshadowed only by the kindness and hospitality of the establishment.",

We were greeted so nicely and the chef and the lady at the front counter. We spent a good 45 minutes talking and I sampled a few things he had in the works. Everything was really good. The gluten free was fantastic and the dessert pierogies were so so good as well. We got the Buffalo chicken and pot/kraut/bacon ones for dinner and then the cookies n cream for dessert (haven't made yet). The pot/kraut/bacon tasted like the new years meal my mom makes all in a pierogi. The buffalo chicken had a good kick to it and if I did it again would probably make a spicy sauce to go on them as well. We will make the dessert ones tomorrow.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves good Ole polish comfort food, or anyone who's never had a pierogi(yes, those people exist). Also bring cash or a check! Though PNC is right around the corner!",

But my life has now been changed by Carl and his wife, who are some of the nicest shop-owners we have ever met. Their pierogies and haluski were to-die-for when we ate them in the store. Carl whipped a few up for us to try - we tried the cherry cheesecake (INCREDIBLE), chicken parm, and haluski. Absolutely amazing. We bought a whole bunch and cooked some of them up. They didn't taste quite as yummy as they did when Carl prepared them...the dough was very thick. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if the ones he prepared were fresh rather than frozen, but I will definitely go back and try them again next time I'm in town! For the time being, I'd suggest having him whip them up for you - they were awfully tasty.",

We weren't sure what we wanted, but the people were nice enough to fry up a sample platter of 3 or 4 different ones.  They were all delicious, and we bought 2 bags of frozen ones to take home. The owners are very helpful in giving you cooking instructions if you are not familiar with cooking them. In my opinion, the best pierogies in a town full of them. Also a regular source so you don't have to wait until the local church has their yearly sale.  I haven't tried the dessert ones yet, but the sound very good.",

The shop itself is very small, consisting of a long counter for ordering, and a few tables for dining in (note: the dine-in hours are very limited, as are the hours in general, so be sure to check before you go). It seems to mostly do take out business for their frozen pierogies. They sell them in a \"cop's dozen\" (14 to a pack), with tons of flavors to choose from, ranging from the traditional (e.g., potato and cheese) to the modern (e.g., buffalo chicken, Thanksgiving dinner). Prices are very reasonable, ranging from $7.25 to $9.25 for the cop's dozen.  We opted to buy three flavors -- potato and cheese, chicken parm, and pepper butt (made with horseradish and pork butt from Parma in the Strip). We took our sacks of loot home and immediately cooked a few up. These are the real deal, people! The pierogie shells were perfectly tender, silken, and chewy without being too thick or doughy. There were generous amounts of flavorful fillings in each. The potato filling was smooth and delightfully cheesy in the traditional pierogies, while the chicken parm filling tasted remarkably like chicken parm! Lots of chicken, tomato sauce and cheese oozing out of each one. Delicious! I didn't try the pepper butt pierogie, but my husband simply kept repeating, \"Oh WOW,\" as he was devouring those, so I'm pretty sure they were a winner as well. I could definitely taste the homemade love baked into each one of these.  Our in-store experience was everything I love about supporting small businesses. The owner's wife helped us out, and she was wonderfully chatty and friendly, talking about her family, the neighborhood, and, of course, the pieorgies. Such a great experience. She even threw in a couple of extra free pierogies that were 'broken leftovers' so we could try another flavor (reuben) at home. So sweet!!   I do sort of wish that they sold their pierogies individually so that you could try all of their flavors without committing to an entire dozen. But since they mostly do frozen take out, I can see logistically why they don't. The owner's wife did say they are trying to expand into the store next door so they can be more of a restaurant, and I hope it works out for them!  They definitely have a fan in me, and I will be back next time I need to get my pierogie fix!",

I thought it was more of an actual restaurant, and less of a take-away-frozen-pierogies kind of place, so when we arrived it wasn't open for dining, but the owner cooked us up some pierogies anyway. The customer service was amazing. He even gave us some free dessert pierogies. There were so many different creative looking flavors...I wish I were able to try more! You can tell the owner is passionate and cares a great deal about the quality of his product. Even if the pierogies hadn't blown my mind, I would return just to support this guy. But the pierogies did blow my mind. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm going to come prepared with a cooler so I can fill it up with these little pieces of heaven.",

First of all, you'll be hard pressed to find a more generous, charismatic, kind hearted person in the whole world, and that love can be tasted in the food-- no doubt. As a newbie to the pierogie scene (thanks, Chef Boyfriend, for bringing these little joys into my life!) Carl pulled out all the stops and let us do a tasting of some of his greatest hits. All I can say is: woof! I can't believe I didn't break the chair!!   We had: - the classic potato and cheese - the Ruben (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foh.my&s=276e2ebc350073d2f8621da53e522ee7e0b3af05e71440977ab5e373881b8943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oh.my</a>.god) - the watermelon/jalapeno/chicken (say what?! Carl's homemade hot sauce takes it to the next level) - pepperoni pizza (brilliant!) - seafood (if Neptune were Polish, he'd eat these every day) - chicken marsala (woah!) - ... (this is right around the moment I blacked out into a coma of complete food bliss) OH! We also had some boss homemade noodles that are super traditional, but the name escapes me. I can tell you, though, I would gladly eat my body weight in those perfect, buttery, little treats.  Save yourself the time and trouble of making your pierogies at home, and GO SEE CARL!! The guy is a pierogie manic in the very best way. If Yelp says the shop is closed, just give him a call-- seriously, chances are he's there and he'll sling you a dozen (or two).",

It took me a few weeks to line up my schedule with theirs, but it was so worth it when I did. The owner's wife took care of me. She was super sweet and friendly, explaining how to cook the pierogies as well as giving me a set of printed instructions. I've never made/had pierogies before so this was very much appreciated! I was a few dollars short (bring cash!!) and instead of waiting for me to run around to find an ATM, she told me take them and when I protested she said \"just come back to visit\". With service like that, how could you not?!   The pierogies themselves perfectly complimented the spectacular service. I cooked them later that day for myself and a guest. We tried the buffalo chicken, Reuben, and lekvar (plum--tasted like a date paste) flavors. So. Good. The Reuben was my favorite but I have a feeling there's no such thing as a bad choice here!  I'll have to stop in to try more flavors and keep my promise. I think I'll even bring some home for the holidays!",

We decided to get the pilgrim (tastes like a thanksgiving dinner), and the hot sausage.. We decided for a while honestly because there's so many types! Both were awesome!

We stumbled upon this place, and it is one of the BEST gems I've discovered here in Pittsburgh. Their pierogies are so fresh, tender, and packed with flavor. We got the potato, cheddar & jalapeno ones and split them with my sister-in-law, and we were super satisfied.   Carl, the owner, came out several times to check on our dining experience. He first came out with a free sample of a dessert pierogi he finished making, \"tagalong girl scout cookie\" flavored. YUM!! He then came out later to serve us our main course and came out a few more times to make conversation and ensure we were enjoying our meal. My M-I-L had mentioned how it was our first time and how it would be nice to try some other flavors, and Carl asked us to hang around because he wanted to see what was in his kitchen. So he brought us out a few \"extras\" he had in the kitchen to sample - NO CHARGE! So we got to try the buffalo chicken and the breakfast pierogies too. Soooooo good! And so thoughtful of him. Way to go, Carl! Your service and kindness are unmatched.  Carl and the rest of the staff there made us feel super welcome and important, and I cannot wait to share my experience with my friends. We are DEFINITELY making more stops back to this place. Everyone needs to check out Cop Out Pierogies, it is seriously the BEST! :)",

Their pierogies will forever have a spot in my freezer, no joke, I will always have a stash. Cop Out is geared towards being a to-go place, especially since the pierogies are frozen and ready for you to take home. They do offer to cook them for you right there (w/ or w/o onions). However, there are only two small tables to sit at. So just as long as no one else beats you to it, you can eat there. But wait! It gets even better... Cop Out is BYOB. Did somebody say six pack and pierogies??  The selection here is out of this world! Anything you could ever want stuffed inside is available or can be available. They even have numerous dessert pierogies. I tried some samples of a cheesecake version with chocolate frosting and M&M's... O-M-G! Totally exceptional and unlike anything I've had before (more on that later). Cop Out has that awesome mom-and-pop shop vibe. The owner, is a retired police officer, he and his wife were the only ones there working on a Saturday afternoon. The wife was operating the register and taking orders, while her husband was making all the magic happen in the kitchen. Very cool spot, very old school, and so very Pittsburgh.  Now let me tell you about the most exceptional customer service I've ever received in my entire life! It was my first time at Cop Out. Upon entering, the owners wife greeted me and explained the menu. There were a few other patrons she was helping, as well. When I made my decision and finally ordered, she offered me the delicious samples I mentioned earlier! As if that wasn't enough, she boxed up a bunch for me to take home... free of charge. I sat in a high stool in the corner while I waited for my food, the wife chatted to us casually. She told us stories of how she met her husband and a little bit about the business. Her husband brought out some orders and introduced himself to everyone. They were both so friendly. It was a shock... you don't find hospitality like that in too many places these days. (Okay, let's be real... you can't find service like that anywhere.)  Then to top it all off, when my food was ready, as the wife handed me my order, she threw in an additional to-go container. All she said was \"My husband is doing a giveaway\". It was a large container of Haluski, again free of charge! She gave me some basic heating directions and sent me on my way. (When I say large, I mean it fed three adults dinner the following night and of course it tasted amaaaazing!) They left such a great impression on me, I had to share in length how amazing they were.   Please go here and meet them for yourself!",

I ordered a dozen hot sausage and a dozen reuben (frozen) to have later with dinner.  Well we just got finished eating and Wow....  I have made, bought, and eaten my fair share of pierogies over the years and these were some of the best.  I got to talk with the owner while I was there and he seems like a great person.  In fact he gave me half of his own sandwich as a sample of what he will be serving.  I will definitely be a returning customer, as the food is great and the owner is one hell of a stand up guy.",

You can order them either frozen to take home or have them fry them up there for you. I definitely recommend having them cook them for you, because the way they're fried up can't be beat!

A bunch of list of perogi on the counter when I walked in. I could of spent 80 bucks easily in that place. Everything looked really good, and it was! I took home some bomb stuffed cabbage, not just regular old stuffed cabbage either. This stuffed cabbage was a 9.8 good. Probably the best one I've ever had, and I've had quite a few.    Now to the perogi. I bought 2 bags (and the stuffed cabbage) for 20 or 25 bucks. Mac and cheese, and chicken marsala. She gave me a half dozen (at least) extra of a another flavor potato bacon blue cheese FOR FREE because I'd never been there, and they were spectacular. I brought it all home and made the PBBC. Mmmwah soooo perfect. I posted a pic of them with onions sauteed in butter and cottage cheese on the side (that's the way I eat all perogies) u should try it as a topping. I will go back and I would suggest yinz check it aaht*  *out in Pittsburghese",

Step 3: Eat some delicious prepared pierogies and fall in love. Step 4: Buy a huge amount of pierogies that will just barely fit in the carefully measured space in your freezer.  The reuben and gyro ones were fantastic, perfectly seasoned, and went really well with the provided sour cream. We also tried the jalapeno, potato, and cheese...we enjoyed these, but they were less standout (plenty spicy, though!). The dough was a perfect thickness--just a tiny bit chewy, and nicely steam-fried to crisp perfection.  If you want delicious, unique (and very affordable!) eats in a place that makes you feel like family on your first visit, head on down to Cop Out!",

We purchased a bag of a \"dozen\" (14) of each of the following flavors: * potato, bacon, and bleu cheese * chicken parmesan * gyro  Each of the above rang up for $9.25 per \"dozen,\" though the more traditional pierogies (potato, cheese, sauerkraut) are a couple bucks cheaper and the dessert pierogies are slightly cheaper.  Cop Out also offers seafood-filled pierogies that are quite a bit more expensive.  Lots of options.  Good flavors and quality ingredients.  It seems these handmade pierogies are prepared with care, with filling ingredients dispersed evenly throughout.  The directions provided--I went with the boiling technique and then pan-finished with margarine--were easy to follow and worked well, thank goodness; I'm no pierogie expert!   Cop Out is only open on Fridays and Saturdays and for a limited number of hours, so plan ahead.  We didn't realize the tight schedule until a few weeks before our Groupon expired and had to scramble to use the Groupon on the very last day.  Totally our fault, but just a heads up.",

    "text": "Thanks again yelp and yelpers with helping me to discover yet another obscure but amazing find Cop Out Pierogies!  I had just received my weekly email about places around the burg focused on Dumplings, particularly pierogies.  Growing up in and around the burg it is just about inconceivable that you didn't eat these plump pillows of carbs at least on a few occasions.  I always preferred the homemade to Mrs. T though she drives a hard bargain since honestly pierogies may not be the most complicated thing to make; they are certainly very laborious and somewhat complicated to get perfect.  When I say perfect I mean the taste and texture as no two homemade dumplings look alike.  Cop Out Pierogies can be found on Butler St in Etna which was very close to my work though I didn't know of its existence until the email arrived in my inbox.  I spoke to a couple of co-workers that week and decided that Friday we were going to get some takeout.  There are a couple things to keep in mind before heading to Cop Out Pierogies.  They are only open on Friday and Saturday for a few hours.  They are also cash only, so hit the ATM before you set out to get your fix.  Lastly, and perhaps this is a personal problem, I found it a little tricky to find them.  Etna is about as small as you can get but if you don't go there often you may pass it up once or twice before finding it.  I and my co-workers all ordered the same pierogies the potato/cheese/and jalapeno.  For a dozen they give you 14, not too shabby!  I also got a pint of Haluski.  The price for the pierogies does increase if you have them cook them for you.  I got the understanding quickly that most people buy them frozen in large bags.  When I arrived to pick up our food, I was greeted with a line of others waiting.  I didn't have to wait too long, but as I did the cook/owner brought out a couple samples of a sweet potato pierogies for the patrons waiting or eating in the small dining area they have set up.  Nice touch to ease the pain of my empty stomach suffering even more from the wonderful smell coming from the kitchen.  So they call this joint Cop Out and as I read online the owner/cook was a sergeant with the Shaler Township Police Department.  The decor was cute, some toy cop cars, lots of pics of the burg, some newspaper write ups that I could only imagine was of the store but I didn't get close enough to read them.  To complete this atmosphere was five on duty police officers enjoying lunch in the dining area.    Once waited on the food came out pretty quick, paid gave my thanks and off I went back to the office to enjoy my Polish lunch, and enjoy I did!  The pierogies were sauteed perfectly cooked with the creamiest smoothest texture encased inside the dumpling.  The spice from the jalapeno was nice and noticeable but definitely not overpowering.  They were in short delicious.  I could only finish half and took the rest home for dinner.  The Haluski was also very good but the pierogies stole the show for me.  Great stop if you find yourself in the area!",

I ordered a couple different pierogies to take home & try. And I also ordered 6 of the potato & cheese cooked to try there. The pierogies that I got cooked seemed a little doughy, I think they were not cooked long enough.  However at home I cooked up a dozen of the spinach & feta, I followed the directions I received when I purchased the pierogies. I fried them in butter till they were crispy on both sides. They came out PERFECT! They didn't have that doughy feel or taste to them. Absolutely delicious!! I can't wait to try the other flavors I bought! I love that they have many vegetarian flavors to choose from. Not just 1 or 2 chooses like so many other places. They have 5 or 6 vegetarian choices to choose from.  Also they give you 14 pierogies in a dozen. How awesome is that?! And prices are fair.  The lady taking your order & the owner are very friendly. The owner/chef gave my husband & I a dessert pierogie for free to try while we were placing our order. Strawberry cheesecake pierogie...delicious!  Definitely worth trying Cop Out Pierogies & worth making the drive to. You can always stock up & freeze them.",

    "text": "So I've had high expectations of this restaurant since reading the reviews.  I've been planning on visiting for months but never found the time and they do have limited hours.  Last Thursday, I finally found the time and to my delight, they were open.  I ordered their cheese-potato perogies and stuffed cabbage to go.    While waiting, the owner came out from the kitchen and introduced himself.  What a super nice gentleman!!  He offered me a cheesecake perogie dessert, Delicious!!  As many of you may know, he served as a police officer for many years.  After retiring, he opened up his restaurant.  He clearly has a passion and talent for cooking and their menu has a huge variety of perogies and to my surprise, stuffed cabbage.  I brought the food home and tried the perogies first!! Unbelievably delicious!! I had high expectations and they far exceeded them!!  Buttery, onion coated, perogies cooked to perfect!! Best perogies I've ever had!  I then took a taste of the stuffed cabbage. My grandmother made great stuffed cabbage!  These were the closest to my grandmother's I've ever tasted, and I've been to several Hungarian restaurants over the years!    So if you live anywhere near, you need to stop by!! You won't be disappointed.  Just check their hours in advance. I give them 5 stars without any hesitation!!",

    "text": "Very good handmade pierogies, cooked expertly to order with the right balance of slimy and crispy on the outside. And tasty onions too, if you order them there. With over-the-top friendly Pittsburgh-accented service. It's definitely become a Pittsburgh classic by now.  Not all of the flavors work so well as pierogies, though, in my view. I might be too much of a traditionalist, but the more avant-garde flavors, like peach pulled pork bbq, just overpower the essence of the dough to my taste. And the \"dessert pierogies\" are fried rather than grilled, which I think breaks a lot of the appeal of the texture.",

You can buy them frozen or they'll cook them up for you, in the spot, with an amazing amount of fried onions. To die for!!! We went with the traditional....a dozen cheese and potatoes and a dozen sauerkraut. So. Freaking. Delicious. Have I mentioned how much I love this place??? And the folks that run is are just as wonderful. If I lived near by I'd be so plump from eating there alllll of the time!!!   Remember to bring cash...they do not accept cards.",

I bought the mamas slip and Mac and cheese Pierogies.  The mamas slop Pierogies are heaven.  Loaded with flavor and I ate them with gravy to complement the chicken soup/pot pie feel of the Pierogies.  If you haven't tried this place then you're truly missing out.  One visit, 2 dozen Pierogies later and now a life long customer.  Just thank you for existing",

We got enough for two meals and I know after we eat the second batch we will be back for more. I would also like to go and get them hot to eat there in the restaurant. And I tried a sample of the strawberry cheesecake dessert pierogi and was to die for. The only thing that could have made it better was if it was slightly warm, which I'm sure it is if you order them for eat-in.   There is street parking, very easy to find a spot on a Friday afternoon. I was lucky to get a spot that still had 15 minutes left on the meter.",

My partner and I were coming back from a morning spent at the Pittsburgh Zoo and were looking for a place to eat on Yelp.  Being a huge fan of pierogies, we decided to stop by this place since it was close by and got great reviews.   There is not much indoor seating, but we lucked out and got a table.  They had a ton of different kind of pierogies ranging from your standard potato to interesting combinations like reubens or chicken marsala, but we settled on potato and cheddar.  14 come in a \"dozen\" and were quickly served to us with some delicious caramelized onions. These were the best pierogies we've ever had - fresh, amazingly tender, and so flavourful.   Do yourself a favor and stop in if you are ever in the Pittsburgh area.",

We have a family member who has celiac and they explained in detail about how they clean things before they do a gluten free run. Our family member was happy that he can now have pierogies. We also  got regular pierogies for the rest of us. We tried these and potato which were creamy inside with a tender outside dough. The mushroom and cabbage had a a lot of flavor and texture. They do not cook up the same as Mrs. T's so ask them about how you heat the frozen pierogies. You can also eat there. While they have a  huge selection of pierogies--more than you can imagine--you may want something different. With advance notice and a minimum of 3 dozen, they will make anything you desire. We are looking forward to them cooking our ramps with cheese into pierogies. We will definitely become regular customers.",
