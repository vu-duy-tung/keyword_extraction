    "text": "If you have a sweet tooth than this is the best place to get brunch in the Pittsburgh area. They have a cafe menu as well which is a dream come True for me. I think every brunch place should have an espresso machine and full coffee bar menu but that's another story. They have the place decorated very whimsical with books and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Kids would love this place. It is small but that's part of the appeal. The menu has a variety of sweet and savory products. I tried the stuffed french toast and was blown away. I can't wait to go back and try the tiramisu crepes.",

We waited 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't crowded (I got the Italian Job and my daughter got a waffle with Nutella).  Took maybe ten minutes to get a coffee order in.  That just isn't good enough to make me come here instead of Pamela's.  Also, it is weird to me that they have fancy coffee options but give out little creamers instead of real cream.  I hope they figure out their service problems because this place could be really good and the neighborhood really needs a great breakfast place.",

The staff is wonderful and the decor is beyond adorable.  However. :( The coffee menu could offer some more unique choices. The lattes are just vanilla, caramel, etc. I think they could make some interesting house syrups. I got a chai, and it wasn't very good. It was way, way too foamy and very weak. Warm cinnamon milk.  The menu had so many interesting things to choose from. There were so many things that sounded overly sweet though. I wanted something savory, with maybe a little sweetness. I ended up getting the smoked salmon crepe. Maybe I don't enjoy salmon as much as I thought, but the flavor of it was overpowering. It could have used a LOT more cream cheese. Or maybe an onion/herb cream cheese. Less salmon, maybe more capers and some tomatoes. I really didn't enjoy it but I ate what I could.  I really want this place to work everything out. I liked it immediately, but it could use some changes. I'll definitely give it another shot and get something sweet next time.",

The menu has the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I always go for the sweet and love their decadent crepes-they also have French toast and you can change any of the crepe options for waffles.  On my past visit I split the Tiramisu crepe with a friend.  It came with whipped cream, lady fingers, strawberries and cookie crumbles. I also wanted  a savory crepe and went with the Bonjour which had scrambled eggs, bacon (comes on top), and brie cheese. The savory crepes all come with a salad (except for the Bonjour which is served with fruit) that has a very tasty, light dressing on it.  The entrees look beautiful, taste delicious and are a hearty portion.  This place also serves ice cream and many coffee/tea drink options. They are BYOB and have the cutest decor inside.",

The service and staff is relaxed and the staff is happy - always a great sign. Started with coffee, high test and low octane - both wonderful. Mom had a crepe with salmon, cream cheese, capers etc. I had the Italian with a side of 2 eggs. Mom requested very light on the cheese, and that wish was complied with perfectly. She raved about the taste of the smoked salmon. My Italian crepe was wonderfully flavorful - really super pesto, nice mozzarella, veggies were all perfect. These are by far the best crepes I've had in Pittsburgh - light, good body, excellent tasting! Food was healthy, and not greasy at all.  This place was highly recommended to me, and I can see why.  I have a number of other items I'd like to try - waffles, pannini's, and more- as I said, I'll be back!!",

We had a darling little one by the window (sorry, had to let my inner grandma say it). Service was decent and I had the \"Universe's Favorite\" crepe; strawberries, mascarpone, cinnamon, whipped cream. What's not to like?? The only thing I found strange is that I asked for an iced tea and my waitress brought me a bottle of green tea. I didn't say anything about it being incorrect. After reading other reviews about it being fairly new, they are doing a pretty good job. Giving them a few months to work out the kinks, better train some wait staff, and fix the typos on the menu should get some higher stars at this place.",

It had egg and brie in it, with 3 pieces of bacon and maple syrup on top. He literally cleaned his plate.  I got the Eiffel crepe. It was filled with melted brie, then covered in maple syrup and walnuts, with whipped cream on the side. Seriously the best crepe I've ever had. It was earthy, sweet, crunchy, absolutely perfect.  We sat at a table where I could see the food being prepared. They weren't just slapping a bunch of food on a plate and rushing it out to you. They slowly and deliberately added the ingredients on the plate, making sure it was beautiful and tasty. I watched a chef adding cut up tomatos to a sandwich (panini?). She placed each piece one at a time, spread out on the sandwich. You can tell they really care about their food. We will definitely be back! A True gem in Lawrenceville",

The sandwich was accompanied by a side salad with a vinaigrette dressing. This is a great place for breakfast or lunch.

It'd be a shame to pass by this welcoming little cafe and never step in to try it out. They specialize in Crepes, and for VERY good reason: the crepes here are both huge and loaded with exceptionally fresh ingredients. I ordered the Gone Fishin' Crepe, and I fell in love. Delicious Smoked Salmon filled the enormous crepe, as well as capers, caramelized onions, and cream cheese. And the London Fog Latte I had with it was one of the best lattes I've ever had... And trust me, I've had A LOTTA lattes! The decor lives up to the cafe's namesake: Several pinnochio marionettes adorn the walls, books dangle from strings from the ceiling, and a tiny Geppetto figurine sits in the window to welcome passerby. Last but not least, the waitstaff was warm and attentive. The people here make the cafe as inviting as can be! I'll definitely be back!",

My boyfriend had the raspberry and goat cheese french toast (the best french toast both of us had ever had - the combination of flavors is incredible!) and I had the Tiramisu crepe - also delicious! We both got a side of \"crispy\" bacon and it was cooked to perfection.   Why it's 4 stars instead of 5: The staff was cold and rude. At first, we thought it was just awkwardness but as the meal went on, we got the vibe that nobody wanted to be there. Even our waitress, Kiana, seemed like she would rather be doing anything else - seeming frustrated at us that we immediately didn't know what we wanted, that she had to add the note \"crispy\" to our side of bacon and hardly checked on us besides taking our order. We had to stare at her while she was texting at the counter to get our bill a while after we were obviously done.",

When you check in the offer pops up with a build your own crepe starting at $4.00 as opposed to the menu where it starts at $4.50. I showed this to my waiter who told me that it starts at $4.50. When you go to redeem it just calls their phone number.  Nevertheless onto the food itself. It serves paninis, crepes for both breakfast, lunch, and dessert along with waffles. You can order a premade one right off the menu or like I did build it with you favorite items. I choose chicken, various vegetables, and a not too spicy topping. All lunch menu items come with a side salad. The crepes are huge but very good.  The crepes are fresh and made well. It is quite filling that unless you are very hungry don't expect to be able to finish more than one. They also serve sweet crepes with nutella or other toppings you would enjoy for a dessert.  There is a pay parking lot nearby along with bike parking.  It has a charming atmosphere with books hanging from the ceiling and Pinocchio is there to greet you when you walk in along with his story book.",

Perhaps an unremembered  bit from Pinnochio would explain books hanging from the ceiling by string. Quirky, but nice. The staff were great and very attentive. The coffee and tea blends were both very good. The house special waffle and challah french toast with sauted apples and caramel were good, but not excellent. The waffle was a bit chewy when I was hoping for crisp. Overall a positive experience.",

The interior has a cafe feel to it and local art for sale on the walls.  Definitely will add to my list of possible brunch date spots.

    "text": "Finally, I came here. Finally! Chris has been coming here since they opened and is a regular. When we opened the door he was greeted warmly. They remembered his coffee order and what his usual food order is. It was hilarious. I always knew he came here a lot, but I didn't realize it was that much. We live close to the Cafe but with me usually working weekends I have not been able to make it to eat. Chris on the other hand apparently made friends. For my first time I was impressed. I love the space. I liked the books hanging from the ceiling and I liked that the place just looked bright and clean. Their food was also amazing. The service was also really nice. I feel like we got seated right away and they kept an eye on us the entire time.   Savory Crepes: For my first time here I went with the Prosciutto Savory Crepe: Fresh Mozzarella, proscuitto, and honey aioli with a side salad. I ate half. It was that big and that stuffed full of goodness that I could only eat half! It was a perfect blend of cheese and meat. The only suggestion or change I would make would be to ask for a little less of the honey aioli or maybe ask for it to be put on the side. While good, it sometimes took over the taste of the entire crepe. I would suggest this to anyone visiting in the Lawrenceville area.   Sweet Crepes: Nutella Classic: Nutella, fresh strawberries, banana, and whipped creme. This is the one that Chris ordered. He, weirdly asked for less nutella. I mean who does that? I would usually say, \"Please sir, can I have some more nutella\" but he said that it sometimes overpowers the crepe so less is still enough. I will say, he was right. Whatever amount of nutella they put on that crepe was good. The strawberries and bananas were so fresh and crisp tasting. Nothing frozen about them. The whipped creme was also really good. It held up and was super refreshing when you would, lets say, dip a strawberry hunk or banana chunk in it. YUM. This crepe we did finish. I say we because he let me eat about 1/4th of it. I just couldn't help myself! I had my savory crepe and then had to eat some of his for dessert.   Coffee Selection: Iced Carmel Latte: Yum. Brewed to perfection. Not overly sweet and no weird burnt taste of coffee that I have had some other places.   I am looking forward to my next weekend off. I want to come back and try more of the menu. I will probably go for another savory crepe (since I know Chris will go for a sweet one). I am now looking over the menu trying to plot out my next brunch!   I really enjoyed my time here. It was quick and easy to get in and out and the food was really good. I ended up eating my crepe the next day for lunch. Totally worth it. Yum!",

The iced coffee was also great. I was worried they might throw some sugar and cream in there but thankfully they didn't. I like my coffee like Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks does \"Black as midnight on a moonless night.\" I got a menu with my order and looked it over and am very excited to go back and try some crepes and tea from Gryphons tea is always a plus too. After all, what is so wrong that can't be solved by a nice cup of tea?   Overall this place is a great addition to Lawrenceville!",

We were seated right away and the staff right away brought a high chair for my daughter. The menu is amazing with crepes paninis different kinds of challah French toast and specialty coffee and espresso drinks. This is not a place you need a kids menu because everything is pretty much kid friendly. The waiter immediately brought us crayons and a paper for my daughter to color  with while we looked over the menu. Our food took normal time not fast but not super slow either to get to us. I ordered the sandwich with fried eggs, honey aioli, and Gouda cheese (skipped bacon) which came with a side salad to split with my friend and for my bebe a smoothie and challah French toast classic with a generous side of strawberries.  Everything was tasty ! One thing I have to say that really made me love this place was how sweet the staff was. Everyone was so helpful and when my daughter dropped something or spilled water they were there to help. I don't know what it is but it felt really friendly and whenever I eat out with my kids I always feel so uncomfortable how they make a mess and I'm constantly picking the stuff they throw and feel like I'm getting dirty looks from the staff , but but they really made me and my kid feel welcome. Thank you guys! Btw they have a full pumpkin seasonal drink menu I immediately regretted not trying after I finished my meal. Can't wait to come back again!",

    "text": "As a lover of all things brunch, I had to stop by and give Geppetto a try.  From the outside, it's easy to miss the cafe in the busy section of Lawrenceville. Slow down, walk in and wait to be greeted and seated.   The fight between brunch and dessert is hard as soon as you see they carry a selection of Perry's Ice Cream, at only $2 per scoop.  I really wanted to try their brunch food, so I ignored the ice cream and ordered an iced coffee instead. It was smooth and fresh. The coffee was so balanced that it didn't really need sugar or cream to be refreshing.   I ordered the Ultimate French Toast (Challah bread with whipped cream, and strawberries). The fresh bread was thick and perfectly browned in butter, with enough spices to enhance, but not overpower. The whipped cream and strawberries were present, but not to the extent that I would have named this dish \"ultimate\". The strawberries were a bit flavorless (no surprising since they aren't in season), but I didn't regret choosing the topping I wanted.   The server was cordial, but didn't hover. And the other guests were quiet, considering the number of people in the cafe.  The bathrooms were clean and had more stalls than I expected.   This cafe accepts cards and Apple Pay, which I greatly appreciated.   Finally, the reason I took a star is the cleanliness of the dining area. My table was sticky and had crumbs on it before I sat down. And I spent the entirety of my meal shooing a fly from my french toast. I wanted to eat slowly and enjoy my food, but the fly wouldn't let me.",

Service is consistently good, and your food comes out pretty quickly for how busy they tend to be.   My favorite items on the menu are the Love Hate Thing (the smoked turkey savory crepe) and their French toast is amazing. However, nothing I've had from here has ever been a disappointment.",

I mean, who doesn't love a warm little blanket swaddling their favorite sweet or savory treats?  Those non-believers can't be trusted, I'll tell you that much.  Geppetto Cafe is amazing.  As I waited for my prosciutto crepe, I remarked to my dining companions how the ambiance made me feel like I was on vacation.  It's located right in the middle of one of Pittsburgh's most up and coming neighborhoods, but this quaint cafe removes you from the hustle and bustle.   I felt like I knew the staff for years, they were so warm, cheery, and welcoming.  And fast!! My beautifully garnished crepe was in front of me before I knew it and it was nothing short of heavenly. I don't dabble in sweet crepes, since I'm not big on sweets to begin with... but I was so thrilled with my order that it made me want to order one of everything off their menu!  I'm looking forward to coming back again and again to work my way through their artfully crafted menu.  They surely know what they are doing here, are passionate about their food, and it radiates from the moment you walk in the door.  Fun fact:  the owner and his partner had a hand in all of the construction of their beautiful space, including the stunning wood floor, made from pallets!  Hence, they named it after the wonderful co-star of Pinocchio, Geppetto the carpenter!",

    "text": "Wow!! This is the place for a great breakfast/brunch!  Four of us came for what we hoped to be a good brunch on a gloomy, overcast day in Pittsburgh. All four us left feeling gluttonous yet incredibly content and wishing we could eat more.   Three of our oders came with a small, crisp, fresh salad dressed perfectly with a dressing I wish I had bottles of. It had a light, citrus flavor that made us all eat the salad even though none of us planned on it. The french toast sandwich with bacon egg and cheese was a great blend of sweet and savory - from the slightly sweet bacon, to the hearty eggs with their slightly runny yolks (at my request), layered with a bit of smoked Gouda that married the flavors so well. This was layed between two slices of warm, fluffy, delicious french toast. It was wonderful.  The chicken and Gruyere Cheese crepe was very good. It had carmelized onions and their own spicy sauce, but it wasn't spicy; it tasted like a very good, balanced combination of ranch, buffalo sauce, and ketchup. It's not a combination I would have ever used, and I could be wrong about what it was, but it worked.   The Bonjour crepe consisted of scrambled eggs, brie, applewood smoked bacon, served with a side of fresh fruit and syrup. It didn't last long enough for me to try a bite but the fussy eater that ordered it assured me that it was fantastic.   We puchased Geppetto's signature crepe for the table and that too was incredibly satisfying. Sauteed carmelized apples that were sweet, but not overly so, a light cream cheese glaze, a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon, and a touch of caramel sauce made it a breakfast treat that I want to order again soon...and I don't even like caramel.   The iced tea needs to be bottled and sold commercially. It was that good.   The house coffee was okay, but there were several other coffee options to choose from too.  The service - excellent. Truly friendly, helpful, attentive and engaging. The server was always there for whatever the patrons needed, but didn't hover over any of the tables. The overall atmosphere was laid back, welcoming, and just comfortable. Everyone loved it and can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

I'm also a big fan of the decor and the usage of space. Although a rather small dining area, the establishment definitely makes the best of it with the seating arrangement.  Lastly, say what you want about me, but I'm a fan of the tablecloths. I think that they really fit well with the overall feel good atmosphere of this restaurant.

The atmosphere is quirky casual; random and eclectic things decorate every inch of the restaurant, from the cute umbrellas and books hanging from the ceilings, to the little metal carriages that hold the salts and peppers, to the large Banksy painting by the bathrooms. If you enjoy crepes, they have great options for both sweet and savory tastes. The merry berry is my regular choice; Nutella + berries + the GOOD whipped cream = BEST! The coffee is also fantastic; great cappuccino (and they serve it with a cute tiny whisk!). I've been a repeat customer for months now and definitely don't plan to change that! Definitely one of the gems of Lawrenceville.",

I wanted to yank down a few to read, but fortunately I was kept in check.  Great options for vegetarians are available.   Besides the crepes, I ordered a smoothie that was terrific.",

So I was very pleased to have been able to enjoy an elite event here (boo on me not knowing about Geppetto's existence).  So since then I have been there two more times and have fallen in love with them even more every time I go.  So crepe wise, you can choose between savory and sweet crepes. I tend to actually go for both, just depends on how hungry I am and my mood. My two favorite savory crepes are the Ham and Cheese and the Love Hate Thing. The ham and cheese consists of ham, gruyere cheese and set off by a wonderful honey aioli. The Love Hate Thing consists of Smoked Turkey, goat cheese, avacado and a bachamel sauce.   My favorite sweet crepes are the Eiffel and the Tiramisu. The eiffel is absolutely wonderful. It has brie, walnuts, maple syrup and a wonderful homemade whipped cream. the tiramisu consists of marscapone, lady fingers, strawberries, chocolate and whipped cream.   They also have challah french toast. The only one I have tried was the smores. It had marshmallows, nutella and graham crackers. It was delicious!  The service is also absolutely wonderful and everyone is always so nice and helpful!  If you are ever on Butler, I absolutely recommend stoping here!",

It was a waffle stacked with a cream cheese maple spread with some backed cinnamon apples on top and if I am not mistaken, a little drizzle of caramel.  Holy Moly!  All of those flavors were amazing together.  The waffle itself was perfectly cooked and the portion and ratio of topping was just enough, not overwhelming.  There is a lot going on on that waffle, but it all worked.    Side Note:  We did order the bacon side.  it was a little wimpy for the price.   Also, don't forget to turn over the menu for the French toast options.",

I ordered the chicken crepe with Gruyere, caramelized onions and a spicy sauce! I don't eat crepes too often so I wasn't sure how filling it was going to be! I was stuffed! The crepe also came with a side salad that offered a good brightness to the dish that was certainly welcome! The crepe itself was perfectly thin and the filling was hardy! My friend got the monte cristo and really enjoyed it as well! Also, the prices were incredibly fair! Both of our meals were around $10 each!

    "text": "Well I was a little disappointed after leaving Geppetto Cafe today. I had high hopes for this place after reading other reviews.   First I would like to start by saying I really did love the decor of this place. I can easily be swept in by rustic interiors and industrialized fixtures. It is a rather small place and I wouldn't say it's a good place for large groups.   I think the menu has a lot of nice options, savory crepes, sweet crepes, waffles, french toast, etc. You can also build your own crepe or waffle starting at $4. Personally I wouldn't go this route because it can really add up with all the different topping selections. I ended up spending $14 on my crepe and orange juice (not including the tip). Had I had a better experience, I would consider returning.   For my meal I ordered the Bonjour crepe. I really did enjoy this. However, the menu was very misleading. It came with a side of fruit and this was extremely small. Also, at the top of the menu it says \"All savory crepes come with a side salad\", but when my crepe arrived 40 minutes later there was no salad on the plate. In my opinion, 40 minutes for a crepe to arrive is a little out of hand.   I noticed as I waited for my food the place started smelling of grease. It got to the point where the workers turned the fans on and opened the back door. Needless to say I left cold and smelling like a grease ball.",

I also got a latte, which was delicious and came with a cute little heart in it. My friend ordered the \"Nutella Classic\", really great sweet crepe.

They not only take your name, but also your phone number, so go shop at Wildcard down the street until the \"Table is ready\" call and everyone wins!  I obsessively stared at the menu on my phone before arrival and again when we were seated. So many options. Savory and sweet crepes, French toasts and paninis. I finally decided on the Chicken and Gruyere Cheese crepe with a side of eggs. The crepe had caramelized onions and a homemade spicy sauce. (I'm a huge baby when it comes to spicy stuff, but my server assured me that I would be able to handle it.  And she was right.) I was worried that I would still be hungry after, because how filling can a crepe really be? That was certainly not an issue. I probably could've taken half home, but it was so delicious that I decided to just go for it. I also had a bite of my friend's Eiffel crepe- Brie cheese, walnut, maple syrup & whipped cream. I'm not big on sweets for breakfast but YUM!   This place is going to do very well in Lawrenceville and I suggest you go check it out!",

The small city that has its roots in the crude steel industry; but the small city that recently began to experience a major cultural and culinary boom. I was sure Geppeto was gonna be part of that. It was even in Lawrenceville, the heart and major happening point of said boom. Alas, it was good. But it is a prime example of the disappointment (albeit a small one) of setting one's hopes too high.   The crepe was the Chicken and the Gruyere. It was a good morsel. It even satisfied my crepe longings but it didn't leave me longing for another taste. The decor is acceptable with its much-publicized books hanging from the ceiling, rugged brick and plaster walls with nooks with Pinocchio puppets, and VW bus graphics. Huh?  Oh well, in the end, I would still tell anyone to go here. And I bet it will improve with age. But maybe my slightly unfulfilled expectations along with Geppeto's undeniable quality is proof of just how great Pittsburgh has really become.",

    "text": "Geppetto is the most perfect place I have eaten at in awhile. I have been bored with food lately because I get into the same old habits of going to my regular places. My buddy insisted we go here for brunch one day, and I happily obliged. The decor is immediately noticeable. It's warm, charming and comforting. I'm trying not to use the same words David B. (Hi David) used, but it's True. Everything from the dangling books to the little lights on the wall, polka-dot tablecloths and menus, is perfectly adorable. I feel like I should dress up to come here just to match the cuteness.  With that said, Geppetto doesn't just deliver on aesthetics. The food is hella good too. When I say it is some of the most delicious food I've had in awhile, I am saying that as a person who has dulled tastebuds and pickiness about texture. I have lots of NEEDS when it comes to what I eat, and nothing I ate here disappointed me.   The three of us ordered a variety of dishes so we could all share, some sweet and some savory. Collectively we ordered the Troy, Chicken and Gruyere, The Geppetto Signature and one other I seem to be forgetting. The Troy was surprisingly more delicious than I expected, because I didn't think hummus would be good on a crepe. I was wrong. It was satisfying and flavorful in the best way. The signature was of course, perfect too.   The staff here is also phenomenal. They are kind, not intrusive, quick, and attentive. What more could you ask for?   Geppetto Cafe is magical, and I hope it is here for a long time to come. I'm not sure I can live without it now!",

There was a little bit of a wait, but that's understandable for the time of day, and its size. Everyone was friendly, and considerate! It was not anymore expensive or inexpensive than the standard restaurant or cafe. The offer a great variety and selection of food and treats! They have both sweet and savory foods that can satisfy anyone! I cannot wait to stop back, and try some gelato",

Everything was GREAT! I can't express how much I like them. And I don't think you can go wrong on anything there. The only think I can complain about is the waiting/check-in system. They always had a line and they will take your name when you get there and call your name when there is a table ready. BUT since this place is kinda modern to me and I think they should update this to let people get in line electronically upon arrival like get on Nowait.  It will save there time and make customer happier also look good for the store since the entrance area is very small, usually it would only take four people to block the whole entrance. It would be fine If it is summer that people can wait outside, but in the winter, I'm not staying outside... anyway, great place great food and I love it!",

The service was very fast considering how busy it was, they know how to work a brunch crowd!   I got the smoked salmon crepe, which was decent, and my boyfriend got the ham and cheese crepe which he absolutely loved. I have never been a huge fan of crepes so that is something to consider.

They have so many amazing options that I was actually staring at the menu for close to an hour before I could decide. Of course the golden rule when you can't pick one thing is you just order them all (that's how it goes, right?)  Starting with a savory crepe, I went with the Troy which is filled with hummus, feta, caramelized onions, and spinach - absolutely amazing! The sweetness from the onions paired really well with the more savory hummus and feta. The only critique would be to add more hummus because more hummus is always better. All the savory crepes come with a small side of mixed greens as well for some extra health.   Of course I can't have a savory crepe without a sweet crepe to follow. They have some crazy dessert crepes with fruit, nutella, caramelized apples, you name it. I decided to keep it simple and go for the Cheap Date which is just a plain crepe topped with butter, brown sugar, and whipped cream. Really quick and simple but sooo delicious.",

All savory crepes come with a side salad which is also good. My friend had the raspberry goat cheese French toast which was also awesome. 10/10 will go again.",

Thankfully, the staff was quick to address the issue when it was mentioned. Overall the staff was attentive, but busy, leading to an average service experience. Not bad, just not great. There are a wide variety of menu options to fit any taste. My wife and I had the banoffe crepe and the cheap date waffle and we split the chicken pesto panini. The waffle and crepe were brought before the sandwich for some reason. There was enough delay to finish the initial entrees before receiving the panini. The waffle was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with an excellent mix of flavors. The crepe was OK, but the dulce de leche seemed more like caramel syrup than anything else. The chicken pesto sandwich had great flavor, but the sandwich was only warm not hot when served. Unfortunately toward the end, I encountered some avocado that was not yet ripe. Overall the brunch was good and I would come back to try it again.",

On a recent Saturday morning, my BF and I decided to walk over from Millvale to feel like tourists in another city, and we had just a brief 15 minute wait on a table.   Yes, there are Pinocchio puppets around, but not enough to qualify as creepy.  The book and umbrella ceiling installations add a touch of whimsy.  Oh yeah, and the food? Fabulous.  We each got our own savory crepe (Bonjour and House of Crepes) and sampled the other's, plus we split a sweet \"Cheap Date\" with bananas added. It was all excellent, especially the House of Crepes.  The real knock-out surprise was the coffee, though.  It. was. awesome. Dark, rich, and flavorful without being too bitter. I had to stop myself after 2 refills!  A sweet added bonus to the meal was that one of the employees played violin for a little bit, which was an unexpectedly cute and romantic touch on a random Saturday morning.  This was such a great experience, and I look forward to going back sometime!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Sunday with my wife for brunch shortly after noon.  They were on a wait at this point and told us that it would be quick, like 20 minutes, and so we joined the list with 3 other tables in front of us.  It ended up taking around 28 minutes for us to get seated.  The inside of this restaurant is shaped like a skinny rectangle with a counter area taking up a chunk of the front with seating beside and behind it.  It is decorated in a fun fashion with lots of cool lights, children's umbrellas hanging from one portion of the ceiling and books from another.  In honor of its namesake they are have a bunch of pinnoccio dolls hanging off the lights.  For brunch on this day I decided to go with the chicken and gruyere cheese crepe while my wife went with the house of crepes.  Then for dessert we decided to split the cheesecake waffle sans white chocolate.  The menu described my crepe as roasted chicken, gruyere cheese, caramelized onions and homemade spicy sauce and my wife's crepe as Canadian ham, Gouda cheese, mushroom and honey aioli.  The savory crepes came with side salads which was nice as it made the meal feel a bit healthier.  My side salad was flavorful as well with a healthy amount of a nice and tangy dressing on it.   For me it was perfect but I can imagine others might think that it was overdressed.  My crepe here was also good and I was pleasantly surprised by how much chicken and other ingredients they got into it.  The crepe itself was light and fluffy and provided a good place for all the fillings while the roasted chicken was moist and the gruyere added a nice savory taste to the dish.  My favorite part of the dish was the spicy sauce though which added some wetness to the dish as well as a nice lingering spice that let you know it was there without being too spicy.  Our dessert ended up being a waffle with ricotta cheese and raspberry compote.  The waffle itself was crispy and stood up to the toppings on it.  Meanwhile the toppings were sweet which was nice for a bit but by the end I found it to be too sweet and really wished that there had been some more sharpness from the raspberry compote.  The bottom line for me is that I would back here again in the future.  Our server was friendly and I was impressed by the amount of fillings that they got inside of their crepes.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the NUTELLA & FRUIT CREPES ARE AMAZING! So good  (but a lil expensive)! This is why they get 4 stars!    This is why they didn't get the 5th star:  We arrived around 12:30 & they were slightly busy. The front area is really small and it took them a few minutes to notice us waiting. Luckily once they noticed us, we were seated immediately. There was a large group of ladies who had the waiter split the bill 3 or 4 ways and there were some issues so he was occupied for at least 20 minutes. Y'all heard of cash or Venmo?? The poor lady server was serving the entire dining room!   Despite this, I feel like the servers could have checked in with the diners while they were waiting for food. They took our order, served the food & got the check.  Maybe because we came around lunchtime it was busy, but it took 45 minutes for two crepes to arrive. That's insane especially for those who only have 1 hour for lunch!   Also who has a shipment arrive in the middle of lunch? These two dudes came straight through the dining room with huge trolleys and had to ask a few people to move their chairs. In my opinion, that's so unprofessional! Maybe have them deliver during down time, not during the predictably busy lunchtime.   Conclusion: Will return for the crepes - I think it's worth the almost $9 price - but will keep my expectations low on the service.",

However, if I said it wasn't worth the wait, my nose would surely grow.  The interior is adorable, everywhere you look there is something interesting going on. They put a lot of thought into the decor despite the small space. Their menu offers both sweet and savory options. So you have a variety to choose from. I went with a savory crepe (I always go savory), but totally plan to try something sweet next time. They also served up a great chai latte. I appreciate when brunch place offers more than just a plain coffee.  It was hard to decide what to order, because everything looks and sounds amazing. Can't wait to get back here and give something else a go.",

    "text": "What can I say, other than that Geppetto Cafe is wonderful! This cozy little shop makes a variety of sweet and savory crepes, and all of them are superb. They also serve up waffles and French toast (made with Mancini challah bread), plus salads and panini for people who just aren't craving some breakfast/brunch food. Plus, milkshakes! It's a fantastic spread of options, making this place a great go-to for a group with a variety of tastes. I've never wanted to order off-menu, I love the cafe's recipes so much - but if nothing strikes your fancy during your visit, there is also the option to make your own meal.  No matter what you get, you're promised fresh and flavorful ingredients, and so far I've been able to taste that promise always being kept! All of my meals here have downright delighted me, from the Bella crepe (with mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese) to the Nutella Classic crepe (piled high with Nutella and fruit). Although I must say, the Chicken-and-Gruyere crepe has surprisingly been my favorite thus far - surprisingly because I have quite the sweet tooth. But with its tender chicken, caramelized onions and melted cheese, this is one savory crepe that I can't resist! Plus, the savory crepes come with a side of field greens topped with cherry tomatoes and vinaigrette - they're perfect to share if you aren't quite hungry enough to take on these delicious but enormous concoctions. (The sweet crepes come with whipped cream, in case you're wondering.)  The decor adds to the delightful charm of the place, by the way - books are strung from a tin ceiling, while wooden marionettes and tiny potted plants hang on one of the walls. I always feel welcome when I arrive, and I always leave full and happy. I highly recommend this darling little eatery to everyone, and by the way, can you take me with you when you visit it?",

I had the Bonjour crepe which is crepe stuffed with scrambled eggs and brie cheese. It was topped with bacon and served with a side of fresh fruit and maple syrup. I loved how the fruit salad included a wide variety of fruits like strawberries, blueberries, pineapple and grapes. Typically when you get a side of mixed fruit it's just melons, cantaloupes and pineapples. The crepe was very well prepared however the brie was a little bit to strong and bitter for my liking. I think the dish would work better with a milder cheese like cheddar. All in all it was a good experience and a great meal.",

I was on my way down to the Strip when I realized that I needed cash for where I had in mind, so I parked right in front of Geppetto to stop at the nearby Citizens Bank. For whatever reason, Geppetto felt welcoming right at that moment, so I skipped the ATM and ambled inside. I settled in at a window table and received the friendliest service with a spot-on recommendation for the chicken and Gruyere crepe, which was accompanied by a light mixed greens salad and accented by a spicy Sriracha-based sauce on top. I happily lingered over a book and my coffee (refills for days) as the summer sunshine poured in. Will definitely be back with friends for future Sunday brunches!",

I think they might have room for a few bar stools for single diners, but I didn't see any. I was happy to see that they stick to french toast, waffles and crepes without trying to offer too many diner style sides. So much better than a place like Waffles Incaffeinated!",

The coffee is amazing even a generic cup is phenomenal. The bathrooms are the real problem styled with stained tiles on the ceiling and smelling of wet dog I would suggest finding other options. The seating is super strange. The bar style kitchen has taken most of the front area and patrons are placed in the back behind the kitchen. The BYOB part did make me very happy.

    "text": "Went here for the first time for brunch today. The store is super cute and cozy, and service was very attentive and friendly. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 2, not bad for 11:30am on a Saturday. I ordered the chicken and gruyere crepe which was really good. The homemade spicy cause was creamy, tangy and delicious. It complemented the caramelized onions and cheese well, and the crepe was just saucy enough to not be dry. I will definitely order it again! My boyfriend got the Love Hate Thing, a savory crepe with turkey, goat cheese avocado and bechamel sauce. He substituted salmon for the turkey. Unfortunately, I think the goat cheese made this crepe too dry, and the bechamel sauce didn't add enough flavor or moisture. Generally, I would stick with gruyere or mozzarella in a crepe anyways, seems like the crumbly cheeses are too dry for crepe fillings. Both came with a good mixed greens side salad. I'd easily give the Chicken and Gruyere 5 stars, but the Love Hate Thing earned 3 stars at the most. You can also make your own crepes, but it seems really pricey to do so since each veggies is about $1.50, each meat is $3, cheese is $2 and sauces are $1 with the base price of each crepe $4. So making my Chicken and Guyere would have been $11.50 instead of $9.50. Also, the Turkish coffee was too watery but the drip coffee was good. Will definitely be back to try more crepes, hopefully saving room for a sweet crepe next time!",

    "text": "I visited Geppetto last weekend with my boyfriend. We were happy to get seated right away, since it can be hard to get a table for brunch in Lawrenceville. My boyfriend had the french toast, and added an egg and bacon. I had the salmon crepe and added a dippy egg and bacon. They have pre-made crepes, as well as a make your own crepe, however I found that once I totaled up all of the items for my possible make my own crepe it got pricey, so I decided to go with the pre-made salmon crepe. I was also hoping there would be more options for breakfast style crepes as well, (with eggs in them) however there was only 1 \"breakfast crepe\" on the menu.   Everyone was very nice there, but I could tell that they are working everything out still with being such a new restaurant. Our food arrived and they seemed to have had a mix up with my boyfriends eggs, or forgotten them, so he had to wait for them to be cooked. It only took a few min, so not a huge deal. My salmon crepe was good, however it was a little dry. It had a cream cheese in it, and I agree with one of the other reviewers on here that said the dry cheeses don't seem to work as well in the crepes, at least without some kind of sauce on top. The dippy egg helped a little. It came with a side salad and I added my side of bacon. I hate to say that the bacon was horrible, but there are some really good butchers around here, so I have to say it. It was super, super thin and greasy. Next time, I would forego adding it on. Some people may like it that way I suppose, but I prefer thick cut bacon, this bacon was falling apart because it was so thin. My boyfriends french toast was good, but he had the same comments about the bacon. My crepe was pretty large as well. My boyfriends french toast was a decent size, but nothing crazy.  We will definitely be back to check it out again, I foresee them working out a few things and overall becoming a nice addition to Lawrenceville.",

The spot is really cute--sort of an eclectic & urban-rustic-chic thing going on.   Their waffles and crepes are both particularly awesome, with plenty of savory and sweet options. If you don't like one of the combinations they have on the menu, you can also build your own. Really like the Super Veg crepe, which is filled with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and just a little bit of bechamel sauce. Served with a delicious side salad, it was an awesome brunch choice. Their waffles are dense and sweet, with well-carmelized exterior and chewy interior. Their eggs and bacon are both excellent.  Their coffee options are also delicious and a step above a few other local breakfast spots. But. But. The only \"cream\" option they serve with your coffee are those awful little coffee creamer cups. I can't think that small pitchers of actual half-and-half would be that much more difficult to serve.  We did have some service issues during early visits where it took quite awhile to get our food, but they seem to be getting better. It's probably wise to assume it will take a bit longer than normal to get your food, though.",

Had the french toast with bananas, sweet cream, and a side order of bacon. Clientele are mostly hipsters with a sprinkling of seniors, and famlies. You won't leave hungry. The interior is funky but still having some of the original decor from the 1900\"s. On street pay parking.",

The coffee was good but you couldn't get a refill. Also the crepes are awesome. The problem is entirely the service.  --edit Gave this place another shot today. The food is still great and the service improved dramatically. It seems like there is way more staff or maybe the staff just changed and got much better.",

    "text": "We went late, around 2pm on a Saturday, and thus were quickly seated. The staff was unusually young. Our French waiter was quite nice and attentive. Brought us coffee and water quickly. The menu was filled with a large variety of delicious looking sweet and savory crepes and French toast. I opted for the ham and gruyere cheese savory crepe with an egg added in for starters. The crepe itself was soft and flavorful, and the honey aioli was the creamy sweet complement that put it over the top. I probably should have stopped there; my stomach even warned me so. But I followed this up with their Banofe crepe, covered with walnuts, bananas and chocolate sauce. This was a sweet overload for someone who hasn't been eating too much sugar in recent months. But all the same it was delicious. These were nearly as good as my crepes at Little Breizh's in Paris.  I wasn't thrilled with my seat as there was a broom closet behind me that the staff occasionally had to enter. But it was a cute place, and the the three staff members we spoke with were all very hospitable. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good creperie.",

There are books hanging from the ceiling. It all creates a very charming and whimsical atmosphere.   We got the Bonjour crepe, the Love Hate Thing crepe, and the Apple Tree French Toast. All the food was SO good!!!!! 5/5!! The presentation wasn't as pretty as I expected but the flavors were bomb!   The only criticism I have is that the avocado in the Love Hate Thing crepe tasted off. I think it had been baked with the crepe. I would have preferred fresh avocado that had not been baked.",

The style was like that of an old fashioned diner feel including the front counter when you first walk in where you can see them cook your food.  I went in on a Monday which means we were one of very few in the restaurant, but I could imagine it does get busy.  The food was excellent we tried crepes, french toast, eggs, and bacon. Although for the price you do not get very much food, and I could've eaten more. Aside from that I would recommend this cafe for everyone to try at least once! I for one would go back to try more of their sweet crepes.",

Once seated the waitress came right over and took drink orders. The place is nice looking olden style diner look. I looked at the menu and too my surprise I did not see any hash browns or home fries on menu???? I ordered 2 eggs over easy and bacon and toast. Then I asked the waitress for home fries or hash browns or even french fries, She said they did not have any potatoes??? What sort of breakfast place does not have some sort of potato dish???? I was deeply disturbed  as I was looking forward to some home fries. In any case both eggs where over cooked one more than the other . The bacon was ok. The waitress was a bit slow as it was very busy and it took time to get all the food. Then it took even longer to get the check. I personally would not go back as for me the home fries where to breaking point. The service was a bit slow due to the volume of people. The rest of my family ordered other items on the menu and seemed to be happy.",

They told us we would wait about 45 mins and it was close to spot on.  They don't serve any alcohol, but they allow you to bring it in for a nominal corking fee. We were waiting outside with our sweaty bottles of champagne (it was so hot!!) and one of the servers came out and offered us waters and to refrigerate our champagne. How nice!  Once we sat, our server was extremely accommodating,  getting us cups of ice (some of my friends chose to bring bloody mary's instead of mimosas), spoons, and extra cups. Service was actually fairly quick for us being a larger group too.  I love breakfast, but I normally don't eat out for it because, in my head, I feel like it's so easy to make at home. Now crepes...that's a different story. This place was so good!! Everyone loved their food. It took me the whole 45 min wait to decide what I wanted to eat because everything sounded amazing. I ended up with the Bonjour, which has eggs and brie in a crepe with bacon on top and maple syrup and fruit on the side. So delicious!! They have options of sweet crepes, savoury crepes, waffles, and you can get eggs and bacon with anything. I will definitely come back here so I can try something else!",

It's so beautiful and quaint inside. I really like all the Pinocchio themed decor. The books hanging from the ceiling was also really fun and added even more visual appeal.   The food is 3/5 stars for me. The food is average. Nothing extraordinary to report back. However, I would definitely come back to try one of their waffles. I ordered the universe favorite and it tasted like what I could make at home.   This is definitely one of the cutest cafes I've been to in the city.

They have a wonderful selection of crepes and panini is as well as salads. They have lots of coffee options and even have ice cream and cones. I ordered the chicken and gruyere cheese crepe with caramelized onions and a spicy sauce. It was so delicious! My only complaint was that the crepe could've been a bit crispier. The caramelized onions made it seem more soggy in texture since it wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. It was still very delicious and I ate all of it. The side salad was crisp and fresh and the dressing was perfect. The portions were great! My husband had a turkey and avocado panini with goat cheese and also left behind a very clean plate. We both had lattes and they came in very cute cups with mini whisks to stir. I felt like I was on vacation in a foreign cafe. Loved the atmosphere and the food. Finished off brunch with an affogato. It could have used more ice cream but it was still delicious.  I can't wait to come back and try something new. They also have an assortment of sweet crepes and waffles I'll have to try next time!",

    "text": "This cafe was a random Yelp selection for a New Year's Eve morning breakfast with a friend. We easily found street parking and walked into the restaurant mid morning when we were told that we would have a brief wait. As it was rainy and cold, we avoided standing outside, but unfortunately, the inside waiting area wasn't much better. There was a small bench for two to sit which was already occupied. The front part of the restaurant was made awkward and crowded by the fact that a table with two diners was situated up front by the window. My friend stood by the table for a while but then scooted back over to stand in front of the entrance as she felt awkward encroaching on their space as they ate.  We were seated within 10 minutes at a tiny table for two. I was surprised to see half of the restaurant open when we were taken back to our seats, but I guess some of the table needed to be bused. I had noticed some of the Pinocchio decor by the entrance but spotted little children's umbrellas and books hanging from the ceiling with twine after being seated. The books seemed like a unique and fun addition to the decor while the umbrellas seemed a little weird, tacky, and juvenile to me.  We were forgotten for probably 15 minutes until an apologetic waiter made his way over to our table. I selected the Raspberry and Goat Cheese Challah French Toast with a side of eggs. The french toast was delicious, and I loved the sweet yet slightly sour and tangy combo of a tart raspberry compote combined with flavorful goat cheese. It's definitely a decadent combination that I would love to have again.  While I enjoyed the food, the tight space of the restaurant had me feeling claustrophobic by the end of my meal. Normally, I wouldn't have been bothered by the small space, but considering our crowded wait by the front door, being asked to move my chair up a couple times by another diner weaving her baby stroller out of the restaurant, and being surrounded by the arrival of a large shipment as employees scurried around our table with large boxes, I just started feeling like I was out of the way or forgotten about for my entire meal.",

I also had a sip of their lavender tea and it was divine. This time around, I ordered a crepe with nutella and strawberries.

    "text": "Best French Toast in Pittsburgh, quite possibly best in the entire United States! This cute little restaurant is quietly tucked along the strip of shops on Butler Street, but don't let it's quiet vintage look fool you, their food has some loud and modern flavors. I ordered the Smores Stuffed French Toast and it was incredible. The nutella was perfectly melted that it combined with the melted marshmallow creating a perfect balance of flavor. The gram crackers sprinkled on top add a great crunchy texture with the soft and melty toast. All the items on the menu sounded delicious, it was very difficult to choose one. And each item was very reasonably priced for the quality and size of food you get.   The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is adorable and feels very home-y. There's local art for sale on the walls, puppets to go with the theme, and vintage decorations all around. The restaurant is very small, so I recommend coming early or after the brunch rush on the weekends. Our wait was only 20mins for the 2 of us, but I can imagine the wait was longer for larger groups. I will definitely be coming back here to try more of their french toast and crepe options.",

    "text": "My mother in law found this place and Yelp and the pics were so cute we got sucked into the hype and I'm so glad we did. Firstly, the decor is absolutely adorable. The way they used the books on the ceiling is unique and creative. Secondly, beyond the aesthetics, you can get a good cup of coffee here (I am so tired of trying new placed just to get some watered down latte).  Loved my espresso con panna...loved it so much I wanted to try something else and got a pumpkin spice latte to go (can you believe that's the first ever pumpkin spice latte I've ever had in my life? #Basic) I'll be back for the coffee.   I have to be honest though, I didn't enjoy my waffle that much. I tried the raspberry and goat cheese French toast (because those flavors sound like they would be amazing together...and they were) but my actual french toast was SO dry. I don't know if the expectation was that the raspberry would moisten things more but it was like raspberry on sandpaper. My mother in law, however ABSOLUTELY enjoyed her \"the universal favorite\" french toast. She said it was definitely moist and she would recommend. Ah well, maybe mine was off??  Some of the tables are quite  close together and I think with winter coats it seems like even less space is available for a human body. The service at this place was quick and with a smile (nothing not to love about that)",

I had the \"Bella\" crepe, which was filled with portabella mushrooms, and I very much enjoyed it.

Very eclectic decorations--hanging books above the tables, exposed walls painted white, and other items with  an industrial feel to it.  The restaurant is thin up front and opens in the back a bit.  Our waiter said the weekends are really packed, so plan accordingly.  Their menu is perfect if you like a nice variety.  There are savory and sweet crepes as well as paninis.  While we did not try it, they also have a wide variety of coffee drinks and gelato for dessert.  We tried two different savory crepes, the Ham & Cheese and the Love Hate Thing.  The Ham and cheese, well it had both on it, served with gruyere cheese and a honey aioli.  We added spinach (and they have tons of other choices you an add to any dish or create your own crepe from scratch).  The Love and Hate Thing crepe was smoked turkey, goat cheese and avocado with a Bechamel sauce (Bechamel sauce, also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux and milk.)  Of the two dishes, I have to say that I liked the Ham & Cheese better because of the combination of flavors.  We went the Sunday after Thanksgiving so I might just have been tired for turkey, but I think the goat cheese was a bit overwhelming.    All the savory crepes are served with a side salad which was also yummy.  All table are provided a free bottle of water, other drinks including the aforementioned coffee cost money.  I can't wait to get back to the Burgh to visit this place again.  There are a ton of other crepes to try and maybe a few paninis too.",

Our service was friendly, prompt, and accommodating.   We ordered the French toast with blackberries and goat cheese (me), S'mores French toast (oldest), and the Geppetto crepe (youngest). Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal, and we all shared! The presentation was excellent! I could tell it was done with care.   There are a few things that were minor child-based inconveniences that I do not feel took away from the overall quality & service. A kids menu and kid-sized portions do not seem to be available (I did not ask, and none were offered). The chairs did not seem to be able to accommodate a booster seat, nor did one seem available (I did not ask). The drinks (both kids got OJ) come in medium-sized glassware. No cups w/lids seemed to be available (again, I did not ask). A little extra parenting awareness was all that was required to handle these things. However, I feel that inclusion of these features (primarily kids menu and cups/lids) would take Geppetto from a great place for parents/kids to an AMAZING place for parents and kids.   All-in-all, this was a superb breakfast experience for me and my minis. We'll definitely be back!!",

You are able to customize them if you don't see a particular topping combo you want on the menu. They also serve la prima coffee which i love! The staff is so nice and friendly. Quick service. Definitely worth checking out.",

It's the perfect brunch spot for a rainy fall morning. I ordered the prosciutto crepe, which had gruyere and honey inside it as well. It was the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and the crepe itself was amazing, too! The crepes are light, fluffy, but not greasy. Their coffee is decent as well, and you get nice large cups! I highly recommend checking this place out.",

    "text": "Great brunch place and addition to the Lawrenceville area. I was having my car detail done on an early Saturday morning and stumbled upon this place while walking to the local area library to wait it out. Glad I stopped in. This place has really great breakfast and brunch food, whether it be the waffles, crepes, paninis or coffee. I ended up getting the Universes Favorite Challah French Toast and I have to say, I really loved it. Fresh fruit, great taste, reasonable price. They also give you the option of making your own if you want as well! Savory crepes that are of note include the Love Hate Thing and the Chicken & Gruyere Cheese with that lovely kick from the spicy sauce that they use on it (I only know from the recent Yelp Elite event). Sweet things of note include the Cheesecake Waffle and Nutella Classic. Their drinks here are also decent as well (I'm looking at you, coffee lovers). There's a decent amount of seating and the ambiance within is really warm and welcoming with tables of different sizes to accommodate different party needs (small/intimate to mid-size groups, maybe one large table in the back). It is worth paying a visit here ... you will not be disappointed!",

The French Toast was soft on the outside, barely toasted and not cooked through. The seasoning barely discernable.  My wife had the Cheesecake Waffle with Raspberr covered in blueberry syrup.

One thing I was disappointed in was the slow service. We finished our meals in half the time it took them to give us our food after ordering :/ And it took a while for our waiter to come back to take our order after he said he would come back.

However, we were seated in the corner near the bathrooms with sub-par lighting.   My friend got the Nutella Classic crepe. She claimed it was way too much chocolate to the point where her crepe was simply drowned in chocolate. She also felt that the crepe was a bit too thick. I got the Universes Favorite challah french toast with strawberries and marscarpone. I enjoyed my french toast as the marscarpone cut through the sweetness. It also paired nicely with my Nutella hot chocolate.   This place was comparable to Cafe Moulin in Shadyside. For crepes, I would visit Cafe Moulin but for french toasts and other breakfast-like options, Geppetto is the place.",

We tried the ham and cheese crepe and the veggie and cheese one, both with an added fried egg. If you want a runny yolk, though, let them know! They will default give you one with a firm yolk. The ambiance is nice for a casual date or friendly chat! Umbrellas from the ceiling are a cute touch but might work better in solid colors.",

    "text": "Crepes are one of my favorite breakfast/brunch items and I feel like there aren't enough places serving up crepes in Pittsburgh. I'm happy to see more are opening up, like this one! Geppetto Cafe is in the heart of Lawrenceville alongside all the other hip eateries. The environment is modern yet spunky.   My husband and I each got crepes (of course).  We decided to both choose from the savory variety; he got Ham and Cheese (Gruyere) while I got Prosciutto (with mozzarella). Both had a honey aioli, making them quite similar. Obviously the meats and cheeses were different but the flavor profile was the same, only the prosciutto was a bit more salty than the ham. I would say the honey aioli definitely took these crepes to another level. It added a sweetness that balanced the saltiness of meat and cheese while also adding a bit of moisture to cut the dryness of the crepe. The savory crepes came with a salad, which was a nice, fresh element.   The food, service, and decor were great. My only complaint (and it may be a bit nit picky) is the really strong smell of smoke or burnt food as soon as you step in. The grill is right at the entrance and while it is nice to see the folks prepare the food, the strong smell of smoke not only left me smelling like that the rest of the day, but it really irritated my asthma while I was there. Otherwise, I would definitely come back to try a sweet crepe and hope for a table outside!",

When trying to decide between a savory or sweet crepe I went with the bonjour savory crepe because it said \"all savory crepes are served with a side salad\". After waiting 40 minutes for our food to arrive we realized we had never received a side salad as the menu stated so I asked my waiter. He explained to me that the particular crepe I ordered comes with a side of fruit so they don't give you a side salad and apologized that their menu was confusing. I was a little irritated that I just waited 40 minutes for a crepe and you couldn't offer someone a side salad that your menu clearly states they get. On top of that they opened the back door right behind our table on a day it was 30 degrees so we had to rush to finish and pay our bill so we could leave because it was so cold.   I went here really thinking I would be coming back multiple times to try all of the different menu items I was interested in but I have to say after that experience I don't think I'll be returning.",

My boyfriend had the Monte cristo and also thought that it was just missing something. I am thinking that this place may specialize more on the sweet items, and that's fine. Now I know to stick with the sweet breakfast items when I return again. The ambiance is really sweet here- books hanging from the ceilings, little Pinocchio characters hidden in the walls.

My daughter and I waited a long time for our food, and watched people who came in after us get their food and leave before our food showed up. We sat right across from the servers pickup counter and our food still did not arrive hot. The Nutella crepe was underdone and cloyingly sweet. The French toast wasn't great either. I won't be going back.",

We love the Italian job as a savory brunch or a raspberry goat cheese for a sweet option. The open concept feel to the restaurant is cool as food is made fresh right in front of us. The decor is creative and we keep on noticing new cool stuff on walls every time we stop by. The Pinocchio's in the walls are a nice touch. The owner Evren does a magical job remembering his regulars and makes sure all of his guests are enjoying their meals.",

Me and my friend chose \"sweet crepes\" which was the Cookie Monster and Ice Ice Baby. My crepe consisted of Biscoff cookie butter which is my kryptonite!! The fruit that came on each of our crepes were fresh and so sweet! The food was delicious! This place is now on my go-to brunch spots. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. Good selection of music. You walk in and can pick your own seat. Overall, I absolutely loved this cafe. First time here and it won't be my last!",

The staff working that day were friendly and helpful.  I ended up getting the Prosciutto crepe.  Fresh mozzarella, prosciutto and honey aioli?  Amazing.  It tasted so fresh, and the meat was obviously good quality.  It was savory and sweet and delicious.  Also,  it was so filling.  The iced tea I got with it was alright, the price was right, and my friend loved her meal too.  Awesome spot!",

The menu had a lot of great items- especially breakfast/ brunch. I had an iced chai tea latte and it was fantastic. The inside atmosphere is fun and whimsical and there's a lot of interesting visual appeal to the interior. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",

The \"fresh\" orange  juice was a small bottle of Tropicana places on the table, so my husband returned it. I looked around at the sweet crepes and saw those fresh whipped cream squirts. They looked like the fluff of fake rediwhip. I wasn't impressed.",

The staff is ALWAYS nice and the crepes are always delicious. I recommend the Gone Fishin' crepe. I usually get mine without the cream cheese but instead, with honey aioli. The smoked salmon, caramelized onions, capers, and the sweet honey aioli really make for an AMAZING combination.  My partner usually makes his own crepe with fruit and Nutella. I love that there is the option to build your own or to pick from their specialty crepes and waffles!",
