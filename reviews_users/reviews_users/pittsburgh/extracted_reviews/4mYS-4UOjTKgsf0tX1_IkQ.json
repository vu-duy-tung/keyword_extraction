The bread is fantastically fresh; soft with a crispy crust that you'll only get when it's right out of the oven.  They do a great classic banh mi with head cheese and pate, but the char siu is also excellent.  I usually spring for a Vietnamese coffee - the bubble tea is solid, but not as good as Fuku Tea when it comes to the texture of the tapioca pearls.  The sugar cane juice (fresh squeezed!) is mostly a novelty, as it is rather expensive for a small cup.",

Second of all, their bubble tea was amazing. I have never had bubble tea before and went for the acai berry with black tea and it was super tasty. I really enjoyed it. They had a TON of options for flavors, and they also have coffee as well as sugar cane juice and some other drink options as well. Third and most importantly, the banh mi. OMG. My coworker ordered the traditional banh mi and I went for the chicken banh mi. The bread was so fresh and so tasty, the fresh cucumber and carrot were delicious, the meat was tasty and so flavorful and the hint of cilantro topped it off. I also added sriracha and jalapenos and loved the spicy kick. Two drinks and two sandwiches and our total was about $20- what a deal! We were able to sit outside too, which was awesome on such a beautiful Spring day. I loved this place and was really impressed. I cannot wait to return!",

It's hard for me to try new sandwiches because I've become so attached to the ones I like, but the original, the Xiao Chao (BBQ pork), and the chicken one are all amazing.  The rice bowls are bomb as well-- would definitely try to go with a friend and get both. Like I mentioned in the previous review, the family that owns the place is the sweetest family ever. They always remember me and greet me by name which just makes me feel so special.   Seating is still limited, but they have a to- go option as well.",

I typically add jalapenos and Siracha, but I'd go naked for your first try.   My favorite thing on the menu, odd though this may sound, is the cafe phin--coffee brought in from New Orleans with sweetened, condensed milk.  I've come here several times just for the coffee.    The places is clean, though the indoor seating is unimpressive.  If you can, grab a seat outside for some prime Lawrenceville hipster-watching.",

I can't wait to pop in a get a bubble tea this week or even a sandwich. I've only had their sandwiches but their rice bowls look awesome!!! Don't be afraid to ask about something you don't understand or are  curious about.  I recommend getting your pork and roll spicy with fresh jalapenos and sriracha on it! It's not overwhelming and is the perfect balance of sweet and spice.",

    "text": "Growing up Vietnamese, when the other school kids packed PB&Js for lunch, I had my banh mi. I guess you can say I'm the self-proclaimed banh mi guru. Pittsburgh has a limited amount of restaurants that even offer this Vietnamese favorite, so they get automatic bonus points for bringing me back to my roots. They don't serve up your traditional Vietnamese banh mi, that's for sure, however, I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing. They added a little twist and American flare to it, and surprisingly, I didn't hate it. Sure, it can't compare to my mom's banh mi, but it was still delicious. They have several vegetarian options so I ordered the Feelin Tofu banh mi (not sure about that name though). Usually you would find pickled radishes and carrots, but they mixed it up with shredded carrots marinated in a sweet & savory brown sauce. Nothing I've ever had, but it was unique and actually complemented the tofu well. The tofu itself was very spongy. If they swapped it out for firm tofu, it would've been a winner. If you are actually looking for a more traditional version, Vietnam's Pho (now Maiku Sushi) stays True to the Vietnamese staple.   Overall, I rate them 4/5 stars. Service was fantastic - all the employees were very friendly and cheerful. The space is very cute and simplistically modern - although, they could use a few extra tables. The food was actually great despite straying from what banh mi is from a traditional sense. Definitely check this place out!",

The bread is so fresh, light and airy with the perfect crunch, this alone will keep you coming back for more. You can opt for the sandwich to be served over rice, a great alternative if you're in the mood for a big bowl of warm rice instead of baguette. The teas (organic might I add) are amazing and sweetened with cane juice they juice fresh for every order. Kelly, all of the staff, is so so very friendly. The ambience is clean and modern. Vegan options as well.  Perfect lunch spot! I love to support this small local business.",

The only downfall in coming here, is that the bread is pretty hard on the outside, probably just the type of French bread they use. My mouth gets cut up from eating the sandwiches, but honestly it doesn't stop me from coming back.  The lychee bubble tea is also my favorite bubble tea in ALL of Pittsburgh (that's saying a lot, trust me!)",

    "text": "It feels weird to be among the more critical reviews in rating 4 stars, but hopefully these comments will at least help one or two people. It's definitely cool that Pittsburgh finally has a dedicated banh mi place, and they did it in a way that fits right into the neighborhood that is Lawrenceville. The ambiance is clean and modern, the item names are cute and concisely described, and there are appropriate vegan options. (This comment may be interpreted as a subtle jab at an overly gentrified feeling and price range for this type of food, which I think is a valid observation, but not something that influenced this review!)  They offer several different types of meats on their sandwiches, or rice bowls if you prefer. Some of them have some fusion elements, like white wine or maple syrup, which I think is pretty creative. The Viet Special is made and tasted pretty much like the traditional banh mi that you would find at places at other cities where this is a staple. The baguette seemed fresh and crispy, though it was a bit plain and could have used some more butter inside. The bo kho bowl was very savory and great for warming up on a cold day. In terms of taste, I think it is superior to the one offered at Cambod-Ican in the Southside, but the portion size was much smaller despite the cheaper price.  They also have bubble tea! It's not cheap, but they have variations not found at some of the places in Oakland, like acai, lavendar, kumquat, and dates. We tried a Logan and Dates fruit tea, and it was super refreshing with date and jelly pieces.",

The sandwiches we ordered were very good (we never had banh mi before so we can't compare). They will make your sandwich spicy if you'd like too! I'd say that the bread was a little tough. I also think the sandwiches could have either used more fillings or less bread (bread to meat/toppings was less impressive). The menu list is short, but I'd argue that is part of the charm: they focus of making food quick and tasty. We waited about only 5 minutes for our sandwiches!! The staff was so friendly and the cafe space was super trendy and cute! I would definitely recommend coming for a fast, tasty lunch! I can't wait to come back and try their rice bowls!!",

Nothing was particularly flavorful or made with care.   The chicken and drunken beef bowls were okay, and the tofu banh mi was enjoyed by the vegetarian. The Vietnamese iced coffee, however, was great.   They do have a slick, clean decor and a small patio that was being dominated by a loud family when we were there. Inside they were playing country music, which was an interesting if incongruent choice.",

The pork sandwich CIA Xin and the Viet special are good, not great.   We had the taro milk tea. It was very delicious but the size was too small for the price.  We will be back.",

It's made with delicious crusty bread, really fresh tasting veggies, and sweet and savory pork.  The bubble tea here is a must too! I love the taro milk tea with green tea.  It tastes almost like a milkshake!  The restaurant itself isn't very large, but there is still a decent amount of seating.  If you're looking for a cute place to meet a friend for lunch or a casual date spot, I would highly recommend Banh Mi and Ti!!!",

    "text": "The place definitely nailed it in terms of staff friendliness and atmosphere . The place is definitely cozy and worth a try. Although there were so many great reviews about this new place, I was a bit disappointed.  I was excited to try this new place! I went there on Saturday night around 5:30 PM. To my disappointment, they had ran out of bread, sugar cane juice and we were one of the last few people who were able to score rice bowls. Although I wanted the bahn mi, I decided to give the rice bowl a chance. We ordered the drunken beef rice bowl, cha siu rice bowl, chai milk tea and green tea to go. As we got our drinks, my chai milk tea wasn't that great. I could still taste the powder with every sip that I took and there wasn't enough sugar. However, the green tea with lychee jelly was good. As for the food, I thought that the drunken beef were slices of beef as how other Vietnamese places make the bbq beef but it was more of a meatloaf consistency which I wasn't expecting and didn't really like it. The cha siu was good.   Overall, I would try it again to see what the other items in the menu are. Keep in mind that the prices for the bahn mi are a bit more expensive than bahn mi's that you can find at the strip district.",

The bahn mi here is around 8 bucks compared to the three bucks Im accustomed at various Denver or Minneapolis vietnamese spots.  The only difference is the baguette is a tad longer with greater fillings.  2). Propietors are suspected bigots.  I walk in, barely a whimper.  Just silence, as she awaits my order.  White woman enters minutes later (with chinese woman in tow interestingly) to a chorus of helloes, and helpful explanations about the menu.  I depart....woman begrudges me a thank you, as if its painful.  Just minutes prior two white men exit, to a chorus of thank yous.  They made their point, and I wont return.  3). As I waited, I witnessed two different employees, cough directly into their hands while preparing beverages.  Yuck.  Lcukily I hadnt ordered a drink.  Im a healthcare professional and hyper-aware of things like  that.",

I got their iced lavender green tea (you can choose a base of either black or green tea) with lychee jellies and it was so good I got a SECOND one! I am in Pittsburgh 5-6 times a year so I was just getting ready to hit the road home which is about a 6 hours drive and ya know, I needed quality road drinks! You could tell the tea was high quality and freshly made. Also the lavender tea had actual lavender buds/flowers in it. Can't describe how high quality this place is and also the people who work here are ridiculously friendly and so kind! I really enjoyed talking to them and can't wait to come back to Pitt to go here, enjoy their tea and say hello again! I will also have to try their banh mi next time too! Highly recommend this spot!",

If they don't identify themselves Vietnamese sandwich, I wouldn't be able to tell what region is it. My favorite out of two was the drunken beef. The beef was very well flavored and cooked. The pickled carrots and cucumber were the prefect adds on for the crunchiness.  But it tasted like Korean Bogogi. The Xia Xiu is a pork sandwich, I think it is essentially the canteens cha xu. Overall, it was good choice. I think I will go back to try more. Not sure if you can call in to order take out to save some waiting time, but at the time of writing this review, I didn't see the menu on their website. Maybe will check with them on our next attempt.",

Both were delicious, but the flavor of the pork shoulder was exquisite. Sweet, salty, and sour, the pork shoulder bahn mi was the best of the duo.   The sandwiches were jam packed with filling - generous portions of meat and pickled vegetables. The vegetables were also picked perfectly - maintained crunch with every bite.  The French bread had the perfect balance of crunch and softness.  For coffee lovers, be sure to try the Vietnamese iced coffee - strong and sweet.   Please do yourself a favor and visit Bahn Mi and Ti to satisfy your cravings for delicious food - don't waste your time at any other bahn mi place in town.",

Their baguettes always have the perfect blend of hard crunch and chew inside.  The prices are good, and the sandwiches are made very fast.    Their drinks are less spectacular.

LOADED with flavor and just so unbelievably simple and good. Their buns are amazing, great crunch. All in all this may be one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The place is super tiny with three two tops in the back, 2 chairs, and two nook tables and chairs. There's a bar that runs along the wall. I'm hoping they will put some chairs and tables outside this summer (today would have been the perfect day to sit outside). The summer rolls were also great and I loved my chai tea with red beans. The sandwiches are also huge so you get a lot for the price. Service was quick and very friendly. They were helpful and willing to answer any questions you might have about the different options. I can't wait to go back and try some of their different options.",

As far as finding foreign food in Pittsburgh, it can be really extremely tough. This food is definitely good and tastes way better than the typical foreign food in Pittsburgh.  I would definitely recommend checking it out sometime if you are in the area.",

It's a little cramped when you walk in but thankfully they have seating which extends into the back of the building as well as a few tables outside. Water is self-serve from a countertop cooler. Service is friendly and they'll readily help you if you you're having difficulty deciding what to get.  Food: I've tried all their sandwiches and can say they're all fairly tasty. I feel there is some bias to the American palate as you won't find strong flavors of pate or pickles (do chua) and the heat from the jalapenos+sriracha is relatively tame. While not the most authentic tasting, the ingredients do taste very fresh and the meats well-seasoned. The rice flour baguettes are also the real deal, airy and crispy.   Overall I like Banh Mi & Ti as they offer nice clean flavors and use quality ingredients in their sandwiches. I'd recommend this place or Ineffable Ca Phe if you have a hankering although don't expect \"down and dirty\" bold flavors like the shops in Los Angeles.",

I ordered the Xa Xiu bahn mi which is a delightfully \"crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside\" french baguette sandwich packed with char siu pork, carrots, coriander, cucumber, and fish sauce. You can request jalapenos and Sriracha in your sandwich, which I recommend as it adds a nice kick of heat to the sandwich. You can opt to add an over medium egg to the sandwich as well for an additional $1.25. Do it.   Highly recommend the black mango milk tea with boba, but I have yet to try other combinations and their fruit teas.   The interior is cozy and features a few tables inside and outside, along with bar style seating near the order counter. Wait times are very minimal so it's a great place to stop by if you're in a rush or want something to-go.",

I believe that it's pretty hard to make a bad banh mi.  We were greeted upon entering and the workers were very friendly. I ordered the Viet Special ($7.25), keeping it to the classic banh mi with pork roll, cured pork, and head cheese.  The ingredients were delicious and fresh! Their bread was just crispy enough too. If you like spicy, I recommend getting the sriracha and jalapenos in it.   My only complaint would be their Vietnamese coffee or sugar cane, it seems they really skimp out on the liquid part because your cup is majority ice for $4.50 or $4.95.  My first visit here was actually their special Bun Bo Hue Night on 5/17, which was super yummy and satisfied my craving. Hope they have another special night like that again :)!",

Up until very recently, there weren't many Pittsburgh options, so I'd have to seek out these lovely little sandwiches in other cities.   Thank goodness for Banh Mi and Ti: A brick and mortar shop selling delicious Banh Mi and tasty bubble tea.   Fist off, the staff is incredibly kind and helpful. They answered my questions and everyone seemed to be in a great mood: like they genuinely enjoyed being there. It was refreshing.  I ordered the Classy Chick and a taro milk tea with boba. The sandwich was incredible! The chicken was coated in a slightly sweet sauce. The bread was crusty and delightful and the veggies were perfectly pickled. Everything together tasted fresh and flavorful. The bubble tea was also flavorful, but not overly sweet (which I appreciate).   I can't wait to come back and try other options. Thank you for existing, Banh Mi & Ti!",

The lady behind the counter took the time to go over the menu with me. The word Banh Mi is Vietnamese for \"bread.\" I decided to choose the Banh Mi \"Bo Kho\" which is their version of beef stew. She told me I could have it with rice or a baguette. I chose the baguette.  Having heard how good the spring rolls were I decided to order that as a side. You have a choice of either shrimp, tofu or veggie summer rolls is what they call it. I went with their recommendation and ordered the tofu rolls. I was told they take a little longer because they are made fresh daily and right on the spot.   I passed on the bubble tea and ordered green tea instead. I was told that their 3 standard teas (green, black, and oolong) are all organic. I gave them my name and was told to sit down. They have a small but very nice upstairs dining area to get away from the cold.  When I got my Bo Kho I was floored that I got a baguette almost as long as a small long French bread! That thing was huge!  All that for only $8.50. The baguette was made for dipping in the sweet sauce it came in. The entree had large beef chunks along with large chunky carrots. It was literally so good I nearly made a mess of myself but had enough napkins to handle the overflow.  Now to the summer rolls. They were indeed fresh and wrapped in a thin liner. The dipping sauce that came with it I later learned was actually peanut butter drenched with hoisin sauce! It's amazing what different ways places use peanut butter. This sauce was spot on and believe me I would recommend these rolls to anyone who comes. You get two nice sized rolls for only $4.95.  I was chatting with the folks at the next table. The lady had the pork and roll on a baguette which was pork shoulder, maple syrup, and spices. She loved every bit of it.  If you aren't into sandwiches they offer rice bowls. With whatever meat you choose you get steamed jasmine rice, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and Vietnamese scallion oil. Pretty much everything is under $10.00 so you can get a good meal at a reasonable cost. Take out is also available.  As far as beverages go, in addition to regular and bubble tea, you can get Vietnamese coffee and sugar cane juice. I'm not sure if they sell bagged coffee but I noticed that some were set up that way.  So you have plenty of options to choose from. The chicken, by the way is thigh meat. While I was dining a person came around and made sure I was doing well. I was very pleased with my meal and with the service. This place is a welcome addition to Lawrenceville and next time I will try the bubble tea.",

    "text": "Just another great addition to possibly the Foody-est neighborhood in the Burgh! Banh Mi & Ti absolutely delivered a solid Vietnamese sandwich.     I've been meaning to try this place out ever since it opened a couple years ago, and I was not disappointed in the least. I had the pork n' roll Banh mi, a Vietnamese coffee and the shrimp spring rolls, and while everything was very good, nothing really blew me away either.    First off, the sandwich. It was everything that you would expect in a good Banh Mi. Fresh veggies, a good amount of pork and a nice roll. While the flavors were all there, I found it to be a tad boring. More spice, more sweet, more salt, would go a long way with this already very good sandwich.    Next, the Shrimp spring rolls. Again, along with the Banh Mi, they are good, but very par for the course. They taste pretty much like every other good shrimp roll that I've ever had. Not a bad thing, just would like something more exciting from a hot, new Lawrenceville food stop.    Lastly, the Vietnamese coffee. It's good. For me, it was a little heavy on the condensed milk. I prefer the coffee to shine through and the sweetness to be secondary. Also, a medium cost 4.60, which is a bit over priced. The 16oz cup is full of ice, only leaving you with maybe 8oz of drink. I'm not usually one to complain about pricing, but in this instance it seemed a bit over the top. However, I find the rest of their menu is a very good value, especially the sandwiches.    Overall, it was a very nice dining experience. Service was great, very nice space and awesome outdoor seating. Food is very good, but could use some excitement to bump it up to 5 stars.",

The owners care about their place and they care about their customers. I basically want to be their best friends and hang out when they are not at work, they are that nice.  I usually come in to get a drink and a thing of spring rolls. I love that they now make the spring rolls to order, so you don't have to get them early and quickly. They are now able to be made all day long! You can choose from tofu or shrimp. I usually go with the shrimp. I love that they are fresh and just wrapped tightly. It stinks whenever you get a fresh roll and the minute you bite in them they are not really that full and they also fall apart! These are really great. I also ask (if I am taking them to go) for some sriracha to be mixed with the hoisan sauce.  I like a little kick!  The sugarcane just is weird and I love it. Is it lemonade? Is it tart? Is it sweet? Is it delicious?! It is great. I usually have to pace myself so I don't suck up this drink so fast. Really, it is hard to not drink it fast. It is just so weird and good! I love it! I have even brought some to my friends just to see their initial reaction. I love their faces. They do not know what to think of it! I like it, and I urge everyone to at least try it...once!  The last time I came in I actually ordered a bahn mi! I ordered the classy chick and added a bit of jalapeno to it. It was a lot of spice! I loved it. The added fresh jalapenos were great! I think that if I also added in the sriracha would have been too much! But the jalapenos were great!  The bread was so fresh. Yum. The chicken done to perfection! Yum. The veggies were crunchy and fresh. Yum. I love it! I am excited to try the other flavors of the bahn mi! YUM.   Go here and go wild with the menu. Try new things. Get to know the staff, aka my possible new best friends. Enjoy this new place. They are really great.   My usual lineup: Classy Chick: Chopped chicken with lemongrass and garlic  Fresh Spring Rolls: Shrimp  Drink: Sugarcane juice",

They offer a short menu of Vietnamese Sandwiches, Spring Rolls, Rice Bowls and various drinks like Boba tea, Viet Coffee and even the real deal Fresh Sugarcane!  I had the pleasure of eating a couple banh mi sandwiches last week, namely the special cold cut and the char siu (xa xiu) versions.  The bread, right off the bat is fresh and perfectly made for its intended purpose.  The meats are high quality and what I would expect from an authentic Viet restaurant.  I sampled their beef stew and sugarcane drink as well - yummy stuff!  Service was top notch and interior decor inviting and warm.  What I discovered after a long foodie discussion with the owners is that everything's thoughtfully sourced from key areas and tested extensively to get it right.  I am impressed to say the least.  As expected, they are working through all the kinks to smooth out all the operational boo-boos their first few weeks.  There is no doubt in my mind Banh Mi and Ti will be around for a long time and I wish them the best.  See you there!",

It's about time we got a brick and mortar specializing in the (oh-so special and dear to me) Vietnamese sandwich. I love that they have several options too, not just one choice. Each sandwich was carefully crafted to incorporate the authentic, traditional flavors with their own special twist. We got the Viet Special and the Pork 'n Roll. Both were amazing and had a crazy array of flavors and textures in each bite. Just FYI, the Viet Special is more of a cold cut sandwich.   To make the place even more special to me, Banh Mi & Ti also has fabulous bubble tea. Their bubble tea is a step above all the rest because unlike most other places, their tea base is actual tea and not a powder mix. Because of this, you can choose your base: black, green, or oolong. They also don't overload on the sugar, but of course can tailor to your preferences. That's another benefit of not using a pre-made powder!  I cannot wait to come back and to tell all my friends about this cute sandwich and coffee/tea shop!",

We had to wait about 10 minutes in line, which is a little difficult in the winter as everyone crams inside. The cashier was very pleasant talking through the options with all the guests including descriptions of the sandwiches and bubble tea drinks.  The sandwiches were both fantastic (make sure to ask for extra jalepenos). Better than Lucy's? Hard to say. But still 5 star worthy in my book.",

    "text": "Loved this place.  We had a wonderful no-frills bahn mi shop in Portland, ME, that I miss terribly (you know, only cash, knew what you wanted because you were a regular--didn't even need to ask).  This place one-upped it on friendliness.  The staff was amazing and very kind with suggestions.  We got the Lemongrass Chicken and Maple pulled Pork sandwiches (names have escaped me).  They were topped with pickled veggies and fresh cilantro, and I would have happily had those doubled.  The pork was a little tough to chew, but my MIL and husband enjoyed the Chix. We also got boba tea, I had mango and husband had strawberry. The bobas were a little overcooked and stuck to each other in the bottom. A stray one may have nearly killed my husband by choking (we have life insurance policy, so no worries).  The store is located in the now-bustling Lawrenceville and opened late-morning on a weekday.  The inside is narrow, but expands to some seating in the back, up a few stairs.  We sat on stools at the counter while we awaited our order.  It was clean, more modern/contemporary decor, and menu easy to read behind the counter.  Service was amazing and I hope that stays!  I haven't tried other places in Pittsburgh, and if none compare, I'll happily return and review accordingly.   But, certainly, I recommend you stop in.  At least get a boba tea.",

I didn't order food here, but those in my party did and told me that the beef stew with baguette was delicious.  I ordered a medium pea flower based (caffeine-free) lavender tea with passion fruit popping boba.  It was incredible.  They add fresh herbs, a mint leaf, and a very thin apple slice and the tea is not sickeningly sweet like many boba teas are.    The Vietnamese ice coffee is ok but they serve it with too much ice, so ask them to go easy on the ice when ordering it.   The cafe itself is small but very clean. In good weather you can sit out in front of the cafe under an umbrella. The staff are helpful and friendly.  I love that it's a women-owned restaurant.",

We got the Special w/ head cheese and the drunken beef. The drunken beef was the flavorful star of the show!  I kept stealing bites of it because it was so good and gingery.   We also got an oolong milk boba tea. It was tasty, but could have had more bubbles and less ice!   The ambience felt a little weird. I didn't like that you could see right into the trash, and the trash and recycling bring so visible made it feel kind of messy and gross.   When my partner and I sat in the seating area that is a little upstairs, there were fruit flies bothering us!  There was also some child that the owners were watching that kept shouting about poo and using the bathroom?  Kinda turned me off to have that happening next to me trying to eat their tasty Banh mi.",

If you're not up for a full meal, they have a selection of spring rolls (I believe there is a vegetarian and non-vegetarian option) as well as an assortment of drinks. Lots of flavors of bubble tea (including interesting, less common ones such as ginger or herbal) as well as toppings that go beyond the typical boba.   Seating inside is limited (a few small tables) although there are a few tables outside for the warmer months. Depending on how busy of a time it is, it's not unlikely that you'll have to take your food somewhere else.",

The bread of the Banh Mi was so delicious, crunchy exterior, soft interior. The ratio of meat to bread was perfect and the added veggies have a nice crunch and flavor! I'm not a huge cilantro fan but honestly with the flavors of the Banh Mi, it was delicious. The bubble tea was the perfect sweetness and I got mine without milk, but the flavor was really good and they give you a lot of jelly, which made me happy!!  All in all, I think their food is really solid and so is their welcoming customer service. All of my food came out super fast, everyone was so nice. The environment was really warm and the interior of this place is small but cute! I will definitely be coming here again!!",

It's a concoction of beef and carrots swimming in a rich broth made of Chinese five spice, lemongrass, tomato, and more. The beef was cooked to tender perfection and easily pulls apart. It's usually a spicy dish, but if spice is not your thing then you can get it without or on the side.   Everything was delicious and I would come back!",

I've really only tried the Viet special so I can't speak on their other items but it's one of the more authentic ones in Pittsburgh. The Vietnamese iced coffee is also a perfect complement to the sandwich.  Special vietnamese sandwich: 9/10 Viet coffee: 9/10",

The line for take-out was long, most tables were filled (indoor seating is pretty limited), and the phone was ringing every minute with new orders. Despite all that, I found a seat and they had my order to me in less than 5 minutes. It only cost me $16 and I ordered a large flavored tea, shrimp spring rolls, and a drunken beef banh mi. It was all delicious. The drunken beef banh mi was the best I've ever had.  The people working were sooooo friendly and the service was quick and efficient. I will be back to try a different banh mi.",

First of all, their baguettes are hard and crunchy on the outside, which is amazing. The Viet Special in particular has some very flavorful and mouthwatering ingredients like the pate and head cheese which go so well together.  In terms of drinks, I've tried the Viet iced coffee and a pretty basic bubble tea. Their iced coffee is pretty good, but if you're ordering it definitely be aware that most of the cup is filled with ice. I usually just drink the free water they have in the store when I go.",

I say luckily because the sky just opened up and a big thunder storm started as we ran in.       We have had Banh Mi before and have made it at home.  Carrie saw good reviews on this place so we had high expectations and they were met!       We looked over the menu at the counter and ordered.  We both ordered Pork Bahn Mi's and a side order of Shrimp Summer Spring Rolls to share.       We went to sit down and our food came to us within 5 minutes.  Just perfect since we were so hungry.  Our sandwiches were excellent.  The summer rolls were delicious too.  If you have never had a Banh Mi before it's hard to explain.  It's just a lot of great flavors exploding in your mouth.  Cilantro, pickled vegetables, Jalapeno's and so much more.  One sandwich each and summer rolls were plenty and we were full after.       You might say it tasted really good because we were so hungry.  My brother and his wife came along with us.  They aren't foodie people and don't eat different food that much.  They still came because we highly recommended trying a sandwich.  They didn't know what to order but they ordered the Summer rolls and a Banh Mi.  They loved it too.  They were pleasantly surprised and I think they are Banh Mi fans now!  We will be back to this great little Bahn Mi shop!",

The Viet Special may be my favorite, but I like ordering something different every time I go in since there are enough options to keep things interesting. My only minor complaint would be price, however I do happily pay it given the quality and experience.  The proprietors are lovely people who care about their food and their business. By the third time I came in Kelly had already learned my name and now greets me when I walk in. It felt like a neighborhood joint the first week it opened and now regularly gathers a big line during the weekend. It is worth the wait.",

Decor is clean and airy, great place for a solo lunch or a date (prices are very reasonable for the service and how much you get.) My only complaint is I live a few blocks away and would really like to not spend all my money here in the future. Definitely one of my new favorites in the neighborhood!",

We have been here twice and both times we had a seriously delicious sandwich and a comparably delicious shrimp summer roll.    Both times I had the pork belly bahn mi or xa xiu banh mi, which is absolutely delectable.  The bread is nice and sturdy but not too hard, while the perfectly seasoned pork belly and crunchy, acidic pickled vegetables play nicely with the fattiness of the pork.  The fresh cilantro on top just really ties this sandwich together.  All I can really say is I am sad I am not eating one right now.",

The bubbles are a bit of a hit or miss - sometimes they're perfect and other times they are old and soft.  The bahn mi, on the other hand, are great. There's lots of different options of what you can put into the bahn mi, and if you're not sure then go for all of them! Great place to hang out for a bit with friends for a casual lunch or even brunch!",

    "text": "They say there is no lunch that is free, And this one will cost seven fifty, But it's worth every penny, Cuz like Forrest loved Jenny, You'll love every bite of Banh Mi.  The drinks here are damn good as well, Made with skill and with love, I can tell, In each sip you will revel, And if Barbie's the devil, Then I always want to be in hell.  Pittsburgh has some fantastic meals, But no surprise when Fox E reveals, This is Pitt's best Viet sandwich, And I'm Barbie's fave man which, Means I get to take off her heels.  I know most men are jealous of me, Because I'm semi-dating Barbie, She said, take my V-Card, Then go hit the gym hard, And then take me to Banh Mi & Ti.  What to get: Banh Mi & Drinks. What about the Ti?!: Those are the drinks, genius.  This place keeps giving me warnings and more warnings and \"final warnings\" for all of my public lewdness and obnoxiousness on their property. They also keep getting tea spillages, and are trying to figure out how to stop all future tea spillages. I don't understand why they don't just Ban Me & Tea from their establishment.  Some of the nicest people I've ever been served by in Pittsburgh, and easily the best Boba drinks and Vietnamese sandwiches in town - by a distance. Gorgeous little cafe and everyone should put it on their Pitt to-try list.  Some Vietnamese sandwiches use Bad Meat & Tea but this place does not. It's perfect.  BM&T is the kind of place that Pittsburgh has been crying out for for a very long time. I enjoyed the Boba drinks for sure - up there with the best I've had in Pitt, although not as good as others elsewhere - but the Banh Mi sandwich was exceptional and easily my favourite in Pittsburgh, and in PA. It was absolutely delicious. I could eat 20 more of them probably. In fact I think I'm going to go back there right now and do exactly that.  People are always like \"let's listen to USA For Africa and drink coffee.\" I'm like, no f***ing way. I prefer Band Aid & Tea.  I had the milk tea, which was good, and Barbie had the pea flower drink (the pretty one with purple and yellow, for Instagram), and she adores pea flower drinks and loved it. I thought hers tasted yummylicious too.  It also helps that this place is run by some of the nicest people in the world. I will be back here every single time I'm in Pittsburgh. The reviewers that gave this place top marks were absolutely right. A special mention to Ahmad A, now in Chicago, who insisted I come here. He was damn right, too.  This place is Vietnamese Paradise in Pittsburgh. It's absolutely wonderful and probably the best Vietnamese place we've been to in Pittsburgh. 90 and all of Pennsylvania. The service is wonderful as is be excellent the core and the spectacular sandwiches and drinks are on another level. We will definitely be back here every time we come to Pittsburgh. I can't say that it's the best bubble tea in the city but is definitely right up there. Find me Whispering her Pittsburgh colors as usual and representing in a wonderful way. I couldn't really have enjoyed this experience anymore and we hung out here for a very long time  David Duchovny had an affair with me while he was married to Leoni. I told him, you don't have to choose between us bro. You can just Bang Me & Tea.  But yeah. Come here. ASAP.",

    "text": "Wow, 1,700, Wow.  This is review 1,700.  I'm always up to trying something new.  I am not one to shy away from anything (that is if it's within what I am allowed to eat).  When my better half suggested we stop here for a bite to eat, I was down for that.  I have never had Vietnamese food before in my life.  I have heard many people talking about how satisfying it is and was actually a little excited to give it a try.  Not sure how we did this but we showed up at just the right time.  There were people inside already, but when we entered we had no wait at all.  We walked up to the counter and started to look over the menu.  Within minutes we placed our order and found ourselves a seat.  Looking around you find that they went with a simple design.  It feels crisp and clean in here and very welcoming.  The section in the back has a few tables that you can choose to sit at or use the wall bar area to enjoy your meal.  They have t-shirts for sale in here as well for promotion of the place.  Do not know the pricing on them, but they come in white, black and grey.  After looking around for a bit my sandwich and drink arrived, looking quite inviting I must say.  The bread was perfect, strong enough to hold the sandwich together but not hard enough to cut your mouth when you bite into it.  The meat was delicious.  But what I loved about the sandwich, and you can call me weird because of this, was the cilantro.  I love the taste of cilantro.  It reminds me of freshness.  It reminds me of good food.  So, Banh Mi & Ti, you got me...you got me good.  You made me fall in love with your food because of some cilantro.  I will definitely be back to indulge again.  But wait, there's more.  My tea, my god was it good.  I have just recently reintroduced tea to my system so anytime I go anyplace I try the tea.  I opted for the green tea with strawberry.  It seems an odd combination, but it worked.  Those little bubbles bursting with flavor making it that much more enjoyable.    Such a great place and a great introduction to Vietnamese food for me.",

I also ordered an oolong boba tea and my friend ordered the mocha boba tea. The oolong was good but the matcha was amazing!

Situated in the heart of Lawrenceville, the Vietnamese eatery is a local favorite that evokes simplicity and sweetness. It has outdoor seating and a cute interior with a wall that customers can draw on. The banh mi is deliciously addicting... They offer a few options including vegetarian. The Pork n Roll is my usual - pork shoulder, maple syrup, five spices. I always end up with an Iced Vietnamese Coffee, easily finished quickly because it's so good. Perfectly sweet.

The cold cuts, especially the Viet pate, are simply \"correct\" in a way that I almost never find in US banh mi. Really outstanding flavor there. And the bread is pretty good.  Vegetables, though, are a tiny bit lacking---not quite pickled enough, and the jalapenos are too weak to meaningfully add spice. Compared to my gold standard of Khai Tri in Paris, that takes these down a notch.",

Unlike many bahn mi sandwiches in town, these sandwiches have a good portion of meat inside and are really filling.  The spring rolls are huge and fresh--big pieces of shrimp with herbs and noodles, I would put these up as some of the best in town.    They sometimes have housemade non-alcoholic drinks, like strawberry limeaid.  That's what they  had when I was there last, and it was wonderful.    The patio is nice and sunny, a great place to sit and enjoy a sandwich and iced tea.  Everyone that works here is also very nice and helpful.    A+",

    "text": "This is a solid banh mi. I've had the drunken beef, pork belly, chicken, and kho bo. The bread is excellent, though much denser than traditional banh mi if that's what you're accustomed to. The beef options are my favorites, with the drunken beef boasting a tangy flavor from white wine. The kho bo is rich and warming, and comes as a large bowl of beef and carrot stew with a plain baguette. I really appreciated that the staff accommodated my request for a side of the veggies (cilantro, cucumber, carrot) that go on the other sandwiches. While they don't normally go with kho bo, I liked having them to make my own little sandwiches. The bubble teas are very good with ample bubbles, and the staff is very friendly when taking often long phone orders for my coworkers and I.   I have to say that I'm not totally wild about their pickled carrots. Everywhere else I've had banh mi, the carrots are julienned so that they maintain some crunch. Often they are mixed with daikon which adds even more taste and textural variety. However, here the carrots are shredded very finely, and they lose much of their appealing crunch. Not a deal breaker but they could really improve the whole sandwich. Also, on several sandwiches I've had tastes of fish sauce that were unexpected. The menu states that it comes on the pork belly, which is fine, but there was an overwhelming amount that drowned out the other flavors. On other sandwiches that don't claim to be topped with fish sauce, I've tasted it on random bites, almost like it was on a utensil and got transferred. Again, I'm fine with fish sauce and understand that it's a vital Vietnamese ingredient, but if it's going to be used uncooked in its most pungent form, I'd like to know in advance.",

The Xa Xiu sandwich is one of my favorite.  The pork in it is great and cooked well.  The bo kho bowl  was very filling and portion great.  My favorite so far is the bo kho sandwich.  It comes with the stew and a naked sandwich.  The stew tastes great and is well done.  Paired with the sandwich, I feel like I am eating a meal my grandma made me.  Their flavored tea has been great as well.  Except the boba has been inconsistent.  First time I had it, boba was well cooked but bland.  Second and third time I had it it taste great but wasn't cooked well.  Still a work in progress.  Their summer roll is basically just their version with spring roll.  Their sauce taste great and it was also well made.  Customer service is also still exceptional.  Recommendations, if you're looking to try a sandwich, The Viet Special is still the one to try.  It's the cheese steak of the Vietnamese people. Majority of Vietnamese banh mi shops will have this sandwich.  If you want something with more familiar ingredients, try the Xa Xiu.  And if you want something comforting on a cold, rainy day, the bo kho sandwich/bowl is the way to go.  Add jalapeno to everything.  It's cut very thinly so it adds a nice subtle heat to your meal but doesn't burn.  If you want legitimate Vietnamese coffee, this place got it.  Overall, this place is fantastic and a must try.",

Viet iced coffee was good, though a bit sweet and far too much ice to warrant the cost. The plastic cup is completely full of ice before liquid is added.  Seating was a bit sparse, though I don't dock eateries for this. It adds to the charm.

I asked if I could just get less ice but that was also $1 extra. Unbelievable!! The cups are already pretty small to begin with. We watched them make the sugar cane juices and saw in dismay as they filled up the cups COMPLETELY with ice before adding the juice. They also only put the sugar cane through the grinder once. I asked why and was told that if you put the sugar cane multiple times through the grinder, the pulp will come out too. However I've seen multiple other establishments do this and get so much more juice. My recommendation is for this place to either get a better machine or use a filter after grinding the sugar cane. $5 for HALF a cup of sugar can juice is RIDICULOUS. Please refer to my photos for evidence on the cup of juice and then how much was left when I took out all the ice. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because my friends got the Bahn Mi which I tasted and it was pretty good. 0/10 would not recommend this place for the sugar cane juice. In fact, would not recommend this place for the Vietnamese coffee either. My friend bought it last time and same issue happened with her. So disappointed in this place.

We ordered the Drunken Beef Rice Bowl and traditional Banh Mi sandwich, both of which were very delicious and honestly some of the best tasting Vietnamese food I've eaten in the states. For drinks we ordered the Vietnamese style iced coffee with condensed milk and even came back post-meal to try one of their strawberry green teas (Both drinks were incredible). You can really tell everyone working here was happy to assist and the patio area was great for a relaxing meal outside. Can't wait to come back again soon.",

Like many of the reviewers have already mentioned, if you live or have lived here in Pittsburgh.. you know this was EXACTLY what we are missing in our city.   My mom and I came in on a Tuesday afternoon to order for a take-out not long after they opened and almost all of the seats were already taken - that's how yummy this place is! We had drunken beef and xa xiu banh mi & banh mi bo kho to go - all so delicious and perfectly seasoned to our tastes. My mom can be a picky eater when it comes to any Asian cuisine but if she says it's good, you just have to believe her. We also had ca phe sua da, which is so satisfying and goes great with banh mi. But next time I already know I gotta try their nuoc mia (sugarcane drink).  Overall this place has surpassed my expectations! I'm so excited to know that the next time I crave banh mi.. there's a spot 20 mins away from me!",

Even when they are super busy, you never feel like you're being hurried a long. You order at the counter and you can eat in or take it to go.     The customer service is outstanding. I called to order food, thinking that they closed an hour later than they did, so it ended up being about 15 minutes before they closed. Rather than be rude and telling me that they closed in 15 minutes ( which most places would do), I was pleasantly surprised that I was encouraged to order Togo and that they were happy to take my order!  They called me back to clarify a missing part of my order and also put the thought into putting our sauces on the side, without us even asking. Our whole conversation, she was just so nice and even told me to tell the person picking my order up to drive safe. That to me, goes above and beyond.    The food is consistent, simple, and fresh. They make everything to order.  It literally is the owners and their family making the food!  The bubble tea is the best that I've had in Pittsburgh. The tea is organic, the boba is the perfect consistency every time, and they even make their own aloe chunks for their drinks!    I never really traveled to this side of town, but I make the trip weekly now just to come here.  The inside is simple and trendy. Such a gem and I'm so glad that we finally have a spot like this in Pittsburgh!  I always leave with a smile, whether I eat in or take out!",

Just a heads up, if you want the sugarcane juice, come first thing in the morning. They use fresh sugarcane and juice it right in front of you. Otherwise, the Banh mi definitely hit the spot and am glad to be back here again.",

One of the staff is brother to one owner and sister of the other. Parents do the cooking in the kitchen. Everything on the menu is a family recipe. These are some of the nicest people I've ever met in my life. The friendliest small business owners I think I've ever encountered. Genuinely happy, kind, friendly and eager to explain everything on the menu. The fact that they call us by name is wonderful. It's the atmosphere you want in a local establishment. It was so refreshing to be greeted in such a fashion and to have wonderful conversation with the proud business owners. And proud they should be. The sandwiches we had were nothing short of perfection. I had the Drunken Beef sandwich; ground beef soaked in white wine for two hours and marinated in sweet onion and other spices. Topped with homemade mayo (I ordered without as I don't eat mayo) cilantro, carrots, cucumbers and jalapenos. My boyfriend had The Viet Special special with cured pork, head cheese and the same veggies. Both came on delicious hard rolls. A great styling of Vietnamese and French cuisine. We've decided we need to eat there everyday but will have to settle for once a week.  I love the layout and cozy feel of the interior. It's cozy in the sense that it feels comfortable and relaxing and though it's a smaller space it's not cramped at all. Counter seating in front and tables in back with two arm chairs at a faux fireplace. It's really quite lovely. What a fantastic addition to Lawrenceville. I haven't been this excited about a restaurant in a really long time. Everyone needs to experience the phenomenal flavors and appreciation that we did. PS: They have bubble tea!!!! Oh and Vietnamese coffees & teas too.",

If you're still reading, then it must be after business hours so I'll tell you why this place rules.  I moved here from Philly and we had a bazillion options for banh mi.  Since Pittsburgh is known for sandwiches, imagine my shock at discovering that none of the Vietnamese restaurants serve this fantastic treat!  I found this one on Facebook and discovered today was their soft opening. Score! I came in and found a lovely, clean and modern little restaurant.  They were only serving a few items, so I got 2 Viet Special sandwiches and a Tofu rice bowl. The Viet Special is a very traditional banh mi with a few types of cold cuts, pate and mayo topped with pickled carrots, cukes and cilantro all served on a baguette. They also offer you either jalepeno or sriracha for spice (I went with the latter).     OMG you guys! I am still shaking my head with pleasure. This sandwich was exactly what I've been looking for! They also serve a few varieties with seasoned pork, beef, chicken or fried tofu.  All sounded amazing, but that Viet Special has earned a place in my heart.  I spoke to the owners and these ladies moved here from the Philly area a couple of years back.  They were also saddened by the lack of banh mi, so they made their own.  Eventually friends and friends of friends wanted them and...this dope place was born!  My only qualm is that they don't offer their tofu either baked or sauteed.  I'm not a huge fan of breading and I'd be fine with it on its own.  But that is such a minimal issue.   When you see me stuffing my face in there, be sure to say hi!",

There were at least 7 people working behind the counter at the same time on Saturday afternoon. Some of them would walk back in the back room to get more ingredients. That makes the service really fast. There is some space in front of the restaurant. I hope they put out some tables and chairs soon so we could sit outside in a nice day.  We will go back and bring friends!",

I am equally excited to report that they make really authentic food and that the owners are some of the nicest people I have ever met. They went above and beyond to make sure that everything in my order was perfect.  I have so far only tried the chicken banh mi but could already tell that it was super authentic, in addition to being tasty. I grew up very close to the \"Little Vietnam\" of the greater Washington DC area and grew up eating banh mi at least once every few weeks. I think this is the real deal and very much look forward to trying the other sandwiches!  Also, don't overlook the bubble teas. They are really good here. They make them with organic teas and offer a variety of mix-ins beyond tapioca, including aloe bubbles (my favorite).",

Ambiance: Super casual and small. The staff was obnoxiously welcoming and was willing to answer all our questions - no matter how stupid they were.   Food:  Vietnamese special, Drunken Beef Rice Bowl, Iced Vietnamese coffee, and Strawberry Green tea with Aloe Vera. I literally couldn't tell you which was the best. I personally had the Rice bowl and it was super great. The rice was delicious with the meat and veggies were covered in a delicious sweet sauce. If you're ok with a little spice, be sure to add the jalapenos because they really added to the depth of the dish and complimented the sauce.   The tea was superb as well, especially since I had no idea what I was doing with the ordering. Honestly, I dont think they would let you go wrong even if you could.   Will absolutely go again. such a phenomenal addition to the neighborhood.",

I was so excited for this place to open, I miss having bahn mi close to home. The bread was very good - crunchy on the outside and soft inside - and the meat toppings were delicious! Definitely a well made, classic combo bahn mi ($7.25). I tried a bite of the chicken and it was well flavored. If you're deciding between a sandwich and a bowl, go for the bread, it's more filling.   They also have boba with various toppings and flavors, and Vietnamese coffee. I'm very excited to welcome this place to lawrenceville, I think it will be a great place for a casual meal and seems to be reasonably priced for the area.   I am going back soon to try the beef stew, one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes!",

So finding Bahn Mi & Ti was such a nice blessing. I got the Bo Kho Bowl, and my friend got the Drunken Beef Bowl because we were both feeling rice for dinner. For the price point they were at, this definitely satisfied my expectations.  My Bo Kho Bowl came with two separate items: the rice with the marinated carrot and tomato slices on top, and the soup based beef with carrots. The beef was so tender, it easily fell apart. It was well marinated, so it tasted yummy too. The soup was flavorful, but not overpowering or too salty, and it mixed really well with the rice and vegetables!  I tried my friend's drunken beef bowl, and the meat was also very tender after being marinated in white wine! The flavor is nice, and I would choose to get that as well in the future when I'm feeling for a dry dish.",

The baguette roll is slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside, the beef was tender and the picked vegetables, homemade mayo and sweet onions were the perfect accompaniment.

I used to live near a few Vietnamese sandwich shops in the Italian Market area in Philly and have always been a huge fan of Bahn Mi sandwiches. The combo of the crusty bread, meat and bitter veggies is such a delectable flavor! Throw in some bubble tea and I'm a very happy girl.  The shop is warm and inviting. Not huge inside, but we had no problem snagging a table. There is a bar along the wall with seating in the front room, a few tables in the back room and some outdoor seating as well. We were greeted immediately with smiles and an offer to explain anything on the menu if needed. They have a nice explanation of how the traditional Bahn Mi sandwich came to be, which is located on the wall opposite from the counter.  I had the Drunken Beef and my fiance had the Viet Special. We were both very satisfied with our decisions and wished that we had room to try some of their fresh spring rolls! There's always next time for that. I love that they have the option of milk teas and also black/green/oolong for the bubble tea. They have a great variety of flavors to mix and even have a few varieties of the Bursting boba that I love.   Great food, great location. I'll be back soon!",

We both love it, everything .. from the flavor to presentation of the rice bowls. Mmmm.. I want to try the sandwich too, everyone seems to love the sandwich a lot. I'm going to come here a lot, I just know. :-p I also got their boba tea. I ordered a medium mango flavor green tea with aloe Vera and lychee jelly. I love it. The only thing I would suggest improving is, either more staff or expand the seating area. When I went there for lunch, there is an event going on I guess. They're so busy and a lot of customers were waiting for their food standing. It's quite crowded. However, as soon as I got my food, it's worth the wait 100% :) highly recommend it to everyone.",
