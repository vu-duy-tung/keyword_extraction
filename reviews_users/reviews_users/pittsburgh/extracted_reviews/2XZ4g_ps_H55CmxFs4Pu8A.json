I ordered quesadilla explosion salad not too difficult.. the serverv brings out my bag folded under  so I figured my food was right ,  I'm in a rush to go I had to wait 15 minutes for it to come... I got home open up my bag and see there's no quesadillas on the salad ... I call chili's management was very rude she said cheese flaps as she called them were only worth a  1.99 and I'm not making you another salad for a 1. 99 worth of food and also I don't have access to any vouchers to send and she hung up on me and would not answer the phone again.... Stay clear of this place they do not remedy their mistakes..  I will not be going back at this location Jan 20th 2014 11 p.m. Management was rude 855 Freeport road waterworks mall... If you do go order in so that they can remedy before you pay...",

The steak came out and it was medium rare so I asked if they could cook it longer. At this restaurant two servers wait on one table so the other girl brings my steak back out and it is cooked longer but they put the spicy sauce on it. I tell the girl I can't eat it due to a food allergy and she looks irritated and takes it back. Ten seconds later the other guy comes back out with my same steak but the sauce is gone, they just wiped it off! By this time my husband was done with his meal so I said forget it, I'm not going to wait for a whole new steak at this point. The manager came out and said she would take mine off the bill (I would hope so considering I didn't eat it). We were both extremely dissatisfied. I went home and had a bowl of cereal for dinner.",

We were there as a family with 5 people and the service was very sub par. Our food did not come out together and the order was incorrect. Although the servers were friendly, the food was among the worst I have had at a Chili's. Everything was over seasoned and over cooked. At the Waterworks Mall there are several other food choices. I would recommend any of them over this Chili's.",

The manager offered to have the cook redo my veggies. Huh? So I guess I was supposed to sit at the table and pick out the raw ones along with the few that were wilted. Since I had barely touched it, I would've just preferred my whole entree cooked the right way together. After all, I go out to eat when I want the convenience of not having to cook/clean up. If I need to dissect my meal to fix it, kinda pointless to go out.   The 2 stars are only for the waitress because she wasn't the one to blame for my food and happened to be very friendly.",

My boyfriend and I were super hungry, and we wanted to spend a little time out enjoying the evening. We had a $25 GC for Chili's and thought this to be a good time to use it. (Hey, being broke really sucks!) We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by the hostess. Once we were seated, we waited quite awhile for the server to come and take our drink order. By the time he arrived, we already knew what we wanted.   He seemed rushed and impatient. That made me feel anxious and embarrassed, and I don't like that feeling when I am going to eat....or basically ever. We went with the appetizer and two entrees for $20. We chose the onion strings and jalapenos. You can't go wrong with fried onions, right? Wrong. Super wrong. They were really salty and peppery, and it was hard to finish them. In fact, we didn't even get a chance. The waiter took the leftovers without even asking if we were finished!   A long long wait went between our appetizer and our entree. We ended up ordering the 5-cheese pizzas. They eventually arrived, and they looked good. They were lukewarm though, and we were missing ranch that we had asked for multiple times.   So we waited an eternity to get ranch. This pizza desperately needed the ranch to make it palatable. Seriously. It was that bad.   The server kept taking ages to come back and pay attention to our needs. I ordered a Blue Moon, and it took super long for that to come to the table too. I needed a drink after going through what we went through for this meal! Oh, but he didn't even ask to see my I.D. Some people might think that's cool, but I am extremely bothered when I.D. checking is not strongly enforced. I could have easily been an underage girl, in fact, a lot of people think I am! I thought this was extremely irresponsible and dangerous behavior, and it's not something I would expect from ANY establishment!   Other complaints include the fact that what is vegetarian and not vegetarian on their menu is rather ambiguous. Did you know that their seasoned tomatoes are seasoned with some kind of animal-protein based seasoning? What is that about? Gross.   I really dislike leaving bad reviews, but our experience here was just so awful. I felt bad for the server because he seemed like he was having a hard time, but everything kept getting worse, and it is extremely unacceptable.   I will not return to this Chili's, nor will I go to any other Chili's in the future.",

Their service was really nice, but their food was lacking. My husband and I shared their fajitas for 2 and were given the wrong kind of protein, we asked for pork, chicken, and beef. We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up.   I will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime.   The ambiance was nice and the place was clean. But overall despite the friendly service, we were not very impressed with their food.",

The entire night our waitress was simply rude with a poor attitude. Turns out she was a \"trainer\" for another waitress, and here I was thinking she was the trainee.   Ordering a simple salad was a chore because finding out what dressing was vegan was a tall hop, skip and a jump through their staff and ziosk atop the table. They weren't understanding that I couldn't have honey and continued to suggest items containing it.   When asking how to navigate the ziosk's dietary restrictions, all I got was hostility.   Surprise, when it was time to get the check, she turned the charm on and according to our bill, the sour server was named Becky.",

What would have made this a 3 out of 5 star rating for me would have been 'just good service' but our waiter wasn't attentive at all.  It took him a good 10 minutes to come to our table to take our order.  Timeliness of our food getting to the table was adequate as the items were hot and fresh. But after he delivered appetizers, he never came back to see if we wanted condiments (we did).  So we did the 'wave and a yoo-hoo' to get his attention. When he served our lunch, he never came back to see if we wanted condiments (we did again) or refills to our drinks and we had to do our 'wave and yoohoo!' again just to get his attention.   The reason I am docking my rating down to 2 stars is because the restaurant wasn't busy! Otherwise, it would be understandable that they might be short staffed and therefore, lacking in service. But this wasn't the case.  Might not go here again for lunch because there are other food places in the same shopping plaza.",

    "text": "I went here on a whim, never having been to a Chili's before. Everything on their menu was pretty much fried and nasty. They cater to the lowest common denominator of food-shoveling American consumers. They might as well add \"bowl of ranch dressing\" as a side item.  I got tacos that tasted like they were rubbed in salt and artichoke dip that came with almost translucently greasy tortilla chips that, like the tacos, burned your mouth with saltiness.  What are you trying to do here? You know you can make money by freshly preparing food and letting the actual ingredients show through? Places like this are literally a disrespect to the human race. When you eat at a place like this, you tell restaurant boards that you enjoy having your food microwaved so it comes out fast and piping hot, that you'd rather taste massive amounts of seasonings, mainly salt, than actually taste the food, and that you'd much rather have something wrapped in grease and batter that is bite size and can be crammed in your mouth in quick succession.  Stop going to places like this and they'll actually improve their menu and put more emphasis on quality.",

However this location has been consistently horrible in the service department. I often feel like they only cater to regulars. That's nice, but on an extremely slow day to just buy gift cards for the holiday, we couldn't get waited on. There were three people sitting at the bar and three people behind the bar. Yet not one person faced us. Their backs were too us and we had to get their attention every time we asked for anything. then they would continue their private conversations. One drink and gift cards took a half hour to purchase and cash out. Unacceptable. Very poor experience.",

The food is terrible, served cold, disorganized kitchen, temperature of steaks are horrible, (apparently do NOT know how to check temps) ordered a DIET soda & brought a regular soda, no management to be found (except for at the bar the whole time to discuss my issues), people sitting around me in both directions were all complaining about similar complaints I had . The best steak available on the menu was 3/4 fat & way over cooked & after 3 times taken back to the kitchen after requesting medium rare (probably dropped on the floor couple times too & still could t get it rite!!!) (I took it home for the dog) I used to like getting Fajitas, but now the tortillas are served in foil (that's really classy & NOT restaurant quality) which don't even stay warm at all & get hard too! (used to be served in a red plastics container with a lid that kept them soft & warm) Who knows why THAT's changed too.....",

    "text": "Worst experience imaginable. Holy crap. This picture should be enough proof (it's the chicken crispers) but the awful service made it so much worse. It was tonight, a Friday at 6ish and my boyfriend and I were gonna go to a movie at 7:10. Waited way too long to even get greeted, and between 5 and 10 more mins for our lemonades. Whatever, not a massive deal. Then when I ripped open the one tender when we eventually gor our food, I noticed this disgusting color in the middle. Granted, most were fine, but that's still GROSS. As if that isn't bad enough, when we asked the server to get the manager, it took her almost 15 mins to come to our table after we had to STOP HER to show her this nastiness. Then she didn't even remove my entire meal, just for the food. At this point it was after 7 when I finally got the bill with just the food removed, and when I paid the $16.04 bill with $20.04 the server didn't give me my chsnge for another 5 mins while she was helping other people. Unbelievable. I know I'm not the only customer there, but they served me raw chicken and didn't really fix it. We usually LOVE this place so much but this makes me never ever wanna go back, not only to this one but every single one ever. I shouldn't have even left the server a tip, because it truly took way too long and she apologized, but didn't seem like she genuinely gave a crap (being PG here), but I did leave her $1. Needless to say we didn't leave till after the movie started and this was a terrible experience.",

    "text": "In the interest of being truthful, the only reason I continue to go to this restaurant is because my kid loves it. With that being said, my last two experiences have been pretty poor.  A few weeks back, we had lunch there and I ordered the California club sandwich. The only special request I made is I asked to have the mayo on the side. I only like a little bit and they always put too much on.  Service is normally slow there, but I was prepared for this so no big deal. Unfortunately, when they brought my sandwich it had big sloppy globs of mayo on it.   Tried to get the waitress' attention but she didn't come back for a few minutes. Then by the time she brought the manager over and he offered to make me a new sandwich, we had to leave or be late to our next activity for the day. I scraped off what I could and ate some of the sandwich, but there was so much on there that it didn't do much good.  Tonight my son really wanted Chili's, so off we go. The restaurant was pretty busy so I was surprised when we were seated right away.  We sit about 10 minutes, two waitresses walk by and tell us they will be right with us. 15 minutes later we finally have drinks. (Like I said, service is almost always slow here so I was not upset by this at the time)  We all placed our orders at the same time. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin with grilled avocado, medium. 15 minutes later my husband and son's food comes out. \"Wow, we are getting served really fast!\" I just assumed that she didn't have enough hands for mine and would be right back  10 minutes later I still don't have my food, and the servers are nowhere to be found. Finally our server walks past or table and my husband grabs her, pointing out that I still have not gotten my order. She apologizes and goes back to check on it.   20 more minutes go by and now we are short on time because we have a birthday party to go to. The server finally brings out my food. The steak was not only rare, but it was cold in the middle.   So now my plan for a nice family dinner is ruined, my husband and son are finished with their meals and watching me eat mine, except I can't eat a rare steak. I can't send it back because we are out of time.   Now I work in customer service, so I was calm and polite throughout the whole process. What REALLY finally got to me is that our original server refused to come back to our table. She sent her coworker over to check on us and walked by our table like nothing happened.  The only positive thing is that is did speak to the manager and she was very apologetic. I told her that I was trying to be patient because I knew they were busy, but she said they were properly staffed for the crowd and it shouldn't have happened. We offered to pay for husband and son's meal, but she comped the whole thing.  So I spent almost 2 hours at Chili's and left hungry.",

We had a new server who probably wasn't ready to be out on his own to make a good impression for their restaurant. (I'm only saying this because I've been a server for a few places.. a few more days of following someone, he would've been ready).   On our last visit, we sat around for a good 8-10 minutes before our server came over for the 1st time. It might not seem long but the restaurant wasnt busy (our half of the restaurant had a total of 2 other tables) & we didnt even get a quick \"be with you in one moment\" or anything.   Finally, i'm no fan of waiting long for my food, but i should atleast wait long enough to know that it was fresh. We ordered our food, had a quick 2 minute convo, then i used the restroom to washed my hands. On my way out, our food was being brought to our table.  hmmmm... i waited longer to be greeted than for my food to come out? Something doesnt seem right. It was hot but i'm a little worried how long it had been sitting under heating lamps :\\  I'll take my $35+ elsewhere for a decent dinner.",

He was funny, able to make suggestions for those that weren't sure and completely on top of his game throughout the whole time we were there.  Who wasn't on top of their game?  The manager.  If you want your customers (especially those that are part of a large party) to feel welcomed with hopes of them coming back, don't stand within earshot of \"Table 43\" and start complaining about how long we were taking.  Yes I heard you Miss Manager, I am not dumb, your tabletop touchscreen displays the table numbers and 43 just happened to be ours.  I thought that it was a good thing that the table kept ordering items, going for a dessert round, that equates to a higher bill and more revenue for your restaurant, maybe a higher tip for your serving staff.  What it actually ended up doing was irritating me that you said it loudly enough to be passive aggressive and kept staring at our table.  You obviously don't want business in here because you will no longer be getting mine.  Asides from that huge hiccup, the food was decent, prices reasonable, mixed drinks watered down, atmosphere was meh.  So your typical subpar Chili's.",

Seriously the WORST chicken I've ever had anywhere, and I've eaten chicken tenders from gas stations before (yeah, I'm not proud of that, but I'm willing to share that embarrassing fact with you just to drive home how horrible this chicken was!)  And just the other night I ordered a creamy cajun chicken pasta dish. The pasta was hard and dry, there was about a tablespoon of sauce in the whole dish, and there was no cajun flavor, despite it being in the name! I ate two bites and threw the rest away. I'm not one who usually wastes food, but it was truly terrible. I don't know if their food is this bad when you dine in, but I am DONE with takeout food here.   I don't give out one star reviews often, but the to-go food from this particular Chili's is definitely worthy of this dubious honor!",

Anyway, I was in the mood for steak but didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount, so a friend and I decided on Chili's. Maybe the service is lacking on weekends, but it was great on this Wednesday evening. We actually had 3 different servers checking on us, and hardly had to wait at all for anything.  We started with the soft pretzels. I didn't care for the queso but my friend really liked it. I had the sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was a little to salty/seasoned, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Friend had the Cajun Pasta, which was delicious, but came out a little cold.  I also had some kind of tropical martini, I think. I can't remember the name, but it was tasty and on the strong side (mmm).  We split the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie. Amazing.  Each table has a ziosk, where you can look at the menu, pay with a card, figure out the tip, and play games (there is a fee for the games!). I hope this doesn't eliminate restaurant jobs, but I really liked it...  Friend would probably give a lower rating because his pasta was a little cold. But I'm the one writing the review, so I say 5 stars. Overall it was a good experience.",
