When she brought the food, there was no flatware and she wandered around looking for it for several minutes, brought it over and put her fingers all over it putting it down in front of us. She was also licking her fingers in front of us while taking our orders and such, so that was gross. The check was dropped with the food with no explanation that she expected us to take it up to the register, and there was no total on the check, so we added it up and put cash down on the table and left. Then she chases us out onto sidewalk yelling because she hadn't put the coffees on the check, so we asked what the total was and she didn't know, so we gave her a few more dollars and told her we were never coming back. The food wasn't really any good anyway.",

    "text": "Overall, I liked this place. Understand, though, that it really is a dive in the North Side. If you didn't read about it prior, you would probably not think to go inside. I got the buffet after reading about it on here - but that was really a mistake. There were about 7 food options, including the eggs which were non-existent for my stay there. I am big into eggs for breakfast, so this was a real downer. Then there were 2 versions of homefries, one with peppers and onions, one without. Those were decent. French toast was OK, but dried and sitting there too long. Pancakes were the worst that I have every had - they were charred on the bottom, and seriously made my whole mouth taste like a bad cigarette - no joke. The sausages looked and tasted exactly like Brown n' Serve....On the other hand, my friend had their Greek omelet, and said it was the best omelet she ever had. Light and fluffy, nicely seasoned, good cheese. This place was also reasonably priced. With respect to the buffet, I will also say that I was the only one there that seemed to be eating it - everyone else was ordering off the menu.",

    "text": "I took my daughter here for breakfast after a Science Center sleepover. The outside looks decent, but that was the best part of the experience. The smell when you walk in is so offensive and strong. I couldn't really put my finger on it, partly because I was trying to breathe and couldn't focus. If I had to characterize it after the fact: urine, old grease, b.o., rotting floor mats, and general filth. Another reviewer (I should have checked before we went, dammit) mentioned the horrible bathrooms, but I can't confirm that. Based on the smell, though, I probably would have run across the street to use the 7-11 bathroom if I needed to go. The server came quickly and my brain was too slow to come up with an inoffensive way out, so we sat. She was fine, but not particularly friendly. The menus are under glass in the table, which my 10-year old thought was pretty cool. Coffee was thin and standard. My daughter got French Toast, which was pretty good. Not special by any means, but at this point I was looking for positives. I got an omelette. It came with home fries which were good, and toast with that neon yellow butter sauce that diner \"chefs\" apply with a paintbrush. The omelette was much like the restaurant. It looked nice from the outside, but once I got inside, I was appalled. The first cut in with my fork produced a flood of oil that covered the bottom of my plate. I ate some of it and it was greasy and nothing special. The first half that I picked at had no cheese and the other half which I gave the old college try had too much cheese. Anyone that knows me will tell you that me saying something has too much cheese happens as often as your wingnut conservative uncle complements Obama! I could only eat about a quarter of the omelette, so the home fries and my daughter's French Toast filled me up. The bill was low and the young woman at the register was very friendly. Her co-worker behind the counter spent most of our meal eating in plain sight and playing on his phone. Bottom line: Pittsburgh has some GREAT breakfast places. This is not one of them. This isn't even a good or mediocre one. If you want a cheap, half-edible meal that you'll probably regret later that morning and for your clothes to smell like the inside of a port-a-john that dispenses french fries, this is your spot!",

    "text": "I have lived on Pittsburgh's North Side for quite some time, and have found myself passing lindos' on many occasions, so today I decided to not drive pass, and stop in. I was not disappointed. The interior is bright and quaint and everything seemed clean. It looks small from the outside, however it is more spacious than you think inside. Based on reviews from other Yelper's I had the sampler. Two eggs over easy, three pancakes, hash browns, and linked sausage. The meal was quite good. The pancakes fluffy AND golden brown. The eggs just runny enough, YES and the hash browns crispy and delicious. The only downfall (if you can call it that) is that they didn't give you/me enough hash browns.   Now here is where this story tanks. My server was a young lady with glasses and she was very INattentive. I need a refill on my drink and I had to walk up to the cash register to ask for a refill. She (my waitress) was so busy talking to customers about her recent cruise that she forgot I was there. I saw her at my table two times when she took my order and when she brought my meal. I quests I made the mistake of coming in around 11:30 and my order took a little longer than I expected (do in large part to the amount of take out orders that the kitchen was preparing), I was in there and seated by 11:15 and did not receive my meal until 11:51 WOWSER!!! While I waited I had the pleasure of watching the north side go by.   If you have a chance to stop in, get a window seat (number 9 or 4), relax, and enjoy a good hot meal. Make sure you have the time to wait. I hear they have a breakfast buffet on Saturday and Sunday. I may go back this weekend (or next) and see if today was a fluke or business as usual.",

    "text": "i wish i could give this place 0 stars. I placed my order to go over the phone which took 15 mins for someone to even anwswer the phone. Thinking they were busy at lunch time when i went in, they werent busy at all so i am not sure why they didnt answer their phone. But when i went in to get my order. There was a man behind the counter trying to sell a cell phone to a customer and then he asked me and my friend if we wanted to  buy a gold quarter and that he would take best offer for this coin. So unprofessional and not comical. when my food came out, i told the woman working the register that i will be using my debit card, the total was 14.96 she swiped my card  and it was dialing and then it declined because it was dialing forever (they have no service or hardly any service) i told her i know there is money in my account and she said well i will try again when she tried again it still was showing dialing and pending , i dont know what she did but it was taking forever to process this. I then pulled up my online banking to show her that the charge went through and showed it pending. The money was already taken out of my account and she kept telling me it just says pending doesnt mean they took it out which i then explained to her that yes it is  taken out of my account and she cancelled the debit again because it was taking forever to print out a receipt which ended up jamming. Then she swipes my card again and i keep telling her you already took money out of my account while showing her my phone. which she still is telling me no no no thats not it . well it says lindos and now i have two charges for 14.96 from lindo's restaurant . But i dont understand or know what kind of people they have working here who do not care about the customers and or what they customer has to say . but i called my bank so that issue will be resolved and i will never come here again. it looks dirty inside. the employees are morons and try to sell you things they find in the street and the food has decreased in size. my gyro was too dry - the chicken- and was very small for 6.41. the best part of my whole experience is the lettuce was  fresh. never again.",

Love the old school, neighborhood vibe and the waitress was welcoming and super sweet to us..already we were feeling great. Ordered the 2 egg breakfast with gyro meat and what came out was sublime. Sunny side eggs where the edges curled up a bit, home fries with a crispy outside and soft creamy inside, good tasty gyro meat..and lots of it! Whoever was manning their grill knew their chops like a boss! Yes, to some it's just a breakfast platter..but it's the great little details that make a place memorable to us. Meanwhile, my son is raving about his grilled cheese and fries..took a bite..and he was right. This definitely is a go to place and was an amazing way to start our day!",

So this morning 12/19 I use my trusty yelp app in search of some breakfast Lindos has low star but it's right near where I was So I pull into their parking lot am reading Lindos reviews  Not 5 min later a flat bed tow truck pulls up alongside me I pay no mind till I see he clearly wants to talk to me Roll down my window to a guy with a cig hanging from his mouth saying I am here to tow your car  I'm friendly I say I think you made a mistake  He says no the restaurant called me to tow your car ohhhh ok I say why???? He says because you parked here I said ok I was planning to eat here  He said well I'm just doing my job I said ok then I won't eat here  He said maybe that's a good idea...and I heartily agreed with him and drove away and drove the block to Allegheny sandwich shoppe where I'd been before... Ps the parking lot is about 25 spots of which 20 were vacant at 9 am This whole incident was very creepy and for sure a first   Or was this some sort of scam?  Should I bother to call the restaurant and find out? Or the tow company ? Was the plan to steal my car? It is a  beauty  18 Subaru  afterthought all parking lines inthe lot are painted blue maybe only handicappers can park there? But does that seem likely?",

    "text": "I had high hopes going in, but I was doubly disappointed. First I had a look at the buffet. There was nothing interesting there. A step below a typical Holiday Inn breakfast buffet. Just scrambled eggs (nearly empty), bacon, sausage, grits, french toast, pancakes, home fries... not even anything like fresh fruit, or gyro meat which I would have expected since they pride themselves on their Greek foods. Plus it's $10.99 whereas a quick googling says it was a far more reasonable $6.99 not very long ago.  So I got their Lindos Greek omelette instead, with gyro meat, tomatoes, feta and spinach inside. I was a fan of the Greek omelettes at the Little Athens in Sewickley, but that's gone now. Well this also came up short too. They used frozen spinach for instance; there was no real effort to make the omelette special even as their signature namesake omelette.  So  with tax and tip it's about $15 for a pretty so-so breakfast including coffee. It's not hard to find better and less expensive alternatives in Pittsburgh.",

Much like any other diner, they have breakfast options, burgers, sandwiches, the usual. The one-armed bandit is a great breakfast menu item when you like variety and the breakfast sampler is even better for when you can't decide between pancakes or French toast. The hoagies taste fresh and they come whole; no half hoagies here. When you're craving affordable diner food and you're in the north side, this is a great place to stop.",

    "text": "I love breakfast foods. Unfortunately, I am usually not in my own neighborhood on mornings when I have a lot of time, so I had not yet had the chance yet to explore this place. I had seen the sign painted on the side of the building, but I had assumed it was a relic of a bygone era in Pittsburgh. Much to my surprise, Lindo's Restaurant appeared in my search for breakfast and brunch Foods open at 1 p.m. on a Saturday morning! Even better yet, it is walking distance from where I live!  For a first impression, I had hoped to try the breakfast buffet, but I arrived after it had already stopped. Fortunately, the very first item on the menu, the lindo's breakfast sampler, offered pretty much everything I could hope to want for breakfast anyway. I ordered eggs over medium, pancakes instead of French toast, and I asked for turkey bacon. I try to avoid pork, so it greatly impressed me that Lindo's offers turkey ham, turkey bacon, and turkey sausage. To finish off my breakfast extravaganza, I had a glass of orange juice and coffee.  The food was phenomenal! Eggs over medium can be difficult to get right, but mine were amazing. The turkey bacon was cooked to perfection, and the accompanying home fries had just the right amount of crispness. The pancakes were quite large, so I ended up having to force myself to finish them, but they were also delicious.  I should also mention that the service was exceptional. The waitress was extremely attentive and exceedingly friendly. One waitress was in training, and she apologized effusively for being new, but in reality she had nothing to apologize for; everything was perfect. I saw a few regulars come and go, and it was obvious that the staff welcomed both regulars and newcomers with the same great degree of warmth.  I will certainly be returning often. The decor is what you would expect from a small neighborhood cafe-type diner. The prices are very reasonable. The shows playing on the television where a bit odd though: I watched a half-hour-long infomercial for skin care products, followed by an episode of Friends. Other than that, my first experience at Lindo's restaurant could not have been better.",

I was not a part of the drinking the night before, but of course I was the first one to receive the, \"Are you awake?\" text at 6am.  Sigh.  I was.  And I'm always in the mood for breakfast.  So I picked them up and dragged them to Lindos.  We were not disappointed.    From the moment we walked in, I could tell this was going to be a great breakfast spot.  When a diner or diner-type establishment feels like it hasn't been cleaned since it opened, I feel like that can be a plus.  I like that greasy, dirty diner feel.  The waitress was patient with us, something I always appreciate when dining as part of a group.    I've been here twice and enjoyed the omelettes both times.  That Lindos omelette, packed with all kinds of goodies (including gyro meat) definitely wins first place.  I heard the coffee wasn't the best, but haven't tried it myself.  I will, however, return for another one of those glorious omelettes.",

Unfortunately, I think it's time for him to revisit Lindo's, since I suspect it's past its heyday.    My crew of six visited this Northside landmark one chilly Saturday morning before a Pitt game.  We expected to wait, given the crowd, but were pleasantly surprised when we were offered the private back room immediately. This backroom isn't exactly reminiscent of \"SAW,\" but it is well on its way. Nevertheless, we appreciated the privacy and were happy to sit amongst the leftover restaurant items from yesteryear.  Surprisingly, the dining room really wasn't as busy as it first appeared.  The staff were friendly - in the beginning - and I felt good about our choice. That feeling quickly changed to dread.  It was a full 30 minutes after the final members of our party arrived when we placed our breakfast orders.   At the end of the experience, we had lost two hours of our lives and had barely a coffee refill to show for it. The food was delightful enough; your average diner fare. But sorry, not worth the wait.  We shall commence our regular tailgate schedule of kegs and eggs next time for sure.",
