It was so bland that it tasted like buttered noodles with chicken. Waited forever for the waiter to come back to the table so that I could ask him about it. He was clueless. When I asked him for some of the spicy sauce that comes on the dish normally, he returned with siracha. Yes. That will give the heat that I was craving but not what I asked for. Took us getting the attention of the hostess? Manager? Not sure what her job was? To rectify the situation. To her credit. She did come back to the table with what better filled the basic requirements for pad thai but I don't think I will ever be back to give them a third try.",

    "text": "This restaurant is spoke of often in our local community, and we've done both sit-down and take-out on several occasions without any major likes or dislikes either way.  The wait staff at the tables have always friendly, but on one previous visit, my wife and I once noted how a female \"manager\" was uncomfortably derogatory towards one of her counter staff.  Maybe she was an owner, who knows...but we could clearly tell she wasn't pleased with the girl for something she did. We joked about it later between ourselves, saying we probably wouldn't let our children apply there when they hit high school!  Well, on our visit tonight, a man in a shirt and tie taking payments was very arrogant when I asked if there was duck sauce in our take-out bag!  His response was flat-out ignorant and condescending, as if I should have known what they packed in the bag.  Hey, if you can't be at least somewhat thankful that we chose to spend our $50 in your establishment, then perhaps we'll not bother calling again.  I'd like to think that we caught these folks on a few \"bad days\", but nonetheless, we're not comfortable with this pattern.  And so I felt compelled to \"tell it like it is\" for others to make their own judgements.  In all fairness, the Sesame Inn (Peters) has good food, but it's always seemed a bit over-priced for what you get.  It's good, but not THAT good.  The food and friendly staff would get a 4, but factor in a solid 2 for the overbearing bullies in charge.  Since a customer's overall experience includes feeling welcome...the Sesame Inn (Peters) gets a 3 from me.",

I've never had anything here that I didn't love.

I had never been on a Sunday and I didn't know they had brunch. The brunch menu had a lot of options. You could pick one of the entrees and two from the \"sides\" type menu. The sides menu included salad, egg roll, soup, crab Rangoon, a mimosa, and a few other things. I ordered the Double Delight-Chicken and shrimp with veggies in a brown sauce. You could get fried, steamed, or brown rice along with your dish. For my sides I prefer an egg roll and Carb Rangoon. The egg roll came out on a small plate along with 2 Crab Rangoon. They also brought out a small dish of hot mustard and a small bowl of duck sauce. The egg roll was room temperature. I would have preferred it to be a little warmer. There was crunch on the outside and the inside was flavorful. The Crab Rangoon was also room temperature and the filling was starting to congeal. Not a good thing. My Double Delight was a nice portion size. It had a lot of chicken, shrimp, and veggies. It was cooked perfectly. The sauce was a nice consistency and had a nice flavor. A nice surprise was that you could get a free California sushi roll with your meal. I missed the sign about it so I missed out. The food I had already was more than enough. I would definitely go back.",

My fiancee picked up an order that we consumed at home on 17 October 2017: what a disappointment for $36.14.  The $3 egg rolls were modest size, dry, and ordinary.  My $12 tofu with mixed vegetables was ordered mild, which apparently means bland to Sesame Inn. The sauce was watery.  My fiancee's $13 chicken with mixed vegetables should have been served in a rich, brown sauce, but was essentially steamed, not tasty.  The egg drop soup was satisfactory.  This restaurant can charge lofty prices and succeed because there is not much competition in the area.  I have a new appreciation for the lower-priced and better Red Tea House in Mount Lebanon, my favorite.",

I take it she's acted the same way to many others, since she's frequently mentioned in the reviews here. I got general tso's chicken. A few words about the sauce. You could literally taste the granulated sugar and bite down on it. This turned me off like you couldn't believe. I soaked the rice up in it so it would be less noticeable, but to no avail. It was noticeable. The chicken itself was crunchy and all white meat, which was great, but the sauce really could have been better prepared.  I thought it would be easier to pay the bill and get the hell out of there, since the wait staff was so dismissive. But no. I sat around for ten minutes after I was done eating. Rude waitress comes in \"you done?\", takes away dish. Five minutes pass. Waitress runs through, I try to get her attention. \"Miss? Can I please have my check?\" \"yeah yeah yeah, hold on\" I hear back. Ten minutes. I get my check. \"Do I pay you or at the front desk?\" \"It doesn't matter\" she snaps back. I leave my money on the table and leave. If I had mentioned the bad sauce I can't imagine what her reaction would have been. Go to Bean Curd instead.",

Honestly, it's probably because she isn't use to seeing non-Caucasians dining here. Not only was she impatient she spoke in a tone that was fit for an argument. Perhaps she's one of those crazy tiger moms... So definitely 1 star for her attitude.  The food is typical Chinese-american food. My GF and I did the Sunday brunch, which consists of a soup, eggroll, and entree. We had the general tao's chicken and triple delight. The chicken was good with a bit of crunch and the sauce was light. However, the chicken was served next to a bed of rice and as we're eating the rice soaked up a lot of the sauce. The triple delight had velvety chicken and beef pieces with a few shrimp. The sauce was also light but had good flavor. The veggies in the dish was a bit too raw and wasn't mixed in well with the rest of the ingredients. Overall it's a 3 for food.",

The service has always been good, and the prices are very reasonable. This is close to my house which is an added plus. My only complaint would be that the children's menu is very limited - only 3 plates to choose from but most Chinese restaurants are like this so it's nothing major. Their menu has recently been updated and does not list the sushi boats but they still have them, if you are in the mood for a ton of raw fish on a fun plate ask your server about it.",

The spicy mayo is spicy but not overwhelming and our waitress was very nice. The decor is somewhat outdated but that's okay.",

You get a classy and quiet environment, free hot tea brought out as soon as you sit down, soup or an egg roll and an entree for less than $10. That's what I'd expect to pay for take away!  Although the environment and the plating is very nice (and don't get me wrong, the food is too), you still are getting classic American Chinese food, just slightly better. I got orange chicken and the chicken wasn't super greasy and the sauce was thinner and not gelatinous like a lot of other places. You get plenty of chicken, rice and vegetables on the plate, too.",

Go at lunch and you won't pay more than you would at most fast food places for a meal 100 times better. The staff is also 5",

    "text": "I haven't eaten here in years & tonight I wasn't feeling well so decided to order delivery. I ordered the Singapore Rice Noodle & hot & sour soup.   The only thing more disappointing than the food was the rude manner in which  I was treated by the manager when I called to inform them about the problem with my food. The soup container was only half full & there was ONE mushroom slice & maybe 3 pieces of sliced bamboo shoot. It was pretty pathetic but I had an entire container of mei fun, so I just let it go.   The mei fun was so dry that the entire container of noodles had seized together into one hard clump. It was dry & tasteless, which is odd because this dish usually has a lovely curry sauce. No flavor. Zero. I transferred it into a mixing bowl thinking that perhaps all of the curry had gone to the bottom. But the only thing at the bottom was a scrambled egg that the cook had burned & they served it to me anyway. It was literally burned & black.   I called the restaurant to inform them & the manager was very rude & defensive. He said that nobody has ever complained about the Singapore noodle before & that in order for him to say anything to the cooks about it, that I would have to drive it back & return it, that he would need to see it & that he couldn't just take a customer's word on it. WOW! I explained to him that I wasn't asking for my money back - that I just thought as a business owner he would like to know if there was a problem with the food. He continued to argue with me & try to convince me that this bowl of dry noodles & burnt eggs was fine and that unless I provided proof he was not even going to mention it to the kitchen. Wow! This is the last time I give this place my money!",

I don't consider myself a Chinese food buff by any means, since I only get it when I'm really in the mood for it, but this place hits the spot without setting itself apart.  I got the kung pao chicken and it had quite a bite and was seasoned just the way I like it. The chicken was a little below par, but was totally edible. Rice and egg roll were great.  If you're looking for Chinese take out in the Canonsburg area, this is a good place to try out but beware of the pricey-ness, your bill can add up quickly!",

It stunk and my fiance spit it out due to concerns about illness. The other two chicken dishes were just soggy and tasteless.

    "text": "I love the Mount Lebanon location. This one, not so much. Something about this location put me into somewhat of a depression and I can't pinpoint the exact reason. I came here for lunch and the restaurant was really clean, but the lack of windows made it really dark, even when it was bright and sunny outside.   The service was really quick, almost too quick if that's even possible. We ordered and the waitress came out with our soup and egg roll in less than a minute. I can understand the quickness of the soup but the egg roll, it goes to show they probably just have them pre-fried and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen. I ordered the Chicken with Garlic Sauce and the hubby ordered the Amazing Chicken. The chicken with garlic sauce was sweet and savory, loaded with a lot of veggies. It tasted ok, but a little heavy on the ginger for me. The amazing chicken wasn't all that amazing, according to the husband. It was way too sweet and lacked any vegetables to cut the sweetness.   Although the service was quick, our waitress wasn't all that friendly. She was straight-forward and did not have a smile on her face at any point. The only staff member to ever smile while we were there was the hostess and perhaps that's why she's the hostess.   Compared to the Mount Lebanon location, the food seems to taste consistent since the soup and egg roll were identical. The atmosphere could use a refresher and the service could use a friendly smile.",

The chicken lettuce wraps are pretty good too and serve a lot of people. The coconut shrimp are also super tasty and coated in shredded coconut. The crab rangoons are standard nothing special. Their chicken corn chowder soup which is no longer on the menu is also a must. It is the perfect soup that is simple but tasty with corn, chicken, and egg.   We also usually get their shrimp fried rice. It is loaded with huge shrimp! Their lo mein also really hits the spot. Full of flavor and vegetables and not too oily. The general tsos chicken is also always good but a bit on the heavier side with the thick breading and sweet sauce. The shrimp with garlic sauce is also a favorite with broccoli, water chestnuts, and a tasty sauce. The Kung pao chicken has a nice crunch with lots of peanuts, and celery.   Overall, a great to place to get some take out. The dinner portions are huge and great to share with.",

We entered the restaurant at 11:00am.  On Yelp and google, the business Hours say a 10:30am opening. There were four other people in the restaurant at a table.  We waited about 5 minutes and another man came in behind us.   We waited some more. Then an older woman came to foyer and said  \"Floors are wet. We not ready till 11:30.\"  She was rude and acted that she was inconvenienced.  The thing is the man behind us was able to pick up his to-go order.  I am guessing the kitchen was ready.   She could have offered to show us to a table and let us wait the 15 more minutes with a complimentary beverage, but she made it seem like we should leave and return at 11:30am.
