Wait staff are ok but the long times between courses cause some awkward moments of \"any idea when our food might be out...\" Had the foie gras app. Tasty but would have wanted a bit more for the price. Wife had escargot and they were tasty. Filet au poivre for dinner was delicious. After spending 2.5+ hours the thought of dessert wasn't even considered. Too bad as they are made in house and sounded delicious",

    "text": "I've eaten here and it was delicious. It's hard to find a place away from downtown serving dishes like bone marrow. That was fantastic meal, but I want to talk about my experience using them for an event. I booked Bruneaux for my wedding dinner in March. I was having a non traditional wedding on a Thursday and looking for a cute place nearby to celebrate after. Dana at Bruneaux was wonderful. They work with you to create a buffet menu that fits your needs. Many people don't know you can rent their back patio (with lighted and heated tent) for events. It is as beautiful as the inside. I met with her, my then fiance, and my parents and we set everything up to accommodate about 40 people. The tent had a problem the few days before the wedding date and she figured out a solution immediately. The night of the event was perfect. We had bruschetta, crab cakes, and meatballs as apps, 2 salads, apple cider braised pork, chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, and lobster mac as the mains and brought our own dessert. The place was beautiful, the wait staff saved us a plate of apps, and the food was wonderful. My foodie brother-in-law who lives in CA was impressed-- he was worried that buffet food might not be that great and was pleasantly surprised. They even kept an eye on my bar tab to stay within the budget I had requested. Everything really was perfect. So while I'd definitely recommend for a night out, consider calling them for your next event as well!",

After watching the other staff walk past us with no acknowledgement I finally said something. We were then greeted by our server. We ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. The cocktail was very watered down and we requested another shot. After another long wait we finally ordered our meals to find out our choices were not available that night. Since we had already been waiting 30 minutes to order food it would have been nice to know the 89 items. After another long wait our small plate came out with our entrees. My scallops and steak tartar were AMAZING. My husbands duck was overlooked but they never requested a temperature so it may have been unavoidable. This restaurant has a lot of potential and the chefs are clearly skilled and care about presentation. I hope if we come back we have a better all around experience.",

    "text": "This was my first time at this restaurant.   It was a cool summer evening and we were seated in the open courtyard which was lovely.   There was a DJ which was fine, although sometimes the sound was a bit loud for carrying on conversations with my fellow diners.  It was also \"ladies drink for $5.00\" night which was a little tacky considering the price point at which we were dining.  To me, it didn't seem to be utilized by the female patrons anyway.   My advice is to move on from gender specific gimmicks.    Pre dinner drinks at the bar were done well.  I must, however, stop to mention the use of awkward and unsanitary flat screens used to peruse the menu.   I was told that a local entrepreneur has developed this software; I appreciate their interest in community support, however this impersonal bobble is just as unpleasant here as it is at Eat N' Park.   Where was I?  Ah yes the food.    The menu was all over the place.  It seemed clear they are still deciding what type of restaurant they'd like to become.   Believe the server when they mention that the small plates are small; In fact, they are microscopic to be precise.   Some things were good, such as the Mussels.   Other small plates only moderately resembled their descriptions from the menu.    There was no benefit to ordering wine by the bottle so we all chose individual glasses.   The wine list was fine though Im not accustomed to red wine being served in a chilled glass.    As for entrees, the fish plate was delicious.  However my red meat course was served at a cool medium rather than the hot medium rare as requested.    For dessert, we passed.   Only one option was made in house.  The rest were brought in from a bakery in Squirrel Hill.   I'm sure this is fine for patrons who enjoy this particular bakery in Squirrel Hill.   We all passed.     Bottom line. I expect more from a bottom line of that size.   To end on a positive note: The staff was all very friendly and attentive and both the interior space and exterior spaces were lovely.",

I love a great steak and have had them in many famous steakhouses across the country and also in every steakhouse in Pittsburgh. We are spoiled in Pittsburgh to have many exceptional restaurants. However, none can match the steak I enjoyed at Bruneaux last night. I ordered the Tomahawk (32 oz.-bone-on) last night. It is, without question, one of the best steaks that I have ever had!  Certainly the best in Pittsburgh , and that's no knock on Pittsburgh's steakhouses. It was cooked to perfection. It was not charred on the outside but done to perfection (medium) all the way through. It was incredibly juicy and tender, but the flavor was just incredible. If you want a steak in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend Bruneaux. I assume the other cuts are equally delicious. P.S my wife's chicken was outstanding as well.",

I got a 6pm reservation right when they opened for dinner, and by the time I left about 90 minutes later, the place was packed.  It being a Friday during Lent, I was sadly unable to indulge in some of the French classics that I'd normally go for (beef tartare, duck a l'orange, etc.), HOWEVER, their seafood selection was more than sufficient.  Ultimately I went with the winter salad, butter poached lobster appetizer, mushroom risotto, and fig jam and caramel crepes for dessert.  All of this was accompanied by a glass of wine.  Trust me, I wasn't deprived at all by lack of meat!  Now, I won't be making a regular evet of that kind of meal, but I will definitely be excited to patronize Bruneaux more often since my first visit went so well.  I'm hoping that over time, the inconsistencies that I see in some of these reviews work themselves out!",

I know I previous reviewer had a bad service experience.  Not so with me.  I found the service to be excellent, perhaps erring on the side of overly-attentive, which isn't a problem for me.    I had the steak sandwich, \"Serenity Hills filet, caramelized onion and fennel, radicchio sauce, topped with fried jalapeno and pomegranate arils on a crusty baguette,\" and it was absolutely delightful.  The steak was well cooked and the sandwich well composed.  The root vegetable frites were likewise excellent.  The prices were very good for the quality of the food.    If I had to nitpick, it would be about the decor.  I prefer a more dim dining environment, and this place is white, white, white, and bright, bright, bright.  Again, I'll reassess after I've had a dinner service.",

We ordered a nice bottle of wine, but had to pour it ourselves.  After our appetizers, we were asked if we wanted more bread, when it had never been offered before.   We had to subsequently ask for butter, as it was not brought without a request.    Not to mention there was rhetoric at adjacent tables that made us feel very uncomfortable.

So we decided to try somewhere new and thought the Sewickley area would be a good place to look. We read online reviews for a number of different restaurants in the area and decided to give Bruneaux a try and we are certainly glad we did. Since it was a cold day we ate inside. The decor is very lovely and has a relaxed but French feeling. The outdoor dinning looks beautiful and we plan to come back once it gets warmer. I went with my husband and adult daughter. I had the croque madame which was very tasty. The last time I had it was a few years ago in Montmartre and have wanted to have it ever since. It did not disappoint, the mornay sauce with a hint of dijon was delicious. I had it with the pomme frites which were the best fries ever. I don't even know why but there was something so good and fresh about them. My husband had the Bruneaux Burger and he said it was truly one of the best burgers he had ever had. My daughter had the salmon entree which she truly enjoyed. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend giving it a try. Sewickley is such a cute little town it's a fun place to walk around and check out a few shops after you finish your lunch.",

I had the mushrooms per the waitress suggestion and she was right.  Really adds to the dish.  I would have licked my plate if there had been no one to witness the action!  Sweetie had the lamb chops, also good (I think mine was better-his needed a little more chimichurri sauce in my opinion).  The service was superb, they space out the reservations, seemed like a lot of empty tables for a Saturday but there were no reservations available.  I suspect they believe in quality over quantity.  That is not a bad thing.  The chefs all were busy but not overwhelmed.  The head chef supervises well and checks with every diner to be sure they are satisfied.

We sit down and are then ignored for a solid 20 minutes by the waitstaff. Some of them were just standing around doing nothing. No one even asked to bring us water, let alone a drink menu. Finally a young waiter (around our age, 21) brought us a drink menu and we ordered. Over an hour later, and watching other tables waited on by the same young man receive not one but two rounds of drinks, we had had it. If it weren't for the wonderful couple that decided to sit down with us, as there was limited seating, we would have given the waiter an earful. I observed him tending to other tables wonderfully, and then standing under the canopy, completely disregarding us. Never once did he or any other of the waitstaff stop to ask us if we wanted water or apologize for the wait. We may have been a bit younger than the usual demographic at this restaurant, but our money was good, and we had it to spend that night.  Obviously we knew this was a nice restaurant, we dressed appropriately and were so excited to spend the evening here. Not once did we do anything to warrant such poor service and anywhere that you wait over an hour for two cocktails is a bust. I will not be returning here and I will discourage anyone else from going. Spend your money at an establishment that doesn't employ or tolerate this kind of service.",

The experience was lacking.  Specifically the timing of the courses.  It took over an hour to get our salads.   The bread was a small piece of basic bread, mine seemed stale and when we asked for more because we had been waiting so long for our food; The wait staff told us there was a shortage and they were rationing it. It wasn't packed when we got there @ 7:00pm yet they had already run out of a few dishes. (On a Saturday night?). We finally got our entrees around 10:00.  Everybody liked their meal....although we joked that we were so hungry we would have liked almost anything.",

    "text": "My friend and I went for brunch today and it was delicious! We were expecting service to be pretty slow from reviews we had heard in the past, but it really wasn't! It was so nice to not feel rushed out the door so they could turn tables over.   My friend had an orange juice and I had an Aperol Spritz (my favorite brunch drink!) We shared the biscuit basket (4 very small biscuits plus three teaspoon sized portions of amazing delish butter). She had the French toast with cooked apples (she shared- it was so good!) I had the Guyere Omlette on a bed of dressed arugula and it was also very good. I was surprised at how little cheese there was and how small the portion was over all compared to the French toast which cost the same. But I really wasn't starving so it was a good amount for me this morning.   A few other things to note: literally nothing else in Sewickley is open on Sunday except for the Starbucks down the road. So if you're looking for a casual stroll like we had anticipated, you will be out of luck. But the streets are so beautiful that it is still just as lovely a walk as it would be if the stores were open. There also were very few other people in the restaurant. One small family and a couple which left shortly after we arrived. The servers were very nice, though there were many of them for such a slow Sunday (we arrived around 11 and their brunch is 10-2) there were no complaints on our end though because our service was quick.   I liked this brunch vibe a lot more than many spots in downtown Pittsburgh because it was so nice and not very crowded. Price wise Bruneaux is very comparable to downtown, just easier parking and a bit more upscale.",

    "text": "Robin F and Nathan G did an outstanding job remodeling what was once known as the Sewickley Cafe into this current restaurant. The front has a garage door opening and as well as elegant seating and an inviting patio with a brick fireplace in the back for outdoor dining. It has decorative lighting and even the bar area has seats instead of stools to sit in. Thumbs up for the workmanship in making this place very attractive!  I had a reservation so I was seated promptly. I learned from my waitress that the owner also operates Mambo Italiano  restaurant, also in Sewickley and this place is a now a New American restaurant with French influences.  Service was friendly and as I was debating the menu options I finally decided to go with the salmon filet chutney, rice, lentils, and mushrooms. Although the menu says \"bread available upon request\", I learned they discontinued that service.  I did have to wait a bit for my food but not overly long. The presentation was spot on but needless to say that's where it ended. I found the two end sides of my salmon to be a little tough and the rice towards the center didn't seem to be thoroughly cooked. Other than that it was a decent meal but I would have liked the bread to \"catch\" all the loose rice.  Dress is very casual at least for lunch. Prices are on par with what you would expect for this type of restaurant. Located right in the heart of the shopping district on Beaver Ave in Sewickley, metered street parking is available.",

The menu is diverse and creative, service professional, and the wine selections well conceived and fairly priced. Last night's Lenten sacrifice was the Dover sole, which was extraordinarily good. We didn't want or need anything else, except, of course, a bottle of California Chardonnay. If you are looking for something to criticize, the dining room is a little crowded and parking on busy Friday and Saturday nights can be somewhat of a challenge, but overall Bruneaux is an excellent special occasion restaurant.",

We went on a Friday night and I made reservations on Open Table. You can also sit at the bar and eat if there are not available tables. I was worried that the service would be slow based on reviews but we didn't experience any issues.   We started with bread and butter, mussels and maple pork belly. The mussels had chorizo in them which gave the dish a nice Smokey flavor. The pork belly was absolutely delicious. For the main entree we ordered the duck and the scallops. The duck was delicious and based on the picture you will see that when ordered rare, it came out rare! The scallops were seared slightly more than I would have liked but they were wonderful and the wasabi risotto that it came with was not overpowering at all. For dessert we ordered the homemade crepes with apples. This was simple and the great way to end the meal.   I found the staff to be extremely attentive. The chef delivered our appetizers to the table and then came around during our main course to see how we were enjoying the food. He wasn't pushy and it seemed like he was asking because he really cared. Please go try this place!",

Apparently they open at 5 also and don't expect anyone to walk in that quickly.  The wait staff is dressed very nicely and appropriate for this higher end dining establishment.  But the hostess definitely needs to step it up quite a bit in her attire especially since she is who you see first.    For appetizers we had the beef carpaccio & butter poached lobster.  The carpaccio was a disappointment in that there just wasn't much of a taste; but the lobster was so tender and wonderful.  Dinner was scallops for me that had compressed strawberries & was absolutely delicious and my husband had the filet w/ a lobster tail added.  Filet was cooked to his liking but this lobster tail unfortunately was a bit rubbery.  Dessert was crepes with a fig filling and better than either one of us anticipated.    Great service.  Even with the slight disappointment with a few items, we will definitely be back.",

A lot of the more unfavorable reviews were from shortly after their opening and since they have now been open for 4 months I decided to take a chance.  We were pleasantly surprised. There were some annoyances which is why I gave it 4 stars, but overall my wife and I were pleased with our experience.    We started out with steak tartar.  It was tasty and a good portion size though it could have used at least one more piece of toasted bread. The dish didn't wow us but there was also nothing bad about it.  For entrees, I got the filet au poivre and my wife got the scallops.  We were both very pleased with our choices. My filet was one of, if not the best pieces of meat I have ever had in a restaurant.  It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes with cheese and the grilled zucchini were excellent sides. My wife enjoyed her scallops on a bed of butternut squash risotto topped with apple relish.  She even had a hard time finishing them because there were 5 very large scallops.  For dessert we tried their Valentine's special which were 2 chocolate cookie shot glasses filled with mousse and topped with a whipped cream. It was ok.  If this is an example of their specialty dessert, it's safe to say that dessert is not their strong point.  I wouldn't get it again.   Overall the service was good but the restaurant was barely half full and it still took longer than we expected to get our meals.  The music was also lacking. It was at times too loud and too annoying.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others if for no other reason than the steak. On food, they did a great job. Dessert not so much and service was just acceptable.",

We were seated promptly, though I thought it was odd we were told our table was ready, but if we would like to sit at the bar for a bit we could first.  The bar was literally a foot from our table, but I don't know maybe this is a routine thing.  We had the lobster bisque and foie gras as starters.  The bisque was very unique in both its presentation and taste, and delicious.  The foie gras fell short. The cooking method included the foie gras being charred a bit, and the flavor of the foie gras just didn't appeal to me.  For dinner I had the veal chop.  I appreciate that they cut the meat off the bone, that's the most difficult part of eating at a nice restaurant when you are trying to cut meat off a bone.  The chop was cooked very well and the morel cream sauce was delicious. If I had more bread I would have been cleaning my plate with it.  For dessert we had the cinnamon apple crepes.  They were a light ending to the meal.  The servers were very nice and attentive, but overall the pace of the meal and times between courses was very slow.  I enjoy my dinner companion but at a certain point we just ran out of stuff to talk about to fill the time.  We ended up being there for over 2 hours.  While the food is good I would just suggest planning for a long meal.",

    "text": "My Hometown. We visited this restaurant at or around 5:00PM. No one was in the Restaurant so the person sat us against the wall. While we were having dinner people started coming in and they were being seated outside on the patio. I am very familiar with the patio since this was the old Sewickley Cafe location. We were very disappointed we were not given that option because it was a very nice evening. Had the Pork Chop and it was alright.  The Peach Pie was fantastic. Service was great but very disappointed that we couldn't sit outside. There was no one in the restaurant until at or around 5:45PM. Overall, food was alright, service was great but treated like we were just stopping in for a quick lunch.",

Our waitress Dawn was an absolute delight, the food was beyond ( the Brussels Sprout salad was GRADE A ) and the overall atmosphere was comfortable and inviting. Will return in the near future.",

    "text": "I've recently moved to Pittsburgh from New York and have a special place in my heart for French food given a very missed tradition of weekly dinners with my Dad at the local french bistro.  So naturally, I looked up reviews of all the best french restaurants in town and this place kept popping up.  Since I've moved, I've been here twice and loved both times.  I ordered the scallops with strawberries, a very delicious and unique combo (this was a seasonal dish), and the lamb.  Will definitely be coming back here, especially next time my Dad comes into town!",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in the food. Ordered steak and eggs and hame and cheese crepes which were ok - the cheese sauce over the crepes looked broken. Two of us ordered eggs benedict both of which were really cold as if they'd been sitting for quite awhile. Even more disappointing since we were only one of two parties at the time. This dish itself left a lot to be desired - 4 plain pieces of brioche toast (looked like Texas toast) with what seemed like deli ham and not properly poached eggs over top. Bloody Mary's were good but small for the price. Server was pleasant but did not check in once the food was delivered. Wanted to love it just didn't.",

Can't say enough about them or their quality of food and drinks. We'll be back and would highly recommend it to anyone in Sewickley.",
