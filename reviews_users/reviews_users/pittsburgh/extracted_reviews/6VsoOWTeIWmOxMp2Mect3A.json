I went with a recommendation - Cuban sandwich. No swiss cheese, wasn't griddled, quite dry and entirely flavorless. The coleslaw was among the worst I've ever had. The homemade chips, which the waitress raved over, were cold. A simple heat lamp would make them warm, even if they weren't fresh from the fryer.   I feel a tinge of remorse for leaving a bad review -- the staff was incredibly friendly.   But I am sympathetic to the Soup Nazi -- you can treat me like crap if your product is truly delightful.   Definitely would not return. Rivertowne is 2 minutes away and what it lacks in cleanliness it more than makes up for in every single dish being tasty, well seasoned and very fresh.",

After we were seated, our waitress came over quickly and took our orders. We both had the Hungryman Breakfast consisting of 2 eggs, breakfast meat, home fries, and 2 pancakes/waffles/French toast. I had cranberry juice and green tea and J had coffee. The service here is wonderful. Our waitress Ericka checked on us regularly, which was nice considering the restaurant was so busy. The breakfast meal that we had was very filling. The portions were large, so we ended up taking food home. Overall, everything was around $25, which made J happy.",

It's not extraordinary, but you certainly will not leave hungry. With regard to breakfast basics, the omelettes are considerable and can be built to your own specs. The same can be said for their pancakes...epically enormous, especially the seasonal pumpkin 'cakes!  Typical sides, such as home fries, could use some more zest, but the \"meats\" (thanks, Arby's!) are on point.  Oh and go for the Mancini's bread when possible and thank me later.  Lunch will simply have to wait another day.  Nonetheless, the service experience has been consistent - friendly, attentive, and efficient. I believe there are two other locations around Pittsburgh, so check one out for a fair fill-in to the big chains.",

They've got a real, small-town diner feel. As someone who recently moved here from a small southern town, that's great news for me. Everything from the leg lamp (who doesn't love a good Christmas movie reference?!) to the friendly greeter to the awesome waitress made this experience really special.  We both ordered chicken fingers. They came out quickly, and they were delicious. My mother joined us halfway through the meal and ordered pumpkin pie, warm and with \"twice the whipped cream you'd normally get.\" It was no problem at all. At the end of the meal, my daughter wanted another one of the cardboard sleighs the kids meal came in (which was a really nice touch). It was no problem. the waitress hopped off with a smile and came back with two clean ones.   I'll definitely be going back.

It was definitely different and I've never seen this on any other diner menus. I got a make-your-own omelette (included home fries and toast). The omelette was delicious with bacon, American cheese, and mushrooms. We decided our 4 could be a 5 if it weren't for the prices (more pricey than most diners) and the home fries had more flavor. (They needed salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make them mediocre.) Overall, we had a good experience and would likely stop back when we pass through.",

I'm not usually a big fan of omelettes made in omelette makers, but the one I had was better than average.  The prices are about average for what you could get at a similar location, especially good for carrying the overhead of shopping plaza rent.  The service is really good but the kitchen seems to have some timing issues.  There is always one thing about my meal that is off.  The eggs are hot but the cottage fries are cold.  The eggs are done perfectly but the hot sausage was chewy and tough.  On my last visit my eggs and hash brown were scalding hot but my waffle was so cold the butter didn't even melt at all.  That being said, I'm sure they are dealing with the challenges of a small kitchen and lack of adequate infrastructure.  So it was still better than a trip to Kings or Dennys.",

    "text": "Second time here ... Last time was awesome. It was about a year ago when we were here last, forgot how good it was. Well we remember! This place is really doing it right. Breakfast is awesome. We had the Crab Eggs Benedict and the Spinach and Tomato Eggs Benedict. Both were very good.  We split them so I tried both, I think I enjoyed the Spinach and Tomato better because the crab cake with breading and bread underneath was just a little too much bread for me. At any rate, all good here the service was great from Sue our server and everyone seemed very pleasant ... Unusual for a cold day in Pittsburgh :p Prices are reasonable (see receipt).",

Our drink and food orders were taken quickly, and the food came out after a short wait. I had a hot sausage sandwich; my buddy the chicken bacon sandwich. Both orders came with fries. The food was tasty. Good chow! Drink refills came quickly without having to ask for them.  The bill was reasonable. A good experience...I'll definately return - next time earlier because their breakfast offerings look delicious!  It's only open until around 3, so arrive early, and often! A nice spot to eat!",

Next time will be for the stuffed pancakes or to try lunch. Every time I've went the entire staff has been wonderful! You never have to ask for a coffee or water refill, they have someone making sure the creamer bowl is filled. It's crowded so there was a wait each time but never long and definitely worth it. Just don't get the crab Benedict, only thing I wasn't a fan of but the came with the best deep fried breakfast potato's so I wasn't even disappointed with my breakfast.",

    "text": "The Crab Benedict was absolutely delicious. The flavors and spices were all just right and honestly it was way better than I anticipated. The eggs were just right and the English muffin was perfectly toasted and buttery. The hollandaise was rich and delicious. The home fries definitely could've used more salt but the salt shaker was on hand to adjust. *Splurge and get the peppers and onions on the potatoes. Totally elevates it. The chocolate chip pancake I got on the side was huge and also yummy. My guest got the bagel breakfast sandwich with their new peppered bacon sausage which he said made for THE best breakfast sandwich he's ever had. Also, the prices are fantastic and the staff is friendly. This will definitely be my new breakfast spot!",

The last time I went there alone I was treated like a second class citizen the waitress didn't bring my drink until I received my food and I had to wait around for 20 minutes for a lousy piece of lemon. The manager came around to large parties who had apparently been there before and brought coffee. Not a word to me.....or asking if I wanted a drink?!? Later when I paid, I told the cashier how disappointed I was in the service. The manager came over, I explained my situation and he just laughed and told me I was wrong....seriously??? The food is good but not worth going where I'm not wanted. PS Don't call someone you DON'T know...girlfriend!!!!!",

    "text": "Don't be weary of the strip mall restaurant.  Sometimes, it is a hidden gem and that is what the Freedom Square Diner is.  The Diner is located in the same mall as the Verona Giant Eagle.  It is a way larger space than you think it is.  The decor is a little bland and boring, but that does not reflect what really matters:  The menu.  This menu offers decadent sweet, like a stack of french toast that looks like a piece of cake with fruit and some kind of frosting (if you have read my previous posts, I usually do savory for breakfast).  The menu also offers a variety of savory, like steak and eggs, country friend steak and my go to Corned beef hash and eggs.  (Which I did not get :)  I was feeling a little simple, just some scrambled eggs, some grits (another plus), and a few pieces of French toast.  This was one big meal for $8.99.    Some pointers:  get there early, it seemed pretty busy when we left.  The place is big, but still. Listen to all of the sides - there are a lot of choices They have Mancini bread as an option for toast.  Just go there and make your own decision.  I am glad that we went there on my search for perfect breakfast.  We will definitely be back soon (On weekdays, they have a pick 5 for $5.  Checking that out this summer)  They are open all day, not just for breakfast.",
