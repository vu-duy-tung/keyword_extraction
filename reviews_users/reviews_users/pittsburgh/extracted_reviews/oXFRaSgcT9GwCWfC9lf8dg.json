Definitely my go-to for price and quality, but, despite being my standard, it doesn't have that extra je ne sais quoi that would make a five star slice. By the slice pizzas often sit for awhile, and though a slice is only $1.30, they're only about 30% of a slice wide, so I'd recommend going in for a whole pie.",

    "text": "Yesterday at work, someone ordered pizza for all of us...for reasons that remain cloaked...in mystery.   Were they fattening us up for some sort of slaughter?   I had to play Batman and ask around to find out where the pizza came from. \"I dunno, just eat it\" was the primary response. Finally I cornered someone, tied him up, and got an answer.   \"Pizza Italia, man! Pizza Italia in Bloomfield! Don't hit me no more!\"  I kid the yahoos I work with and the Dark Knight Detective himself.  Their pizza is yet another solid Pittsburgh pie, the kind you can get at any number of pizzerias in the area. They tend to be similar in taste and overall constitution; tough, doughy, crackly crust, a sweet, chunky, fruity sauce that cries out \"I was made with fresh tomatoes,\" and a soft, slippery cheese that just slides into your mouth, down the hatch, and into to your belly. But it's a hella GOOD pie!  If this was the only kind of pizza that existed, I'd be content to munch on it for the rest of my dining days.    It was even good cold, and since old man Crowley can't be bothered to heat our building properly, the pizza didn't stay hot long.   Yes, we are but farm animals. We get pizza once in a while instead of slop and feed. At least the pizza's always top notch, though.",

Took a quick 10 minute walk and our pie was ready for us to grab a seat outside and enjoy.  Perfect location to grab a bite to eat and watch the world go around.  Ingredients were very fresh, the cheese was delicious and the crust was nice and crisp.   They offer pies, hoagies and calzones... sticking to what they are good at.  I will definitely be back to enjoy another slice.",

    "text": "I would have given pizza Italia a better review but because of the circumstances I've recently encountered with them my rating has declined. I've been ordering from there for a while and can't believe the responses I received. We ordered 2 pizzas at 4:30 and were told 45 min for delivery. It took double that time for the pizza to arrive after I called and asked why it wasn't here I was told it will get here when it gets here due to traffic. I understand there's instances when there's traffic or what not but the way the pizza arrived was cold and with tough cheese. I have 3 children so I then needed to take them to dinner when I'd already paid for dinner. I called right after the pizza was delivered and told them I wanted a refund and they could come get the pizza but they said no , the manager wasn't there and there wasn't a reason to come back and get the pizza to call and talk to the manager tomorrow. So after getting off the phone I'm very displeased because I'm now being asked to return these pizzas which have been in the garbage and return them to get my money back. I told them to come get the pizza last night , I'm a busy mother and I'm working. I don't have the time. Also when telling the manager I'm probably not ordering from there anymore he told me he would understand. Very horrible business . I will not order from here ever again .",

It is a pretty easy place to find as it is right on Liberty but I was a bit disappointed whenever I walked inside.  You see we were looking at eating it there and they have no tables.  Thankfully it was nice outside and they did have a couple of seats in front although that left us subjected to the cigarette smoke of the workers and a crazy group of loud people right next to us.  For our dinner we decided to order a XL cheese pizza and also a large white pizza.  We started with the white pizza and boy did it hit the spot.  The crust was crunchy, the garlic and herbs in the oil sauce were tasty and the cheese was decent as well.  Our red pizza was a similar experience as I imagine the cheese and crust were the same and while the red sauce was good, it lacked a little of the oomph that white sauce had.  Overall though they were two very solid pizzas that I enjoyed.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  The prices were good and the pizza good as well, now if they only had some inside seating.",

Unfortunately, they don't do too many specials and their menu is pretty run-of-the-mill.

This place was really disappointing, the fact that it had four stars made me wonder if people in Pittsburgh know what's good pizza and the fact that is in Little Italy leaves me puzzled. I expected more from Pittsburgh's Little Italy and what many reviews claimed to be the best pizza in Pittsburgh. This isn't it, we ordered a variety of items including pizza, wings, a salad, fries, and a sub. The highlight would have to be the two liter of coke we ordered. Overall the food was edible and below average; for good pizza I expect a thin crust with a really delicious sauce. This crust was thicker and the sauce was nothing special; the rest of the food we found to be equally disappointing. I really hope for the sake of the people of Pittsburgh that there is a better pizza option that we over looked.",

One day.\" feature, even despite being towards the end of the 12-pizza day.  I got a small sausage and mushroom pizza.  Didn't like the toppings at all.  The mushrooms had a very strange and off-putting texture and color.  I suspect they were slice canned mushrooms, because I've had lots of fresh mushroom pizzas and they have NEVER looked or tasted like that before.  Bad start.  The flavor of the sausage was totally carried by salt... it tasted like salt and sausage-texture.  But -- otherwise, the sauce and flavor were pretty good, and the crust not bad.  It's chewy, though, not really my favorite style.  I think I could have enjoyed the pizza if I didn't get the particular toppings I chose.  I'd maybe get pizza here again if I had to feed a crowd or if I were drunk, but I'll stick to cheese or pepperoni next time.  To be fair, it is pretty good bang for your buck (the small pizza is substantial and around $8 with two toppings!)",

Be careful you don't miss it as it's sandwiched between other businesses which is typical of this area.  GPS took me to the rear of the building as it sometimes does but no biggie. It's on the same side as Del's but up a piece.   When I walked up to the entrance, that smell of yummy pizza sauce and cheese just smacked me in the face.  The lady working the counter was extremely polite while I was there and she rushed to make sure my pizza was boxed asap. Hell, she even smiled!  When I arrived home and opened the box, I knew I had made a good choice.  A pizza topped with a good dose of pepperoni and mushrooms was my poison for the evening.   We enjoyed every bite. The sauce wasn't overly sweet but seasoned just right and they use canned mushrooms which is what I actually prefer most of the time.    My fellow Yelpers steered me right again! I have no complaints...this pizza is just plain good!!!",

I seen a nice bunch walking out with yummy fresh pizza slices & noticed  the sign stating $1.50 pepperoni slices. Say no more! :)  our pizza was yummy & we tried the pepperoni roll for $2.75. I seriously expected one of those little pepperoni house rolls from other shops (which are great btw) but nope! it was literally 10x bigger than expected. We split it & could've eaten 3 more.   I don't want to hype it up though, because they weren't extremely generous on the pepperoni in the roll. no spot was empty, but I just prefer like 3 layers of it, haha. But all in all it was good pizza & food at an extremely cheap price with friendly workers. We'll be back!",

I trusted my friend when I was informed that not only was the pizza good, but I'd be wanting more.  There was no lie in that statement whatsoever.  We got a medium and large pizza with pepperoni.  Unlike typical places where you get the big slices of pepperoni thrown on top without a care, here you get the smaller, more True pepperoni that is strategically placed to maximize your chance of getting pepperoni in every bite.  What's also good about this pepperoni is that it curls up perfectly to create that awesome little bowl for grease to collect.  You know, that grease that you have to just dip your crust in.  Yes, I did rip my crust off before I got to it just so I could enjoy my fattening myself.  No judging allowed!  However, I cannot give you five stars PI (I like that, pi, pizza pi, such a connection).  You do not deliver.",

Here are the reasons why I think Pizza Italia is pretty awesome and why I think most people would enjoy it: 1) Your basic pizza shop, nothing crazy (low key, easy to get in and out, and not hard to place an order) 2) CHEAP, you get a lot of food at a great price 3) They are friendly  4) The sauce and crust were perfect 5) You can tell they know how to make a pizza (and are not just trying to for the sake of having a pizza shop--- sadly there are too many of these around)  If you have not tried this magnificent find in Bloomfield, I highly suggest giving it a whirl.

They were so friendly and gave us helpful tips on the city. If there was a place to sit and eat our pizza we would have stayed, ate, and continued  talking to them.

We weren't sure what to expect but it was quite good and did taste like a BLT, with mounds of shredded lettuce.   I was late getting back one night and had no motivation to cook. I ordered through the Yelp app and made my way to Pizza Italia. The bus was running faster than anticipated (I know, right?) and my order still needed 10 minutes. No problem. I took a seat at the bench and the staff kept me up to date on the progress of the pizza. The place smells like dough baking, it's a wonderful scent. While saw the staff greeted and warmly interacted with all customers, great vibe. As soon as the pizza was ready, they sent me on my way.  The small veggie pizza was delicious. The olives and peppers made for good flavor and softer flare. The amount of cheese made for lots of strings when you pulled a piece out. The crust was soft yet thick to hold the crust well. When hubs walked in after I ate, the smell of the pizza lured him and he ate three slices. Note the small has six slices.  Great spot and friendly service. It's only takeout, so keep that in mind.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing delivery experience. Let's recap the order:  1 - Pizza: Doughy, and the crust to cheese ratio was far too high. The least offensive part of a terrible meal  2: Side Salad: Cheese to lettuce ratio was approximately 50:50 and the veggies were barely chopped. Ain't nothing like trying to bite into an entire half tomato!  3: Hot sausage sub: Bread was soggy to the point of all contents falling out of the sandwich upon first bite.  Gross.    4: Diet coke: Never arrived with my order!   Will not be coming back.  Thank you for a terrible Friday night meal",

    "text": "So it was freezing in Pittsburgh yesterday. I made the trek over to Bloomfield for a dog walking gig and had planned on stopping at that new PB&J place. They are sadly closed on Mondays, but I was starving. I have had Pizza Italia bookmarked for a while so I decided to stop in.  The puppy I walk has tried to break in here multiple times on walks, and I know why. It smells delicious.  This is a great little Mom and Pop to go shop. I ordered two slices of cheese pizza ($2.60). They were very average sized but a good price. The crust is on the thicker side, and they use a sweet sauce with very mild seasoning. And unlike most places, Pizza Italia puts enough cheese on the pizza that you can actually taste it. This is a solid slice of cheese. Nothing special but good.  The thing that sets them over the top is the owners.  Everyone was chatty and friendly and just lovely.  Support this Mom and Pop shop over the chains!    This place is strictly takeout, and there is no seating, FYI.  Credit card minimum of $5",

So many pizza places were trash (PGH seems to be known for that), but this is the one place that I can depend on. Great pizza. I am very particular about my pizza and this place makes the most flavorful, decently-priced, pizza in the area.",

I ordered pepperoni and the toppings are skimpy. The pizza was ok not great. I still haven't found a great pizza that delivers to Troy Hill.",

They were decent sized wings and not the tiny one biters you can get sometimes.  The price was really good for the amount of food we got.  I won't hesitate to order from them again.",

It was about two dollars cheapper than most other pizza shops so I actually think it's a viable option oif you want a cheaper pizza.",
