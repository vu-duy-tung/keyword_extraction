    "text": "Soooo I was super excited to try this new place. Fb has been popping with the news of Walter's. So I gather a group of family for our 1st monthly ladies dine out and we head over. So at first you walk in and you're like ok you can smell the bbq. We sat ordered apps. (Had to pull out flashlight on phone because the lighting is none) Enjoyed those. Ordered our dinner and again we are laughing excited. Then bam 2 couples come in both with dogs. Now I have no problem with service dogs. But these were not those. They proceeded to go to bar and they actually picked the one dog up and had it on the bar stool with its ASS on the bar. The bartender came over and PET the dog. Well that's it. Ohh yea it was raining all day outside. So now the beautiful bbq smell is taken over by the smell of wet dog and now the unsanitary condition of the dog on stool other dog trying to eat the scraps off the floor was way to much. Now I understand people love their dogs but that doesn't mean I love your dog. Or should I be in a RESTAURANT and a dog is just allowed to roll up in there. My whole experience was ruined and the rest of the table felt the same. I will not be back, and I will not recommend. Oh yea and after the dogs left no one wiped or mopped where the dogs were. So now I'm thinking are the lights dim because there is dog hair all over the place? Leave the damn dogs at home. #sorrynotsorry",

    "text": "I hate giving negative reviews but i thought i should post some things here not to deter people from going but so management can try to fix things as this place moves forward  The whole setup is sort of confusing and the staff wasn't very helpful. We weren't sure if we had to wait for a table (which 2 staff members told us we had to do) or could we just grab a spot (which eventually we did)  The servers were very nice but admitted to being overwhelmed. I guess their WiFi on their iPads did not reach outside so they would take multiple orders on paper then go in to put them into the iPad. This caused a lot of confusion. Multiple times food and drinks were brought to our table that weren't ours. Which was equally frustrating cause our food and drink (i ordered 1 drink) took 45 minutes to come.    I liked the food but because it took so long it was cold. I think the bbq meats prob are done already and need to be heated but if you order something like the fried chicken you have to wait for it. The timing was off for sure. But the food tasted really good, i got brisket wings ribs and a baked potato. My daughter loved the Mac and cheese.  I think other people were having similar issues as well. People started to go to the bar to order drinks and food then just taking them out themselves which was the smart thing to do but then the bar staff was way overwhelmed. There's also no official drink menu only a draft list at this time.  I think these are all growing pains of a new place and i really hope these things can be fixed so they can succeed the outdoor space is awesome and the food has great potential.. however with so many new bbq places popping up in the city they're going to have to iron out the kinks to make it.",

    "text": "It's a decent location and I've been watching the place under construction for a while. A friend and I were biking by and locked up to the bike rack to check it out and have a drink. The beers were really expensive...$8/each for local beer. I had a beer labeled as an \"American IPA\" and it was definitely a hazy IPA...so whoever wrote the draft list on the chalkboard doesn't know their beers. I was also really confused at the \"American\" flag on the wall. With all this hooplah lately about the flag and what it stands for or whatever, I would think that an American-esque bbq place would have an actual American flag if they wanted a flag up, not some weird flag with too many stars that wants to be the American flag but obviously isn't...just kind of an insult. I'm as liberal as it comes, but this just doesn't seem right at this spot in particular. It doesn't fit in or make sense. Also, I've never seen a bartender request people that had just sat down move seats. I get wanting to keep two seats together in case 2 people come and want to sit together, but the bartender actually asked people that had just sat down to move over...the bar wasn't full and this was a super weird thing to do. Staying there for just 1 drink was long enough for me.",

    "text": "So I was SUPER excited to try this place as a friend recommended it, it's right down the street and smells awesome. The atmosphere was strange, maybe because it was lunch time? It was oddly quiet aside from traffic TVs were on but no sound, music blasting in the restroom but nowhere else, just strange. No employees around, except a bartender and one very disgruntled server. I don't think polite, let alone nice was ingrained in her personality. The bartender eventually appeared and she was nice enough but she took our orders and never came back. The scowling server literally dropped our food off didn't ask if we needed anything else (sauce for our food, or a refill on both empty drinks on our table). I eventually went up to the bar for refills and some sauce. When we finally stood up with our purses and started looking around as no service was around at this point Miss Meanmug appears with a little credit card machine and hands it to my godmother whose 77 years old, neither of us had much clue what to do with it. She didn't say anything to us just left it and walked away. We wanted to take the portion we didn't finish but clearly we weren't allowed to speak with anybody about getting a lid as they serve your food in paper. As we're attempting to figure out this credit card do dad, (which I guess she assumed we were paying with thankfully we were) and what our total was, as that information wasn't readily available, a bus boy comes over and starts cleaning our table under us which I mean he could have at least waited until we walked away but ok? ANYHOW the reason for the 2 stars is the food was to friggin die for. The ribs fell off the bone just cause you looked at em. Perfectly cooked and tender pork, sauce was just sweet enough, the spicy was just spicy enough. The Mac and cheese was top 5 all time great. I really wish I could have taken the remainder of my meal. I want to give this place more stars because the food is THATS good but the service was so absolutely terrible I'd likely never go again as an eat in patron. I've been in food service a long time, and I let a lot of stuff most people would actually complain about go because I know how it is but WOW. (I was in there when there was 3 bar patrons and four 2 top tables, so by no means busy, at all, it was 1:30pm on a Tuesday)",

    "text": "Look, being from Texas, I love bbq and have tried it all around the country and some do it good, some do it well and some do it not so good. Walters BBQ, does not do it well. First off, it was a cold late afternoon and waited for 30 minutes to eat inside. No heat lamps whatsoever were in plain site or used for that matter for an outdoors option. It was either wait or eat in the cold. The atmosphere is so loud inside that you cannot hear your guest speak and you have to up your volume just to talk and hear. Then the food. I had the brisket sandwich while my guest had the turkey. The turkey was dry and no seasoning on it whatsoever. So bland. I had the brisket sandwich. So much salt was used on it that I could not finish it. It came with fries, but real  bbq places give you the choice of a side. I had to add-on the potato salad. The potato salad was way too creamy and not enough potatoes in it. The sweet tea was food, but way too much sugar. The service though was impeccable. Our server was great. Overall, if you like real bbq, don't come here. If you like sports and okay bar food, this is the place to be. A lot of TV's to watch the games and lots of alcohol to get buzzed, but not real BBQ is served here.",

I understand that it's new and sometimes places need some time to get some things figured out, but this was by far the worst dining experience any of us ever had.  Great concept horrible, horrible experience. First, we tried calling for about an hour and no answer. Then, we waited 1.5 hours for table and after telling us table was ready the staff gave it away to another party.  Waited another 20 minutes. Once we got seated we waited yet another 20 minutes to be greeted by waitress after getting sat. We actually had to ask for a waitress to come over.  Another 30 minute wait for drinks. Out of almost everything we asked for to eat.  Our waitress came to table maybe 2 times the entire evening. No silverware, no water, no napkins were given to us until we either grabbed it ourselves or asked other members of staff.  Not all of the food came out until we asked for it.  Beans were awful, queso and nachos were sad looking. Portions were small and we all left hungry. If our waitress was any good she would have given us a heads up on how much food to order and what her favorites were. Did I mention that our waitress was the worst!!!! Didn't hear an apology from waitress once. Her attitude was horrendous and she either needs retrained or fired. Would never recommend this place to anyone. Was excited to try this place and love how dog friendly it is, but I will not be returning and I advise you not to waste your time.",

The first time I was there, they didn't seem to have a grasp on how much BBQ they needed to prepare in a day. We ordered three items before finally getting one they claimed to still have. Except when our food came out they replaced it with ribs because they ran out of that too and considered it an upgrade (without asking). The service was also slow and out of the loop. The second time I went was for lunch, however we learned despite their website stating they're open at 11am, they aren't. The staff was also pretty rude about us trying to walk in while it was closed (there are no doors and no apparent closed sign). Their loss on a group of 6 guys that work right up the street. I'm going to give this one a few months and see if they get their act together. I'll be checking out spork pit and sugar and smoke in the meantime.",

    "text": "Service was great and the food was good, but there was a lot that disappointed us.   First, we got there at 3pm on a Saturday excited to try the brisket. They informed us that they only do brunch until 4pm on Saturday's-- seemed a bit odd, but we stuck around anyways.   Beer selection is nice, but a little pricy. $7-8 for a craft beer when most places (even in Lawrenceville) you could find the same thing for $6.   Our food prices were both $13, and given the size, I thought it was a little overpriced.   In all, we got two $13 meals and two $7 beers based off the menu prices. Now, simple math would tell you that this is $40, or $42.80 after tax. They don't give you a paper itemized bill, and my total was somehow $44.55. I didn't think anything of it until after the fact; I wish looking back I would've said something to the waitress.   But the worst part about it is she told us that any change over $0.50 gets rounded to the nearest dollar. So instead of $44.55, we were now forced to pay $45. I know it's just a few cents, but... that sounds pretty illegal?  Just a heads up for you all.   It's a tight squeeze for indoor seating, with all of your utensils, sauces, and paper towels shoved on a tiny table, but maybe this place will be worth it during the summer with their outdoor seating and if we could get a chance to try their BBQ. It'll probably be awhile until I'd be willing to give the place another try.",

    "text": "Ok buckle up and hop aboard this runaway train.  Holy cow was this an \"experience\" and an exercise in patience to say the least. I met up with some friends from out of town at Walter's.  They arrived first and got a table on the patio (which is really great and would be a lot of fun as just a biergarten type of situation in the summer).  It was quite awhile before we saw a server or any staff at all, really...  When the server came to take our drink orders I asked if they had a cocktail menu...Spoiler alert:  they didn't have one, so I just ordered a Moscow Mule (which was pretty much all lime and melted ice with no ginger beer...).  My husband and friends ordered beers, which they were out of at least 3 of the 8 or so potential drafts.  Took probably 15 minutes to get our drinks.  Another 30 or so minutes pass before we get to order.  It was still pretty early, maybe around 6 - 6:30, and they were out of 75% of their BBQ offerings which was really disappointing and, frankly, a bit bizarre.    Actually receiving our food was a total disjointed process and took an unforgivably long time.  Nothing came out together.  We are pretty sure they gave my friends' wings to the table next to us.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, but got pork belly instead.  Apparently no one told us that they were out of pulled pork, too, but took the order anyway and just didn't mention it.  I grabbed a side of mac and cheese and it was the weirdest, rubbery-ist (?), conglomeration of congealed cheese.    Pretty much the only saving grace to this whole experience was the fact that the waitress was super nice to our pupper and brought him a water bowl.  It was a really sweet gesture, especially since everything else was a hot dumpster fire mess.  I have to say that I did feel bad for our waitress.  You could tell she felt mortified for having to tell everyone there was no BBQ at this BBQ place and she was definitely understaffed.  We were taken back by her attitude at first, but overall I give her credit because she was trying to put out a 4 alarm fire with a can of La Croix.  So waitress....I commend you for not totally losing your cool and walking out because I don't know if I would have been able to take it.  Bottom line:  if you come here, come with zero expectations.  Actually, on second thought, come with less than zero!  That way when they have a few things available from their menu you will be surprised!  I would also budget your time appropriately because you may be in for a really long experience.  Would have given 1 star, but the atmosphere is cool so...2 stars.",

    "text": "Stopped by to get take out.  The bartender was great and busy.  He made sure I was updated and asked a couple of times if I wanted a drink or just some water while I waited for my order.  As with most BBQ joints they do not always have some items because they an only smoke so much at a time but most of the menu was available.  Also since they just opened it must be hard to calculate the amount of food needed.  My order of the Brisket sandwich came with fries.  The Brisket was chopped with some sauce and slaw had a nice flavor.  The fries were good too.  It did take a little longer then I expected to get my order, the kitchen seemed to be a little slow.  Will definitely stop back and try a few other items.",

The table next to us was so close that I had to walk sideways between our table and the adjacent table to be seated. After browsing the menu we realized that you cannot order a combo plate such as meat & sides.. you had to order each individually $$. For example, a side of cornbread was 3.00 and it was worth about $0.15. It was dry and maybe 4 bites ( if you have a small mouth ). I had the pulled pork and it was ok.. nothing to write to Yelp about.  If you care about sustainability in the least, forget about this place. Each order is served in a paper throw away container and the napkins are a roll of paper towels. The only reason that I gave this place any stars at all is because the aesthetic is cool and the beer list was enticing- make this your group's drinking spot and leave it at that.",

I keep trying it again thinking they just need time to get the hang of being open but honestly there has been 0 improvement since the beginning. The drinks always taste watered down, my fiancee is never served the correct beer, usually we don't even get our food. If you bring a mistake to their attention they do try to fix it but I shouldn't have to reorder my food 5 out of 6 visits. I want this place to be good so badly but it's like they don't realize that being a restaurant means serving guests. A lot of wasted potential which is a huge bummer.",

The food is average, definitely not great barbecue and definitely not good southern food. Also don't like that the very limited brunch menu goes until 4pm. If you're there to play cornhole, ping pong, or jenga on a sunny day, great! If it weren't for the terrible service and subpar food, Walter's would get 5/5.",

    "text": "The first time I visited Walter's was on Memorial Day, so I wanted to visit again to give a fair review, away from the chaos of being open on a holiday. Having visited yesterday, I can say safely that absolutely nothing changed. The restaurant has a fantastic outdoor area right on Butler Street, complete with picnic tables, some tent seating, porch swings, bean bag chairs and spot just for corn hole. The indoor area has booths, a few tables, and bar seating, but the front lawn (of sorts) is the obvious hub of activity. Unfortunately, here is where the restaurant's problems begin.  All this chaos must be controlled, but absolutely NO table service system exists at this place. The host/hostess stand was in two different places between my two visits. On Memorial Day, my table waited 25 minutes for a waitress to appear. This was after I asked the hostess if we were supposed to order from the bar. I let this infraction slide - no one wants to work Memorial Day and the place was a zoo. On a Tuesday night, however, we waited 10 minutes for a waiter to appear. The server himself was very friendly and helpful, but he was clearly lost among the jumble of people, and he was either stretched too thin or given no structure. Five or six draft beers were gone and not replaced with anything, and I probably drank half as much as I normally would due to our server being MIA.  On the bright side, the food is delicious. On Memorial Day, I ordered chicken & waffles and my friends ordered catfish tacos and mac & cheese. All were hot, savory, and delectable. However, yesterday, my friend waited 45 minutes for chips and queso. It would have been faster to drive to Qdoba and back. Seriously. I would recommend Walter's if you're looking for great BBQ and a great atmosphere, but not if you're looking to do anything else that day.",

    "text": "This place was fairly disappointing. The atmosphere is cute, it's like a little backyard barbeque. The drinks were good, I got a pineapple jalapeno margarita that was tasty.  As for the food. Meh. I got the ribs, which I ordered a half pound and was brought literally two bones. I thought for sure they rang my order in wrong, but no. The meat itself was good, but nothing to write home about. My husband got the pulled pork, also good, nothing exciting. The side-dishes we're awful. I couldn't even finish the Mac n cheese, which is saying something because I never like to waste food. It tasted like boxed Mac n cheese someone dumped salt onto. My husband got the baked potato and honestly I don't know how you ruin a baked potato, but it tasted like someone microwaved it, but not all the way. Also the barbeque sauce was eh. Needed more spice.  Service was meh, as well. The order took forever, which it was pretty busy, but we sat for 20 mins before our server even acknowleged us.  For what we paid, the food was absolutely not worth it, and it's really disappointing. I love me some good barbeque, and this just wasn't it. It seemed more to me like someone trying to cash in on a hipster neighborhood than to give some honestly good barbeque.",

But, we just walked out after sitting at our table for 45 minutes waiting on our order to come out. And the waitstaff was not apologetic about it AT ALL. I cannot even tell you what the food is like because I never got to taste it.   Order came out and the food was accidentally given to the table next to us who were seated long after us. When we asked on an update we were told that this is just how long the wait is, everything is made fresh, etc. When the table next to us identified that their order was wrong (duh!) the waiter realized what happened and put two and two together and came over to apologize.   What he did next floored me. He took an order of the candied bacon off of the other table and brought it over to ours!!! I am sorry but that is a no-no. I was disgusted and couldn't believe it. I will not be coming back.   PROS: + off street parking lot + fun vibe on the patio + pet friendly? (There was a cute dog on the patio) + lots of TVs playing college football games  CONS:  - staff attitude - hygiene/cleanliness  We get it mistakes happen, sure we are all human and this is a newly launched restaurant, but the attitude of the waitstaff and the audacity to give us food off another table.

My parents came in from Chicago for Easter weekend to hang out with me and had never been to Pittsburgh.  So I knew I was going to be in Lawrenceville and we gave Walters a try this morning for Brunch.  I must say, it was by far one of the best brunch experiences in the Burgh thus far.  Everything was amazing.  Both my father and I had the Fried Chicken Biscuits and Gravy.  So freaking good and everything you think it should taste like but so much better.  My mother had the Brisket Skillet and she said it was one of her favorite brisket dishes she has had.  The service, amazing and attentive. I ordered my meal with no eggs, not for an allergy but because I don't really like them.  My meal came and the gentleman asked if I wanted something else as a side, like a hash?  I could not turn down a hash. That was just the extra step they took without me even asking.  The meal, the service, the atmosphere, and of course the amazing weather made this a great culinary experience.  I will be recommending this place to any all.",

    "text": "My BF and I attended their soft opening on 8/31. It was a nice day, but we opted to sit in the bar area due to it being very sunny in the yard/picnic table area. They had a great array of music playing, although I would've turned it down just a bit since it was hard at times to have a conversation. They had a good portion of their regular food menu items (no tacos though, which we both wanted). The drink menu was limited; they had a handful of beers and two cocktails that our waiter had written down on a piece of paper.  We each got a sandwich-Brisket and pulled pork respectively which both had some slaw on. They were very good. (One minor suggestion: place bottles of BBQ sauce on the tables. Both of our sandwiches could've used just a bit of sauce.) The hand-cut/homemade steak fries were delicious and the man Mac n Cheese we shared was to die for! We finished our food and chilled on the patio rockers and swing in the front of the bar/restaurant, which I love this idea. It's such a warm, friendly and lively environment.  I took a star off for a few reasons. Although it was a well put together soft opening, a few minor changes might've helped a bit. 1. Print temporary menus with available food and drinks for the soft opening so people don't order what you don't have. Also,  so I don't have to use the waiters written down drink menu. 2. Make sure there's a lock on the unisex bathroom door. My BF got walked in on while in there.  We can't wait to go back and try other items on their full menu! We're glad you're here, Walters! Kudos to an awesome and authentic BBQ!",

Shared seating does subtract from this however, I spent my dinner listening to the overly loud, obnoxious young 20 something woman next to me whine to her father about all her life problems.   Aside from the cool outdoor area, nothing else notable or much more than average. Food was marginal, service not so great. Chips and queso as an appetizer was very , very disappointing. Tasted like a bag and jar option served up rather than homemade. Queso should be white...chips crispy and fresh not stale. Side dishes were okay but not notable. The best thing we ordered was potato salad.   If this restaurant is going to survive in Lawrenceville and gain repeat customers,  improvements need to be made in menus,  quality,  thoughtfulness of preparation, and service. The outdoor area can only carry the customer base initially and through the summer. Not sure if we would return.",

The Mac and cheese is super odd. It has a very earthy taste to it. Not what I want in bbq joint Mac n cheese.

Whether you go here for drinks (they have an impressive draft list) or the food, I've found over multiple occasions they are both fantastic. I would highly recommend trying the brisket sandwich, one of their specialties. Be careful if you order extra sides though, as they are quite generous with the portion sizes. I can eat quite a bit but struggled to finish the brisket sandwich with the Mac and cheese side (the Mac and cheese is good too). Naturally, with such good drinks, ambience and food it can get fairly busy around lunch and evening hours and you may end of having to wait a little longer for service, but it's very worth it. Also a good spot to have drinks and play corn-hole, they have multiple sets to use on the lawn!",

That is way too late. Also, you're more than likely the busiest on the weekends, so closing your kitchen for an hour is completely ridiculous. Would never go back, not just because of that, but because the service our bartender provided even as far as trying to order drinks go, was completely awful.

An hour and 30 later they keep telling us we are next. While we're drinking there are at least 5 tables around us that went 30+ minutes without being sat with people. We finally got the call our table was ready. The hostess points to the back of the restaurant and says okay just pick one of those tables. We sit down, ask the waitress for some menus and she says okay be right back. 20 more minutes go by and we are ignored so we ended up walking out. Do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through this if you're hungry. It's a mostly outside place so go for a drink as long as you don't mind spending 7+ on a beer. I really wanted to like this place but I'll never go back after that experience.",

I had chicken and waffles. The food was very good. The mimosas were great and the price was right. They weren't too busy so we had no issue getting a table on a Sunday. I'd like to go back and try different menu items especially the brisket. It smelled great so I don't plan to wait long I love brisket.

Too tomatoey of a sauce.  Too overdone ribs.  Nothing was great.   Walter's has come to the rescue. We had candied bacon, cornbread, fatty brisket, and ribs.  All were spectacular. Excellent smoke ring on the ribs and incredibly tender brisket. Ribs were tender and came off of the bone easily enough, but in no way came off on their own. Candied bacon had a touch of spice, as did the cornbread, which were both a pleasant surprise. To drink we had a Pizza Boy sour on draft, which was nice to see that they had a good beer selection on tap.   We'll love to come back when the weather is more cooperative, to check out some of the other seating options.",

To top it off the owner picks up the dog and sat it on the bar. At this point I was ready to go! This was a complete turn off. As far the food the ribs and brisket was good.  The collard greens (which I ordered) is not a must try and neither is the mac n cheese (which 3 people ordered and all 3 disliked it).  I cannot forsee  me going back.

The happy hour specials are pretty good- the tacos being 2 dollars was a steal. As for the food not during happy hour, a little bit on the pricey side for BBQ. The tacos were not bad, nothing special. The mac and cheese was alright, as was the cornbread. The margarita type drink (I forgot what it was called) that I got was really good.  The service was just alright at the very best.... Splitting checks was a huge ordeal and they seemed to have attitudes...

They have a great setup where you can sit facing the TVs but still be outside. Our waitress was very friendly but she was clearly overworked, and she made multiple mistakes. I noticed she did not write down any of our orders when she took them. Look, I'm fine with waitstaff keeping orders in their head, but if you do that, you basically get zero tolerance for mistakes in my book.   Lo and behold, our sides came out wrong, and we REPEATEDLY saw the food runner bringing the wrong food to the wrong table, bringing the wrong food to the right table, or even worse, coming out with food and having no idea where it's going. Meanwhile , I hate to say it but I saw bartenders/waitstaff texting on their phones while it was busy. To me, this is nearly as unforgivable as it gets. You are demonstrating to the entire restaurant that you don't care about the customers. I would mandate a no phone policy at least during peak times.  This place has great potential. The food was solid, the location is fantastic, and the atmosphere is fun. But the entire staff needs to be trained and organized ASAP. I look forward to trying again in a few months and hope I can write an updated positive review.",

Me and my friend stopped in and sat at the bar, it was a little after they opened so it wasn't that busy yet,( It was completely full by like 630) and our visit started out great. They have great happy hours deals on drinks and food both, had a great margarita, and they have good beer selection.   So when we went to order food though, it started with \"were out of this, this, this and this tonight\". Annoying but okay you just opened the business and maybe they're working it out and they gave a heads up atleast. So we ended up ordering candied bacon, a side of their reg Mac (they were out of other 3) and me and my friend ordered two tacos a piece.   First the bacon comes out-good flavor but it's ice cold. Hate complaining. So we don't say anything. Then about 5 mins later my tacos come out. I ordered pork tacos that the menu listed as coming with Pico, Chile sauce, cojita cheese and crema.. when they come out though, it's pork and huge pieces of raw red onion. That's it. I don't care for onion so I purposely ordered ones without. If it would have had all the things it said PLUS onion, okay I'll pick it off but it was plain. At this point I think, okay I'm a paying customer so I say to the bartender I'm not sure this is what I ordered (thinking maybe it was someone else's) but so they remade them for me. Even after that my friend still has yet to her her food. Another 15-20 minutes. My tacos are gone and she's still waiting. We ask and they check on it, finally they come out maybe 5-10 after that and say they lost the ticket.   The owner did come out and apologize and sent us free chips and two different queso dips which were good. (Which was also a little weird though because we were unaware it was for us and the guy behind the bar just kept walking around auctioning them and no one had ordered any so everyone said those arnt ours. Eventually they got sent back out for us and said this is on the house.)   I hate complaining. I've been a waitress for 7 years and I know things happen, front and back of house alike. But just very disappointing food experience.  All in all, great place to drink! Beautiful outdoor space. Staff was very nice, And maybe a slight chance of giving the food a second go in the future when they've been open longer and work out kinks, but the food scene in pittsburgh is on point right now and there's so many other places to try!",

Our meal with sides cost well over $70.00 and they couldnt even give us nice plates or silverware we got paper plates and plastic forks. This is what turned me off 100% from ever going back, we paid for our meals with a credit card but left a hefty tip in cash on the table for the waiter, when he took our card for payment and noticed no tip on the receipt he ran after us to the sidewalk and commented in a rude voice, \" what no tip\" ! We politely said your tip was left on the table. I felt attacted and insulted by the unprofessionalism of this particular waiter which on top of the subpar meal topped my evening. I know its not all the owners fault but i wont risk the insults and return",

Like for anyone 35 an up you need to use a flash light to read the small print on the menu lol. Their main focus is Texas BBQ, serving brisket, ribs, chicken, turkey and pork belly. Everything comes without sauce, but there are two on the table to try. I got the hamburger cause it's my personal goal to try the hamburger at every new restaurant we try, but the rest of the fam got a bunch of different things to split. The meats come in 14,  1/2 and 1lb (or half/whole birds) which is nice because you can get a couple meats to try. The chicken & ribs were amazeballs, I thought the brisket was slightly dry. The sides- potato salad, greens, mac'n'cheese and cornbread were all decent to great. The BF loved the potato salad which was a pink-ish color and tasted like it had a lil' something extra. I think that lil' something was ketchup, but whatever, he loved it. The mac'n'cheese was probably the best, with the greens a close second. The hamburger was on point. It comes with pork belly on it and in two thin patties. Normally I don't care for the thin patties, which can be dry, but it was juicy and delish. It also had a special sauce which kinda made it. The really super cool part is the lot is quite large and it looks like in the summer months they grow some of their own stuff and there is lots of outdoor seating!! Love that outdoor seating",

Gives you a community feel and makes it feel like you are part of the crew u know. We ordered a lot of sides to share, cornbread being a fav and the mac & cheese. Now I didn't try the Brisket but everyone else went punk over how good that was. Sweet potato, collard greens and tacos for the vegetarians in our crew. All in all we had a great time. Oh, the music was fab, shout out to le DJ. Nice vibe and very cool staff.",

I called this place 5 times to place an order and it just rings.  I wanted to try their smoked wings so I ended up going to the establishment.  They have been open for a month now and when you enter its like walking into a chicken coup with their heads cut off.  No patron is there to greet you.  There literally is no order.  I walked in and had no clue where to go.  Terrible customer service.  The worst part was they dont even have their full menu available or any food.  They didnt have the smoked wings available which is just laughable.  Its wings come on. I wasted so much time and effort for nothing.  Avoid this place like the plague!",

Tried ordering a few other things off the menu only to be cut short saying \"we don't have that today\"... We ended up ordering the turkey and sausage. The portion we received for the price was a bit of a letdown. This must be the Brooklyn factor coming in to play! The turkey was okay. I've had better bbq at a gas station, but that comes with the territory of being a native south Texan. The sausage was great! We wished the piece was bigger than a single link. Sauce was ok. A little peppery and tasted homemade. They should consider adding complementary sides of pickles and onions. I don't really understand how they plan to conduct business in the Pittsburgh winter. Indoor seating is limited to the bar and maybe 3 tables? Will visit once more and if they don't have brisket ready upon opening then it's 3 strikes you're out! I'll stick with Smoke!",

    "text": "A craving for BBQ and a curiosity about this new place drew me in to meet a friend for dinner and drinks during happy hour. The tap special was decent with a dollar amount off each draft and they had cheap tacos as well. However I opted out of the taco deal and for the brisket with a side of Mac and cheese. Both items were very mediocre. Of all places you'd think Mac and cheese would be excellent, I'd imagine a BBQ establishment would knock it out of the park, but this had little to no taste and was an unfortunate let down. With so many other places in the city doing BBQ these days, the presentation and taste did not compare.   But on the up side, the staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was fun and unique. I think in the summer months there is definitely a draw to come back once their large front patio is pack in action. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon for dinner but wouldn't say no to grabbing a drink and enjoying their environment again.",

    "text": "We came here for the first time to celebrate a friends birthday on a Friday night-place was bumpin with people everywhere and dogs! Loved the cute dogs! It was so packed luckily we made a reservation or you wouldn't find a table. Around 8:30/9 there's more space outside to grab a drink and lounge, but if you're eating dinner you definitely need a reservation. The place was very unique with a cool vibe outside and pretty hipster in my opinion. They have games such as cornhole, connect 4, and ping pong going on which was neat! The drink selection had a nice variety, but was super overpriced. I ordered the Texas two step and it had a ton of bourbon in it-if you like bourbon get that! I also had the bad arse chicken for dinner and it was delicious! We ordered cornbread which was yummy and it came with a weird white sauce I could have passed on. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. Service was okay and our waiter was very friendly, but some of our orders didn't come out correctly or came out super late. I mean there were a ton of people there so it's understandable, but it was still a bit of lag time. There were a lot of bugs roaming around (we sat outside so we understand there will be some) but maybe they could get some citronella candles or something to help out with that for the outdoor are. Overall we had fun and would come back in the future.",

    "text": "When we came in after 8pm on a Friday it was bumpin. When you take out the outdoor area, it's a pretty small restaurant. Thankfully they set-up a tent that honestly looks like a large camper tent, in the front, so they've got you covered in the cold weather too!   I have been on a brisket kick, so I ordered the smallest portion, 1/4 brisket. It was a pretty small size, mind you this was my second dinner (I know, I hate to admit that), so it was totally fine. If this is your first dinner, you might want to get the 1/2 portion. I also am obsessed with greens and got the 16oz side just for myself! I could have doubled the portion they were so good!   The brisket was good as well, but came out just a tad on the cooler side. I also ordered the lean, and am wondering if I should have just did it up and ordered the fattier ones. I do think it's a nice option to choose which cut you want. There are two kinds of BBQ sauce, a spicy and a sweet. My friend had the brilliant idea of mixing the two, and honestly, that was the perfect combo for me!   We also ordered hot spiked cider. I was super into the idea because my throat had been killing me for days. When we got the little mug with a cute cinnamon stick, it was lukewarm. Not my idea of a hot toddy. Our server was so super nice and reheated them for us. Once they came back, it was perfection. They have a solid list of local beers, but the menu just tells you what breweries they carry, so you have to ask your server the specific kind of beer, since they're not printed.   I'd love to come back and work my way through the meats menu. The server was telling us the meat smoker dude gets up at 2:30am just to start smoking the meats. That's insane, and some dedication to the craft.",

Inside they have a smaller drink list than I expected from a place as large as it is. I ordered an Arsenal Snowbound Cider and was shocked to be charged $9 when the bar and bowling alley we went to previously had drinks for much cheaper. The bartenders were quick to get all of our orders and checked in on us as the night went on and we hung out near the bar. Definitely its unique look and interesting atmosphere are what makes this place cool. I am interested in how it will be in the summer, if they will utilize the grass outdoor area for leisure activities.",

    "text": "Walking into Walters I was a little confused because they just told me sit wherever. I felt like I needed just a little bit more direction than that. After scanning the restaurant I was able to find a table for two and sat right down. It was a little bit louder in the actual inside restaurant than I was prepared for. But the atmosphere was very warm very friendly and the food was good.  Our server Zoey was so friendly and informative that it made the entire visit. She even gave us some good suggestions and told us to order soon because they might be running out. I like a server who tells you the truth about the food and also make sure that you get exactly what you want. Kudos to her.  We got a half pound of the fatty brisket, the collard green sides, and the mac and cheese.  The fatty brisket was very good and I preferred the spicy BBQ to their sweet BBQ. You could have eaten it without the barbecue but if you are going to go for a barbecue you might want to just try the spicy one. The brisket was cooked really well and had just enough amount of spices on it to make it flavorful and its own right.  The collard greens were delicious. With just a splash of vinegar and tang to go with the sweetness of the greens. They were perfect that night and when I ate them for lunch the next day.  The mac and cheese was not the star of the show. While it was good I prefer my Mac and Cheese to be more crispy at the top then this one presented itself. Well flavorful it just didn't have that crunch that I was looking for.  I look forward to try and more of their menu. And for the service alone I would go back.  My only complaint is that I don't like that they use paper plates and paper cups for all of their items. It just seems wasteful to me. And you can't bake mac and cheese to get a crispy top if you're putting it into a paper cup. Paper plates or cups are good for to go but not if you're going to be sitting down in the restaurant to eat. That's my only complaint.   I'll be back, because I want to try their smoked wings.",

I'm a huge lover of brunch and when I found out there was going to be a bbq place that offered brunch I was so pumped to try it.   I was surprised to see that they had a parking lot which is rare for lawrenceville. The first thing we were told was there were 2 brunch items they didn't have. One of those items I wanted to try, but ended up choosing the brisket hash and eggs. The brisket was cut into cubes and mixed in with the hash browns. I was very happy with my decision and would like to give dinner a try. There are not a lot of sauce options; only two to be exact (sweet and spicy). I preferred the sweet.   We were also told that you can only split the checks 2 ways and there was 3 of us. It's 2018 and a majority of people use cards these days. This is one of my biggest pet peeves and I think it's an inconvenience to your customers. Like I said I'd like to give the dinner menu a try, but I will give it sometime before rushing back. I can definitely see this place thriving in the spring and summer months as long as they work out the operational issues.",

The prosecco was sitting out, opened, and was flat and warm. Tried to order food but the first 2 things we wanted, they were out of (turkey and tacos.. which can only be ordered during happy hour).  Ended up placing a different order. Ribs were flavorless and pulled pork was mostly fat. The cornbread, mac&cheese and chicken was very good though. The owner (I assume) came behind the bar because the bartender couldnt keep up. She made a beautiful cocktail and we asked what it was....turned out it was the one we were told they \"couldn't make\". She apologized and said she would make us one on the house. When we asked for our check, the bartender (who never apolgized for lying or never checking on us) said he \"got our last drink\" as if we should be thankful he didn't charge us for the drink the owner made us after he wouldn't.

They should really find a better way to showcase what they have available for lunch.  I would suggest using some sort of tablet where people actually see what they have versus what they don't have.    The service was average. I was disappointed by this since we were one of the only people there at the time.  We had to ask the waitress for things that we shouldn't have had to.  I also told her that there were a number of empty glasses scattered around the place and she just looked at them and walked away like it wasn't her job.   The food was the only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review.  That truly saved the day.",

Brisket sandwich was just a couple of cubed chunks of meat with too much BBQ sauce, the pulled pork sandwich had good texture, but no taste, not even any sauce, (non offered either) and the ribs barely had any smoked flavor. Even the seasoning was a little mild and weird. Did I mention the water was served warm? Loved the fries. Only thing going for it is the environment and location. Pecan Lodge in Dallas or Franklins in Austin this place is definite is not.",

    "text": "Eh.. I hate to do this, but I'm writing this review with hopes that I can update my review in the future. Last night, I went to Walters with my fiance and two of our friends. My fiance and I got there first so we scoped the place to look for a place to sit. They have a huge outdoor area adorned with picnic tables. When we walked in, there were no open spots at the picnic tables so we ventured to the \"inside area\" (there are no doors, but it has walls and a roof, so it's sort of inside, but also pretty open at the same time. We were told we can sit anywhere, so we found ourselves a place. At about the same time we sat down, a couple of ladies sat in the booth right next to us. When we were seated, a waitress said she'd be right over. A few minutes later, another waitress came over and asked to take our drink order. My fiance asked if he could see a tap list. The waitress said they didn't have a tap list but rattled the beers off herself. Okay, that's fine. A little while later she came back with our drinks. I noticed that the ladies next to us had not been greeted or waited on yet. The waitress also brought menus over to us. When I checked out the menu, I noticed that a few things (which I was planning to try) had been taken off the menu I saw on Yelp pictures and replaced with other items. Okay, no big deal, I'll just try other things. By this time, the manager came over to our table and asked if we were ready to order-- told him we're still waiting for friends.   I'd like to point out that the ladies on the other side of us had not been waited on yet. One lady had to go to the bar and order drinks and ask for menus. By this time another couple was on the other side of us and they had not been greeted or waited on either at this point.   So the waitress comes back over and asks if we're ready to order. We said we were waiting for friends still. The waitress then informed us that they were out of all of the meats except the brisket, pulled pork, and sausage. They opened at 5 pm and this was at 7 pm...   Our friends finally showed up and we filled them in on what was and wasn't available. The waitress came over again and asked if we were ready to order. My friend asked the waitress which tacos they had available. The waitress informed him that they didn't have any tacos at all (they were on the menu). Then he asked what sandwiches they had available. All they had was the brisket sandwich and fried chicken sandwich (several others were on the menu). My friends both decided on the fried chicken sandwich, which came w fries and a side of potato salad. My fiance and I both ordered smoked wings (mine buffalo and his naked). I also ordered the house salad and was told that they didn't have that either (it was a salad on the new menu). So then I asked what the seasonal veggie was, which was also on the menu. They said they didn't have the seasonal veggie either. So my fiance and I both split a large order of collard greens.  He also tried the cornbread. Our wings came w blue cheese and I asked for ranch since I don't like blue cheese and was told that they didn't have ranch.  So, I gave Walters two stars because the food that we did get to try was good. Our wings had a good Smokey flavor. The buffalo and bbq sauce was very good too. Our friends enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and fries. However, they have ALOT of things to iron out. They had next to nothing on their menu. They also didn't do a great job of waiting on the people around us. The manager didn't seemed to fazed by this either. I thought he would at least go around and apologize to people for the wait and the limited amount of menu items.   So all in all, I wasn't thrilled with my experience at Walters. I really wanted to love it, and maybe I will in the future, but I was not impressed this time.",

I had the chopped brisket sandwich comes with slaw on it but I requested none. Roasted and buttered brioche roll. The meat was seasoned so well that I didn't want or need to put sauce on it. However, I needed to taste the sauces so I dipped in them and they were delish. The sandwich meat was tender and juicy. The fries were good, typical of this sort of establishment. Fresh cut potatoes can't go wrong. My boyfriend had the 1/4 brisket and it was just as delicious as the sandwich. Seasoned and cooked well. Washed it all down with Shiner Bock, Texas style. Nice layout indoors and out. Dog friendly. Looking forward to coming back when the full menu is available.  They have several style of macaroni and cheese that weren't available and I'm dying to try them all.",

I didn't really like the BBQ sauce that much but that's OK because the Smokey flavor of the brisket and ribs was so good I didn't really need much sauce! Both were prepared top notch!  Reminded me of Dreamland Ribs in Alabama!   Mac and cheese was good and the corn bread with some peppers in it was just right without being too hot.   I suggest you hit this place if you like bbq, it is a bit pricey, but any good q is going to cost you!  I'll be back!",

Walter's is a great place to visit if you're a bbq lover - especially in the summer as there is a ton of outdoor seating and covered seating. The candied bacon is a dreamy dessert like bacon if you're coming for brunch and well cornbread always works with bbq. After sitting next to the smoker, I went with the brisket hash. There was a ton of delicious potato and the brisket was very good. I enjoy spice, but found the regular, sweeter house made bbq better than the spicy bbq and I'd love to try a vinegar bbq there sometime. I am looking forward to coming back for dinner and experiencing the full menu",

I do wonder why their December draft list has just one Porter, but their Pizza Boy was a pleasant consolation.   Everything came on paper plates, I suppose that's fine for take out, however I'd prefer real plates.   I know it's a BBQ, but it would be great to have vegetarian options. For example, the Double Wide has some of the best veggie food in the city.  Overall, a solid choice for BBQ.",

In the colder months, they have heated tent and plenty of indoor seating.   I had emailed Joel the manager because I was planning a Pittsburgh foodie night and wanted to make sure there was plenty of room for us. We opted for a Tuesday night at 6pm - since they knew we were coming - they had reserved a table for us.   We started with some appetizers- we ordered the catfish sliders, cornbread, and queso and chips. The Walters team brought us some of their chili appetizer to try as well. I enjoyed all of the appetizers- perfect for sharing.   For my entree- I tried a 1/4 lb of the pulled pork, the Mac & cheese, and coleslaw. The pulled pork was delicious! I liked the Mac and cheese. I would try a different side next time than the coleslaw.   We also tried the brownie and waffle desserts. They were both very good.   In conclusion, I will definitely be back to Walter's again soon!",

I wasn't a big fan of the cole slaw, but there are other veggie choices. It just seemed a little chemical tasting to me for some reason.

We got 1/4lb for both and it was $6.5 for the brisket and $5 for the pork ribs. If you like variety and want to try different food, the 1/4lb would be good for sharing with 2 people. The slaw and fries were $4 each. Overall, I think the meats are very reasonably priced. The slaw didn't taste good enough for me to spend $4 on it.   Will I come here again? - Probably not. I feel like there might be better places.",

We were seated then had to wait 5-7 minutes before a waiter approached us. A little annoying but we had already figured out everything we wanted so we put our entire order in and waited. Our drinks were the last to come out, but my mango mojito was delicious! It didn't taste \"fake fruity\" and was super refreshing. We got the pork belly and brisket (lean) to split and both were top notch / so tender and flavorful. The chips and queso were on happy hour special and really good so I'd definitely recommend you get some. Even though the food was really good the service was discombobulated the entire evening and soured our experience so I'm not sure we will be back.",

Pittsburgh is definitely lacking with good bbq so I'm glad we are finally starting to get more options.  I went for brunch on a fairly chilly fall day. I was a little surprised the entire place was open as if it was a nice summer day. I decided to get the breakfast burrito. It was definitely good but I expected it to have a little more bbq in it. It seemed like it was mostly just egg, beans, and sausage. Being that it's a bbq place I would have expected a lot more bbq itself.   I've heard from friends that the bbq is very good so I would definitely like to try it again for dinner some time. I look forward to seeing what they do with the space once it's winter.",

However, I can't get past the absolute horrible service that I've experienced several times from the same server who is usually there during the day.   No menus for ten mins despite being virtually the only customers in the place. No one knows the WiFi password, no one even knows the WiFi network. Servers adjusting paper towel rolls and adding silverware and full water bottles to empty tables - all while customers are waiting for water/drink refills and have no silverware of their own. Having to carry my own check to the register because no one ever bother coming back to the table. The server in this case, makes a lot of effort to be outwardly friendly but there is zero substance underneath it and you'll be lucky if she remembers you are in the restaurant once you've sat down.   Sorry guys - you are on to something here with this restaurant but you need to address your service and this server. The overall experience of arriving at the restaurant is confusing and no one seems to take responsibility for ensuring a good guest experience.",

Our server had a trainee with her, no biggie, both were very friendly. Once again though, the service wasn't great. We often went great lengths of time between visits to our table. I also don't like that they have room temperature water at the tables. The one highlight was the food, I had the pork sandwich and it was excellent. I tried both of the BBQ sauces at the table, both were fantastic. I also tried someone's mac and cheese and it was very good. The food definitely made the trip worth it but the service still was lacking. One last thing is the paper towels, the ones available at the table are really poor quality.",

Stopped in for a drink last Thursday and while you can tell they have some things to works on, the drinks we ordered we great. Service is on par with a new space. They technically don't have a hostess area when you first arrive making is awkward to know what to do next. After looking around for a minute we were greeted by the hostess who helped us find a place on the grass patio.   I really love how big the outdoor seating area is. You won't find anything else like it on this side of he city. Lots of people were there with dogs or small children running around. They do have a few yard games available. I can see this being a really great space for a fall Sunday afternoon.  I'm anxious to go back to try the food. Really excited to see he full menu come out!",

I waited until after my fourth visit to write a review, because, hey, I'm not unreasonable, and they haven't been open that long. So, give 'em a chance, right? Well, we thought the worst experiences at Walter's were behind us... until tonight.   We should've known better - all three of our experiences up until this point have been subpar (mostly entirely due to HORRIBLE service), but tonight, our waitress, while taking our order, answered her phone. Literally in the middle of taking our order. Like, there she was, chatting away on her phone. What? Then our food (only 1/4 of what we actually ordered) was delivered by a visibly intoxicated woman, and I had to actually take the tray from her, so she didn't drop it on my lap.   Then, when more than an hour went by and the rest of food we ordered NEVER appeared, we were told that they didn't actually have those items, and it was OUR fault. Wha? At which point, the waitperson sent over the manager for us to speak to, who was none other than... the intoxicated person. COOL. She blamed her waitstaff, the POS system, it being a Sunday night, but never apologized.   We waited another 30 minutes, at which point, the waitperson came back and just told us we could leave. Which was very strange. We left. And will never come back.   TL;DR - it was better land use as an abandoned car dealership. Good riddance to bad rubbish.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday night with my wife for dinner.  We had been excited about heading to Walters ever since we heard that it was a Southern Kitchen.  The fact that their outdoor space  looked pretty awesome too was a bonus although due to the cold on the night that we were there we didn't use it.  It was tented and probably warm but my wife and I walked into the restaurant and were told to seat ourselves.  So we grabbed some menus and headed over to a table.  The inside of this place is smaller than I thought it would be with a large rectangle bar dominating the middle of it and tables all around it.  There were a couple of TVs around the bar and then the walls looked  like they had been Demo'd down to the studs and found a cool wood wall behind it and kept it.  Whenever we were greeted by the waitress she informed us that they were out of turkey, pork belly and sausage that night.  Yes it was a random Tuesday night in the winter but that was almost half the meats.  For dinner on this day my wife and I decided to split our dinners and so she ordered the fried chicken dinner which came with Mac and cheese and collard greens.  Then I went with a 1/4 lb of brisket (lean), 1/4 lb of pulled pork and asked about getting a 4 oz portion of the Jamaican me crazy Mac and cheese.  I was told only the original came in the 4 oz portions and so I tried to order the 8 oz portion.  I was told that wasn't allowed either and that it came in a skillet and was a meal itself.  What was odd is that I didn't see any of this on the menu but still decided to order it after asking the price ($10).  After a fairly short wait our food arrived to the table and we dug in.  The first thing that I tried was the fried chicken which was fantastic.  The breading was on the thicker side but had a good flavor to it and the chicken inside was still moist.  After that I tried the original Mac and cheese which came with the meal and thought it was pretty dry.  The last part of that meal was the collards which were decent.  As for the food that I ordered I thought that the brisket was decent.  It had a well defined smoke ring and the rub on the outside was tasty but the meat itself was somewhat dry.  After that I went for the pulled pork which I thought was alright.  Last but certainly not least was the Jamaican me crazy Mac and cheese.  The menu describes it as  Mac and cheese with Scotch bonnet marinated chicken, grilled pineapple, toasted coconut.  It was surprisingly good and tasted like a Caribbean Jerk Mac and cheese.  Even the pineapple which I was initially dubious about worked as the sweetness helped to cut through the spice.  After dinner was over we were told that they had no desserts that evening and so the check was brought out to us.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  Walters has some really good items like the Jamaican Mac and cheese and the fried chicken.  However they were also out of more meats than you think they would be and some of their other dishes were dry or meh.",

Fries that came with it were fantastic! A pork sausage was dense and spicy more like chorizo; the mac & cheese was a total winner! Very creamy and delicious! Pork ribs were also a star. Nice & smoky, tender, good quality. Sat at bar and service was excellent. People in the place seemed to be having fun. I'd def go back and try more of the menu.",

Service was meh and the food was mixed - we got the fried chicken platter plus some pork belly and pulled pork. The fried chicken was the best part of the meal but honestly just made me yearn for Union Pig and Chicken (RIP). The mac and cheese was way too rich, collard greens were pretty good. Both varieties of the pork were just okay, but the bbq sauce is too sweet for my liking. Happy hour ends at 6 which seems ridiculously early for those who work standard hours. Also they charge $2 for a glass of soda water which is a total ripoff. Overall - would probably come back if some friends wanted to, but wouldn't be my choice if I were the one making the decision.",

    "text": "Stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon towards the end of the brunch rush, just to check it out and grab a drink.   Menu - limited, but food is pretty different/seems solid. When we went, only a select few items plus their regular brunch items were available. We ordered the $4 candied bacon for a snack, which was very good (but sticky, had to wash hands afterwards). Their draft list also seemed kind of limited (for what I expected for an outdoor bar area) but they had an excellent blueberry sour I tried, and they also have white claws for anyone looking for a lighter option.   Atmosphere - pretty awesome. The bar and a few tables are shaded in the area when you first walk in, then to the left of the entry walkway there's an area with tables (some shaded, but most not shaded) as well as a corn hole and ping pong area. Pretty cool outdoor place to come hang out with a group of friends on a weekend if the weathers nice (just make sure to wear sunscreen, because the shaded areas are pretty limited). They did have fans running which was nice, but still didn't help much with the scorching sun. They also have a few games like jenga and connect four in addition to the larger ones!   Service - pretty good. Only downside honestly is the conundrum of if you want to order food/drink from a waitress, you're kind of stuck at that table until you close out. That was fine for us, but could see us just trying to get a drink at the bar next time and then taking it over to the game area.   Parking - they do have their own lot, but it's pretty small/limited (maybe 10 spots?) so I wouldn't rely on that. There's also a ton of street pay parking in the area.   TLDR - pretty awesome atmosphere, just kind of a struggle on a really hot/sunny day due to lack of shaded options. If they were able to get some umbrellas for their non-shaded picnic tables/for the corn hole area, I think that could be a game changer.",

Fries soggy and cold. Mac was the same tasteless and cold",

And like the hanging lights.  But I don't plan on going back.  Very, very small portions for the price.  With the tip included it was over $60 for the two of us and as we were leaving we both said we were still hungry, because it was just very little food for the price.  And it felt like the waitress (Ceidra K) was annoyed with us, like my girlfriend ordered an alcoholic drink and needed to get her ID out of her purse, and apparently the 10 seconds it took to do that was too long for the waitress, because she just walked away from the table while taking our order.  And the waitress was standing like 6 feet away from out table while taking the order, and she kept having us repeat everything we said, maybe if she stood closer to the table she could hear us.  And we asked for lemon with our water 3 times.  And never got any lemon.  And the food is served in like paper plates with super cheap plastic cups.  And I get it, it's meant to match the feel of the place like meant to feel like New Orleans style.  But for the prices they charged, I feel ripped off getting served with paper plates.",

    "text": "This is a fantastic place to hang out with large groups of friend's. We had amazing service (10/10) and the beer selection was top notch (something for everyone).  Things I liked: - Once again I thought our service was amazing! - the collard greens and mac and cheese were on point. Although I prefer a slightly sweeter collard green vs. the more acidic kind I had, I think it balanced out the heaviness of the meats quite well. The mac and cheese was topped with bread crumbs and added a crunchy texture to the ooey gooey deliciousness of the mac and cheese. - Brisket is tender and fatty, everything you could want. However, I thought the seasoning could be improved (I thought it was A-okay, but not amazing). - Sauces were a must, they were amazing! - Pulled pork is also super tender, again seasoning was A-okay..  Things I didn't like - I ordered a fried chicken platter, and I was a bit disappointed with the chicken. When I think of southern comfort food, fried chicken should be a bit greasy, the chicken a bit fatty, and the breading a bit oily. Instead, I got something that was a bit too \"perfect\" - the chicken breast was super lean, the breading not oily or that flavorful, and overall I didn't get that sense of comfort when eating heavy, salty, comfort food.  - The cornbread was a bit too cakey for my liking: I think cornbread is best when it's a bit gritty and crumbly.",

    "text": "5 for atmosphere for sure. This is like going to a cool outdoor party at your college friends backyard. There is fun for all ages and it's dog friendly. It can get pretty hot though so be prepared with your attire and sunscreen if you're not into awkward tan lines.  3.5 for service. It was okay. The place was pretty busy and it ran just fine.  Pretty average. I didn't encounter the same issues that others did before me. I definitely saw some people going directly to the draft beers and pouring them out only to then see them drinking themselves. No one looked intoxicated and I might do the same if I worked there on a weekend. Staff was friendly enough. There were two bartenders. One pretty obviously ignored us and the other seemed like he was doing his best to get to everyone on my side.  3 for food and Drink: they have a Prosecco based cocktail on the menu but they had run out of Prosecco. They also ran out of the next two drinks I asked for so I ended up getting one of the draft beers they had not yet run out of. It was cold enough for a hot day. Just a bit annoyed. The brunch menu is okay too. I ordered the burrito and it's a hefty portion served with a side salad. The burrito was really good and hearty. The side salad was not so good. There was something weird about the greens. They were not light and crisp and I really couldn't taste any dressing so I passed on the grass.  My husband ordered the steel mill brisket breakfast. The brisket was pretty good.  All in all this place is probably a three and it's a solid average option for food. BUT if you want to have a chill outing with whatever drinks they happen to actually stock that day then it's worth the trip. Especially if you have a pup! I'll be back to try dinner and check out the crowd then. It was definitely very busy when I went for brunch and seems to be decently popular.",

Minuscule amount of syrup provided to accompany the meal and our waitress never brought any additional.  Had to request water 3x before it showed up and getting a refill was an act of futility.  Never checked on our drinks or asked if we'd like another.  I'd really like to try the bbq meats here, because what they were bringing out of the smoker looked great.  There are a number of review that mention the poor service, but nothing being done.  No managers to be found",

    "text": "Me, my daughter Muff, my sister Luch and my best friend just went to the Pittsburgh Home & Garden show.  Afterwards, we always go somewhere to eat after walking all through the Convention Center. This year, we decided to go to Walter's BBQ Southern Kitchen.  We got there right before closing and I was excited because I've been wanting to go there for a while.  Walter's looks like a \"pseudo\" honkytonk place.  Wooden tables, Styrofoam containers, etc... The wait staff is dressed very casually and they were actually quite knowledgeable about the menu options.  Since all of us were starving, we ordered quite a bit of the menu.  My best friend ordered the Smoked Wings ($7/$13 - 6 or 12) Naked, Buffalo, of BBQ) and Collard Greens ($4.00), my daughter Muff ordered a 14 pound of the beef brisket and a side order of the Mac-n-Cheese, my sister Luch ordered their Chicken and Waffles and I ordered the $13 Double Stacked Burger  1/2lb of organic beef, topped with American cheese, pork belly and Walters special sauce with a side of the Mac-n-Cheese.  My sister thoroughly enjoyed her waffles and found them to have a texture and consistency that was really flavorful.  With regards to her chicken, she liked the portion size but noticed that the breading kept falling off of the chicken.  She found the flavor of the chicken to be okay...nothing bad, but nothing outstanding.  My best friend's wings had the requisite smoky taste, however, they weren't cooked all the way through and the taste of her collard greens was just okay.    Now about my burger...I have to say that my burger was absolutely delicious.  You can't go wrong with high-grade ground beef, slabs of smoked pork belly and melted American cheese.  Mmm Mmm good!  My daughter was equally pleased with her smoked beef brisket.  She said it was tender and juicy and melted in her mouth.  Where we part ways is on the mac-n-cheese.  I didn't find the mac-n-cheese to be all that flavorful.  It was barely average, in my opinion.  However, my daughter loved it.  She didn't mind adding salt and pepper to her serving.  I don't want to have to do that and still end up with average mac-n-cheese.  Overall, I just have to say that Walter's was a little hit and miss.  I was excited to go there, but it didn't quite live up to the hype.  I think that they need to go talk to a southern Nana and ask for a couple of her recipes for the side dishes.  Plus, they ran out of to-go containers and we had to wrap our leftovers in aluminum foil.    I'll go back again and see how things pan out.  Maybe we hit them during an off night.",

I wish Walter's would dispense with the idea of waitstaff for the tables. Now that I see other reviews, it doesn't look like I'm alone. Even on a Sunday morning where half the place still had open seating, service was slow and anything but attentive. Two of our four entrees were initially dropped off, then about 5 minutes later, the third one was dropped off, but it was the wrong entree, but of course no chance to point that out till the fourth entree was dropped off...that gave a chance to mention to the waiter that the 3rd entree was wrong and of course another wait until the correct one was delivered. To the management, why not dispense with the idea of having untrained, unsupervised waitstaff, and just have an order window where after placing your order you return to pickup your order and carry it to the table yourself? Same could be done with the drinks too.  How can so many comments about the service go unaddressed for so long???? I guess if you're making money in spite of it all, it doesn't matter??? You have a great quality product with your food, so with the service, why not either fix it or forget it?",

    "text": "Update to the update time! MOST IMPORTANT: ONLY GO FOR A 5PM DINNER OR FOR BEER. Do Not Go at normal dining hours for dinner.    Walters is back down to 3 stars, rounding up; and that's being generous. Reasons? Here they are.    1) They charge $4.50 for Yuengling.  Yeah, you read that right. Might as well be a BYOB for the beer prices they charge (tap beers are $6.50-$8 or $9).  2) I realize restaurants like Walters cannot predict people just parking their butts at tables and not leaving, but, still, provide customers who are coming for dinner at a normal dining hour an update. I know, in this day and age, that sounds entitled, but it's kind of courtesy.  Something just like \"Hey, it's gonna be a longer wait, sorry about that.\" We showed up tonight, as a total group of 5 (a friend was in toen visiting and wanted to check out Walters) and were told, upon getting to Walters at 7, that it'd be an hour only wait; that's not bad. Fast forward to 8:30. There was no text message, multiple tables had been moved around and marked as reserved and when we went up to ask, we were told it'd be another hour!   We left and got food down the street.  As we place our food order there, our group got the text from Walters that our table was ready.  Too little too late!  Like i said, i get that in the restaurant business you can't control how long people stay, especially at a hopping and social place like Walters, But if you're gonna be at capacity at 7pm on a Saturday and exist in Lawrenceville, you're clearly too ambitious for your britches.  3) Walters tonight felt less like a BBQ restaurant and more like your high-end brewpub that happened to serve BBQ. It was bro-central tonight, on top of that.    Walters is where you go with friends for drinks after dinner, or maybe a 5pm dinner right when they open. That's it.   Be better Walters, be better.  We're not gonna be back.",

    "text": "So I went back to Walter's....  THIS year they added a tent outside and made it into an outdoor lounge with lounge seating and added a long bar table.   The menu was the same and they had most food except their brunch.   Being warm out it was extremely crowded and it took over an hour to get seated. It was filled with college, frat and locals dressed in their sexy summer clothes.   I ordered the corn bread and chicken and waffles. I expected to get homemade food.... but I was wrong....  My cornbread was ok but a little dry. It did come with some cream for dipping which made a difference.  THEN I got my chicken and waffles. The waffles were good and homemade. The chicken was another story. I thought I would get a nice piece of southern fried chicken. Instead I got a frozen chicken cutlet with some sprinkled on breading that was as dry as bone! I gagged all the way to the end of this dinner. While eating, the neighbor's dog was sniffing me and trying to eat my fork!  I don't understand why they are serving frozen food when the catch is that they are making homemade southern food in a barbecue pit?  I needed a breather so I went and sat on the side where they have a garden. Whilst sitting there some drunk kid and his girlfriend walked up to me and accused me of stealing their phone. Later...  they found it at the hostess stand...   The food here is always hit or miss. The venue is a cool place to hang out for the summer as long as you don't get beat up.",

We arrived at the same time. High prices for what you get, 50 bucks for six slices of brisket, too salty mac and cheese and two beers. Had to grab our own silverware and cut my finger on the bottom of the chair while pulling it in closer to the table. They must have been thrown away from a school at some point. Glad I got that tetanus shot a few years ago!  The meat itself is acceptable, but hopefully it improves with time. I got a lot of fat on my small portion (supposedly half pound) of brisket. Pittsburgh is a tough city to find good BBQ, but Walter's is low on my list.  I have to give anyone credit for attempting to make BBQ, it can be tough to get right. I'd say work on the basic sides then give it more value, soul, and southern hospitality. It's nice to have a big plate of meat and sides per typical BBQ joint. Not really into clubbing while being served \"small plates\" for BBQ. Hope to try again in the future when the growing pains are sorted out.",

    "text": "I went to Walters for the 3rd time tonight and must say my experience was quite disappointing. My boyfriend and I got there around 7pm. The outside and inside seating we're both full so we put our names in for a table and went to the bar. We got a drink and waited for our table. They weren't very busy and I noticed they were seating everyone who came in after us but we never got the phone call our table was ready. Eventually we finally went to the bar to close out our tab. While at the bar I noticed the hostess who took my name down was talking with her friends at the bar and not paying attention to anything going on. We eventually went up to a waitress and asked what the wait time was. They clearly were annoyed with the hostess and seated us right away. Our waitress was very nice but I do feel like the food didn't wow me like it did the first time. I'll go again because of the convenience of living close but it is disappointing. They have been open over a month now so you would think their service problems would be figured out by now",

We arrived around 3:00pm on a Friday and they were out of almost everything we wanted, including tacos (how are you out of ALL tacos?), cornbread, brisket, and pulled pork. My husband ended up having some chicken and I had a side of collard greens. Both were okay - not spectacular but not horrible. We left hungry and went across the street to Bahn Mi & Ti (where people were SO friendly and the food was good - I'll be writing a separate positive review for this place).  The indoor seating at Walter's is minimal, so I'm not sure what they're going to do in the winter. We sat outdoors, where the silverware (which consisted of one fork - huh?) sits in a container on the table and where the flies and bees buzz in the air around you. I guess you risk dealing with bugs when sitting outside, but the bees really inconvenienced myself and a diner at another table. I almost knocked over a server with a tray full of food while doing one of my \"run away from the bees\" dances. Overall, there was not a single positive thing about Walter's and I can't recommend them. I should have listened to the other negative reviews. . .",

We arrived at 1pm on Saturday and discovered that they only serve brunch from 11-4 and dinner from 5 to \"sold out.\"  Who eats brunch all day and would that mean no food from 4-5? They have a lunch menu which is posted on line but nothing was mentioned on their site about lunch only being served during the week. In addition to that it took quite some time before the server came to our table. The place was not busy. The nail in the coffin was when the server tried to convince us that many of the brunch items were really \"dinner food.\" Went to North Park Lounge and had great food and excellent service.",

They also happily accommodated splitting the check multiple ways, which was awesome of our server. The brisket and pulled pork were both delicious, as were the buffalo wings! The beer selection is good, though they were out of several drafts, which seemed kind of strange, and it's on the expensive side for Pittsburgh ($8!). The sides we're generally underwhelming, and there weren't a lot of vegetable options (no green beans or okra!). Prices are high, especially considering that you order a la carte, and there isn't a dinner plate option. Speaking of plates, the presentation was very casual, given the prices. If we were in a southern city all of this would warant a poor review, but Walter's is still the best BBQ we've had in Pittsburgh!",

The meats were seasoned just right and didn't need any sauce, but their sauces are good so, win win. Mac n cheese had a crunchy crumb crust and wasn't overly wet or gloopy. Potato salad was southern style but with some zing and extra vegetables thrown in for crunch. Wings were fine, fried just right and decent size. We got only six and they were all drummies, not sure if that was by design. Good beer selection.",

Anyways the server says out of the lost of 10 things listed on the menu for lunch only 3 things were available so right there I knew we were in for a weird time. Only thing they had was breakfast burrito , chicken and waffle, avocado toast ( imagine that ). We ordered the breakfast burrito which did turn out to be very tasty except for the side salad of straight up raw greens and some dressing. One bite and I had to spit it out. Chicken and waffles were ok. Waffle was very good , chicken was dry dry dry . Oh also they did have wings so I got 6 . Came out no smoke taste and the most rubbery wings I've ever had.(7 dollars for 6 of them). So 40 dollars for 2 entrees and a beer , not a cup of coffee to be found and once we got our food our server must have left the county. Everyone else enjoy, I know hundreds of other places so much better.",

I knew when I saw this place being built that it would be popular as it's in a very central location in Lawrenceville and offers a great outdoor area.  We sat at the bar because there was a 30-45 minute wait for a table. The inside is small with about 10 tables. Plenty of seating outside but I don't see how seating will work when winter hits.  One bartender (blonde bob) was rude when we were attempting to order drinks. We paused and she was like \"oh not ready\" and walked away. Luckily another very nice bartender waited on us.  The food was SLOW but like I said the place was PACKED! The bartender gave us a complimentary drink for our wait which we appreciated!  We ordered the smoked chicken wings with BBQ sauce and they were very good. I had the Bad Arse Chicken Sandwich sandwich and it was delicious...messy but good. The fries that came with it also we good.  I gave this place a 4 star review because the food was good and I feel like they have so much potential.

We had the small order of ribs, small order of pork belly, small mac and cheese, small potato salad and a piece of corn bread. The ribs and pork belly were good. The mac and cheese was decent, and the potato salad was sub par. I didn't care for the corn bread at all. It had an odd grassy sort of smell to it. They have two different BBQ sauces on the table. One didn't have a label, and I didn't care for it at all, and I really have never tried a BBQ I didn't like. The other sauce was sweet an spicy and was decent. Our server was minimally attentive, and none of the other workers there gave us the time of day even though it was a seat yourself place with no signage to tell you that. When we asked, a worker rolled her eyes and nodded yes we should seat ourselves. All in all, the meal was below average and I doubt we would return",

She made sure to let us know we were almost seated with multiple updates. When we were sat and didn't have a waitress for 10 minutes, we told her and she was on it! Our waitress, however, was not great. One of the people I was dining with ordered something and the waitress told her about 15 minutes later that they were out of that item. In any other circumstance, EVERY waiter/waitress I've ever had told us immediately if something was not available anymore. The same waitress also forgot about my drink and when I asked her about 15 minutes later, I saw her rush over and have the bartender make my drink. To top it off, the bill was incorrect as she had charged us for more than we ordered. I can't tell if she didn't care, or just wasn't paying attention, but overall it was a terrible experience dealing with her. I will say, again, the hostess was outstanding and everyone else we dealt with was excellent.

The second time I went, I waited 26 minutes for service after asking the host for help. This was on a Wednesday. I left. Someone convinced me to try it one more time. The service improved but the beer and food did not. Our draughts were warm and tasted off like they had been mixed with a cheap domestic( We ordered the Bronx built for this, Cigar City Jai Lai, and Pizza boy Hazelton native. The food once again was not hot. I hope y' all improve but I'll stick to the decent Bar-b-que joints in Homewood.",

This place is bursting with potential and you can tell it's more than hype. I've since been back. Wicked brisket and a distinct attitude. Have you seen the damn smoker? Whoever this Walter guy is, I want to meet him.  To anyone who complained about them running out of food during soft launch: Get a time machine and show up earlier, because it was worth it. Or just come back now. They are clearly getting up to speed in a hurry and are going to be a big deal.",

While there were menu issues when they opened (most of the menu was unavailable) my husband and I ordered fatty brisket, ribs, Mac and cheese, cornbread and queso. Go big or go home. Brisket is mouth-watering and something I would always recommend. The other sides I enjoyed but the Mac and cheese was just too bland for my liking. It might be better as a base for a meal that I see they now offer.  The second visit I had the Bad Arse Fried Chicken sandwich and I said I wouldn't eat the entire thing. But I did. The breading was seasoned and had a nice bit of crunch to it. I ordered fries as my side and tried some of my husband's potato salad and it was great as well. It's more of a mustard based potato salad with I personally love.",

Visit 1: My \"brisket\" breakfast burrito had 2 tiny bites of brisket in it - allll eggs. Waitress forgot my drink for 20 minutes and never checked on us. Visit 2: bartender pushed the brisket sandwich as the \"always go to\" but it was more bread and coleslaw than meat - maybe an 1/8 of a cup... Once again, never checked in till long after I was done.

The food at this restaurant was TOP NOTCH. My mom and I split portions of the brisket and the pulled pork. Both were amazing! We also had coleslaw, corn bread, and the mac & cheese. I was trying to save some of the food to take home for leftovers, but it was so good that I left with a full, happy belly. I was ready to go back again the next night for more.  The only (minor) suggestion would be to have a more detailed beer list. I wanted a lighter ale, but wanted to try something that wasn't Miller Lite. I couldn't figure out by the list which one would be suitable, and my waitress was also unsure of which one to recommend.",

Tasty sauce, but semi stale roll, and minimal meat action. This place will still crush it in the summertime because of their outdoor game setup and Lawrenceville location, but winters are probably going to be rough for them if they don't pick up their food game. I'd come here to drink beer and people watch, but probably not to eat again.",

Despite running out of many items, the food we got was all quite delicious (pork, ribs, brisket, Mac n cheese, collard greens). A group of us even took a pen to the menu and circled all the typo errors in attempt to provide feedback prior to the grand opening.  We returned a few weeks later having high hopes they had hit their groove. Our food was cold and they had run out of several things on the menu (we were there at noon). The best way I can describe the issues we encountered is there has to be a management problem.   Suggestions to Walters: 1. Fix the spelling errors. (See pictures). In Pittsburgh you can't spell Steelers, \"steal\"ers. 2. Change the brunch menu. You pride yourself on bbq but there is very little offered til 4pm on Saturday's and Sunday's. Disappointing. 3. Inventory. Both times we've been back southern staples such as cornbread and various meats have not been available.  Please note, the staff is super friendly and I think there is a lot of potential here!!",

When you are in an extremely popular area like Lawrenceville, you have to have everything at hand, but the did not.  My co-workers requested a Merlot and a Pinot Grigio, which they had neither. They we asked we asked for a tequila and tonic and they had no tonic. Again a huge mistake by a popular bar in the area. Upon ordering our lunches, we were informed they had no smoked  barbacue half chicken, isn't this a barbecue restaurant????  We did order other items off the menu which were good, but not outstanding, which is what we expected out of a restaurant in a prime location.   We hope things get better, but they definitely need help in quite a few areas.",

I tried Walter's opening weekend and they were out of pretty much everything but service was pretty good so I figured I'd give them benefit of the doubt and go back.   My friends and I sat in the tented area which was cozy enough. Immediately though, the waitress had the worst attitude. She acted as though we were an annoyance to her the minute she walked over. Funny enough, she stood over all of our shoulders and watched us tip her too. She deserved less than we all gave her but we felt so uncomfortable.   The first time visiting, everything was really dry like it had been sitting out or something. Mac and cheese, chicken, and fries. This time, I didn't like the brisket sandwich at all. The taste just wasn't right. The bread was awesome, queso wasn't bad, but I was really disappointed. Drinks also took a solid 30 minutes and there wasn't even a wait.    Overall, I feel like the concept of this place is awesome, especially in the summer. Execution leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "SAVE YOURSELF THE TRIP! My friends and I were first time guests at Walter's BBQ in Lawrenceville on Saturday 4/13/19. Usually I am not one to complain but from the get go everything went downhill. *BEWARE* We got to Walter's a little after 6 about 6:30 pm . As we were told our wait time would be an hour. After we put in our names we decided to wait it out and get drinks at the bar, which was at least a 15 min wait until someone took care of us. As we went to the out door area we stood in the back of the patio area for 2 hours to get our notification about our table. I asked the hostess at one point how much longer when I was told \" about an hour\" I said we have already been waiting over the hour, the time we were told when we got there around 6:30. But we decided to keep waiting as we had already been there already for so long. She said \" I cant help it people just don't get up from the tables\". This is where the night just went horribly wrong. I got a call from the hostess at 8:13 pm to notify us about our table. I called them back literally 8:15pm ( I have photos for proof) as I have never got a call from this number before. We were not notified we would get a call or a text notification.I then went to the host that was obnoxiously rude to which I questioned \" excuse me,  did you just call my name is Ashley . She replied \"oh yes I called and you didn't pick up, so I gave away your table\" .... I got 2 mins. Literally. That was it. Not even a 5 min wait for me to go up to the host and walk through the crowd of people.  So she said our table would be next. After we had already waited 2 hours. As we waited longer we were finally seated. Not once was there an apology for any of this. We got seated by the bar at a table to which we were screaming at each other to talk. Our waitress came and we ordered food. She was a younger blonde. We ordered more drinks and water as well as our meals. Our food came about 30 mins later but the sauce at the table was empty.  Our waitress NEVER once checked on us. The food was great but the service was SUPER poor. Finally as we were done eating I flagged down our waitress as she was standing folding silverware two tables behind us. She then told me to wait when I said \"excuse me you're our waitress right?, we have a question.\" She finally came over as we told her, when we first ordered a long time ago we had asked for water as well as drinks about and hour ago and never got anything. She said \"ok?\" We didn't even get WATER. We paid our bill and no apology or reason for any of this was given. As first time guests we were very much disappointed by our very poor service. We bought multiple drinks while waiting and bought food and this is what we got in return?! I spoke to a man on my way out by the name of Oscar wearing a red shirt who said he was \" kinda\" the manager and told me sorry but you can email the manager from our website the email is on there. With no email to be found. Such a shame for such great food. Im sad to say we cant say anything good about our experience. We had high hopes. Save yourself the trouble",
