    "text": "I was SO excited to hear that Pittsburgh Poke opened downtown! I'm always on the search for healthy options, and I tend to lean toward Asian cuisines, and I LOVE sushi. The restaurant is located where \"Irrawaddy\" (another Asian food place) was. I don't know if it's the same owners or someone new, but I also like Irrawaddy and hoped Poke would be just as good, if not better.  And it was!  I opted for a Poke bowl, custom, as opposed to one of the ones on their menu. The place works very much like Hello Bistro, but with raw fish options and add-ons that are associated with Asian food. I was in food heaven...just looking at the options in front of me had my mouth watering. I started with a base of quinoa and mixed greens. (The greens are actually greens, and not ice burg crap lettuce. Bonus!) You get 2 proteins - I chose tuna and salmon. My mix-ins included scallions, carrots, cucumber, kale, and radishes. My toppings included sesame seeds, tempura flake, and seaweed salad.  When it came time to put things together, I was a little confused about how and why they assemble the way they do. The lettuce and quinoa and lettuce went down first in the to-go bowl and it was a good portion. Then into a separate metal bowl, the proteins and *some* of the \"mix-ins\" went. I chose a combination of sauces - their house poke sauce and the spicy miso sauce. They ladled the sauces into the metal bowl and sorta mixed it, then put the contents of the metal bowl on top of the greens and quinoa, then added the \"toppings.\" Immediately my thought was \"great, the top half of the bowl will be awesome, and I'll be stuck with dry greens and quinoa.\"  And, disappointingly, that's exactly what happened. I don't really get the rhyme or reason behind this unusual assembly. Why not sauce the entire bowl, instead of mixing it in with only the contents of the metal bowl. It was odd and I ended up flipping the whole thing out of the bowl it came in so that I could cut up the lettuce and try to distribute the sauce a bit more. Next time, I will request sauce on the base AND on the stuff in the metal bowl so that it distributes better.  That's really the only sort of negative thing I have to say, though! The staff was friendly and smiley, the food was fresh and delicious and I will most definitely be going back! Great value, too!",

    "text": "First off, I have to give these folks *major* props for even attempting poke service in Pittsburgh. Second, I fully recognize that we're never going to have a Suisan's (or even a KTA deli counter) on the banks of the Mon. Third, the \"house poke sauce\" is a reasonable facsimile of a classic shoyu poke dressing you might find in the 808 area code.  Nonetheless, my old friends back in Hilo and Waipahu would never call what they serve here \"poke\" -- whatever else it might be. Tasty (if ingredients are chosen with care)? Yes. Pretty good value? Yes. Reasonably healthy lunch alternative? Yes. But poke? Sorry, not even close.  Here are a few relatively cheap & easy suggestions for the management: (A) offer crunchy ogo seaweed as a topping -- with all the Asian restaurants and markets in the area, it's got to be readily available (daikon radish & kimchi would be welcome additions, too); (B) consider adding lomi lomi salmon (a simple chopped salmon salad with tomato, green & white onion, and salt) to the menu as a side dish (C) rethink the \"spicy tuna\" prep method, which currently reduces this noble fish to a pinkish-orange paste (is that really tuna?); (D) consider adding some daily specials to the fish line-up, along with the ahi (yellowfin) tuna and salmon -- like aku (skipjack) tuna, swordfish or tako (octopus); (E) pump in some Hawaiian music standards (e.g., Iz Kamakawiwo'ole, Gabby or Cyril Pahinui, Ka'au Crater Boys, Keola Beamer, etc.) to brighten up the spartan atmosphere and modulate the roar of the open cooler.  Congratulations on a brave effort to bring this glorious, fresh taste of the Pacific to dahntahn Pixburg, & `at. Here's hoping it's a little closer to the real thing on my next visit!",

If you keep that thought in your head, then this place is a fine option in the Downtown area. It's not amazing. It's not horrible. It's fine. The fish is fresh, and the options to build your own poke bowl are sufficient.   What keeps this place from being amazing is the fact that this isn't the poke you can find on the West Coast or the Hawaiian islands. If you've had poke in either of those places before and think this is what you're going to get, you'll be disappointed.

Even with the lower-priced option you get your choice of two proteins, and unlimited toppings come without an upcharge. Avocado in fact, is not extra.  My typical bowl starts with a salad base, shrimp and spicy tuna, and a mix of different toppings with a bit of spicy mayo and the poke sauce.

You pick a base of either white or brown rice (or the option of greens for a bowl), then you pick your protein, toppings, sauces and voila--a sushi bowl. I went for white rice, raw tuna and salmon, topped with a few veggies and a ginger vinaigrette sauce with some sesame seeds and it was delicious!   I had a bite of a sushi burrito and am definitely going to try that next time.

After receiving my bowl I was a little disappointed at the quantity of almost every ingredient. Compared to other poke places in Pittsburgh, who also serve high quality fish, this bowl came up short. The price was on par with most other local sushi places, but I could help but wish there was more protein for the price. The staff was very friendly even though they were very busy. Overall the flavor of the poke was ok aside from the few pieces of tuna I got which tasted old. I recommend you check out other poke places in Pittsburgh before this one.",

During both visits, staff behind the counter have been extremely helpful.  The assortment of toppings is fresh and tasty!  I got the double protein version of the bowl - first seared tuna and crab salad, then the raw tuna and salmon.  I added allllll the toppings and sauces.  There are endless combinations you can create, or you can order off of their menu where they've created some of their own.  Portions are generous for the price and you can choose 2-3 proteins and as many toppings/sauces as they have available.  This will become one of my dinnertime staples. Definitely a cool little place to check out!",

    "text": "Such an amazing addition to the downtown lunch scene. Service is fast, workers are so kind, and the food is fresh as can be. Only downfall is expect to spend about $12 on lunch. You have the option of ordering either a sushi burrito, or bowl. They have traditional sticky white rice, or you can sub sticky brown rice, quinoa, and I've also seen people building salads. They charge by either one protein or two, best to get two if you want the burrito or bowl to be fully loaded. The tofu is steamed and very fresh. The toppings are endless and they don't nitpick you by how many toppings, you can choose as many as you'd like. They have \"crunchy\" toppings as well, add-ons to make it spicy, and a variety of house-made sauces. Been here twice so far and it was fabulous both times. I prefer the bowl as I feel you get a more balanced meal with all the toppings/add-ins as opposed to the burrito. My friend liked the burrito better with the quinoa vs. the rice, as the rice was heavy/a lot and the add-ins get a little lost with all the rice. They also have some pre-made sushi in the fridge to grab and go, as well as several drinks. The tofu bowl is their vegan option and all their sauces (minus the eel) are vegan friendly. So, so delicious! I just think the tofu should be priced differently (cheaper) than all the raw fish.",

The reviews seemed to be promising too! I convinced my friend to go with me and it was super hard to find at first because it's so tiny, but I'm so glad I found it. It was not busy at all when I went, which is a bonus for me! I loved that they do have the create your own option or the house creations! It was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and ripe! My friend that went with me isn't big into this type of food, but she even enjoyed hers! The portions are great and no matter how many ingredient I asked for they didn't rip me off with the amount they put in. Definitely recommend checking this place out! Wish I lived in Pittsburgh so I could frequent it!",

For those that don't know what it is, the best way of describing it is a chipotle setup but with poke bowls/burritos. You walk in and you have the option of choosing one of their pre selected bowls/burritos or you have the option to build your own. You choose a base, protein, toppings, and sauce. I was a little hesitant, as I think most downtown employees were, because most residents before Pittsburgh Poke haven't always been the greatest establishments and they never last long. A lot of my coworkers have tried it since it's opening and all of them have agreed that it was very good and much better then they expected. I hope that means that Pittsburgh Poke will stick around a little longer then the previous tenants! I know I will definitely be going back many times because that house poke sauce is just so yummy!",

It's located on liberty avenue downtown right around the corner from market square which is pretty busy at lunchtime and it was about 12:00. So I see a spot open and head in this sketchy ass building meanwhile I'm keeping an open mind because the dive bars and little dirty looking restaurants often have really good food. I get inside and it's set up with all the ingredients looking like a jail cafeteria with inmates working lol but honestly it wasn't too bad. It was a nice price $11.95 for a bowl with spicy tuna, krab salad (with a k lol) and some toppings. Pretty basic flavors I would maybe go back if I was downtown close by but nothing I would travel for. I would rather have kahuna in east liberty or hidden harbor in squirrel hill. If I wasn't starving I probably wouldn't have finished it. I would have given 2.5 stars if I had the option but not 3",

I have yet to try the sushi burrito because I love the bowls so much, but it's on my list. For those that don't know what poke is, think Chipotle but with sushi.  I've gotten a few bowls from this place already, all have been really good and really fresh. I love that they have brown rice and quinoa as options as well, instead of just white rice. I normally order salmon, tuna, brown rice, with a bunch of veggies, and the citrus ponzu sauce. The citrus ponzu sauce is very fresh tasting, not too sweet. The bowls are a decent size.   The lines can get long during the lunch rush hour, but the past couple times I have gone the wait has been short. They also have premade to-go sushi, which I haven't tried yet but looks yummy. I consider the bowls to be a better value than sushi rolls, since they are more filling and you can customize them exactly how you want. They also have some pre-made recipe options for you to pick from.  Staff is super nice. Love this new addition to downtown Pittsburgh!",

It originally said it would be opening on June 23rd, but when I went last Friday, they changed the open date to June 26th. What caught my eye is that the main items they offer are sushi burritos and poke bowls! These are two things that are not really available to Pittsburgh at this current time, especially downtown! When I walked in, I was greeted by a man who handed me a menu. The place is small but roomy and there are a few tables for dining in. I walked up to the counter and it is basically set up like Chipotle, but with sushi ingredients. You have the option to make your own sushi burrito or poke bowl, or to order any 4 of their house burritos and bowls. I decided to make a poke bowl. You start with a base. I choose the half & half option of half white rice and half organic mixed greens. Then you can choose your protein. You can do two or three choices or do double or triple protein or one item. I chose salmon and spicy tuna. (Note:they offer both raw and cooked options -- they also offer tofu). Next, you can chose your mix-ins. They offer options like mango, avocado, jalepeno and cilantro. Then you choose your sauces-- options like house poke (it's a sweet vinegar) I tried it and it was delicious. Other sauce options are spicy mayo, eel sauce, sweet wasabi and ginger sesame. Lastly you can choose the flavorful toppings. Choices such as pickled ginger, masago, seaweed salad, and nori flakes. They carefully layered and packaged up my poke bowl. Everything is half off this week as it is their opening week.   My poke bowl was seriously amazing. They can take all of my money now! lol I will definitely be back sometime this week!  *note: they also offer pre packaged sushi and a small Thai hot foods bar. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and explained what everything was.  I am so happy that Pittsburgh Poke is here!",

I asked for a cup with ice, but they had no ice and only a limited variety of drinks. My wife noticed some black fragments of lettuce on the leaves that I thought was a really minor issue, but it and the general cheap ambiance pretty much turned her off. You really can build your own poke bowl from quite a number of ingredients for less than 13 dollars plus tax and the raw tuna and salmon was ample. We walked about 20 pleasant minutes from the Homewood Suites. Watch out for poor Google navigation--the address works better.",

They have a few house bowl and burrito options, but the appeal is the make your own.  Their menu has options without being completely overwhelming, which I appreciate.  The fish is fresh and tasty.  While maybe not the finest quality I have ever had, it is plenty good and fresh.

It used to be a different Asian restaurant (which was also good the last time I went), but the owner converted the place to become Pittsburgh Poke.  This was my first time trying poke, so I wasn't sure what to add in my bowl, but they have basic house bowl options for you to choose from that have great combinations. I got the house bowl 1, which was pretty filling but somewhat pricey. I thought it was one the best ways to eat sushi, especially because the flavors are more distinct, with bigger pieces of fish than in normal sushi.  It seemed like they were still getting things in order - AC was broken, decor was simple, etc. However, the workers were very friendly and took great care to make sure everything was clean (they changed their gloves in front of you).  Overall, I don't think I would go there regularly (price), but it's a delicious and great place to try out!",

I almost always choose two scoops of spicy tuna (but have also tried shrimp and crab).  You pick your base (brown or white rice, quinoa or lettuce) and then your main toppings.  There is a fairly large number of options available.  Some of my favorites are cucumber, avocado and mango.  You also choose your sauce (I get the poke sauce and ask for extra.  It is filled with flavor and has a little kick) and then pick your toppers (things like ginger, seaweed salad, sesame seeds and edamame).  The whole process takes less then five minutes and you have a tasty, fresh and customized meal.  I find them to be filling and satisfying. The staff speaks limited English, but they know enough to walk you through your order. If you are downtown Pittsburgh I highly recommend giving them a try.",

    "text": "I was excited to try a new poke place in Pittsburgh especially seeing the good reviews on Yelp. At first I wasn't sure about this place because of the store front looks really run down and old. However, after eating their food I'm sure I will come back here again. The portion was large and all the vegetables are fresh. I got a customized poke bowl, my friend got a sushi burrito. We both enjoyed it very much. I got a spicy tuna and spicy crab rice bowl with jalapeno, cucumber, and mango in there. Ooh it was so fulfilling and delicious. The rice bowl was $10.99 with two proteins. If you want two proteins, it's $12.99.  The food and the price is definitely a 'hell yes' for me. It would definitely be a five stars if they improve their store to give a more welcoming vibe. Maybe more lighting and nicer set up? The service was so great and everyone was so friendly.  I love this place! If you're curious about this place, don't hesitate it, I highly recommended it.",

    "text": "The track record of restaurants in this space have not been good.  It's an awkward front on an extremely busy intersection that has devoured attempts at peruvian chicken, sushi, and thai.  The only constant seems to have been vacancy similar to it's old neighboring Wendy's or the ability to purchase a happy meal with a crack / heroin / pill surprise at the adjacent McDonald's.  Needless to say, there is a lot working against anyone trying to establish a respectable business here.  Fortunately one way to make a name for yourself is to provide consistent quality and great tasting food, both of which have been the case throughout three separate visits since opening. I have not had the pleasure of experiencing authentic poke on any of the Hawaiian islands, nor the pacific coast, so perhaps any following commentary is off base in that regard.  What I can say is that the food is fresh, the options are plentiful and mindful, and the service and process are relatively quick.  Having played with a few combinations on previous trips, I was able to approach lunch with a more cohesive game plan that culminated in a very flavorful and satisfying result.  A sticky white rice base, half portions of spicy and seared tuna, avocado, cucumber, jalapeno, cilantro, scallion, shaved red cabbage, pickled daikon, crispy onions, toasted sesame, chili flake, spicy mayo, house poke sauce, pickled ginger, and seaweed salad.  Unfortunately the spicy tuna doesn't seem to be much more than a coating of sriracha, currently the world's most overhyped condiment, but it was enough flavor to balance the freshness and slightly tart pickle of the other elements.  This approach yielded a very successful textural contrast and a great harmony of flavors.  This is still a new business and there are a few kinks to work out, particularly the lack of AC supplemented by a couple industrial fans blowing in the direction of the queue (not a great mental image, being a concept that primarily serves raw fish that is nowhere near the waters they originated), but it's close.  Poke is a great option in the Market Square food landscape that provides great quality similar to it's rolled counterpart two blocks over at Number 1 Sushi. Pittsburgh may not be synonymous with Hawaiian cuisine, but if the simplistic nature is maintained and the product remains fresh, there is no reason why this can't start to turn that particular corner of downtown.",

It's very casual; drinks are in a cooler and flatware is all plastic.

    "text": "Poke finally comes to Pittsburgh ... a trend that seems to be hitting most U.S. cities like no other (not sure why). Anyways, came here as this was new at the time. Here are my impressions.  Decor/Ambiance: Interior is rather unimpressive. Essentially with some tables/chairs for seating, a condiments/sauce bar, and the ordering register/checkout area where you can order & add your extras. Reminds me of cafeteria-like set up, which I don't mind.  Food: Quite yummy. You can either create your own poke bowl or sushi burrito, choose your bases (quinoa +$1), proteins (2 - $10.99, 3 - $12.99), mix-ins, sauces, and toppings. There are also presets if you're too lazy to do so. Food here is great. Seafood used is fresh, mix-ins are fresh & diverse (love the variety), and sauces & toppings as well in regards to variety. Love the diverse customization you can do here with your order & at a most reasonable price as price points are relatively cheap compared to poke joints I've been to in other cities.  Overall, a most worthy poke joint to visit in order to satisfy your poke craving. Just be warned that parking can be a bit of a pain since it is downtown & meter maids are much more viligant about enforcing the limited street parking around this area.",

I mean, fluorescent yellow paint is not exactly an appetizing color. However, once you get past the not-so-appealing exterior, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  For anyone who doesn't know what poke is, basically, it's sushi in bowl form. If raw fish freaks you out, they serve chicken and tofu as well. The process is similar to a Chipotle setup where you choose your base, protein, and toppings as you go through the line. My usual bowl comes with the salad base, tofu, and literally every topping they have available (toppings are free!). Combine it with the spicy mayo and it is heaaaven. The line usually reaches the door during lunchtime, but they get everyone through at a fairly quick pace.  My only complaint would be the price point which is a bit high for fast casual and the portion size you get. A two protein bowl is $10.99 and a three protein bowl is $12.99.Perhaps it's my monstrous appetite or my black hole of a stomach, but I'm never exactly full whenever I finish my bowl. There are definitely better deals out there if you're in it for the quantity.",

    "text": "Coming to Pittsburgh from the west coast, I was hesitant when I first saw Pittsburgh Poke. It's in a very unassuming location by Market Square with just small signage in the windows and a banner above the door. Their prices are also humble and initially made me question whether the food would be any good. But I was completely wrong. I judged a book by its cover.   Pittsburgh Poke offers delicious fresh fish bowls (or burritos) with great chipotle like options for filling your bowl. These include free options such avocado, sriracha mayo, and cucumbers and a couple premium ones like salmon roe. Their prices are unbelievable considering the quality of the food. They don't skimp on portions either, I'm a big eater and getting three portions of fish (only $13) is enough for me to feel full.  TLDR: Fresh fish, great choices for filling your bowl, and unbeatable prices make Pittsburgh Poke an easy choice for lunch or a casual dinner downtown. Don't make the same mistake I did and judge it by it's exterior.",

    "text": "On the outside it doesn't look like much and I probably would have walked right past it if it wasn't for all the hype. Prior to trying Pittsburgh Poke, I had a poke bowl from Tako ($14). Was it delicious? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. Takos bowl doesn't compare to the nice sized bowl Pittsburgh Poke gives you. Tako also doesn't have as many options as Pittsburgh Poke and options are what everyone wants.  Let's talk about the options Pittsburgh Poke has to offer. There are 9 protein options (choose 2 $10.99 or choose 3 $12.99).  There are 12 mix-in options and you can go all in with these because they are unlimited. There are 7 sauce options and 12 topping options. If you are an avocado fan, they're not going to charge you extra like most places do (cough cough Tako).   Since they opened in June I have came here 3 times. The first time I decided to build my own burrito. I kept it pretty simple - brown rice, avocado, mango, shrimp, spicy mayo and house poke sauce (on the sweet side). These burritos like the bowls are VERY filling. The other 2 times I wanted to build a bowl and this is when I decided to get creative. For the first bowl I went with brown rice, shrimp & kani salad (crab), cucumber, carrots, avocado, red cabbage, blanched kale, house poke, spicy mayo, sesame seeds & seaweed salad. The second bowl I went with brown rice, shrimp & seared tuna, cucumber, mango, red cabbage, avocado, carrots, house poke, spicy mayo, seaweed salad & sesame seeds. I also really like that they let you sample something before you make your selection. I was unsure of the seared tuna at first, but they are nice enough to let you try it before committing.   If you are looking for a sit down place to have lunch, this might not be the place for you due to very little seating. It is definitely perfect for on the go though!",

Their white rice base is AMAZING!  I also loved their sauces. After sampling their sauces, it was difficult to choose. So I will be returning to try more base+protein+topping+sauce combinations!",

You would normally get a single sushi roll for $11 and this burrito is more food than a single roll.   I got a side of the seaweed salad to try. It was a nice side for the burrito.   I highly recommend going. I will definitely be back when I'm in town.",

I got salmon in the first place because the tuna looked grey and dull and sad, probably old.   The good: really good sauces and toppings.  Decent rice.   However, I can't give more than 1 star because the defining element of poke is the fish, and the fish here was by far the worst I've had out of dozens of poke places. I got my bowl to-go because I had to catch a bus, and wasn't able to go back to the restaurant by the time I had found the frozen fish. Disappointed and won't be coming back.",

Not the nicest of storefronts, inside is cleaner but not beautiful. They definitely need to crank up the A/C in warm, humid July days.  The Sushi Burrito making process is simple. Pick your rice, proteins, veggies, sauces and other extras. Roll it up and enjoy.  I went with white rice with Shrimp and Spicy Tuna. Added only green onions and celery along with Spicy mayo. Finally added some tempura and wasabi/ginger on the side.  Basically, it's Sushi in Burrito form. Very good and filling.  The Sushi Poke bowls seem to be a big seller and there was always a line while I was there, but the wait is not long.  Looking forward to my next visit already!",

    "text": "This is one my favorite places to get lunch in downtown Pittsburgh. I love burritos - I love sushi - so unsurprisingly, I love the sushi burritos here! I admittedly haven't been able to break my burrito addiction and order any actual poke bowls yet. Soon though!  This eatery may look plain and simple, but don't let that appearance fool you or scare you off. This place is home to some quality food, as well as very good staff who can keep a line moving and make you smile with their delicious creations. Although, I guess it's really YOUR creations, since you can pick what goes in your burrito or bowl!  Currently I usually order one of the pre-set menu options because it's a great combination (Spicy tuna, salmon, cucumber, avocado, spicy mayo wrapped in sushi rice, sesame seeds and nori.). But for those of you who want something more: the sushi burritos work the same as their poke bowls. You can choose a base (rice, greens, quinoa, or half & half), two or three proteins, plus your mix-ins and sauces. The staff will put your order together similar to a Chipotle ordering line, and you'll be ready to dine!  As others have mentioned, this place is small, so it's best to come early or to be ready to carry your food out to eat elsewhere. And if you're totally new to the poke/sushi burrito game, their four pre-set menu options can help you get familiar with the process and the flavors you can combine. So go forth and create your meals, my friends - and enjoy!",

The first thing I noticed was the topping bar- everything was fresh and looked wonderful. I came here to try the sushi burrito...a trendy food that I've been wanting to try FOREVER. In my sushi burrito, I added salmon, spicy tuna, kale, cabbage, cucumber, avocado, seaweed salad, salmon roe, jalapeno, carrot, and spicy mayo. My sister and aunt built their own poke bowls, which looked great.  The next thing I noticed was the presentation of the food. Not to brag, but my sushi burrito was aesthetic, picture-worthy, and beautiful. I wanted to take pics before I devoured it!!   When I took a bite into the sushi burrito, it felt like heaven touched my tastebuds. It was PHENOMENAL. This proves that the sushi burrito trend is a success, I'll definitely eat sushi burritos again. One of my new fave foods now.   The place is clean, food is fresh, staff is kind, everything was fantastic. No complaints here. I'll be back to Pittsburgh Poke soon!!",

You start with your base. You can either get a bowl or burrito style. I decided to get my base with half brown rice and half lettuce. You can choose as many meats as you want. I did spicy tuna and salmon. There's also tons of toppings to choose from. They don't charge you extra for avocado and they give you such a generous amount of seafood and toppings. You can choose as many as you want and the portions are abundant. For the price, which I think I paid about $13, it was so worth it. It was a heavy bowl full of deliciousness. The customer service was great, the price was reasonable, the food was delicious, and I didn't even have to wait in line. Located in the center of downtown Pittsburgh near market Square, Pittsburgh Poke definitely a thumbs up.",

    "text": "Love love love!  I finally got to check out Pittsburgh Poke last night. Have you ever been to Chipotle?  Or Hello Bistro?  You essentially \"design\" what you eat...meet - Pittsburgh Poke  First start is a base - brown or white rice, quinoa (+$1), salad or half/half.  I went brown rice and quinoa.  (I personally love quinoa in my salads - so I bet it would be a great half/half with lettuce too!)  Side note: Doing the half/half gets you around the extra $1 for quinoa too!  Second stop - meat!  You get 2 choices for the $10.99 option.  Personally - that was PLENTY.  I chose to get 2 scoops of salmon - but they have alll kinds of choices (Salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, chicken, etc).    Third stop is mix ins - avocado, cucumber, carrot, etc.  They have a TON of great mix ins.  It seems that you could pick as many as you wanted.   Fourth - toppings/dressing - I got the ginger sesame.  I added some soy sauce as they don't give you a ton of sauce - so the little bit of extra soy sauce was helpful.  The only downfall was the air conditioner was broken.  You would think - raw fish...no air...should I be nervous?  Nope!  Their fish is fresh, phenomenal and tasty.  We didn't eat on site because of the air problem - but still quick service, phenomenal food, and quick and easy to go - all for $12 (a little more with tip!)    The only thing - I wish they were open a little later on week nights.  I get that lunch is their BIG crowd (understandably!)  But maybe on sport event nights and/or show nights - stay open a bit later than 7.  It's hard to get down there sometimes.  I definitely can not wait to go back.  Maybe a burrito next time.  It was SO good.",

Never did I ever think that there would be something like that here in Pittsburgh!  This spot is definitely legit! They have so many different seafood options including tuna, salmon, shrimp, roe, spicy tuna...and it's all very fresh. You can choose several different options for your bowl. They have white and brown rice, quinoa, or a field greens base. Then you add all of the toppings that you want. Choose your Seafood choose all sorts of veggies, and different toppings like seaweed salad, sliced jalapenos, mangos, masago, etc. Top it all off with one of their house made poke sauces. Also be sure to get some of the spicy mayo on the side or drizzled on the top of your bowl.  I also believe that they're going to have hot bowls in the near future. I believe something along the lines of Korean bibimbap. I can't wait to try that!  I don't get downtown too often, but when I do this is I stopped I always make.",

I should also mention: don't let the long line dissuade you. The folks behind the counter move really quickly.",

    "text": "My prayers have been answered! I thought only \"trendy\" cliche cities like NYC or LA would have poke bowl/sushi burrito places, but when I found out that this little hole in the wall existed, right in the center of downtown PGH, and a mere 800 ft from my apartment, I was jumping with joy! The establishment isn't anything fancy, just a grab-n-go place set up like a Subway or Chipotle.   First, you choose your base- white rice/brown rice/quinoa/mixed greens, then pick your protein-seared or spicy tuna, salmon, seared salmon, tofu or chicken, then veggies, sauces and toppings. Overall, extremely filling! A great post workout meal with all the protein.   I've only been there twice, but my favorite is the salmon and seared tuna with quinoa/mixed greens base, with cucumber, red cabbage, mango, cilantro, avocado, red onion, seaweed salad, fried onions, house spicy miso with spicy mayo and nori flakes. Have yet to try the sushi burrito but will save that for a day I can afford to binge on carbs ;).   I suggested that they start a frequent customer punchcard for those who eat here frequently (like I know I will be!). Hopefully they do something like that soon, with it being $12-$13 a bowl.   Thanks Pittsburgh Poke, for existing!",

I was so pleased to walk in and be greeted by an extremely friendly staff. They were knowledgeable and happy to explain the way the restaurant works. It is essentially a big food bar where you can choose your base for the bowl (quinoa, brown rice, mixed greens among the options) up to three proteins, and an unlimited number of fix-ins and sauces. I chose tuna and salmon with a healthy number of fix-ins and the sweet wasabi sauce. It was fresh and so delicious- exactly what I was hoping for! And when I got to the register the huge bowl was only $5. They were running a half off special for opening week and it was truly a steal. I will absolutely be back to try more combinations and the location is perhaps dangerously close to my work place... oh well! Well done Pittsburgh Poke!",

I personally find the portion size to be perfect for lunch; I was not over-full but I didn't get hungry again before 5 either. I got a base of \"half and half\" (you pick two) mixed organic greens and brown rice, salmon and tuna as my protein, and loaded it up with avocado (no up-charge (!)), green onions, radishes, cucumber, crunchy (fried) onion bits, masago, and nori flakes. There are so many sauces but one of the workers behind the counter kindly walked me through all of them and offered to put the house poke on the side for me because I didn't want to make my bowl over-sweet (I am a salt monster). He gave me spicy mayo on the side, too. The combo was heavenly but I will continue to get the poke sauce on the side, since it is quite sweet and I added only about a fourth of what I think they would put on directly. At half-off my bowl rang in at $5.88, so it will be almost $12 next week and onward, but I loved it so much I'll still be back often.",

The owner refused to serve me saying I was already sick and he would not let me order food. I tried to explain I hadn't eaten which is what caused me to get sick and I was trying to get it to go. The owner still refused and told me to leave. I told him I would not be back and he said, fine, he did not care. I am a diligent customer, eating there on a weekly basis. I can't understand why he would be so rude to me? I have even referred other people to eat there. I cannot give my money to someone who would be so rude and disrespectful.

It tasted super good and I was very happy about giving this place a try especially when it was half off! What could go wrong with that right?!

Though I think it's more a 3.5 out of 5 than a 3, I. Can't give it a 4, because of the portion size in relation to price.",

There are so many add in options that you can get a different bowl with different flavors every time.  I like tuna, salmon, seaweed, roe, edamame.  No limits on toppings.   New favorite lunch spot downtown.  I hope this place survives.",

    "text": "We have a Slack channel at the office called #hungry - and it was buzzing when this place opened.  I finally got the chance to try it, and it was even better than I had hoped.  It's really an assembly line of build-your-own (yes, like Chipotle).  The tuna tasted very fresh and was being brought out every few minutes from the back, seemingly cut in smaller batches as needed to avoid having a bunch sitting out at once.  Toppings were nicely diverse and delicious - a nice heap of scallions, avocado, edamame, and even wakame salad, which was awesome.  I'm going to have to go back to try some different combinations and sauces.  If I had one adjustment - the rice was a bit heavily seasoned with vinegar and sugar - but that won't stop me from going back quite a few times.",

    "text": "Very very good and reasonably priced for amount and quality of the food. I got a poke bowl with two proteins + a plethora of toppings. There was A LOT of fish, and the ratio of rice to fish to toppings was perfect. All of the ingredients looked and tasted as fresh as it gets. I can't speak firsthand about the physical location or service because a friend picked it up, but he said that his experience was excellent. Employees were continually bringing out fresh fish and ingredients while he was there, so it was apparent that everything didn't just sit there in a heap all day.   Will return and recommend!",
