    "text": "Today I went to pick up a take out!  I walked in and  I was greeted with a super sweet young server. Ashley, a manager took my order over the phone. I pay, I  question my order because it seemed kind of high. The server repeated the order which was completely wrong. It was a pizza when I ordered a salad. The server quickly went into the kitchen to get my salad started. She then went  over to Ashley and told her the issue. The MANAGER ASHLEY then quickly got rude and loud basically calling me a liar saying I ordered a pizza. I know what i ordered. (because what I ordered today is what they forgot in my order last week and I've been having a taste for it since last week.) She then (with a nasty attitude) tells the server to reorder the item. The girl came back me and assured me its not my fault. At this point I am uncomfortable and angry. Ask the server to make sure my card is not charged twice (which there are currently 2 transactions pending on my card holding  funds)The manager Ashley again yells at server \"I told you to reorder it!\" The server explains she swiped my card for first transaction. Ashley says it was never charged. Again very rude! to both me and the  server. A manager, to talk to employees like this in front of guests is beyond wrong and very bad for business. Her attitude and demeanor were out of control. This young server was mortified by the way Ashley spoke with me and her!!!!",

I was with an older woman (mid-70's) who had a very hard time hearing the conversation.      Food: My party was observing lent.    We ordered the Egg Plant appetizer, Sweet Pepper Pizza, and the Cheese Calzone. Each had decent flavor but nothing to take it to the next level of other wood or coal fire pizzerias I have visited.      Please note that the pizza are \"well done\" which I prefer (crust must pass the stand test - ie. No floppy slices).    The oils from the cheese still made my pizza soggy.  Service: Our service was great.   The waitress was very attentive and kept our refreshments filled.  Price: Pretty Expensive - You are not at ... Pick your Chain here...   Overall - I really don't think I will go out of my way to visit this place but if it is convenient or other folks want to go then I will give it another try.",

Also, if you like wings then definitely try their baked wings. They bake them in a cast iron pan with onions and they are heavenly. I'm not a big onion person but they are so yummy and seasoned perfectly with the wings.   I highly recommend this location or the Cranberry location. They both are fantastic.",

My only tip - avoid the long finger hot peppers unless you can eat your Thai food at a 10. My husband and I are both fans of spicy/hot, but these peppers had us gulping down a pitcher of water after one slice. Oh and they don't have ranch, which is just... odd. Pizza + ranch = perfection. I still like it sans ranch though, so that's saying something.",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick bite to eat on a weekday before catching a movie. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, so we finally did!  First off, the hostesses were very unprofessional, laughing and goofing off in front of customers. When we walked in, they were gossiping with one another and I had interrupt them to get seated, even though they clearly saw us come in.   We had a nice table off to the side, and got a nice view of the restaurant. The space itself is kind of weird, like one big square room. Not the best ambiance. Boy, was it loud in there! The music was blasting and it was hard for us to hear one another. It was late and I understand it was in the midst of changing from a family restaurant to a bar scene, but still the loudness was a little too much for us.   Our server, Nathan, was extremely friendly. He was attentive, quick, and always there when we needed him. Best service I have received in a long time!   Tom ordered a craft beer and I got a Diet Coke. They bring the soft drinks out in bottles, which I'm sure saves them money, but I think is rude. No free refills allowed... so I drank very slowly. We ordered a white pizza and split it. The pizza was pretty good with very fresh ingredients, but not good enough for the price. Also, their pizza is \"well done\" in a coal fired oven, which means that the crust is crispy, burnt, and there is black coal dust all over the bottom of the pizza. Not completely appetizing if you ask me... I will stick to brick ovens and wood-fired!  Overall, decent pizza for too much money. Service made up for it. Go for lunch when it's not so loud.",

With that said, they have a unique product so I understand it being a little expensive but in my mind their prices are a little too high.    I will say that the wings are unique and so good that I come back again and again, in spite of the price.  The Cheesesteak Pizza is melt in your mouth good.  I've had several of the other pizzas and really liked them as well.  The toppings seem fairly high quality in general.  As for the people who have complained about dark crust.... Read the walls, that is sort of their thing!  If you order the right things the food is unique and tasty enough that I have to give this place 5 start in spite of the price.

We sat on the patio because it was a beautiful day, but because the patio is right next to the main road in to the plaza, there was a lot of traffic noise.   Drinks are the downfall though and the reason I couldn't rate 5-stars. All of the soft drinks (including iced tea) are Coke products in bottles at $2.99 each. No one at our table bought from the bar so I can't comment on that.   Overall, a pleasant experience with good food and amazing wings.",

The cheesecake is probably the best plain cheesecake I've ever had, I would definitely get it.",

Young servers who seemed like genuinely nice people.  Good draft beer selection.  Cons  Expensive for pizza.  A small one topping was 15.99. Not that big. My self and my 4.5 yo ate it all and we're both hungry. Keep in mind I normally eat a max of 3 pieces and I'm stuffed of a heartier pizza.   Dough was neutral. A papery taste  Salad was expensive for a side salad too. $6 and change. Plus $2.99 for added cheese.  Server said it was good for 2 people but it's just a regular size salad  Overall I would come back for sure. But not in my regular rotation. Once a year or so.   Pizza was a thinner crust. Not thinnest but not normal pizza thickness. I prefer a heartier pizza.",

    "text": "A new pizza place opened in Monroeville?  Sure, I'll give it a try.  I do love pizza after all.  Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza is located in Monroeville, PA.  If you're familiar with the area, it's in the same shopping center as Starbucks, PNC, and DSW.  We arrived at 7:30 PM on Tuesday.  To our surprise, the large restaurant was full.  That's OK, we were willing to wait.  After 15 minutes, we were seated at a small table in the bar area.  As I looked over the menu, I checked out the decor.  Anthony's furnishings are plain and tasteful.  The tables are all wood, and the walls are decorated with understated sports memorabilia.  Besides framed jerseys and other football periodicals, the interior design is traditional and tasteful.  While looking over the menu, we decided to wet our palates with white sangria, and munch on some salad.  Anthony's offers a Classic Italian Salad ($9.50).  That sounds like a lot for a diner salad, but it's meant for at least two people to share.  The romaine and iceberg lettuce were crispy and fresh.  The salad was topped with hard-boiled eggs, tomato wedges, red onions, and was dressed with tangy and flavorful house Italian vinaigrette.  The white sangria was sweet and fragrant.  Small pieces of apple and melon garnished the drink.  Our large pie ($15.25) arrived as we were finishing our salad.  We opted for a veggie-style pizza with sweet peppers, onions,  Kalamata olives, and Arugula. Traditional pies consist of mozzarella, Italian plum tomatoes, Romano cheese, basil and olive oil.  Our pie was laughably HUGE- it was probably the enormous mound of fresh arugula that sat atop the pie that made it seem so overwhelming.  As I scooped the first slice of pie for my dinner companion, a server approached our table and said, \"Wow that was a fail... were supposed to serve the first piece sir, then you can do the rest...\"  What?  Did this server really just question my pizza-serving skills?  I think so!  Apparently I didn't get enough of the toppings that lay beneath the mountain of arugula.    The pie was steaming hot.  The crust was thin and crispy.  All of the toppings were delicious.  We enjoyed every bite, and could only have a few pieces each; they were quite large.  If you're not in the mood for pizza, Anthony's offers Coal Oven Roasted Wings (small, 10 pieces for $9.50, large, 20 pieces for $16.95).  Other dishes include Pork Ribs with Vinegar Peppers (small- 6 ribs for $10.95,large-12 ribs for $17.95), Meatballs with Ricotta Cheese ($10.95), Eggplant Marino ($10.95), and Broccoli Rabe and Sausage ($11.95).  Lunch specials are also offered.  I had never had coal-fired pizza before.  Initially I thought a flavor component may be missing that wood-fired pizza ovens provide.   I was wrong.  Not only are the pizzas at Anthony's delicious, the charred crusts and toppings are fresh and abundant.    If you consider yourself a pizza aficionado, put Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza at the top of your list.",

    "text": "Totally underwhelming, on every front.   My fiance and I had been wanting to try this place for a while. We live quite close, and drive past every time we go to a movie or to the grocery store. So tonight we finally had a chance to stop in and get some pizza.   The first thing I noticed is the attempt at an \"upscale atmosphere\" pizza joint. I kind of hated it. A nice looking bar, tarnished by a bunch of pizza joint style table seating (four tops mostly, and one long booth that has chairs on the opposite side). Nice decor on the walls, nice music, silverware and quality condiment shakers on the table... But the plastic plates and bottled soda is the opposite of everything this pizza place is trying to be.   I personally thought the menu lacked variety. There are only a few selections of \"specialty\" pizza, and I wasn't really wowed by any of them. Nothing really stood out to me. Sure, you can customize a pizza... at $3/topping on your $18 pizza.   First we ordered the wings. I didn't like them at all. They tasted like any old chicken wings baked in the oven with black pepper, rosemary, and the faintest hint of garlic. Kind of bland, except when I got a little spring of rosemary in a bite, and then it would be overpowering.   We ended up ordering one pie with half mushroom and pepperoni (can't screw that up), the other half with tomato, mushroom and onion. It was okay. I'd give it a 5/10. The crust was...okay. Nice and crisp, but nothing special. The sauce was barely there, and tasteless. The mushroom and pepperoni were the best part, but isn't that typical of just about any pizza? The tomato and mushroom were fresh, which was great. I absolutely HATE places that use jar/canned mushrooms. So, kudos on that at least. The onions were supposed to be caramelized. They weren't... they were just sauteed, in olive oil I think. Most people probably don't notice the difference though.   We also ordered a white pizza, which we added tomato to. Thankfully we did, because, again, it was pretty bland. No garlic, and I had a difficult time tasting the ricotta. It was dry. Again, nothing special. The tomato added a little more moisture and flavor.   For the cost, its totally not worth it. We spent over $60 (not including tip)... and for that you get plastic plates and soda served in a plastic bottle. No thanks, I'll stick with the neighborhood pizza places, or the Hop House.",

    "text": "So I'll say this...I really like pizza.  I like pizza about every way that it can be made.  But one thing I don't care for is chain pizza establishments.  Don't get me wrong, I won't turn it down.  But I much more prefer independently owned and operated.  However, in the case of Anthony's, this is about as good as a chain gets.    We have been here about five times, and have had quality food on a consistent basis.  When you first walk into the restaurant there is typically a hostess directly inside that opens the door and greets you.  Nice touch.  I've never had to wait for a table, but it has always been fairly busy.    Start off with the wings.  If you've never had the wings before ask the server and they will give you a sampling of two.  The wings are wood fired and have a rosemary dry seasoning on them, then topped with caramelized onions.  FANTASTIC!    As far as pizza, I have tried the margherita, the paul and young ron, and your basic peperoni.  I loved them all.  They give you balsamic and olive oil, and I suggest dipping your crust in either.  YUM!  The crust is always just slightly blackened on the edges, which I love.  The margherita has no sauce with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil.  The paul and ron young has peppers, meatballs, sausage, and ricotta.   The service has always been friendly and accommodating.    They seem to have some good beer, although I've never drank there.  The soft drinks and tea comes bottled.  So no free refills.  But who cares, its a quality product.    The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the food came out kinda quick.  I wanted just a little more time to eat my wings.  And this happens because the oven cooks the food quick.  So this is just a timing problem.  All and all, good food, nice people, a bit pricey, but the product is worth it in my opinion.",

    "text": "I did takeout, and as they have curbside pickup (very convenient), I did not see the inside of the establishment, though I get the impression it is on the classier side of pizza restaurants.  Onto the food.  I ordered something basic - I think sausage and onion.  It was cooked perfectly and had that smokey flavor you'd expect from a coal fired pizza.  The dough is pretty thin and the crust is more of that flaky, air filled crust.  Good stuff.  Now - the wings were unbelievable.  The are baked in the coal fired oven, then covered in carmelized onions and topped with a piece of brioche.  The seasoning is out of this world - not even sure what to call it - tuscan maybe?  Best wings I've had in a while.  However, if you are looking for flavor options you might be disappointed because they only have the one option, but like I said they were phenomenal.  My one complaint, and the reason behind my 3 star rating, is the price.  This was takeout, mind you, and on that pizza and wings I spent 40 dollars, then tipped the girl 5.  So 45 dollars for a pizza dinner... that's a bit much.  But that seems to be in line with the more upscale approach this company takes to their presentation/environment.  I will be returning, but maybe just for an order of the wings - as good as it was, I don't need to be spending that kind of money on pizza.  Cheers, Rob",

I ordered the roasted cauliflower pizza. The cauli was roasted to a crisp and I really liked the Parmesan cheese on top. An individual size pizza was plenty for a lunch portion too.  I also ordered a Bloody Mary since it was on special (I can't help myself). It wasn't horrible, but kinda boring.   The service was incredibly friendly. I just wish they weren't blasting the AC, as I was felt like I needed a parka to eat inside in August. I'll take my pizza parka free, thanks!",

There seems to always be a wait on the weekends here too, so make sure to give yourself time if you are extra hungry!   All of their pizzas are coal fired which gives them a unique flavor different from typical pizza places. I prefer the brick oven more (a la Il Pizzialo) but it's always nice to switch up your pizza! I have tried a few different pizzas here including the white pizza, roasted cauliflower pizza, and the meatballs and ricotta pizza. All of the pizzas that I tried were great and different from pizza I have ordered at other restaurants. They also have coal fired wings that everybody raves about- I'm always too full to have any! The prices are alittle high at Anthony's but it's a great place for a meal while in Settler's Ridge.",

The crust is a tad thin on their pizzas, which a fair amount of my friends complain about.  I don't mind it though.  I think it goes with the various toppings they offer.  At the Settler's Ridge location, our server was spot on, and very attentive.  The craft beer selection was pretty decent too, which actually surprised me a bit.  There were at least 10 on tap.  Even though this isn't the top pizza joint in the Pittsburgh area (c'mon - that's too tall an order for a chain joint to fill), its a good place to stop for some unique topping choices, and oven fired pizza.",

Being 100% Italian I had to share my thoughts about this terrible experience.  On a positive note, the salad was good.",

This place is just OK when it comes to pizza. All pizzas are cooked in a coal oven and taste very good, if you like that kind of pizza. The bar area is also good, however it is a little pricey. BUT, if you are looking to go somewhere for an evening that is nice and has good drink deals and slashed prices on food - THIS is the place to go. they have great deals during weekdays and weekends for drinks - not just beers, but sometimes bloody Mary's and other times, spirits. I recommend THAT.   Overall, I wouldn't skip it but I'm not in love with it. Best of luck in choosing.",

I'm also not one for chains, but I was thoroughly impressed with this place.  The service was great and they even greeted us by opening the door as we walked in.  We were seating right away and served very quickly.  My dad and I decided to split the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza and we were both extremely satifisied.  The carmalizeed onions made the pizza have that much more flavor and it filled us up just right.  I ordered two drinks along side my meal and my father orded one.

Their service and kitchen are both FAST, and the pizzas that I get here are always high quality. It's an intimate little place, and you can watch dinner being made in their oven pizzas if you get a good spot.  Anthony's also plays to their strengths very well, in that they offer a focused menu that's based around a handful of key ingredients that can be made into pizza, sandwiches and so forth; I admittedly always get their pizza. A focused menu means that while its list of options is smaller than some places, the ingredients are generally as fresh as possible, and it enhances the quality of dinner all around.  Mostly recently during my visits I've sampled their meatball and ricotta pizza, as well as their eggplant pizza. Let me tell you, that eggplant pizza is the best I've ever stumbled on. I've found many bad eggplant dishes out there, so the fact that they managed to perfectly cook theirs and layer it on top of fresh dough and sauce and cheese...I was impressed. Kudos to the cooks. Giant glasses of sangria always complete my meals here - they're the (sometimes literal) cherry on top of a fresh and flavorful night out.   I'm very excited to come here again in the future, especially after the menu switches up again, as there are a lot of flavor combinations being mentioned in other reviews that they don't have at the moment. But in the meantime, I know those meatballs and those eggplant dishes won't disappoint!",

Our waiter went the extra mile and served our pizza slices and put them in a box for us after. We are from AZ and that's not a normal thing. The beer and wine was also excellent. First meal in Pennsylvania and off to a good start!",

    "text": "Parents took me here while I was home for Labor Day. We walked right in on a Saturday evening, no wait. Place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open.   We got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. I was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. I was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sauteed onions, but wow were they good. Seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. Tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. I wish I had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with It (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came.)  The pizza was also quite good. I loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza. My only complaint, and I know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt. The bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened. I think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out. But I'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!",

Also got a small classic Italian salad - enough to share with cool, crisp lettuce - could've eased up a little on the dressing but tasty.  Our small square margarita pizza was also good too.  Love the fresh basil.  Nice size - enough to feel full and pack some away for a lunch tomorrow.  Overall this was a solid meal - our server was great.

    "text": "Middle of the road for me - perhaps a 3.5  I'd go back and probably enjoy it, but it wouldn't be a go-to pick.   We came on a Friday night and were seated right away - yay for that!   Our server came by quickly to take a drink order, but then took a pretty long time to come back with it.   We ordered the Paulie's pie (half sweet and half hot pepper's) and the rib appetizer.  The ribs were really good - tender and flavorful - fall off the bone.    The pizza was a mixed bag.  I really enjoyed my sweet pepper half, except for the crust, which was much too charred (black and crumbly)for my taste.  Bummer, cause I like to eat the crust.  The boyfriend suffered though.  The server should have issued a warning on those hot peppers because my orders-spice-level-8/10-at-a-Thai-place boyfriend thought they were too spicy to eat.   He picked them off the last slice, but by then, the damage was done.    Which brings me back to the overall service.   Our server was very friendly, but clearly a little frazzled.  The first round of drinks was slow, so we ordered round 2 when he dropped them.  The ribs were served without plates, silver, or napkins (the manager rectified that).   Round 2 of drinks also took forever, but he did pick it up with Round 3.  About halfway through, we did notice that he had a big family with a ton of kids in the adjoining room that was very high-maintenance and monopolizing his time.  I kind of felt back for him after that.  The pizza was dropped by a runner, who didn't tell us how to distinguish between the sweet and hot side.  Fortunately, we guessed right, as those hot peppers would have ruined my day.    At the end of the day, it's a chain and it feels like a chain.   I can give then a pass on the service since I saw the reason that happened and I saw the manager trying to help out.   But the blackened crust isn't my favorite and I was longing for a few more appetizer choices.",

To start, the atmosphere was nice, we sat in an open air section kind of like a covered patio that had a few twinkle lights.  It was a quiet place, perfect for our Sunday night dinner.  We started our dinner with Anthony's Classic Italian Salad.  The small salad was perfect to split for two and the dressing was really tangy and delicious.  My only complaint about the salad was that they charged us to add cheese to the salad....they charged us $2.99 for like the tiniest little cup of mozzarella cheese ever!   The pizza seemed kind of expensive too and of course when I tried to check the menu for prices online they weren't listed on their website.  I think it was around $20 for the large pizza and more if you wanted additional toppings.  We got a half pepperoni. half arugula pizza and both were pretty good.  The pizza is on a thin coal fired crust and you can really taste the smoky flavor.  The sauce is a more tomato-ey style but it was balanced out well by the other toppings.  Overall a little expensive but pretty good food.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of people over the years rave about this place so when I had movie plans at the nearby Cinemark, I decided to finally give it a try. Since we had plans after we tried to order reasonably so we didn't have a lot of leftovers. We were both in the mood for salad so we went with a small salad to share and a small margherita pizza to share. Judging by the prices on the menu I thought that both would be fairly reasonable in size to share. The salad was definitely more on the small size. I would have expected it to be a little bigger for the price point. The pizza was definitely tasty but I wouldn't say it was worth the price. I've had way better pizza for less.   I did see a lot of people ordering the cauliflower pizza which looked a lot better than it sounded on the menu. While I probably won't be rushing to go back any time soon I would definitely like to make my way back at some point to give the cauliflower pizza a try.",

After seeing a movie at Cinemark, our group decided to grab a bite to eat. Luckily, Anthony's was able to take a call ahead for our group of 7, so we were seated right away (despite it being a busy Saturday).   The pizzas are pretty decent, but after several times at Anthony's I'm noticing they really take the \"pizza well done\" slogan to new levels. As of recently I think they're charring the dough a bit too much. The family sized salad is great to share, with a great light and cleansing dressing. Don't miss out on the wings! They are roasted with caramelized onions and fresh spices... try them!!   All in all, a solid stop if you're in the Robinson area and in need of a decent bite to eat.",

I liked the open-ness of the restaurant.  You can see the pizza being made.. the waitstaff working hard.. etc   The bar was medium size but we were able to find seats.  My friend recommended the wings - so we ordered those. .. I was assured that I would like them.. and I sure did!  Coal Oven Roasted .. they were delicious. I love chicken wings - but always with sauce but it wasn't needed.  They were seasoned but it was just right.   We ordered Pep pizza with extra cheese- very tasty.   It was a great visit..  thanks Anthony's Coal Fire Pizza !!",

That said, we were happy with our shared salad and meatball sandwich. The sandwich was made from a pizza crust, with sliced meatballs and a very spicy pepper - nice! It's an open, clean, loud dining room. The menu is limited to pizza and a couple of salads and sandwiches. There's also a surprisingly diversified by-the-glass wine list. Service was prompt and professional. Anthony's is definitely on our lunch list.",

    "text": "Literally writing this review in the car because this was BY FAR the BEST service we have EVER had in the Pittsburgh area.   My fiance and I decided to give Anthony's a try after numerous recommendations from friends . It's a Friday evening in Robinson, the place is packed, we are greeted & seated right upon entry and immediately are nervous that we probably picked the wrong night to try this place out. A busy night sometimes results in a lack of the \"very best\". Boy were we ever wrong.   Our waitress Kaitlin ( aka Kate ) couldn't have been more helpful, friendly and accommodating. We can honestly say she was 100% PERFECT. Her gracious demeanor , prompt service and professionalism had us sold before we even received the food.   Now for the food. THE FOOD. Two words : GAME OVER. We had a split style pizza that put us both into a food coma, a mojito made at the most accurate percentage and a sampling of wings that left us craving more.   Kaitlin - THANK YOU for making our first experience at Anthony's THE BEST EXPERIENCE we have had since moving to Pittsburgh. You are a shining example of grade a customer service and an overall fantastic human being. We enjoyed the light conversation and your radiant positive energy, you are absolute joy - The food just topped it all off!  If you are thinking twice about Anthony's, stop thinking. Get in the car, drive to this location and ask for Kaitlin!",

We came on a Fri night around 6:30pm and the place was packed with people waiting outside in the dead of winter to get a table.  Now, I love me some good pizza but I'm not sure I'd stand outside waiting for a table in 9 degree weater.  We worked our way to the bar for a drink.  I ordered cabernet and he ordered a cocktail.  We knew this would warm us up.  We were told the table wait would be 35 minutes.  NOPE- they called us in about 10 minutes.  We ordered a large pizza with pepporoni, sweet peppers, and mushrooms.  The pizza was delicious, crisy edges with heat bubbles crispy and black from the coal oven.  So good!  The table next to us ordered a meatball and ricotta pizza.  I wanted to try some- next time, right?  Highly recommended!  It's not the typical burgh pizza - this place is special.  Great atmosphere.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza after a terrible experience at Cadillac ranch-which resulted in only one of us getting a drink(mine was \"forgotten\" about as they changed the tap) and no food. So we were rather hungry at this point and made our way to Anthony's about 30 minutes before they closed.To start, their drinks are insanely expensive for a quick bite after a movie-which was all this was supposed to be. However, my frustration from Cadillac got the best of me and I settled on a glass of wine-for $11.00. My boyfriend got a Yuengling which was considerably more reasonably priced.After reviewing the menu, we decided we wanted to make a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, and olives. Unfortunately, after ordering our server-who was incredibly warm,helpful, and attentive -came back and told us they were out of the prosciutto so we settled for pepperoni. The pizza, of course, was \"well done\" around the edges, however, the center was considerably underdone. The flavors were great and the pizza would have been excellent had it not been for the undercooked center. Overall, we will probably not be back-we had a total of 3 drinks (1 glass of wine,2 yuenglings) and the pizza and our bill was pushing $60.00 which is more than we had originally expected to spend for a quick bite to eat after a movie.And, as I said before, the pizza, although the flavors were good was undercooked in the center-which did not ruin the pizza entirely but came close to it. I do not feel the need to revisit this establishment.",

    "text": "I was pretty disappointed in certain aspects of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. First, this is a tiny, tiny place, I'm guessing seating for around 50, with perhaps another 14 seats at the bar. The pizza kitchen is out in the open with two coal fired ovens glowing orange. Since one Oven is for pizza only and the other for sandwiches, when there are a lot of pizzas being ordered, it can back up, quickly!  This was the case Sunday when the gang didn't want to go to our usual spot for playoff football (the Rock Bottom) and opted instead for Anthony's. I kept telling them is was too new still, and on a Sunday afternoon would be ridiculously packed, and I was right. A table was a 45 min wait and we opted to sit at the bar, waiting for couples to leave or have their table called. Finally we were all able to sit at the bar, some customers were nice enough to move to other sections of the bar so we could all sit together. There is only one screen behind the bar and we were off to the side. (right by the front door, which made for a very chilly atmosphere, later four seats opened in the middle of the bar where it was much warmer)   First disappointment: only two selections on draft?? Sam Adams and an Italian beer. I chose Sam Adams, no pint glasses here, pilsner glasses only. Extensive wine selection and bottled beer. It was only after I ordered a Sam Adams did I know they had Great Lakes IPA. The bartender never showed us a beer menu.   When you order a soft drink, they go to a giant Coke display case like you'd see at Walmart or GetGo. Really? They bring you a bottle of coke or whatever you ordered and a glass of ice. The place is decorated nicely with really nice wood and brick and you have a Coke refrigerator? Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls and of course a signed Dan Marino jersey. Odd seeing Dolphin's pictures and jerseys in a Pittsburgh establishment.  The guys decided on pizza, they ordered a large, half white pizza with ricotta, mozzerella, and Romano. The other half was the \"Dan Marino\" basically a white pizza with sauce and breaded, fried, eggplant. A sign on the wall reads \"our pizzas are well done\" meaning edges are burnt.  For vegetarians they have a roasted cauliflower pizza with cheese, breaded cauliflower, garlic and olive oil. Because they were so crowded, our pizza took almost 35 minutes. The white pizza was ok, I added some parm cheese from the shaker and some hot pepper flakes to give it some flavor. The crust was nothing spectacular, its a thin crust with dark hues from the coal ovens. The guys all mentioned how quickly the pizza cooled as it sat on the bar. To be honest, this pizza wasn't that special, I've had better white pizza at Bado's in Mt Lebanon. This leads me to my second and biggest disappointment. If you bill yourself as a PIZZA restaurant, make sure your pizza is something special!  This pie was nothing out of the ordinary. I would much rather have stayed home, with a half tray of Beto's pizza and watched the games in comfort and growlers of beer from The Rock Bottom or River Town.  For the sweet thooths, there is only one selection for dessert, and it's cheesecake.  This seems to be the new \"in\" place for the South Hills. It draws an older crowd and families  It's noisy, lots of kids, small, crowded and really? ONLY TWO DRAFT BEER SELECTIONS? Really?   I was seriously disappointed, the only saving grace was seeing the Packers lose on that sacred hallowed ground.",

    "text": "When I first heard \"coal fired pizza,\" I imagined the sooty skies of old Pittsburgh and workers wiping their blackened brows- surely an oven powered by coal will also be sooty and smelly, right?  As I understand it, coal is used to super heat the ovens at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza to make their distinct taste, and it works. The mix of delicious recipes and coal oven cooking make Anthony's some of the best pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, or anywhere else. I started off with coal fired wings- these wings are flavored and baked in the coal oven, giving them a crisp, roasted flavor, and then smothered in cooked onions and focaccia bread. The wings are plump and juicy, and I think the onions could be put on the menu by themselves- try putting the onions on the focaccia bread and you'll agree these are a party in your mouth. Next up, we tried the gorgonzola salad, which has tasty greens, iceberg lettuce, onions, chick peas, hard-boiled eggs, and a healthy slathering of oil based dressing. If you like your salad soaked in dressing, you'll love this one, and the chick peas make a nice addition to this yummy salad. However, the pizza is what we came here for, and I wasn't disappointed. I tried the sauceless Mozzarella, Sliced Tomato, and Basil pizza, which had very fresh ingredients, and the crust has a nice crispiness without being dry. Next up, I had to try the meatball ricotta pizza, which is made with their signature parmesan meatballs. This pizza should be outlawed it is so good. The juicy meatballs have a distinct parmesan and basil flavor, the sauce has a mellow tomato flavor without being too acidic, and the ricotta and mozzarella cheese were painted on thick, Plus, the crust was crunchy without being dry, again thanks to the coal fired oven. I'm going back soon to try some of their coal fired sandwiches for lunch, which sound awesome, as well as a calzone that I saw another table order that was so big I could have used as a sleeping bag. Check out this delicious pizza restaurant that has a warm interior. You might notice the Dan Marino pictures everywhere- that's because he is part owner of the South Florida chain, which brings a nice Pittsburgh connection to the restaurant. Also, make sure you say hi to General Manager John Mowod, who took the time to stop at our table to say hi- he's running a great staff that despite the restaurant just opening, ran the place like a well oiled-machine-- or a well fired coal oven.",

There are definitely way better take out pizza places in Robinson, but if you are at Settler's Ridge looking for a fancy looking place to eat pizza, this will do the trick.",

It probably is little pricier than others but you get quality and unique options.  They also have the best wings in Pittsburgh. Marinated in olive oil, herbs and oven roasted.  Last but not least great salad/dressing, their homemade red wine vinaigrette is to die for.",

    "text": "My wife and I noticed this place the last time we went to Settler's Ridge for a movie and agreed to check it out on our next date night, which was last night.  The atmosphere is ok, but nothing special. For a place whose specialty is coal-fired cuisine, I was hoping for something a little more homey.  Our waitress was friendly and checked in on us frequently. Also the place was pretty packed, and yet we got our food VERY fast. The service overall was definitely above average.  We got an order of the wings, which came with caramelized onions and focaccia bread. No sauce, no spices, just coal-fired chicken wings. Excellent! We hogged them down as fast as we could.  The pizza was good. I liked it a little more than my wife did, but even I was hoping for it to be better. We got half with baby meatballs and half with prosciutto. The crust was tasty, and the toppings were good. The cheese and seasonings, though, were a little on the bland side. Again, good, but not as good as I had hoped.  If you're at Settler's Ridge and looking for a place to relax and nosh before walking the 40-50 yards, or so, to catch a movie, Anthony's will do the trick. If you're looking for a kick-butt pie that'll make your eyes roll back into your head, go elsewhere. I absolutely recommend their wings, though.",

I can say however, Anthonys pizza is above the rest! Their meatball pizza is my favorite and their wings are truly the most amazing wings. I love wings, however theirs are like a dry rubbed type wings, with this amazing taste.   Anthonys is in our top 3 pizza places to eat.",

The evening ended well but I lost my phone.  Someone found it in the parking lot and management was kind enough to take it to the hotel I stayed at the night before.  Thank you to the manager, staff, and the kind person who took it to Anthony's.",

Nice lunch spot but i recommend sitting at the bar if you want to have a private conversation.  Otherwise, the tables are close enough that you can be torn between the interview on your left, the sales lunch on your right and the secret office romance behind you.  In that case, i suggest the homemade sangria!  Typically people go there for the pizza and i dont blame them.  My personal favorite is the meatball and ricotta, although the tomato and basil is also good.  Order a lunch salad to round out the day.",

    "text": "After taking in a movie at Settler's Ridge on my day off, my 8 year old daughter piped up, \"Let's try Anthony's for dinner!\"  Actually, we've been meaning to try out their coal fired pizza for a while and usually we go to the area for Thai Foon.  In the mood for something different, we made the very short walk from Cinemark to Anthony's.  The 4 stars in my rating is for the food only.  Everything else might be at a 2 or 3.  The pizza was just great!  We split a large specialty pizza - one half was broccoli rabe and sausage and the other half was meatball and ricotta.  The crust was thin and just lightly burnt from the purported coal fire and the toppings were plentiful and delicious.  I would say that the topping choices on the specialty pizza offerings are very well thought out and gave us plenty of reason to return to branch out a little and try a couple of other combinations.  So, there ends the 4 star portion.  On to the rest: - The seating area is very small.  This place is deceptively large - when you get in, there is a tiny bar area and only about seating for 50 or so.  We had a 20 minute wait and thankfully the food was worth it. - Service was pretty off.  For a Monday night, they were so clearly understaffed.  So, long waits for simple requests like more water, extra napkins, silverware for our party of 4, and our check. - The restaurant itself is hot.  I mean, how could it not be when \"coal fired pizza\" is in the name?  But, better ventilation would make the dine in experience go a lot smoother.",

    "text": "I routinely patronize the original store in Fort Lauderdale and was very happy to see that I could get Anthony's Coal Fired when I am traveling.  The location for this particular part of the chain was really good to get them into a market where people might snub their noses up at a new kind of pizza. With the Cinemark Robinson movie theater a 2 minute walk through the parking lot and ample parking, this Anthony's is continually packed.   Having been to the original, I figured I would be better writing a review that compares and contrasts the locations based on my order:  Pepperoni Pizza Meatballs smaller with less ricotta Chicken Wings  The meatballs with ricotta was first to arrive. The meatballs and portion of ricotta served were smaller. The meatballs tasted slightly different. I couldn't quite tell if it was because there was more filler in the meatballs or if due to the fact that they weren't cooked as much. The ricotta didn't have the same rich and full flavor that I am used to getting at Anthony's.  The chicken wings were the next items to arrive. The only real difference with the wings is that they are not cooked as much. I really do enjoy the charring on the wings and onions and do wish that these were cooked more.  The pizza, while still well-done, was not cooked as much at this location as the other location. My biggest issue with the pizza at the other location was the extent of the burnt crust. At this Anthony's, there is a tad more grace to the cooking in the coal-fired oven. There were really dark brown marks along the crust in places, but no where was the pizza actually burnt. The sauce still had that wonderful peppery tang to it.  Overall, I think the two locations are on an even keel and that they can learn from each other to make the food better. This location can take lessons from the Fort Lauderdale location in the preparation of its appetizers. The Fort Lauderdale location can definitely take some lessons on how to make a coal-fired pizza well done without burning it.",

    "text": "This is a review where the stars are based solely on the service. I've been here several times in the past, and though I'm a NYC pizza kind of guy, something about the burnt thin crust, sauce and toppings really appeal to me. I took an out of town guest here Wednesday night. We were seated almost immediately.  We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage, a small order of meatballs and ricotta, and a couple of iced teas. I still don't get the \"only bottled soft drinks here\" thing. Why no fountain drinks - you have beer taps? C'mon.  Anyway, there was a couple with a small child seated on the other side of the restaurant from us and the little Beelzabub had a scream somewhere between Jamie Lee Curtis and nails on chalkboard. And it was near constant. The parents just talked and laughed, and would give the kids things to play with, which she would immediately deposit on the floor. I didn't want to complain to them or the wait staff, but you'd think they would say something to the couple. Or that the couple would, heaven forbid, parent. But it went on for a bit, disturbing everyone in the restaurant. Such is life I guess - finally they left of their own accord. I'm all for family friendly, but doesn't a Tazmanian Devil fall under the category of pets?  First our meatballs arrived, and they were delicious, with a small dollop of ricotta and sauce. Then our pizza came, with the same delicious burnt crust, good quality crumbled sausage and fresh mushrooms. Can not complain about the food, though it seems many here have. To those who complain about the pizza being well done - CAN YOU NOT READ THE SIGNS POSTED EVERYWHERE IN THE RESTAURANT?  It was then that I noticed that the restaurant seating area was totally devoid of wait staff. They were all congregated behind the service counter in two small groups, giggling away and in discussion. This wouldn't normally bother me (though it might have bothered the other diners who were waiting for service), but our waitress was doubling as the bartender AND was in her own intense conversation with a guy at the end of the bar. She had placed the check on our table about 5 minutes before, and I immediately put down my credit card. She was much too absorbed in conversation to notice much of anything. After about another 10 minutes I gave my check and credit card to another wait person who happened to finally walk by (and who was none to happy that I violated protocol), and she took it immediately to our waitress/bartender. Finally! But of course her conversation with bar anchor wasn't finished, and we had to wait at least ANOTHER 5 minutes until I finally got the receipt to sign.  So, to sum it all up, food top notch, service EXTREMELY spotty.",

The onions were gooood but the wings were lacking flavor except for a little char flavor and a little salty tasting. The pizza was good with a burnt taste which gave it a subtle flavor of charcoal...not overly burnt.  The crust is thin as you would expect for a fired oven pizza.
