We're visiting from Atlanta, but will definitely return if we're in the area again!",

We decided to go for the mozzarella appetizers due to the reviews and we were so glad that we did. Best mozzarella appetizer ever! For dinner my friend had the Reuben sandwich and the portion was great but the sweet potatoes OMG so good! I decided to try the flatbread with the Mac and cheese and I can't describe the flavor but you have to try it and venture out as I did. We can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh and I will be back!

The cocktails are good, with a seasonal menu and there are a lot of beers to choose from. Today, my husband and I went there for dinner.   He had a steak salad.  I had the ward 9 which is a salmon salad.  The steak salad was very over-dressed and the steak had a lot of fat and gristle.  My salmon was ok, not a lot of flavor in the salmon, but it was just o.k.  Also, we never got any refills on our waters, so I would rate the service as o.k. Our waitress was friendly enough, but didn't quite meet the mark.  I guess this place has the look and feel of other trendy, foodie restaurants with craft cocktails, but nothing about the experience really impressed us.",

Can't pass judgment on THAT.  I had a friend tell me it was good.   The food, to be fair isn't BAD.  It's just not good.  What is good...the filament fries.

Guests at our table were choosing to go to the bar and get a drink rather than wait for our waiter who seemed nonexistent.  Every one of our checks was incorrect after only 2 rounds of drinks and we only discovered this because the waiter handed us all our checks before we were even done with our happy hour.   I gave this place a two only because the manager did come over and make things right. I suggest that all guests check their detailed receipts because this is not the first time I heard of the waiters and bartenders adding drinks to their customers receipts.",

The entire building has been made over - no trace of Don Palbos (the restaurant it was before Industry)   Industry has plenty of personality and definitely trendy.  Our waiter was on the ball with our drink refills and I really enjoyed the \"Copper Ale\". It was tasty and not so heavy.   This isn't the type of restaurant that you will receive the over the top friendly staff service.  Its very busy and the wait staff isnt missing a beat.  Plus its very noisy - which is to be expected.  I have heard from friends that the menu items are a bit pricey but I thought it was pretty much standard. Its not a cheap night but affordable.  Honey Lime Sriracha Boneless Wines:    Ok I was sold when I read \"Sriracha\" and had to try these!  They were very tasty and love the kick of course.  Perfect to share and easy to eat.    Teamster Mozzarella Cogs: They were ok.  It was an expected taste and didn't  make my taste buds sing.. basic =meh.  No zing.  Candied Bacon:   Crispy and oh so tasty. Appetizer is ideal for 3-4 people. It's a lot for two people I thought.     After our little appetizer taste test - the bar area cleared out a little bit so we were able to get seats.  The service was ok at the bar. Left around 8:00 PM and still packed!   I look forward to my next visit.. for a burger.   It was a pleasant evening... thanks Industry",

Our waitress was great but even a good waitress can't make up for mediocre food :(  I ordered the most expensive burger on the menu, the lamb burger. I was so excited because the last lamb burger I had in Hawaii was THE best burger I have ever eaten. I don't know if I'll ever order another lamb burger after trying to eat the one I got at Industry Public House. First off I was asked how I wanted it cooked, I said medium. Not only was it grossly overdone, it had absolutely zero flavor. None. Zilch. Nada. It was tasteless! The patty was also packed too tightly, they tried to crush any goodness that was in that poor lamb to begin with. There was supposedly a cucumber mint vinaigrette on it, which was undetectable, and the mozzarella curds sounded sublime but they were basically frozen little nuggets of hard mozzarella fried and thrown on. What a total waste of $$!  My husband went with the Farmed Out Burger. He said it tasted fine, but he doesn't really have the most experienced palate so I always take his word with a grain of salt! If there's meat in it he is usually happy ;)  I did chuckle though when the first bite he took the over easy egg in his burger all spurted out the side of his bun. Clearly they didn't place that in the middle of the bun!  It was a disaster!  Overall I can say I know we will never be back here to eat. Maybe some of their other food is better, I did see good reviews for their salads. They did give a 20% military discount. Thank goodness for that, thank you!",

There are PLENTY of other options with great food and great customer service in the area. Select one of those establishments.",

Waited 15 minutes then bailed. She rang the wrong beer. Paid it without protest (two bucks wasn't worth any more time) and without tip (and I can count on one hand the times I've ever left ANYWHERE without tipping). They get two stars because previous visits weren't this bad. However, they weren't good enough to bring me back again.

    "text": "Gastropub 101 (GP101) - A term I've coined to cover the vast amount of restaurants opening up these days from coast to coast. You know the ones, a hand full of appetizers usually including wings as the main offering, overpriced burgers and sandwiches that you can make much better at home, and dinner offerings that proclaim over the top creativity and deliver forgettable plates of protein and starch with some bagged \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.  Another feature of this new breed of dining experiences is that they look and feel like they're either a chain or want to be a chain imitating the business models of the Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, TGI Fridays etc. without taking the time to develop an actual good service and food plan upfront. I subscribe to the begin with the end in mind philosophy but you have to create a good product and reputation before you go big. And don't worry, I don't consider the examples stellar places to go but I do frequent them from time to to time because of their slightly elevated level of \"didn't suck\". My best experiences are and have always been the mom and pop's places that now join the ranks of the minority in any food scene theses days. Seek them out, give them credit where credit is due, and keep them alive through your patronage.  As a consumer and Yelper I try to give an honest opinion of my experience so you the potential customer can have enough information to go or not to any particular establishment. So now you know what I mean by GP101 you'll understand upfront that while there may be some variation in the place that is noteworthy the restaurant itself didn't suck, wasn't great, and was forgettable in the end.  I attempt to rate by service, ambiance, and quality of food with a clear understanding that the industry's operational tempo can change from day to day depending on a dynamic set of variables we call the human condition, todays great service might be tomorrows bad service just like all of us have off days so do restaurants. You can bet your bottom dollar that if I start off with the place sucked then it really sucked as I'm usually a kind yelper and look for the good over the bad.  Industry Public House: Service - good Ambiance - Unique and interesting sports bar (Only reason for the 3rd star) Food - Forgettable",

I don't mean the ambience or even the menu--urban vibe and gastropub-style eats were perfectly up to par.  I just mean that if you're going to Lawrenceville for a laid-back dinner and and couple of drinks on a warm summer evening, and they've got the windows pulled open and the fresh air streaming in, you're likely not going to mind sitting there for a couple of hours while your food is being prepared, and your SO won't turn down the opportunity to nurse another beer.  But for a weekday team lunch out in Robinson, which is what I imagine a good majority of this location's traffic comes from, the service here is just downright inefficient.  My team of 8 waited spent about 2 hours here before we were able to receive our check, with 7/8 only ordering an entree, and no desserts ordered at all.  With a large table, I could perhaps understand this if we arrived in the middle of the lunch rush, but when we got there at an early 11am, the place was near deserted.  While luckily, none of us had anything pressing immediately after lunch that day, we collectively made a mental note to avoid this place for work lunches in the future.  The food just isn't special enough to warrant such a wait.",

It's a cool experience- but it was the highlight.  They are great for beer with many to choose from. Their flat screens offer a \"ticker\" of their selections, but even from close range it's hard to see. (I pride myself on great eyesight).  I'm a sucker for a new place in the area for \"happy hour\" because I work close by, but this is a place that I would only go to every once in a while and only worked a 3 star wonder for me.",

We were looking forward to a Friday night beer and this was the perfect place to go to. They have 3 of their own beers that that they brew and 2 pages of other beer on tap, so you will definitely find something you like! I had their Copper Ale, which was comparable to a Yuengling and I liked it a lot! We started off with an appetizer - the mozzarella cogs, which was mozzarella sticks, but in a disc shape. The marinara sauce that paired with this appetizer was really good! For our meals, we both had burgers. I had the Worker Burgher, which was topped with goat cheese, arugula and mushrooms. I looove goat cheese and this was delicious! Mike had the Farmed Out Burgher, which had white cheddar, bacon, BBQ, and a fried egg (which is his favorite topping on a burger!). He loved it. The burgers come with an insane amount of fries, that are really delicious. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, especially when I needed to pick a beer. It is a little pricey there, but we will definitely go back to try other dishes on their menu!",

The bartender was super friendly and knowledgable and let me try all 3 different kinds of cider so I felt really happy with my ultimate decision of ordering a locally made brew -the Arsenal Fighting Elleck Cider (perfect mix of sweet & dry).  l also got to try some nibbes: - Chicken Nachos: frankly meh. The cheese was too plasticky. Good guac and sour cream size - Fried pickles: liked the mix of crisp with the soft and the heat with the cool. - Flat Bread with Fresh Basil & fresh mozzarella: decent but I have had better.  So food wise it's only a 3 star for me but the bar choices and the bartender were 5 stars hence compromising with the 4 star. I'd come back here to try a drink, but not for the food.

    "text": "Industry Public House - interesting name considering all industry such as steel, mining and heavy manufacturing have all but left or have been ran out of the Pittsburgh region.   It seems Industry Public House has brought a new industry to south western Pennsylvania - Salt Mining.  Salt mining you ask? Yes. I will explain momentarily.   Having decided to try IPH on a whim, we sampled quite the variety of offerings. We tried the nacho's with chicken, which were very good. The chicken in them was excellent and the fresh jalapenos were great as well.   As far as entree's I had the Farm Burger. Beef, wild boar bacon, BBQ, white cheddar, and a undercooked, exceptionally runny egg. Bottom line up front, don't put the egg below the patty. While the beef patty was quite good, it was probably the slickest burger I'd ever partook in. First bite and everything slid off the bun. I chose to eat it with a fork. Sad, no longer a handheld  My girlfriend decided to have the boneless chicken bites, the hot parmesan, they were probably the best product which we tried. Th breading was nice and they were not overcooked. Probably the best part of the experience.  Also sampled were the pot roast fries. One forkful and they were sent back. We couldn't deduce whether it was the gravy, the beef, or the fries which were so exceptionally salty, but they were inedible.   The server had asked if something else could be substituted and an order of regular fries were brought over. They too were absolutely covered in sea salt. Large flakes of visible salt. Again, inedible.   I'm not sure if this is done so you choose to drink more or just an oversight. I'm usually one to notice if a food product is over salted, but it was not me this time who noticed how salty the product was.  The beer selection however was exceptional, that was the only redeeming quality of IPH to me.   I would also like to point out that the men's room was in dire need of cleaning.   It was a one and done kind of experience. Hopefully they can polish things up.",

The layout of the restaurant is awesome- definitely would be a great spot to come and watch a game or have a few drinks on Friday night. We started off with the fried pickles and the buffalo mac & cheese flatbread. My dad loved the flatbread and thought it was so unique. I really enjoyed both of the appetizers. I had the chicken sandwich for my main mail, which was delicious. My family enjoyed their meals as well. Our service was great and we had a great time! If I am in the Robinson area again and looking for somewhere to eat, we will be back!",

    "text": "Love this new location of Industry Public House!! I had always thought the beverage selection and food were tasty in the original Lawrenceville location, but between tough street parking and a very hectic restaurant space, I was never super motivated to dine there. However, with this new location in the Robinson area, there's a large parking lot and a huge restaurant space that can seat hundreds of people. Plus, it's become my favorite restaurant to grab lunch or dinner before shopping at IKEA.  Food: Make sure to try the Industrial Size Soft Pretzel if you have 4 or more people in your party (or are just ready to enjoy a lot of carbs yourself). The pretzel is perfectly soft, and both the beer cheese and cinnamon icing sauces are great complements to it. I haven't personally tried the Built to Order Nachos, but my brother-in-law ordered them while in town last weekend, and I loved that the toppings were layered throughout the tortilla chips, not just all dumped on top. Plus, they looked super tasty! Both times that I've dined here, I've ordered the Fish 'n' Chips. The serving of beer-battered cod is enormous, and I'd recommend substituting sides for sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. The sweet potato fries are both soft and crispy with a sweet coating, and the mac and cheese has a rich and creamy and cheesy sauce.  Drinks: Industry has something for everyone as far as drinks, from beer, liquor, wine, and mixed drinks. Personally, I've only had the Spiced Pear Sangria. The beverage was OK, but I thought was a bit too fall-flavored to be on the menu year-round.   In addition to the good food and drinks, I've thought the service here has been strong, too, from prompt seating and food delivery to courteous service and frequent check-ins throughout the meal.  Already looking forward to coming back here next time I need to make an IKEA run. :)",

Between the tasty drinks and lick smacking food menu, I'm not sure why it's not more packed.  Shhh let's keep it our secret!  But honestly, I'm a huge fan. I had the best bartender/ waiter while sitting at the bar late one Sunday. There wasn't a question he couldn't answer about the food menu or the beer selection. His accuracy was on point too.   Do try one of the draft beers, but don't forget the liquor menu because the bartenders take extra care to get it just right.   I ordered a humongous soft pretzel. They warned that it was the size of my head... but I'm not that big headed this thing was the size of my torso! The beer cheese was pretty yummy that accompanied it.   I will be back. The intimate setting, great staff and killer menu will keep this place alive.",

There are 2 levels in the restaurant and I sat up top. There is a 2nd bar so we didn't have to wait as long. The bartender asked about of preference and gave us samples to try. I said I was a fan of Blue Moon and suggested a berry/citrus beer. I wasn't too impressed but a friend of mine who suggested cocktails suggested the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby.   This wouldn't be my first choice but it was good. The flavors were good and the booze was strong. It was beautiful in a short glass with purple swirls with a large basil leaf.   The atmosphere on a Friday night was pretty relaxed. There were plenty of TV screens in this place but sitting on the 2nd level, you got to look around.",

The chairs were trendy, but way too hard and uncomfortable.  The food varied greatly. Some items like the fried mozzarella cogs were pretty good (but a little greasy). Other items like the club sandwich were much too dry. The fish and chips was good and bad - fish was incredible, fries were cold. Their house beers - meh. Nothing particularly wrong with them, but far from the quality I expect from craft brewing.  Desserts were also a hit and miss. The cheesecake got rave reviews, but the red velvet cake was dry and, while red, did not taste like red velvet. The cream cheese icing was grainy. One person got an ice cream cookie sandwich and was not given a spoon until he asked for it (and didn't get it until the ice cream was half melted). No one was given a clean dessert fork. We had to use our dirty dinner forks.   Their timing was horrible. We'd barely taken two bites of our appetizers before the entrees showed up - with one exception. We waited about another five minutes for the fish and chips to show up, and it didn't. We had to ask for it.  When we're spending over $50 a head, I expect much better food and service. While it wasn't so bad that I feel the need to warn people away from the place, I'll never be back.",

I also ordered blue cheese with my wings, which had a black hair in it and this couldn't have been mine since I have blonde hair (quite gross). When we got our check we assumed the fries would at least be knocked off the check since they came out late and since the hair incident, but nope the check stayed the same. Overall, this was not the best experience.",

My husband and I ordered a pretzel appetizer. It was large enough to feed a small country. The dough was slightly sweet and crisp with big flakes of ball park size salt. Served upright and hot on a rack it was not only delicious but fun.   As an entree I ordered (apologies for getting the name wrong) farm house or farm fresh burger. It was also huge with bacon and a fried egg. A juicy perfectly cooked-to-order beef patty that was roughly the size of my head on a fresh bun. Knife and fork are required for eating.

What kills me is that i think a 4-4.5/5 is very achievable by industry public house- it is in a great location with only a handful of competitors. It has a phenomenal collection of brews and wonderful interior venue. It has a great menu, it just needs to focus on making it a great value compared to its competitors.

Took about 10 minutes to flag someone down to order food. The food came out quickly and was delicious. Turkey was smoky and yummy. Husband loved his smokestack, too. Also struggled to flag someone down for the bill, but we finally got there!   I'm willing to give the place another shot so I can taste that turkey again.

    "text": "A hot and new place in North Fayette, finally! If that's not enough excitement, I will am happy to say that this place's food is BOMB! I'm giving Industry Public House a reserved 4 stars for these reasons:  I am in love with the aesthetics and ambience of this place. It's a completely different feel from the Don Pablos that was there before. With a huge bar, the industrial setting, and clean environment, it gives this place a cool, hip, yet relaxed atmosphere that made the dining experience special.   The food was fantastic! I had the upsidedown chicken sandwich with fries. The \"upsidedown\" name comes from using an everything bagel upsidedown and they do the dirty by sandwiching a juicy chicken breast, sauces, and arugula between the bagel slices. The details don't do justice in how actually tasteful it was! My traveling companion had one of their burgers and it was equally, maybe even more, flavorful.  They have a great selections of beers and other spirits, above which I expected. I tried the Industry copper ale and it was a pretty tastey amber ale.  All above things are great, however I did say a reserved 4 stars. The service was a somewhat disappointing. I would be more pleased if the service team showed more enthusiasm and not so distracted by other priorities. But it's really the food, drink, and ambience that makes this place special.",

They had improved their cleanliness some (but still slow to bus some tables), and although much of the food is not bad, their burgers are on the dry side, even when medium rare, and the fries are normally soggy. After pushing you to close out early, on an otherwise busy night, some bartenders will now hustle you to leave well before their posted 2 a.m. closing hour (which we rely on in deciding to go there), citing \"volume\" and confusing last call with closing time (what?). I haven't experienced a more abusive and officious bartender who really doesn't understand his/her business like this in a very long time, and I've seen bad (yes, I have been one in more than one place, thanks). This all suggests this place may be looking to cut corners in other ways, plus growing staff entitlement issues. No thanks.",

When the salad came out my friend asked AGAIN if the salad was nut free and AGAIN we were assured it was. She starts eating the salad only to find *shocker* A NUT. Luckily her allergy isn't life or death, but to be assured multiple times that it would not contain nuts to then find a nut is unnerving. The waitress apologized multiple times which was nice but then did say she found a nut on the first attempt to make the salad....the manager on the other hand handled the situation TERRIBLY. He brought over a new salad (why would she want that?) and then offered to take the $10 salad off and that was it. He did not offer to take off her appetizer and his apology seemed insincere. After asking we did get our meals for free but the attitudes of the staff (besides the nice waitress) weren't great. Would NOT recommend this restaurant if you have any type of allergy as they don't seem to take the situation seriously.",

We got there and it seemed fairly crowded.  After a short wait, our party of 5 was shown to a table on the second floor that overlooked the lower bar area.    The menu had a great many choices.  The giant, soft pretzel was a big hit with all of us   We chose to have the beer cheese to accompany it. The amount given seems not enough for such a big pretzel and we had to ask for another. It came with no problem.  My burger was done perfectly and had a side of fries.  Everyone was pleased with their food and the portions were very generous.    Our server was attentive and available for any requests.  A nice variety of beers to chose to go with your meal.   The only issue we had was the noise level that came from the first floor.  It was very difficult to carry on a conversation. Everyone kept having to repeat themselves several times.  This wasn't a deal breaker as we plan on returning next time in the area.",

That was the last beer we were served at this establishment on this date. Our waitress talked to others at the bar all night and we didn't see another beer until we made it home. This was the worst experience at a bar I've ever had. I won't return",

Waiter was friendly, but each item seemed to take a long time to show up.  Tuna appetizer was good, but it took more than 15 minutes to show up.  Note that it is not cooked.  Entrees (Chicken and Tacos), took another 40 minutes and were cold when they got to the table.  Drink orders also took too long.  Disappointing because the food would have been good (if it was warm) and the beer list is intriguing.  Can't see a reason to go back....",

The interior design is very industrial (no surprise there) and eclectic. Very cool atmosphere and the place is massive so we've rarely had to wait. There are a ton of TVs so it's a good place to go during a sporting event. The draft beer list is huge and there are also a number of whiskeys to choose from. Everything we've eaten has been delicious. I'd recommend any of the burgers, the pot roast, and the mozzarella cogs as a starter.",

The appearance of the food was great and the fries.... oh my goodness. I have never had such good fries. They are the perfect temperature, crunch (but not too crunchy), and soft (but not mushy).

    "text": "My wife and I were out for the afternoon, looking for lunch, and wondered if Don Pablo's was still here.  We pulled in to see it was a new place and decided to give it a try.  Immediately saw that Industry has a nice atmosphere, and a unique theme (circa prohibition).  Service was immediate, and they had a great selection of beers and whiskey.  My wife wasn't sure which was which, and it's a great option that they offer up to three beer samples!  The menus were unique and offered a decent variety, although perhaps a little too clever for someone just looking a standard burger.  We ordered a nachos appetizer which arrived a little burnt, but oh well, just pick around the burnt chips, right?  But then our main courses arrived within 5 minutes of receiving the appetizer, which is a bad timing issue they'll need to work out.  Having both arrive that soon apart means you have to decide which to eat before something goes cold.  My wife barely touched her chicken salad, later opting to box it to avoid wasting the appetizer.  That should never happen.  My burger was okay, but some of the toppings were burnt, as were the fries, which appeared to be just the crispy remnants at the bottom of the bin.  I had to borrow ketchup from another table, as the service was a bit lax, which I suppose is to be expected with a new place.  Besides these things, I had hoped that maybe just digging into a good burger with barbecue sauce would save lunch for me.  Unfortunately, even the barbecue sauce was weirdly sour as opposed to tangy or sweet.  The manager swung by with the standard inquiry, and we only mentioned the meals coming right after the appetizer.  She offered us a \"friends and family\" discount, which was honestly appropriate.  Unfortunately, we weren't pleased enough to recommend Industry Public House to our friends and family...or to Yelp.",

There were easily ten servers standing around and talking in the empty restaurant but no one waiting on us or acknowledging us.  When a gentleman server (who hadn't previously seen us) was finally notified we needed help (after we inquired if someone could help us--a request that 4-5 servers just standing there heard, causing them to look at me like I had five heads), he was wonderful, obviously frustrated by the situation.  Ordinarily I wouldn't have an issue with the first part because I don't think the hostess told anyone.    Mistakes happen.  It's the part where I kindly request a server and was met with a \"how dare you ask that\" attitude.  5-10 minutes later they sent someone over to help us.  The server we got was great, though.",

The service was terrible and the food mediocre at best..  Got the Factory fried chicken sandwich, overdone and very salty.  There was a microscopic drop of tomato something or other on it, very dry.  Other person with me got the Industry pot roast and was quite happy with it.  Had the nachos for an appetizer, got then rather quickly and then 5 minutes later our food came, didn't really have time to eat or enjoy the nachos.  Very poor timing on the waitresses part, but oh wait, she only came around every 20 min or so, so how would she know?  As we walked in, the place really wasn't that busy, saw no one inside, except at the bar, most were eating outside.  As we waited for the hostess to decide where to seat us, another couple walked out because they were tired of waiting for service outside, we,of course, chose to sit outside, in hindsight we should have followed that couple out the door and went to eat somewhere else!  Very disappointing..",

First the decor was perfect. I loved the industrial look they had going (suits the name). I got the smoke stack which was good but what stood out were the pot roast fries. They didn't just top the fries with a few pieces of pot roast and drizzle some gravy on top they poured the toppings on. They also have 60 beers on tap which is a dream to all craft beer lovers. I would have to say that the best thing about this restaurant was the server. I really wish I remembered his name. We were in on a Monday afternoon around 2. He has long hair and a beard. Was some of the best service I've gotten from a restaurant. He was recommending beers and telling us about the restaurant. I would definitely come back to this place.",

It was packed on a Friday night but we got a table for four in only about 15 minutes. Service was friendly and above average. We tried the truffle fries which were smothered with bleu cheese as well as the mozzarella cogs and both were pretty decent. My \"worker\" burger was cooked correctly (medium rare) and the Mac n cheese was just alright. My date said her flatbread was delicious. The menu is pretty limited, with mostly burgers, apps, sandwiches and couple of main entrees which they call \"sustenance\", but I really dig the smaller \"gastropub\" menu. The entire restaurant gets really noisy, and conversation was difficult, even with the person sitting right next to me. The food probably won't blow you away, but it probably won't disappoint either. Just leave your redneck-love of all things Anheuser-Busch at home, because you won't find any of it here, which in my book is a great thing. I dig a Bud occasionally (see profile pic), but come on, we're living in the golden age of suds and it's a freakin' great time to be a beer lover.

After 15-20 minutes I had to go to the hostess stand to ask if anyone would be waiting on us, or if we should just sit at the bar.  The hostess was not very pleasant and seemed bothered to even be questioned.  Our waitress finally came over where she took our orders, with minor adjustments.  One of us asked her about the turkey sandwich, and if it was carved or sliced turkey.  After being told about it, she decided to go with the chicken salad sandwich.  Which our waitress didn't write down any of our orders.  Our food finally came out, soup was missing a spoon.  My side of lettuce and tomato was forgotten, and a turkey sandwich came out instead of the chicken salad sandwich.  I know people make mistakes, but write down an order to make sure it's done right.  Better communication is needed between the staff as to when patrons are sat in their sections.  This was lunch time and was not busy at all.  Greaters/hostesses are supposed to be friendly and welcoming, not angry and bothered when spoke to.  Food was hot and tasty to say the least.  The staff needs a big improvement.",

When we arrived we noticed it was packed out, which is usually a good sign.  The building itself is really rustic and trendy. It has a divey feel to it and has a lot of great areas for large or private parties. I was in love with the layout and overall space and decor.  They have a pretty short menu, but have a solid group of burgers, sandwiches and other platters, like Fish & Chips. It's a good beer-with-food kind of place. They have a bunch of specialty drinks as well as an extensive number of beers on tap.   I ordered their classic burger which I enjoyed and thought was good. It was hearty, fresh and was a plenty big portion. Most of my companions were satisfied with their meals, expect one friend who ordered their boneless wings. There didn't seem to be anything special about the platter and she seemed less than excited about it.   I'm actually struggling between giving 4 stars or only 3; mainly because we weren't thrilled with our service. Our server must have been having a bad day, but seemed curt and abrupt. She seemed bothered and it made us feel uncomfortable to ask for things. She did the minimum to serve us.   In the end, I'll go ahead and give 4 stars because for the most part, we were all satisfied with our meals. The service just wasn't great.",

    "text": "As someone who works in the service industry, I can almost always understand the back end of what might be causing less than average service. However, my experience at Industry in Robinson was so horrific I am literally warning people not to go to this location.  My husband and I were at the mall and STARVING so we thought we'd try Industry again (we went several years ago and couldn't remember why we never went back). We were sat at a table in the bar area for 10 minutes with no one greeting us or even saying they would be back to take care of us. We moved to sit at the bar and again sat for over 5 minutes before being semi acknowledged- the bartender was picking up all of his tip receipts (literally right in front of us as we took a previous guest's spot after they closed their check) and checking out what he was tipped, ringing in his tips, organizing random things, etc before even saying hello. A guest next to us was very unhappily sending back his cold food, which should have clued us to just have 1 beer then leave. Unfortunately we didn't. We ordered nachos as an app, a chicken sandwich, and a Caesar salad. The food took an insane amount of time to come out and no reasoning or apology was ever offered to explain what the hold up was. Remember the man who was sending his fish tacos back when we sat down? He got a new set of tacos and ate his whole meal before we even got our app. As we were waiting we also heard another customer demand to speak to a manager about their experience. The nachos eventually came out with our meals and when I say they were rock hard, I mean you couldn't even pull a chip out because they were sitting under the heat lamp so long the cheese hardened into a mountain of brown disgusting shit. They put some cold sour cream and guacamole on top to pass it off as fresh. I would have sent them back, but the bartender was no where to be found and never came to check on us after someone else delivered our food. I had to flag down another server because my husbands salad had no dressing on it- just a bowl of romaine lettuce with a chicken breast on top. Our beers sat empty for half of our meal and no one was around to ask if we'd like another or even offer us water. The one redeeming quality was that my hot chicken sandwich was good and they have delicious fries, but there is nothing else positive I could say about our experience. The staff is unfriendly and have zero people skills, it is dark as hell and as a 28 year old with perfect vision I could barely read the menu, and the management is clearly complacent and asleep at the wheel if they think their restaurant is doing well. As I said, being in the service industry something would have to be SO awful for me to ever write a review like this, but this place pushed me there. I can't recommend enough that you NEVER go here and save your hard earned money to be spent somewhere that actually deserves it. As I said, we are going out of our way to warn people about how awful our experience was so please save yourself the headache and look elsewhere.",

The buns on the burgers were too crumbly & fell apart & also had a lack of any flavor they were disappointing as well as the patty itself. We got the candied bacon for an appetizer & it was $10 for 5 pieces of bacon that was hard to even chew. Meh. The flight of drinks we ordered was great, our server was really helpful, nice & on top of her game. Just wish the food was better.",

Come with plenty of homemade fries that are also delicious.  Had a few drinks that are very reasonably priced and I tried their in house IPA which was pretty good.   The service was also solid. It was slightly busy but I was greeted promptly and served a drink in a good amount of time. They recommended the beer and described it well.

The chicken on the President's salad (caesar salad) is just out of this world. It is seasoned so perfectly with cajun seasoning. It's not too salty or too spicy. Something about it just goes so well with the caesar salad. My boyfriend tried it this last time and he said he would definitely order it the next time.  The drink options are excellent and they have something for everyone. They have multiple beers, ciders, etc on tap. Everyone is likely to find something for them. If not they have some mixed drinks that also look fairly good. I unfortunately haven't tried any of them yet but their sangria was delicious.  The only reason I can't give this place a 5 star is because it's overly crowded. Both times I was seated at a high table by the bar and both times it was during happy hour. The crowd was very large at the bar and I felt like I was basically sitting with the people at the table next to me because we are so close together.",

The Smokestack, smoke infused bourbon or rye, was a thing of art and fun to watch being prepared. The bar staff was super attentive and friendly.  My Reuben was a little disappointing. The house made corned beef was quite good and much better than typical lunch meat corned beef. That is where the sandwich stopped exceeding my expectations. I found there to be too little corned beef and the rest of the sandwich was had typical diner ingredients: standard pre-sliced marble rye that was lightly toasted, not grilled, making it flabby; the sauerkraut and cheese were nothing special. I was expecting more elevated gastro-pub food with a pile of meat for the price.  I am local and look forward to trying something else in the near future. I would definitely come back for drinks.",

It was absolutely delicious the portion size was good and tasted delicious. The side I got was sweet potato fries which was equally delicious. They put cinnamon and sugar on them so be aware of that but it is quite tasty.   For dessert I order the ice cream sandwich. There are a variety of flavors for the cookie as well as the ice cream. Definitely save room for dessert. Price wise it's pretty comparable to any restaurant you'll eat at in robinson.   My gf and I got an app both had a sandwich and upgraded our sides and I got a dessert. Total cost was just over $50.   The server we had was very attentive and was very helpful with ordering. I definitely would recommend trying this restaurant out if you haven't tried it yet.",

I could see this place filling up for major sporting events.  The bar area is huge. We were out shopping and just wanted a bite for lunch, something light.  HA wrong place for that.  As soon as we saw the pretzel with beer cheese on the menu we had to try it.  HUGE! It was good, really good, but overpriced at $15. I had the grilled chicken salad with ranch dressing.  The dressing really had no distinct flavor at all, but the veggies were fresh and chicken was cooked perfectly. My mom opted for the pot roast fries and again the portion size was enough for  family of 6 to share.  I'd say this is a great place for a large group to order a couple of items to share.  Make sure you are starving when you go!",

The only bad thing for me is the staff can be hit or miss. I've had great bartenders there, I've had some that definitely make you feel like you're somehow interrupting their day.

The $6 chili cheese fries had such potential, but hope was dashed by the bottom-of-the-barrel fry basket I was presented with.

Two examples:  1) when we walked in, we heard screaming children (a surprise since the music was very loud) and asked to be seated anywhere but near the screaming child.  The host promptly walked us back to a table right next to two, count 'em two, screaming children!  And then looked surprised when we didn't want to sit there; 2) my husband ordered a meal which came with fries - we had to call the server back to get ketchup.  We expressed an interest in dessert, even though we weren't asked if we'd like some (no attempt to upsell), but then the server brought the check instead of the menu.  Better training would benefit this place a lot.  And my leftover mac & cheese was a lot better after I added to it and cooked it properly at home.",

I'm not one to pick, but the service was really lacking.  For there being so few people in the restaurant, when I visited, the wait to be served... a drink, let alone the food was extreme... and I'm a very patient & understanding person.  The food itself was OK, I had the Falafel Wrap.  Industry does look like a good place to go with friends for drinks.  Looks like they're doing some creative things with their drinks.  I'll probably stop back in to give them another try.",

I sampled a cheeseburger and the tomato/mozzarella flatbread, and both were very good. Happy Hour price of $5 make either a must-have with drinks.  Also sampled one of the \"Smokestack\" whiskey drinks - essentially a take on an old fashioned, but with your choice of a LONG list of whiskeys and maple syrup. The kicker? It's poured through charred wood of your choice (I tried the cherry), giving the drink a smoothness and smokey flavor that was unlike anything I'd had before. I'll go back for this drink, for sure.  Excited to try this place again soon!",

    "text": "My husband and I have been to Industry multiple times and a much as it pains me to say it: all things considered, it's just average.   Food: is either on point or lacking. We vary between getting our usual favorites or trying something new and no matter what, it's hit or miss. The same meal will be amazing one day and just average the next. I will say that I have only been disappointed with their 9th Ward Salad (IMO the best thing on their menu) twice. Once because it was over dressed the one time I ordered it at their Lawrenceville location and a second time at Robinson where they forgot the goat cheese (picky, I know but I love me some goat cheese). Other hit and miss faves have been their wings, the roast beef and the fish & chips.  Drinks: great beer list. Cocktails are amazing. The smokestack, arguably my favorite drink and their signature is also hit or miss. Their bartenders/servers are knowledgeable about which whiskeys go well with which wood. How the smokestack is prepared is another story. Bottom line: burn all the freaking wood. Take another 20 seconds to make sure you've lit the whole pire. And then make sure that you've covered the whole damn thing and the smoke is actually getting into the whiskey and not seeping out the shaker. Picky? Again, yes. But this is your SIGNATURE DRINK. Make it perfect EVERY TIME. And honestly, if you can't, don't make it a point to make it in front of me. I AM judging your technique.  Service: is honestly sub par for the quality you'd expect at this calibur of restaurant. Again, hit and miss but almost every server has had their disappointing moments. First was when we were seated and then forgotten about (i.e. our server, who was AWESOME, did not know he was assigned to us and at least four other employees walked by us in 15 minutes and did nothing). Second was just slow service on the floor in general, our server taking the time to get us drinks and put in our food order, but when the food was served we were ignored for quite some time. When we learned our lesson and switched to sitting at the bar it didn't get much better. There have been some stand-out bartenders (read: those who actually do what they are paid to do - be attentive to all their patrons, refill empty beer glasses promptly, and follows up after meals are served) and those who just don't. Like the girl at brunch who spends more time complaining to her co-workers than serving and not noticing the beer that has been empty for 15+ minutes. And another bartender who's attentive until the food comes out and completely forgets to follow up (\"how is everything? Do you need anything else?\"). Or the other bartender becoming kerfuffled when after ignoring us and finally getting around to us, we get a little snippy with her, and instead of making up for it she goes back to ignoring us to clean glasses at the other side of the bar. Petty of us? Sure. But honestly, all this woman needed to do was touch base when she walked by (\"how y'all doing? Can I get you anything?\"). I think what it boils down to is the servers are only paying attention (at best) to revenue based services and not the services that make our meal pleasant. For us, if your service is great, regardless of the quality of the food, you'll get a good tip. But hit or miss food, we have not had a reason to tip well for quite some time.  With that all being said, I do enjoy Industry, I really really do. Their beer list is amazing and when their food is good it's incredible. But the service is something I would expect at...I don't know, I'd say Applebee's but they have great service, lol.",

    "text": "Having a family who comes from the serving industry, and owns a local bar/ restaurant of their own... this place had been a mess EVERY time that I'm there. The food is usually decent, but the service is consistently awful.   Today I sat down at the bar for lunch and ordered the chili and a president salad. The bartender took a solid 10 minutes to even roll on by despite the restaurant being empty.  He asked our orders. To which we ordered two beers, two soups, and two president salads (dressing  on the side). The bartender then left and had a conversation with the rest of the staff at the host stand (6-8 of them) while other patrons at the bar looked around and tried to get their attention for service. This went in for another 15 minutes. Not a single employee came by and asked if anyone wanted waters or drink refills, they stood at the host stand while everyone sort of sat in awe at the shit service. Then the food came out. The chicken on the salad was so salty that it was inedible, both salads came drenched in so much dressing despite having asked for one with dressing on the side, the soup was cold. The server never came by to ask if anything was ok. Never came by to ask if we needed refills. Never came by to ask if we needed anything else. Another 15 minutes went by and we flagged the bartender down and asked for our check.   Coming from the service industry, we did not stuff him or make any ridiculous Complaints. But this has now been the 3rd time service has been atrocious and the food had been messed up. Not that one customer matters, but I absolutely will not be back again.   I really hope the GM can re-train their staff or at minimum, hold a meeting to discuss attentiveness and basic skills.   Best of luck",

I think that's awesome, but I'm not sure if that's what we were in the mood for at that moment.   I love the fact that they have Leona's ice cream sandwiches. They're really tasty, and there's always different flavors at different times of the year. We ordered the cherry vanilla/chocolate chunk & it was gone in like 2 seconds. So tasty.",

We started out with the Candied Bacon and some fries with truffles and blue cheese. Both were good. I had the Assembly Mac and Cheese that I added Pot Roast to. Very good and filling! My wife actually ordered the same thing. My siblings had the fried chicken sandwich which was also large and filling.  All-in-all everything was very good. Food service was very quick!

She was super friendly and made our experience a great one. The prices for lunch were reasonable since the portions were the perfect size.   For lunch, I had the turkey sandwich on a gluten free bun. I am so thrilled that Industry has gluten free buns now, because it allows me to try other things on their menu besides the salads. For vegan friends, they have impossible burgers now. My turkey sandwich was excellent, the turkey had a nice peppery and smoky taste to it. The toppings were piled generously too, for example, there was a ton of bacon and gruyere cheese on my sandwich. On the side, I decided to try the blue cheese truffle fries because I heard they were delicious. Well that's right! The truffle fries are so yummy. I never thought of blue cheese and french fries being a good combo, but Industry makes it work! The fries are a tad salty, but other than that, they were tasty.   I am very happy that Industry's food quality improved and how they added gluten free/vegan things to the menu. I am also pleased by the outstanding wait staff here and I will certainly be back!",

Menu was big enough to have choices yet small enough to not be overwhelmed. Appetizers were fantastic, specifically the industrial-sized pretzel and the two house bacon options. Reuben sandwich was very good, fish and chips were excellent and the pierogies were passable.  Wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "I'm very impressed with the space at this restaurant. There is a large downstairs dining area, an outside seating area, and additional seating upstairs which our server told me is available for parties. The decor is beautiful, similar to Industry in Lawrenceville but much larger.  Our server was slammed, and we weren't in a hurry - he was still very attentive for the most part and very helpful when it came to selecting our food and beer. A few things, we didn't have silverware and a soup order was forgotten until the main course came out.  My salmon salad was very good. I normally have a negative review towards salads with hardly any toppings (which is what I had) but whatever they seasoned the kale with was unbelievably tasty which is probably why there wasn't much else on the salad.   I would recommend this location for anyone looking for a casual dining experience with a huge beer, wine, and cocktail selection.",

    "text": "Four reasons I'll never come back:  1) One of my friends was stung by a bee. Inside. And I get it, nature happens, can't control every insect. But the way our waitress handled it, all she said when we told her was \"oh. Sorry.\" And then walked away back to stand with the other servers.   2) The food itself was mediocre for its price. I got the pulled pork, which should've been called a coleslaw sandwich with a side of pulled pork. Barely any meat. On top of that, my food came out cold, along with my two friends. Not even slightly warm, just like they've been sitting around for 20 mins.   3) The wait was awful. We got seated right away, a maybe halfway full restaurant on a Thursday at 6. We got our food maybe at 7:30. My friend went through three beers before we got our food, it was ridiculous, and again our waitress was no help.   4) They can't even serve beer correctly. If you're going to pose as a suedo-hipster bar/restaurant, at least do one thing right. Asked for a draft, they served it to me in a can. Not even a can into a glass, a shaken, foamy, can.   This place is an overpriced, pretentious, bar that doesn't have anything going for it besides it's pretzels, which I'll admit are good, but again, are they $15 good? Used to be a regular, not coming back again.",

My margarita... it arrived with a foreign body in it, two pieces of wood. Wood Chips from another type of drink they make!  The kids chicken fingers... we sent them back twice... yes twice and they were still inedible!    The manager did take the chicken fingers and flight of beer off of our bill. He later returned with a voucher for a free app. We graciously declined as we will never return.   My husband asked for more off of our bill and he agreed. When we received our bill, frank apparently changed his mind as no discount was taken.   We are not ones to complain!  We took our 3 children out to dinner and really hoped for a nice evening and dinner. How very VERY disappointing!   Worth noting, our server John, took a family and friends discount off for us!!",

We thought he was wonderful and a great server and had a great personality. Our server went on to elaborate that he was fired because he was old, set in his ways and would not do his work. Somehow, my husband and I don't believe that. Compared to this Heather, he was a complete professional Server Heather was a wreck. she ran around like she was lost. forgot our drinks and had to remind her about it. Silverware was dirty and food was greasy and tasteless. I had the smokestack and the bread was sopping wet with butter. not crispy or toasted. We ordered several different beers but was told they were out of each one of them so we opted for iced tea. Needless to say, the next time we come to Pittsburgh for an event, which we do regularly, we will eat at Olive Garden, Max and Ermas or one of the other local restaurants.",

It got to the point sometimes where we just went up to the bar and ordered because our waitress was no where to be found.

It wasn't bad but I'll probably order something else next time. I know its inevitable but it was soggy when I got home.

It was a large beer battered fillet, with slaw and I opted for the mac n cheese.. the mac and cheese was definitely a good choice. The fish was good as long as you peeled off the extremely greasy breading.  The name of the place also doesn't do it justice. But all and all we had a nice time. They have a huge drink/beer selection. I would be willing to give the fish another try, hopefully the oozing greese will be non existent. Oh and please replace the clip board menu with steel/brass rings instead of a clip, everything kept sliding all over. The food is also a bit over priced, My other half got the presidents salad and thought he said it was good it was really over priced for some lettuce and chicken.

    "text": "I went here alone. I only wanted to sit at the bar and have a beer and burger. Mission: Accomplished.   However, that came with extensive waiting and uncomfortable eye contact with the bartender while he mixed drinks for other tables. They weren't busy but it seemed the staff was overwhelmed.   I decided to sit at the upstairs bar as the 1st floor was 1/2 filled and didn't want to sit next to anyone. The upstairs was slightly empty and plenty of seating at the bar.   I sat there for 10-15 minutes while the wait staff were standing around and talking. No bartender in sight. He returned and made a few drinks and didn't acknowledge me. To me, a simple \"I'll be right with you\" would have been sufficient. Towards the end of making a few drinks he acknowledged me (right before I almost left).  Once I was waited on, the experience took a turn for the better. The bartender asked what I wanted... now keep in mind, the drink list is large. It can be a bit overwhelming. I asked the bartender his recommendation, gave my specifics and he delivered. It was perfect. I tried a few additional samples to make sure. I'm not sure what beer he chose and I didn't ask.   I requested a food menu and skimmed it for a few minutes. I decided to start with an appetizer. I ordered the Mozerella Cogs, these are amazing, highly recommended. Shortly after my burger came (perfect timing, i had a few minutes to relax before the burger). I ordered the Management Burger, great burger, cooked perfectly. I ordered this without mushrooms and onions and left the bleu cheese and bacon. The bleu cheese was too much and that's all you could taste. Towards the middle of the burger I needed to scrape some of the cheese off. Other than that, it was a very good burger. The fries were amazing!  Overall the experience was not what I was expecting but the food and beer made up for the lack of customer interaction.",

I had the smoke stack hand held sandwich and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing really and kinda messy. But it did taste good. My wife had the fish and chips and said she like it just fine.  They have a good selection of beer on tap and I made the most of my opportunity. I tried a few of the house beers and liked them both. One thing I do really like is that they use the digital pour app. It's a great app that shows you what is on tap, how much each beer costs, and how much is left in the keg! Really like that!  Anyways, the food was decent as was the service. Might stop by again if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "This parking lot is littered with places to watch games and enjoy time out with friends. There's a Tilted Kilt and Quaker, Steak & Lube (and even a Max & Erma's). We walked in to Industry Public House because it was local rather than a national chain. Meanwhile, expecting a sports bar, it was clear that wasn't the case here. On a Friday night, March Madness was on, the restaurant was packed and not a single person inside was watching any of the games on the big screens.   Industry Public House is a a place middle age people come to socialize. We walked in wearing sweats and sports hoodies (to watch games) and were more than out of place. The crowd was mostly mid thirties to mid 50s and well dressed, not dressed in a fancy way, but much nicer than casual. This is a place to be seen, to enjoy a stretched out dinner or drinks with friends or for a special occasion, rather than a quick bite to watch a sporting event. There's a few TVs but many aren't placed in areas that are conducive to watching multiple games. Alcohol and conversation is more important. If you're trying to avoid the 18-25 year old crowd you'll likely accomplish that here.   Industry brings many things to the table; great service, an inviting, upbeat atmosphere, large flat screens and better than you'd expect food. In fact, the food here blows away that you'll find at the competition. I expected to pay more for the atmosphere and quality of food. Meanwhile, it's well priced.   The menu isn't geared toward entrees, rather appetizers, burgers and wraps, all of which taste like they're prepared in house with quality ingredients. Take the wings for example. They are made with fresh, premium chicken and are well seasoned. You won't find the traditional heavily breaded wings, rather lightly breaded and lots of meat. The sandwiches and burgers are made to impress as well. Do try the Model T Turkey that comes with fresh sliced turkey and the Reuben. You can't go wrong.",

    "text": "NOT the place to book an event!! I am so, SO disappointed that we chose to have our annual staff Christmas party at Industry Public House in Robinson!! The whole process, including the party itself, was a disaster and, as the person \"in charge\" of planning the party, I am embarrassed.  The manager that I worked with, Colin, let me know during the initial phone call that he preferred to communicate through email. The only problem with that is, he rarely responded to my emails until I sent him a \"reminder\" email, which was a bit frustrating.  We booked the upstairs bar area and chose to go with the 7 appetizer package at $17/person. TWO DAYS prior to our event, we were notified that there was another party booked in the upstairs bar area for earlier in the day and they were worried that they would stay longer, so they asked if we would move down to the \"Sunroom.\"  There is no bar in the Sunroom, so I inquired what the bar service would be like. Colin assured me that we would have SEVERAL servers that were \"well trained in serving large parties.\" When we got there, we had TWO servers for 45 people!! Several guests told me that when they got tired of waiting for a server and went to the bar themselves to get a drink that they were \"scolded\" by the bartenders who told them that they should be ordering from the servers - this made me very angry. I was a server for YEARS and I just know that this is so unprofessional. You do not treat paying guests this way!!!  To add insult to injury, when the server brought me the check for the food, I was appalled! We had 45 confirmed guests, 2 of which ended up not coming, so I assumed our number was at 43. They told me that they had counted 54 people and were charging us for that!! When I objected to this, the server got a bit \"snippy\" with me and told me that they had counted twice. At this point, I was so frustrated, that I explained the situation to one of my colleagues and had him go talk to her. Several minutes later, she apologized, saying that perhaps they had accidentally counted people from another party. She charged us for 45 people and we paid the tab. Not long after, she approached me again and said \"I don't mean to be pushy, but that price did NOT include gratuity.\" If you've ever planned an event for a large group like this, I'm sure you know that gratuity SHOULD BE included in the price. Then, if the servers do an outstanding job, you tip more on top of that, which, as a former server, I always do.   The food itself was NOT worth the $17/person that we paid.  The flatbreads were very good, but the pot roast French fries were not very good and were certainly not appealing to look at. The boneless wings left a lot to be desired and were overly spicy. The best part was the truffled popcorn, but it disappeared rather quickly.  As you can gather from my review, I will NOT be returning to this establishment for any reason. I don't like to write reviews like this, but I feel like I needed to do this as a public service. Having worked in the service industry for years, I completely understand that sometimes you can have an \"off\" night, but, unfortunately, this was not that. A True disappointment.",

The bartenders were very friendly and the service was crazy fast. We had Valeria as our bartender/server.  They have tons of beer on tap. They have these amazing whiskey drinks that they make using fire and various flavored wood chips. We didn't try one but we heard others saying how good they were. The passion fruit kicker wheat beer was very light and tasty. They let you taste a sample before choosing if you prefer.   Appetizers: if you don't try the candied bacon you are missing the best thing on the menu. WOW! It's unbelievably delicious!   Dinners: they don't have a huge selection, so don't expect pages of options. They had about 10 things to choose from. My friend had a burger and said it \"was ok\". I ordered the smokehouse sandwich. It was strips of steak (similar to a Philly cheese steak), aged white cheddar, horseradish sauce, and arugula on sourdough toast. It was very tasty and extremely filling. It had the perfect amount of ingredients. The sandwich was served with a side and I chose sweet potato fries. They were sweet potato waffle fries with cinnamon and powdered sugar on them. Wow they were delicious!   Overall, extremely good and looking forward to going back again soon.",

I do have to give special mention the Blast Pig burger, which was really awesome and probably what I will get from now on. It really had some unique toppings that went well together.   Service is usually alright. Nothing to write home about. Overall, it's a good standard place where you know what you're gonna get. Always good to have a few of those in your arsenal :)",

Two pages of beer, a page of whiskeys and bourbons...scotch....a pretzel the size of your head.  For drinks, I ordered two house made items.  The Copper Ale, and the House Rye Whiskey.  The copper ale was one of those beers that has flavor but not too heavy.    The house Whiskey was interesting.  Surprisingly good flavor reminiscent of a Balvanie scotch, but does finish showing its three year age (a burn).    Great experience, fast service, and a unique atmosphere, which for those who like eating out, is difficult with all of the chains.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch today with my wife while I am in town on business.  Decor and atmosphere were great! Lots of TV's and the visual peek into the brewery pipeline was interesting.  Was early for lunch and while there were few others present, we were seated right next to a table with a large group.  I should have asked to move but did not.  Food quality:  so-so.  I had the honey ginger wings and a cup of chilli.  The chilli was good but a bit sweet.  The wings were really nothing to brag about...not even sure I could say they were as good as B'dubs as they were a bit skimpy and lukewarm.    The wife had a chicken salad sandwich which was on special today, however, the waitress (Jessica) brought out a grilled cheese sandwich.  My wife who doesn't like to complain told me she'd eat it anyway but I convinced her not to eat something that she did not order. The waitress came up to our table at that point and apologized when I questioned her whether this was a grilled cheese or chicken salad. She immediately took back the plate to the kitchen and said that \"they probably just moved the plates around in front of me and i did not notice.\"  Finally, she brought out the right plate (as I was finishing my lunch up) and my wife indicated while the sandwich was good, the fries on the previous plate were much better than the current version as they were soggy and barely cooked.  After the waitress picked up the plates, she slapped the bill down and said \"ok, pay me when you're ready.\"  Jessica is probably a nice person who was having a bad day but the appearance of apathy and lack of caring in doing your job and being cheerful to a new visitor to your business is essential.  I tipped her almost 15% based on the benefit of the doubt, as I usually tip 20-25% and hate to not leave a tip unless the service was unbearable.  Not sure I'll be back as I'm only in town a few days...the bar area looked interesting and a place that I could spend a few hours at post-workday, though!",

    "text": "One of the better options I've had so far in Pitt.  I've been here several times as I am temporarily in the airport area until I fully relocate.  The drinks are tasty, the beer selection is AWESOME especially if you like porters and more hearty ales.  I've tried a couple porters here that were just deeeeeelightful.  And the one bartender with the dark hair and beard (sorry, I forgot his name!!) was so spot on in giving me suggestions for beer.  The food is pretty dang good too and the staff is friendly.  It is LOUD though sometimes so be prepared for that, especially when it is busy - the acoustics in the place just amplify the heck out of the crowd noise.  I love that they play various sports on the screen, not just football.  And the setting is very trendy instead of boring or divey.  Wish there was another Industry location in Pitt (hint hint, north side?)  The spot where I didn't give it full stars was the pricing.  It seemed pretty expensive for some of the burger options - and given the lower salaries in this city, it feels like I am paying for a Seattle-based burger brewpub instead of Pitt.  I have lived in so many cities in the past couple years where I got to enjoy extended happy hours so it bums me out when I can never make it to the happy hour here.    Also, I wish there was a small bites menu offered all the time to help offset the cost of the entrees because I would eat here more often if there was.  For example, if I could get just a burger with no fries and save myself $3 that would be pretty sweet.  Or a soup option with small pretzel... just wishful thinking.",

Our waiter, whose name I don't know because he never introduced himself, provided poor service which really ruined the whole lunch. Although the restaurant was far from crowded, he never checked on us. After taking our orders almost an hour passed before he came back to tell my friend they were out of what she had ordered, leading us to wonder if he had ever even put her order in to start... I ordered some kind of fancy grilled cheese sandwich which doesn't appear to be on their menu anymore and the food was awful. There was hardly any cheese on my sandwich and it was dry. The fries were SO salty I gagged on them, it tasted like I bit into a block of pure salt. I asked the waiter to bring the manager but eventually had to go find him myself. At least they were nice enough to not charge me considering I didn't touch my meal, but the waiter never apologized nor did he remove my meal from the table after I told him I didn't want it. Hopefully that waiter isn't working there anymore...",

The menu options forced us into tough decision-making! Anything with bacon is highly recommended. It was meaty and flavorful not greasy or fatty. My boyfriend got the fish and chips and the fish was falling off the plate it was so large. Nicely battered and good flavor.  The wait staff was fine, not overly attentive, but enough.  Looking forward to trying more of the menu.",

The bartenders always make an effort to chat with you a bit and get to know you. I'm not sure if we could be considered 'regulars' but I feel like we are when they remember us even if it's been a while!   The food at IPH is also really delicious.

Finally made it out to Robinson and I was rather happy with my experience.   On a Saturday afternoon, there really weren't too many people there so we were able to get a table in no time. The space is large and well decorated with a modern atmosphere. The menu wasn't all too varied and it seemed that sandwiches and burgers dominated the menu, but each seemed to be loaded with a variety of different toppings that made it a very tough decision. Everything sounded delicious but I had to settle with one item so I got the Eliza Chicken and the hubby got the Worker Burgher. After a bite of each of these, I've come to realize that any bite of their food is an explosion of flavor! Bold, spicy, and what you'd expect to be served at a hip gastropub. The chicken on the Eliza Chicken, however, was a tad bit dry and rather thin. The sandwich seemed to be dominated by the toppings rather than the chicken, which probably attributed to the explosive flavor so it was enjoyable nonetheless.   I think this was a good addition to the Robinson area. I will definitely be back, as I hear their brunch is out of this world as well as their drinks!",
