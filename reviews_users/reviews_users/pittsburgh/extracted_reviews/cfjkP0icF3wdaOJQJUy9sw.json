That is also a good sign, shows that the place has staying power with the constant line of people inside and outside wanting their food.  Bad thing, traffic can sometimes be snarled if there is that big of a line that it comes out onto Baum Blvd.  Quick sidenote: if you decide to use the drive-thru, be sure to have used the bathroom prior, not fun to sit there waiting when you really need to use the facilities.

They didn't try to upsell me or read me the rule book when I asked for extra hot chili sauce (my favorite hot sauce of any fast food chain) and crackers like the Wendy's at home.

Giant glass windows give a peek inside to the revamped interior, complete with the fancy-schmancy create-your-own-Coke machine.

    "text": "Perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown Balto that I may have a skewed opinion, but anyone who tries to say that this location has shady patrons is woefully incorrect.  As of today, I have gone to this location throughout every part of the day.  Today, sunday morning, I walked into the fast food joint while half the restaurant was blocked off for prospective vibrant wendy's employees training.  their overplayed commercial promoting their breakfast, specifically their \"fresh cracked eggs cooked on a griddle\" thing, finally inspired me to wake up before noon for the first time in a while to head to wendy's for breakfast.  I got the artisan egg sandwich with sausage combo (which includes their roasted potato slices and a drink (OJ costs 80 cents extra)).  I thought that the roasted potato slices would turn out too gourmet, which i was NOT looking for.  But praise whatever you'd like me to praise, they did use a good amount of starch to give it the outside crunch reminiscent of a french fry or a tator tot.  thumbs up to that.  unfortunately, i may have come too late to get the fresh batch of sausage patties, but mine came out a bit dry.  Then why 5 stars? the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburger.  my goodness, it could be the best 99 cent fast food item of all time.  i've ordered as many as 6 at once before, and no more than 1 was made with any type of cheese translational misregistration relative to the sausage patty substrate (did i just reveal my identity as a loser? i hope not). in layman's terms, every little cheeseburger came out constructed perfectly, with one slice of fresh tomato, crisp green lettuce, and most importantly, their bacon.  overall, i'm partially thankful to be in pittsburgh because of how near i live to this wendy's, and because pittsburgh is one of only around four metropolitan areas where wendy's currently offers breakfast. although nothing would ever match up to in n out, this is my go-to place to satiate my cravings i get as a socal fast-food junkie.",

Do NOT support this business!! Police are involved.",

The cashier seemed to keep busy. Good on them.",

There were maybe three or four people waiting for their orders and no one else in line.  We ended up leaving and going to Wendy's on McKnight, which was a whole different can of worms.  Wendy's has gone down hill.",

The most recent time took over 30 minutes and I was only the 4th car in line. No one apologized, no one asked me to park and wait for food, nothing. It should not take 20+ minutes in a drive thru every time.",

We were relatively sure we specified that we wanted a large, but even if we did not, the employee never asked us if we wanted a large meal. Also, when handing us our drinks through the window, it tilted so much that the cap definitely could've fell off.",

It will be very slow... You will sit in the parking lot and watch in amazement as three or four employees sit at tables in the (closed) dining room area and text people. Perhaps they are excited about the nomination they will receive for slowest possible service... Or maybe they are texting the one person in the back and letting them know that they need to get the line moving because traffic has extended onto the street... Make sure you are in the right lane after you pass through the intersection because it is highly likely you will begin your long journey to the order window on the actual street in front of this Wendy's, one star because the order was semi-accurate.",

First, this Wendy's is huge compared to others, and it's really nice inside. However, it's not clean. I couldn't believe that I was pulling my drink lid from a metal sever that had disgusting stains and hair on it. The condiment table was equally nasty with loose lids and ketchup. The dining area did not appear that clean either. Lastly, they have those wonderful virtual soda machines, but many of the options were unavailable. Let's just say I'll probably be sticking to the drive-thru from now on.",

We just left Southside & were driving around aimlessly looking for places to eat. At last we spot Wendys & a drive thru line wrapped around. We wait.. & wait & wait. A few cars leave & we move. & wait some more. Finally we decide to leave after realizing it'll take forever to get through the line. We drive past the window & boom.. It's dark & closed. We look at the Wendys sign which states they close at 6pm new years eve. So a line of 20 cars including us all had a dummy moment the very beginning of 2014, including our DD. haha :)",
