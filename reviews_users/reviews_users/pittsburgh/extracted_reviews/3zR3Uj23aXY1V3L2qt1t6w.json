We received rave reviews from our guests on the quality of the food.  This goes a long way since wedding food usually isn't that good.  Her staff is polite and courteous as well!  They even worked around and provided options for the few guests who had food allergies.  Bravo to Our Little Secret!",

    "text": "We had a late breakfast at this restaurant. I had it bookmarked to go.   It's tucked into a small corner of a shopping plaza. The sign is pink and black. When you walk in there are a few tables to the left. To the right are more tables and some booths. The restaurant is small. The top half of the walls are painted a dark pink-almost plum color. The bottom half is white. There are pictures and quotes on the walls by women like Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn.  There is a bar that you can sit and eat at. I was disappointed to see the laminate tiles falling off of the bar. It made the place seem a bit shabby.  Our waiter was a nice young man. They give you small muffins coveted with cinnamon and sugar to nibble on while waiting for your meal. My son ordered The Chop. It was 2 eggs (made any way), 2 meats ( bacon, ham or sausage, hash browns, and a huge pancake. It was a huge amount if food. He ate 2/3 of his food and brought home most of the pancake and some of his bacon.  I was excited to see Biscuits & Gravy on the menu so I ordered those. I hadn't read the menu but it tells that they come with eggs and hash browns. I ordered my eggs scrambled and they were very good. The has browns could have used another minute or two of cooking but they were also good. I ordered a side of bacon. It was more chewy than crunchy. It could have been used a little more time on the grill as well. After eating the eggs, bacon and hash browns I was full but really ready to dig into the biscuits and gravy. I was saving the best for last. I took a bite and something wasn't quite right. I was trying to figure out what was different. On my second bite I figured it out. They had used sweet Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage. And thought it was supposed to be a white-ish country gravy it was almost brown and tasted like a brown gravy. I was disappointed. I boxed them to take them home to my husband who would eat them.  I would go back again to try a different menu item or two, but I wouldn't rush back.",

    "text": "With all the great reviews, had to give this place a try. They took our order and offered a free mimosa which one of us accepted.  So far so good. They brought our drinks, minus the mimosa. 15 mins later, no mimosa, and no one had taken our order. At the 20 min mark we had to go up and ask for the mimosa...that they offered. 5 mins after that we get to place our order.  Biscuits and gravy. Pancakes. Strawberry crepe with crispy bacon. The bacon came out first, under-done and very flabby.  Biscuits and gravy and pancakes came out next. We wait. And wait. Then someone comes by to ask if we are waiting on anything else. We had to remind them about the crepe that was ordered with the bacon. They come back after checking on the crepe only to inform us that the owner who took our order never wrote it down. At least she wrote down the bacon portion of that order. At this point our coffee has been empty since we ordered food and we are getting a little frustrated by the lack of service and poorly done bacon.  But moving on...I tried to cut into the biscuit. Tried being the word of the day. It was dry and dense and could be used as a puck in hockey. I moved on to my hash browns, only to be equally disappointed.  They still had the crunch of raw potato. Eggs were over medium as ordered so there is at least that.  The pancakes were large and tasted good but the spinach that had not been cleaned off the griddle from another patrons breakfast was embedded in the pancake. And that was very off putting.  We did finally get the crepe and the girl that ordered it said it was good. You can tell they the kitchen was rushing though all the orders since the food was coming out not quite cooked.  Overall I would not return. Poor service. Poor quality of food. It appeared the focus was to sling out food as soon as possible and not ensure it was properly cooked.",

I expected a hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon type place, but the inside is super cute and the food is anything but greasy. I had the chicken and waffles, which is topped with homemade sausage gravy and my fiance had the mixed grill. We couldn't help getting an order of strawberry crepes to share, and they were easily the best I've had. There are so many delicious looking options on the menu, so we will certainly be back next weekend to try our next dish!!",

    "text": "Shhh. Sequestered in the corner of a half-abandoned shopping center off of Curry Hollow Road in a part of Pittsburgh all too many residents pretend doesn't exist squats yet another All-American Diner. Pink, black, and silver accentuate the interiors from ceiling to floor, from stool to counter. Framed pictures of Classical Hollywood luminaries such as Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, and Frank Sinatra ornament the flamingo walls along with stenciled-on quotes from famous people, agreeably reminding me of Bridgewater's Mezza Luna Cafe. On a chalkboard one can view the entire menu.   In overall spirit, my particular brunch at Our Little Secret strongly parallels the one had just 24 hours ago at Waffles INCaffeinated, and that includes uncostly breakfast fare of the uppermost merit. Gracing our paper-cloaked table were escutcheon-shaped plates that held the following dishes: Baltimore Style Eggs Benedict, Peanut Butter & Banana Crepes, and Kay's Chop Special which came with her choice of french toast.   Deja vu? Ya think?  There were differences, however. My Baltimore Style Eggs Benedict came with full-on crabcakes instead of morsels of crab and the tops of each were lightly scorched for presentation. I told our waiter that these crabcakes were better than those served by Baltimore House, a nearby seafood specialty restaurant, and I wasn't just blowin' smoke -- these contained loads of REAL, fibrous crabmeat (are ya readin', Grant Bar?), and showed that great crabcakes don't necessarily have to be comprised of jumbo lump to be worthy (I'm thinking these were either made with special or backfin, both of which are just fine as far as my stomach goes). The outside was crackling, the inside was smooth, rich blessedness, the filler was minimal, and the two of them were had with the usual Eggs Benedict components for just under $11. And while we're walking down this street, let's talk about that hollandaise sauce. Goddamn, I was beginning to think that I'd never find an area restaurant that did one well. As much as I liked 'em, even Original Pancake House's hollandaise failed to tempt me (mom's is still best). Who knew I'd have eggs benedict two days in a row and that both would be glazed with a stunning mutha of a mother sauce? Citrusy, lardy, and dissolute, at first I scraped some of the xanthous gravy onto my fork and knife, savoring the sauce alone, dangerously coming close to ignoring (and it would have been tragic for these beauts to get cold) each gracefully poached egg, both of them bloated with ichorous yolk so sweltry, one wonders how it didn't solidify. Some agile cookery is going on in this kitchen.   Properly saving them for dessert (sez me), the pair of Peanut Butter & Banana Crepes caused me to crave ice cold milk (or more Sierra Mist) with their hard palate-clinging properties and their briny, nectarous, carbohydratic nature. Unlike Waffles INC. where the peanut butter is melded with whipped cream (a chiffon) to keep it from being too rich (as WINC's co-owner Josh confessed to me), OLS doesn't wuss out (not that I didn't love WINC's chiffon). So yes, you'll be drinking lots of liquid with it, but you'll love it. Furthering the richness were the omelete-ish, custardesque, quivering, canary crepes themselves that were sifted with powdered sugar and swollen with the titular contents. \"Ooof!\" I declared after finishing the last one. Who said crepes were dainty, now?   Splintery taters littered our plates like hay that had spilled from the back of a truck, and they were as oily, crunchy, and starchy as the best hash house shredded tubers tend to be.   We arrived around 11:30AM (an hour before closing), and I was initially relieved that we had no trouble finding a booth to sit in, but as I overheard the co-owner complain during our terrific brunch that they weren't doing much business for dinner, I felt somewhat disheartened. As I alluded to at the start of this review, the plaza where OLS resides has a number of empty storefronts. It would be a shame if this cool, bantam canteen closes along with the department store and supermarket before it. So, my sermon to the local foodiesphere on this gleaming Sunday is to let the \"secret\" slip; if your area chuckwagon is too busy to accommodate you on a weekend morn (say Dor-Stop's got a 45 minute wait in effect), drive over to Pleasant Hills for a most pleasant brunch, and be sure to tell everyone in your circle to follow you there. These folks could use the commerce.   P.S. Our Little Secret also caters (duh!), serves cocktails (for dinner only, but they made an exception for a regular who was having a Bloody Mary with his breakfast), and has a interesting \"take out meal plan\" (go to the website for details).",

    "text": "I love this place! I came here for birthday breakfast with my family after reading the stellar reviews on here. Another win for the Yelp community. The food was amazing and unbelievably affordable. One of the great things about this place is that the menu includes pancakes, waffles, french toast, and crepes. I don't know a lot of breakfast places that serve all of those options. Not only do they have each of those options, but there are a variety of options for each. They also, of course, have a variety of savory dishes, omelets, and benedict. We arrived a little after 11am (they are only open until 12:30pm), and the place was still pretty full, but we were able to sit down right away. I ordered the crab cake benedict after reading all the good reviews on here and I was not disappointed. I am a huge fan of hollandaise sauce and not only was this sauce delicious, there was PLENTY of it. The crab cakes were delicious and the eggs were perfectly poached. My dad ordered the french toast because I promised him this place was legit. He usually won't order french toast from restaurants because he is always disappointed, but he gave this his seal of approval, and I have to agree. Delicious. My boyfriend ordered the steak omelet. All I have to say is: wow. This omelet was HUGE and came with big chunks of real steak overflowing out of the omelet. Although they didn't ask how he wanted the steak cooked, he commented that it was cooked perfectly and said it was delicious(I don't eat steak, so I can't say first hand). My mom and sister both got the regular eggs benedict and were similarly blown away.   The only thing I really wasn't blown away by--and this is a personal preference thing--was the crepes. My boyfriend and I split a strawberry cream crepe. The strawberries were delicious and the cream was to die for, but I was just not a fan of the crepe itself. It was a little too fluffy and rich for my taste and didn't have that slight crisp that I have come to appreciate from other favorite breakfast spots in the city. It was very tasty and we ate all of it, it just wasn't my style.   I live in the  south hills and I usually travel into Pittsburgh for a good meal but this place is sure to be a staple in my life from now on. I cannot believe how delicious and affordable this place is. I can't wait to go back and try something new.",

Basically, nothing was done to improve the appearance of this place and although they have been opened up for quite a few years, I can't understand how the owners would not choose to spruce up this place.   Food was okay.... it took forever to get our food and there was only one table of 4 that was being served after we arrived.

But, thanks to other reviewers, I easily found it.  It's a small cozy restaurant--a mixture of booths, tables and counter-space), with nostalgic decor (quotes, photos of long-gone Hollywood).  The kitchen is open, so you an hear the conversations behind the counter.  Some of the inside could be spruced up, but I could care less if the food's good.  I had the sausage gravy and biscuits, which I'm certain is an entire heavenly stick of butter, and more calories than I need in a day.  It was amazing. I could taste the sausage seasonings (was it sage?), and the biscuit was fluffy and perfect. My eggs were scrambled perfectly, and the hashbrowns were actual potatoes that I'm fairly certain are more fresh than frozen. My MIL had a strawberry crepe, which was stuffed with delicious cream cheese, and actually a crepe!  Coffee was standard, but hot and refills were timely.  Service was quick and pleasant and prices were fair.  In the end, I'm still thinking about my breakfast, and am definitely returning!  I have an entire menu to explore!",

Enjoyed every bite of my chicken fried steak with hash browns, 2 eggs, sausage gravy, and biscuit. Wife had, \"the usual\" 2 eggs, pork sausage, fries, and toast. Couldn't leave without trying one of those \"pantycakes\", and MY GOODNESS that was an awesome pancake. Food was delicious, staff extra friendly. Being my wife, 2 year old, and myself were the only ones there it was a nice experience. They also have a food truck that roams the local area for lunch at businesses. Some pics above don't do this place justice. Will return with new guests to expose this gem.",

I went with the southern belle which is hash browns eggs ham and biscuits and gravy. While the flavors were good I found it very salty. I finished off several glasses of water while eating my meal. I also didn't like the hash browns. They were shredded potatoes overly salted and had no crunch. I wish they had a home fry option. The biscuits and gravy were also very salty. I really enjoyed the texture of the biscuits. The sausage I believe was made in house and was very good but to salty. The little man had a waffle. It was as big as his head. I stole a bite and it was very good. Made me with I would have ordered one. I would come back here. Hopefully it was just an off day. Maybe I'll order a pancake or waffle to cancel out the salt with some sweet next time.",

For $2.99 I got the secret deal, which is for any two sides. So, I got two eggs and hash browns, which was more than a fare price. The hash browns could have been more crispy, but now I'll know to ask in the future. Overall a nice place, with decent food and no wait to get seated. They do have limited hours and some items on the menu are a bit pricey. The coffee was pretty good. Overall, I'd probably give them a 3.5 if I could.",

I had the big breakfast (I forget what it was called) with two eggs, hash browns, sausage, bacon, and a strawberry crepe. The crepe was one of the tastiest I've ever had; fluffy filling, fresh strawberries, and a perfectly cooked exterior. The rest of the breakfast was very good as well, though I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage patty, as it tasted like it was made from bratwurst type meat instead of a more typical breakfast sausage. The bacon was slightly over cooked but still good. My daughter had one pancake which was very large and made fresh, not nuked in a microwave. My friends both enjoyed their meals; I can't remember exactly what they had but I know both of them had meals that included biscuits and gravy, and both complimented the biscuits for their freshness and the gravy for its heartiness. Definitely a great spot to catch breakfast, I'll be returning!  -Update- This is a regular spot for me and my daughter to have breakfast together. The staff is always really friendly, the food always comes out quickly and tastes great. It's a cute little spot and we love it!",

My boyfriend and I arrived here on a busy Sunday, we happily waited a good 20 minutes, the place is small and it's understandable. There are larger booths on one side and just a few 2 seater tables. After waiting 20 minutes we were finally next and there were 3 counter seats and a booth available, I preferred to sit at a table of some kind so we waited. A group of 3 arrived behind us about 10 minutes after we had waited and they were offered the booth before us. We were told we would have to sit at the counter, or wait for another 15-20 for one of the 2 top tables. I can understand this as the booths fit more people... but we also saw another 2 person couple sitting in a larger booth and there were 3 seats at the counter available... why wasn't the 3 party group told the same thing? Begrudgingly we took the counter because we didn't want to stand around waiting anymore. Took another 10 minutes to take our order at the counter, then waited another 15 minutes to be told that what I had ordered they didn't have an ingredient for it so I needed to pick something else. I didn't because I had actually gone here wanting this specific dish. We were offered barely an apology for all the inconvenience and were promptly ignored when my boyfriend who still got a meal was trying to ask for syrup. Another couple at the counter finally offered theirs. Wish I could say I could review the food but was so angry I didn't eat and somehow our check was still $25 for only his breakfast and an orange juice. Never. Again.",

Our group had a Rueben sandwich, a turkey and bacon ranch sandwich, crepes Oscar and a buffalo chicken salad. All were excellent. The crepes had lump crabmeat, asparagus and cheddar cheese ( instead of the usual Swiss) with hollandaise sauce on top. Excellent! The turkey sandwich had thick slices of real turkey breast which were sauteed and delicious bacon, lettuce tomato and a little cup of ranch dressing. Delish! The salad was fresh and plentiful with grilled buffalo chicken, plenty of cheddar cheese and French fries on top (it's a Pittsburgh thing). The Rueben was toasted beautifully and filled with corned beef Swiss and sour kraut. Great! Fries were very thin but tasty. On the YELP app it says they are open until 12:30. Lucky fir me I decided to call and hound out they are open until 1:30 PM Monday through Friday. You won't be sorry!",

    "text": "Recently tried this place for breakfast. We arrived and were seated immediately which was a plus. Unfortunately, the table was up against a wall with holes in it, it looked janky. The first thing we saw menu wise was the small catering menu with a note that it is Cash only, but will allow a charge to a credit card on catering orders. When the waiter arrived we asked if there was an ATM near. Another waitress interrupted and Said \"yes but they charge you to take money out, so it's the same $2 charge for us to do it here too. It says right on the menu that you can use your card.\"  Well seeing how the only menu we had were specifically catering options we thought her response was a bit rude. Our waters came with what appeared to be soil or oreo crumbs in scattered all over the bottom of the glass. We ordered chicken and waffles and biscuits and gravely. They were good, but nothing that I can't make at home.  A little unclean and decent food, I don't see what all the positive reviews are for. My main compliant still is a $2 charge for using a card. It's 2019... get a square reader already. Customer would be charged an extra 20-30 cents instead of $2 for what I consider BASIC service to be offered.",

I was suspicious because there wasn't a name on the truck but after I inquired.. it was understood.  The menu.. it was tough to decide because I got a glimpse of the wings and they looked delicious and liked the flavors in addition to the standard buffalo (such as honey sirchia etc.)  I am a steak lover so was sold  - especially when I read it was served on manicnis hoagie roll!   It's really served on the \"special\" hoagie roll which is a little bit smaller than the standard hoagie size mancinis roll.  The philly was $9 bucks and was totally worth it.  The meat was overflowing with waves of delicious-ness.  I was pleased that I was able to get the sandwich \"without\" mushrooms (because they are MY enemy) the horseradish cream sauce had just the right zing to it and wasn't overbearing in flavor.    The baked potato for $3 bucks:  It was small in size but good.  I got a dollop of the avocado salsa.. it was such a small amount. I wish I would have gotten two instead of one.  I will no doubt be back to sample the wings and tacos...  Thank you \"Our little secret cafe & catering\"",

    "text": "So, they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day...  this place seems to agree.  Small location, maybe fits 20 people max. Menu has all you can ask for at a breakfast place: waffles, pancakes, eggs every way, etc.  It was my last day in Pittsburgh, so I decided to go \"all out\" and went with the French Toasts, with a side of sausage.  Coffee was served, server says the order will be ready soon and out comes this massive plate filled completely by 4 huge, thick French Toast, and a sausage patty the size of a guy's hand.  You must imagine my face of surprise...  How in the world am I gonna eat all that?  (FYI... the picture does not do it justice)  As if the server knew what I was thinking, he comes out of the kitchen and says \"we have a rule, whoever doesn't finish their plate has to help with the dishes\".  I raised my hands, and said \"bring out the gloves because I'm not even going to attempt it\".  It was a fun exchange of words while he poured more coffee in my mug, which was always kept full.  The French toasts reminded me a little of the PAM commercial with the \"ghost of dinners past\".  They had a touch of salty taste, of a griddle that has seen a lot of busy days.  Don't get me wrong, they were good but, don't expect a clean sweet taste here, which is fine with me not liking things too sweet.   The sausage wasn't too greasy, which I appreciated, and after eating 1.5 of the 4 French Toasts and 14 of the sausage, I was done.  Thankfully they let us pay, without me having to touch the kitchen or a dirty dish.   If you find yourself here, remember to share... The pancakes, as I saw at the table next to us, come in 4s too.   Or, order an egg dish, these seemed more \"normal\" size and looked good!   One thing is for sure, you will start your day full and ready for whatever it brings after having one of their breakfasts.",

They have a ton of breakfast options to choose from, and the coffee was great. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet with came packed with ham cut off the bone, not just bagged diced ham. They use Mancini bread, although my bread snob wife says the cinnamon raisin was definitely Jenny Lee. Either way, it was good. Her poached eggs were a little slimy for her liking, but at least they offered freshly cut strawberries and a huge side of ham. Would recommend this to anyone in the area who doesn't like chain restaurants.",

The only way I found it was because of a reference to the Dunkin' Donuts out by the main road.   Once again Yelpers steered me in the right direction. What a great breakfast place (closes at 12:30). A creative menu that is very well prepared. I had the Eggs Benedict Baltimore style which substitutes Canadian bacon for... Crab Cakes. Delicious! The eggs were poached perfectly (not watery or underdone, but with soft yokes) and the crab cakes had a good deal of crab held together well. The hollandaise was a little sweet, but was still very good.   On a Wednesday morning, business was steady, but there was not wait at all. They apparently do a good catering business as well. This place definitely goes on the \"go to\" list.",

I selected the Gobbler and intended to just eat half.   I. Couldn't. Stop.   The avocado really made that sandwich amazing. And it was perfectly stacked & easy to eat on the go.   Wonderful customer service - so friendly and quick! Kudos! I'll be looking for you guys to be out and about more this Summer. Thank you for being so great.",

I don't eat the potatoes and toast with the breakfast entree, so I am thrilled when a place will give me a substitute without an upcharge.  I was able to get some lettuce and tomato slices.... so that right there is worth four stars to me!  But wait, there's more!!!  I tried the cordon bleu omelet and Omgoodness!!!!!  First of all the eggs were perfectly cooked, the ham inside was sooooo good!!  Then there was asparagus and Swiss cheese inside!  The omelet was topped with hollandaise sauce too!!!  It was delicious!!  They have so many interesting combinations-I will be back!!  Your secret is out, you are a great place!!!",

The service was really friendly, we sat at the bar because no tables were open (they're very busy!). They also had outdoor seating which is nice on nice mornings like today. I got the avocado toast with jalapenos and hot sauce, and sunny side up eggs. I loves the addition of the jalapenos! It wasn't the absolute best avocado toast I've had, it was a little skimpy and didn't have a ton of flavor but it was still really good with the eggs! My mom got California Benedict and absolutely loved it! We will for sure be back.",

It's a really cold day - and there is very little space to stand while waiting for a table.  Folks kept holding the door open and so it was really cold inside.  Cash only - no credit cards.  Menu is big - lots of options.  We got one chocolate chip pancake with peanut butter - it was huge.  I had the Baltimore eggs Benedict - interesting that they came with actual crab cakes on it.  Hubby got steak and eggs.  Steak looked awesome but he said it was bland.  If you are starving this is a great place to go. For me it was ok - nothing truly unique or special - just big.",

I was torn between the Eggs Benedict or Biscuits and Gravy, but I went with the biscuits. They were homemade and tasty!! I loved it! Very filling so you will need a to go box, haha. It comes with a large portion of hash browns and eggs. I really liked the hash browns too. Apparently they also have a food truck which I didn't know about! Cool. The only thing that we didn't know of before sitting down was that it is cash only or they charge a $2 convenience fee is you need to use your card. Other than that, we cannot wait to go back.",

It's decorated very cute and has a combination of booths and tables. Service was prompt and friendly. I opted for \"The Usual\", funny because it actually is the usual that I get at breakfast places. Your choice of meat, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast. My bacon, eggs, English Muffin were all very good. The hash browns had good onion flavor. My hubby got the chicken and waffles. He said they weren't the best he had ever had, but not the worst either. Their coffee is hot and very good which is also super important to me.

All food is made from scratch and is worth the short wait. I had the Mad Mexican omelette, delicious. It was mad when I ate it and even angrier later on . Wife had the breakfast sandwich that is on a brioche bun. She loved it. Both our breakfast's came with hash browns. We also got a Belgian waffle as a side. The portions are large. Wife took half of her sandwich home and I didn't finish my hash browns. The waffle also went home. All the food made for a nice light lunch . The restaurant has approximately seating for 40 inside and I think about 16 outside. Everyone working there were nice and the service was great! I can't wait to return for something from the lunch menu!!",

I'd rather pay the fee than have the place raise the price of each item.   FOOD: Every single item I've ordered from carbs to proteins have never let me down! Each dish is HUGE and comes with a generous portion of ingredients (even avocado which most restaurants like to be stingy with). Some of my personal favorites have been the Cali Omelet, Strawberry/blueberry and cream crepes (minus the weird jam they put under the crepe, it takes away from the delicious flavor). My mouth waters just writing this review.  COFFEE: The coffee is actually good! Not decent, good! I felt this an important part of the review just because it's hard to find good coffee at diners.  SERVICE: Service comes with a smile but you may want to stop by during non-peak hours if you lack patience or are in a hurry. It takes a lot for me to deduct points for service so you will just have to form your own opinions.",
