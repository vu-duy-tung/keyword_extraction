All the ingredients are fresh and the Pretzel bun from SouthSide Pretzel shop is outstanding. Really thinking outside of the box at this place. I received the sandwich and a large coffee for around $6.50--great price for the quality. Owner and chef definitely are following plan A and doing it right. I will be back. A quality sandwich shop is hard to find. Next time I'm going to have to try the meatballs or their soup which I heard is great. Clean and welcoming environment!",

There were two 2 seat tables outside so we sat at one of those. Parker's has a varied menu that is mostly sandwiches-breakfast or lunch/dinner. They offer \"Dormont Dogs\" and a couple of salads. You definitely can't beat the prices.  We ordered the \"Barkley's Golf Swing\" (chicken, provolone, Alabama White Lightening Sauce, and pickles on a hoagie roll) and the Mona Lisa Vito (meatballs, green peppers, onions, provolone on a hoagie roll).   We also ordered the Pepperoni Mac n Cheese.  The Alabama sauce is a mayo based BBQ sauce. It sounds weird but tastes amazing!  It was a great match with the chicken. The meatballs on the Mona Lisa Vito were delicious. Sometimes a marinara sauce can be too sweet but this sauce had a perfect balance.  When my husband went to pay he let them know they had forgotten our Pepperoni Mac n Cheese. It was a good thing since we were full from our sandwiches. They apologized and not only took $2 off of our bill, but gave us a coupon for 2 free Bacon Mac & Cheeses. Talk about taking care of your customers!  It's been awhile since I've had that kind of care. It's one of the pluses of doing business with a small business. One of the best things about Parker's besides the customer care is that they use items like coffee and pretzels from local Pittsburgh businesses.  Stop in and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",

From my first, and only, impression I like the place, and the owner seems like a nice guy - it is great to see people my age (29) who are proprietors of their own businesses, and I really hope this guy makes it.  The decor of the place is really clean looking, and not overbearing...  I had a peanut butter and bacon sandwich on a pretzel bun.  Bacon and peanut butter is a great combo, and it really can't be screwed up, but it can be done better than others, and Parker's achieves that by having really freaking good pretzel buns, and of course the whole primes of the place, steaming the sandwich.  I am I happy there is a plain ole sandwich joint around, and a good one to boot - I plan on being a regular here.  You only wish the place was bigger with more of a kitchen so they could do more, and also it is too bad the place doesn't have a larger seating area.

Besides the fact that they've lots of veggie options, what makes me like them even more is that they serve the breakfast options way past lunch time. You'll get a solid value for money in that, their sandwiches are BIG! I remember when my friend's order came out, we thought at first that the two halves were both our sandwiches! And then mine came out and I was like WOW.. these are good sized portions. I'd recommend Parkers more for a takeaway lunch because although really welcoming, their seating options are limited. Funnily enough, the restaurant flooring is a bit wonky in that, you'll find yourself sliding off the bar stools. I found it so strange that I kept sliding off and kept assuming that the previous night's alcohol had still not worn off but finally reached a point where I had to ask the staff if it was me or whether the floor was actually tilted. And I was RIGHT!! It was and they've never been able to fix it!! They informed me that they're moving soon though.. so look out for an updated location. Lol! But, if you intend to dine in, try to sit at the one table as soon as you enter to the left. It's the only table where you won't slide off or things wont roll off.",

High quality bread, and great coffee.  I know one of the hardest things for a new business is to continue using a high quality product, and I'm confident that these guys understand the importance of this.    Keep it fresh, keep it local, and your customers will continue to come back.    My only complaint is the size of the place, but its a brand new business and a small start is a good start.",

    "text": "This is a review for breakfast.  The place is clean and the people are friendly. The coffee, which is Zeke's, was very good.  While they have simple eggs on the menu, the breakfast menu is predominantly sandwiches.  In addition to the speciality sandwiches you can make your own with a variety of toppings.  I debated only giving 3 stars since I thought my sandwich was just okay, but my buddy really liked his breakfast sandwich, he said it was excellent, and I can't give it 3 1/2 stars.    So why wasn't my sandwich great? It starts with the bagel. The bagel was soft, I suppose I could have asked for it toasted but that wasn't offered as an option, and it tasted like a bagel you would get at Giant Eagle, not a real bagel. The cheese on my sandwich was melted on to the bagel and not onto the egg - not a big deal but not the way I prefer it. I had avocado on my sandwich (at a $0.50 up charge) and the avocado slices were quite small to the point that I could barely taste it.  Net, net, the food was good but not fantastic. The price point at about $5 per sandwich is certainly reasonable. If I'm in Brookline and in need of breakfast, I would certainly go back. But I don't think I would make a special trip to Brookline for these breakfast sandwiches.  I'll have to give them another try for lunch, maybe that's where they will really shine.",

Mostly we just sit at the bar as the two of us but we brought my group of in-laws one Saturday for lunch. They're from out-of-town and really enjoyed the ambience and food. It's a great place to bring a group because everyone can find something they like from breakfast sandwiches to Mac and cheese. My favorite is the classic everything bagel and cream cheese.   You have to get the lemonade! They make every order fresh! It's soooo good!",

I've only been in one time when another customer was disappointed with a wait time (however it was a busy Saturday and it was obvious they were backed up...honestly in my opinion if you see a place is busy..assume it's because the food is great...and EXPECT to wait for good quality food) but the owner quickly came out and offered them free items and coupons for the \"inconvenience\".

Very nice people work here. We went here with our 2 little kids and one of the guys (asked first too!) offered the kids Twizzlers.   Would definitely come back!!!",

Bonus points for them using my favorite kind of pasta and just everything together just came together perfectly.  Best thing of all - THE VALUE!! So surprised how inexpensive it was to enjoy such an amazing meal. Love it and will definitely visit again if I'm back in Pittsburgh.",

I tried one of almost everything and I can tell ya everything is fresh and delicious. I'm so glad they've been able to expand in Brookline. Recently we stopped in to pick up our Grubhub order and it seemed there was a little confusion with that ordering system so I would say just call em up if you want to place an order or go in. Seems like they sort of flow better without the 3rd party ordering app. Great place, great food!",

We were told to check this place out when we first moved to the neighborhood and have been nothing but satisfied with the quality of food and outstanding service. If you're looking for breakfast/brunch options or if you are in the mood for lunch/dinner, Parker's has plenty of choices for both. My personal favorites are the Kimmy Gibbler and Mia Madre but you can't go wrong with any of their made-to-order sandwiches. They run specials each day that are generally not on the menu, but are also great options. If you find yourself in Brookline, be sure to check this place out!",

It came with banana peppers, but they happily substituted red peppers instead. Came out neat and well-prepared. Tasted very good. Venue is pretty cool too--Pittsburgh theme throughout the restaurant and it's a generally upbeat environment. Service was fantastic--quick and friendly. Chatted with our server/host for a few minutes before leaving and can't wait to visit again. They serve Zeke's coffee, which made for the perfect pick-me-up the morning I went in. Bathroom was fun to visit because of the painted walls (not very often you get to say that).",

It has a real neighborhood feel, and its always nice to pop in and chat.  There is always a specials board and the ones I've had so far have been damn good. I knew I was sold when I read the description for the \"Hugo Stiglitz\"-eggs, salami, cheese, bacon, pickles, and garlic aoili on a pretzel bun. Delicious! Anywhere that puts salami on a breakfast sandwich over the expected ham wins in my eyes.  My only complaint is their hours-not opening until 10am on some weekdays, which seems pretty late for a breakfast and lunch place.",

We went for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The place is small and can get pretty busy so we lucked out with finding a table for 6 people. You put your orders in at the counter and they bring it out.  The breakfast menu has eggs/toast/meat options plus lots of breakfast sandwiches to choose from. I went with bacon, egg and American cheese on an everything bagel.  There is also the option to add home fries to any sandwich for $2 extra.  The food took a long time to be served but we were not in a hurry so no one seemed to mind.  The bagel sandwich was very tasty and filling.

    "text": "Good food but lacking in a couple other very important areas, in my opinion.  Parker's has a nice menu with a focus on sandwiches on various kinds of breads- mostly bagels and hoagie rolls. I ordered the only vegetarian option I saw, the Sweet Sunshine, and my husband ordered the Winnie Cooper. We got our toddler French toast sticks with sausage. My only bone to pick with the food is that I wish there had been at least one other exciting option for meat-free folks. To the best of my knowledge there's only one, but at least it's a good one. We had no complaints about the food or the pricing of the food.  What we didn't enjoy was two things: strangely slow service and some unprofessionalism. We actually saw a patron at a table have to have her food bagged up to go, after checking in about when the meal would show to the table, because she needed to leave and had been waiting so long. When we got to Parker's there were two other tables of folks and both the tables didn't have food. Which I thought was weird. Our experience was that the entire process (being greeted, order being taken, food being cooked and brought to table) took longer than was reasonable for a sandwich place.   I also overheard some folks on the staff (don't know their roles in the business etc) razzing a review they received about, yes, something trivial. As a former food service employee, I totally get it. Customers can be annoying. Maybe I'm being one of them now! But, to me, those conversations, comments, and jokes are not for having in earshot of paying customers.",

The ingredients were fresh, the coffee was great, and the staff was so friendly. Parker's is a comfortable, hip, diner-style spot right on the Blvd. This has absolutely hit the top of my charts, and I'll be returning to try some other items on the menu.   2 things I'd recommend: 1) offer the bagel toasted. Although the sandwich was delicious, I prefer my everything bagel sammies to have a slight crunch. Toasting would do the trick.  2) wrap the bagels in a paper, then cut in half. Having the sandwich somehow wrapped would assist in keeping it together and not fall apart as easily, since the sandwiches are pretty darn fresh.  Since these are my personal preferences, still going with 5 stars. Don't think twice, go to Parker's",

And Parker's delivers on the fact that they provide said pretzel bun and also the ingredients to make a killer sammich!  I've had the mahoney (turkey, bacon, pepper jack, banana peppers, pickles, & white lightening) and switched to a pretzel bun and the annexation of puerto rico (turkey, swiss, sprouts, honey mustard on pretzel bun) for $5.50. Tell me that isn't a fantastic deal!?   If you were around in Dormont for years, you know that this is the former Dormont Dogs. They had fantastic hot dogs. I was devastated when they closed, but thankfully Parker's continues the dog love with a featured one from their old menu daily. Thank god!  There's a ton of different sandwiches to choose from but the sides are limited to around three daily. Usually a pasta salad or potato salad. The real star are the sammies though! There's a small bar to sit at or a few tables inside and when it's warm, outside. It's definitely worth a trek to Dormont to try this gem!",
