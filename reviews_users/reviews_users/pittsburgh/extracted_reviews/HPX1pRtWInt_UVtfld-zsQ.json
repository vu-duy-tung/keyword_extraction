I recently have found myself unable to eat bacon due to the grease, but the way they cook it here, I am able to eat bacon once again!  The BLT wrap and potato soup are two of my favorite dishes, but the roasted beet salad is also amazing.  I've tried something new every time I've gone, and have yet to be disappointed.    As far as baked goods (my personal weakness), I love these cupcakes so much they were served at my wedding.  The snickerdoodle cupcake changed my life.  I love that they are all named after Pittsburgh spots, an endeavor after my own heart.  Overall, I love the atmosphere, friendly service and great food.  I always love to bring out-of-towners here so they can see a little of what PIttsburgh is about... truly great eats and friendly people.",

They'd say \"Don't you want some meat on there?\" Meat just ruins the salty, vinegary, crunchy, cheesy-goeyness of the cheese and pickle combo. Today, for the first time in my adult life...I found a restaurant that has them on the menu. It was delicious, and frankly an improvement on my toasted white bread/white American/dill selections. They used whole wheat and cheddar and grilled them Panini style. Sweet jebus, that hit the spot.  I come to find out that cheese and pickle sandwiches are a 'quintessential British sandwich' How about that?",

Delicious ice coffee (they use Nicholas Coffee) and creative and delicious baked goods.  My only gripe? I wish they had some premade sandwiches or larger sides for quicker service. A salad sometimes takes up to 20 minutes during the busy lunch rush.",

The man that is there everyday (I think he is an owner/manager) is probably one of the reasons why we come back every single day- he is so friendly, funny, & provides exceptional customer service. One day I walked into the cafe and he asked me \"if you know the song on the radio you get a free dessert\"- little things like that make you want to come back. They cold brew their iced coffee which tastes amazing & they always have vegetarian specials which is much appreciated. They have new desserts every single day & offer a huge variety of food. I would HIGHLY recommend this place.",

The Hotel breakfast was brutal and the Post Gazette led me to this little joint five minutes away. First impressions?  Hip, warm, and comfortable with a lot of smiling faces...not something usually seen down here in Florida. Second?  The breakfast bagel was freaking amazing. I see that has been said a few times. It's True. They don't screw around with the ingredients, instead letting them speak for themselves. Ham edges crispy. Big fluffy layers of whipped eggs. Excellent quality cheese.   Also, the coffee smelled so good tht I decided to veer from my norm and opted for a flavored blend. Delicious. As I sipped on Green Mountain at the office later that afternoon, I wish that I could have called in a delivery.   The next day, I worked from the hotel in the morning and then stopped by again to try lunch before heading to the office. Got a steak and cheese sandwich, chips, and some oatmeal moon pie cream cookie....which was staring me in the face and broke my will. Everything was just as good as the previous morning. And the value is amazing.   Finally, it's awesome to see owners and workers that so obviously care about their place, the community, and most of all their customers. Why wouldn't you want to support that?  These are the type of people that are needed in areas that are rebuilding or have potential. Cheers guys. I'll be back on every trip.",

I was on the North Side (not a familiar neighborhood to me) to pick up a package from the UPS hub on my way to work. I hadn't eaten breakfast or packed a lunch because I'm irresponsible like that, so I decided to find a place to stop and grab both. I am so glad this little place was just down the street in the middle of what seems like an industrial park. It's cute and calm inside and has a really welcoming vibe. I had one of the most delicious bagel sandwiches I've had in ages for breakfast, and picked up the bacon and beet salad for lunch. Fabulous! Candied pecans, delicious but not greasy bacon, tons of beets. Big portions too. I'm almost glad I don't live closer because this place could easily wipe out my spending money. I'll find an excuse to come back.",

Yes, the place is cute, but the journey to walk there from the only available parking left me freezing cold and hoping it was worth the effort to go there. The decor is nice, a relaxed coffee shop vibe with a large chalkboard menu that while \"cute\" is very hard to read, even with my 20/20 vision, due to so many options listed and crammed in one space. I ordered a drink (coconut chai latte) and paid & say down with a paper menu to help me decide. The drink was flavorless and made with just a tea bag, not a blended chai mix, as I had expected. I would never recommend ordering that. I added sugar and that didn't even help. On to the food-- They had a lot of sandwiches for breakfast or lunch but I wasn't too hungry, so I opted a cold salad with sweet potatoes. Just one bite in, and I knew it was old. It had to have been made sometime last week. I'm not one to complain, but I truly couldn't eat it. The girl behind the counter offered me a different salad, with quinoa & tomatoes, and it was much better! The girl working there brought over a chocolate cookie (which looked dry, but tasted great!-- I think it was flourless) and it was a nice gesture, that's why I'm giving Chateau 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.",

I am down here now for temporary work at a near by facility for a few months. Part of my job is to find and order lunch for our \"office\". I had called this place A DAY before and asked #1. Was the online menu correct #2. Do you take larger orders? Roughly 10 people. Answers were yes and yes.  I called to order lunch the next day. I got a slight bit of attitude when I stated \"its a little bit of a larger order if you'll be patient with me.\" As I start to list off items (nothing off the menu. no changes or substitutions on anything.) to feed 11 people I start receiving more and more attitude with each item.   At one point I was told \"if you need to place a large order you need to call the night ahead.\" (this is nearly impossible bc in OUR office setting you can't get an order in a day before. Just how our place works.) However, I remained super nice and continued with the order. One of the last items was a breakfast sandwich (that came with scrambled eggs) and just asked for an extra side of scrambled eggs per a co workers request. The guy acted like I was an idiotic douchebag. \"Well thats going to have to cost you the entire price of a breakfast sandwich. This isn't a diner.\"  At this point the order was placed and I let the gentleman on the other side of the phone know \"Just so you know, sir. I called yesterday and asked if you'd take a lunch order for about 10 people and I was told it was no problem.\".... He snapped back with \"well that person obviously doesn't work in the kitchen.\"  First, I don't care. I don't care about your work drama and lack of kitchen help being able to handle 5 salads and 6 sandwiches. *sarcasm*  Secondly, I called the DAY BEFORE TO AVOID this issue and attitude and the staff dropped the ball. I, as a customer, should never have to receive the attitude and heat for placing a lunch order for our crew, especially when I CALLED THE DAY BEFORE to be clear on this issue.   Sadly, our crew will not be returning to have lunch. Its unfortunate that this establishment cannot handle a 'to-go' order for 10 people.",

Although Big Dog has my heart right now, I really enjoyed this place.  To say it's off the beaten path is an understatement. It is off the beaten path, between large warehouses and practically no real retail businesses. Parking was pretty tough and I was actually parked in by a large semi when I came out (RUDE!). So that was kinda a downer. But I get why you do this. You open a business in a place that you hope will build up around you.   I so so so wanted to try the \"cakery\" part of the place, but had to be good for a Biggest Loser diet competition (I know, boooring!). But those heart shaped conversation heart sugar cookies looked adorable! I didn't realize they'd offer a full lunch menu, but was happy to see a wide variety of not only sandwiches, but salads. I choose the cranberry, apple and walnut salad and it was perfect. Tons of fresh spring mix and the strawberry vinaigrette complemented. Great size as well.  I was also happy to see a variety of loose leaf teas and chai. I choose the house chai, which was great and spicy. I'm sorry, but if you're a cafe (coffee house, tea house, etc) you've gotta carry loose leaf these days.   Prices were extremely reasonable with everything I ordered coming in around $10. I do hope they do well, the staffer was very friendly and chatted with me about their hopes for the place and neighborhood. If you're around the area I urge you to check this out!",

They alway have a few gluten free baked goods daily, my favorite are the macaroons.  My only complaint is that food items in cooler that are couple days old sell for the same price as items make to order.  Other than that, Chateau is a reliable locally owned shop and also features a lotto machine if you are feeling like giving away more of your money :)",

I wish I could do it justice in my description, but I'll just say the bacon was crisp, the eggs were perfect and the taste was delightful.  Oh, and the 2nd best part?  My bagelwich plus 2 diet coke cans was $5.51!!!  Where in the world can you find a bargain like that for breakfast without it tasting like river swill?

    "text": "This is a favorite cafe of mine.  I toyed with 4 stars because of the parking situation, but lack-of-street-parking isn't their fault, so 5 stars prevail!  I have had lattes, regular coffee, and tea and it's all awesomesauce at this place.  The breakfast bagel with egg, ham, and cheese is great as a hangover cure a la my college days or a hearty meal that keeps you going all morning.  The baked goods I have yet to try (I was trying not to double-indulge when I was here, but Nutella Cupcake....zOMG, you will be mine!) though I can't image they are anything less than rockstar.  The selection changes daily, so check out their mouth-watering Instagram/Twitter/Facebook posts for what's available that day.  Let's talk atmosphere.  They have a couch with cupcake pillows - adorable. An industrial feel - perfect for the industrial background of the Chateau area of the North Side.  And plenty of open space.  The tables are a little high in relation to the chairs (it's possible I'm just a little short for the tables!) but even still I can happily and comfortably work here for hours.  I'm also digging the Pittsburgh-themed elements, from the names of the cookies to the \"name\" you get when you order.  Instead of giving you a boring number, they hand out cards with pictures of Mr. Rogers, the Duquesne Incline, etc and call that out when your order is ready; sometimes, they'll bring it right to your table if it's a little slow.  Which reminds me, the staff is so friendly and welcoming.  I take forever deciding which latte I want and the gentleman who is always there when I am is gracious and patient.  It's clear he loves the mission of the cafe, because he'll talk about that, the menu, and whatever else with ease and charm.  It's a hidden gem off the beaten path and I don't even feel the need to hide this wonderful place - everyone, come here, just don't park in my spot!",

    "text": "This place is an example of how things can go awry if expectations and experience are out of whack--and not in the right direction.  I visited for lunch today on a bike ride--I'd seen their signs on the path, so I looked them up on Yelp, and saw that most people seem to like them.  I also looked up their menu ahead of time, and saw that they offer soup in a bread bowl and macaroni and cheese--two of my favorite comfort foods with particular appeal at this time of year, when it's getting cooler.  According to their website, they're open on Sat. until noon, so I timed my ride so I could stop by.  Upon finding the place (which took some doing), I walked in and stood by the counter. There were several other customers, and one employee was busy getting their food, and the other (an owner/manager, I assume) was chatting with them (I assume they're regulars).  After several minutes, the owner/manager asked me if I'd been helped, and I told him I hadn't, so he asked me if I'd prefer to eat in or take out, and I told him I'd like to eat in.  He told me I could have a seat and the other employee would be right with me to take my order, so I picked a table and sat down.  The table had a menu at it labeled \"Saturday Menu\" that had the same selections listed as the website.  When the other employee came over after a couple of minutes, I asked her what soups they had.  She explained that they don't offer soups on Sat.  Unfazed, I asked her about getting a sandwich/side combo, and she told me that they don't offer sides on Sat., either.  She then proceeded to tell me that they only offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches on Sat.  (Umm, then why are sides, soup, etc. listed on the \"Saturday Menu?\")  I asked her if she had a recommendation, and she said that she liked all the sandwiches she'd tried.  I asked her what she thought of the muffaletta, and she said she hadn't tried it yet, but since I hadn't ever had one, I decided to order it.  The sandwich came out after a few minutes. According to Wikipedia, muffalettas are traditionally served cold, but can be heated--this one came as a panini.  I thought the flavor was decent, though, as I mentioned, I don't have a standard to judge by.  When I finished, my waitress came by and asked if I wanted anything else.  Since this place is known for their baked goods, I checked what was available, and a cinnamon roll muffin caught my eye, so I decided to get it.  Without asking if I'd like it boxed up for takeout, the owner/manager boxed it up, so I paid and left.  Upon arriving home, I heated the muffin briefly (as the owner/manager suggested) proceeded to eat it.  The first bite was stale and bland, and I couldn't taste any cinnamon.  Even the middle of the muffin contained very little cinnamon--the only saving grace was the cream cheese icing.  Since it was the last one, I'm guessing that the muffin had been sitting around since at least yesterday. As someone who's no stranger to eating several-day-old baked goods, this muffin didn't age well.  Overall, I'm sorry to say that this was a rather disappointing lunch, in light of the lack of selection and food quality.  I'm guessing that the food selection and quality--and possibly also the service--is much better during weekdays.  Unfortunately, I live and work (9-5) in Oakland, so it's impractical for me to visit during weekdays.  While I applaud the owners for opening the business in an out of the way location and for having some weekend hours, I'd advise them to be upfront about item availability on Sat.  If you're only going to serve sandwiches and breakfast items on Sat., then please make a Sat. menu that includes only these items and post it on the website and at the tables.  If you're going to bill yourself as a cakery, then please offer at least some fresh baked goods every day (including Sat.).  As for potential customers, while this place may be worth visiting on weekdays, I'd advise you to stay away on Sat. until the management makes some changes. 2.5 stars.",

The bagel is delicious and real make or break item on a breakfast sandwich. I always have a mental battle between sausage or bacon- but really where is no loser in this choice. Both are great!!!!  The friendly staff is always quick and efficient when taking orders and the wait time is the proper amount one would want to wait.   Great coffee- brewed to perfection.   Chateau is an awesome spot to break bread with a good friend over some good food. I literally come here every Friday for a breakfast sandwich. After trying many spots to get the best breakfast sandwich, this is by far the best and gets two thumbs up from me. (Three thumbs is I had another hand)",

On day I was out with a friend of the family who offered to treat me to lunch for taking her car shopping and I immediately thought of Chateau.   Even though the space is small they offer both breakfast and lunch. Their menu features sandwiches, salads, wraps, a few types of hoagies and even a few soups. They also have a daily special that they post on instagram. But, to be honest I think everyone just comes for their baked goods as the brownies and chocolate chip cookies are out of this world!   Once we arrived and looked over the menu we both chose the CheeseSteak Hoagie. It features fresh chip steak, grilled onions, grilled green peppers, melted provolone, lettuce, tomato and mayo on a Breadworks Hoagie Roll. The steak was tender and full of flavor. The roll was very fresh and tasty as well. My friend loved her hoagie as much as I did.  Once we had finished our lunch we each grabbed a couple brownies and chocolate chip cookies to go to fuel us for the rest of our car shopping day. If you ever find yourself in the Manchester area of Pittsburgh be sure to check out Chateau Cafe. You wont be disappointed!",

Second time I visited I got it right- I came on a Friday morning. This is a really adorable coffee shop and it's located on the north shore, in an industrial park. Parking was easy to find. The cafe is rather large- plenty of room to study or come for a work meeting. The barista was super friendly and sweet. I ordered a large \"Night of the living latte\" which was a seasonal special- white chocolate and raspberry. It was delicious! I can't wait to come back and check out their food- it smelled so good in there!",

    "text": "Last year when I attended Yelp's maker's and bakers holiday party for the entire community I was determined to check out each baker that participated and visit them myself. For some reason I forgot that this place was represented.  With the nightmare construction at the north end of the West End bridge it was a bit tricky finding this place but I managed. It sits right in the middle of an industrial community and believe me there are many places that warn you about no parking. My advice-if driving go off to the residential area and park there because sure enough they do tow!!  The place is small. They serve coffee, various teas, baked goods, breakfast, lunch, and frozen goods from a freezer. The prices are very reasonable-Breakfast seems to focus on oatmeal but they do have other offerings. Today's lunch special was pizza. I decided to go for a breakfast pastry rather than attempt to eat that gigantic slice of marble cake which you can get for just under $3.00 a slice.  So I settled for a cranberry orange scone which was the only scone they had left. The cookies look phenomenal but after learning they bake their own goods in house I went with the scone and a cup of small coffee. Cards are accepted since they use \"square\" as your receipt and of course they have take out.  I got my scone and coffee. It was good and very filling. The coffee was mediocre. I get the impression that this small eatery which is no longer open on Sats. which was noted on a previous review is for the people working in the various tenants of the community who want to grab an inexpensive breakfast, lunch or snack. Staff was friendly and helpful. There are places to sit if you want to avoid going outside and I like the way it is decked out.  This is probably not a place I'd go out of my way for again but definitely worth a visit. They are only open on weekdays until 4.",

    "text": "I would have never even found this place or even thought to come and enjoy a nice tea or sandwich if it wasn't for this YELP.  I loved that the owners were so involved with the community and have a real flair for food. I really enjoyed getting to know them and talking about food and the community at the event. They even said that sometimes they trade food or drinks for garden items. Someone just gave them some herbs in exchange for some food and they took the trade! What a great place that is interested in community not just profit.   Bites:  Caprese salad. This was presented on a skewer with alternating basil, tomato, and then cheese ball. The owners did say that the basil came from their own garden. That was a huge draw for me. If you can use ingredients from your own backyard then this place gets my vote! Capreses salad is simple and easy, and I loved the skewer version of it. I liked it and would get it again.   Bacon wrapped chicken bites. The jerk chicken spice was amazing. That paired with the bacon was drool worthy. I will say that some of the larger pieces of chicken were a little dry, but the other smaller pieces were yum-o. I loved that spice on the chicken!! Honestly, it was great. And the candied bacon...yummmmy. If it just had a tad more kick to it then I would have loved it even more, maybe some cayenne or something. I would get this again though.   Reuben sandwich. Okay, to be fair, reubens are some of my favorite foods. I love the taste of them and will almost ALWAYS choose them if I see them on the menu. These were good. I would say that the sauerkraut did not have the kick that I would usually like to see in a reuben, but these were good for sure. I do think that I would ask for more thousand island if I would order it again.   Desserts:  Cannoli. YES. Thank goodness for these. These were great. There were three flavors and each of them were better than the next. I will say that the filling was more of a cream cheese filling instead of the usual ricotta flavor. I think that it was good, but I would have liked ricotta instead of cream cheese. But the cannoli were mini's so it was a nice little snack.   Brownie. This was a bit much. I mean, I love brownies but this was too much for me to eat. I am not saying that it wasn't good, I am saying it was a lot of brownie for the size. This brownie was dense and filled with chocolate flavoring. AND THEN it was topped with cookie dough. OMG. Could you even ask for anything more than that. Brownie and cookie dough. I think it was wonderful and fun. But it was too much for me to eat. I had to take part of it home. It would not be my choice to get again, but if I shared it with someone then lets do it! Share a brownie and dig in.   I hope that everyone who reads this will go out and pay this business a visit. It was a great time with wonderful owners. The food was fresh and delicious and the drinks were refreshing and cold. Yum. Come visit, you will not be disappointed.",

The owners we very gracious hosts, providing a special experience. This is a very nice space to rent for a private function.   This sustainable cafe served a hyper delicious assortment of appetizers and desserts: Caprese skewers, Sweet & spicy bacon wrapped chicken bites, Mini Reuben, Brownies topped with cookie dough and 3 types of Cannoli.  I don't have any complaints about the food, I totally enjoyed every bite! I was afraid of  the cookie dough having a raw taste but it was the perfect pairing with the brownie, Rich and chocolatey, oh and the chocolate cannoli had the absolute level of sweetness! The breakfast blended coffee was wonderful with my sweets.  Thanks for enjoyable evening!   I want to give a shout out to Monica from Pop Craft for the fun watercolor craft!",

Each guest is assigned a Pittsburgh landmark or celebrity. I've gotten Pittsburgh Dad and Phipps Conservatory to name a few. . sandwiches wraps salads breakfast or lunch. Often some prepared things in the cooler for purchase, like couscous with chickpeas, basil and tomatoes. Diverse fruit cups with strawberries blueberries raspberries and grapes are pretty affordable!

I immediately started thinking of the Great British Baking Show and trying to remember all the things they said about sponge cake, because I think they were all here.  The frosting was rich and not too sweet - a simple & delicious dessert!  Not everything is available every day and I was disappointed to find out it was not a meatball hoagie day, but everything I had was tasty, so I didn't have a problem switching to a reuben.  The reuben was very good - not the best I've had, but a good reuben with very fresh tasting pastrami.    Roasted beet, bacon, nut and cheese salad with house-made balsamic?... that was amazing!  If the combo of ingredients sounds good to you, definitely get this.  It was everything I hoped for!    But back to the sponge cake.  I think they rotate baked goods, but if they've got sponge cake available when you go, do grab one.  I got the last piece of the day and didn't regret it!",
