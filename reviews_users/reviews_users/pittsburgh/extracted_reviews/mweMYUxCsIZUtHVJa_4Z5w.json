Dinner choices, you will find something that is not just up your alley but delicious. There were four of us with diverse tastes and everyone was pleased. Their prices are competitive. The only knock is, I have limited mobility and there is not an easy way to negotiate parking or the dinning area. The handicapped spots are right on the road and the rest of the lot is on a slope. Inside is very tight also. That is the only reason i did not give it a five. I recommend off peak if you or someone with you has extra needs.",

If you have to drive a little distance to get there, it is worth the trip. They feature a full bar with a nice rotation of beer selection. Some waitstaff issues, but I will add it was really crowded and they probably could have used another waitstaff member. Other than that, I do recommend that you visit. Very Clean.

    "text": "I was brought to Doridos on Halloween night after trick-or -treating ended, around 8:30pm. My boyfriend and I grabbed the last two seats at the bar, it was pretty crowded with all of the tables in the bar room area taken as well. I also noticed they have a back dining room that began to fill up shortly after we arrived. We were acknowledged quickly by the bartender Aimee. We ordered 2 beers, a dogfish head 60 min IPA for me and a Yuengling for the beau. A different server/bartender took our order when we were ready. I chose the crab cake sandwich which normally comes with fries and coleslaw. I asked if I could substitute a cup of the shrimp and sausage gumbo, which was their soup of the day, for the fries and slaw. She looked at me puzzled and at first responded, \"it normally comes with fries and slaw;we normally don't substitute soup.\" I noticed it was a handwritten check so really she could substitute whatever she wants since she was not limited by the computer system. She must have realized the same and said, \"ok, I'll just say no sides, sub soup.\" (obviously!). I was glad I made that substitution. The gumbo was delicious! Lots of shrimp and sausage with just the right amount of kick to it. The crabcake sandwich was also delicious-all meat and very little filler. And for $8.99 the price could not be beat. I was skeptical due to the price but I was very satisfied with my choice. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and scallops meal, with fried shrimp. The shrimp looked tasty, however, he split a scallop with me and I was very underwhelmed with it. It was rather rubbery and flavorless. It appeared to be prepared in just butter, very plain. His also came with coleslaw and fries. They have a very seafood-centric menu but also have a variety of other options as well including burgers,sandwiches, the typical fried food bar apps. They also always have daily specials and daily soup specials. I'd visit Dorido's again-everything I personally ordered was tasty and priced right plus they had a wide variety of craft beers on tap.",

    "text": "Recently, we were in need of a quick meal and everywhere we tried to go seemed to have a long wait. Hey hubs, \"Remember that place by South Park that we occasionally pass? I think there is a fish on the sign. Wanna try it out?\" When we arrived, there were a couple of people in front of us but we got a table within 5 minutes.  Looking over the menu, my first impression was to get up and run out the front door. The selection was huge and the prices were very small. $4 for s burger? That's scary low. Despite their many specials, I went with the zucchini fries for an app (not to be confused with the zucchini planks). And a steak salad for my entree. Hubs got a sandwhich and we ordered fish sticks for our toddler. The kids meal and app came out quickly which is always appreciated. The zucchini fries were tasty but not served with sauce. We requested marinara and were quickly pleased. Also a big hit with the kiddo. His fish sticks were more like planks, think Long John Silvers, that size. Two in a meal with fries. My entree, steak salad, was also done fairly well. Although it was obviously an iceberg mix, the salad was also topped with some extra veggies even a pepper and an olive. Hubs enjoyed his sandwhich. Overall, Dorido's seems to be a step above your typical bar food or a family style restaurant like King's or Eat N Park. The prices are scary low and the staff is pleasant.",

If Dorido's ever offered a Groupon or BuyWithMe, they'd have to just give away the food because it can't get much cheaper.    I also agree with the praise for the fish sandwich, very tasty, not \"instant-death\" greasy, and a sizable portion.  So the three stars then...the last time we went, we got a weird hostile vibe from the bar staff.  All we wanted were a couple of beers to go with the round of Golden Tee.  I'm sorry that we aren't regulars.  The fact is this is perfect for spot for a low-key lunch or dinner after 18 at the S.P. Golf Course.  Perhaps our experience was an anomaly.  I'd certainly be back the next time we play a round at the course, as it is undoubtedly superior to the snack bar.",

Overcooked clams and worst of all the pre made burger pattie was horrible, no taste, stale bun too.  If this isn't enough, the bartender, who was also serving food spit into some napkins behind the bar!! Yuck!!!!",

You have your basic bar foods & some good seafood entrees. Our friend really wanted shrimp- got 'em & loved'em. My husband got the sweet potato fries which he strongly disliked bc they're cut very thick & tasted \"off\". I had wings that are the typical size nowadays, with good classic buffalo sauce.  Now the bad- out of last four visits (including tonight), over the past year. Our service was awful. Every waitress we have is ABSOLUTELY miserable and rude. The waiters were great, but it must be bad to work there as a woman! I didn't bother mentioning bc I felt uncomfortable & wanted to leave, as we feel like an inconvenience when we are there.",

When we entered, the head waitress breezed by and said, 'sit anywhere.' No hello or good evening. After we seated ourselves, she dropped menus on our table: \"Here!\" They delivered my wife's dinner to someone else and vice-versa and when we pointed it out she made a huffy breath and acted annoyed with us (no 'sorry Ma'am') had the runner grab the dish from beneath someone else's nose and drop it on our table -- you don't do that in an actual professional restaurant. Later she called out across the dining room -- \"want another beer?\"  This woman who told us to sit anywhere acted beyond annoyed that she had to wait on us ... or anyone else. Hope she's annoyed by the justifiably crappy tip I left her: \"Here!\"   Amateur hour. Not going back, not ever.",

This dining experience was way below par from start to our abrupt finish. I ordered a martini with a twist and received one with three olives. Not only that, but while making the trip from the bar to the table the waiter  spilled half of it. The fried cauliflower appetizer was cold in the middle and arrive about 1 minute before our entrees. When the entrees were dropped, one was wrong and we didn't have silverware. I had to get up and find someone to bring silverware. The fish and chips was close to the worst I've ever had. When I had to track someone down for more water that was all I could really take of the whole experience.   I tried to talk with three people on our way out, but the two waiters didn't really care. They just said, \"sorry,\" and walked away. When I approached the bartender/ owner (I think) he had no idea how to handle a complaint in a professional manner.   I hear this place used to be great, but at this level of quality and service I don't see them in business for much longer.",

    "text": "EDIT - I upped this to 4 stars, should be 4.5, compared to every local and non chain place the food and prices here are hands down the best.  The following is an honest review I had written early, but despite my one time bad experience with service, go there.  Dorido's restaurant has been around for fifty years. I like the food there, I really do. I have seen in some reviews patrons didn't like the burger, but I do.  I get take out a lot. If this review was based solely on the food, it would have a 4.5 - 5-star rating, but this review is based on my dining experience.  It's lent. I get it. And I wanted a good meal that I knew was consistent. So where else better to go for fish than Dorido's. After feeding the grandkids a four o'clock supper, at 8:15, I toted them, along with my daughter for Dorido's. I knew it was going to be busy, It was Friday and it was Lent. So we went late.  We didn't have long to wait for a table, maybe 10 minutes. The host was friendly, but the place was packed.  After being seated, a younger, goatee waiter walked by the table, exclaiming, \"Jesus!\", somehow I don't think he was praying.  We had the singing waitress, seriously, she sings all the time. She is exceptionally friendly and upbeat and good. She took our app order, drink order, then food order. The stuffed mushrooms came out after 8 minutes, and the food, although the kids swore it took forever, really came out fast.  Everything was delicious. I especially liked the Ranch dressing, it was housemade. I can't complain about any of the food and the portions were plenty.  Again, singing waitress was great ... until she brought out our food and that was it. This seems to be a pattern, no matter who is our server when we go. They bring the food and I don't see them again. We didn't see her again. Wait, I'm lying. She walked by and I asked for more tarter sauce. she got it. That was it. At that point, I believe they moved her elsewhere and we became a community wait staff table. whoever could get to us would. Noone refreshed our drinks, no one asked if we needed anything else, nothing. We finished our meals and it took fifteen minutes to flag down a server for take out containers, then another 8  minutes to get the check from a totally different server.My daughter had to take the kids outside, they were getting restless, plus we felt uncomfortable because people at the bar were making comments about the kids. And my grandkids were very well behaved.  I thought this was a family place? It wasn't our fault that it was after ten. We would have been out of there by 9:40, before the chatter about the kids, had someone come over to check on us,  I will say this ... five people a bill of 58.00. You can't beat that.  I'll go back, simply because the food is good and the price is right. If I sit inside, I'll go when it's less busy.",

I had to get up several times to find a server to help, had to get my own napkins, never got refills on water until the end of my meal, was not served tartar sauce with my fish meal and waited 10 minutes til I finally had to get up to get a server.  What was worse.....all our food including appetizers, salad and meal all came at once!!  To top it off....the food was horrible.  The fried fish breading was slimy and mushy, the crab cake was burned and the scallops were chewy and lacked flavor.  Honestly, you can get a better seafood dinner or fried fish just about anywhere in Pittsburgh.  To be fair, my daughter did like her shrimp and the wings were pretty good.  We will not go back.",

This place is smaller but adequate which I hear often from the wife. Haa. The broiled fish sandwich was delicious even though I passed on the bun. Trust me I have enough buns on me. The wife had fried fish sammich and I stole a sliver. It too was very good as was the calamari appetizer which comes in 3 sizes and we ordered a medium which was plenty for 4 of us.  The kiddos had a steak sandwich which she only ate maybe half of and the other rug rat had the fish sticks and he said they were really really really good. You can order the meal which throws in some fries and Cole slaw.  I'm looking forward to trying their dinners here and having a drink from the bar which you have to walk through to the dining room.

    "text": "For nearly a half-century, the ever-popular, Dorido's has been serving up grub to the fine folks of South Park Township and the surrounding areas with a hearty pat on the back and a firm handshake. Yet it wasn't until last year that I was made aware of their existence via a hot tip from my father who swears by their tasty fare, which he and a longtime pal of his consider a regular treat after a day of biking in the area.   However, it was Good Friday, and considering that a swordfish is mounted below their writ-large logo, this lapsed Catholic wasn't about to go heathen on yinz.   No, this cozy, cabin-like bar and grill specializes in seafood, oddly enough. One can have Lobster Pots as well as walleye, catfish, and salmon prepared in different ways, but gosh darn it if i wasn't hankering for crabcakes.   I believe I had mine broiled (they can also be fried) and found that the duo of patties were full of luscious, jumbo lump crabmeat and contained little filler. Tartar sauce accompanied the cakes, but a cookbook-perfect remoulade was hidden underneath both, so I barely touched it and the cocktail sauce. Hey, when it comes to crabcakes, it's mother sauces all the way or the highway for me, bub.   Two sides came with my entree, and neither of them disappointed. The baked potato was steamy and colossal while the cole slaw had that tangy/creamy/crunchy alchemy pretty much on lock.   Kay and I shared some fried oysters, and the love affair with the breaded fryolator mollusks was reignited. The coating was applied just enough to jacket each briny ocean blob without turning it into a savory donut, that hot seawater running down my throat as I cracked them open with my teeth, one by one.   The service was on-point, and the clientele were as friendly as they were lively. As I alluded to earlier, and as evidenced by a couple of drive-bys, Dorido's is never lacking in commerce (the parking lot is almost full...always! We barely got a spot ourselves!), so there was a ten-minute wait for a booth.   A sneaky octogenarian tried to steal it from us only to reveal that he was kidding. \"Hey, but let me eat with yinz anyway,\" he said. \"C'mon. I 'aint got much time left! I'll be dead before I get seated!\"  Then a middle-aged couple we struck up a conversation with while in line asked if we wanted to eat with them. They were left with two extra seats at their table due to another couple no-showing.   Where else but in Pittsburgh do people want to dine with complete strangers? We'd never been there before yet were made to feel welcome regardless. It was as if we were lifelong customers.  \"When are ya buying a house out this way?\" we were asked.   Speaking of that line, once we paid our tab and departed, we noticed that it was snaking out into the parking lot and around the back of the building.   Dorido's isn't goin' belly up  anytime in the near future. Lordy, is this joint boomin'. Somethin' sure is shakin' in the 'burbs.",

My girlfriend had fish plater and it was slightly better but shrimp was way over cooked, her scallops where a nice size though.  The bathroom smelled as though it never was cleaned. Service was generally so so the waiter could have been much more friendly. It was only modestly busy but they were slow for service.  Wouldn't return.",

Now to the food, if you enjoy fish sandwiches, it's ok.  I personally think over the years, the quality has gone downhill considerably.  Everything on menu is fried so if you enjoy bar food, fried in the oldest grease possible, this is your place.     Now the grossest thing ever, I've watched a bartender spit into napkins, not wash hands, then serve food.  I've also watched at the bar, an employee take snuff out of his mouth and lift the top lid of a burger, and place the snuff on the burger of another employee.  Nice going, you jagoff!",

I had a reuben and my father had the crab stuffed cod.  Both were good but the seafood was obviously the real standout.  For years I'd heard nothing but good things about the fish sandwich and we will def be back to try.  The food is really good here.  Like, home cooking, dinner at Mom's kind of food (if your mom was a good cook).  The bar has a lot of taps and I bet this place would be very fun to go to during games.

Fish and chips was crispy. Crab cake was 99% crab meat (not like those cheap potato pancakes). The build-urself burger has everything from bacon to jalapeno, from mushrooms to onion rings. Fries not included with the burger though. So it's like $8-9 for burger and fries, vs. 9.99 crab cake sandwich with fries.",

Lots of locals, huge bar area.. TONS OF TV's! It's loud but not annoying. They have a pretty decent menu.. if you wanna eat it's seat yourself. My husband and I had the Famous Fish Fry.. the large is huge I got the smaller one as a sandwich but it was still huge. The fish fresh and well cooked.. nice flaky white fish.. but it lacked seasoning in the breading. The too large bun was not a good pick-it was just too much bread. You will see the photo.. no lettuce or tomato or I know blasphemy cheese on it.. it needed something for flavor. Sure they gave you what I figured was house made tarter and cocktail sauce a plus. You get two sides I got broccoli (it was cooked and soft) and cold French Fries? Really, seriously.. the fries were redone for me but all in all it was not all that memorable my Dad ordered the Chili that was tasty. Service is prompt and efficient but more like churn and burn and I get it.. it's a busy place. If they changed the bread, gave the fish some seasoning it would be stellar or just don't make it a sandwich. I think you can order it just as a fish dinner and maybe we should have done that but it was kind of flavorless. Refills on soft drinks were taken care of fast. When I come back to PA to visit family the only reason I would come in is to sit at the bar and have a beer or something. They have a lot to park..That's all I got.",

I've gotten takeout and dined in and despite a long wait to get a table, I recommend dining in if you can.   Can't go wrong with any of the seafood; Doridos does it well. Food is simple and fresh. Small fish sandwich is rather large and any of the broiled seafood is delicious.   It can get a little confusing walking in here on a busy night so here is the lowdown for first timers. There will be no signs, but there is a line to get a table and a separate line for take out. If you're getting takeout, walk straight in to the bar and someone in the bar will eventually take care of you. If you'd like a table, there will be a line that starts around the left corner of the bar. You won't be acknowledged until a table is ready. Once you get a table, service will be pretty efficient and it won't take too long for your food to come out.   Considering how packed it's been here every time I've come, it's everyone's go-to for casual seafood in the south hills, as it is mine.",

A working man bar, and a treat to visit without drawing down the family bank account!   No so anymore!!!  High Class Menu, with high class prices!  Fish Sandwiches that were very sparse, with small pieces of over cooked cod, not breaded huge sides of white fish as in the old days!  Men waiters, which added a bar atmosphere to the surroundings were no longer working there!  I not sure South Park needs a high class fish restaurant as we have the South Park sports bar, which we recently visited also!  It blew Doridos off the South Park map!  Better food, better service, better everything!  And wait to you see the size of their regular fish sandwiches, and their truly great French fries!!!   Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!!

    "text": "One of the best Cod sandwiches I have ever had... doing it Pittsburgh style at Dorido's! The food was amazing and so was the service. The shrimp app was on point, full of flavor and generous in portion. The cold was crispy and bread crispy the coleslaw was not running, not vinegary, nor taste like mayo.. fries nice and crispy! The walley was cooked to perfection and the old school mac & cheese with the big noodles brought me back in time! Definitely the place to stop... oh and the taps had a great selection.",

Thin deli slices and what seemed like canned overly salty gravy out of a heinz jar; quite disappointed.",

    "text": "Really not very good.  This place was probably good 20 years ago but it's now living off of customer loyalty and not quality.  I had the fish and chips.  There was zero seasoning on the fish, not even salt.  The breading was like a casing that my fish fell out of, leaving a greasy, chewy  pouch.  I couldn't eat more than a third of it.  The server (or whoever) who took our order was rude and acted like we were inconveniencing him by our presence.   Avoid this place.",

    "text": "Doridos is awesome for their fish. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish is a real generous size and the fries were wonderful. All hot and that's what I want when I order fish and fries. Their service is fast, you don't have to wait long for your food. My son ordered their grilled cheese and that was actually really good too. You never know what you're going to get when ordering a child's grilled cheese sandwich. The seating area is not huge but they can fit a good amount of people in there. There is the bar section then a few steps up tables and chairs.",

    "text": "My co-worker and I stopped in for lunch Thursday 12/1 and ate at the bar. The service was top notch and the food was delicious.   We started out with the fried clams appetizer which was pretty decent for not being a dedicated fish place.  My buddy ordered the fish sandwich and he enjoyed it. He couldn't finish his meal and got a takeaway box, but wound up forgetting it. He was kicking himself about it for the rest of the day.   I ordered one of the four specials for the day - the chicken parmesan sandwich, but asked for banana peppers. We were going to go to the Elrama Tavern for lunch, but he suggested Dorido's instead. I love the same sandwich from ET and had it on the brain, so I figured I'd satisfy that craving. It worked.   There were four or five soups on the specials board, which appeals to me greatly. However, I was afraid the Maryland crab soup wouldn't pair well with my chicken sandwich, so I balked on ordering it.  South Park is a little out of they way from my house in Canonsburg, but somewhat closer to Monongaltuckey where my buddy lives. I would make the trip to check this place out again, though.  I initially marked this place four out of five stars, but I couldn't think of a reason why it shouldn't get five. Great service, tasty food, and decent prices. Five stars.",

When it arrived, the chicken was so dry I could not chew it, forgot the lettuce, cheese was like gum, and the bun was dry. The whole sandwich was a ness and fell apart plus they served it on a very small plate and the food was falling off the edges.  The male waiter is extremely unfriendly and in a rush.  There is no excuse for any of this.  I've been here before and it is going downhill.",

    "text": "When I used to live in South Park I would often walk over here to get their fish sandwiches to take home with me. Doritos is a full service restaurant and bar. Place usually gets packed.  While they are known for seafood they have hamburgers, salads, and other offerings on their menu. Service is friendly and food is served promptly. On this particular visit I wanted to try their fish and chips. The fish they serve come in generous portions. If you order it fried you probably will end up taking some of it home with you.   Since fried foods normally don't agree with me I asked if I could have it baked. My waiter was also kind enough to offer me a substitute baked potato instead of the fries for the same reason. The fish comes with both tartar and cocktail sauces. Along with it I got the both baked potato and Cole slaw. The entire meal was just under $10.00. Food was very good and I enjoyed all of it.  They have booth seating in the front and if you head towards the back up a short flight of stairs there is table seating. In the middle is the bar area. You normally pay at the bar but on this occasion they brought the check to me. Often overlooked, Dorido's is located on Brownsville Road in South Park near the golf course and across from a small group of shops across the street.  They are now serving Lenten specials which include pierogies and haluska for under $5.00. They also have fresh seafood listed along with their daily specials.  Will definitely return when I am in the area.",
