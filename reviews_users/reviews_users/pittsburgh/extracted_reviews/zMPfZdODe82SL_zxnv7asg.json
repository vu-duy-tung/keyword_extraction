    "text": "Needed a fast bite to eat as I had to hit the hay early and catch a 6 am flight to Chicago.  This place was near my hotel and I always hear people rave about it so I thought I would give it a shot.  You walk in and there's a counter with a variety of fixins, you can get taco's, burritos, chips, guacamole, and a burrito bowl which is like a burrito but the tortilla is on the side.  Idea is you pick from a variety of ingredients such as rice, beans, sour cream, meat, chicken, etc., etc. and they roll it up in a big honking burrito for you.   I got a burrito with rice, black beans, steak and also some chips and guacamole.  Started with the chips and guacamole.  Chips weren't stale but they were not fresh either, not crunchy.  Guacamole was pretty average.  The burrito was fairly tasty, I liked the abundance of rice and beans with just enough meat to give it some character.  I didn't particularly like the atmosphere of the place, it was dark and sported a certain euro-minimalism that highlighted the fact that the place was dirty.  Tables were greasy, floors were dirty, and drink fountain had spilled crap all over.  Chipotle isn't a bad idea but there was something about the place that turned me off.  My guess is that it's a typical chain where the people there are just doing their jobs, there's no sense of ownership.  If I want to enjoy a big honking burrito, I think I would rather go to a Super Mercado where they know how to make a real burrito, not just assemble one.  And where they are happy to have you as a customer.",

Conveniently located to the airport, it's a great place to stop on the way or on the way home, but if you go at peak hours, the parking lot is a nightmare, and so is traffic. The staff is generally attentive and efficient, so the lines always move quickly. This is probably the biggest \"plus\" of this location.  The bathrooms definitely leave a lot to be desired. They are never clean, and often smell. It's not that difficult to keep a bathroom clean, so this needs to be improved.  Despite the bathroom situation, the staff is always pleasant and the food is always dependable and fresh.",

Maybe they havent been to another location to see that the fast service sells just as much as the food does. Lastly, we tried to order one item off the app today  and the wait time for pick up was 1hour and 1/2 . !! Whoa. It was 238pm. ...really!

Chipotle packs a lot of calories in one meal so that made it the perfect 7 hour traveling time pre-flight meal! At noon it was packed with business men on their lunch break and hungry Pittsburgh folks.  This isn't what I would call authentic Mexican food but this is still REALLY GOOD.  You can get burritos, burrito bowls, hard or soft tacos, and a quesadilla (for vegetarians).  The BURRITO BOWL is my favorite thing to get because it's basically everything inside a burrito, without the tortilla! Cilantro lime rice, spicy marinated steak, black beans, cheese, lettuce, mild tomato salsa, sour cream, and guacamole (extra cost) is my suggestion! Sometimes you're just in the mood for a good fatty burrito.  Got Guac all over my face every time I tired to take a bite, but that's just how large the burrito was :)",

I understand the location is really busy, however, they have too many staff behind the counter.  8 people behind the counter and a cashier that creates confusion.   No one cleaning the dining area.  This area was pretty disgusting;  trash on the floor, tables, chairs, and garbage cans overflowing.   This one particular day, I was there earlier, and observed a kid throwing food on the glass.  I had to leave before ordering, but returned about 4 hours later, and the food and trash was still on the glass and floor.   The sidewalk was pretty nasty with food and spills.  That's an easy fix.  The bucket of water from mopping could just be dumped out just to rinse off the walkway.   I travel all over the county, and have frequented Chipotle 3-4 times a week.  They are all busy, but they maintain a balance with the hygiene of the dinning area.   This location didn't meet the minimal of my experience of this chain.",

I turn around in line and see a swarm of people starting to gather. I truly think someone's watching out for me or maybe I just eat during nontraditional hours.  I'll be honest, I won't branch out and try something new. I always get a bag of chips with a steak burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side OR a steak burrito . I also get extra rice, a little bit of corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. (Was it just me or did you envision going down the line?)

I was in town for the Steelers game (grandson's favorite team) and well you know how the kids love their Chipotle so Margie said why the heck not. I love a good Chipotle bowl every now and again. So, grandson, son in law  and I walk into this Chipotle. The smells are all there, the guac, the chicken, the bathroom, the heart disease. Looks like your standard Chipotle,.. It was a Sunday before the Big game so it was quite packed. The employees are sweating into the tortillas as they roll up burritos as fast as they cann. Everything seems perfectly normak right? NOPE. So Margie goes up to order.. i get my chicken burrito bowl, and this man gives me one tiny tiny scoop of white rice. What am i a rat in a skinner box?? Unbelievable. I am a Carbs gal so I typically ask for extra rice anyway but i'm REALLY gonna need extra rice for that. I (POLITLEY) ask for some more, and somehow he makes rhat scoop even tinier? Not sure if this was his way of telling Margie to watch her old figure or what, (like I said i love to eat Carbs) but seriously he was frugal with his rice. Everyone else is lovely, (except girl gives me WAY too much of the mild sayce, but you win some and you lose some. When you're this old you learn to pick your battles) until I finally get to the gal ringing me out. Incredibly rude and short with me. I had to tell her five times I wanted chips wirh my order.. you would think she is the 60 year old! Very attitude when I correct her too. So we finally completes transaction and she pushes my stuff out of the way and goes on to my grandson. NO TRAY OR ANYTHING! Very rude. We all gave bad days so I try to brush it off. Finally we are sitting down, about to munch on our meals, and my food tastes.... funny. Not sure. Never had a chipotle burrito bowl taste that way. It was Sad. I ask my grandson ajd he says \"yeah mine tastes a little funny too\". Also the rude lady tried to flirt with my Grandson rught after my rude encounter. Incredibly tasteless, honey, he has a girlfriend and his granny is right there! Thankfully I am not from the Pittsburgh area, as my local Chipotle in Wilkes Barre far surpasses this. At least Steelers won yesterday. Barely scraping by just like this Chipotle. Thank for Your time and God Bless everyone. Have a Merry Christmas.",

Sadly, the downside is the inconsistent food quality. Last visit, the mild salsa tasted as if it had three times the salt called for in the recipe. In past visits, there have been times when the meats are way over seasoned. It's as if the employees are throwing things together without paying much attention, which is also the impression I have of Chipotle's way of assembling my orders and customer \"service.\" Other reviews on this location being a mess are spot on. I only take out as a result.",

    "text": "I come here often...way too often...since I work out in Robinson and it's the only Chipotle in the area. (Major excuse - I am here way too often because I'm addicted). No matter when I try to come in whether it's 11, 12, 1 or 2..it's ALWAYS packed. The lines are always  wrapped around and almost out the door. The usual wait for me is a good 15-20 minutes in line during peak lunch hours - it is annoying, but you know what I ain't mad about it I still enjoy my meal at the end of the day.   This particular location is a real hit or miss in all senses. I've come in and despite the line, have had fantastic service. The assemblers up front are nice and really accommodating when you ask for a little extra love in your bowl or burrito. Generally all most Chipotle's give you a pretty good portion regardless. I'm in and out in the line and it's a breeze to grab my stuff and go or dine in.   Other times I've been in it's been a real struggle bus where my mild is way too watery and it just sops up at the bottom of my bowl...or even worse! LEAKS! Sometimes they have ' too many cooks in the kitchen' in the assembly line and causes a back up instead of speed. I've read reviews where trash isn't taken out or they run out of stuff at the drink/utensil bar - True.   Fact of the matter is, all franchises are not created equal and management is different everywhere. They have their good and bad days so this one still gets a three. I've had more good experiences here than I have had bad. And you know what...it's not going to stop me from coming back.",

There was only a handful in the bag! Ironically, on the website it says the chips serve 2 people. I would go back to this location, just inspect my food before I leave if I take it home.",

The staff obviously doesn't care and they'll remake your food but only with half the portion size of the regular meal. It's a disappointing experience. Go somewhere else for $30 fast food or drive to a different location, you'll be better off.  As a suggestion: Panera, Five Guys, Firehouse, and Burgatory all flank this chipotle. You have options that will probably be a more valuable use of time and money.",

    "text": "I am an out of towner from the DMV area and I have been to many chipotle fast food chains there as well as other places. I have experience some of the best chains and some of the worse chains. This one is surprisingly good! I arrived here around 11:15am 2/3/18. The place wasn't crowded and it was very clean. The guy who started my order was extremely pleasant and gave me a very decent amount of food :-) Some places can be very stingy with toppings. Overall my experience was positive and the next time I'm in Pittsburg most specifically the area this chain is in I will be back.",

    "text": "I love Chipotle, and I used to love this location. Used to have friendly staff and gave perfect to generous portions! I always loved going to this location. But now the staff is rude, barely make eye contact, speaks so quickly I cannot understand what they are saying (and it's not like I'm elderly and hard of hearing), and the portions they are doling out are a joke. A couple weeks ago, when the young man behind the counter started running out of rice, instead of asking if I wanted to wait for more, he just scraped the dried out minuscule amount of rice off the sides of the pan and passed it along. Today I hoped to get a better crew, nope, barely even looked up once, had to ask then to repeat what they said, and the smallest amount of every ingredient...usually I have trouble finishing a burrito bowl, today I finished still hungry. The woman behind me had the sense the ask for more rice, meat and cheese...I should have taken her lead. They need to retrain employees to engage their customers and not skimp out on portions.",

The only complaint I have is... they are terrible about replenishing the ice and soda in their soda machine. Oh and coupons, where are they? I want some.",

Might as well go to the one further away from my house. Plus i went in and im all about fast service but literally throwing the food into the burrito as fast as you can doesn't count. Half of everything goes on the table and leaves you with half the portion. Also the worker had to pick what looked like green peppers out of my steak because it got mixed in the serving bucket ??",
