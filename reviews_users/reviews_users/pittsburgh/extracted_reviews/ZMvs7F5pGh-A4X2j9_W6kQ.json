Their clam chowder is gold standard, their sandwiches are yums, and the atmosphere is classic. The servers/kitchen staff is always pleasant and helpful. On sundays they have the legendary donut robot cranking out delicious fried treats for all the boys and girls... donuts don't get fresher than this.",

    "text": "I met friends for happy hour. The service was good. My cocktail was fine.  The mini lobster roll was the worst I've ever had. It didn't even resemble lobster rolls I've had before. I've eaten them in a small town in Maine, in Boston, and Philadelphia. The bread is a thin delivery system for a filling with large chunks of lobster lightly coated in a tasty sauce. By volume, it's at least 80% lobster and white in color, because lobster meat is mostly white.  I expected it to be small, but the bread was actually the largest I've ever seen. The filling was a thin -- perhaps 1/4 inch? -- smear. It was pink. Any  lobster present was barely visible as tiny flakes. The dominant element was dry, flavorless bread.  I was hungry after work, and didn't want to make any fuss and spoil my friends' fun, so I ate it, but I was appalled.  It was served with thin white things that I didn't recognize at first, but figured out that they were onion rings. I expect onion rings to be crisp and golden brown. I tried one. It was limp, flavorless, and greasy. I wasn't hungry enough to eat them them.  I've never eaten at the Grand Concourse, and after seeing what they serve as bar food, I'm not inclined to take a risk on an expensive meal.",

    "text": "This is a very difficult review for me. I've been an enthusiastic, boastful, bragging regular customer of The Gandy Dancer for many, many years.. Great food, great drinks and the ambience; can't find better. I was very excited to take my partner for drinks and dinner tonite before the Riverhounds Soccer game. Wow! What a disappointment!  Sparse crowd, but less restaurants (Joe's Crab Shack, Hard Rock, etc) had a 35-40 minute wait? Our waitress wasn't the best, very loopy, spacey, wasn't sure about the menu. She forgot parts of our order; the order was wrong, and we asked for water several times. She probably could be better (efficient??) with more training? But she's not working at McDonalds? My partner ordered the fried fish dinner; very tasty. I ordered salad, with no onions, and honey mustard dressing and the scallop appetizer. I recd salad with sliced onions and house dressing? I Didn't return, because I didn't want to wait. But the \"Dynamite scallop\" appetizer was the biggest disappointment! 5 1/2 shell; scallops crab encrusted; basil drizzle.  But I recd 5 1/2 shells with 2 dime size scallops( maybe smaller) on 3 shells and 1 tiny scallop on 2 shells. I had to re look at the menu questioning \"crab encrusted\" that didn't exist?  Placed on black paper with shredded \"something\" in the middle? So sad; this was my go to place for friends, family, and anyone asking where to eat? Management needs to be more on top of what is going on. No complaints about the bartenders-great!  Tourists with children want a place to eat; not a kid friendly menu? Will I return, absolutely, it's a Pittsburgh tradition, but will question the quality of the food. Now, too many other restaurant choices.",

    "text": "This has to be our favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  We love the old world atmosphere and the decor.  We enjoy sitting at the bar having a drink made by the well trained bartenders and just taking in the ambiance.  There's just something about it and  it just feels right to us.  This is the place that we choose to go when we feel like celebrating something or if we are meeting up with friends or if we just need to have a relaxing time on a Saturday afternoon.  We even spent this past New Year's Eve with them....what a wonderful time that was!!  We are planning to do it again!  It is always perfectly relaxing and enjoyable.  There's never a bad time to go to the Gandy Dancer!   Many years ago, the bartender introduced me to what is now my all time favorite cocktail--a Hendricks Gin Martini with a cucumber.  This is the place to get one for sure!  The prices might be a bit steep but if you hit it for happy hour--you can save some $$...they have a great Happy Hour.  As for food----you can't go wrong with the Charley's Chowder!  That's all I ever order when I go because I have loved it since the day they opened...way back when!!!   But, I've often picked off my husband's plate and I can vouch for almost all of their seafood entrees!   As time goes on, I find that we choose places for the experience more than the food.  You can get  good food at hundreds of places but not every place has the experience of the Gandy Dancer.  Why did I take me so long to write a review???  Now that I have, I have to plan another trip.  This weekend?  Yes!!!",

The decor and professional and friendly bartenders take you back to a time when people had pride in what they did.  They have a great happy hour for both food and drinks. Not only does the bar have their own menu you can also order from the Grand Course menu as well. They bring in fresh oysters from different locations and one of the days they have a $1 oyster special. However this last trip I went for the sliders with blue cheese.  They were decent and the caramelized onions and blue cheese really made the burgers. Can't wait to go back.",

Others joined us for coffee but our entrees still hadn't arrived. Finally they came. My 'pan seared scallops' were in a pond of pinkish thin sauce and were nowhere near being seared. Poached and tasteless. Coffee was served lukewarm. Rather than offer a fresh hot brew, our waitress offered to take it and warm it up. Amateur hour in the kitchen and on the floor. My host, their regular customer, was embarrassed. Chuck Meur restaurants used to be terrific. This one has sadly declined.",

I'm not sure if the restaurant side is more expensive (that's what I thought I over heard.)

    "text": "I really don't enjoy leaving bad reviews, so when I do, it is only after a True disappointment. We came in and decided on the casual saloon instead of the attached Grand Concourse. A woman came breezing by, noticed we were there, and grabbed the menus. Several minutes later, we ordered our drinks and appetizers.  After maybe 10 minutes, another young lady walked up. She mentioned that she had our drinks in and they should be up shortly. We realized that this woman was now our waitress, although it was never communicated to us... It was about her third time over that she actually introduced herself.  We got our drinks, and after another 15 minutes or so, we mentioned our appetizers. I got the impression that the order wasn't communicated very well from waitress to waitress. We got a bread basket for the table in the meantime, because we went hungry and had now been waiting about a half hour for any sign of food. When the bread came, we ordered our meals immediately before the waitress disappeared again. After the appetizers (shrimp dumplings for me, which tasted like they were from a P.F. Chang grocery freezer section box, and a mini surf and turf for her), I got up to look around. We thought that maybe this poor girl had to wait both the saloon and the dining hall, perhaps they were understaffed? It was a Monday night though, and not especially busy.  As I passed back through, I noticed two meals that looked an awful lot like what we ordered sitting and waiting to be picked up. I tried to tell myself that maybe some other table had just ordered the same exact thing (how funny, right?) We still hadn't received our side salads. I mentioned this to our waitress, when she finally magically reappeared, and she looked confused -\"Umm, sure, let me go check on that for you...\" Now you see her, Now you don't. 10-15 minutes elapsed, and I went to the restroom to check my lipstick... There were our meals, still just sitting there.  The second she brought the salads, my bold and livid friend said \"Are those our meals sitting out there?\"  She looked a little bit flustered. \"I'm not sure. I haven't checked yet.\"  You know, the saddest part is, besides the shrimp dumplings, all of our food was very good. Just a bit, you know, cold. I got the Salmon of the Angels (salmon medallions over angel hair pasta with a creamy basil tomato sauce) and really enjoyed it. And the drink I got, the Apple Pie Mule, is something I would actually go back for. Maybe if I went again, it would be for drinks at the bar.",

It was no surprise to me when my mom said this is where she wanted to celebrate her birthday this past weekend. This place is an oldie but goodie!   We went around 2:00 in the afternoon and sat at the bar.. being that it was such an odd time there were only about 2 other parties inside other than my parents & I. I started with my favorite cocktail.. a cosmopolitan. I will say that this is the best Cosmo I have had recently (if not ever)! It is served in a chilled martini glass and the drink is poured to perfection. My parents both got martinis as well, my mom loves their Hendricks's gin martini & my dad gets dirty martinis. They both loved every sip as well!   I started with their soup of the day which was wedding soup. It was great for a cold afternoon! My only complaint was that it was just a little too salty, but it was still good! The bartender gave us a menu for the Grand Concourse and told us we were welcome to order anything off that menu for lunch in addition to what is on the Gandy Dancer's menu. I ended up ordering the Island Fish tacos from GC's menu. These were fabulous! I loved the mango salsa on these- it gave them the perfect amount of sweetness mixed with hot flavors from the dynamite sauce. My mom got her favorite soup the Charley's Chowder & my dad got the diner burger & they enjoyed their meals as well. If you are looking for a classic bar with great service, great food, and even greater cocktails than check out the Gandy Dancer!",

My husband and I stopped by on Friday the 13th prior to our Grand Concourse dinner reservations next door, and what a great decision that was!  As can be expected, the $5 glasses of wine during Happy Hour were more than twice the price in the restaurant.  We gobbled up an order of the craft beer battered cod (light and flakey and served with thick rich tartar sauce; couldn't have been better), the raw oysters (all 3 were nice and mild, just the way I like them), and the white flatbread (a nice cracker-thin crust).  That, a few glasses of wine, and we were off to our dinner reservations next door.  I have to say, all things considered and bang for buck, Gandy Dancer stands right up to Grand Concourse.  Service was great, efficient.  We snagged the last open table in the jovial bar area, and our server was on top of everything.  The food and refills came out quickly despite Happy Hour being in full swing.",

    "text": "Today it was my husband's turn to pick where we ate. He chose The Gandy Dancer. We had not been there in over 20 years. It is in an older historical building at Station Square. When you go in it's like walking back in time. It has all of the original dark woodwork. There are pictures of Pittsburgh dated in the early 1900s. The lighting is low and on a hot day like today it was a great setting for lunch.  Our server was Colin. He gave us the BEST customer service we've had in a long time.  My husband ordered the jambalaya. It came with a salad. I shared the salad with him and it was really good. It had romaine lettuce, purple onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers. It was dressed with a balsamic dressing. It was very fresh and very tasty. I didn't try my husband's jambalaya but he cleaned his plate. It had huge shrimp, scallops, mussels, and salmon. It looked wonderful but I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness so I chose not to try it.  I had the Blue Crab Club sandwich. It had crab, tomatoes, bacon,  lettuce, and Boursin. I asked that they leave the tomatoes off. It came with fries and coleslaw. The sandwich was very good. The crunch of the lettuce and the toast went well with the creaminess of the crab. The coleslaw was a little different than most. It had cabbage and carrots but it also had green peppers. I'm not sure what they used for dressing but it wasn't mayo or vinegar. The French fries were cooked perfectly.  I asked to see their dessert menu. Colin said all of the desserts were made on site. The Key Lime pie was tempting but I went for the Mango Sorbet. It was smooth and a perfect summer dessert. It came with a couple of raspberries and a pirouette cookie. My husband was only going to have a taste but couldn't stop at one spoonful.  We definitely won't wait another 20 years to go back.",

The food was fine, but nothing special.  I will not be running back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Ok.  Now let's not fool ourselves. This is the bar to the Grand Concourse. Same kitchen. Same management. Same awesomeness. Now as for the menu differences.   When dining in the bar one can order from the Grand Concourse menu and Gandy Dancer menu, which in my opinion makes this the best place to eat. That combined with the ridiculously inexpensive happy hour prices just makes it an excellent spot to grab a bite.  (Now keep in mind, when dining in the Grand Concourse, you can't order from the Gandy Dancer menu)   What to order... So many options, where to begin-   I'll start w Happy Hour bites. Yes, say yes to them. They're priced at a few dollars each and great for ordering a bunch with a group. I'm partial to the steamed dumplings. Yummy & inexpensive.   The bar menu.  What I love about the bar menu is that it's fantastic to show up and order a hearty meal to warm you up in the cold months or a crisp light flavorful meal to refresh one in the summer.   To begin. The pasta is awesome. Made in house. My personal favorite is the artichoke, shrimp, and angel hair in a light tomato base. It seems to be close to or the same item that disappeared from the Grand Concourse menu. The pasta menu is great. So many options. Light sauces, hearty sauces, spicy, tortellini, so many choices.   My second favorite pasta dishes are a tie between the Cajon Chicken Tortellini and the Shrimp Fettuccine Verde. The Cajon Chicken Tortellini is served in a cream sauce with mushrooms. (And I say I hate mushrooms) It is really a fantastic mix of the right amount of Cajon mixed with the cream mushroom sauce and chicken & tortellini. A fantastic dance of spice and everything perfectly hits your taste buds Fettuccine is a very traditional dish that I typically am not a huge fan of. The Shrimp Fettuccini Verde is a Spinach fettuccine with goat cheese in a cream tomato sauce. It's different in a really good way that you must like goat cheese to enjoy.    I also love the Shrimp & Crab Salad. The crab is Lump Crab. I have it with tomatoes & cucumbers. It's a Greek style vinaigrette. Delicious. Great in the summer.   The Gandy House Salad is also very crisp & delicious. I order is customized without onion or pepperancini. It comes w fresh & sundries tomatoes along with cucumber in a vinaigrette. Another great start to a meal.   The bread served with dinner is delicious. Same as the Grand Concourse's. I hate salmon pate. It's a personal choice but my kid loves it. The bar tabled area is very kid friendly. We've taken Mr. Toddler since he was an nugget and they've always accommodated his needs. His favorite item at both locations is their pate. (It's also served during the Sunday Brunch.)   My family loves the oysters. Again, another thing I don't care for. They adore the Grand Concourse & Gandy Dancers Selection. They're the same.  I personally don't consume anything from their raw bar other than shrimp so I cant comment specifically on items. The family seems to love it. That's what I know.   The one item that my husband ordered and didn't love was the sirloin steak. He said he wouldn't get it again.  He said it was good but just not what he typically would order.",

We looked at each other thinking we were in the wrong place, because it used to be so nice here.   We ordered martinis and they were just ok.  Vodka wasn't cold enough and didn't fill the glass.   The bartender never ever said a word to us.  It was bizarre.  Prices weren't bad, which was surprising.     The place was dead on a Saturday night at 7:00.",

We sat at the bar and since it was Thanksgiving the crowd was packed in the lobby waiting for the Thanksgiving buffet. We inquired about the price of the buffet which was $42!! The bar was quiet and we were waited on quickly and kindly by the bartender. I ordered a Pomegranate Martini and my companion ordered some type of bourbon. The Martini was excellent and so was the bourbon! I love the atmosphere here and would love to come back on a non holiday to try the food again. I definitely recommend the Gandy Dancer!",

We went on a Thursday and they had a great special on oysters $1 a piece so of course we got a dozen.  They have a special happy hour menu which had a nice selection of items to nosh on- I would totally recommend the flatbread and the blue cheese sliders (they served 2 and were way bigger than what I thought they'd be AND they came with French fries!).  I would not get the mini lobster roll - too much bread and not enough lobster or filling.  The oysters were perfect!  This was not on the HH menu (it's on the regular dinner menu) but the fish tacos were really fresh and delicious and a great deal! Came with a bowl of black bean soup and a side of rice too all for $12.  The wines were $6 a glass and the cab was actually tasty!  Would definitely come again for the happy hour!  Josh, our server, was attentive and great.",

    "text": "This is another occasion where I wish Yelp gave the option to hand out 3.5 stars because this really was a 3.5 star experience. First, Gandy Dancer and Grand Concourse are basically in the same building and are somewhat connected. Even though I thought I was looking at the Gandy menu on Yelp, I was somehow actually looking at the Grand menu, and that's the menu where I found what I wanted. So, seeing that the negative ratings were primarily for the service rather than the food, I ventured into Gandy to grab the Blue Crab Club Sandwich. Again, I had thought it was on their menu. I sat at the bar, got a menu, and quickly realized it was different from online. No problem, the bartender (who had greeted me quickly) said I could order from either menu. Great! I ordered the club with fries, holding the tomato, and it came out soon thereafter. Maybe it's the lack of tomatoes that's the cause, but I had a lot of bread (three slices since it's a club), a lot of lettuce, a layer of bacon, and not much crab. Every bite's taste was pretty much bread, lettuce, mayo (a lot of mayo!), a hint of bacon, and an even more slight hint of crab. The crab tasted good from what I could gather. There just wasn't enough of it. I love mayo, don't get me wrong, but this had a lot of mayo. I was wiping my mouth (and face) with my napkin after every bite. Mayo lovers of Pittsburgh, rejoice! This is your mayo haven! The fries were fantastic. Crispy, but not overly crunchy, with good flavor. Service was consistent, but not fantastic. My tea glass sat mostly empty for a long time and was never refilled. At the point I put my credit card out, it sat there for awhile before the bartender noticed. Overall, good but not great, and worthy of a 3.5 star rating.",

The issue we had was with their draft beer system.  The Coors Light smelled a bit sour & tasted a little bitter.  I think the lines needed cleaned.

    "text": "I gave three stars because I believe it's probably better than was demonstrated tonight.  Service was kind of strange. I sat at the bar and the communication with the staff would have put me to sleep had it not been so early.  Boring is an understatement.  Recommendations were met with, it's ok or it depends....you have to say what it depends on!!!!   It was like pulling teeth.   The food was equally boring.   I had the seafood steamer pot.  It really lacked any flavor, but what upsets me is that 5 muscles never opened.  SO WHY PUT THEM ON MY PLATE???  The Charley's chowder was good, so no complaints with that.   I wanted to change wines and had to ask for the menu several times.    Let's hope next time I'm in town I realize this was not a typical night.",

    "text": "I had higher hopes for the Gandy Dancer based on recommendations by friends and unfortunately my experience this past Saturday night with 6 of my girlfriends fell extremely short.  We arrived around 8:30 and most tables were full, but it wasn't bustling and busy which was fine for us.  We sat ourselves and a waitress came over about 10 minutes later to take our drink orders.  She seemed new from the beginning, and I am not sure if she was just overwhelmed, but I have to say our service throughout the night was really poor.  It took quite a while for our 3 dirty martinis, 2 cosmos and 2 mango mojitos to arrive and we had to ask twice for ice waters.  The cosmos and mojitos were excellent. The dirty martinis, in addition to the glass only arriving half full, were hard to drink.  Just not very well made.  We placed our food orders and we were so into conversation amongst ourselves that I didn't realize how long it took, but we did have to keep asking for water & drink refills in the meantime.  I ordered the Charley's Chowder and their bruschetta and around the table, others got the crab stuffed mushrooms, Caesar salad, burger and fries, and salmon pasta.  Our food was good. Not anything great or amazing. Nothing that I would hurry back to get again.  It was standard and in my opinion, there are better places to get bar food in the Burgh.  The fries seemed to be frozen and the flatbread the bruschetta came with was just plain.  The soup was good, but I added salt.  The pasta was good from the bites I tried but again, just kind of average.  We ended up having a drink at the bar after dinner and by that time, the place was completely cleared out of anyone left.  Our bartender was extremely friendly and funny. They were cleaning up the restaurant while we waited for our Uber to the next location and she was fun to chat with before we took off.  It was just OK. I'd go back and give it another try, hopefully with better service. Not in any hurry, though.",

    "text": "We went with friends for an early dinner. Our waiter just did his job, take our order, refill our waters, delivered our order and brought the check. Food was fresh and tasty, although the shrimp/crabmeat salad was lacking crabmeat and the shrimp had the peel left on!!  The manger offered to bring a new salad but it was already half eaten. Did comp the dish. Never asked at the end of our meal if we were interested in coffee or dessert. Disappointed for a place like that. Will think twice before going back.",
