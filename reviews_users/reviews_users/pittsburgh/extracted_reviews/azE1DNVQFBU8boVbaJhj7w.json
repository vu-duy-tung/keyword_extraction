    "text": "Best dining experience in Pittsburgh during our short stay.   Bread - nice assortment of cold focaccia and cheese grissini (skinny bread sticks) served with two white bean spreads (kalamata and pesto). YUM.   Insalata Mista ($8). They split the salad without even asking (cool!) and the Frisee was topped with vinegary red onion strings, artichokes, and a roasted Roma tomato. Double yum with more bread. They also do a Caesar, a beet and goat cheese salad and an arugula, pear, and Gorgonzola salad (all about the same price).   Pasta - WILD boar ravioli (yes you have to say it with emphasis). Slightly sweet pulled pork in what was obviously homemade pasta sheets ($16). Interesting and good quality.   Second Piatti - Oven baked calamari ($17) dusted with breadcrumbs served over fava beans in a thyme, red pepper and escarole sauce. In a bite, both mild and spicy. Delicious!!!   No room for dessert. Friends ate the trio of pasta (no rave reviews here, much like other yelpers, which may be due to the fact that they obviously make larger batches and dish them out of the pan at your table... not ideal for al dente pasta, but a good value if you want to try more dishes). Cannelloni got a thumbs up, but two members of the group raved about the asparagus and crab risotto (which may have been seasonal).   We did not have to wait for a table. Service was prompt and friendly. Great ambiance. Delicious food at a very reasonable price considering the pastas were homemade. Lots of seasonal specials. Can't go wrong here (unless you do the trio of pastas, apparently). Thanks Yelpers for the tip before we went!",

    "text": "I had the pasta trio which is basically three different types of pasta with unlimited servings, with a salad to start and a desert to finish. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The salad was a good Cesar salad that you can replace with an arugula salad if you choose. It started the meal off nice. But the real treat was the pasta...all three kinds were fantastic, served family style, but the best one was the ravioli with pear and ricotta. It was to die for...everyone at the table was getting multiple servings of those and they weren't heavy, just were absolutely delicious!  Oh, before I continue, we got a variety of wine. I had a white Pinot Grigio that was right on point...the servers will help you, but at this classic Italian restaurant, the wine fit the billing.  Finally, I got a sorbet variety for desert and was surprised with how tasty the balsamic gelato was. The initial thought was that it'd taste like balsamic vinegar, but it has the sweet taste of balsamic without the bitterness of the vinegar like we're used to. It was my favorite of the three ice cream's I was given.  The atmosphere was serene and Lidia, who has a show on the Food Network, clearly takes a lot of pride in the integrity and service as both were impeccable.  Prices are on the higher side but certainly manageable.   I hope to be in Pittsburgh again so I can go to Lidia's. I went with a group of 10 or so and we sat around a big table and never felt out of place or as if we were disrupting people. It's 100 percent Italian and I love it!",

    "text": "Lidia's is an upscale Olive Garden with slightly better wine list.  The biggest problem?  Everything is bland. They have a salt problem. They must not have it in their kitchen. Everything needed it.  The salads were the only fairly good items we had. The arugula salad with pear walnuts and Gorgonzola was well dressed, but the beets were not cooked to their sweet level.   The lamb chops were awful. Lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb.  I sent it back. They replaced it with pork tenderloin served on a tomato sauce (needed salt) and with cheese melted over the top with asparagus and a slice of Roma tomato. It was a sad sad dish. The tomato was hard as rock. The tenderloin was over cooked.  Just bad.  I had the chicken piccata upon the recommendation of the server. It had lemon, capers and green olives. The vinegar fought with the lemon in the most vile way. The chicken had that flour coated slime feel in the mouth. Served on a bed of spinach. That was the only decent taste on the plate if it didn't have any of the sauce on it.   Bread is awful. They have a foccacia and skinny bread sticks that tasted stale to me. Served with an olive spread and a garlic white bean spread. They were fine on their own - in fact rather tasty.  The menu is really odd. Just in the way it is laid out and with the choices. Two west coast fish selections. Halibut and salmon.  Coming from the west coast, I just overlooked them by a matter of principle.   But the worse is the pasta trio. The concept is just so olive garden. All you can eat of three different pastas served table side. They cart a saute pan to your table. What is that all about? Our neighbors ordered it and I over heard them talking to their server about their disappointment.  But like all things Pittsburgh the people were so nice. They were gracious about the lamb and took it and the pork replacement off the bill.   I just have to wonder why Lidia would create a menu like this. It just doesn't match her books or shows at all. It does nothing to support the brand of Lidia. Unless she is really trying to take over the Olive Garden market.",

The issues with service were:  - It took 10 minutes to get menus and to get a wine order in.   - Requested refill of bread spreads never happened, even with a second reminder.   - When my sister inquired about the fish of the day, the waiter firmly and quickly said 'there is none.' It is hard to convey the rudeness in a review, but our table certainly exchanged looks about this behavior.   - Fruit flies were in evidence, and ended up in our wine bottle. They replaced the bottle, and we kept it corked.   A great meal taken down several notches by inferior service.",

I thought it was pretty good and a heaping mound of food that took me a bit longer than I thought to finish. I probably wouldn't try the pasta trio since it didn't look that special and you can't eat that much pasta to make the unlimited servings worthwhile. Service is pretty good.",

    "text": "I had dinner at Lidia's on Saturday evening, February 22, 2014. I flew in from TX to celebrate my parent's 50th wedding anniversary. Lidia's was the chosen restaurant and I was very excited. We were a party of 8 and were crowded around a round table. Five of us ordered the Pasta Trio and it was the BEST fettuccine and ravioli! The pasta was fresh and the taste was out of this world! The disappointment came when we wanted more. We sat at length waiting for seconds after our initial taste trio. When we were served again, I received a spoonful of fettuccine - one to three bites. Our drinks, other than water, were only refilled once. I ended up switching from iced tea to water, not by choice but before I noticed, my tea glass was filled with water. I was also bumped throughout the meal by wait staff walking between me and a temporary wall that was put up to accommodate a large birthday party. Fortunately I can get good pasta with much better service elsewhere. I really wish I could say otherwise but I will not be back and wouldn't recommend this location unless maybe for lunch or a less busy evening. I am pretty sure if Lidia experienced the service in her own restaurant she would be appalled!",

    "text": "During a recent roadtrip to Pittsburgh our party of three found ourselves tired and ready for something delicious for dinner with the caveat that it had to be walking distance from our hotel. We consulted Yelp and decided to try out Lidia's for dinner.   The place is located on the fringes of the Strip and has nice clean feel to it. That's about as good as things got for me personally. The service was not very good. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes although the dining room was almost empty. A bread basket was placed on the table, but the bread was not very good. Once our waiter did come, (he looked like a Mafia Don) it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  I ordered the grilled octopus on a bed of potatoes and an heirloom tomato salad, both appetizers, as my meal. The tomatoes were not ripe and unfortunately did not have enough acid of any kind on them so that flavor was quite bland. There was no salt or pepper on the table, and no pepper was offered either. The octopus was bland but quite tender and fresh.  My husband ordered the salmon which he thought was good but a bit overcooked overall -- nothing to write home about.   The third person in our party ordered the pork porter house which was very tasty.  Based on fellow Yelpers we ordered the strawberry pannacotta for desert but unfortunately they had none at 7:30! We settled for cookies and a tiramisu. We left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Actually, wanted to go to Piccolo Forno, but they said they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more and for two of us there might be a half our wait. We wanted a sure, immediate thing so we decided to try Lidia's.  DRINKS: My husband had the cabernet and said it was fine, nothing spectacular but def what you'd expect from a cabernet. I had their Prosecco. It was good, not as sweet as I'd like, but still tasty.  APPETIZERS: We didn't order any dishes intended to be appetizers (you'll read what I mean), but we did enjoy the basket of bread and unique spreads (garbanzo and something, olive and something) that came with tit. The bread was not straight out of the oven, but it was definitely fresh-baked that day.  ENTREES: I ordered 2 appetizers instead of an entree. The first was the octopus dish, and it was THE BEST OCTOPUS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tasted like what it was but without being too briney/fishy. Also had a great texture. And the other items in the dish (capers, etc) complimented it really well. I don't use the word delicious that often, and I use delish even less often. But that was deliciously delish.  My 2nd appetizer-turned-entree was the cheese crisp. It was tasty, but super heavy. I chose the crab and scallion filling for that one, which was nice, but I think the whole cheese crisp idea (essentially cheese melted down to a \"cracker\") did not suit me. After a few bites I decided to pack the rest, but haven't eaten much of the leftovers. My husband tried the pasta trio (unlimited) and liked it, though he didn't rave about it. I think there was a spinach ravioi, some type of alfredo linguine, and a pesto with meat and a red sauce, so there was a good texture/flavor variety from what I could see on his plate. He ate two full plates of the variety of pastas and was stuffed!  DESSERT: We shared the Tiramisu. It was very fresh and authentic tasting. I felt like there was a bit too much espresso/coffee powder sprinkled on top, but perhaps my palate is sensitive to that. Overall it was yummy.  SERVICE: Friendly and attentive.    DEALS/DISCOUNTS: None  OVERALL: Glad we tried it. I would like to try the other well-rated Italian restaurants in Greater Pittsburgh, but I have a feeling I'll go back to Lidia's someday for that octopus -- so freakin' good!",

    "text": "When the bookends of your meal are the only strong points then you aren't going to score strongly in my book.  The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.    As for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.    I ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish.  Let the fish do the talking.  There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish.  The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar.  The desserts were very good however.  We went with the Tiramisu and  Semifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello (Milk Chocolate and carmel ice creams, chocolate cake, toasted meringue, crushed toffee).    The decor was definitely cool inside too.  Maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna?  Lidia's, the trying too hard, portion controlled spot in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "It breaks my heart to rate Lidia's as only a two-star experience, because I had such high expectations. On the positive side, the environment was very inviting - high ceilings with great blown-glass chandeliers; and our waitress, Paola, worked very hard. Unfortunately the kitchen staff, bussers and other servers seemed to be less dedicated to their jobs, and it appeared that Paola spent a good portion of her shift reminding her colleagues to complete their tasks - bus a table, refill waters, deliver all the entrees that were ordered. More disappointing than the service was the food, which was really underwhelming. Having watched Lidia on PBS for decades and hearing about the excellent quality of her NYC restaurant, I was looking forward to dinner in her PGH establishment. The pasta was cooked to the perfect al dente, and the portions were appropriate, but that's where the compliments end. The Ravioli di Zucca - a butternut squash ravioli with sage brown butter, zucchini and almonds - were overly sweet and were surrounded by only the barest hint of zucchini. The Fritto Misto - an appetizer of fried calamari, shrimp, and seasonal vegetables - was almost all vegetables with very few calamari or shrimp. Granted, the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly. The Porchetta - and pork shoulder roast - was dry and uninteresting. Lastly, the Pasta Trio, her signature entree, was two pastas and a risotto the evening we were there. Risotto, while one of my favorites, isn't pasta. The rice for the risotto had slightly more bite than one looks for in an al dente preparation; the ricotta filling of the tortellini was a little watery; and the bucatini pasta was only lukewarm. However, had it been actually hot, it would have been the star of the show. Each selection of the pasta trio is carried about the restaurant in large platters by separate servers, which adds a degree of showmanship, but makes it very difficult to keep them warm. Unfortunately, I believe you'll find better fare and much better service at any number of other Italian restaurants in the city.",

    "text": "Brunch is a nice way to end the weekend; you can gorge yourself one last time on food, spend some extra time with your family and friends, and even rationalize indulging in an alcoholic beverage. On the last day of her visit, my sister (who lives in Boston) suggested that we go to Lidia's for brunch.  Wait, Lidia's in the Strip has brunch?  They do indeed.   Lidia's early Sunday meal is called The Market Brunch, and is served from 11:00am to 2:00pm.  The cost of brunch is $25.00 per person, and $8.00 for children.  Before you cringe at the price, let me tell you what's included. Upon seating, we were given a fresh basket of pastries that included different varieties of scones and focaccia, all made in-house.  The bread and pastries were served with apricot jam butter, strawberry jam butter, and crunchy sugar butter.  The scones were bite-sized and moist.  The outer shell was crusty, and lightly coated with thick granules of sugar.  The focaccia was equally delicious with its heavily salted crusts and moist center. As we were enjoying our bread, the waitress appeared and took our drink orders. \"Included in your brunch price is a complimentary mimosa or bloody mary,\" she said.  After we made our cocktail selections, water, orange juice and coffee were served. Here's how brunch at Lidia's works.  Besides having a large buffet-style brunch table, you also get to order one entree of the menu.  Some of the entrees include seared salmon, tenderloin of beef, gnocchi with duck, octopus, chicken scaloppini, and wild boar raviolis.  The most popular dish on the brunch menu was the pasta-trio served tableside.  Included in the pasta dish were rigatoni, ravioli, and linguini. The most attractive aspect of the pasta trio is that it's never ending- that's right, unlimited refills! After we chose our entrees, we made our way to the buffet table.  It was covered with different salads, frittatas, fruit salads, pastas, and other antipasti- my favorite was the Caesar salad; it had plenty of anchovies, parmesan cheese and homemade croutons.  On the far side of the table was a large selection of desserts; more on that later. Our entrees arrived, and we dug in.  I ordered salmon, medium, which arrived perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The tenderloin of beef came, and I was surprised at the large portion.  The beef was ordered medium, but when we cut into it, was clearly rare.  The potato gnocchi with duck were fluffy and light, with moist strips of poultry, and finished with a sweet red sauce.  My step-dad ordered the pasta trio which was tasty, and thankfully, not over-cooked.  The chicken scaloppini came with a tangy lemon-caper sauce.  The chicken was sauteed, tender and juicy.   After our plates were cleared, it was time to go take a look at the dessert. Panna cotta, frosted brownies, fresh fruit, and homemade cookies were among the selections.  The one dessert missing; tiramisu!  I asked one of the servers where it was and she said, \"There is no tiramisu right now...\"  Talk about an ambiguous answer!  I know that there's no tiramisu now, but will there perhaps be some in the future?  No answer. If you find yourself shopping in the Strip on a Sunday morning, and become hungry, try Lidia's for Market Brunch.  The excellent service, fresh food, delicious pasta, and refreshing mimosas will surely put a smile on your face. Chef Chuck Kerber",

You sample three pastas then you can have as much as you want.  The chicken and pork ravioli was outstanding!  The pork ragu was nice...can't remember the pasta. The fazoli with shrimp was good as well...had some nuts in the sauce.  The shrimp was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  Our sons had the fried calamari with marinara.  The bread basket was plentiful and the accompaniments flavorful.  We also had the tomato soup was to die for",

Salads were great; especially the insalata misto. Salmon was perfectly cooked but a bit small of a portion. Monday night special (chicken and rigatoni) was perfect, but again small portion. The best way to get enough to eat is the all you can eat pasta that includes a Caesar salad and dessert. I'm planning my next visit already!",

Regarding the Italian sausage and polenta plate......hubby thought the polenta was great but the sausage could have been better, while I thought the sausage was great but wasn't wild about the polenta.   We were there @ 8 on a Thursday night with tired kids, so it could have been disastrous, but the service was great!!   **There is a gluten free pasta option available if needed.** Again, we didn't eat any pasta, but one of the kids is GF and I rarely find reviews that mention this so wanted to put it out there.",

Since it was inedible we went to another restaurant after that because it was so terrible and bad tasting not to mention the high price tag for terrible food.

Manager visited our table and gave nothing but excuses from him being new to Lidias, in the process of evaluating staff to being busy and understaffed. Oops, who's the manager doing the staffing? It's Saturday night! Did you not expect to be busy? I give a 2 rating only because of the service. Haven't received our meals just yet  There are fruit flies hovering around our table too. Wish I could add a photo to show the mess on our table as well.   Got here at 6:00pm, it's now 8:00 and still no main course. Uggghhhhhh!!!!!  One of our party wanted her soup boxed up to-go. It's MIA. Lol  3 out of 6 meals arrived at 8:10. Still waiting for the other three. It's now 8:13  The penne vodka is bland and has only a taste of oregano  The goat cheese stuffed ravioli is slimy  The pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio. It's an AYCE trio.   We're waiting for pasta refill. It's now 8:30 and still not even close to dessert.  I'm sure the ending doesn't get much better. Let me just end with this....haven't changed my rating of 2. At least the atmosphere was nice and the staff was pleasant regardless of service issues.  9:15pm waiting for the check........  Finally getting ready to leave and it's almost 9:30pm.. .3-1/2 hrs.. really???",

    "text": "We were very disappointed with the food during Sunday brunch at Lidia's Pittsburgh. We have been there a few times for brunch previously and found it quite good. It was surprising to find that the food has taken such a downturn. Firstly, the the two buffets have been changed. The first buffet which has different salads, cheeses and charcuterie was half the size as previously. The Cesar salad's lettuce was browned on the edges so it was not recently made. One of the plates with broiled clams was removed but never replaced with clams or an alternative. For the main I had eggplant parmesan and my husband had duck and potato hash. Both were seasoned with so much salt someone with hypertension could have gone into cardiac arrest. The eggplant was breaded so heavily I could knock on it with a knife and couldn't taste the eggplant.The sauce had an equally heavy hand, making the entire dish practically inedible. I ended up going back to the paltry salad options as I could not eat the eggplant. My husband's hash was okay, but again, the salt was overwhelming.       We had had such good experiences with the buffet and entrees before, it was nothing less than an incredible let down to see such a small buffet table with items not replaced, and for the most part, inedible entrees.        The waiter and manager were attentive. The waiter asked if we were ready for our entree, something much appreciated, as I dislike being served food one after the other with no time to talk and digest the food you've eaten prior to the next. Both the waiter and manager stopped by the table and asked about the food and service.At that point we should have advised them of the overly salted food and questioned why the buffet was half the size it used to be, but sometimes you just don't want to complain, especially while dining. Also,  the service was excellent so I didn't want to complain at that time.       We did tell the young girl at the desk near the door about our experience while leaving.. She said that she would advise staff and management on our experience and I do believe that she did.       I doubt that  we'll go to Lidia's again. If the executive and sous chef are letting this sort of food leave their kitchen without having them redone before service they need new chefs. I'd also like to know why there was such a heavy cut back on the salad/charcuterie buffet. There used to be pasta, seafood salads and a good cheese selection. It not only is half the size but it was upsetting that staff did not replace the dishes as they should have, including entirely empty plates      We are frequent diners of the restaurants in Pittsburgh. But sorry, Lidia's. We always had enjoyed our brunch there but will now look for other places for brunch and lunch and dinner.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to eating here, and it was right next door to our hotel. I booked a table for 3 at 7pm. We showed up at 7pm and the place was mostly empty. Our table was not ready, so they left us standing at the door with others to wait. It took about 15 minutes to ready the table.  I saw a great beer, Victory Golden Monkey on the menu, but alas it had been replaced with some beer called \"White lightning\"....ummm no thanks.  We got some starters to share. The burrata was pretty small, we each got just more than one decent bite of it...tough to share. $12 seems high for about 4 bites. We also got the Fritto Misto. It was a decent size serving, but it had 3 tiny shrimp and 3 pieces of calamari. The rest was all veg.  For entrees, our son got the gnocci with duck. It looked like the best entree of all, and he was pleased with it. My wife had the Friday special Cacciatore. The chicken was a bit over done, but the strange thing was that it came with a giant serving of polenta. Each piece of chicken was on a large square of it. It was way too much to eat on that plate. Seemed strange. I got the heritage pork chop. The server said it would be medium. It was actually med-well, and a bit past done making it a little dry. The pork was flavorful, but it showed a lack of care in the preparation. 140F is right for good pork, this was probably 150F. We got a side of zucchini and corn, and that was really good.  We finished with sorbets and ice cream.  The service is decent here, not too pushy or fake. I liked that. One last note is that this restaurant had an odd, unclean smell to it. I noted elsewhere that folks commented about flies, and sure enough, there were flies buzzing around during our meal. These all seem like they should be simple to fix, but again point to a lack of focus, which one should expect from a famous chef.",

The server was really nice which I appreciate because sometimes servers aren't nice to teens (these guys work in service and tip good). But the main reason I'm leaving this review is to say how great the valet was. When the kids came out he told them that the cat was leaking gas and that they shouldn't drive it (excellent advice). He let us leave the car until I could get a tow and he called his friend who is a mechanic to try to figure out the issue -- he was just super nice and helpful and really kind to the kids.",

    "text": "4.5 stars Had a lovely anniversary dinner here with my hubby (first year of marriage behind us, all downhill from here lol). I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant from the moment we stepped in - old warehouse turned into a cozy place with beautiful built-ins on the wall and cool glass fixtures. Reminded me a bit of our first apartment, so I was instantly excited that we chose Lidias for the special occasion.   We were promptly greeted by a server with water and a tasty bread basket. I loved that the bread is served with a black olive tapenade and pesto as well as olive oil. Added an extra level of quality and tasted awesome on the fresh breads. I was then pleasantly surprised to see a $32 wine list. My hubby doesn't care much for wine, but encourages me to order a bottle if it's a special occasion. I always feel bad spending too much, so this was a perfect option. The waitress helped me choose a dry white wine that was very nice with our meals.  The entree was wonderful as well. I almost always order frutti di mare at Italian restaurants so was pleased to find a similar dish on the menu - zuppa di pesce. Incredibly flavorful broth with delicate little bites of pasta and seafood cooked to perfection. I would definitely order it again next time.  My hubby had the pasta trio and loved the mushroom ravioli that they were featuring.  My only gripe is that the tables were reallllly close together. The waitstaff couldn't even get between the tables to fill our drinks or bring pasta servings. I know from a business standpoint, you want to maximize your seating, but it went a little overboard. It was also Valentine's Day weekend so  they may have split 4 tops into 2 tops, leaving less space in between than usual. I'll have to pay attention next time I done there.",

I have to say that I was expecting so much more when it comes to the quality of the food! The antipasto bar was very nice with a wide selection. The fish of the day was a little dry, nothing special about it. We also had the pasta trio. The rigatoni were okay, the fettuccine al olio was not the greatest however the gnocchi made with the duck Ragu was incredible. I also wasn't very impressed with the dessert selections. The tiramisu needed to be spiked with a little more espresso and some liquor.  It was nice to have a mimosa or sangria included in the price of the brunch but I think that the espresso should also be included.

My kids and I visited Lidia's the night before Easter and were blown away by everything from the atmosphere to the service to the food.  Our server, Becky, was hilarious and bent over backward to meet our every need. BIG plus.  We started with drinks--the kids with Lidia's Italian sodas (vanilla cream and blackberry sage) and I with an orange Manhattan. I'd substitute another bourbon for Maker's next time, but it was reallllly good.   While we waited for the appetizer course, we were offered a selection of fresh-baked breads (grissini with grana padano, focaccia, and a sturdy Tuscan bread), served with kalamata olive-cannellini bean and basil pesto spreads. SO good.   Our first course was Burrata with broccoli rabe, olive oil, and grilled bread. The Flavors were bright, fresh, and fabulous.  My daughter got the pasta trio (a solid choice in my estimation), which included penne with sausage and caramelized onions, ravioli with thyme-butter sauce, and fettuccine with basil pesto. YUM.  My son went with house garganelli pasta, lemon garlic cream, crispy fried shrimps, chives, toasted pine nuts. Holy CATS, it was good.  I had gnocchi with braised duck ragu. It was to DIE for.  Dessert featured tiramisu, Nutella budino with candied hazelnuts, and Zuppa Inglese which was a crazy good melange of amaretto-soaked sponge cake, pastry cream and pistachio cream with raspberry sorbetto, lemon custard sauce, fresh raspberries and candied almonds. There is a God, clearly.  We had a GREAT time. Lots of jokes and smiles from the wait staff, a relaxed atmosphere, and FANTASTIC food. Just right. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Decided to go here since it was close to our hotel. Menu looked great. Atmosphere looked amazing and there was Lidia's cookbook on the host stand as we entered. Tons of potential! Waitress was pretty good. Staff seemed really nice. However the food was very disappointing. We did the trio special for the night that was hyped up. Salad course was good but we found brown lettuce. Pastas were: surprisingly good ravioli, under cooked bowtie farfalle (we prefer aldente - this was crunchy), and I could have done better at home hamburger helper. It was very disappointing. Dessert since we ordered a three course package was the best part but wasn't supper fresh. We told the waitress about our visit. She was understanding and tried to make it up to use with a free homemade lemoncello and orange-cello. Both were lost on us since we don't like anise. Maybe better luck next time. Both of us passed on a short rib plate and lobster pasta plate for the special three course meal. Overall regretted our decisions.",

Too bad the food wasn't good.  The beet salad was underwhelming.  I had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  I felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  I suspect such positive memories are no longer :(  My other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  Another disappointment.     And thus my rating of Meh. Which is a huge shame.  But life goes on...",

    "text": "Order the pasta trio and you can't go wrong! I looove to go here for lunch and get the pasta trio. For lunch, you get unlimited servings of three different pastas (one of which is imported from Italy) brought out fresh and served table-side from the skillet plus soup or salad for $14. Their Caesar salad is delicious and they offer some unique soups which are a refreshing change from the normal wedding soup or minestrone. It might be on the high side for lunch but it's well worth it!   Warning:  you may want to nap when you get back to your desk.  They also serve fresh breads with spreads. I prefer the green spread which is a bean base and contains who knows what else. The dinner pasta trio is a little more expensive ($18 for just the pasta or $29.50 w/salad, trio and dessert).   I've had soooo many different pastas there, I couldn't begin to name them all. Some of my favorites include the pear ravioli, goat cheese ravioli, penne a la vodka, penne arrabiata, gnocchi in a Gorgonzola sauce and the list continues. They typically serve one pasta that contains meat and two meatless pastas but they'll make a third meatless pasta for all those vegetarians out there. I don't typically order off the menu but I've had the salmon and been pleased.   I also recommend their brunch. It's $25 per person and includes a variety of anti pasta (probably a rotating sample of 10 or so that includes anything from soup, Caesar salad, various other salads, meat trays, bean based dishes, marinated vegetables, quiche, etc), fresh breads with an assortment of flavored butters (strawberry jam butter is my fav), one mimosa or bloody mary, the pasta trio or some other entree, coffee or tea, and a table full of various desserts for sampling. You can't go wrong. We go here for brunch when family is visiting and everybody looooves it! I recommend making a reservation for brunch.   They don't rush you through your meal which means that service can be a little slower than your typical restaurant but with the pasta trio in your future, you won't regret it.",

Three out of five of us got it (the others had the osso buco and a pasta dish - the osso buco was good, and the pasta dish was a \"meh\") and I just wanted to put my face behind my hands and whimper out of embarrassment.  The dish was totally watered down and not flavorful at all.  I did ask for it to be made a little less spicy, and I think their solution to that was to dilute the sauce.  But, another one of us had the entree at full strength, and it wasn't much better!  I was questioned as to whether I would come back again, and I suppose I would answer yes to that, but only if someone else wanted to go.

However, she never asked us why all of our plates were not touched when she took them from the table.  The reason....the pasta was so salty and over-seasoned none of us could stomach it. We had their pasta sampler and all three dishes were similar with the salt or whatever it was that ruined the dish.    I haven't been here in almost 6 years and now I remember why.

It's spacious yet feels warm, inviting, and comfortable.  There are beautiful touches and accents everywhere and the designer was not afraid to use color, tastefully.  I was ready to feast!  I ordered the polipo (grilled octopus) which was tender and flavorful thanks to the zesty vinaigrette.  My osso bucco (braised pork shank) on a bed of barley risotto was easily the tastiest thing I ate that night being succulent, flavorful and utterly tender.  That's not to demean my companion's hearty and tasty mushroom soup or his grilled salmon which was prepared quite nicely.   I ordered the budino di nutella (nutella pudding) for dessert.  It looked better on the menu unfortunately.  It was bit too heavy and rich.  Did I really say that?  Lesson learned...perhaps.  Probably not.  Service is top notch.  We never waited and our food came out promptly.  Prices are extremely reasonable given the quality and copious portions they serve.  In fact, I think I went up a full pant size upon leaving.  Lidia's is a definite keeper.",

    "text": "Overall experience was rather good. This is an impressive review for me to give a restaurant as I consider myself an avid foodie. It is rare for me to give an Italian restaurant a rave review, since I grew up eating Italian-American homemade meals.   The ambiance was nice, the buzz was slightly nosier than I would have liked but it was also not so much so to be considered bothersome. Their staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I will say, it was a little strange to not receive a menu until after we were served water and bread sticks. I can actually say I've never been seated at a restaurant where it took 15 minutes to receive one. However, after munching on the delightful breadbasket (The star of which is definitely the Focaccia bread) left me excited for what was yet to come.   I enjoyed the affordable wine selection. We order an Italian table wine style Pinot Noir. It was delightful and we would order it again.  For an appetizer we shared the Capesante: grilled sea scallops, shaved fennel, red onion, orange and basil. My husband and I rarely go out to eat without ordering some sort of scallop dish.  I can proudly say, their scallops had a lovely sear and were cooked perfectly inside.   For my entree, I ordered the Lidia's Pasta Trio which is their signature dish.  Unlimited daily pasta selection served table-side. I must confess, I found the serving via table-side a little odd. If they served only my portion from the pan it would not have been as off. But thinking that others may have or will be served from that same dish that is inches away from the diner was a bit off. I had the linguine w/ walnut pesto which was average nothing too spectacular but good all around. The chicken, pork ravioli was interesting. Tastier that I expected. In fact, had I not tried my husband's entree I would have been more impressed with my ravioli. Lastly, it was served w/ eggplant penne in a red sauce. I was probably least underwhelmed by this last dish. But nevertheless, all three pastas far supersede the majority of Pittsburgh Italian restaurants.   I order this with the Caesar salad and choice of dessert. The salad was okay. Admittedly, I'm a hard sell with Caesar as I prefer to make it myself. Unless of course I am eating it from Emeril's (Las Vegas) which was the best Caesar I've ever eaten. Bygones.  For dessert, I ordered the Torta d'Ananas- ricotta and butter cake, caramelized pineapple, Amarena cherries, and coconut ice cream. If I had to guess, the cherries were present in syrup form perhaps on the top of the cake. As I did not see any cherries (or taste for that matter) their presence within the dish. Perhaps the syrup was used sparingly. Nevertheless, the dish was yummy. The coconut ice cream with the caramelized pineapple was the star. However, I do not think it was spectacular enough to order again.  My husband had the Ravioli di Cinghale: ravioli filled with braised wild boar in a rosemary infused sauce. This dish was amazing. I could not believe how delicious every single aspect of this dish was. The ravioli looked so fresh, it appear made to order. Significantly, far exceeded the quality present in the Trio I ordered. The rosemary infused sauce was one of the most incredible sauces I have EVER eaten. The wild boar itself, was absolutely to die for. My husband and I swore we would be back, simply for us both to eat this dish again. It is a MUST HAVE. Enjoy!",

Decor and service were just fine, no issues there.   But the food was something I would expect from a chain restaurant like Carrabba's or Olive Garden. The quality seemed poor: bread was soggy, greens and salad dressings way over salted, greasy, sloppy pasta sauces, and huge portions just slapped onto dirty plates with greasy fingerprints all over the edges. Plus, I spent the entire meal swatting flies away from our table.  I was really puzzled by this experience. When you dine at Joe's restaurants, you get the sense that every single ingredient is hand selected for the highest quality and the presentation of the food shows care went into it.  I expected a similar standard at Lidia's. I wondered if Lidia visits this restaurant often and whether she knows about the quality of the food. Celebrity chefs often seem to suffer from this issue: they get involved in so many business ventures and if they are not at the restaurants regularly, the quality suffers.  Sorry to say it, but I definitely won't be back to Lidia's.",

Seen her on TV many times and was really happy to have the chance to eat at one of her restaurants.    Appetizers: frico with house made sausage and broccoli rabe, fritto misto.  Both were good, with the frico being the standout for me.  Think rustic quesadilla, but the cheese is melted and fashioned into the shell.  Yum.    Main: Mushroom Stuffed Quails and Cotechino Sausage with Cannellini Beans and Swiss-Chard.  Loved it.  Dining companions enjoyed the pasta trio (neverending bowl of house-made selections) as well as the fish special (Brazilian tiger fish).  17 bucks for house-made pasta, and as much as you want, is a great deal.  No entree was priced over 26 bucks, which was fair.  Big portions for sure.  Didn't have room for dessert or coffee, but the server brought out a complimentary biscotti plate served with an affogato \"dipping sauce\" for the group to share anyway. Very classy and was appreciated.  Overall: a wonderfully warm-yet-modern dining room, attentive service, a great value, and a very good meal.  Would have to visit a few more times and eat some more things to give it the full five stars, but am absolutely looking forward to the opportunity to do just that.  Oh, the wine list, which is wholly Italian varietals, has a little something for everyone.  I s'pose son Joe B. had a little to do with that!  Grazie, Lidia. I can now happily say that I have been able to accept your warm invitation at the end of each show (Tutti a tavola a mangiare).  Looking forward to the next opportunity.",

However, after going back and getting the same dish and ALSO trying their brunch- I would have to say that Lidia's wasn't as good as I originally thought it was.   I personally find the pre-fixe brunch menu over priced, simply because you can get better brunch pre-fixe menus around the area for the same price.   The pastas are OK- but I guess the last time I went it didn't taste as good as the first time! (I got the almond pesto spaghetti). The decor is great and I would say that the huge bar is most definitely impressive.   Hopefully the next time I go back (if there is a next time) my opinion will change.",

    "text": "Oh man... our meal today was pretty sad. I used to work at this restaurant many years ago and back then it was by far one of the best meals in town.... not any more   Octopus salad- The octopus was under seasoned and poorly charred. The other elements in the salad were decent at best.   Caesar Salad- This salad hasn't changed in 20 years and it's still very good.  Pasta Trio-  this is what I came for! Their pasta used to be amazing! My \"gemelli\" was actually boxed fusilli with a marinara that tasted like it came from a jar that had been open in the back of the fridge for 2 weeks. No love. Nothing special. It was pretty much a kids pasta. The other 2 pastas were ok.... but 16 tablespoons of butter will help almost any dish.   We also ordered a glass of red wine and I wish I had taken a picture... it was a 4oz pour at best in a cheap glass.... it was funny to even look at it.   I also ordered a glass of port (desert wine) that showed up in a low ball glass  also funny to look at.   We had dirty glasses, cheese and salt on the table right up until the end. 3 different people came by the table and not one of them maintained it for us. What happened to the table crumbers? We had a pile of spilled cheese on there for over an hour (I don't really care that much, but this place is not cheap!!!)   We had to get up and order our final course at the bar which earned us 1 free dessert.... the Tiramisu hasn't changed either and is still the best.   In the end it cost us $120 to eat a hilariously overpriced and under seasoned lunch. My days of visiting Lidia's when I visit Pittsburgh are over which blows.  I've been coming here for over 15years.   This place has taken a nose dive. The 2 starts are for the waiter who did very well considering that he was the only waiter for nearly 10 tables..... there were at least 6 other employees on the floor and most of them were doing there best to help out.",

The food was still decent, but the service was seriously lacking. It's too bad this place can't update its dining room so it doesn't seem like a tacky road stop restaurant.",

Finally, the bread basket is killer good.  But that's all that we enjoyed. For a Thursday lunch, with the fact that they offer a lunch special, I expected to have a quick, fantastic meal - and that's not what happened at all.  Our first course took forever to come out. My salad was little more than overdressed lettuce with one crouton. My friend's soup cup was only filled halfway and was tepid.   For the second course, my son's grilled cheese and fries, as well as my friend's panini and fries, were very very greasy (with the over-sized cut of the fries, I wonder why they didn't roast them instead of frying anyway). My baked ziti and meatballs was also very greasy, with oil pooled underneath and pretty chewy pasta.  For the final dessert course, we, again, waited forever for food that should have come out right away. In fact, nothing on our plates took more than a little arranging to prepare. Yes, the dessert was very tasty - just not enough to make the whole meal better.  I have to say that we were very disappointed. The jury is still out on whether I would go back for a second chance. For now, Lidia's isn't on my list.",

We really appreciated how patient and helpful the staff were.  We went to Lidia's with a small group on Mother's Day - needed to have reservations- the place was packed. It is great for big groups.

For entrees, we ordered the Costeletta and the unlimited pasta trio. My daughter was totally thrilled with the pasta trio. Tonight's trio was composed of 4 cheese ravioli, farfalle with pesto and tagliatelle bolognese.  That combo hit all the right flavor notes for my daughter.  The big pork chop was flavorful.  It was a good size and well prepared. We finished with 2 desserts.  A Tiramisu and the gelato & sorbetto trio.  Both tasted excellent.   My one disappointment was the size of the 3 gelato & sorbetto scoops.  They seemed a little too nouvelle cuisine portioned for the $9 price.    The service seemed to require a tune-up.  I had to flag down a server to get a knife for my Costeletta.  My knife was cleared away with the salad plates and never replaced.  While waiting to catch a servers attention, I finished half of the vegetables on my plate.  Also, when our dessert came out, the server seemed to be lost trying to find the correct table.  Not being certain whether he had our dessert, I volunteered an \"is that our Tiramisu and Gelato.\"   It was.   I've been to Lidia's NY restaurants and their service has always been attentive and flawless.  I've been to both Becca and Felidia more than once.  This is my first visit to this location. I may have just hit a bump on a busy Saturday night.",

My husband suggested Lidia's because we had both heard that they redid the interior and the menu recently, and neither of us had been there before.  First of all, we were very underdressed in our PJ pants and hoodies (again, we had just gotten off of an overnight flight), but I asked the hostess if it was a problem and explained the situation and she insisted that I was over-reacting (I still don't think I was). So, they sat us immediately and told us about the specials, which included an all you can eat 4 different pasta tasting menu... YES PLEASE! So obviously, we both got that. I don't eat meat and they were more than happy to actually make me a whole other option (I just expected 3 instead of 4 pastas) AND they let me pick what I wanted! Needless to say, customer service is amazing.  The pasta was great. My husband and I both liked the plain marinara the best, but I think it might have just been the first down home-American thing we had eaten in a week so we both liked it!  Everything here was great, they made us feel welcome even though we looked like crazy people, and the food was amazing!",

The salmon was medium temperature like it was out of the cooler since an hour and the buratta was cold as it should be but the combination didn't work for me the toast that came with it was a minimum of 2 days old. As a main dish I ordered the famous 3 pastas. Horrible. The shrimp pasta was not eatable and was made with little frozen shrimps. It was just not eatable. The ragu was actually ok and the ravioli was not bad. But that shrimp pasta with coliflower( who invents these combinations?) was just so bad. Kitchen should be about simplicity, freshness and respect for the product and not a frozen shrimp pasta with colliflower",

The pasta trio is a fun novelty, though you're most likely going to order only one of each pasta - even if they're all tasty - simply because it's a lot of food. I did almost get a second helping of ravioli, but opted not to do so because most of it would have gone to waste. The penne wasn't that great  and I only had a bite or two. I did enjoy the parpadelle as well. H had the manicotti and that was very yummy. Definitely worth getting if you're not up for the novelty of the trio experience.

The breads and spreads are fantastic. One tasted like deep fried pie crust. Yum. For brunch you visit the buffet for antipasti, soup and desserts, you choose from the menu for the main course. My friend had the pasta trio and I had the lemon chicken. One of the pastas was a lamb ragout ziti. Really good, so was the gnocchi, the third was a linguini, the sauce was a little dry. My chicken dish was really good, tender chicken. Needed a touch more lemon for my taste but that's nit picky.  The antipasti I and dessert tables were very good as well. Warmed olives? Yes. Delish! All of the salads were great. I liked the tiramisu and ginger cookies from the dessert table.  I would visit again most definitely.",

    "text": "Three of us had dinner at 8:30 on a Friday night.  Started with a drink at the bar, and were impressed with the bartender's knowledge and service--a great start!  We asked for help with our wine selection, and the knowledgable sommelier helped us choose a lovely Italian red; another positive step.  It was downhill from there.  We were slow to order and our waitress was patient, but we didn't get bread until about 15 seconds before our entrees appeared, and 2 of our 3 specialty salads were missing key ingredients.  Our waitress offered to replace them, but since we'd already rolled through most of the plates by the time she checked on us, she removed one of them from our bill instead.  Pasta trio was unimpressive, ziti was quite dry and fettuccini cooked nearly to mush.  Lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just OK.  Desserts were nice.  Bus staff mostly ignored us, 2 of them actually started a little spat while sitting at a table next to us--our poor waitress had to intervene and did most of the cleanup herself.  I'm sad to give a poor review to a restaurant with such a great food icon as its namesake, but I can't recommend this place.",

    "text": "visited Lidia's recently while in Pittsburgh for business. I was alone so opted to eat at the bar. The cocktail (Manhattan) was perfectly made although they could use a bigger selection of rye to choose from. The endive salad and the osso bucco were very good. The portions were much to big for me but you can always take a box home. The wine special from one of the families estates was perfect. The barroom was separated from the rest of the restaurant and was very comfortable with tasteful furnishings and particularly quiet even though their were a number of patrons, 2 bartenders and baseball on the monitor set into the back bar. I want to give a special shout out for Anand, my bartender and foodserver. This young man was informed, attentive, friendly and skilled. Truly an asset to my experience.",

We each opted for the pasta trio. Sounded like a good deal, so why not?  The sangria was good. The little buffet of sorts was a total let down. Bread and flavored butters on the table were pretty good.  As for the pasta... More landed on my fiance and sisters clothes than did land on their plates. 2/3 were complete duds. The pesto was pretty good.   Service was okay at best. Nothing was done about the spillage, so I wonder if this a regular occurrence. If so, find better servers because if you don't, you'll be losing a lot of business.  I'd consider coming for dinner, maybe, next time I'm in town.",

Everything we had was delicious, every little salad and nibble bit on the antipasti table.  I had the gnocchi with duck ragu as my main course, and it was perfection; if I can quibble, the portion was actually too large!  But--perfection!  My partner had the chicken livers with polenta, which was also super.  We sampled a few of the offerings on the dessert table, all of which were lovely.  The roasted half peaches with crumble topping were the best, although I also loved the olive oil/lemon cake topped with sugar coated blueberries.  We had such a nice experience here, and ordered why we don't go that often.  We will have to get here more often, based on yesterday's peerless experience.",

Unfortunately, the 5 times I've been to the place in different occasions, Lidia's fails to live up to the reputation of its chef/owner. The food overall is good, but not outstanding and certainly not something to brag about. The pasta at times, is way too much. Sometimes, the tomato sauce is too acidic. Their redeeming entrees: Osso Buco and Anitra. Everything else is forgettable. One wonder's whether Lidia or Joe themselves ever inspect this restaurant!!!",

The menu had some great choices, will definitely go back again to try other dishes.  It's a bit pricey ($100 for two meals, a split appetizers and two drinks each) but worth it.  Probably wouldn't take my kids here, but would be a great date spot.  It's spacious and even when it's crowded, it's not too loud.  Service is very good, food came out at a reasonable pace.",

Their service is good and the interior is clean and simple.  However, I would have like it better if they took it easy on the salt with everything and if the chicken breast was a little less chewy. It might also help to lower the price and lessen the portions. It was too much to eat. I'm not sure yet if I'd go again given the other options in Pittsburgh. I'd like to try the other items on the menu but it's too pricey if I'm to expect the same kind of food as last time.",

    "text": "This review is way overdue, as I've gone to Lidia's for years now.  Unfortunately, our last experience was probably about two months ago, and we haven't had any desire to go back.  I actually really like the food and cocktails there (we only ever get the pasta trio, and whereas it's not the most exquisite fine dining pasta, it's the novelty of different combinations of flavor each time that always kept us interested).  Also, because of the fact that we only get the pasta trio, we've never had an issue with service...always very attentive.  So take that for what it's worth.  The only reason we won't go back is because of an isolated incident the last time we were there.  One of the tables next to us had a drunk, belligerent older couple (the man was belligerent, the woman just sat there).  They were literally screaming at the waitress (the same as ours), and at one point the man even grabbed her by the arm.  When she returned to our table, she had been clearly crying and upset, so we apologized for how horribly she had been treated.  He continued to scream at the female manager that approached him, throwing f-bombs all over the place.  Everyone was staring, the tables around us all said they wanted to skip coffee and dessert and get their checks so they could get out of there.  There were even groups with small children having to witness this.  Then the male manager approached and this angry old man was finally ok talking to another man.  Within fifteen minutes they were laughing and joking and all was well with the world.  For that table at least.  They had how many other tables uncomfortable, not wanting to continue the meal, ready to escape, but that horribly behaved table got rewarded.  There is a limit to the customer being always right...at some point, a line can be crossed, and in this case, that happened several times.  I strongly feel the manager made a poor decision, and despite liking the food there, we've moved on to other places around the 'burgh.",

Lidia's food was pretty good, but the service was just average and for the price of pasta, they weren't very accommodating to special requests.  Most of our group ordered the three pasta special. After the first round of pasta came by it seemed to take forever to get another round. The dessert I was hoping to get was 'reserved' for those ordering a special dinner that night, and when I ordered a glass of 'a dry red wine that's a bit oaky' I ended up with a somewhat sweet cabernet.  While the pasta that did come to the table was excellent, it wouldn't be enough to sway me back.",

We tried the 3 pasta special & while the pastas were homemade, there was only one on the plate we actually finished.  One had sun-dried tomatoes, but the tomatoes were overwhelming.  Another had artichokes, but they were bits of the actual leaves rather than the meat or heart of the artichoke & so eatiing it was trying to chew through those fibrous leaves & it was abandoned.    The 3rd was a butternut squash which, while tasty, was a smidge sweet, but it was the only one we finished.    The caeser salad was fresh romaine & a delicious dressing.  We had to try the tiramisu.  I know that it's typically made with leftover ladyfingers but I've gotten used to having fairly fresh ones & these tasted stale.  They also weren't layered uniformly, so about half of it didn't even have any.  We ordered a bottle of wine, but they didn't have what was listed (which always perturbs me).  Overall, my take is that it could be a fantastic restaurant, but more for the tourist crowd.  I might try it again for lunch.",

We have only been on weeknights, and with reservations, however, so I'm not at all discrediting the reviews that discussed poor service on weekend nights and/or without reservations.  The pasta trio special was good when I had it, but my favorite dish is the gnocchi with duck ragu. I also loved my husband's wild boar ravioli. Skip the overpriced wine and order one of the house sodas instead. The ginger cranberry is fabulous!  We also love love love the frico and burrata appetizers. The frico is large and rich enough that it's really enough for two people, but the appetizers are yummy, so everyone might as well get their own and bring home whatever they can't finish.    Note to parents of babies, this restaurant is very family friendly, in our experience. We loved bringing our infant daughter here and were pleased that the restaurant offers slings for carseats for the smaller babies as well as highchairs for babies who are of sitting up age (many places don't have the slings). The lady's room and its changing station were very clean. The staff often stopped to smile back at the baby when she was smiling at them, and our waiter asked if we needed anything for her. Not necessary, but very nice, and appreciated.  They have valet parking, but we just park about a block away and walk, since we sometimes enjoy walking further down the strip district, anyway.",

Before I get to my review of the brunch itself I'd like to say how impressed I was with their accommodations for babies! The changing station in the bathroom had wipes, a small sitting area and it was almost private. Fabulous. But the best part was they gave us a cradle-type thing in which our baby slept like the angel he is most certainly not. If he wasn't sleeping in it, he was just laying there playing and we could have brunch with our adult friends without having to entertain or keep an eye on our little love. Thanks Lidia's - you won me over with those two things alone.  The brunch itself was fantastic. The bread with three sweet, butter spreads was my favorite. My mimosa was actually a mimosa and not just orange juice with a splash of champagne. The buffet was 90%vegetarian and never looked empty because the staff was always bringing out new dishes. For my entree I had the manicotti but also tasted the pasta trio from my friend. Yumm! And the dessert spread? Yeah I was in heaven.   Overall, we had an amazing time and will def be back.",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Lidia Bastianich for years, watching her show on PBS and cooking her recipes. My Dad is a huge fan as well. I recently moved back to Pittsburgh (after 30 years) to help out my folks as my Dad's cancer has worsened. I had no idea Lidia had a restaurant here. About a month ago I met a college friend (and foodie) at the strip for drinks and we ended up at Lidia's. Bar is awesome - I highly recommend the white Manhattans. While I was there I found out Lidia would be in town for a special dinner, Nov. 7. Woot! Gonna go and bring my Mom and Dad.  So happy I could make my reservation online! The restaurant was very professional and called to confirm (beating me to call them) and then accommodated us with a table closer to the door so my Dad, who has a walker, would not have to walk so far.  Said table was very cozy against the wall, the arrangement was perfect. The greeting and seating staff were excellent and friendly. My Mom and Dad bought her latest cook in anticipation. Upon seating, Lidia was bee bopping around and we said hello and she promised to come back to visit.  The meal, the MEAL! Yum, holy moly! To start, I had a white Manhattan, of course, and enjoyed the yummy bread-sticks. I also ate some of the homemade bread (one was rosemary I think) with pesto butter and a bean butter. Had to save room! We did not order wine, my Dad can't drink wine due to his medication. The meal was paired with Lidia's own wine, another time I would love to try some. Since I was driving I only had one cocktail. ; p  The antipasti - squash and ricotta tart was to die for, the mozzarella and celery salad was wonderful. For Primi, my Mom had Lidia's signature Ceasar salad, my Dad had the tomato and ricotta crostini. I had the ricotta and vegetable crostata with arugula salad. I loved mine, the crostata again so excellent, the arugula salad was warm served on a warm plate. Had a bite of my parent's Primi. It's always good to go with others, so you can share and try out more dishes!  The pasta was Ravioli verde with sage butter - delectable! The ravioli looked more like beautiful speckled green meatballs and melted in your mouth.  For Secondi, I had Lidia's Pasta trio, my favorite of which was the homemade pappardelle with cabbage and meat sauce. My Dad had the pork shanks braised in apple cider vinegar and barley risotto (my other choice) and my Mom had the lamb chops with red wine sauce and spinach spaetzle. The pork was luscious and the lamb chops were delicious too.  Dolci was outstanding as well, my parents had the Grandma Rose's apple cake with candied walnuts (those were awesome - they were coated with a marzipan type coating). I had the Caprese Torte which was chocolate and divine. All served with a dollop of mascarpone ice cream, so good!  Lidia came back over and chatted for awhile with my Dad (and my Mom and me) and signed their cookbook. They talked about cooking and where in Italy they are from and the slovak influence of their youth. Her's in far north Italy, his in a coal town in PA with Italian and Slovak neighbors. Magical.  The service was superb. The only sour notes were the din of the restaurant (everyone was excited!) and the \"bull in the china shop\" busboy (man). He actually splashed matter into my Dad's eye piling dishes and utensils on his arm busing the table next to us. It was fine, no harm, no foul and he was very nice, as was everyone on staff.  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "My friend and I ate lunch here today. Went in with an open mind after reading several different reviews. They started us out with bread and olive oil with a pesto spread and a chickpea-tapinad olive spread. Both spreads were delicious. I had the pasta trio. It included either a Ceasar salad or soup. I had the soup. It was an onion, smoked bacon, and tomato soup. All the flavors came through and was amazing. The pasta trio included penne with a tomato sauce, sausage, and peppers, ravioli stuffed with clam and leeks, and a thick spaghetti with a pesto sauce. All of them were very good. The pastas were cooked beautifully.  The spaghetti had a nice bite to it. Each accompanying sauce was flavorful especially the penne and ravioli.  The pesto with the spaghetti was good too. The tomato sauce with the penne had a hint of what seemed like cinnamon.  So good! Delicious. I would definitely have the trio again.   My friend had the gnocchi with duck ragu. It was delicious as well. Very flavorful. I had the tiramisu for dessert. It was very good. It had good flavor but was not overly sweet as so many tiramisus I've tried have been. It had a custardy texture which was very nice. I would definitely have it again as well.    Lastly the service was fantastic. Our hostess was very nice and polite.  Our waitress Kelly was amazing! She was informative, friendly, attentive, and fun!  Our experience here was awesome! We will definitely be back. Loved it!",

    "text": "i've dined in other lidia restaurants in the past and had wonderful meals and service.  the pittsburg location wasn't even an honorable mention in my opinion. we spent $190 on dinner for three (2 appetizers , 2 cocktails, 3 entrees and 2 desserts )and were very diappponted.  friday night fare not terribly busy but practically had to send up a rescue flare to get out water glasses refilled to mention only one part of the poor service.  no bread on table -had to ask for it half way through our appetizer course , calamari appetizer had no kidding i think 4-5 small pieces of squid with the rest being breaded yams and turnips -wtf i ordered calamari and for 14 bucks should have some squid .  my wife's seafood soup entree (fruita he mare) had barely enough broth to cover the bottom of the bowl and the seafood tasted like it may have been fresh 3 days ago.  waiter never came over to ask if we needed anything -ever-had to ask other servers zipping by just for some fresh ground pepper.  i don't mind dropping 200 bucks on a good meal but this place was ridiculous.   steer clear.  Lidia if you review these yelps please do something about it. i am full blooded second generation italian american and cook good italian meals myself so i know decent food.  so disappointed in this place.  wish i reviewed other fellow yelp reviews but probably wouldn't of believed them until going in for myself.",

    "text": "Firstly, SHAME ON OTHER REVIEWERS FOR PUBLICLY SHAMING TAMMY (\"the toothless busser\"). She works incredibly hard, does a great job, has a lovely personality, and should be lauded. You think she's unaware that she's missing teeth? Do you think she's proud of it, or that she wouldn't correct it if she could? How dare you insinuate that another human being isn't worthy to pick up your dirty dishes. You're pathetic.  After having grown up watching Lidia cook on PBS, both my girlfriend and I had high hopes for our pilgrimage from Cleveland to Lidia's Pittsburgh. Our experience did not disappoint, and our dishes (duck ragu gnocchi & pasta trio) tasted how we always imagined Lidia's cooking would. Not that we think she was actually in the kitchen...  Contrary to other reviews, all four of the sauces we tried were rich, complex, and had that perfect texture that separates your average Italian restaurant from an authentic experience. Similarly, the pasta was delicate, flavorful, and served al dente. The tiramisu is a must - best I've had on this continent.",

Hard to cook a batch evenly at home, not to mention the splatters all over the cooktop, Lidia's does all the work (and cleanup). Excellent service at the bar, along with a great beer and the chicken livers were cooked just right. Hot, tender and flavorful.  Lidia's Brunch is our favorite, but sometimes you get an urge for just one item.   Thanks to the friendly folks at Lidia's. My stomach loves you. Worth the trip.",

Sat at the table for nearly ten minutes, forgotten until a bus boy brought water, five minutes after that we finally receive menus.  We're a party of two, not so complicated.  We order drinks, and one is completely forgotten.  That's alright, water is healthier for me anyways.  On the not so healthy side we had the pasta trio dinner which was amazing.  $18(Aug 2011) and $29.50 if you add Caesar salad and dessert.  The ravioli was by far the best.  Perhaps we didn't have the best service, but we'll always give them a second shot.  They had valet parking, but we lucked out and found street parking.",

However, if you aren't a fan of those you will definitely be able to find something, but it isn't exactly what I was hoping for. I got the manicotti which was fine but not great. The prices are a little much and I think that you can get the same sort of food much cheaper at another popular Italian restaurant. You can call a couple hours ahead to find out about the trio options, which I think is a good idea. If you don't like those however recommend going somewhere else and saving your money.  It is also frustrating that you don't get any salad or any sort of side with your pasta entrees.",

    "text": "Three of us had dinner here during a little getaway trip to Pittsburgh. The decor was a bit more impressive than the service and the food were. Not that they were bad. They just didn't quite meet my expectations.  First, even though we had a reservation, it couldn't be found. Then it was, but it was on the \"wait list\". Then we were seated right away..... but away from the hubbub of the main dining room at a table between the bar and the kitchen.   The wine list (including MANY wines by the glass) was  nice. The waiter suggested a fantastic dry white for me, but I was disappointed when I wanted a second glass and there wasn't any more. The next suggestion wasn't nearly as good.  The waiter seemed a bit frazzled at times. Maybe because he sometimes functioned as a bartender (our table location gave us that behind the scenes view). Sometimes our used plates sat for a l-o-n-g time and sometimes (like when we were not asked if we wanted refills on the \"Pasta Trio\" they were oh so efficiently whisked away.  The bread brought to the table was wonderful, as were the spreads that accompanied it. One of my dining companions had the octopus appetizer which he stated was the best he's ever had... and he eats LOTS of weird sea creatures. My son and I shared the Caesar salad which was quite good. Was that a touch if mustard in the dressing? YUM! For our entrees my two dining companions had the \"Pasta Trio\". Both enjoyed them, although they felt they were inconsistent.... and not refilled as \"enthusiastically\" as hoped for. My grilled salmon was tasty, but a little fatty. I never had fatty salmon before. Kinda weird. The accompanying Yukon gold potatoes and green beans with a whole grain mustard sauce were DELISH!   Desserts were quite good. A pumpkin mousse and an amaretto cake shared three ways were a tasty ending to the meal.",

Although a menu was requested to choose a dinner item to replace the duck pasta, the waitress never came by to take the order, so no dinner.  The chicken on the tasting menu was so spicy as to be inedible.  One person in our party ordered salad and pasta, two people had the tasting menu. The salad was delivered at the same time as the tasting menu appetizers, but the (awful) duck ragu pasta was not delivered with the tasting menu pasta. The waitress did not check to see when we wanted the duck pasta and waited to deliver the duck pasta until the tasting menu pasta was completely consumed and the tasting menu entrees were delivered. So - one hungry person watches other people slowly eat their pasta - they assumed the a la carte pasta dish would be delivered with their pasta - or at least be asked when the pasta entree was wanted.  A dessert menu for the now dinner-less person was delivered, but the dessert order was never taken by the waitress, so the dinner-less person watched the tasting menu eaters eat dessert.   We will never, ever return.",

    "text": "Easter brunch - Our Lidia's \"tradition\" will end today for multiple reasons leading to an awful overall customer experience.   My 85 year old mother visits Pittsburgh for Christmas and Easter. We have made a point to close out her trip with a brunch for the last 3 years. My wife and I took my mom and my two daughters today, hoping to have a nice brunch to close out the holiday.  First - the menu.  The regular Sunday brunch is $30 per person.  There is a special Easter menu.  Price is increased to $45 and quality and quantity of the food was average at best and limited.  Next - the service.  Our waiter started the drink order with my 85 year old mom's wine then I ordered a beer, my wife needed more time to select her wine, our daughters ordered a bloody Mary and a beer.-- they were carded - one is 23 and the other is 24.   For some reason the waiter decided to card my 43 year old wife -  she forgot her ID in her other purse.  He refused to serve her -- although her daughters were of age. - go figure - no common sense.- no customer service.  He served me, her husband without requesting ID.  Yes, it may be flattering to get carded, but really - no common sense  Next - the management -  we asked to speak to tHe manager - remember this is a 1145am Easter Sunday reservation for 5 adults having a $45 lunch and $9 drinks - it's not the Southside at 1AM.   He came to the table. He first grilled us with a few pointless questions. He then responded with \"he would think about whether she was allowed to order a wine\".  Not sure what he was thinking about- he was no older than our daughters - my wife is probably his moms age. After a delay - he came back and said \"we would be happy to serve a glass of wine, if there is not a scene\"   We were all very confused by that statement.  It was clear he was not happy to service anyone.  It was clear he does not understand the definition of customer service  Finally - the $45 grilled cheese -  my daughter had early dinner plans so wanted to eat lighter.  The only smaller portion was the children's menu grilled cheese that was $16 per the menu -  the bill came - $45 was the charge.  I didn't look at the bill until I got home or there would have been a scene Now for anyone questioning if we do not understand customer service.  our family group owns a  restaurant in the south hills - we understand the meaning and importance quality service.  The same group of 5 of us went to Lucca's Ristorante the previous night and that was a 5 star service from the GM introducing the staff to every attention to detail of our server Chris  For those questioning this review based on the inference that the meal was overpriced and we were overcharged-  I had no problem with the $300 bill on Saturday.- food was good- service great.  I do struggle with the $300 tab for Sunday - as I said food was average at best and \"service\" ruined the experience  Bottom line - we dine out multiple times a week  there are very few places I would ever tell colleagues to avoid - however Lidia's will be one",

    "text": "AN OPEN AND PERSONAL LETTER TO LIDIA BASTIANICH ...  Lidia, we've dined at 7 or 8 of your restaurants, and love your food and have loved each dining experience. We've met you personally (you were very kind and gracious).    We've spent thousands of dollars at Falidia (Hassan is awesome), and lots more at other Lidia restaurants. My wife is grateful because you literally taught her to cook Italian through your PBS show. I'm Italian, and grateful to you for many wonderful meals in your restaurants, and grateful because my wife is a wonderful cook of Italian food (thanks to you).  We're HUGE fans of you and all of your restaurants - except for Lidia's Pittsburgh.  With this as background - our Friday 9/8/17 lunch meal at Lidia's Pittsburgh was INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING. If you'd been dining with us, you would have fired the general manager and the chef - on the spot - there is no doubt in my mind.  1st impression - \"wow, this place is EMPTY for 12:30pm on a Friday.\"   Read on - you'll understand why...   2nd impression - \"wow, this men's room smells awful. Whoever mopped this bathroom is a complete idiot that just doesn't care, because they used an old, sour mophead and now the floor smells awful. Awful. I guess the General Manager doesn't care, either, because having a bathroom smell this bad is just plain lazy and means either no one is checking the bathrooms - or no one cares - probably both.\"  We were seated. Servers were prompt and friendly. I ordered the Chef's choice Pasta Trio served tableside. My wife and our friend ordered from the menu.  3rd impression - \"friendly servers, but that's because the restaurant is mostly empty.\"  4th impression - \"the pastas in the pans they're bringing to serve my Trio tableside have been sitting in those pans for quite a while. I'm paying $17 for lunch - in Pittsburgh - but the kitchen doesn't care enough to send out fresh food. The pastas look like they were cooked at the start of lunch service, more than 90 minutes ago ...\"  5th impression - \"wow, this bowtie pasta with garlic and olive oil is utterly tasteless. What a cowardly \"Chef's choice\" - tasteless boxed bowtie pasta, oil and garlic?!? No seasoning? No salt? Our 8 year old could cook this. This isn't what I expect from pasta at a Lidia restaurant. The chef is either cheap, lazy, or both. This is too tasteless to eat.\"  6th impression - \"wow, the shrimp in this squid ink pasta and shrimp dish should have been thrown away 2 days ago. The whole dish tastes like old fish. And the squid ink pasta is utterly tasteless. Is this a leftover from yesterday?!? Chef - shame on you - again, lazy and cheap. This is too fishy to eat.\"  7th impression - \"OK, the meat filling in the ravioli tastes good. I can eat this. Too bad it was cooked long ago and the ravioli's pasta sidewalls are breaking down and gummy and sticking together because it's been reheated so many times. At least the meat filling tastes pretty good. We drove 3 hours for this meal, and I'm hungry, and I'm paying $17 + tax + tip for lunch, and the other 2 pastas on Chef's Trio today aren't worth eating, so I guess I'll eat this.\"  So I ate the meat ravioli and asked for seconds (just of the ravioli).  My first serving had been sitting there too long, but at least it had a nice taste. I'm still hungry, because I refused to eat the other 2 pastas.  8th and final impression - \"Are you kidding me?!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME...?!? You're bringing me the same damn ravioli that was in the pan 20 minutes ago - and was gummy and overly reheated then - but now the sauce is very watery because some lazy bastard in the kitchen poured hot water all over it?!?  OMG, I wish Lidia was sitting here in disguise - an episode of Undercover Boss - she would go berserk - THIS IS REDICULOUS!  Lidia would be so furious!   But I ate it anyway because I was still hungry and paying too much for this crap. $17 isn't an expensive lunch in Manhattan, but it's pricey in Pittsburgh or Kansas City (yes, we've dined there, too, Lidia).  Lidia - fire the chef. Fire the general manager. Do it immediately. They just don't care. Their operation of this restaurant is damaging your good name, and damaging the brand you and your team have worked very hard for decades to build.  Read the other reviews - this wasn't an isolated incident. You should be embarrassed. I'd be embarrassed. Actually I'd just be damn mad. My firey Italian would come out. There's no excuse for this other than laziness and being cheap and trying to fix an underperforming restaurant on the backs of your customers.  If this restaurant isn't a commercial success, then close it down. But if you're going to keep your name on the restaurant, at least get a team running it that cares about producing food of the quality we expect from you, and you expect from them.  Until then, personally, I'd get a can of spray paint and cover over your name on the side of the building...  This was astoundingly disappointing, and wasn't an isolated incident.",

I wish we would have known to ask for the table by the fireplace as it looked quite cozy.. The decor is rather trendy, great selection of Italian red wines and a promising cocktail selection. I ordered the Italian Greyhound and was surprised how strong the drink was, my husband had the Black Maple which was more balanced and quite delicious.  The bread bowl with basil pesto oil and garbanzo beans with olives was the perfect start but it sort of fell off after that.. I might have overdone it on the bread as I don't feel I ate much of my dinner. I ordered the Italian trio which is 2 homemade and one imported pasta served tableside. My ravioli was great but the other two pastas were a bit overdone and the sauces we're rather bland. I loved the concept of the unlimited pasta but the flavors fell a bit flat for me.

So we ordered salads, a bottle of wine and dinner... over an hour and a half goes by and we were delivered our salads, bottle of wine and that's it... our waitress checked on us one time, we sat there waiting for our food for over 2 hours and nothing came out to us. Extremely disappointing. We left the restaurant, and also seated next to a group for Ladies also waiting on their dishes whom arrived shortly after we did, with little interaction. Extremely disappointing in the service as we had heard decent reviews and we were out celebrating.... we left without paying flr our wine or anything else but called to speak to a manager who had said out right how embarrassed he was and said he would have also left if experienced the same type of service. Just hope in the future this can be fixed and this situation won't happen again.",

    "text": "This is a place that you really want to like. I like the interior, and the location right next to the Homewood Suites is ideal for me when I am traveling. I have been in about three times over the last 4 months.   The thing is, it is just OK. If it were not the closest restaurant to my hotel and not one of the many BYOB restaurants, I would never go back.   The good - the caesar salad is delicious. This is the one thing I make sure to order each time because I can count on it. I've tried the Ziti, which was overcooked with a sauce that was bland. The meatballs, however were very good. The short ribs - I got them twice. The first time I was disappointed as they were not tender, but had promising flavor. I decided to try them again a month later to see if they were more tender. Nope, they were not. This is a meat that should fall apart. Sadly, at Lidia's, it does not.   And I know this is a picky thing, but while I don't necessarily use a lot of salt, I find the food here needs it as it is rarely seasoned properly. You would not think this a big thing. But as is the custom in some restaurants, they don't keep salt and pepper on the table, I guess because the Chef feels like he is doing a bang-up job in the kitchen with the seasonings. He is not, and I need it. But getting it is somewhat of a process. You need to locate your server, ask for it, then they come back with this small bowl with a spoon. Lovely, and I know an appropriate presentation to many. But the whole process just takes too long and by the time they are back with your salt, your food is usually cold.",

Service was very friendly & attentive despite the fact that the place was packed.   The bread basket was delicious...parmesan breadsticks & rosemary focaccia with two different dips/spreads: a kalamata olive/cannellini bean & a pesto/garbanzo bean. They sat in a drizzle of olive oil & were really yummy, almost like Italian hummus.   Had the chef's pasta sampler, which included homemade fettuccine with pepperoncini & San Marzano sauce, homemade ravioli stuffed with pears in a parmesan/black peppercorn sauce & a baked ziti with sausage & cabbage. The fettucine was amazing, the pasta was super tender & the sauce robustly flavorful. The ravioli was not a combination I'd have ordered off the menu because it sounded so strange, but I changed my mind after the first bite. The sweetness of the pears was countered by the saltiness of the cheese & the peppercorns added nice texture. The ziti wasn't remarkable & the portion I was given was kinda dry & not very warm. Since they serve the pasta tableside from a big pan, I imagine keeping the ideal temperature is a challenge.  Wine list was good & the pour was adequate. Prices overall were a bit high, but that's to be expected at a place that's tied to a \"celebrity chef.\"",

Not only did we not have many choices, the food (had we ordered off the menu, would have been no more than $40 tops).  The wine selection is so so.  It just seems like for a business function they tried to rake massive amounts of profits without actually offering anything good.  The appetizers were horrendous, sorry ... we had some kind of fried shrimp, and the shrimp was undercooked (each one of them) so that each one is translucent instead of white when you bite into it ... and so so so greasy, like you went to a $10 diner not a $100 per person high end place.  The asparagus that accompanied the meal was so overcooked that they went limp and wilted, greasy (again! for asparagus!) ... it could've been steamed for 5 minutes without any other cooking and tasted about 10 times better.  I am sorry, but this feels so over-priced and over-rated.  It has not be the most over-paid and under-enjoyed meal I ever had for business function.  This is my third visit and first one in a business function - the two prior times were fine, not great; but this third time was disastrous.",

We found a spot in a paid parking lot across the street.  For $6 we were able to park about a quarter mile away.  I need the exercise anyway.    Our waitress was very helpful and attentive.  I was interested in trying Lidia's bolognese sauce.  Even though it was not on the menu, they served a small plate of spaghetti with bolognese sauce.  Big points for accommodating my request.  But the sauce was watery without much flavor.  I was impressed with the knife skills of whoever fine diced the carrots.  Just surprised/disappointed with the results.  There are probably as many different bolognese recipes as Italian cooks.  This may have been perfectly prepared but I was expecting more depth of flavor in a carefully built, slow simmered sauce.    As others have mentioned, the bread service is great.  The scoops of basil  and olive flavored spread were a little bland.  When combined with the fresh bread with salt crystals on the crust, the result was really good.   I had the white bean soup of the day.  It was a bit bland needing a little more salt.   Same opinion of the gnocchi with braised duck ragu.  The ragu sauce had much more flavor than the soup and was enjoyable but could have been better with a touch more salt.    As a classically trained newbe cook, I try to eat the best of the best foods when I can.  It is easy to follow a recipe.  It is very hard to prepare a dish perfectly.  I was hoping for perfection.  Don't think that is what I got - but really enjoyed the bread and great service.",

The only thing taking away from it was the execution on the pasta itself. The fettuccine was cooked well past al dente and bordered on soggy.  The ravioli however were perfect And the flavor profiles on all the dishes were spot on  The reason I gave a five star review on 3 to 4 star food was the service.

I had a salad with a red wine vinegar&EVOO dressing on request. Someone in kitchen in charge of salads don't know how to make a proper easy dressing! I am a retired Sous Chef 10 yrs retired at a resort hotel in Miami beach. So I was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad! Yes dirty! The endive had the bottom cores on them and wasn't washed properly. The veggies tomatoes were gross and the dressing was mixed oil vinegar only no herbs! I pushed it away ugh! Then I had the gnocchi my Mom used to make from scratch ! This wasn't that! This was the frozen gnocchi I in supermarkets they were all the same size and the taste was that you find in a store not fresh made! Don't be fooled! It came w duck ragu that was ice cold! They must of forgot to heat it up. Desert time! Well I was still very hungry order coffee and Tiramisu was a old soggy mess! Last piece in fridge seemed like. I hate Olive garden but Lidia's made that good! Next time want Italian& nice prices go to Alexander's in Bloomfield all their pastas made to order in kitchen it says on their menu may take  10 extra minutes to prepare since they make them to order! Try their Calamari over Angel hair yum! Until Lidia's comes here and inspects & teaches that staff how to cook her recipes they are not what she makes on tv! I made her recipes and they were really great this was simply Gross& high priced too!& I went by Access so didn't have to pay $7.00 valet parking fee!",

For a flat rate of $28 you get an alcoholic drink, appetizer buffet, entree and dessert buffet. I recommend the Sangria although if you like Blood Mary's they look tasty and the option of a mimosa is always there.  The buffet consists of a variety of salads and other delicious Italian dishes.  This past time they had roasted squash and cauliflower, an antipasto tray, quiche and a few other dishes I just didn't have room to try. It is always fresh and the servers are quick to replenish.  Next up you get to pick an entree which also includes the pasta trio tasting. I recommend this as you get to sample 3 different types of pasta dishes and then have unlimited refills of your favorite one.  Servers bring out the pasta in the hot pans right to your table. Save room for dessert which is another buffet with their fabulous tiramisu and a variety of other Italian treats including some types of Italian cookies.  I don't really like tiramisu but at Lydia's it is fabulous! Our server was fantastic-every time we left the table which was a lot (to get more food of course) she folded our napkin!  She overheard it was my birthday and made sure to bring out a dessert with a birthday candle.  The atmosphere is so comfortable and with lots of room.

    "text": "My wife and my experience at Lidia's Saturday evening was not positive.  We ordered the unlimited pasta tasting trio; two of the three dishes were mediocre, the third (Bolognese) was very good.  Our major disappointment however was in the service and it appeared to us that the issue stemmed from a systematic management failure of server coordination and/or training. We were offered complimentary bread but after 10 minutes needed to ask for it to be delivered to our table. We then encountered intolerable wait time for second servings of the pasta trio, despite speaking to our server twice about it. He said he was trying to \"run down\" the pasta servers but it appears he was none to successful at that task.  The choice I asked for took over 20 minutes to be delivered and by that  time, with my wife's pasta second sitting cold on her plate, we decided to simply order our desert and depart.  The deserts were okay, nothing special. We left the restaurant after about two hours, most of the time spent waiting for service.  With multiple great restaurants in Pittsburgh, we are not likely to return to Lidia's.",

    "text": "Last week my husband and I visited Pittsburgh for a rock concert.  We stayed at the fantastic hotel next door to Lidia's, and decided to have dinner there.  It was a very disappointing meal.  I ordered the Pasta Trio, and my husband ordered the Risotto.  The Risotto arrived and we both tasted it - they must have used low sodium stock...this dish had absolutely no flavor at all.  There were no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables.  My first two pasta samples arrived.  One was a very very good ravioli with some type of sage filling.  The other was fusilli in a red sauce that  was ordinary to the extreme.  When our waitress checked in, nearly a half hour later, we informed her that I'd never received the third pasta, and my husband's dish was unsalted and bland.  She left and about 10 minutes later, I received my third pasta, a wide noodle with a chicken reduction sauce.  Not exciting.  For $33 I expected more.  It was pasta, after all, one small serving of each.  I had dessert, which was 3 flavors of gelato.  The flavors were good enough, but not the same as the menu.  All in all, for the money paid, and time spent (over an hour and a half) this restaurant did not merit more than 2 stars.  A shame, since the menu was interesting and the restaurant itself roomy and nicely decorated.  There seemed to be plenty of waitstaff - but somehow our waitress was either running all over the place or had disappeared for long lengths of time.  This place needs some help.",

    "text": "I didn't really know what to expect from Lidia's, but in all it was the perfect meal for us travelers.   The experience started off a little rocky, but at every progression of the meal, the experience got better and better.   . The Strip was a ghost town on a Saturday night (during the Kenny Chesney concert). Upon opening the doors to Lidia's, the interior was bustling... with old people! While the decor seemed modern and edgy, the clientele was decked out in rinestone-encrusted tshirts and argyle. Yikes!  We kept changing our reservation number throughout the day, and by the time we arrived, our party was officially a party of four instead of six. I'm not unsympathetic to needing to do some table switching to accommodate us, but it appeared as if the hostess meant to solve the problem and then forgot about us once another problem arose. After a fairly long wait off to the side, one of our party went to the podium to ask about our table. Apparently, they had forgotten about us, but we were seated quickly after the mistake was realized. (Sidenote: the hostess' outfit was really unintentionally inappropriate. Part of her top was sheer, and would have been tastefully so if she didn't have her bra and underwear sticking out in awkward places, unbeknownst to her.)  Anyway! I guess I can see how people think Lidia's is too much like an Olive Garden, but once you look at the ingredients and the preparation methods, it really isn't at all. I guess people see \"unlimited pasta\" and their minds go somewhere a little less sophisticated. Don't fall into this trap! Everything was expertly prepared with balanced flavors and appropriate portioning.   I had the pasta trio (like everyone else, amirite!?) and indeed, the beginning portions of the pasta were small. The point is to sample, and then get more of what you prefer, even if it's all of them. I wouldn't want huge globs of pasta on my plate (getting cold, cheese and sauces congealing), so I appreciated this approach. Your followup portions come by with waiters carrying large metal pans of small-batch prepped pasta. All of the pasta tasted freshly made (not dried) and with exceptionally light and  balanced sauces. Perfect.  I feel like you have to get the pasta trio at least once. The other entrees looked amazing as well. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would focus my ordering on the rotating seasonal entrees.   My Cesar salad was a little overdressed for my tastes, but still very flavorful and fresh. The bread basket was above-average, with at least three different warm options and two spreads (an olive and pesto spread).   Dessert was inventive, a lemon cake with a basil layer and poppyseed ice cream. The other elements escape me, but it was nice that my table mate gave me a bite.   Service was great, if a little slow towards the end. I enjoyed their wine selections, though one of the reds was much better alone (not with food), and probably  shouldn't have been on the menu. Though the wine list is quite extensive, there's a smaller, curated list of bottles for $28. It kept our choices (and bill) a little more manageable. So glad I got to try Lidia's!",

    "text": "My husband and I opted to go to Lidias for restaurant week since he had never been before. I've been there for brunch in the past and had good meals, so I thought it'd be a nice place to take my Italian hubby. We both selected the prix fix menu with wine pairings. ($35 + $22).   It was apparent when we sat down that they were understaffed. The hostess began taking our drink order because our waitress was busy. When the waitress finally got to our table, we told her that we wanted to do the wine pairing and she offered us a few tasting options. They had a decent wine selection, and both her recommendations were delicious.  We both started our meals with caesar salads. The salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance. They were over-dressed and way too big for a starter salad, and the croutons were soggy as if they had been sitting in the dressing for a while. At this point, we hadn't seen our waitress in a long time; maybe 15 minutes had gone by and we were nearly done with our salads before the wines came.  For the main course, I selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage. The sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful. The gnocchi, however, was so burnt it was like eating dehydrated, crunchy noodles with a dense chewy inside. Very unappetizing and I was unable to continue eating.  My husband had the pasta trio, which is a table-side serving of three different pastas. The first was a spiral noodle in red tomato sauce, which was good. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce wasn't too sweet. The second pasta was gnocchi in a sage cream sauce, also good. The third pasta was supposed to be linguine in a mushroom sauce, but the noodles were extremely under-cooked, some of them still clumped together at one end, and there wasn't any sauce in the pan. Even the server commented on the lack of a sauce. It was inedible..  Again, our waitress was gone for a long time and one of the nearby servers noticed that we weren't eating our meals and we were actively searching for our waitress. He came over to our table and we explained the situation. He was really nice and immediately went to find the manager to get it fixed. In the meantime, our waitress did stop by and we explained again to her. She also went to find the manager. The manager came over to our table almost immediately. She was very kind and apologetic, indicating they were having a very bad day in the kitchen. She offered us new plates of food, but at this point we weren't very hungry and still hadn't eaten dessert. The manager offered to pay for our meals and dessert. I had a Nutella tart and my husband had tiramisu, both yummy, but too large to finish.  Before leaving, our waitress told us we should come back, especially after they had plans to remodel in the near future. Not sure that we will after this experience...",

I like Pittsburgh overall. People here are really nice. Caesar salad, bread, Tiramisu dessert were good.   The pasta trio entree, the cocktail, the red wine were awful. Mushy fettuccine in danky yucky sauce - tasted unfresh. Spaghetti pasta perfect al dente - but sauce was awful - tasted dank rank old and reprocessed. Like leftovers. Very gross. The red wine tasted like vinegar. Just awful. The cocktail tasted bitter - ?fresh squeezed orange juice? more like orange rind into the juice. Ruined the cocktail. Could not drink it.   I gave feedback to the waiters - they provided excuses for the poorly prepared items. Sounds like they chalked it up to me not knowing what good food is. Ha Ha.   Just know - It is expensive here - and I had one of the more moderately priced entrees. The people at Lidias are very nice, but there are places in Pittsburgh where you get good tasting food and the lovely Pittsburgh hospitality at a better price. I've checked with locals - they won't recommend Lidias but will recommend some other Italian places in the city.",

    "text": "TL;DR : Who's it for?: Hungry pasta lovers, people in the area looking for a slightly upscale, Italian meal. Service: 9/10 (wait 'till you see the number of service staff) Food: 7/10 (I'd usually rate this closer to 6) Value: 8/10 if you eat a good bit and do the tasting trio, 6/10 otherwise Decor/Environment: Slightly upscale Recommend or not?: Recommend if you are in a group of pasta lovers, otherwise no.  Full Review: Lidia's is a slightly upscale Italian restaurant located on Smallman Street.  For those who are regulars, the \"signature\" item on the menu is \"Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio\", an \"as much as you can eat\" of three different kinds of pasta that are updated daily.  This is definitely the highlight for me as well since the rest of the menu, while not bad, don't seem to be a good value for me  Service 9/10: This, to me, is Lidia's best point as of this review.  While slightly odd, Lidia's boasts a RIDICULOUS number of service staff.  The record of different faces I've seen who have waited on my table was six with the latest visit numbering five.  Usually, this results with your table being waited on promptly and not being left in the cold during your meal.    As for the servers themselves, historically (and for the most recent visit), they are absolutely solid.  While you may see some referring to some notes when they read off certain specials or the daily trio, I've yet to encounter someone that had no idea what they were doing.  In addition, they have almost always been friendly and attentive to their work as it is needed.  Everett was the stand out person during service for me today.  He was busing and was full of energy with a happy attitude.  Honestly, this really made a huge difference this visit that I even felt it warranted something extra to really give him a big thumbs up but he was exceptional (the other service staff on this visit were great too)!  Food 7/10: This is the real shame for me.  The food itself is not that great.  It's alright and every now and again you'll have a gem within the pasta trio while other times it just ends up being a mess on your plate of (sometimes) watery pasta.  While I will acknowledge that the independent entrees (AKA, not trio) are better in quality, this is not exactly an amazing experience for any diner.  I particularly avoid the salad and desserts as they've never really amazed me (the tiramisu came the closest but   The one thing that I find always to be a plus (while I passed on it this time because it didn't quite make sense since i was alone to review the place) is the bread offering.  It is awesome with different kinds of bread with two types of spread (one salmon based and the other bean if I recall).  If you're in a group, you will survive the wait to the main course.  To me, if I had to point at one thing that ends up being underwhelming, is perhaps the seasoning and general food prep.  The trio can be particularly hit hard on this point because they're constantly cooking up more but the quality fluctuates wildly to the point where I actually made it a point to visit today right at the start of dinner service to see if there was a difference on the first prep and it was amazing at how the quality went on a roller coaster ride.  Maybe it's a lack of excitement for the menu or just a general complacency but the food really can't be counted on to be the best in flavor.  Value (8/10 if a big eater of pasta, 6/10 otherwise): This comes down to the price versus quality.  It just doesn't make sense to me if you come here for anything besides the trio for your dollar.  The food just isn't up to par to other comparable competitors.  Even with the trio, it can be kinda hit and miss depending upon what food is available that day (for me, my cardinal rule is to look out for mushrooms in their lineup or weekend service).  So if you just want to scarf down pasta, you'll probably get a decent bang for the buck.  Otherwise, you're out of luck.   Decor/Environment: As per usual, I don't give a score for this since people have different tastes.  It passes the cleanliness check and avoids anything that would really ruin a dining experience in my opinion.  Bathrooms are well kept (from my experience anyways) and tables aren't squished together.  It is a little towards upscale but you'll see plenty of people in casual wear dining here (often people heading to a ballgame or having stopped by the history center or something pop up).  Final thoughts: I really wish I could recommend this place as an all around good place to dine but it really isn't UNLESS you eat a lot of pasta.    Tip for reading to the end: Call ahead to get the trio listing for the day and see if it matches with what you'd want to eat and go in a group.  I would even see if you can get seated at the start of service if you don't mind the dining area being a little more sparse just because your service level will probably be better.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Homewood next door to Lidia's and decided to try it out on a rainy Monday evening after the holidays. Interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. Very unique chandeliers and posh looking. Our review may be impacted by the fact that we had a long day of travelling and had many snacks so we were not ravenous upon arrival. For that reason, we did not order any appetizers.   The bread basket was fairly good and the dipping sauces (pesto, oil, and a white bean dip) were good. The bread sticks especially had a great cheese flavor. One thing that struck me about this establishment was the amount of staff that they had. Two people (perhaps one was shadowing the other as a new hire?) to deliver the bread, a waitress, and another person who delivered our dinner. All were attentive and friendly. If this review was strictly for service it would be 5 stars.  I shared the chicken parm with my daughter. It was lackluster to say the least. I do not recall what the menu stated, but as served this was a piece of essentially fried chicken, with some chunks of tomato and bland unseasoned broccoli served on the side. No pasta. No melted cheese on top of the chicken.   DH ordered the heritage pork with a side of brussels sprouts with pancetta. He reported that the pork was fair to middling but the brussel's were the real star of the show. I did try one and would have to agree. If we ever came back here we would probably just order several plates of brussels, but the likelihood of our returning here is pretty small.  We did see another table with the fresh pasta (final prep done tableside) and that did look delicious.",

We also had calamari (unique because the pieces are thinner than usual) and fried cheese.  The trio of pastas that evening was a pappardelle with olio, butternut squash and caramelized onion (ok but too much garlic); a Classic bolognese with Rigatoni  (good); and lastly a Goat cheese ravioli in thyme butter that I could not stop eating. I had thirds on that one it was so tasty. The ravioli were big so the cheese flavor came through. The beauty of a trio of pastas- there always will be one that is amazing and outshines the rest. For dessert I had the pumpkin spice custard and loved it. You would need to be a pumpkin fan to appreciate this desert. It was served in a sauce and with a piece of pumpkin seed toffee brittle on top- loved the mixed texture going on there.",

    "text": "My husband watches Lidia every Saturday on Create.  We make a weekend trip to Pa, and were both excited to visit this restaurant.  Per other reviews, we chose to go to Sunday brunch.  This was an excellent choice. You're offered complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary.  You then have an antipasti buffet which has a staff member who stands there making sure everything is kept fresh, and to answer any questions.  He also took our soup to our table to allow us to continue getting items from the buffet.  You have about 16 choices on the buffet, not including soup, meats. We both chose to have the pasta trio - where you are initially given 3 small portions of the daily special pasta, with ordering more as needed. The desserts are phenomenal.  You have cookies, fruit, tiramisu, cakes. If my husband wasn't as full as he was, I would have had him roll me out the door ;-)",

    "text": "3.5 stars We stumbled upon Lidias after a full meal. My fiances mom is really into Lisia so we decided to check it out for dessert.   Upon entrance we realized we were probably underdressed for the occasion, everyone seemed to be slightly more well dressed. We were seated for dessert with minimal wait time.  Since we were already full from dinner we opted for dessert and coffee only. We definitely weren't disappointed with the dessert. We ordered the tiramisu and the nutella custard, both of which was rich and delightful. To drink, I had a decaf cappuccino with the in house coffee bean they offered and my fiance had a double should of espresso which GIANT. It was practically a cup of really concentrated coffee. He was definitely awake after that! Anyways, we definitely enjoyed the taste of the beans, it had a unique toasty flavour.   So, the reason I'm bumping this place down to a 3.5 instead of a 4 was because the service was not the greatest. The server we had at our table was very nice, but after she realized we were only ordering dessert, we felt her attitude changed slightly as she became less attentive. And near the end of our meal she shoved us the bill prior to us asking. Of course that brought her tip down.  Later as we walked out we noticed that there was a collection of Lidias books on sale with her \"autograph\" in the front covers. Since my fiance's mother loves Lidia, we decided to buy one for her. Wrong decision!  Let's just say.... The process of getting this book took longer than our meal! And I was giving the wrong change which prolonged the entire fiasco.  So, overall good dessert, can't say much for the regular savoury food but the service was definitely odd and questionable.   Might try this place again for the savoury food.",

    "text": "Lidia, you let me down.  I'm a huge fan of Lidia Bastianich, love her books, love her recipes, love her shows, and love most of her restaurants. So when I had the opportunity to visit Pittsburgh recent was to make reservations at Lidia's Pittsburgh. Literally speaking, as soon as I finished booking my hotel I went to Open Table to make my reservation at Lidia's.  So, my daughter and I visited on a Saturday night in February. Our first impression was the $7 valet parking fee. What? I'm from New York City and I've never paid $7 for someone to park my car. No way could I support that, we drove a half a block further and found a nice spot on the street. I really didn't get the impression that this restaurant was so upscale that the $7 valet fee is warranted. First disappointment of the night.  The restaurant was not very busy this night so we had a very nice quiet dining experience. After having a chance to browse the menu our waitress described for us the Pasta Trio, a selection of three fresh pastas, two local, one imported, served with a variety of sauces. My family and I are huge fans of Lidia's restaurant in NYC named BECCO which also serves the Sinfonia di Paste, their version of the Pasta Trio.  The Pasta Trio is served tableside with unlimited portions of the three pasta choices of the night. For us these choices included Penne Ala Vodka, with imported penne, Fettuccini with scallions and carrots, and beef brisket ravioli in a butter sauce.  After reading several Yelp reviews about this place we got the impression our best experience would be from the Pasta Trio. So we tried it.  The Penne Ala Vodka was average; the sauce was similar in taste to what I've had from Lidia's jarred sauces. I would expect so much more from the in-person experience. The pasta itself was more than al dente; it was on the tough and chewy side. The fettuccini pasta was delicious, very thin and I liked the scallions and carrots sauce. There may have been more to the sauce but I don't recall at this point. The last of the pastas was the beef brisket ravioli, WOW, this was delicious! Love it! Ok, I don't normally get this excited about pasta but I loved this one, I want to make this one myself at home.   So to sum up the Pasta Trio, one hit (the brisket), one miss (the penne), and one eh? (the fettuccini). Having tasted so many of Lidia's dishes at this point I set the bar high for her restaurants. Lidia's Pittsburgh sadly didn't deliver up to these expectations.   The atmosphere is nice, warehouse decor with exposed trusses on the ceiling, the staff was friendly and very well informed about the menu, but the overall experience just comes up average. The flavors just were not there for us.",

McKenzie and Jurien were also attentive and helpful. The chandeliers were made out of stunning hand blown Italian glass bulbs.

    "text": "My hubby bought a groupon for this place, so we tried it tonight.  We were going to go with a group of friends, but they only allow 1 groupon per table.   Valet was $7 and they park your car right in front which is convenient.  Walking in, they had 2 hostesses who were very pleasant.  The decor is modern.  Our server was really nice and attentive.  I think his name is Chando?  I appreciate it too when the server offers to box leftovers instead of customers having to ask for boxes.  I guess I feel like I'm not imposing when they offer to do it.   As we were seated, he filled our water glasses and talked to us about the groupon, which included a bottle of wine from the $32 list (which is possibly their cheapest wine selection).  The selection here is pretty extensive.  I really enjoyed the bread basket with the garbanzo and cannelini bean hummus.  I think that's what they were.  My husband got the soup of the day which he said was just ok.  Nothing special.  My caesar salad was also the norm but there was so much of it, which was a waste.    I like the pasta tasting trio, which our server said varies daily depending on the chef's selection.  We had the paparrdele w/ sausage and cabbage, gemelli with spinach and ricotta and ramp, pea, asparagus ravioli.  All tasted pretty good.  My fave among the three waa the pappardele and my hubby liked the ravioli.  I did notice our server called the gemelli a fusilli but they do look pretty similar, and I didn't really mind bc either way, the dish would prob taste the same.  The servers came around with the food efficiently and I felt like I was at an all you can eat brazilian steakhouse only with the chip always on green side. No complains though because we were able to take our food to go.  We also ended up taking the tiramisu to go and actually haven't tasted it yet.  It looked good!  Price wise, if we didn't have a groupon, I think the bill would've been $104 plus two tiramisus, so the groupon was prob a 50% off deal.  Overall, I would recommend the food we had and the service.",

    "text": "Great experience at Lidia's, our first time trying this authentic Italian restaurant in the Strip District. This venue is near the convention center and plenty of hotels so it's a great spot if you're staying near this area of the city.  My girlfriend and I started with the 1400 Fizz, a bright, fizzy and fruity cocktail that was so good we both got seconds. For the antipasti (starter) we tried the Frico (Montasio Cheese Crisp, Shrimp and Scallions, Potato-Leek Filling). An absolute treat to start the dinner, the cheese crisp on the outside was perfectly done with crisped brown edges and a golden exterior, the shrimp inside is like a pleasant surprise when you bite into it, a brighter seafood taste cutting through the cheese and potato.   For the secondi (entree) I had the Anitra (Seared Duck Breast, Creamy Polenta, Grappa Soaked Cherry Sauce). A hearty and satisfying comfort food in taste, the duck here was some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The sear on the outside was great and the duck was cooked to a perfect medium. Perfect duck to fat ratio, just enough of a fat cap to add flavor and not too much to be off putting.   My girlfriend had the Scotaditto (Rosemary Marinated Lamb Chops, Eggplant Caponata, Balsamic Reduction). The lamb was superb, highly recommend getting this dish. The flavor packed a huge punch, and the lamb flavor was accentuated by beautiful grill marks on the chops.  To finish I couldn't pass up the Limoncello Tiramisu (limoncello soaked ladyfingers, lemon flavored mascarpone, candied lemon zest) and she had the Torta Rigojancsi (chocolate sponge cake, chocolate mousse, amarena cherries, zabaglione). My tiramisu was light and the candied lemon zest was my favorite part, nice little bursts of sugar and crispy lemon zest. Her torta was savoy and well balanced, not too heavy for being more dense than my selection. Personally I didn't love the amarena cherries as they were a bit bold for my taste but overall a great dessert.   Great experience all around! Great dinner!",

    "text": "SETTING: Nice environment that was able to cater to groups of all sizes, from small parties to even an ugly sweater party (this really happened!). Kind of dresses itself up to be a nice sit-down place, but unfortunately, the food was not on the same level.  FOOD: For appetizers, I shared the Calamari with my friend and for the main entree, I got the recommended Pasta Trio.   First off, I love calamari. A lot. I've definitely had better at similar quality establishments. The calamari was very bland and did not taste fresh. The batter was not crisp and crunchy. The sauce tasted watered down. The recommended \"Pasta Trio\" (3 types of pastas and \"all you can eat\") was a bit below average. For a recommendation, I expected more. Overall, the food was underwhelming.   My friend always cleans her plate. So clean, that it looks like she was served only the plate. This was the first time that she did not finish her dish (Chicken Cacciatore). She is not super picky, so this really meant she did not like it.  The type of food here is comparable to Olive Garden in terms of American-Italian fare, but I would rather eat at Olive Garden anyday. OG just tastes better and is way cheaper.  SERVICE: Mediocre at best. The waters were not kept filled. Not a huge deal for me since I drink slowly, but some of my friends kept looking for the water and it clearly distracted them from their dining experience. The Pasta Trio is \"all you can eat\" and they come back to refill your plate. A few of us were waiting on the third round...and we never got it. Even though the food was not the tastiest, we were hungry and still needed to be fed. The wait staff didn't even ask if we wanted a third serving, and just took our plates quickly without giving us a chance. A few of us were still left a little bit hungry...it was a grumpy ride home :(   IMPRESSIONS: Relative to the pricing of the food, I expected better quality. Even if the pricing was on par with comparable establishments, the quality of the food was lacking. I hate to say this, but we had a disappointing experience overall, from the food to the service.",

I wish I could say that I have tried a lot of things on the menu, but sadly, I enter the restaurant with the best of intentions and still end up ordering the pasta trio.  At times I do enjoy some of the pasta more so than another but the really wonderful thing about this is that you can always get more of what it is you like!  I love the idea that different  'sauces' are used on the pasta.  It makes it so much more special than just the ordinary 'tomato' sauce used normally.  My husband is a bit more adventurous than I am and does try other things on the menu.   Last weekend he ordered the calamari with greens and beans which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I am sorry to say that I can not remember which pasta I had last week - but I loved them all.   Maybe that is why I can't remember them!  The waiters have always been very attentive - walking around checking to see if anything else is needed (especially extra pasta!)  I am so happy that Chef Daniel is here is Pittsburgh!  I'm hoping to get back to Lidia's later this month on June 26th when Lidia herself will be there!",

The ambience is not kitschy-italian countryside at all. It's refreshingly simple in the decor and the service is amazing, because they give you just the right amount of attention, not too pushy or forgetful.  I don't remember the names, but I tried the Pork shoulder and lamp chops, and the Pasta Trio. The trio that day was garlic aiello with fresh fettucine, homemade sausage with tomato sauce and orecchiette, and mushroom ravioli. I love how they come with the hot pan of pasta and serve it on your never-ending plate. What I don't love was the undercooked orecchiette. The second batch was a little more cooked, and then it was delicious. Everything was very salty for my taste, but overall it was some of the best italian food I've had.    The best part of the experience was that I could hang out with good people and eat good food and Lidia was actually in the restaurant that night! She might not've made anything I ate, but a picture with her and hearing her talk to me made my night!",

    "text": "I popped into Lidia's for lunch before going to the Heinz History Center and Museum, which is right down the street. I'm not from the area and read some good reviews about this restaurant, so I wanted to try it. It was a Saturday around noon so I was expecting a huge crowd, but there were hardly any diners in the restaurant and after having my very expensive meal, it became apparent why. First, there was a prefix brunch menu which I found to be pricey (for the quality). There was a salad bar with old, wilted, over-dressed salad, a few different (old looking) pasta salads, and a sparsely covered meat board. For my entree, I tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter. It was a generous portion, but tasted just like a freezer lasagna you would purchase at the local grocery. The dessert bar was the best part. The nutella chocolate cake and lemon cakes were delicious. The tiramisu was not very good, though, It was runny, watery, and had too much brandy in it. The service was strange. My server was a little absent minded and awkward when presenting the menu. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, but it wasn't the worst dining experience I've ever had.",

We had to stop another waiter to ask for more water...I was never offered a refill on my diet coke (which sat empty for over 30 minutes).  The salmon was very good, but drenched in so much olive oil and garlic that an oil slick was left on the plate at the end of the meal.  The pasta tasting was....kind of weird.  One of the selections tasted like feet, the other tasted like something I could make at home with a bottle of Prego.  The best was a mushroom ravioli in olive oil -- but there was so much oil (see a theme?) I had to scrape it off before eating.  Long story short, we passed on dessert.   The food was adequate, the service was sub-par, and it was just kind of a \"meh\" experience.  I won't go back.",

    "text": "Was visiting Pittsburgh a few weeks ago and happened upon Lidia's mostly by accident.  A happy accident, for sure.  Lidia's has a nice selection of various pastas but their main attraction appears to be the Pasta Trio, where each day three different types of pastas are selected, each type having a waiter/waitress assigned to walking around and making sure you've got as much of it as you like, sort of the same thing gauchos do in Brazilian steakhouses.  My friends got the Trio and were quite happy with it.  I went safe with the lasagna, which was perfectly cheesy and saucy.  Dessert had a name I can't remember, but it was a kind of chocolate/caramel ice cream with a toasted marshmellow coating around it and little bits of toffee.  I shouldn't have eaten it all but my arm and my mouth conspired against me.  Jerks.  A nice ambiance and friendly waitstaff certainly don't hurt.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I think I'll be seeing Lidia again, and I don't care who knows!",

Our drinks were never empty and there was never a point where we were looking around trying to get our servers' attention. Now, on to the food. Brunch is $28 which includes coffee, a choice of a mimosa, sangria, or a bloody mary, antipasti table, entree, and dessert table. This is a great deal, with an overwhelming array of food options. My bloody mary was very good and spicy. I tasted the sangria and it was good as well. As each member of my brunch party went up to the antipasti table, an employee would come over and try to sell Lidia's books and pasta sauce. Who wants to be haggled while trying to grab a piece of salami? I don't understand why the management team thinks this is acceptable. I was completely turned off by this and it was annoying to everyone I was with. The antipasti table as good, but not great. The caesar salad was completely overdressed and the romaine was almost brown. Why would they use old lettuce? You can tell immediately just by looking at it that it isn't fresh. The entree I chose was the pasta trio and they were all fabulous. I had mushroom ravioli, ricotta with fettucine, and a penne bolognese. They were all so good I couldn't pick a favorite. I would come back, but if I was bothered at the antipasti table again I would ask to speak with management.",

    "text": "I grew up watching Lidia's TV show as a kid.  So of course when I found out she had a restaurant in Pittsburgh I just HAD to try it out.  The biggest selling point of Lidia's is probably their service.  People say ti's a good \"date spot\" mainly b/c of the atmosphere and service.  Their wait staff definitely has been trained to the attentive, but at times it can be overly done and I feel like I'm a part of a weeknight sitcom.  For appetizers, get their grilled octopus.  I've heard good things about their chicken livers, but I've never tried it myself.  Their fritto misto is prepared well, but not excessively special.  Their pasta tasting trio is always a great way if it's your first time at Lidia's; they always have two house-made pastas and one imported from Italy.  From my experience, I've always enjoyed their housemade varieties, especially their pappardelle and gnocci (when available).  Their ravioli's are typically pretty good too.  The imported pastas just don't seem to reach that perfect al dente \"bite\" fresh pastas can achieve.  Their ossobuco is a giant braised lamb shank that is fork tender and flavorful in a dark rich sauce.  It seems to be a popular dish, as the last time I was at Lidia's they were out of it.  On an ending note: Lidia's does take reservations (just visit their website or hop onto Opentable and rack up those dining points), but I've never had an issue getting a seat without reservations.",

But Still - Lidia's is one of the few restaurants on mine and Jordan's list, where one of us has been employed, but we will still willingly eat at.  Lidia's is our choice when we want great Italian foods that taste as close to our family making it as possible. The other night we went for drinks and apps at the bar.  This is always fun for us because the Fritto Misto is fried veggies and calamari in a light batter, with their sauce for dipping.  And Lidia is the queen of sauce recipes!  We also had the appetizer version of the pasta-tasting platter because there is no way to walk into that building and NOT get the pasta-tasting trio in some form or another.  It's just AMAZING! Our favorite time to go is for Saturday or Sunday Brunch.  I don't know why - but I think Lidia's Brunch is Pittsburgh's best kept brunch secret.  For $24.99 per person, you get a complimentary Bloody Mary or Mimosa to start, then you are brought your basket of scones, donuts, and breads accompanied by sweet butters.  Then you go up to the Anti-Pasta tables for veggies, egg frittatas, meats, salads, soups - its the ANTI-PASTA table!  Use your imagination (they use theirs!).  Then you order your Brunch Entree - whether that's the Pasta-Tasting trio or Filet & Eggs or Salmon.  After your Entree - you get to go up to their dessert table that always has tiramisu, Italian cookies, mousse, etc.  People give me their brunch suggestions all the time and NO ONE has beaten Lidia's.  Saturdays AND Sundays from 11a-2p.  Just prepare yourself for the food coma after!",

Tonight's (Mon, Oct 4) pasta trio was papardelle w/sausage and leeks, grilled peppers/eggplant and ricotta ravioli, and penne alla vodka.  The penne were cooked al dente just as I like it, but otherwise it was no different than most other penne alla vodka.  The ravioli were tasteful and obviously freshly made.  My favorite were the papardelle.  Very good!  Chendo, the bartender, is very friendly and makes a great mojito.",

A little loud, but if you are cool with that, it's all good.  However, my most recent visit dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4. The potato/lentil soup was bland. The pasta trio was really a pasta uno, because two of them weren't that great. Kind of a simple sundried tomato fettucini, not that good at all. Ravioli (which i was REALLY looking forward to) was mushy and over buttery. The only savior was the Rigatoni with sausage and peas.  I won't let one trip drop my opinion too far. I recommend that you go there and try it yourself, and try the pasta trio. It's different every day, so I probably just went on a not so great day, especially compared to my previous visits.",

Brunch also includes a nice mimosa or a bloody Mary.   We were not as impressed with the antipasti table. However, it was late in the day and perhaps that was part of the problem. The Cesar salad while yummy, looked a bit unhappy. And the wedding soup seemed bland. The quiche was good as well as the butternut squash casserole.   But things did looked up with our 2nd course choices. I had the Manicotti Ripieni di Ricotta. I loved the light tomato sauce and the pasta rolls. Big J had Sarme Caupcci-Ripieni, which has cabbage stuffed with pork, veal and beef.   Last was the dolci dessert buffet table. Having no room for dessert, we still shared a wonderful tiramisu.

Executive chefs that have come and gone, inconsistent food taste, porion sizes have shrunk yet prices kept going up, less and less crowds willing to pay top dollar for mediocre food and finally, wait for it, a health code violation that closes them for days.  And there you have it!  Recently stopped in for dinner with my wife. Not a good experience at all. Pasta sauce tasted burnt, apps were cold, dessert was blah and lacked creativity, in fact I would bet my paycheck it was Sysco purchased. Wine was good but severely overpriced. It was just a shame. The table next to ours was overheard to say problems with their service and food. So much they asked for their check and left. The table was still empty when we left. It is just a shame what has happened to this place over the years that used to be our favorite spot and always vibrant space. Perhaps it was time several,years ago or Lidia really doesn't know how or care to turn the place around. I guess you could say it's like WQED, old and past it's prime.",

    "text": "The best part of our visit to Lidia's was the service. Our waitress, Lorie, was amazing and attentive. For appetizers, we ordered an appetizer version of the pasta trio special and the charcuterie plate.  The charcuterie left a LOT to be desired, but the pasta appetizer was amazing and the highlight of the meal.  For dinner, we ordered the short ribs and the lamb chops.  The only real complaint here is that the short ribs seemed to be completely devoid of seasoning, which was odd since they are supposed to be braised in a horseradish sauce.  Also, the carrot and spinach Spatzle served with the short ribs had zero flavor and seemed pointless. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and the cookie plate. Both were amazing.   My primary complaint concerns the atmosphere.  For a fine dining experience, I generally expect a quiet, low-key atmosphere where you can actually hear your dinner companion speak.  That is not the case here. It is unclear why, but the atmosphere was extremely noisy and overwhelming.   We will eat here again as I am dying to try the pasta tasting trio for dinner, but hopefully the environment is a little more quiet.",

I made reservations a long time in advance, and we arrived early, even going to the salon to get ready for a fancy night out! Once we arrived at the restaurant, I was shocked at how many people were sitting on the floor out by the host stand, the valet stand, and by the toilets. They were so overbooked. When we told the hostess of our reservation, she said it would be at least at hour until they could seat us. My friend came straight from the airport to meet me at the salon, so she hadn't eaten all day. Unfortunately, we had to leave Lidia's and go to a restaurant that could better handle a Friday crowd. It was sad to see one of my old favorite restaurants get too big of an ego. Two stars for the great memories.",

Lidia's is certainly beautiful in design and provides a great setting for a special occasion. Very comfortable surroundings with the ability to conduct normal volume levels of conversation with one another.  No shouting necessary.  Menu and drink options were nice, but not attention grabbing.  They announced that they have a new tavern menu but no information was provided or posted.  Food quality and portions were below expectations. It was the first time I was not able to finish a salad at an Italian restaurant due to the displeasure of the house made vinaigrette dressing. I have had better bottled versions. Sauces lacked flavor.  Level of service did not match the cost of the meal.  Service was attentive but that was about it. Some servers seem to be more obsessed with clearing plates and glasses off the table rather than be more engaging with their dinner guests.  An example of this is taking a plate or drink away without first asking if they may do so.   I really don't want to completely give up on re-visiting Lidia's, but with so many other places yet to try, Lidia's finds themselves out of the top spot . I would, however, easily reconsider if Lidia herself was preparing the meal!  What a delight that would be!",

One of the pastas was nothing too fancy - a sausage and ziti with some basic sauce.  The shrimp fettuccine and short rib ravioli, however, were AMAZING.  I was bummed that the wine selection was so pricey, especially since the options were good (but not show stopping, so there's really no need to make a glass $14). The cocktail options seemed nice, so maybe I'll try that next time.",

Disappointing is probably the nicest way I could describe mine and my bf's dinner. To start, our waitress was delayed in getting water/bread to the table and we sat for probably a good couple of minutes, despite there not being a crowd of people in the restaurant. The only good thing we ordered was the steamed mussel appetizer. My bf had the pasta tasting trio for dinner and I chose the seafood pasta. The tasting trio was awkward because the servers came around at all different times, so my bf had 1 pasta for like 5 minutes and then the other 2 showed up after. Tasting trio included cheese ravioli, a shrimp/asparagus fettuccine, and a bolognese. There was barely any filling in the ravioli and the cheese tasted like melted Velveeta. The fettuccine was overwhelmingly overpowered by the asparagus and the \"sauce\" was watery. And the bolognese tasted burnt. There was no ask for \"seconds\" on that dinner. My seafood pasta was all clumped together when it arrived and there was absolutely no free sauce in the dish, like it had all been absorbed by the noodles or the shrimp. Frying on the shrimp was poor and soggy (maybe that's where the sauce went?). We both had about a couple bites each of dinner and that was good enough for us. I paid over $150.00 for an \"Italian\" dinner that was unappetizing. There are so many other authentic Italian restaurants we would choose over Lidia's ANY day. We tried it, and we will never be back.",

    "text": "I don't ever usually write reviews, but Easter brunch here was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years and a serious money making scam at $45 per person. The 3 course prix fixe menu began with \"family style\"  appetizers for the table to share. These were essentially: 1) a tiny dish of artichoke hearts that appeared as though they came directly from a Delallo's jar, 2) a couple arincini that I might buy from the Trader Joe's frozen appetizer section if I was forced into hosting some guests who I didn't really like very much 3) a couple crostini with a \"crab spread\" that looked so much as though it just came from a can that it was almost humorous and 4) a Ceasar salad that was \"just ok\", but we were willing to settle for that after the above options. I selected the gnocchi for my main course. It was much less appalling than the appetizer course but still extremely lackluster -- the duck ragu was watery , and the gnocchi were limp and mushy rather than pillow-like. My partner had the pasta trio. All three options were bland, and he was essentially served a plate full of butter upon asking for his first refill. I suppose that's one method of rationing your customers' \"unlimited pasta\" intake. I think the \"family style\" dessert course was an uninspired trio that included some conference-hotel-style mini squares of carrot and cheese cake, but by that point we were more eager to carry on with our day than we were hungry.",

It was the best meal on our table, but the mashed potatoes were dried out. I sent a review directly to the restaurant thru their website. I also wanted to know if I could just purchase the sarme to go. I never heard from them. The actual visit was very disappointing and the fact that they did not respond to my question was even worse. Perhaps Lidia needs to look a bit harder at her Pittsburgh location. I definitely will not be visiting them any time soon.",

As other people have said, don't you dare eat a single thing before you come here or you will have to be rolled out like Violet Beauregarde.  They start you off with a complimentary blood mary or mimosa.  Um, hai.  I like your style.  And you pick your entree (of course, the famous pasta trio is an option).  Then you get to take your fill of their antipasto spread.  A dozen different salad options, mussels, cheese, olives, frittata...  I had to try a bit of everything and yes, I was that person walking back to my table with two plates.  My entree was duck gnocchi.  I felt a little guilty because I adore duckies but damn was it tasty.  The gnocchi were like little pillows they were so light and fluffy.  Lidia, WHAT IS YOUR SECRET!?  Best gnocchi I have ever had (and I don't even really like it that much; something about it just called to me).  And then they wrap you up with a dessert table.  I was about read to pop and we had homemade ice cream and cake at home but I couldn't stop myself.  The little cookies were crisp and perfectly satisfying to wrap up a meal.  But I didn't stop there.  You're at Lidia's, you eat the tiramisu.  Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and perfect with a cup of coffee.  That coffee was so good, I didn't even need cream and sugar.  Slight downfalls: the waiter didn't know who was the birthday person (discreetly ask if you don't know, just don't plunk it down in front of someone) and the wait staff cleared away all serviceware before I was done.  I still had bread on my plate and I also needed a knife to cut through the baguette French-toast-like dessert - would have liked to enjoy it but I couldn't.  All in all, a great brunch.  Definitely the place to go for a special occasion.",

    "text": "What a huge disappointment. Bottom line: Horrid service, mediocre food.  There was no one at the hostess stand to greet us, and we waited several minutes. An unenthusiastic hostess finally seated us. The tables were set with tablecloth, silverware, and napkins only. No wine glasses or anything to make the table look pretty. There was a cheap amber candle, but it was not lit and no one ever lit it for us. The hostess laid our menus on the table and walked away.  Our server was nice but rushed. The place seemed understaffed even though there were lots of people rushing about. The server explained the menu and asked for drink orders. We were trying to decide if we wanted to order a bottle of wine, so we asked for a few minutes. A few minutes went by and the server was rushing around but never looked over at us to see if we were ready to order. We flagged him down and ordered a bottle of wine, and we placed our food orders at the same time. A few minutes later my salad and my date's appetizer arrived, but no wine. I was half way through my salad before the wine was presented - definitely not top quality service. My salad was small, unattractive, and drowning in dressing. There was absolutely no care or thought put into this salad. My date's bruschetta appetizer was bland.  My date ordered the special prix fixe dinner with three courses; I ordered the pasta sampler. They brought date's pasta course while I was sitting with an empty salad plate in front of me. No one came to take the salad or inquire if I would like to start my pasta course while my date had his. Date finished his pasta and his chicken entree was presented. I was presented with...an empty plate. It was a few more minutes before any of the pasta sampler servers came by to give me a dollop. Then it was several more minutes before the other two pastas came by. After I got all three of my pastas, no one came by to ask if they were good or if I wanted more. Which I really didn't since they were all mediocre with little flavor. In the meantime, date was unimpressed with the chicken. It was undercooked, rubbery and bland; the vegetables served with it were overcooked.  Given the issues with the timing of our drinks and dinner and the overall lack of attention, when our server finally came by to check on us, we told him we weren't happy and he said he would send the manager over. (This is something I learned reading about Mario Batali, who says, if you have an issue at my restaurant, take care of it at the table.) We told the manager our issues, he apologized for not meeting the standards of the restaurant, and said he would make an adjustment. If possible, the service got WORSE after we talked to him. I used the ladies' room and when I came back, our dirty plates were still in front of us. At this point one of the pasta servers finally came by to see if I wanted seconds - I'd been done eating and away from the table for at least 5 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fminutes.It&s=1222665e6a3afb251f300b39aa97d510a0bcbea972e2f031ef459558a7abe5d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">minutes.It</a> was a few more minutes before the server came by to take our plates and remind us that date got dessert with his meal. I looked at the clock to see how long it would take to get the dessert: 12 minutes. And when the dessert came it was ice cold and solid as a rock. The server asked if we liked it, we said it was just ok (which was being kind), and to his credit he offered to bring us the dessert menu and let us pick something else. But at this point we were done.  When we got the bill, the manager had comped the pasta sampler, which was literally the least he could do since it was the cheapest item and cost them nothing to prepare since they are making huge batches anyway. Definitely disappointing for a corporate-type restaurant like this with a decent reputation. Not recommended, won't go back.",

So he enjoyed pasta with meat sauce and meat balls.  Light on the sauce and seasoning on the meatballs.  We enjoyed the atmosphere-anniversary worthy, however the main dish we were unimpressed.

I ordered the pasta trio as my main entree and the gnocchi was good but I wasn't impressed with their rigatoni or the other pasta. The dessert table was okay too.

The pasta trio is a good way to sample the different kinds of pasta they make, which range from inventive to the usual staples.  All were good.  The servings were small, the better to sample the three different kinds of pasta, and the service was quick if you wanted more.  All the servers were friendly.  I liked the pasta, didn't absolutely love it and feel like I've gotten better pasta elsewhere.  I  am also taking another star off because it was a little expensive for having good (but not great) pasta.",

Just screaming early 90's, carpet everywhere, awful frilly fixtures and unneccesary flourishes all over the place.    But close your eyes and have a go at the bread and pasta. It's nearly impossible to go wrong with house made fresh pasta and theirs wasn't bad at all. The bread ruled. The bar menu was not a joke, featuring the likes of East End and Bell's, cocktails that weren't a punchline, probably good wine (I don't know anything in that dept. so I could be dead wrong, but my wife's house red was great).   It's not that cheap, and they make you pay for parking. And I still don't feel cool. But if there is a better-textured pasta in Pittsburgh I haven't had it. I always thought I would hate this place but I honestly liked it, a lot. So I guess don't be a closed minded jerk and deprive yourself of nice Italian food for no good reason.",

There was literally no good service during the whole visit.  Some lowlights include waiting too long for the server to greet us, slow to refill beverages, having her aggressively rub her nose with two fingers while taking our order, rudeness from a server who was at the dessert table (I asked what the dessert was in his hand, \"What is WHAT?\"), not being offered refills for the pasta tasting until she picked up my sons plate to clear it.    Didn't completely ruin the experience, the value was good for the quality of the food.  A few years back, there were none of these problems.  There was just no quality control outside of the kitchen today.",

Nice interior - very cool light fixtures and bottle display on the wall.  Now here's the part where I feel old!  It seemed like the space was dark on the inside and the contrast between the highly lit bottle wall and the interior darkness kind of made me feel blinded. Similarly, the light of outdoors on the other side did the same.  Ok - that's a minor thing.  The space did feel a little cool too - and a little heat wouldn't have been bad. The service was fairly good and everyone was happy. I tend to gravitate towards lighter meals that seem healthier. I'd give it a try again but tend to think I'd probably have to immediately split my meal in half and take it home as the portion sizes looked large and maybe not too healthy....",

What I ended up with was stuffed pasta that I'm 95% sure was reheated in a microwave, bland mains, and slow and inattentive service. The only highlight of the meal was the bread which was the only fresh ingredient used in the entire meal.",

Since I don't care for calamari I asked if I could just have extra shrimp instead and they said fine.  The shrimp was rubbery, smallish and completely without taste as was the whole dish.  I get better shrimp pasta at Macaroni Grill!  We traveled from Medina, Ohio for a lunch there and found it most disappointing although my husband enjoyed his pasta with red sauce.  The service was good and the staff very nice though.",

The Caesar salad was fine, but not inspiring. The three pastas were very, very basic. Only one, the linguini in a cream sauce had any hint of protein (small flecks of pancetta); it was OK and the only one we tried a small second helping of. The bow ties with a red sauce were not worth the time, and the ravioli with cheese were not worth the calories. The tiramisu for dessert was a tiny portion and also not impressive. The craziest was the wine to pick from their \"$32 List.\" All basic \"jug-type\" wines which retail for about $8 a bottle....so over four times retail. The only thing that saved the evening from disaster were our server and busser. Both polite, helpful and friendly. So even with the Groupon, with tax and tip you're talking $95....The poor slobs who paid full price would get hit for $104 plus tax and tip...$135...yikes!!!!",

This time I was heading to Kaya for Lunch with one of my more well rounded foodie friends from out of town when he saw Lidia's he made me make a U-turn because he had always wanted to try this place and has watched a lot of her shows on PBS.   He had the wild boar ravioli which was a plate of 3 large ravioli stuffed with a very flavorful boar meat concoction. The other partner in crime had the butter nut squash ravioli which was definitely a 5 star dish. Heck next time I eat here I think I will order a main entree and the butter nut squash ravioli for desert. I'm a big polenta fan so I went for the salsiccia which had polenta and broccoli rabe and house made sausage. The polenta was cooked perfectly along with the broccoli, the sausage that is in this dish is a great mild sausage. The sausage was not overpowering or spicy.  The price for each entree was right around $16. I think that the prices are right in line for the quality of food that is offered here. I highly recommend this place. Give it a try for yourself and I am certain that I will be back.",

    "text": "Had a wonderful dinner here after a week of being snowed in.  The heavy snow on the awning outside this restaurant gave it a festive look and I couldn't wait to enter!  The decor here is open and warehouse like with high ceilings-very appropriate to the Strip District area-but with the blown glass chandeliers dripping from the ceiling, the fireplace and warm colors, Lidia's is modern yet as warm and welcoming as any Italian household I've had the pleasure to visit and eat in.  The menu had a lot of traditional Italian fare and I was pleasantly surprised to see they had cabbage rolls too!  Everyone recommends the trio of pasta sampler, but I elected to go with their Monday night Tuscan prix fixe because the side offered was roasted butternut squash and who doesn't love THAT on a cold night looking outside at the blankets of white snow?!  The bread comes with a plate of some olive oil topped by a scoop of garbanzo bean and pesto and another small scoop of white beans blended with kalamata olives.  Divine!  My anitpasti course was described as lobster and shrimp brushcetta.  I got worried when what was served to me was half burnt toast with cold seafood salad mush on it.  My entree was a sliced beef dish that is typically served this side of rare, but I DID ask if I had it well-done would it be horrible.  The server reassured me, but it was very dry, so I learned my lesson there, BUT the butternut squash was HEAVEN. My little pasta trio sampler course wasn't really anything over the top spectacular, but neat to try.  This IS a step up from The Olive Garden, but perhaps my expectations were so great that it just fell short of fabulous.  Dessert MORE than made up for it!  The ladies I was dining with had the tiramisu and the meyer lemon panna cotta which made my whole face implode with pucker!  My biscotti was a delicate sampling of Italian style cookies that make Starbucks biscotti look like Chips Ahoy.  With a shot of ice cream affogato it took me all the way back to Roma!  Not to mention our charming sommelier Franco was very friendly and a joy to chat with!  In fact, all the servers and host and staff were extremely attentive and friendly DESPITE having probably had a very hectic Vday weekend!  If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I'll be returning for more espresso and ice cream and Franco!",

    "text": "I think this will bounce between a 3.5 and 4.5.  My caveats are these: we ate there on Valentine's Day while visiting Pittsburgh, though we didn't know it would be a prix fixe menu. Second, I love Lidia's cooking and have been waiting a long time to get to her place.  The restaurant is beautiful inside. The Valentine's menu was more limited than what I had hoped for - the whole menu - but it wasn't bad. We included the wine pairings with our menu. Bruschetta around as the first (with prosecco); the endive salad, tarte, and roasted beets (x2) for primi; three pastas (x2), swordfish, and salmon for mains. Both sets came with a selection of either a white or red wine. Dessert is four pieces per person (truffle, petit four, chocolate cookie, and one other), plus dessert wine. The food was excellent, with one misfire on the veggie version of the paparadelle (normally bolognese) - it was weak in the sauce and more tomato juice than sauce. Cost is an issue on the rating: the menu was $50 and the wine pairing (not required) was $25. Once you get into the $75 range pp, ($360 with tip), you actually expect a bit more than this - better wine, a few tweeks to the menu. I think that with a full menu we might do less food, different choices, and split a bottle of wine and get in for about $60 pp, which seems more reasonable to me.   I suspect a night with the full set of options would work out better. 3.5 for this night; probably more like 4.5 on another night. Definitely worth the trip.",

My husband was starving and opted for the pasta trio which included wheat pasta in a red sauce, rigatoni with a parmesan and garlic cream sauce, and finally ravioli in olive oil and garlic. All were fresh and delicious but my husband couldn't get enough of the ravioli.  I selected the gnocchi with duck Ragu and wasn't disappointed.  The duck was tender and the spice was complimentary but not overpowering. Of course the gnocchi was perfect.   We finished the night with the almond tort and ice cream trio.  Overall it was a very good meal at a fair value, we won't hesitate to return on our next visit to Pittsburgh.",

The three choices were penne with onions, sausage, and tomato ragu (the least favorite), Homemae fettucine aglio e olio with tomatoes and butternut squash (delicious and very fresh tasting for the fall), and homemade mushroom ravioli in a thyme butter sauce (the best selection by far and completely delicious) Dessert table (good selections with standouts being the tiramisu and the chocolate torte)  Overall this was a great brunch experience for the price as well as the selections.

I ordered the Pasta Tasting - and I wish I hadn't.  The whole wheat Paparelle was sugary, the penne a la vodka was watery, and the raviolle was soaked in butter. My parents meals were better, which is why I've given three stars.   That said, the atmosphere was beautiful and the antipasta and dessert tables were nicely laid out.    The kitchen is half open behind the bar, and unlike the open kitchens in NYC where the aestitics of the kitchen are well planned out, this kitchen had four colored pots and pans thrown on top of the shelves to make it look pretty. Umm, four pots?  and an industrial kitchen? not so cute.  Sadly, I didn't not love this place.",

It is a pasta place (Atkins may roll over) and they have a favorite dish called pasta trio- three different pasta, all you can eat.

I had the Pasta 3-course meal and was thrilled! - cesaer salad, all-u-can-eat 3 types of pastas and any dessert off of the dessert menu!  I thoroughly enjoyed 2 of the 3 pastas and particularly liked the meat raviolis.  Very tasty!  While it was an all-u-can-eat offer, we really didn't have much more than small amounts of each, as all the portions were hearty and filling.  The wine list had a selection of $28 bottles that were not fantastic, but tasty for the price.  And the ambiance was enjoyable.  Our group of 8 had pretty good service, and definitely enjoyed our experience there.

The service.... You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \"that kind\" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience. My very small office was saying goodbye to one of our coworkers, so we went to Lidia's for a boozy lunch. We were in high spirits and having a great time. The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table. Anyway, I didn't knock off a star for this, it doesn't seem important enough. But it did taint my visit. I remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food.  Oh, and don't bother with the tiramisu, it's all cream, almost no cake.  But the atmosphere is great, they really went all out with the interior design. The menu isn't particularly veg friendly, but it's not too bad. Lidia's does high-end traditional Italian without being too pretentious or too predictable. But I have no desire to eat what I ordered (the daily special pasta trio) again nor do I have any interest in trying anything else on the menu. Months later I decided to lower my stars from four to two. I really wanted to like this place, but I really didn't.  And I gotta talk about that wine list again, it's Lidia's only shining star. Of course, they have a pricey reserve list, but they have a whole bunch of really cheap, good bottles, and a bunch of wines by the glass too.",

    "text": "My cabbie recommended Lidia's. I wasn't sure what to think of it I just knew it was Italian food. It was a Thursday night and the place was dead. There were about 3 other tables. It wasn't because the place isn't good though. I think it might have much more to do with the economy...  I had Lidia's Trio del Giorno a la carte. The pastas were all good. Served right out of the pan, there was a penne with a red sauce, a linguine with peas and other veg, but I wasn't really paying much attention to those because they were serving goat cheese ravioli. I very nearly, almost exclusively ate the goat cheese ravioli. These were so tasty and cooked to perfection I very nearly ate until I was sick.  I was a bit disappointed in the wine selection by the glass. It seemed that most of everything I really wanted was only sold by the bottle. It turns out that in Pittsburgh you can have the restaurant re-cork the bottle and you can take it with you. Who knew? Regardless I ended up with a house wine that was adequate for the job.  All in all the place was just average. Even though my meal was fantastic it's mostly because I'm totally biased toward goat cheese. Strange bias I know. Everything else was just A-OK and the meal was pretty expensive for what it was.  I would go there again, but I'm going to explore more of Pittsburgh before I do.",

Our food was just average. My husband & I each had the Caesar salad which turned out to be the best part of the meal. I had the fish special - sauteed cod with spinach. The spinach added a bitterness to the cod and the cod itself would have benefited from a heavier hand with seasonings. My husband had the lasagne. He called it just average nothing worth getting again.",

    "text": "It was another concert night, but this time is was in the thick of my birthday weekend celebrations. A rendezvous with my childhood friend Dan, his enchanting wife, Devin Townsend, and France's metallic defenders of Mother Earth, Gojira was in the works. A normally simple matter of deciding where to dine prior to the Mr. Smalls concert became complicated when it was discovered that Cure and Meat & Potatoes --our original choices -- were both completely booked. Leaving the decision entirely in Dan's palms, he asked me to make a reservation at the Pittsburgh stronghold of famed Chef Lidia Bastianich. Successfully, I managed to snag a table for 5:45PM, and we scarcely arrived on time for this circus of the unusual, beautiful, and delectable to begin.   My mother, a fan of Bastianich's PBS program for years, has raved about Lidia's ever since it opened. And Lordy, does mama know best.   Taking into account Bastianich's traditionalism, the strange menu items shocked me when I scouted the bill of fare online, but once I saw dishes involving octopus and wild boar, there wasn't much else for me to consider...   Thus is...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFUQusWJb8UQ&s=35b491b9aef4b227fed0756a9c6a8981c7134693a4e3b77dbc068612d6c833cd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=FUQu...</a>  Weirder still was the decor. A fireplace was upstaged by large, illuminated, multi-colored, stained-glass circles and ceiling fixtures that resembled either gargantuan bunches of extradimensional grapes or prehistoric insect hives or chandeliers conceived by alien glassblowers.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYtSnXU8DfCA&s=b7af4ca615e9a81434b4346fa4002001563f0a2983e8b5392d5aec15eccd914d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=YtSn...</a>  The first act consisted of a varied bread basket that was escorted by two spreads of pesto, ground chickpeas, and olive oil. Each scoop resembled a gelato but when slathered onto the myriad forms of fresh bread became something akin to a hummus. Alas, I sampled the breads carefully, wary of allowing myself to be too filled with grains to ravish the remainder of what would prove to be an astonishing meal.  Frico came next. A crisped flap of Montasio cheese cloaked potatoes, leeks, apple and sausage and nearly fooled my dining companions and I into thinking we were eating an omelet  or frittata with a sharp flavor. The apples added tartness and amplified the cheese. The sausage brought the brine. The leeks, shy vegetables that they are, hid happily amidst the fray like Tom Waits did during Cinemax's black-and-white Roy Orbison concert of 1988.   From the sea rose the second appetizer in Polipo. The dismembered Kraken was surrounded by potatoes, pickled onion, Gaeta olives, and capers. The tubers filled out the dish, making it all the meatier. The tentacles themselves tasted of scallops on the fatter parts only to recall lobster tail as they tapered off, onions, olives, and capers placing sweet and salty punctuation marks at the end of the sentence.   Wild Boar: The Godpig. It serves as the avatar of Lord Vishnu. In the low 1800's it instilled fear into English villagers as the Beast of Dean. Brave as they are ferocious, they have been known to appear on coats of arms. Their tusks have been known to cripple stout men and have killed tigers to defend themselves and their young.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DaHW2HJo9RBs&s=9e133f0b70c22243ccbca8f807b4391c1c01bf1d82cb9708611db76383030b45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=aHW2...</a>  And one would never think that a slaughtered razorback would become so delicately savory when braised and placed within a supple trio of oversized ravioli. Topped with a scarlet sauce imbued with rosemary, that most aromatic, divinatory, and memory-improving herb, the dish's savage origins were forgotten as bloody struggle gave way to a love affair. Only Lidia could work such bewitchment. It was as if she had taken an ogre and with a wave of her hand turned it into a flock of doves.   Dessert was as holy as a harlot. Torta di Cioccolatta is her tag, bringing you to lust-stained submission is her...bag, and it is full of tricks. Wounded, bleeding amarena cherries and candied walnuts orbit her...heavenly body of fudge, milk chocolate mousse, and white chocolate ganache. She is a complex creature, one of layers, all of which conspired to make each bite immoral, immortal alchemy, and the last was agony for...I craved more of her.  Lidia, Lidia, Lidia, what spell have you cast onto me? What web have you woven around my gastronomic soul?   Dinner at Lidia's is an opera -- a grand, opulent, fantastical opera for the palate and stomach as well as the heart.   P.S. Our darling of a server was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and awfully proficient. I believe her name was Emily, and we adored her.   P.P.S. When making the reservation, I was told that the dress code is business casual. I was able to get away with wearing dressy jeans and a dapper, long-sleeved top. Oh you know there was a metal concert tee underneath. I changed in the restroom before departing to Mr. Smalls.",

We decided to go ahead and try the brunch which includes a brunch drink, bread basket, anti pasta bar, entree and dessert bar.  The bread basket was delicious with the unique butter that they served with. The anti pasta bar was great as well, my favorite was the Caesar salad and the egg frittata. Then I tried their tomato bean soup, to my surprise it was very tasty and most important of all, it was temperature hot. I like my soup to be as hot as it can be and many restaurants fail to do so.   Moving on to the entree, I ordered the pasta trio and it was both surprising and disappointing. I'm not a gnocchi fan, but to my surprise the gnocchi was very tasty! However, the butternut squash pasta was blend, dry and tough, I only took one bite. The bow tie bolognese tasted ok, definitely had better bolognese else where.  Overall, I expect all three pasta to taste awesome, yet only one of them passed.   My husband ordered the beef liver and said it taste ok, he's definitely had better liver at other place.   Last, but not least goes to the dessert bar. They offered a good selection of desserts but I was way too full to try everything so I just tried the tiramisu. It's definitely one of the best tiramisu I've ever had. I only wish I had more room to devour.  Overall, I appreciate most of the dishes but just had wish that the entree tasted better. It's the most important part of the meal so I expect it to taste great as well. Other than that, service was excellent! Our waiter explain everything in detail to us.",

Wonderful, warm, and festive, the Saturday before Christmas. Professional staff and an elegant warmth impressed us at this Italian restaurant in P'burgh's strip district.  I loved looking at the decor in Lidia's. The massive slate fireplace looks like something out of Game of Thrones and I couldn't help but imagine a giant pig roasting in it. The chandeliers and the accent lights are made of handblown glass globes. The main dining room chandeliers are beautiful, in and of themselves, but they are not lit to their best advantage. Clearly expensive and complicated, but not well thought through.  All that aside, the beer was great, the pumpkin custard was fabulous and we had a great time walking back to the hotel in the warm Pittsburgh rain.",

It's bright, cheery and warm inside the building - makes for a lovely Sunday brunch.   My brothers, younger than me with basic American taste buds, hate it here - far too traditional for them. So, I suppose it's very palate based. Maybe not the best restaurant for children.",

    "text": "Beautiful atmosphere, but totally overrated.  Unfortunately, we went here to celebrate my hubby's bday, and when we left he told me that he would have rather gone to the Grand Concourse, LOL!  I guess I expected fabulous--but everything was just good, nothing spectacular.  First off, our waiter was in training, and even though we met his mentor, she didn't seem to keep tabs on him.  Small things were overlooked, like no coffee refills or spoons, tons of dirty dishes and empty glasses on the table.  He was accommodating, but we had to ask for too many things multiple times.  The one thing that REALLY IRRITATED me was that I saw one of the young waiters who was serving the pasta from the serving platters, stick his fork in one of the platters and shove the ravioli in his mouth as he was standing right in the door of the kitchen.  Truly, made me sick--was glad my hubby and daughter had already eaten their ravioli.  :-/  The food--Two of us had the pasta trio, meh--the ravioli was good, not so much for the other two dishes.  One of us had the cannelloni and ate it all up.  One of us had the pork loin dish--it was dry but tasty.  And then I had the lemon chicken.  It was actually good, right up my alley with bright notes of lemon and caper!  But, my favorite thing was the antipasta bar--the dessert bar was little to be desired.    We will not be back.",

    "text": "Service was excellent.  The menu offerings were spotty.  A group 16 of us attended the Saints-Steelers game in November.  We attend most of the away games and have an opportunity to eat at some very good restaurants.    Lidia's was a place I was looking forward to because I am aware of her by reputation.   We had several appetizers including the bruschetta, which was really only to my liking.  The balsamic was excellent - syrupy and sweet - and clearly a nicely aged one.  But it was incongruous with the rest of the dish, and so not many enjoyed it.    The bread served at the table was really very good and we devoured baskets of it.   Comments from some of the other diners:  - Baked shrimp appetizer was pretty good, the calamari was very good.   - Rucola  salad was (in my opinion) excellent - Beet salad was interesting and overall very good - Butternut squash soup was enjoyed by several of us - Scampi alla Felidia was ordered by several guests with mixed opinions - Lasagna bolognese?  so so at best  Gnocchi and duck ragu was what I ordered.  I was very disappointed. The duck was shredded and cooked into a sort of red congealed, thick mass with little texture.  The gnocchi were so underdone as to be a sort of glutinous paste sitting under the duck.  The texture was completely unappealing but I do have to say that the flavor of the duck ragu (ragout?) was pretty good.   Still, the gnocchi - one of my favorite things and something I make myself probably once a month - were a disappointment.  I didn't send it back because it didn't seem appropriate in the setting of a very large group to monopolize the wait staff.    I'd still give it a try again when I'm there in June, but it seems that some of their efforts are focused more on being creative, which is good, but falling somewhat short.  By the way, if you like a more traditional Italian and happen to be in St. Louis, Charlie Gitto's on the Hill is a great place. Similar in ambiance and quality to Lidia's, the service there can't be beat and the food is quite good as well.",

    "text": "SO DISAPPOINTED! I love Lidia Bastianich, I enjoy watching her on PBS especially when she cooks her \"traditional\" Italian foods, red sauce, Bolognese, pastas, meats etc. In addition we have many of Lidia's cook books, and I personally cook Italian all the time and if I say so I am a very good cook. We have not been to Lidia's in awhile and remember it to be good. Not so much this time!   The server even though she said she has worked at Lidia's for over 10 years seemed a bit distracted, she was adequate, but not completely focused, which I could get by. We started with salads, which were mostly just OK, my wife ordered the Caesar which came highly recommended, it was flavorless (which seemed to be the theme of the evening) and 80% of the Romaine lettuce was the inner rib of the leaf, which is tough and bitter. If the kitchen had any pride in the food it presents they would take the time to clean the lettuce properly, especially for a Caesar, she did not finish it and it was taken off the check.   I ordered the Zuppa Di Pesce, a classic Italian seafood dish, which if prepared correctly should have enormous flavors from the shell fish broth, and normally would be perfect for dunking a great piece of crusty Italian bread, not so much and in fact the bread that came with it was burnt! All of the seafood was so overcooked that it was not eatable! calamari, was not rubbery, but hard as a rock, the lobster tail was impossible to get out of the shell it was cooked so much. The broth literally had 0 flavor. It was to be served with Couscous, an inexpensive Israeli pasta, I swear there were 10 pieces of the pasta, crazy. I asked for more which they brought but by that time I had decided that the dish was uneatable, I mean really at an Italian restaurant. I was so disappointed that I did not order anything else! The other dishes that were served were fine, not great just average. Plus, my opinion would be to quit with the Pasta Trio, dish seems a bit DONE!!!  I also drive for Uber part time, and have taken many people who have been in Pittsburgh for business to the airport, and several of them have said that they did it at Lidia's, but thought it was just OK!  This is sad for an Italian family with the reputation of the Bastianich's to be serving food like this that leaves a customer not wanting to return or recommend it to any one!!!",

    "text": "I think this place is good but over-hyped and over-priced for what it is.  I had the pasta trio and I got the combo which came with a Ceasar salad and a dessert.  The pasta trio by itself is $18 but with the salad and dessert is $32 (an extra $14, so not such a great deal!).  $18 for pasta with no meat or seafood in it is already way overpriced and ought to come with a soup or salad anyway.  So I was expecting this to be an amazing Ceasar salad but it was the worst I've ever had at a nice restaurant.  Instead of romaine lettuce, most of the lettuce was iceberg!  And the dressing was too vinegary and did not taste very good.  And I had hoped being an Italian place they would offer anchovies on it, but that was not the case.    The pasta trio was tasty and included a goat cheese ravioli with cream sauce, a fettucine with sundried tomatoes, and a penne with a pork ragu sauce.  All were good but I felt like they had been sitting out for awhile and didn't taste freshly cooked, and the texture of one of the pastas was slightly chewy.  It was fun to see them all come over with their bowls though and the guy with the parmesan was also right there ready to grate some fresh cheese for you.    For the bread, instead of butter they had these interesting things made out of a couple different sorts of bean which tasted rather like a hummus so that was interesting though would have been nice if the bread was warm.   I had the tiramisu for dessert which was good but nothing amazing.    The atmosphere was really nice with some interesting artwork and chandeliers and the service was prompt and polite.  However the food was kind of disappointing.  Honestly I think I like Olive Garden better and they have much better prices.",

Lidia's is a surprisingly large space which is decorated nicely and has great service.  The food however, is good but by no means mind blowing.  Their signature Pasta Trio lets you try 3 different pastas (served out of a pan tableside) and then choose if you want to get seconds on any of them.  All of the pastas are cooked perfectly and fresh but the sauces just don't blow me away, they are missing that last ingredient or two which would take them from good to excellent.  Given that I had better pasta at a place called Meat & Potatoes the next evening I think says something.  Bread served at the beginning of the meal is warm and really outstanding, but the spreads weren't exciting.  The wine list is nice and the atmosphere is generally upscale but friendly.  Now that I think back about Lidia's, I have to say I do appreciate the homemade pasta and I'll potentially be back but it's just a bit on the pricey side for Pittsburgh so I have to presume they're going on the name at this point.",

    "text": "I stopped by here with my wife a couple of Tuesdays ago for dinner.  My wife and I go to the Strip District fairly often and whenever we pass Lidia's I always comment on how I haven't been there in a long time.  So whenever a three course tasting with a bottle of wine popped up on Groupon, I quickly purchased it and made the reservations for us.  The inside of Lidia's is a really nice looking place with the walls having nice shades of yellow, an exposed beams ceiling, a huge fireplace in one corner, some cutouts in the walls with bottles of wine from Italy and tables covered in white tablecloths.  Since we had purchased the groupon our meals were pretty much predetermined for us.  We started off our meal with a caesar salad that had grana padano cheese on it.  Whenever it was delivered to our table I was impressed with the size of it as it took up a whole dinner plate.  While I enjoyed the salad immensely, I can imagine that someone who doesn't like as much dressing as myself would find the salad to be overdressed.  Our entrees ended up being the pasta trio which you are able to get refilled as many times as you want.  On this night the trio consisted of a spaghetti with tomato and herb sauce, an orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe and a gnocchi with sage butter sauce.  My favorite of the bunch had to have been the gnocchi as the gnocchi itself was light and fluffy and the sauce was seriously amazing.  The orecchiette was my second favorite and I enjoyed the addition of the sausage and broccoli rabe to it.  My least favorite of the bunch was the spaghetti which seemed a little boring compared to the rest.  I did really enjoy the al dente pasta from it though.  Our dessert was supposed to be the tiramisu but since I am unable to each chocolate I asked the server if it was possible to substitute in another dessert.  If it wasn't possible then my wife was going to be in luck as we would have just taken mine home.  Thankfully though they were able to substitute another dessert in and I ended up choosing the ice cream trio.  I can only remember the mascarpone and blood orange granita as the flavors that I had and its worth it to note that each ice cream came with a cute miniature cookie.  The blood orange granita was easily my favorite of the bunch as it was like eating italian ice with the flavor being slightly sour and also slightly sweet.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back to Lidia's again in the future.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good Lidia's really was and I could see myself going back here again in the future just to have the pasta trio.",

Steering customers away from their signature offering, the pasta trio, because they are \"busy\" isn't acceptable. I watched as two tables near us were brought the wrong dishes. The servers seemed confused. I really wanted to like this, but there's no reason to go here with all the other options available. While not perfect, exponentially better than Lidia's is Eleven, nearby on Smallman.",

Spots like Spoon, Grit & Grace, Salt. . .these guys are doing great things, so it was easy to forget about the old standards.  Back to Lidia's. . .the menu has remained consistent, with a nice selection of northern Italian and continental dishes. The special $25 wine list is now the $32 wine list, but there are still a few bargains in there. The food on what looked like a fairly slow Saturday night was good. Not mind-blowing, but the quality was consistent with Lidia's tradition. The braised rabbit dish was delicious, as was the osso buco. I had the \"roasted beet salad\", which actually had pickled beets, not roasted. But it was tasty.  Now, the problem. . .service was insanely slow and inattentive. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, but she would disappear for huge chunks of time, leaving us with empty glasses and plates, and no food. All told, from seating to departure, dinner for two lasted exactly three hours, at least an hour was spent just sitting, waiting, wishing. It became aggravating when spending in excess of $100 per person, and at the end of the night you have to track down the waitress to give her your credit card. I expect that at Denny's, but not Lidia's. It really looks like they need a stronger manager keeping things running smoothly, because while the food is still excellent, I saw nobody in control of the dining room. This review could have easily been two stars, but I added one for the tasty rabbit.",

A few minutes after the order is placed she comes out and says no lasagna- hmmmm ok- I took the carbonara. Appetizers came out slowly- Caesar salad I tasted was excellent and so were my artichokes. Seems like the starters are always better! 45 minutes later our food came out. Not great- Zappa do peshci cool and rubbery- toasted bread with it toasted til black! I mean burned.

We waited awhile to order drink, get drinks, to order, for our food, etc. We didn't have a steady waiter or waitress either but other tables seemed to have one. I was the only one that really liked my meal. I ordered pasta in a garlic oil sauce with squash and it had a good taste for such a simple dish. The other three people with me said the flavoring or their dish was either lacking or too powerful (too much pepper). One got a Caesar salad and said it was good.    A positive was that they do offer a trio endless pasta opinion. I believe the dishes change either daily or weekly and they bring the hot pasta in pans right to your table so you can try all three while also getting as much as you want.",

I ordered the baked ziti and my spouse ordered lasagna.  While the ZITI CON POLPETTINE was a generous portion, the lasagna was not.  Honestly my spouse said that he had eaten better lasagna elsewhere, and sampling his, I will agree.  For dessert we ordered the follow:  CROSTATA DI MELE Roasted Apple Crostata with Toasted Almond, Oatmeal Crumble and Vanilla Ice Cream and the SORBETTO E GELATI Trio of House-Made Ice Creams and Sorbets.  The former was not as billed.  I never found the oatmeal crumble and the apples could have been baked more.  The Gelati was so disappointing because each of the three house made ice creams would have starved a Barbie doll. Each was the size of a dippin dot.  Definitely over priced and under portioned.  I suggest if you have a sweet tooth, skip dessert at Lidia's and head on over to Grandpa Joe's Candy Shop on Penn Avenue a seven block stroll on a street one block south of her Smallman Street restaurant.  This place is sweet treat heaven.",

The parking is a little strange in the area, there were some street spots close by and a large empty lot across the street that I couldn't quite figure out where to enter (or if it was public). I think valet was available. I was able to make the reservation through Open Table. The restaurant space is very nice, it has high ceilings and the far wall looks pretty cool with lighting and wine bottles. The service was not great despite the restaurant not being too full, we had two different people coming to our table but even so we felt like we were a bit neglected at times. Drinks are pricy, the pear martini was blah. They gave us a basket with average bread and crackers and didn't say what the spreads were. Our food took awhile to arrive. I had the ziti and overall it was very uneven in consistency throughout, some parts undercooked and some overcooked (mainly the pasta). They did bring a dessert for someone celebrating a birthday which was nice. Overall though, I think Pittsburgh does better Italian food elsewhere.",

Upon receiving our entrees, I immediately could taste... nothing. It truly tasted like a plate full of ricotta and the noodles were so over cooked and thin, they all slid off of the layers of cheese, etc. then onto the plate, making it look not so appetizing.   I sadly sent it back as I couldn't eat such a tasteless meal, I then order a baked ziti type dish... with meatballs that had chunks of garlic so large I was in desperate need of mouthwash after just the two I tried.

The atmosphere was very open, and had nice decor, though felt a little like a large food hall in a university. The bar area was really nice though, and upstairs it looked like there was a nice private event space.  The bread you first get came with a less than appetizing plate of a green and purple/brown spread. We weren't told what it was (would have been appreciated), but it tasted vegetable-y. It was alright, though the look of it dissuaded my partner from trying it.  As an appetizer, we ordered the fritto misto -- a calamari, shrimp, and veggie plate. It was good, but very heavy for an appetizer. I'd definitely recommend having more than two people to share it. Some of the veggies were a bit odd breaded, but the actual calamari and shrimp were good. My only real problem was that it needed salt and pepper badly! I understand not having it on the tables, but make sure things are seasoned in the kitchen!  As far as our actual meal, we were surprised to learn they were already out of two of the four pasta entrees. We went there around six, so this was unexpected and disappointing. However, we both ended up ordering the three course meal, which included a caesar salad, an unlimited sampling of three pre-selected pastas, and a dessert. The three pastas this day were a homemade brown butter / pine nut gnocchi, a homemade fettuccini alfredo, and an imported rigatoni with a delicious onion/pepper/meat sauce. The last was my partner's favorite, and the first mine. It was very good pasta, and though you had unlimited samplings, we couldn't handle any seconds due to the appetizer and salad. I like the concept of a changing pasta sampler, but it's not a wow kind of meal as far as presentation or taste.  We were too full for dessert, but I took a piece of tiramisu home with me and it was awesome. I've yet to hear how the cannolo were (3 small cannoli).  Oh! And the drink I had was awesome -- violet gimlet. I had two.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but don't plan on driving an hour to get there again anytime soon. I have to admit I expected a bit more being that it belongs to Lidia Bastionich, particularly in terms of presentations of the restaurant / food, but it was a good meal. The prices were set pretty well for what the food was -- just some good Italian.",

They had a bar, but no food and did not accept credit cards - so I continued to run back and ran into Lidia's.   Here, they had a beautiful bar and very nice Italian food. The lighting and overall ambiance was very pleasant.   I ordered a nice Caesar Salad. - was nice and tasty. Then I tried the eggplant parm. I received the plate and I felt the food was not hot enough. I tried to eat a quarter of it and then complained to my bartender (Alexander).   He immediately took my plate apologized and walked away. Moments later, the appeared with a fresh plate with super hot eggplant parm. It was excellent.   I was happy that he was so quick to respond and the kitchen quick to provide an excellent dish.   I enjoyed the fresh food and ambiance. I would return when working downtown.",

The Brunch has a Table with Breads soup and salad and antipasti to choose from and as much as you would like, all very tasty. For the main course you can choose pasta 3 kinds served table side or from the menu we choose from the menu, I had the Cannelloni with ricotta and spinach and my husband had Gnocchi with braised duck ragu both were very good. Then there is dessert table to choose which dessert you would like they are bit size so it is nice to be able to choose a couple different ones to taste. The Tiramisu was delicious very nice taste not to strong it was very nice. Staff was very friendly although are waiter could have been a little bit better, he only came back once to fill my water glass so I had to drink some of my husbands water and we would have loved to order some coffee after meal but he was no where around. There is parking lots across the street on Smallman Street, $8.00 to park",

The restaurant was pretty empty and our server would go long distances of time without stopping by. We all ran out of our drinks multiple times and had to wait to flag him down.   I was very under impressed by the food. I got baked ziti. It was just bland - seemed like it had very little seasoning. Everyone at my table was also underwhelmed with their food. Expected a lot more based on the reviews and prices.   I will say the only things people at the table enjoyed were the Caesar salad and the tiramisu. But all the pasta dishes fell a bit flat.",

The food is basic with little to really recommend it. Go for the experience not the food.   When Lidia is in town for an event, the place sparkles. The food is much better and adventurous without being too fussy. It is always a set menu so the kitchen can focus on the same courses for each table. The wait staff is always great during the events because the owner and general manager are there for the service and can oversee the staff. Best part is to meet her, get a cookbook autographed and a picture with her. She is so sweet to everyone.  Wonderful lady!",

Wonderful and attentive service, nice atmosphere, and large portions of tasty food. I had the gnocchi, which comes with duck ragu - fantastic! I'm a huge fan of duck, and this was a new approach for me. The duck played really well with the thick ragu sauce. Not the best potato dumplings in a gnocchi, but still quite good. My friends dishes were also great, especially the lasagna which was massive.  A nice comfort Italian joint with some unique twists and lovely service. Strikes me as a good spot that can please many different tastes.",

    "text": "Visited here on Thursday evening (3/20) around 6:30 pm for dinner.  It was not packed although there were several patrons and more walking in as we were leaving.  No wait time.  I noticed upstairs they had a conference room enclosed with glass walls - looks like it would be a nice place for a birthday party or small private engagement.  The food:  Bread - The complimentary bread basket had a mixture of parmesan bread sticks and a couple other bread variations.  It came with two bean type dips and olive oil.  The parmesan bread stick is so good!!! I would've hoarded it all if I weren't on a business trip.  Alas, I had to pretend to be civilized and eat only two.  The bread was good, nothing that stood out, but I love bread I'll eat it anyway.  Fish of the day - I ordered the fish of the day which was rainbow trout over farro.  It came with some sort of creamy sauce that brought everything together perfectly.  A lot of times, the grains that come with the dish are pretty simple, I felt the farro was seasoned to bring out the flavor and texture of it rather than masking it.  I ate every single bit, it was so good.  Dessert - Ordered the biscotti/cookie dessert which came with one scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over the top in affogato style.  It came with an assortment of cookies, none of which were too sweet.  It came with two of each of Anise and almond biscotti, peanut butter cookie with chopped peanuts, some sort of dark cocoa crispy biscotti type cookie, spice cookie - like ginger molasses, pistachio cookies, and chocolate crinkle cookies. All were pretty small and probably around 1.5\" in diameter.  It would be a good dessert to share, but I don't share and I don't share desserts of all things.  The one cookie I liked the least was the crispy dark cocoa thing, I don't know what it is.  I really liked the spice cookie.  The chocolate crinkle cookie was very fudgy and almost like a brownie in a cookie form.   Service was great, although a little pretentious.  Restaurant nice, clean, and upscale, and food came out fast, piping out, and perfect!  Price is fair for the quality.  I would definitely return here!",

Wettest, limpest Caesar salad I ever had, couldn't finish half of it. Pasta trio was bizarre. Three disjointed pastas that fight each other in flavor are piled on your plate. Penne undercooked. Fettuccine flaccid. Only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli. Too rich, though.   We were there for an hour and fifteen minutes, two courses, and it wasn't that busy. Waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine. Crazy. We got the tiramisu to go, I couldn't deal with this place any more.   Lighting is distracting, felt like I was in a food court in the mall. Carpet was all jacked up. Looked like fraternity house carpet. Clientele was strange...lots of sleeveless T's and baseball hats. I didn't even see that the one time I was at the Olive Garden.  Staff was inattentive and bothered.   I was really looking forward to going, as we love (tangentially) related restaurants Babbo & Esca.   Never again.",

This restaurant has been on our list for quite some time, and with restaurant week we finally decided to try something in a different part of town. What a disappointment. The service was average, but the dishes themselves were so incredibly bland that it was like we ate nothing. I ordered the chicken with mushrooms, grana padano, tomatoes, spinach, and garlic-the only thing I actually tasted in that dish was the spinach, and there was way too much of it. My husband ordered the roasted cod al Matalotta with grilled polenta-the only thing he could taste was polenta. He couldn't even finish half of his dish (which is unheard of), and we regret that we even took home the leftovers. Even more telling, the table next to us sent some of their dishes back.  Bottom line--although the ambiance and the location was nice, I do not recommend this place.",

Not at all what we had wanted guests to experience. Our waiter hovered asking too many questions, but missed a few details.

For our entrees My boyfriend and my father had both ordered the pasta trio which was good but the rigatoni was very undercooked. My father had ordered a side of meatballs with his trio that never came. My sister had ordered the gnocci and it was lukewarm when it got to the table. My mother had ordered the braised lamb shank with Swiss chard and sweet potatoes, either the Swiss chard was minced or it wasn't on the plate, and she thought that the sweet potatoes were too sweet although my father and boyfriend thought they were okay. Chendo brought her a new side of regular mashed potatoes very quickly. My brother had ordered the beef short ribs and thought his dish was excellent. I had ordered the Sunday special which is braised pork shoulder, Italian sausage, and meatballs over rigatoni. I had no issues with my entree and enjoyed it thoroughly. During dinner my father had ordered a taste of an artichoke liquor for us to try and it didn't come till after we finished our entrees and realized it never came. Over all the experience was great, and my sister and I had a great birthday dinner.",

Their staff is the best, they are so pleasant and accommodating and make me feel like they not only want to make sure you have the absolute best Italian food Pittsburgh has to offer, but that you have a very enjoyable experience while eating here.

When you walk in, I love the hanging glass blown chandeliers, the look of the open kitchen, the wine prominently displayed on the back wall.  It just looks welcoming and inviting, a little trendy, but not too trendy to make me feel like I'm not cool enough to eat there!  The hostess is always friendly and quick to seat you.  I'd definitely recommend reservations if possible as they can get pretty busy both on weekdays and especially weekends.  The food is amazing.  Have you seen her cooking shows on PBS?  It's just like that, times 1000 because you actually get to eat it, not just watch her cook it.  I've never had something I didn't like here, though I do have some favorites.  The duck breast is wonderful.  Perfectly cooked and prepared with a sweet cherry sauce all served over polenta.  Wait, I think I'm drooling :-)  Their tasting trio of pastas changes daily with one imported and two dry pastas and varying sauces based on the day.  Most of the time these are delicious, I've had a very few where they are good, but don't knock my socks off.  Just depends on your taste.  The servers do an excellent job describing the daily specials, so go with their recommendations and input.  Oh yeah, don't forge the tasting trio is all you can eat so come hungry!  I almost forgot the breadbasket!  Always delicious with focaccia bread, cheesy breadsticks, and Tuscan style Italian bread served with a kalamata olive spread, garbanzo bean spread (amazing!) sitting in a moat of olive oil.  It's hard not to fill up on the bread!  If you enjoy wine, try their wine of the month by glass or bottle.  I often get it and have never had one I didn't enjoy.  The servers are always on point with excellent wine and food recommendations based on your personal tastes.  They are quick with refills, more bread and are very capable of dealing with reasonable special requests.  It's really a blessing that Lidia picked Pittsburgh as a location for one of her restaurants.  If you haven't checked it out, no better time than now for some delicious Italian food and wine!",

    "text": "Lidias is a classy restaurant in the strip district. There's valet parking for $6 if you so wish to do so.  You step inside and see that its not a super large restaurant,  but it is large enough and has a cozy feel to it.  The light fixtures are brightly colored glass and are beautiful.  Take a look at the bar on the back wall, because it is very striking.  You dont have to dress up, but it doesnt hurt to look a little bit because you dont want a chandelier to upstage you!  The menu is a two pager and everything looked very good.  My group all ordered the pasta trio.  The trio included a spaghetti type with roasted cauliflower and tomatoes, penne with ragu and mushroom ravioli. Each pasta was delicious and it was impossible to choose a favorite.  The servings are unlimited so you dont have to miss any pasta for very long before more is brought to you.  Each pasta satisfied a different food craving (light, hearty and rich) and this is what made it difficult to choose a favorite.  Dessert was also very good and I had split the chocolate cake with my uncle. Just in case you're wondering,  the chocolate cake has no shredded coconut so eat away! The description mentions coconut several times and ordinarily I'm scared that it will have shredded coconut,  but this was safe.    Lidias was a great experience and I'm glad I went.  I think its worthy of 5 stars because the service, food and atmosphere was wonderful.  Tutti a tavola a mangiare!",

Anyway - the trio consisted of three very different pastas which are apparently are frequently changed up.  I loved our Groupon intro and would not hesitate to go back for a wider menu experience",

The antipasti(appetizer) portion of the meal was served family style but the portions were not enough for the six adults at our table. The desserts were nothing special and actually disappointing.

Our waitress Cindy (whom we have before) is spot on, not only with her wine suggestions and food recommendations, she's just nice and knowledgeable.    When our bus person noticed how much I liked the breadsticks, she kept our breadbasket full.  Her name is Tammy and she is outstanding and will make a great server.  She's wonderful!!

    "text": "This restaurant has been on my bucket list for years, and finally last night I got the chance to go!  We walked in at 7pm on Saturday evening and were seated right away.  Parking on the street after 6pm is free btw, a friendly lot attendant told us that so we wouldn't pay in a lot.  We ordered three appetizers- meatballs, grilled octopus, and focaccia with preserved tomatoes, mozzarella and a pork tapenade type spread.  The meatballs were fantastic, they were served over large pieces of grilled bread and we should have eaten them first because by the time we got to them the bread was a little soggy.  Rookie mistake on our part.  The focaccia was almost like a pizza, and it had a very smoky flavor to it that was just ok... it wasn't something I'd order again but I'm glad we tried it.  But the clear all star from our appetizers was the octopus.  It was grilled and dressed simply and served with asparagus and spring vegetables.  It was exactly what I love best about Lidia's recipes- good fresh seasonal food simply prepared.  The octopus wasn't chewy at all.  Amazing.  For dinner I ordered the Zuppa di Pesce, and it was quite good (though it needed salt).  There was a lot of seafood in there and the mussels in particular were really great.  They were seared first which is a nice touch.  It was served over couscous, and I think in retrospect pasta would be a better choice because there wasn't very much couscous and it ended up sort of blending in.  My friend got the pasta tasting- three cheese ravioli with pear, a corn Alfredo over pasta and a hollow spaghetti pasta with a red sauce.  She said the pear ravioli was an unexpected combo but the other two were fantastic- and two of the pastas were made in house.  For dessert it was my friend's birthday so our server brought out a trio of sorbets- a blueberry, a pineapple and cherry flavor that actually tasted like pineapple and coconut and had candies orange rinds in the bottom that were amazing, and a raspberry (or maybe mixed berry) sorbet that was also lovely.  We would have never ordered sorbet but it ended up being the perfect ending to our meal and that pineapple one with the candied orange was AMAZING.  I'm surprised this restaurant wasn't more crowded.  We had a great meal and will absolutely return.",

We heard by word of mouth how great this place is and in our personal Italian Food Tour this was going to be the gold standard.  Our experience with the staff and service was amazing. Everyone was so excited to be working there and that definitely boosted our moods! They have a staff member for everything; the waiter, the cheese grater, the food deliverer, and the food clearer! The ambiance of the place was less formal than I was expecting; more tren We loooooved their complimentary assorted bread bowl and their home made pesto paste in oil and garbanzo bean paste in oil!  I ordered the Gnocchi with duck bolognese and my boyfriend ordered their specialty: pasta trio which was a creamy gnocchi, spicy shrimp pasta and pesto tortellini (unlimited!!). We get so excited when we hear Italian restaurants make their own pasta! My gnocchi was very well cooked. However my boyfriends pasta and tortellini were mushy. (This may have something to do with the \"unlimited\" aspect; maybe it's being constantly warmed and that made it mushy?). We also don't think any of the dishes were spectacular regarding flavor; just very bland. My duck was amazing and tender, I just wish the bolognese was more flavorful to bring the dish together.  I would definitely come back because maybe it was an off night! I'd love to try their daily special or a protein dish!",

    "text": "We had a horrible experience today at Lidia's. I'm just disappointed in the staff and management more than anything else. We had just sat down for brunch and the waitress had literally just poured water for my father-in-law and she knocked it over and the entire glass landed on him and soaked him.  We all stood up to discuss what to do and the waitress just said sorry and walked away. We decided to leave since he was soaked and I told the hostess what happened, hoping maybe she would get a manager and she just said okay. I was so upset that I asked to see the manager on duty. His response was about the same as everyone else. Literally just an \"okay.\"  What was I expecting? A more immediate response from the staff and management. An \"I'm so sorry this happened, what can I do to rectify this? We want to turn this situation around for you because we value that you decided to dine with us.\" It was just clear they could care less. They basically ruined our Father's Day brunch. I'm now sitting at Eat n' Park waiting for a to go order.   I've worked in the service industry for years. I understand that accidents happen. I've dumped orange juice on a dudes crotch on Christmas Eve! I was basically bowing down and saying I'm so sorry what can I do... and I was a teenager! The real issue is the staff response and, most astoundingly, the managements response. I'm just really disappointed and we have been customers for years, as this is my husband's favorite restaurant.   I truly am not seeking compensation or anything free. I most importantly want this poor service to be addressed. I just would have expected more from Lidia's, more than a mumbled sorry and \"okay.\"",

    "text": "It took me a while to write and publish this review because I was so distraught after my experience at this establishment. I almost thought that if I could suppress the memory, then I could forget that certain types of discrimination still exist in our society.  My experience is from when I dined at this restaurant on May 5th. To preface, it was marathon weekend (I was running!), my parents were in from out of town and it was my mom's birthday. After seeing raving reviews online we decide to visit Lydia's in the Strip.   Have you ever been ONE hour deep into waiting for your food and wished you had not ever came to a certain restaurant? No, you haven't. Probably because a sane person would know 1 hour into never seeing sight of their appetizer that they should leave.  We ordered fried calamari for appetizer and 3 entrees which consisted of lasagna, Ravioli and pork shank. After one hour, we hadn't even gotten our appetizer yet and started looking around for signs of food. Our waitress eventually saw our concerned faces and said she would check on our appetizer. After some more time of waiting, my dad finally tried to get our waitress' attention to inquire about the food. She exclaimed \"I have nfo idea, I told them and they said they are cooking it!\" When we finally got our appetizer the server kind of placed it at the end of the table and hurried away. We thought it was so odd that 1.) He did not place it in the middle of the table 2.) He didn't even make eye contact with us.  However we quickly learned why: we were appalled to see that there was 3 pieces of calamari and the rest were just tempura vegetables. Suddenly it started to make sense why it took an hour to get our appetizer? Maybe they never had any calamari?  After some more time of absurd waiting: tables around us were clearing out, other patrons were finishing their dinner and getting dessert menus...we were still sitting around twiddling our thumbs, picking at crumbs off the table.    Our food finally did make it to us but after more than an hour of waiting. We were never issued an apology. And frankly by this point all of our moods had been ruined. The whole experience made me feel a little mistreated. I hate playing the race card. But it's very hard not to when you're the only table that is an ethnic family and the only table getting mistreated. In the end, we asked for our untouched foods to be boxed and for our checks. Our waitress then informed us that the manager was kind enough to not charge us for the appetizer. At which point I insisted that it be added back to the bill. You see, my problem with this establishment isn't that I can't afford to pay for what I ordered, it's how we were treated as patrons, and in this case, patrons who do not look like the majority of the people that dine here. I would have much rather if the manager had came to our table and expressed some sort of apology.",

It was huge, which always makes me leery on the quality of the food.  We chose what is probably the most popular option - the three pasta tasting menu with unlimited top-ups.  I actually enjoyed the options, they were all diverse and different in flavor.  We also shared a salad that wasn't worth the price, in my opinion.  Overall, friendly and attentive service and decent Italian food.  Not quite what I was expecting but it served it's purpose for the night.",

The worst of all was that dinner did not come out until close to 7:45 pm and the event ended around 8 pm. I was looking forward to the pasta trio as it consisted of mushroom ravioli, shrimp fettuccine, and a fusilli. However, they only brought the pastas one at a time. I finished the ravioli and fusilli and they still had not even brought out the third pasta. The ravioli was excellent and definitely my favorite of the three. The fusilli and fettuccine were honestly both pretty lackluster and not memorable at all. We ended with the flourless chocolate cake. Overall, will most likely not be back here. As there are so many excellent restaurant options in the Burgh, I was unimpressed.",

But, we got drinks at the bar so it passed the time quickly.   The drinks were just okay, they definitely did not go shy on the alcohol, which is always a good thing. I originally ordered the Black Maple and I really did not like it. I enjoy bourbon but this was a little much. But, my friend ordered the Violet Gimlet and we ended up liking each other's drinks more so we switched and it worked out.  When we got to our table, our waitress was friendly and very attentive to us. We all got Caesar salads for our appetizers and they were tasty. I love a good Caesar salad. As for our entrees, everyone but me got the Tasting Trio. They had people walking around the restaurant constantly filling up your plate if you wanted more, which I thought was convenient. As for my dish, I ordered Pollo Al Limone which I enjoyed. It was refreshing, I enjoyed that it included spinach.  The reason I am only giving three stars is because 3 out of the 4 people I went with got sick afterwards. My boyfriend actually threw up in the middle of the night. I do not know if this was because of the food or something else. It may have been a coincidence but I am hesitant to return for this reason!",

Very knowledgeable professional and nice. The atmosphere is great. The service from the bussers to management was top notch. Sadly the food was not. Got the pasta trio. I know it changes daily but this day wasn't good. The bolognese sauce tasted like it was from a jar. My other option was a tortellini with a butter cream sauce. That sauce was non existent. 3rd option in the trio was a linguini with also a butter cream sauce! That also was non existence. The whole thing was bland. Why have two pastas with the same sauce??When I took my leftovers home I added many things . That is something I shouldn't have to do.  My husband said the salmon was ok but typical. The only positive food  item was the tiramisu!! It was the best I've ever had. So overall everything but the main courses was good. Which is sad. Not sure I will be back.  Oh and one note, always check the price of the wine that the server recommends as she of course recommended the most expensive but I knew what she was doing.",

I ordered the pasta testing trio ($23) which was very impressive, I actually love all the pastas I tried here. The Caesar salad was nice too. Haven't got chance to try the tiramisu Because I had too many pastas...hope I can taste it next time.",

    "text": "We have experienced Becco and Del Posto (one of our most favourite) in NYC. I would say Lidia's in Pitt is very similar to Becco the pasta's of the day, the fucilli pasta with meat sauce was very good and the cheese ravioli had a delicate savoury flavour. The garlic & oil pasta was way too garlicky and sometimes came with very pungent burnt garlic.  They had some interesting appetizers; tuna cruda with blood orange & avocado in a creamy oil infused with jalapeno pearls, not impressed with my small wedge of Burrata and smoked Salmon, not sure this fits with a traditional Italian menu.  Also I was not impressed with my Barolo braised rib and spaetzle. It tasted like pouched meat with absolutely no flavour and the spaetzle was drowning in oil or better again with no recognizable seasoning. I wanted to send complain but our waitress was so nice, I just left more than half in my dish and took it home. Fortunately the waiter offered me some of the pasta to taste, which filled me up. My daughter will be adding this braised meat to a savoury tomato sauce and do justice for this quality piece of meet.  Also their wines were less than impressive for the price point they are charging.  I regret not paying the $25 corking fee and bringing my own wine.  Less than impressive experience, but had to try Lidia's.",

My wife, daughter, and I stopped by on a Saturday for brunch since most other places nearby had a line. Their brunch is $29 a person and comes with unlimited buffet options from salads to breads to desserts. Then you pick an entree. We chose the pasta trio. Waiters came to our table constantly to drop off the three types of pastas. They also had coffee flowing freely into our mugs.  The experience was positive and the food decent, but nothing to write home about. We wouldn't run back.",

    "text": "We were all steaked out from eating at Ruth Chris's and decided to try Italian.  One of the folks found this place on OpenTable, so we decided to give it a try.  The space itself is beautiful.  The room has a very modern feel, even though I was told that the restaurant was 17 yrs old.  I loved the wall settings made out of cut out wine casks.  Very creative.  On to the food.  For starters, Dr. M and I got the Polipo (Grilled Octopus, Warm Potatoes, Caper, Red Onion, Gaeta Olives) and the Polpette (Heritage Pork and Beef Meatballs Braised in Tomato with Grilled Ciabatta).  These were both excellent dishes.  The word that came to mind as I was eating them was \"soft\", something the Heiress Apparent use to say as a child to describe something that was very tender.  The grilled octopus was nicely grilled and had a nice charred flavor to it.  My only complaint about the meatballs was I wish I had ordered more.  The sauce was amazing and serving them on the grilled bread was a great idea.  Although the bread was toasted, it got soggy in a good way from the sauce and the juices from the meatball.  For dinner I got the Gnocchi with Braised Duck Ragu and Dr M got the Ziti con Polpettine (Baked Ziti Pasta with Fontina, Tomato Sauce, and Meatballs).  Both these dishes were excellent.  I was surprised at the amount of duck in the ragu, very plentiful and well done.  For dessert I got the Tiramisu...pretty standard, but good.  Some of the folks at our table got the pasta trio.  Like other reviews, I would concur that while there was plenty of pasta being served, it did not have much in the way of flavor.  My friend next to me ordered this dish, so I sampled off of his plate.  There was a ravioli that was pretty good, but can't recall what was in it.  But out of the three (fettuccine, rigatoni and ravioli), the ravioli was the best.  I will say that they did keep the pasta coming out for those that ordered it.  The service was great.  Our server (Marty) was very attentive.  He gave us a history of the restaurant, told me about the back wall made out of wine casks as well as the interesting overhead lights.  We also got into a discussion about a rose cider that his girlfriend drinks...didn't even know that they made a rose cider.   Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I would have done 3.5 based on my meal.  But tasting my neighbor's pasta trio dropped it down to 3.  Our meal was definitely 3.5 stars.  They really need to spice up that pasta trio and use that red sauce that they make.  It is awesome and would make a welcome change to the trio offering.",

She was attentive, friendly, but also allowed us to enjoy our meal together. We had our son with us and appreciated that she gave us the same service as the 7 top sat shortly before us and did not act as if we were less important despite obviously having a smaller check.   The unlimited pasta was delicious and included a hollow spaghetti in a tomato and meat sauce, fettuccine with broccoli pesto and shrimp, and pear/cheese ravioli. They were all great especially for the price, but the shrimp was a bit under-seasoned. The only reason why I did not rate as 5 Stars was because overall the food was somewhat inconsistent (excellent pasta, average bread and spread, average cocktail, good dessert) in quality and price.",

This year, though, there was a special fall prix fixe menu with Winter Squash. The ravioli with balsamic drizzle were delicious. I choose quail with apples and squash for my main course and was very satisfied. Terrific glaze! The dessert, however, was over the top! Creme fraiche and pumpkin ice creams, caramel sauce, AND pumpkin fritters. We enjoyed a couple of the $28 bottles. No, they aren't stellar, but for the price they are all good food wines. Everyone in our party enjoyed the meals and we will definitely return.",

    "text": "It's funny that I went here for Sunday brunch and have yet to visit the NYC location, but se la vie.  Lidia's Pittsburgh is good.  Not spectacular, but really very good, and it's a welcome respite from the Olive Garden and the other Italian chains that seem to make up the Pgh area & the rest of the US.  Also, I give it kudos for its location in the Strip District.  Decor-wise, there is a comfortable and easy ambiance mixed with a slight artsiness that I liked.  Plus there were only friendly and helpful servers/hosts etc., which is always worth a lot, in my opinion.  While we were probably underdressed, there was zero attitude about it, and that's just not  not something I would encounter in NYC.   Again, the food was really good.  Not amazing, mind you, but very tasty.  I had the homemade pasta, which was brought tableside piping hot, in addition to the homemade salads and other fare at the buffet table.  A Bloody Mary, (or Champagne, if you prefer) is included in the brunch as well, making for a great deal!!  (I think the whole brunch was like $17 including drinks and dessert.)  The desserts were quite good as well.  This would be a great spot for a large party too.  Unfortunately, I do feel like it's missing that little something extra that makes a restaurant truly great, but it is absolutely worth a try.  You will enjoy your meal here.",

    "text": "Jeez...Has it really been a month since I've been here as I look at the receipt.  Well, I'll try to fill in the blanks.  This may be one of my new fav' brunch spots.  I'm not a fan of brunches as I detest most buffet style dining (has to do with my germophobia), sneeze guards...etc. Howeve, this is the type of brunch I can deal with.  First let's start with the space.  It's a beautiful restaurant that's been here for a few years.  Lidia of PBS fame has only three restaurants I believe (one in nyc, one in kc, and for some reason one in pgh).  As an aside I was told when I asked that one of the reasons lidia chose pittsburgh is because the ratings for her cooking show are better in this small metro than any other urban setting.  I dont' remembe all the details of the space except there were very high ceilings and ornate chandeliers (sp?).  We sat at the long bar and had a great professional bartender.  The bar offers a birds eye view into the open kitchen with many \"back of the house\" folks running about in organized confusion.  It's a bit busier today than usual Isuspect because the matriarch herself \"lidia\" is here barking orders and checking plates.  I'm told she only visits a few times a year and is here for the tomatoe dinner...Btw, Lidia in person looks very much like her profile on tv,,, she seems warm, genuine and very...how should I say...\"grandmotherlike\".  She comes out of the kitchen signs afew autographs and then has a seat by herself sipping an espresso watching the show go past...Okay, onto the food one of the main reason's I like this brunch is because the brunch entree's are cooked to order and offer some interesting options outside of your typical brunch fair.  It's relatively reasonable at $22 for everything including a \"well\" bloody mary.  The brunch starts with a delicious assortment of warm bread from the in house bakery served with three flavored butters.  I believe they are one with \"crunchy\" sugar, apricot and strawberry.  I like the crunchy one the best and quite frankly could have made a meal out of the bread and butter alone.  The buffet portion (if you will) has some fun options such as a great antipasta platter, all cheese and meats served at the perfect temperature with some house made pickles.  Also, there is a nice frittata (think italian omelette) along with a couple assorted salads and fruit.  You then have your choice of about a dozen main courses...everything from there famous pasta tasting trio for those who really want to \"carb up\" to beef tenderloin and chicken.  Annie orders this DELICIOUS duck pasta.  I don't think it's on the traditional brunch menu but it is soft pillows of al dente' pasta stuffed with a savory mix of duck and spices served in a small bowl with a dusting of cheese.  It was quite good.  I order the chicken livers, which are flavorful quick seared chicken livers, about medium rare served with polenta and fried onions.  I'm not a big polenta fan and the dish could have used some sauce, but overall it was a nice flavorful brunch.  You also get to peruse the dessert menu for the $22, but we skipped it.  We found the food quite good and the service outstanding.  Now, granted the boss was there so it was everyones \"A game\"...I don't care even without the best efforts I'm guessing this will become a somewhat regular stop for us.",

Even with a fairly packed dining room, the place wasn't too loud.  If you have any old people in your group, they can seat you downstairs as I don't think they have an elevator (I prefer being upstairs overlooking looking the dining room, it's a nice touch).  The Lobster Arancini were cooked perfectly with no crunchy, undercooked risotto inside.  The only downside was that there were just 3 (we had 4 people) and they were tiny so it was almost impossible to split them.  As for entrees, the gnocchi topped with a duck ragu are a fantastic dish, not too rich and the gnocchi simply melt in your mouth.  The Zuppa di Pesce has a wonderfully balanced broth which wasn't oversalted (a surprise given the amount of shellfish) and tasted like it might have had Sherry wine in it.  I think I counted 7 or 8 different items in this seafood hodgepodge.  As for service, it was quite good and we were done with 3 courses in a bit over an hour.  Lidia's certainly ranks up there as one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city.",

    "text": "We had a great experience at Lidia's.  I would give this a 4.5 if I could.  We started with the Prosciutto San Danielle and Asparagus and Boiled egg salad. The salad was the perfect foil to the salty prosciutto. Very nice.  We loved the bread basket with the the scoop of ground chickpeas in pesto.  We each had a salad.  My partner ordered the pasta tasting (more on this in a moment) which came with a Caesar Salad and my friend Carlos and I split the Roasted Beet salad.  For entree, I had the gnocchi with Duck ragu.  Wow.  Really fantastic.  Nice handmade gnocchi with a rich duck sauce that almost seemed like a confit.   Carlos had the grilled calamari with corona beans and escarole.  It was light and delicious in a heady broth that was spiked with Thyme.   My partner, Steven had the pasta tasting.  Kinda like Italian Rodizio, three housemade pastas of the day are served and by roving waiters with copper skillets.  They keep on serving you pasta for as long as you want to eat.  That night the pastas were a spinach and ricotta ravioli in a butter thyme sauce, pappardelle in a pulled pork sauce and Penne with eggplant.  Steven liked two out of the three.  He found the pulled pork sauce to be overwhelming.  The raviolis were a treat and when the servers brought Steven his first round, he energetically asked \"would you like to try one?\"  Of course I would!  that was indicative of all the service we encountered.  Very casual, friendly and efficient.  What more could you ask for?  Desserts were superlative.  I had the Cranberry Torta with homemade pistachio ice cream and Steven had the Panna Cotta with Marinated dry fruits.  Both were exemplary.  The decor is lovely.  All in all a great experience.  I do understand when others say that perhaps they expected a bit more, and perhaps I agree with them, considering that this is Lidia Bastianich's place, but if you dissassociate the name with the experience I think you will find that it's a great meal at a reasonable price and what's wrong with that?",

    "text": "Fine Italian dining at a reasonable price and by reasonable, I mean, it's less expensive than a Michelin  starred French restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty fancy...high ceilings, white table clothes, snooty looking hosts and waiters, however, looks are deceiving. This is a family-style restaurant, disguised as a fine dining.   We went here with 6 adults and 2 young children...arriving a little too early for dinner, they let us wait inside. I was hoping they'd give us some free appetizers, but no such luck =(. They seated us right at 5p and seats started filling up fast, so it was probably a good idea we got there early. We ordered 5 of the pasta trios and I ordered the Zuppe di Pesce (seafood stew). The pasta was good...I wouldn't say it was amazing, but definitely worth the price...$20 for just the pasta, but yo u can add a ceasar salad and desert for I think $7. For people that don't know, everyday, there are 3 different pasta dishes the chef makes for this pasta trio. They have servers for each of the individual pastas (pretty neat IMO). They give you a sampling of the 3 at first, which, quite honestly was plenty. Then you can pick one, two or even all three for the subsequent rounds. I don't know if it's all you can eat, but even the big eaters were done after their 3rd plate. There is a child's menu, but our kids eat like birds, so we asked if they could have a little of the pasta. The servers were very accomodating...bringing everyone plates to share. My wife ordered the pasta trio with a salad and desert. The ceasar was perfect (she shared it with me) and she had tiramisu that was probably the best we've ever had. The Zuppe di pesce (my entree) was AMAZING...I'm a seafood lover though. Overall, I'd say this is an upgraded version of Olive Garden...which is NOT a bad thing.",

We got there for our reservation and it took a while for anyone to come greet us at the front of the place, even though it wasn't very busy. They seated us outside, but the outdoor seating is right next to the street and it wasn't very pleasant. They were nice enough to move us inside without complaint. We ordered drinks, which took a long time to get there. I had the pasta trio special, I really liked the idea of getting to sample three different fresh recipes. I only really liked one (I know it changes up though) and only got a refill of that one. My sister got the seafood alfredo, which she said was good. I don't even remember what my parents ordered because it wasn't very memorable. Although the service was decent and the food was okay, I was just generally unimpressed and felt like we paid a lot for just a \"meh\" experience and food.",

    "text": "We joined friends for dinner at Lidia's recently and enjoyed a great italian meal.  A couple of us had the caesar salad, which wasn't anything special; it had way too much dressing on it - about what I could make at home with the bagged lettuce and bottle dressing. Our foodie friend, who frequents the restaurant regularly, chose a salad with peas, which looked delicious! I would order that next time. (I looked at their online menu and wasn't able to find the name though... sorry!)  For dinner 2 of us had the Pasta Trio which included gnocci, fettucini alfredo with mushroom and Orecchiette (\"little ears\") with sausage. I'm not a huge sausage fan but found the orecchiette to be absolutely delicious! The others were very good as well. I'm not a gnocci fan, but that was the favorite of our our italian friend who joined us.  Someone ordered the Spaghetti \"Trapanese\" with almond pesto, fried calamari and shrimp. It was outstanding! Our friend who dines here regularly said he orders it a lot.   For dessert I had the winner of the table, which was to die for! It was the \"Semifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello\" which was a square block of layered chocolate ice cream, caramel ice cream and chocolate cake. It was covered in toasted meringue and topped with crushed toffee with caramel sauce drizzled around the plate. The combination of flavors was incredible. I couldn't finish it so my friends dove in.   It's a 15 min walk or $5-6 cab fare from the Omni William Penn to the restaurant. Our friend who travels constantly to Pitt for business says that whenever he's in town for even 3 days that he goes to Lidia's at least once... and it's about a third the price of the NY locations, so if you're going to try it and are in Pgh, might as well do it here!",

    "text": "You can count on ONE hand the restaurants that serve fresh food.  Honestly.  Lidia's is one of them.  Most restaurants in our fair city order supplies from \"food service\" companies; they come frozen and ready to \"heat and serve.\"   Or they're chain restaurants with pre-packaged meals (to \"protect the 'quality' of the product\") from the central \"food factory.\"   Lidia's?  All the food is hand-made from fresh ingredients in the kitchen of the restaurant.  And under the watchful eye of Lidia herself who seems to visit Pittsburgh quite often to maintain quality control.    I adore the frico and the pasta trio offerings.  The salads are fresh and vibrant.  And the \"under $30\" wine list is a blessing.  Over the years, I've had most of what's offered on the menu and I've NEVER been disappointed by either the quality of the food or the price.  And the portions are generous.    If that's not enough, the staff -- host/hostesses, servers, bartenders, mgmt -- are first-rate: friendly, responsive and on-the-mark.  One night, my wife and I stopped by simply to have drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar and began to chat with the bartender about wine.  We ended up tasting several red wines and learning about some terrific wines priced under $20 at the state liquor store.  What a resource HE turned out to be!  My only warning: holidays can be tough at Lidia's: Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, New Year's Eve, etc.   They usually have a fixed-price menu offering those days and they tend to be overwhelmed by the number of people who come to eat there.  The service and the food quality suffers as a result.  My advice?  Avoid the holidays and stop by on a weeknight for a dinner experience unlike you've ever had.   Linger and enjoy the desserts.  Soak in the atmosphere.  Chat with the staff.    Still the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  No doubt about it.",

I had two family members visiting from out of town, and they wanted to eat dinner here after having seen Lidia on TV for years.  I had no prior experience with the restaurant, and I don't intend to return.  The waitress told us she'd been there for 11 years, but it seemed like her first night on the job.  She tipped over a wine glass while pouring red wine, covering the table in wine, and nearly got it all over us.  Thank goodness we had already put napkins on our laps.  It took 90 minutes to get our food, by which time I was desperate to eat anything, not having eaten since breakfast.  The neighboring table had been seated, served drinks, and finished their food before we got our meals.  My steak, which was supposed to be medium rare, came out medium well.  The broccolini that went with it was so overcooked as to be mush.  I would have sent it back had I not been so hungry at that point.  My husband got a teensy portion of gnocchi that he finished instantly, since we'd been waiting for food for so long.  My two family members could not finish their meals, as they were so bad.  Total disaster, and I was embarrassed to have taken guests there.",

    "text": "One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Four of us sat with our winter coats on because it was so cold and cold air was blowing on us (even though the weather outside was in the 30s). The people at the table next to us had their coats on as well. I asked the server why it was so cold and got no clear answer. Our food eventually came and it was also cold -- the pasta, the sides, even the broccoli, were cold. One of the side dishes was warm, but nothing was hot when served.  I asked to speak with the manager several times since we were so cold. After asking someone for the 3rd time to speak with the manager, he finally came over. He (Eric) never asked us what was wrong, he just immediately launched into a story that the thermostat was set on 74, and he moved it up to 76, so that is all that he can do. I told him that the thermostat setting didn't matter if cold air was blowing on us and we were freezing. He insisted he knows how HVAC works, and that it is essentially my problem if I am not warm enough when the thermostat is set on 76. I also told him the food was cold and he just ignored that completely. His overall reaction and response was the rudest encounter that I've ever had in a restaurant. I now know why we were able to get a last minute reservation there on a Saturday night during prime dining time.  I've eaten at Lidia's in the past and the experience was fine, but that was about 2 years ago. The server was nice and was also saying that she could feel the cold air blowing at our table, but she seemed to be afraid of the manager. We paid the check (which was not cheap) and left. We didn't even take the food or the desserts that we prepaid for. We just wanted to go home and get warm.",

The appetizers were okay, but it was nothing special. There were 6 of us and the portions seemed somewhat small. I ordered the lamb, which was seasoned well. Desserts were okay as well, but also tasted just like something you could buy at Giant Eagle. Despite it being such a limited menu and set process, our waiter was hardly around. He rarely checked in our table and brunch took over two hours due to this fact. I would consider coming back here for a regular dinner, but definitely not for a special event.",

    "text": "Had dinner at Lidia's last Thursday night, and my wife and I are still shaking our heads about possibly the worst fine dining experience we've had.  Over the years, we've never had issues with Lidia's and have always thought it to be a good and classy restaurant - not any more.  We were they for about 100 minutes, and I think we were waiting for something for at least an hour. It also appeared that the \"A team\" of employees were at the Steeler's game, as the staff was nowhere near the classy and competent crew that we would expect at a restaurant of this caliber.   The experience started out when my wife ordered a Sparkling Rose' whilst waiting for me. The first glass was flat, and there was not another chilled bottle in the cooler, really?  He tried to chill the glass but the result was not good.  So, we were seated in the dining room at a table that was so wobbly we were afraid to move - nobody noticed this while bussing earlier. Fortunately, the one shining star of the staff that night fixed it in a jiffy. With our table secured, I noticed that my water glass had a speck of food on it, but I was able to swap it with another one on the table - no big deal or so I thought. We ordered a bottle of wine and a happy hour appetizer. It was not on the dinner menu and our waitress did find a way to get it for us, although it took several trips. Next, the bread basket and dips were literally dropped on our table with zero explanation of what was in the basket or dips.  Wine glasses were delivered, and mine was dirty, again. It was replaced and our appetizer arrived, but no wine.  We are now going on about 20 minutes with no wine or waitress. I finally corralled her and inquired about our wine. She had to go check and came back with the old \"we are out of that one\", and said that the manager/sommelier would come out to help us select a replacement.  More time, no wine. She came with a bottle about half the price of the one we ordered and asked if it would be acceptable. It was good but not the quality that we were seeking. Finally, the \"sommelier\" arrived with 2 options. I did mention that we were a bit frustrated after sitting at our table for over 30 minutes with not wine.  He did choose a suitable replacement. We saw him one more time to refill my glass, not my wife's, and that was it! Fortunately, the food did not arrive until after we got our wine and finished our app which was quite tasty.  Dinner, not so much. I had the baked ziti and meatballs, and it was terribly underwhelming.  The pasta was over cooked, the sauce was way too plentiful, extremely salty, and a bit burnt, about the quality I'd expect from the local family Italian restaurant. Then, there were the meatballs. I thought they tasted ok until I had huge, tooth-sized, pieces of gristle in 2 of the 3 meatballs I ate, and that was the last meatball for me.  My wife had the lasagna with Bolognese, and it was by far the better dish although the sauce was bland and a bit too creamy. The waitress was very apologetic and offered a free dessert for our troubles. We accepted and took it to go, and it was not great either.  Needless to say, this experience did not sit well, and we will not be returning. This may have been an isolated incident, but it doesn't matter in today's Pittsburgh dinner scene as there are so many other, and apparently better options for my $125!",

I ended up taking if off of the panini, and then it tasted much better.  The pesto and bread were great so why use salty chicken?  The bread that came with the meal was good, but the soup was a letdown as well.  The atmosphere is really nice, though.  It's a tablecloths and cloth napkins kind of place, and most people were in for business lunches.  The servers were good, and it's a classy vibe.  Overall, after reading Yelp reviews, I would only come back here for the brunch or pasta trio.  Otherwise, there are cheaper and better options for lunch.",

Started off with a great Caesar's salad (Insalata \"Cesare\" alla Lidia), followed by three pasta dishes, and ended with an interesting choice for dessert.    The pastas were right out of the kitchen - the farfalle with fennel, caramelized onions, sausage, and some tomatoes, was fantastic.  The gnocchi were great, and the linguine with basil pasta and shrimp was good but not on par with the other two pastas.    The dessert was an olive oil and basil torte with lemon ice cream (my description doesn't adequately describe it) - I should've written down the description from the menu, although I did upload a photo of the dessert.  The wait staff was outstanding - attentive without being intrusive.  The decor is awesome - especially the backlit wall with wine bottles.    I hope to be in Pittsburgh again very soon and will definitely go back to Lidia's.",

    "text": "My dearest Lidia,  Hello! How are you? How's Manhattan? Is PBS treating you well? Is your wallet getting fatter by the second? I hope so.   I finally dropped by your restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District this evening. I know you've been begging me to check it out for years, but quite frankly, I just haven't been in the mood for pasta. You know how I am... carbs and all.   You know, I must give you props for the restaurant's layout. The fancy wall art, the color of the paint... I must say Rockwell did a very good job, and watching the sun set over the Allegheny River while dining on our meal was simply delightful.   At the behest of our server, each of my dining companions and I ordered the prix fixe pasta and a few antipasti. The antipasti were lovely - the lightly seasoned calamari was divine and the fresh mozzarella and olive platter was splendid. A terrific way to start the meal.  Now Lidia, I know you'll never indulge me, but what on earth is in the dressing on your Caesar salad? It's smashing! There's definitely a hint of pear in it, but other than that, I'm flummoxed. Oh, and the imported cheese really bolstered the salad, sending a usually ho-hum affair into the stratosphere. You've really outdone yourself, my dear.   And then came the prix fixe pasta trio. Lidia, darling, you know I'm a fan, but it really wasn't your best effort. The imported eggplant was overpowered by the tomato sauce, and the broccoli and sausage rabe was good but not great. Only the goat cheese-stuffed ravioli was better than average, but just marginally. Our server informed us that the ravioli was infused with thyme, but spank my bottom if I didn't taste a thing! Over all, not your best showing.   Dessert was quite sterling - the strawberry panna cotta was perfectly prepared, although a bit much with the cookies. Really, who has room for all that. I know you chide me constantly with your incessant \"mangia, Joe, mangia!\", but I had really eaten far too much and the champagne had gone to my head as well.   So there you have it: my visit to your restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not quite five stars, but certainly not 3 stars. I'll give you a four this time, if only for the blandness of the prix fixe. Do give my love to Joseph and don't be a stranger. We haven't chatted on Skype in ages!  Kisses, Joe",

Just outside of downtown Pittsburgh (by Wholey's and The Heinz History Museum), this restaurant has soaring ceilings, a beautiful Chihuly-style glass chandelier, and friendly waitstaff. It's great for a date night, business lunch/dinner, or celebratory dinner (we've celebrated new jobs, birthdays, and anniversaries here over the years). It was started by famous chef Lidia Bastianich and features a wonderful selection of pastas, wines, and desserts. The meal always starts with a bread basket filled with crunchy cheese bread sticks (they taste like gourmet Cheez-Its), herbed foccacia, and Italian bread and the breads are served alongside two different \"butters\" (olive and pesto, I believe). There are some amazing dishes on the menu (my mom loves their gnocchi with duck ragu and the arugula salad and rarely gets anything else, while my dad and brother are more willing to try different things from the menu, like wild boar ravioli or caprese salad), but the best choice on the menu by far is Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio. Offered either on its own or paired with a Caesar salad and choice of dessert, this meal consists of endless servings of three different, freshly made pastas. The pastas and their sauces change each day, but you can usually count on at least one butter-based sauce (usually butter and sage or butter and thyme) and one tomato-based sauce. The pastas are always different--last night, they had bucatini, papardelle, and ravioli--and they are always freshly made. The servers bring out steaming saute pans filled with the fresh pasta and you can eat as much pasta as you want (the servers will stop by every so often to offer another serving). This meal is a great way to try new types of pastas and new sauces and, with three types served each time, you're bound to like one. I've had spinach and ricotta ravioli, tagliatelle in a thyme-butter sauce, linguine in a creamy tomato sauce, bucatini in a spicy tomato sauce with caramelized onions and bacon...I've had too many pastas and sauces to count and I've always enjoyed this meal. I highly recommend getting it with the salad and dessert--the Caesar salad is lovely and they usually have some tasty desserts. They always offer delicious ice creams and sorbets (we've had lemon sorbet, olive oil ice cream, chocolate espresso ice cream, and strawberry sorbet, to name a few) and they usually have some sort of decadent chocolate dessert available.  The restaurant is definitely dressy, but there's always the one table with the idiots who came dressed in jeans and a tee shirt--please don't be one of those idiots (wear a cute dress or khakis and a polo). They offer valet parking, but there's a large, relatively inexpensive parking lot right across the street. Reservations help, but usually you can get in without one (unless it's a weekend evening). I recommend coming in with an empty stomach, because with all of that pasta, you'll need some room in there.",

    "text": "Arriving at the midpoint of the lunch hour we were surprised to find the restaurant less than 1/4 full.  With the bar empty and only one section being seated be claimed our reservation and were led quickly to a table near the large glass windows - an excellent view of the river would be our companion throughout the meal.  Meeting our waiter, a friendly man named Chendo we were given menus and a brief explanation of the daily special pastas for the Pasta Trio.  With the restaurant quite slow that day I will note we were very well taken care of throughout out meal - the service staff was excellent.  Browsing the high ceilinged room, randomly placed bottles and objects, and abundant brightly colored glass panels plus Chihuily influenced chandeliers I have to say Lidia's is a very handsome restaurant - it has that \"wow\" factor of many New York City dining rooms.  While the white paper over white tablecloth aspect of the table setting struck me as odd, everything else felt \"fine dining\" without seeming forced.  Sitting and waiting for our meals to arrive we were first delivered one of the better bread baskets I've had in recent memory - Sea Salt Foccacia, Rustic Italian, and Cracked Wheat Sourdough served with two spreads, a Chick Pea Pesto and pureed White Beans with Black Olive, both resting in a pool of slightly sweet extra virgin olive oil.  Served warm the breads were tantalizing and given the size of the portions soon to be arriving it was definitely a chore not to overindulge (a chore I failed, miserably.)  For our main courses my mother opted for a salad and a contorti while Erika and I chose pastas.  For myselfthe choice was quite simple - my favorite pasta and my favorite protein on the same plate, Gnocchi with Duck Guazetto.  An Italian Stew not unlike Chicken Cacciatore, but featuring duck in white wine instead of Chicken in Red the thick reduction was hearty, meaty, smoky, and laden with vegetables.  Paired with a toothsome yet non-doughy potato gnocchi the dish was not only enormous, but incredibly filling.  While I will admit I ate a lot of bread and helped my mother and sister  with their plates I can say that this was one dish I couldn't finish, it was just too large.  For Mother's selection she opted for the Roasted Beet and Apple Salad with Frisee and Fresh Goat Cheese plus the Pan Seared Golden Polenta Fritters.  A competent salad with sweet apples balancing earthy beets and pungent goat cheese the dish was brought together by a splash of balsamic and olive oil, ample in size and flavor, very nicely done.  Not fairing quite as well as the Salad were the Fritters - nicely prepared and crispy on the outside with creamy polenta within, they simply lacked flavor.  Erika's selection would be the signature Pasta Trio - three pastas plated tableside with unlimited refills.  Admittedly the concept sounds somewhat \"Olive Garden\" but that is before you realize two of the pastas are made in house and one is imported direct from Italy...and all the sauces are made daily in the kitchen, as well.  Served up onto a single large platter the daily selections  would be hand torn Tagliatelle and Pork Ragu, Imported Orchiette with Fennel Sausage and Thyme, and house folded Sweet Pea and Corn Ravioli with Cream Sauce.  Enormous in portion I cannot really fathom anyone requiring seconds of the trio and at a mere $14 the selections were excellent.  Smoky and Sweet the Pork Ragu complimented the al dente Tagliatelle nicely while the aromatic sausage was an equally balanced flavor for the Orchiette.  The most impressive of the group, the sweet pea and corn ravioli, was sweetened only by the vegetal components while the cream itself had notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Arriving simultaneously and thankfully smaller than the entrees was Torta di Mandorle e Mirtilli - Blueberry and almond cake, blueberry-lavender ice cream, almond crunch, blueberries. .  If a little is good a lot is better seemed to be the theme of this dessert and it worked nicely - the fresh blueberries lacing the buttery pound cake, the flowery accent to the blueberry ice cream, and the crunchy sugared almonds paired with even more blueberries - excellent.  The second dessert, larger in size but lighter in texture, would be Panna Cotta alla Fragola - Strawberry and ricotta panna cottas, lemon-strawberry sandwich cookies, fresh strawberries.  Served in a 12oz glass better suited for a milkshake the panna cotta was surprisingly springy and well blended with a more gelatin strawberry base topped by an ample creamy layer of whipped cream and ricotta.  Unnecessary but welcomed the lemony cookies were much akin to a shortbread in texture and Madeline in flavor.  Having heard \"upscale Olive Garden\" comparisons I personally find that assessment far from accurate and would actually go so far as to say that aside from the lack of seasoning the the experience was on par with many fine dining Italian establishments in other cities.",

    "text": "Had dinner here with my wife and another couple.  The food was good, as we have expected from a previous visit.  The service was OK. The restaurant was maybe half full on a Monday night.  We were passed from one server to another, even though the first server was still working.  In addition, the explanation of the 3-course special was incomplete, so it was not clear what was included or what choices were possible, but we did get all that should have been included. We also had a hard time getting attention for basic service items, like more cheese for the one person who ordered the pasta tasting trio, or the second glass of wine for the special.   In the end, we could not finish it all and asked for it to be boxed up. Three of us got our remainders boxes, but they apparently didn't box up the half of the secondi from my wife, who was really looking forward to finishing it the next night. We didn't notice until the next morning that they left out one of the take home boxes.  Maybe the staff was just having an off night, but it will negatively effect my decision for a repeat visit.  Summary: good, but the service was a bit disappointing for this level of restaurant.",

    "text": "Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own Italian cooking show? Should be great, right? Not so much.  Went here recently and ordered the pasta trio, since this is apparently what one gets at Lidias. Perhaps I went on the wrong day, but I thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce, pesto sauce, and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. At the very least, there are Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.  The one positive to Lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. I had a bite of a chocolate torte, and was very impressed. The coffee with grappa was also quite nice.  All things told, though, I would spend my money elsewhere.",

While we had been to Lidia's once before for a wine tasting, we had never eaten there.  As an appetizer, we shared a delicious Fritto Misto with housemade sausage and apple.  Before we ordered it, we were slightly worried that they apple may be too much, but it actually gave a nice balance to the dish.  For our entrees, my wife ordered the gnocchi with braised duck ragout while I opted for the Osso Bucco di Maiale.  I was happy with but not blown away by the Osso Bucco.  It was a huge portion and we ended up taking some home with us.  My wife loved the gnocchi though, so next time I will order a pasta for my entree.  The wine list is extensive and we shared a wonderful bottle of Chianti that was on a special Valentine's Day wine list.    Lidia's is definitely a great romantic date place and will be on our list to visit again soon.",

He looked at me like I was crazy when I opted to take the bloody mary instead of continue to nurse my  2-day hangover.  Our waitress was robotic and efficient.  After ordering the pasta sampler as my entree, I loaded a small plate of munchies at the antipasti table.  My favorite?  The ceasar salad.  Big fat lettuce leaves coated with fresh dressing and imported, shredded cheese.  A staple food really well done.  Then as my buddy's meal came, a bare plate was set in front of me, and 30 seconds later a nice man approached my table and scooped pasta directly out of a skillet onto my plate.  It happened twice more, in quick succession.  I was left with an arrabiata fetticuine noodle (light and obviously made fresh in the kitch), a handful of asparagus-pea ravioli in a buttery sauce, and a heavy orchettie with sausage.  All three were exceptionally yummy, though when I was finished with the meal, there was a decent amount of sausage pasta left on my plate.  I would definitely eat here again, but for the price, not on a regular basis.",

    "text": "The restaurant's atmosphere and decor is very nice - open and spacious with some very lovely fixtures.  There were three of us at our table, and we ordered caesar salads, lasagna and manicotti, which we requested to have with meat sauce, rather than with the traditional tomato.  One of us also ordered a glass of the house chianti.    The bread and spreads were very good - particularly the herbed bread and the garbanzo bean spread.  Likewise, the caesar salads were nice - the dressing had a nice lemony tang, and they were generous with the cheese and croutons.  The main courses themselves were a disaster.  Bland, bland, bland - and of course, Lidia's is the kind of place that doesn't put salt shakers on the table.  The lasagna with spinach noodles was soft and mushy, with very little actual cheese.  And the manicotti was watery and flavorless.  As for the house chianti, the person who ordered it sent it back - something he's never done before - because he was astounded by how raw and medicinal it was.    We might have done better with the Pasta Trio, but upon hearing what the featured pastas were, none of them sounded even remotely appealing.   I appreciate what Lidia's is trying to do with their menu, but as an Italian restaurant (and not a cheap one, either - they charged us an extra $3 for the bolognese sauce vs. the plain tomato), they ought to get the basics right first.  A good meat sauce and decent lasagna shouldn't be too much to ask.    We won't be back!",

The soaring funky renovated warehouse was packed with couples on date nights, multigenerational families, Steelers and Pirates fans, and parents with their college kids.  We really enjoyed the lively ambience, friendly and efficient service, and most of all, the delicious food! The kitchen accommodated our vegan request with a pasta and vegetable orrichete. The past flight--unlimited servings of three incredible fresh pastas served table side with Caesar salad and dessert for $35--was the hit! We also enjoyed a wonderful lemon chicken and the lamb chops were perfect! I reluctantly admitted that the tiramisu was even better than mine. The wine list was terrific as well and our waiter advised my mom on a selection that went well with her entree. There was a slight lag in service due to a party of 12 near us, but it's hard to complain about such a lovely dinner experience with family!",

The Pasta Trio is a sample of three different pasta dishes the chef creates each evening.  After tasting the three dishes you decide how many more portions you have of either or all dishes.  The three were very good, but I had a second portion of only one.  Desserts are fabulous and I mean each and every one.  There were seven in my party and every person raved about the desserts.  I would have given Lidia's 5 Stars, however, the server dropped some pasta into the pan while he was serving us and a few drops of the olive oil splashed out onto another diner's shirt and onto my pants.  The server's response to the accident was \"Sorry Guys.\"  Would I go back? Most definitely!  Lidia I hope you open up a restaurant out here in CA!",

You have a whole antipasti table, full-sized entree and a dessert table plus coffee+bloodymary or mimosa. All under $25. And that IS a lot of food! I took my boyfriend there, and this boy eats a lot! He was full and couldn't even get to dessert. (Well yea he is a boy and may be not that into sweets, but still). The flavors of the food are really good and satisfying. I truly recommend the chicken dish on the brunch menu, the grilled octopus and the gnocchi (which not being a pasta fan, I savored). I hear the pasta is really good too!  Also a great place to take company or out-of-towners too!",

    "text": "I have been to all of Lidia's restaurants in Manhattan, but this was my first go at her establishment all the way out in Pittsburgh.  This restaurant is pretty similar to Becco, except there is no \"theater crowd\" and the restaurant has a considerable amount of space.  The menus are pretty similar too, with the unlimited pasta specials being a mainstay here as well.    The design of the restaurant is intriguing.  It has two levels, and a considerable amount of open air space which is punctuated with huge, intricate chandeliers and giant tableaux along the walls.  There is an industrial feel which helps the restaurant blend in fairly well with the Strip District; yet, at the same time, there is a sense of elegance down along the floor.  The balance was struck quite nicely, and it made for an interesting place to eat.    As for dinner, I was disappointed that the 3-course prix-fixe was only available as an option for the entire table.  My girlfriend did not want to eat any pasta, so that option was simply not available to me.  I am not sure why they can't offer the special on an individual basis and charge a \"single supplement\" price if only one person orders it from a particular table, especially if we were both planning to eat 3 courses anyway.  I ended up ordering the same appetizer I would have ordered from the 3-course menu, a pasta dish for my second course, and forwent dessert for the same price.  It seems silly to be so pedantic about such things.  Oh well.   For the appetizer, I went with the Cozze ($12).  As an appetizer, it is only available in a white wine preparation, but on the prix-fixe menu they had a red wine (fra diavolo) preparation.  Since that menu was verboten to me, you guessed it, I received the white wine preparation.  The mussels were served in a very narrow, tall bowl.  The bowl was jammed tight with open black mussels, sitting upon a shallow pool of broth and crowned by two pieces of toast.  The mussels were clean, not a single one was cracked, and they were all open boasting sizable pieces of meat.  I had to eat about half of them though before I could get to the broth, and given the narrow opening of the bowl, I had to break the toast into pieces to sop up some of the broth at the end.  The broth was silky smooth and fairly flavorful.  I just wish it were more accessible.  The presentation was aesthetically pleasing, but not especially functional.  For the main course, I went with the Lasagna Bolognese ($16).  I was so pleased to see an authentic preparation!  There were flat sheets of freshly made spinach pasta which had the perfect texture for this dish.  The color of the sauce was correct too for a dish from Bologna.  The quality of the Grana Padano was pretty good as well.  The portion size was especially large making for a rather robust and tasty dish.  I was fairly pleased with this course, good all around.  Wine.  I had a glass of Nero d'Avola ($10).  The particular selection was decent.  I was surprised though that my wine glass was taken from the table and later appeared on the table with wine in it.  What was this?  Why was I not shown the bottle?  Why was I not given an option to taste it?  (It's an inexpensive wine; I can live with that one).  Why was it not poured in front of me?  And, why was it under-poured?  So, yeah, I was pretty much not inclined to have any more wine, given such off-putting service.    I passed on dessert and called it a night.  Overall, I think the quality of the dishes is high, and I generally enjoyed the ambiance.  They are missing all of the polished service that I would expect to see at any of the NY locations, though.  Also, I was annoyed with the structure of the menu.    3.75 stars",

Prices are a little high for Pittsburgh. The servers have always suggested the Pasta Trio, which my wife had.  Each of the three smelled fabulous. She enjoyed each, having a second helping of only one of the three, because they give you enough on the first go around.  With celiac disease, I was very happy to see they've added gluten free pasta to their menu.  I had their house made corn pasta ravioli filled with pumpkin & cheese in a brown butter sauce.

He also rinsed and let me keep the sweet GLASS cork from bottle of red wine I selected. (It was the Nero d'Avola, btw). Not a bad wine, tasted better once we were actually eating.

    "text": "I had a great lunch here!  The service, TBH, was average, but they pre-bused the hell out of my table so I was incredibly delighted! (Lack of pre-bus is a HUUUUUGE pet peeve of mine!)  There were several items on the menu that I really wanted to try and I was truly torn on what to get. There was a Wild Boar dish, a Salmon that sounded amazing, and a Duck dish that sounded awesome, too!  I'll walk you through the meal...  1.)  They bring you some delicious breads (a Rosemary and Sea Salt bread, and another plainer Italian bread) to dip into a plate that had 2 perfectly rounded scoops of spreads in a pool of olive oil. The scoops?  I think that one was an avocado-based spread and the other, I think, was a black bean spread--neither of them were overly flavorful, but both were relatively light and fresh. **My Faves Here:  Sea Salt & Rosemary Bread with the [Black Bean] Spread  2.)  Next was salad: You can choose a Caesar salad or a pickier/plane salad (but the plane salad will take extra time to make because the servers prep the salads themselves--so it was explained to us, anyhow). The Caesar was good!  The anchovies are diced into the dressing, but you can barely recognize them if you're not a fan of anchovies and are worried about that. I honestly wouldn't have even known they were in there, had I not asked! **My Faves Here: Go for the Ceasar; it was great!  3.)  For an appetizer (this is a weird choice, but I'm happy we did it), we got the \"Chef's Vegetarian Sampler\".  This included a delicious, and lightly spicy, Barley Risotto, some Sauteed Spinach, and some type of [fried] Potato dish.  It was very good! **My Faves Here:  The Potatoes were pretty addicting! **Least Faves Here:  The sauteed spinach--very garlicy!  4.)  I ended up choosing \"Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio\"--and I would recommend that to others who find themselves torn between several things. Here's how this works... There are 3 pastas \"of the day\". The servers bring around large bowls of all three types of pasta and places all three types on your plate for you to try. One you've sampled all three, its \"all you can eat\" of your faves. They'll ask you what types you'd like more of and give you more. Not a bad deal!  The day that I went, all three were pretty good. One had a spicy, red sauce and wide noodles. Another had an olive oil based sauce and had Orecchiette pasta. The last one was the one that I could have eaten allllllll day! It was simple, but amazing! Goat Cheese filled Ravioli with a Butter and Thyme sauce!  Ugh... to die for!  Let me tell you about this ravioli! They were not \"doughey\" at all; they were perfect! Very thin pasta, but none were broken! Delicate and perfectly filled with the most amazing cheese. The butter/thyme sauce wasn't the least bit overwhelming! It was the perfect compliment to this dish! ...just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Lidia's NOW! **My Faves Here:  OBVIOUSLY the Goat Cheese Ravioli! **My Least Fave:  The Orcchiette dish.  It wasn't \"bad\", it was just \"meh\".  5.)  Oh, yes... there WAS dessert, too!  ;) (don't judge me!  lots of folks have dessert at lunch-time!)  ;) I enjoyed the Tiramisu! Now, some people like it when the lady fingers in Tiramisu are very Rummy tasting, but I am not a fan of too much of that! This was perfect and delicious! I would def recommend it!  All in all... Lidia's = WIN!  PROS:   Delicious; Pre-bus galore!  CONS: Parking (but you can park in the \"dust bowl\" across the street. Located in the strip Pretty busy on the weekends!",

Servers were friendly and did not push us out after we paid our bill, which was nice.  Bring your appetite!! Highlights: The OJ in the Mimosa was fresh The rosemary and sea salt bread with sugar butter Lemon scone with sugar butter, and apricot and strawberry  butter Fried cauliflower from the antipasto table My main entree - grilled octopus w/ potatoes, onions, string beans, olives, pickled onions - salty which I loved and the octopus was tender and cooked well The pistachio and ginger mini cookies were my favorite Coffee brewed well  The other items were just okay so while there were some standouts Lidia's brunch was more quantity verse quality given the wide spread available.  You will not leave hungry and if you do you did Lidia's wrong!  Also they will break out checks separately.",

Our antipasti were largely bland and uninspired.  The chicken livers were the best of the lot, though the crispy onions that were piled over top were in desperate need of salt. Our main dishes were equally mediocre.  The wild boar ravioli tasted fine, but the presentation was seriously lacking.  The gnocchi were fine ...but after a few bites, they lost their appeal.  The duck breast was under done. And the wine by the glass was a stingy pour given the cost. All of that could be forgiven ...but the waitstaff performance could not.  The waiter for an adjacent table spun around and slammed into the back of my husband's head ...without a word of apology.  Another parked a tray of food for another table in the aisle blocking another member of our party from returning to his seat, without any sort of acknowledgement when he finally returned to move it.  Our waiter was at least pleasant enough, but clearly uninformed about the food he was serving.  He should at least know how to pronounce \"thyme\".",

It was a on a Wednesday night, but there shouldn't be an excuse for a meal this expensive.  First dish was grilled octopus, which was great.  I thought it needed more seasoning on the meat, but the accompanying salad was perfectly dressed.  My gnocchi I felt wasn't fresh, however the rabbit ragu was really nice.  Again, though, it needed more seasoning.  I actually wondered if they were catering to an old Pittsburgh clientele who may not put salt on their food.  My dinner partner had calimari and shrimp over pasta, and it was too al dente.",

Try out the goat cheese with a tiny bit citrus and an apple. Ahh their a h'orderves  are marvelous. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back.  Their restaurant is beautiful. They have taken the typical Pittsburgh high ceilings and spiced them up with some beautiful hand-blown glass lights. Look up! Oh and the large windows open it up just the perfect amount.  Okay, so I don't technically know if the glass was hand blown, but I like to think so.",

    "text": "Each experience I've had at Lidia's was positive.  I've visited the restaurant several times, but mostly for lunch or brunch.  The food is delicious and well prepared, though it can be a bit pricey.  I've visited Lidia's most frequently for brunch, and find the value to be top-notch.  For $25, you have a large antipasti table selection, your choice of entree, a generous dessert table selection, and complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Other restaurants of this caliber would charge separately for all this food, putting the total bill far higher.  The foods are fresh and reflect a wide variety of Italian foods, not necessarily the same foods you would find at your corner Italian restaurant featuring spaghetti and lasagna.    The food is good, but perhaps doesn't quite meet the high expectations people have before their first visit.  Letting go of the unnatural expectation that every bite of food you eat from a celebrity chef restaurant will be life-changing, you will have a pleasant and positive experience at Lidia's.    When we excitedly told the wait staff we were celebrating my birthday with them, they brought me a complimentary flour-less chocolate cake which was absolutely incredible.  The service at Lidia's is incomparable, always making you feel like the king or queen of the room.     I would recommend Lidia's to anyone looking for a quality Italian lunch or dinner with an upscale atmosphere.  This restaurant would be great for dates and special occasions.",

We shared their Caesar salad...a favorite  they say and done very well..great favors in the dressing.  My only ding is that they slightly over dressed the lettuce for my liking.  Then my husband and I both ordered the pasta trio...on this day they served a potato leek ravioli, a basil parmesan tagliatelle and a sausage, fennel rigatoni.  All were very good however, both of us liked the rigatoni best...with lots of flavors in the meat sauce.  We also enjoy wine with our pasta a nice bottle of white wine but for an upscale Italian restaurant the quality of the wine glasses was mediocre and thus swayed us toward a lower cost wine.",

    "text": "Wow, should have listened to the recent Yelp reviews, but always wanted to try this restaurant because I've been a fan of Lidia's, growing up on her PBS  TV show.   Had reservations for a Sunday night at 7 pm and when I called to make them, the hostess asked if there were any celebrations. I told her my nephew and SIL were both celebrating birthdays on that day. She then informed me that they could either order desserts from the menu or if they didn't pick one, then they would chose one, both instances complimentary. I thought that was a very nice touch.   Got there around 6:50 and a few people were waiting. Informed the hostess we had reservations and she said we would be seated momentarily. There were 7 of us. Her definition and mine of \" \"momentarily\" must be different, as we didn't get seated until 7:25; even though half the restaurant was empty. That's already leaving a bad taste in my mouth. There were plenty of tables available.   In our group, three people ordered the pasta trio, deluxe, I had the Sunday special, son ordered eggplant parmigiana, hubby had the chicken lemone, and SIL, the Osso Busso. Also had 2 bottles of wine. Oh, and salads aren't included in the meals and are quite pricy. $10 for a plain green salad with no olives, just a few chopped up tomatoes and onions.   Server brought salads, and had to ask if he could please bring out the bread basket. Said it was in the oven. Finally he brought it out and unlike the pictures posted, contents looked nothing like them. One small breadbasket consisting of a few breadsticks and small pieces of what I think is their focciacia bread, along with some small crumbly things, no Italian bread slices and it was served cold. So much \"for it being in the oven.\"  Was expecting it to be at least warm, especially from a restaurant with these prices. Looked like they rounded up the scraps from the other diners's basket.   A few meals were okay, son received only two pieces of eggplant, unlike the three shown on yelp photos, and he was still hungry. SIL hated  her Osso Bucco, hardly ate any of it, yet the waiter never asked if it was ok. Seeing most of the meal left  on her plate, you'd think he would have asked if there was a problem. My Sunday supper special and husband's chicken lemone were ok, nothing special. We've definitely had better at other restaurants.   In addition to these overpriced meals being mediocre, what really lacked was attention from the server. He brought the entrees over and left the salad plates on the table. Had to ask him to remove them. Had to ask him repeatedly for more bread, hoping we would get a better selection.  I don't know if he was new or what the problem was, but we have had better service at a Denny's.   And, the most disappointing part of the evening?  No mention of the two birthdays being  celebrated and acknowledged. No complimentary birthday desserts for them as we were promised. No \"happy birthday\" written on desserts plates, nothing. So much for wanting to surprise my family. My husband brought it to the waiter's  attention and his reply? \"Oh, no one told me.\"   No one came around the entire night and asked how our meals were either.   Two separate checks were presented and they were wrong. Having items on it that we didn't order and/or were on the wrong check.   What really made me upset is that we expected a nice evening out, celebrating my family's birthdays and this \"fine dining\" experience was anything but.   Ironically husband and I ate at a small Italian restaurant in Wexford the night before, and on several occasions,   the owner and manager and waitress came over, asking how our meals were. Their bread was plentiful and served warm. Their waitress didn't leave dirty dishes on the table. She frequently checked back with us. And it was more than half of what we paid at Lidias.   That's the difference between a great Italian restaurant and one surviving on their brand name. Lidia needs to be taking more of an active interest in her restaurant because not only the food, but the service is sub par. And, no, we won't be returning here. Ever.",

When you walk in there are tables everywhere, but mainly for 4 or more.  If you are a party of two, you are seated right next to, or very near the waitstaff station, which means there are people constantly walking past your table.    Our table was right across from the waitstaff station so we were met with looking at waitstaff's bottoms all night, and our conversations were interrupted with the noise of dishes, glasses and waitstaff complaining about customers.  Instead of having a nice romantic dinner, we had a dinner where we could not really have a conversation.  It's almost as if parties of two are being punished as this is an absolutely horrible place to sit, completely ruins the dinner.   The food is decent, not as good as we had hoped.  My husband had stuffed cabbage, it was pretty good.  I had salmon and it was pretty salty. During dinner our waitress asked if I would like another glass of wine, I said yes, and I never received it.  When we asked for our check she said, \"you didn't want another glass of wine did you?\"  Obviously she remembered at that point and tried to cover.  I think she forgot as she was dealing with a problem at another table, we heard the whole conversation as she complained to another waiter.  This was a place we were looking forward to visiting on our visit to Pittsburgh, but unfortunately it was a disappointment.",

    "text": "This was our first time here. It was for my mom's bday. She always wanted to try it. we were a table of 10 (3 kids)  on a Saturday we had a reservation. the staff was very friendly and the place was packed. let me say my family is Italian American so we don't normally eat Italian when we eat out. The octopus appetizer was good. everyone who got the house salad with their meal all said the same thing the dressing was bland. I got the Caesar Salad with my dinner and it was good. I had the Gnoochi with Duck Ragu, I should have take an picture to show how small the portion was. The Gnoochi were nothing to brag about I've had better. The braised duck sauce was good I will say but the portion was laughable at $20.  It was literally slopped on a plain white plate. Normally I can't eat a lot of gnoochi but this portion size I was able to so it was really small. My sister got the pasta trio, for homemade pasta and none of us were that impressed. It was just ok. My husband had the meatball app and the pork chop. The meatballs were not good and the pork chop looked like it was just covered with red sauce and mozzarella, what is that? I never get red sauce when I go out I make it so much that I am always underwhelmed. My two youngest kids got the spaghetti and meatballs and said it was like Eat n park spaghetti and meatballs. THAT'S BAD! My Mom liked her duck breast I tried it (we all tried each other's food) it was good. The polenta was ok but you could tell the dish sat under the heat lamp it was gummy. My cousin enjoyed her ravioli and my Aunt and older son had the salmon which was good but again overpriced and the portion and presentation needed work. My niece said the baked ziti was ok. I did appreciate they let my 12 year of son and 13 year old niece order from the kids menu. We brought our own cake which they charge $20 just to cut which I knew and was fine with. Now our sever was very friendly but he was busy and we had long waits in between courses. He forgot my husband's drink and my cousin ordered a second drink which never came. The manager caught it and made sure we weren't charged. Our water was kept filled and the food runners were very nice. We waited about 25 minutes for the cake to be served from the time we asked for it, by then our coffee was cold. The coffee was luke warm and tasted like it was old. My Mom enjoyed herself and they didn't rush us we talked and laughed which I appreciated. Nothing worse than being rushed. We're not the type to complain for the sake of complaining. I love Lidia's cook books I have made several of her dishes. But this was disappointing and I don't think I will ever go back. I know Saturdays they are pushing food out but quality control is sorely lacking and the prices are crazy for the food quality and portion sizes. I will pay any amount if the food is great. My Mom was happy so that was all that mattered. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Lidia's is mediocre food you are paying for a name.",

    "text": "So, we've been here twice.  As a rule, I don't write a review of a restaurant until I've been twice.  Having a good or poor experience on a first visit could be a fluke.  Enough chat, on with the review.  We wanted to love this place, but there are several factors that just leave this place lacking.    On the first visit, we ordered two glasses of wine, the calamari for an appetizer, and tried their tableside pasta service.  The calamari was good and cooked correctly.  However, the three types of pasta we tried in their tableside service were not good.  The flavors were muddy and the pasta itself was very overcooked.  In retrospect, I should've known better than to order the tableside pasta, as I could've guessed the pasta was sitting in the back on a sterno waiting to be served.  Pasta should only be served fresh, as sitting under or over heat will continue to cook the pasta.  And quite honestly, the price for the app, entrees and wine were pretty steep.  On our second visit, they initially sat the two of us at this huge round 4 top.  It was difficult to have a conversation between the two of us and awkward sitting at this giant table alone.  Additionally, the table next to us had a toddler banging on the plates with the silverware.  It was obvious that we were there as a couple to have a date night.  Ultimately, we requested a more adequate table.  For our meal, we ordered the grilled octopus as an appetizer, the hubby ordered the lamb shank, I ordered the pork chop, and we ordered brussels sprouts for the table.  The octopus was good, but there was an abundance of red pepper on the dish and my palette was completely engulfed in spice.  The entrees were extremely bland.  I was searching all over for the salt and pepper shakers, but there are none to be found on the table.  Unfortunately, they refuse to add any salt or pepper to their dishes, and refuse to provide you the option to add any at the table.  Again, the bill at the end of the night was extreme and we walked away realizing that this place charges an arm and a leg for their bland food simply to pay for the rent and decor.  Pros: Convenient for residents of The Strip Decor is beautiful Service is impeccable  Cons: Food is very bland - absolutely no flavor Pasta isn't great Prices are way too high for the quality of food they are serving No real consideration for the comfort of their guests  End result - We won't be going back.",

The newly renovated restaurant is amazing. A little Art Deco influence amongst the industrial strip district is a beautiful juxtaposition that makes you forget where you are.   We had wine from Lidia's vineyard -- a nice white that was not too sweet and not too dry -- perfect with our Caesar salads.  Which after the salad alone, I was pretty full.   Three pastas: walnut pesto, mushroom ravioli, and a savory meat sauce. It was a lot to handle.   Finished with a beautiful and immaculate dessert which you don't think you have room for until you take one bite and suddenly you've cleaned your plate.   My experience here was nothing less than excellent. The executive chef here is running a fantastic kitchen.",

We arrived during the brunch time. We were given the choice of a complimentary mimosa or some other alcoholic drink that I do not remember. I chose the mimosa and it was very good. The champagne and orange juice really complimented each other.   The appetizers/salad bar thing was pretty good. Not really all that extraordinary. The Caesar salad could have used more cheese and dressing in my opinion.   Entree was very good. I had the beef roast with Swiss chard mashed potatoes and a red wine sauce. I was able to use just a fork to cut into the meat. It was very tender and had the perfect amount of fat. My friend said her gnocchi with duck ragu was good, but was a little bit cold when it was brought out. She opted not to send it back to be reheated.   The tiramisu dessert was absolutely delicious. It is the only dessert I chose because I absolutely love tiramisu.   The service was pretty good. Our server was nice and attentive, but he was almost too attentive. He hovered around the table a lot. I was very uncomfortable most of the time. My family was also a bit uncomfortable as well.",

Please note that I have only dined here for their Prix Fixe Brunch. I do not know when they raised their Brunch price but it is now $32.00 per person.  The menu is still the same and the staff is friendly and attentive.  I ordered the pork chop.  The most noticeable change is their buffet table.  It is 1/2 the size it used to be and the selections on the tables are few.  It was very disappointing how they raised the price $4 per person and downsized their buffet.  Most of the buffet table was occupied by two huge bowls of Cesar salad and then a small plate of luncheon meats with hardly any cheese, one small platter of eggplant, one terrine of soup, a hot plate of warm olives, and greens, two medium bowls of pasta salad. Off to the side was a very small table with 2 desserts and cookies.  Now this may sound like a decent buffet but previously the table was twice the size with many, many more choices of food, and better choices.  The dessert table had at least 5 desserts and cookies.   All in all the food was OK, but I was saddened by the buffet experience. Costing $32 per person, there are much better places to dine.",

We were also blown away by the prices--really reasonable.  The only down side, despite them not being at all busy...the service seemed super slow and at times inattentive.  We felt we had to flag down wait staff to assist us.

I called the day of to schedule reservations while some family had just gotten into town for a funeral.   We had Andy as our waiter, and he was pretty fantastic! His friendly banter with my family was great! Just what we needed.   We ordered, wine, champagne, beer across the board for the table. All reasonable, but they had options for higher end clientele, too! The mix of breads and spreads for the butter was very good. Loved the crunchy breadsticks.   I ordered a Caesar salad and split with my Aunt. My mother ordered the Osso Buco, so I knew it would be awhile and Andy also warned us. I also ordered the Eggplant Parm. It reminded me more of a napoleon ( which maybe I missed when reading the menu). I was surprised it didn't come with pasta, but that was actually perfect, because I couldn't even finish the 3 stacks of the eggplant that arrived.   Andy was so sweet, he brought us a Tiramasu for the table.   Will definitely recommend to our Pittsburgh friends and family, thanks for treating us like family while visiting.",

First was a bottle of wine that was not the year described in the listing.   Next was an appetizer we were told was not available 15 minutes after we ordered it.   Yet the charge for it remained in our tab.  And the worst was a very loud table of 8 that was extremely loud disturbing the entire second floor.   I mean singing and  banging on the tables is great if we are at a beer hall, but not a fine restaurant.  No comments were made by staff.   The pork chop was tough but well seasoned.  Steak was tough.  Cappuccino cup was dirty with a hair in the coffee.  Too bad as we are fans.",

My boyfriend had the pasta trio and only one of the pastas was good- the other two were very over seasoned and not very good.   The worst part about this place though is the service. We sat for 20 minutes waiting for our waitress. We were never asked if we wanted another drink and barely ever saw our waitress after the first time she came around. The pasta trio was supposed to be unlimited but we could never find someone to come to our table to give us more.  Overall, a disappointing experience. Would give it 2 stars, but the chicken Parmesan was surprisingly good. Would not recommend overall though.",

I had gone twice to Lidia's around a year ago and the food was phenomenal, the restaurant was busy as could be and we still got our food at a reasonable time.   This time around, we all order the pasta trio and the shrimp pasta was tasteless with the shrimp being so tiny and over cooked. I do not eat meat and the one pasta had meat so I asked the server if I could just have a pasta with red sauce instead but she was very hesitant to asked the chef and never came back to tell us if he was able to do it or not.

Entrees took an absurdly long time to arrive and the dining room was not even busy. Unfortunately, though the appetizers were good enough, the entrees disappointed. Meat cooked properly but not particularly flavorful. Plates were too simple, lacked balance (too much starch or not enough; too dry or too much sauce, etc). Pasta unimpressive. We then ordered desserts and cocktails. By the time the drinks arrived, most had already finished their dessert! Ridiculous.",

Those that ordered the pasta trio only got 2 of the 3 and when we complained, the waitress said all 3 would be coming back out, after another wait the same 2 dishes came out again with the 3rd finally following. We could hear the wait staff talking to one another and complaining about the kitchen and other customers in the restaurant. Very unprofessional. For the prices they charge they need to do better.

We were greeted with an inquiry about our water choice, so far so good.  There was never a question if we wanted other drinks; I had to ask. Drink was not delivered with the requested garnish. The food was served fast, too fast. It was rushed for an Italian meal, especially with a very open dining room.  The pasta course was ordered to be shared and it arrived with the main entrees--called on the menu \"Secondi\" for apparently no reason.  Double espresso was served without a spoon.  When the waiter was asked for a spoon, he deputized another server and waited on the table next to us.  A soup spoon was brought.  When I asked for a different spoon, the deputy come to the table holding the spoon out and asks, \"Is this what you want?\"  On the way out, the greeter asked how the meal was, when we said that the service was bad, we got a, \"I'm sorry.\"  There was no \"In what way?\" or  \"How can we  fix it.\"    Not the professionalism I would have expected at Lidia's.",

Half of us didn't care for our dishes.   We ordered:  Soft shell crab sandwich - 3/5 stars because they of too much sauce on the sandwich. Was too messy to eat well. I was told they just added this sandwich to the menu as of Monday...4 days ago  Smoked salmon salad - was told it wasn't that great  Grilled salmon - was told the mustard sauce served atop the dish wasn't that great   Service: server was very nice and polite. But he was so slow. We mentioned we needed to get back to a business meeting to speed things up. Didn't make a difference. As mentioned earlier, the place wasn't busy at all   Overall, I wouldn't strongly recommend this place. I don't even live in this state, so I can't come back soon to give it another try.",

    "text": "We're locals who hadn't come here yet, but had out of town guests (parents, aunt and uncle) who had eaten at other branches and were insistent on going.  Plenty of good Italian elsewhere in Pittsburgh, but we tried hard to give it a chance.  Came on a fairly busy Saturday night, but had a reservation and were very happy to be seated right at our prompt arrival.  Received menus but no wine list upon seating.  Server greeted us nicely, but it really went south from there.  Long story short, it was over half an hour before a drink order was even taken (seriously? isn't the bar the biggest profits in the house?).  Even if the kitchen is slammed (I'm very, very tolerant on a busy night) at least bring the drinks and I can be extremely patient.  45 min before cocktails came.  Almost an hour with menus sitting in front of us.  Very, very, not cool.  Appetizers finally came at some point, highlight of the night.  To be fair, the aranchini and zucchini fritters were quite good.  I'll credit them for the second star.  The lemon chicken I ordered as an entree was good but nothing special.  I was glad I avoided the pasta tasting, but others at my table did.  As other reviewers have described, there is nothing at all special about it.  Even though the servers are tonging it out of a frying pan, it's clear visually and from the taste that the pastas are scooped out of a warmed-over hotel pan, and not remotely cooked to order.  While more than good enough for banquet food or weekday leftovers at home, completely disappointing and unacceptable for a good neighborhood Italian restaurant, let alone an establishment passing it off as fine dining.  Service was very polite, but super slow and disorganized.  I didn't have huge expectations for the food, but really wanted to give it a chance.  Sadly, it was quite disappointing.  Having eaten at several other B&B restaurants, I know this group can turn out some excellent dining experiences.  It's so unfortunate they seem to have completely lost their mojo in Pittsburgh.",

The food has lost its spark, the Osso bucco was over cooked the risotto was not flavored just tasting of store bought chicken stock with no salt. The staff looked uninterested and now the big one...the carpet! This place has been open for almost two decades and the carpet smells of it! It is disgusting! Mold and mildew will great your senses as you enter! Puts off the appetite. Maybe that's why you can't fill reservations on a weekend night? Only the finest and fewest restaurants should have carpet. It takes care to keep it from smelling. People here don't care and so it stinks! And it stinks bad! Will not go back until changes are made!",

Being familiar with the restaurant and the menu, we immediately placed our order. 3 pasta trios, an \"Americano\" breakfast (eggs sunny side up), and eggplant parmigiana. Obviously, very quick dishes. Unfortunately something went wrong.  Drinks were empty. Throats were parched. Toddlers were beginning to crack. After waiting one hour, I went to the front desk to ask a manager to look into the situation and if possible provide us with an alternative waitress, as our waitress, Cindy, had not visited our table in 45 minutes. As you would expect, this cleared things up and we received our meals within the next 15 minutes, and even was asked if we'd like any more drinks!  In short, I am not sure if the issue lie with the kitchen or the server, and no one offered any explanations.  I do know, however, that our server was definitely not our advocate, either in making sure our experience was going well, or in tracking the progress of our order.   They comped us 50%, and I asked them to waive the comp as I informed them I would be posting this review but they insisted on the discount, so they owned it, for whatever that is worth.",

Had a reservation toward the end of the night, there were maybe only ten other tables. Our server was great, but somehow we ended up getting our first course before we got our drinks. Only one bartender working and he seemed really overwhelmed, seems nuts for a Friday night.   There was what appeared to be a wedding rehearsal dinner in the private area upstairs, maybe fifty or so people, and they only had one valet attendant working. At the end of the night you had scores of drunk annoying wedding party people trying to get their cars and then just not leaving once he brought them up so the guy was getting rightly exasperated. Expecting one guy to handle dozens of cars for a party of at least fifty leaving at one time is absolutely ridiculous. It just doesn't seem like this place staffs appropriately and it makes the employees look bad.",

The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning.

Overall we found that the pasta dishes were far better than the other dishes with the exception of the lamb chops which were prefect. My sister & I both got the ricotta gnudi which was in giant balls and delicious but I would have preferred if it was in smaller gnocchi like shapes. My brother got the burratta which was very good but also huge. My brother's fiance got the ceasar salad which she said was good but also a very large portion.   For our main courses the highlights were definitely the gnocchi, the pasta tasting trio, and the Angello (lamb chops). I ended up getting the Saltimbocca alla  Romano which had great flavors but was overcooked. My sister got the sausage, which was okay, but not as great as we would expect for a restaurant owned by Lydia. The lasagna was also not as good as you would have thought.   The best of the desserts was the gelato trio, but the tiramisu & upside down rhubarb cake was also good (although the rose gelato wasn't so great) .",

    "text": "2.5 Stars  My boyfriend and I each purchased a groupon to Lidias.  The groupon (meal for 2) included a $32 bottle of wine; choice between salad or soup; an all you can eat pasta trio; and dessert (tiramisu).  The first time we went, I would have rated Lidias with one star.  The service was sub-par on a Friday night. We were seated at a table too close to a service station and my seat kept being bumped into.  The bottle of wine we ordered never arrived until after we were mostly finished with our salads.  As for the food, the Caesar salad was OK, but I was really disappointed by the pastas.  The goat cheese ravioli was bland, and the other 2 pastas lacked in flavor as well (rigatoni with an olive oil based sauce and pasta in a meat sauce, which lacked in meat).  The second trip was better, bumping Lidias up to 2.5 stars.  We went midweek (Wednesday), and the service improved, although we still received our bottle of wine after the salads.  The quality and taste of the pastas also improved.  The pasta was fresh and had much more flavor (spaghetti noodles with red peppers, mushroom ravioli, and rigatoni with sweet sausage and onion).  Both times we got the dessert to go.  Our waitress also boxed up the remainder of our all you can eat pasta for us to take home with us (which was nice).  If you have the groupon, I would recommend going on a week night when they aren't as busy for better service.  I would also call ahead to see what pastas they are serving that day.  I wouldn't want to pay full price for the meal, as there are better options for Italian food in the city.",

Overall, my impression is that in Pittsburgh,  there are a number of local Italian restaurants where you can get as good or better pasta dishes for a better value. I had the pasta trio and a salad- 30 bucks.  You get as much as you want,  but really how much pasta do you need... The pasta dough itself was very good,  Lidia has that recipe down. The 3 dishes were a pork filled ravioli,  a creamy dish with peas and asparagus,  and a tomato based pasta with small shrimp. They were all decent,  not great.  I did ask for a second helping of the ravioli,  and a few of them were cold in spots,  which tells me that they had been frozen and not boiled long enough.  Service was very good and ambiance was pleasant. Not many in the restaurant on a Wednesday evening at 730. Considering my 3 experiences here,  I have to land on three stars,  because I just don't think the food is memorable enough,  or worth what they are charging considering other great options in the area.",

Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment.  We went for a late lunch around 1:30.  I ordered the chicken scaloppine and chose the soup.  The soup was described by our server as a fennel, spinach and bean soup.  What I received was void of fennel and spinach.  It was a thick cup of white beans in a tomato base.  Also, very bland.  No salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  This drives me crazy.  The scaloppine wasn't much better.  My husband ordered the sausage and peppers over polenta.  I think he got maybe 4 ounces of sausage and a few peppers.  This restaurant is overpriced for the product you received.  Very disappointing.",

The antipasto offerings included a number of crunchy salads that were nice and vibrant. I got the egg/potato/cheese plate which was decadent and more than one person could eat, but it was tasty nonetheless. My husband got the pasta sampler including hand made gnocchi that was silky and smooth. Others at our table were satisfied with the steak, salmon, and trout options as well. Glad I saved a bit of space for dessert although if I'm back I won't sample everything again and instead I'll just focus on the tiramisu, which was by far and away the best sweet offered.",

    "text": "A restaurant that has gone steeply downhill...  It's been roughly 2-3 years since I have been to lidias, an experience in which I remember having decent food and service... Tonight was far different.  Overall, let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated. Colors and decor seem boring and out of style. I didn't get that warm feeling I should in a place where there are white clothes, $12 average glasses of wine (like come on - I looked up the crappy bottle it came from) and waiters everywhere.  The service was horrible. From hostess crew to the bar to the waitress, it was bad. The hostess forgot about us, then when I reminded him we were waiting (40 minutes - despite a reservation), to which he said \"oh yes, I was just going to get you\"... But he wasn't because we stood there a few minutes while he set the table. Rude.  Did I mention the service was bad? Well, while we were waiting we had a glass of wine each (a steep $13.50 glass each - definitely didn't live up to my expectations). The bar staff wasn't concerned with us and weren't friendly at all. They were chatting to themselves and basically ignoring us.  When we got to the table, it took 10 mins to meet our waitress. Then it took another 15 to order.  Then 50 mins to get our food!!! I had the pasta trio (remember this meal takes no time to cook  - as this is ready made and constantly being served) and my wife had the porkchop. Honestly, we typically enjoy our restaurant food (just read my Casbah review) but our food was really just so-so. My wife's pork chop was fatty and over-cooked (despite the waitress specifically making note of how the chef prefers to cook it medium). My pasta was decent, which I ate, and requested seconds (which is allowed for the trio because they give you very small portions).... However, seconds never came. Waitress didn't even know until I told her politely. Then she blamed new staff working the pasta routes... No good enough reason for me - sorry.   Then the bill.  I ordered the pasta trio for $23 and the waitress asked me if I wanted to upgrade my Salad for $2, to which I approved. However she charged the $36 pasta trio (which comes with desert). I told her this was a mistake and she agreed and ran back with a new check. Now I had a $10 salad and $23 pasta trio. I was expecting $23 +$2 salad upgrade. Nope. So I explained to her politely that I ordered the $23 trio to which she (must have) mistakenly offered me an upgrade. I accepted. However I was told I was wrong and she didn't offer to make this right. Ugh. Seriously you want to fight me on it? Especially when I know I was being appropriately (not like I was trying to score a free meal). Isn't the rule \"customer is always right\"?  Finally, we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined. How many people did we see in tie-dye shirt or wearing hats (literally wearing hats at 8:30pm in a fine dining restaurant)? We saw enough to know that this isn't the lidias we expected.  We won't ever go back or recommend the place.  As far as we are concerned - there is a very good reason that you don't have a problem getting a reservation here (because IT STINKS!).   Avoid!",

It seems that now that Lidia is famous she is no longer involved in the cooking  so the food is like any larger chain or worse without the quality control. Table cloth was dirty, the staff was not friendly and the decor and furniture were unkept. The best part were the breadsticks and dips with olive oil. Would not recommend it.",

    "text": "My coworker had been recommending Lidia's to me for a while, and I'm glad I listened to her and brought my family here for dinner last week.  We had a wonderful Italian meal, and one of the better dining experiences in Pittsburgh so far.  We had a reservation on Saturday night around 6 pm, and used their valet service ($5?  $6?  I forget).  We were seated right away, and we all admired the gorgeous dining room space.  It seems to have been built in an old warehouse - the ceiling is massively high, and there's gorgeous Mondrian-esque glass over the bar.  Very stylish!    I should also say right off the bat that our server was outstanding.  Friendly, funny, and knowledgeable, he was one of the best parts of the whole experience.  He helped us choose a wine which we all enjoyed, and he poured it skillfully.  He was also helpful to us at various points throughout the meal - for example, four of us began with the Insalata di Rucola (split two salads between four people, and they came on separate plates).  The salad sounded amazing, with arugula, pear, walnuts, and gorgonzola (get in mah belleh) but we all noticed that there was quite a lack of...well, pear.  We all had maybe one measly little wedge, and it definitely kept the salad from being as yummy as it should have been.  So we told our server about it, and he immediately brought out a plate full of pear slices.  Redeemed!  And the salad became delicious.  My entree was the Ravioli di Cinghale (ravioli filled with wild boar, in a rosemary sauce) and it was pretty delicious.  Three big raviolis, filled with succulent meat (think pulled pork, but Italian and well-spiced).  The sauce was very very light, but still flavorful.  My dad got the Pasta Trio, and it was hilariously awesome to watch three different guys come by with big bowls, delivering their delicious wares to his plate.  He had a lot of fun with that.  My mom loved her sea bass as well.    Dad's pasta trio came with a dessert, so he got the Crostata di Pere, a sugary pear maple dessert which I think was good, but I don't have really strong memories of it so clearly it didn't bowl me over.  All in all, it was a very good meal with some truly excellent service.  We felt cared for and comfortable, and our bellies were full.  What more could we ask for?",

Mine seemed more uncooked and quite hard to the bite.  I didn't know al dente was this rough..The taste was unrefined like it was packaged and not thoroughly mixed for one of the pastas.  Another had too much salt and butter for my liking.  Of the three pastas, only one was done moderately well and tastes just as good (marinara sauce).  However, for three unlimited pastas, you can't go wrong. I was satisfied, even with the minor problems.  I guess at some point I truly value quantity over quality.  I do gotta say that I also tried a bit of the Gnocchi dish and that was superb.  Very fresh ingredients and each bite was incredibly fulfilling.  Next time I would try more of their signature dishes instead of the pasta trio dish because it is more than likely of sub-par quality when compared to the rest of the items on the menu due to its buffet feat.",

I typically don't like tomato based pasta sauces which at Lidia's is no problem because they have such a wide selection of pasta and sauces.    I've had the pasta trio each time that I've gone and I've really enjoyed it.  I've also tried some of the other dishes from the people I'm with and they all have been great.  Really enjoyed the Wild Boar Ravioli - delish!  If your in the Strip and happen to stroll by Lidia's you should check it out b/c you won't be disappointed.  I'll also add, that I'm not a big Tiramisu fan, but Lidia's is the only place that I not only eat Tiramasu but I enjoy it and becomes by dessert of choice.",

For twenty-five bucks you get a drink, fresh breads w/ yummy spreads, \"help yourself\" table buckling with cured meats and cheese, numerous salads and sides, pasta trio sampling, and a trip or two to the dessert table.  I should add that if the pasta sampler is not to your liking you can order other items, including salmon.  I always get the pasta sampler and the choices range from good to out of this world.  The ravioli dishes are consistently excellent and often filled with seasonal ingredients.  The side dishes are also very good, and while a romaine salad and bean and tuna salad are staples, other side dishes rotate, according to what's available/in season.  Wide variety of desserts at the dessert table.  The tiramisu is out of this world--served in individual ramekin cups.  Be sure to leave a little room for at least one of those little guys--you won't be sorry!  I'd give Lidia's five stars but their service is sometimes spotty.  I've gone when it's not overly busy, only to wait, wait, wait.  If you're not in a hurry and you're there for brunch, it's really not a big deal, but if you are looking for prompt service or have plans, like to go somewhere afterwards, this could be a pain.  I took my parents for dinner for their anniversary and the poor service was embarrassing.  At this dinner my mom also ordered wine and she got--no exaggeration--about 2-3 tablespoons in the glass.  I buttonholed the manager before we left and while he apologized that was it, no offer of even another wine (hopefully with a fuller glass).  But in the 5+ years I've gone, that was the worst experience I had.",

One of the bartenders was a lot more attentive than the other and even helped me find a wine to pair with my appetizer. Once sat at our table we switched from cocktails to wine. Decent wine list (I say decent because I will never spend more than $40 on a bottle of wine and they had some options in that category). The bread basket was amazing. We both ordered the pasta trio with the salad and dessert.   Our server was great - helpful and attentive, through our reservation on Open Table, we were able to list allergies, he made very sure that what we ordered didnt include anything that we might die from (thank you!).

    "text": "Lidia's was one of our favorite Italian restaurant in the city.  We have even eaten at her place in New York because we like the Pittsburgh restaurant so much. Well that has changed in our last two visits. During our most recent visit on Valentines day the food was on the level of an Atria's restaurant.  First, our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening. She had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions.  Second, our food was served just barley warm. Third, the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste.  The restaurant was only about 70% full at 8PM on one of the busiest days of the year. very sad",

    "text": "We had a 5 PM reservation, but it was 4:30 PM and we had no more places to go in the neighborhood to kill time, so we asked to be seated early. The hostess agreed to seat us early. I ordered the frico (sausage, broccoli rabe, potato, leeks) for my appetizer, but the waitress told me that the menu that she gave me was outdated and that the frico was not available to order. I ordered a caesar salad and calamari instead. For my entree, I ordered the ravioli di cinghiale (gigantic boar ravioli). My husband, who is part Italian and lived in Italy when he was a child, said that he was unimpressed with the menu, and he simply ordered salmon. The caesar salad tasted sour and needed more cheese. The calamari, boar ravioli, and salmon tasted good. The wait staff was nice and brought out our food and drinks on time. We were not thrilled with the taste of the food for the price, so we will not return.",
