    "text": "Cool place. Meatballs are what I came for and they were worth it. Did a few and tried the different kinds of meatballs and sauces. Definately worth it especially on I believe it is Tuesday for reduced price balls. Service was prompt as I sat at the bar hoping for a quick lunch, and it was.  Bartender was super nice and willing to explain or answer questions my first time and seemed to know the menu well.  Its worth a shot if you like trying something old yet something new on return visits. Have been a few times not and trying different sauce and meat combos is fun. The poutine was decent and prompted gravy as a sauce my first time. But that is not what any of us really went there for anyway.  #takingbackyelp",

    "text": "Meat and carbs --- how can you not love this place? Ron Swanson, or any other comparable meat enthusiast, would indeed be proud that a place like this exists.  As the name of the restaurant suggests, Emporio: A Meatball Joint specializes in meatballs. You can combine your meatballs with one of many carbolicious sides which include Mac & cheese, Parmesan-Herb fries, tater tots, Penne pasta, and many other healthier and non-healthier (read: heart attack inducing) sides.  I went there on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and had the special for the day which was a chicken jalapeno cheddar meatball. I ordered two meatballs (you could order more than just two) with a side of Parmesan-Herb French fries.  Although I pride myself in being able to finish my dishes, in part to avoid wasting food and in part because I love food, I can honestly say that I was unable to finish my meal.  Yep, I was defeated by meatballs.  The total price for the special two meatballs with sauce and Parmesan herb fries was about $14.00 (not including tip).  I think for the portion size and the quality of taste, the price was very reasonable.",

I was there just a few minutes before Happy Hour ended and the bartender made sure to let me know AND get my drink order in time.   I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with marinara. I've tried most of their meatballs and sauce combos and they are always delicious. The menu can look a little small at first, but the ease of creating a new and different combo instantly expands your selections. I would also recommend an order of tots, if you're into it.   The bartender made this experience even better. She was friendly and engaging. She also placed an order for food for two other friends who were running late so they could eat and not be late to our show time.",

    "text": "First of all, I've been here LOTS of times. I first came when they originally opened and I was a vegetarian. The veg meatballs are fantastic and I was thrilled to have a delicious option. The spinach almond pesto was inane good and llthe meatball became the delivery vehicle for this unbelievable sauce. I was also fond of the taziki sauce. Both so fresh, light, and full of flavor.  And their rocket salad was always my favorite.  This was definitely a 5 star place at this point.  Then this one day, when I decided I was really to lose my vegetarian virginity, I chose the Meatball Joint to do so. The bartender was so excited for me and really helped me do it up iright. I noticed the spinach almond pesto was no longer on the menu, but there was a basil cream, and I thought that sounded fantastic.  I got 4 beef meatballs, one with basil cream, one with arrabiata, and one with mushroom gravy. They were delicious, but I was also intoxicated.  I have since gone back several times, sober, and I have to say, their sauce options are many, but they are all so thick and heavy and they just don't excite me. I've begged many times to bring the spinach almond pesto back and the manager has said he hears that multiple times a day. So why do you keep this flavorless basil cream?  Additionally, I went with a friend not long ago and he ordered tots with a bbq chicken (flavor of the month) meatball on top. They brought fries with a completely naked ball on top. We asked and they said that when people order that way they leave the sauce off.  WTH?!?! That's the whole reason he ordered it in the first place, for the BBQ sauce!!!  Basically, it's not that exciting anymore and in my opinion has gone from a fun, yummy place, to an average place that will fulfill potential future intoxicated needs. That's really not great.",

Every time I've come I have tried a new type of meatball/sauce combination, and have yet to be disappointed. You could water board me with the chicken gravy and I would die happy. On another note though, as someone who's overly French Canadian I'm more partial towards traditional style poutine while Emporio's is a fancier take on the greasy side dish--however they do give you the option to pick between different gravy's which I have yet to see in other restaurants.",

So, my last day in Pittsburgh, I decided to try this meatball joint.  I ordered the forgetaboutit bowl with two meatballs.  I added two more so I could try all the meat ones.  There was an option for a vegetarian meatball, but what's the point.  My favorite meatball was the standard beef, second was the spicy pork, third their special which had pepperoni and lastly the chicken.  All the meatballs except the beef, seemed overly salty, especially the special.  The chicken was a tad rubbery.  Overall the pasta was served hot and the dish was bold and flavorful.  My server was Kasjah and she was very attentive.  My only suggestion is there's so many flavors with the sauces and shaved Parmesan, there's no need to overly salt the meatball.  I'd still give this joint a try, especially if you love meatballs",

One odd thing did happen though--Our server was very friendly and casual, especially with our one friend. it took a long time for our check to come. After quite a few minutes, the server came back and said to my friend, \"Sorry it's taking so long, I'm just waiting on my manager to apply the discount.\" We were confused on why we were getting a discount, but who would question that?   Shortly after that, the server gave her a check with a 50% employee discount and the bartender walked by and placed a beer in front of her and said, \"Here you go, Rebecca! On the house.\" My friend (who is NOT an employee or named Rebecca) was mortified and paid her check with plenty of extra cash and ran out of the restaurant, breaking her shoe on her way to her car. I stayed at our table with my other friend and laughed really hard and drank the beer that was intended for the employee they thought my friend was.  If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, we would love to come back, pay full price for our meatballs, and see how alike my friend and the real Rebecca look side by side.",

If you aren't hungry, you can't go wrong with the sliders or a panini. I really like how they recently added various bowl options as well; they all look delicious! I have yet to try any of the dessert that they have, but I am looking to go back soon to give the dessert a try! I have to make a mental note to make sure to save some room!  Overall, it's a great atmosphere with even better food.  After you finish your meal, make your way over to the elevator to go up to the top floor and have yourself a drink on the rooftop bar!",

The server was pleasant and prompt. We ordered drinks and reviewed the menu. When she arrived back at the table with the beverages we ordered our meals. We both got the paninis. I ordered the standard meatballs with provolone cheese and marinara. My hubby got the spicy pork meatballs with provolone and the Aribata sauce. The sandwiches were the perfect lunch size and came with the sauce as a sidecar. It was an excellent feature as sauce on a panini can cause it to be mushy. However our sandwiches were nice and crispy with the cheese melted perfectly. We had an all around great meal for a Saturday lunch. We'll definitely be back.",

Of course at the moment I forget what the special IPA they had was but it was so delicious, I think I took a photo of it haha!

Its cool because you can mix and match and choose different sauces as well.  I was with a pretty decent sized group, and we all got different items.  Everyone loved their food.  I basically built my own meatball bowl with mac and cheese, a chicken ball, the classic ball, and the special which was a cheeseburger ball that day.   I also got crack sauce, government cheese, and basil pesto cream. Totally worth it!  Our server helped me make my choices, and I was extremely pleased. Flavors were on point, portions pretty big, and the prices are not bad either.   I would suggest mixing and matching so you can try various items.  There are so many great choices!

My boyfriend and I had already enjoyed Mezzo this summer (the nicer, more upscale restaurant on the middle level) and have wandered upstairs to the rooftop bar, Il Tetto, as well.    The street level is home to Emporio- which is all things meatballs! DELICIOUS. I am a lover of meatballs, hold the spaghetti.... so I knew I would enjoy. We started with the buffalo fried chicken balls with bleu cheese -- unexpectedly we enjoyed them so much more than we thought we would!! We then got around to ordering- you can pair your meatballs with sides, put it on a sandwich, or just plain with sauce. We both opted for plain with different sauces and it was a hit!!! The beef was both of our favorites - and the crack sauce (in one word) is awesome!!!   Go check this place out...",

Emporio can be a bit confusing to find... it is one of the three restaurants at Sienna Mercato: Emporio is the meatball shop on the first floor; Mezzo is a classic Italian restaurant on the second floor; Il tetto is the beer garden on the third floor.  My friend and I walked in for lunch thinking we were at Mezzo, which turns out to only open for dinner. Thankfully, we were blessed by discovering this gem. We each ordered a meatball slider ($3.5) + side pasta ($5.5); we also shared a rocket salad ($6). At first, the portion looked small, but the food was surprising very filling and tasty!  Will come back here for the saucy balls! --  taste / 4 aesthetics / 4 vibe / 4 service / 4 price for quality / 4 OVERALL / 4",

You can either make your own dish by choosing what type of meatball you want(beef, pork, vegetarian, or chicken) and then you choose what sauce you want...they have marina sauce, meat sauce, government cheese, sausage gravy, and even a few more! Then you can choose if you want your meatball(s) on pasta, bread, or even fries. If you don't want to make your own, they have a ton of put together meatball bowls/sandwiches put together. Besides the food, atmosphere is great, and the service was great as well! Definitely will go back in the future!",

I went with some local dietitian friends that had never been before and shared my recommendations. I order the sliders with no buns so I can customize the flavors. My favorites are the chicken meatball and vegetarian meatball. Typically I got with pesto or creamy Parmesan but the tomato basil is a new fav! The ball of the month is always a fun way to try something new and different. For sides I like the risotto or Brussels. A bowl is also a great way to order if you know what you like and don't crave variety.",

For an entree, I got the Angry Birds dish which was great but I would recommend getting two meatballs instead of  four. Four was an absolute ton and I couldn't finish my dish. As far as the atmosphere goes, it is super loud and there are too many tables in a small space. I was bumped into by servers no less than ten times while I was eating. Also, their wait policy is ridiculous. We had our entire party (7 people) but one person who was parking the car and they wouldn't even get a table together for us until everyone was present. Overall, pretty great food but the service and atmosphere is overrated.",

I ordered 3 meatballs -- beef with red sauce, pork with sausage gravy, and chicken with pesto.  All sounded like winning combos but, in reality?  Lukewarm, rather dry meatballs, with very tepid sauces.  And flavors?  Pretty darned bland.  Would I go again?  Hmmm...

Even the ones they sell at IKEA are better. I decided to get the beef meatballs with the mushroom gravy. The gravy was too starchy and got very goopy a few minutes after it got to my table   I also got a side of pasta - gnocchi with creamy Parmesan sauce. Sauce was good but the pasta was bad. Probably should have chosen a safer one like penne or spaghetti. The gnocchi was very doughy and just didn't taste like it was cooked enough maybe? Either way, I wouldn't come back here. It wasn't inedible and the food itself was actually very cheap but I would rather spend a few extra bucks on somewhere better.",

If it were out of 10, I'd probably give it a 7, but sadly I cannot, so it's a 3/5 for me.   Ordered:  - Angry Birds bowl - chicken meatballs with mac & cheese, additional blue cheese, and a hot sauce ranch - Loaded Baked Potato bowl - beef meatballs with mashed potatoes, cheese sauce, bacon, and scallions  - Brussel sprouts with parmesan   Pros:  - Very nice servers/ staff - Fast service (could have been because of our later time) - Good beer selection / draft list  - Fun/ unique place for something different  - Brussels were great - crispy, tasty.   Cons:  - For being a meatball place, I found the chicken balls to be overcooked and a bit difficult to cut into to eat. The beef were slightly better, but also tough to cut into. I chalk it up to coming later in the evening/ the balls having been baked earlier in the day, but who knows. For the price/ quality and what it is (a couple of meatballs on some potatoes or mac and cheese - what they call \"government cheese\" no less....) I feel there are better options.   Overall, a decent place with a fun theme. Probably wouldn't make my way there often, but would definitely come back to check out the other two restaurants on the other floors.",

When I asked for an orange slice the bartender grabbed it was his bare hands and dropped it in my glass.   At that point I paid my tab and after drinking less than half my beer, I left!!",

The crack sauce on the chicken ball is addictive. Also, I like the mushroom gravy on the pork and the gov cheese on the beef. They offer a vegetarian ball made of mushroom, white bean and cauliflower which I enjoy with basil pesto cream. The last time I went on a Tuesday... and ordered the ball of the month, hot sausage balls that came with onion and green peppers as a panini Added provolone cheese and the marinara. Yummy!!!",

We had a large group of 10, so we had to wait about 45 to get seated but it was a Saturday night so we expected that.  Everyone ordered their own thing and I didn't get to really ask everyone but I ordered a chicken ball and a vegetarian ball with government cheese over green beans with almonds . It was very good! The balls are pretty large and super different. The vegetarian ball was a little dry for my taste but the cheese made it more moist. The green beans were crisp and had a nice crunch. The almonds were crunchy and there were a lot . It was a great addition.  I enjoyed my meal and our server was super nice !",

The ball of the month - the dragon ball - was so very good.  We were able to get \"saucy balls\" with 2 dragon balls and 2 other balls of our choice.  It was scrumptious!  Our waitress was on top of our service - refilled our drinks promptly, delivered food, took plates, etc.  Everything was great and quick and easy.  The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars.  We each had separate checks  (3 of us) 2 paid with credit cards, I paid with cash.  When my change was brought (my bill was $21.50 and I paid $30) - our waitress rounded my total up to $22 - and brought me $8 back.  While it is likely that I would leave a tip including that 50 cents - I did not appreciate the assumption.  What if I had chosen to not leave a tip due to horrendous service?  (although I don't foresee myself ever doing that! and we didn't have horrendous service)  You never assume what your tip is going to be.  I still left a decent tip - but I was disappointed by that assumption.   Otherwise the food was great and the service was great.",

We were looking to fill out stomachs with the first meal of the day without paying a dinner prices. The service was really nice since we were seated right away and greeted with smiles at the door. The server was nice enough to offer suggestions and refill our water frequently. I had the meatball grinder with chicken balls, provolone cheese, and marinara sauce. It was a delight!!! I can't wait to go back and try another sauce. The meatballs were plenty big for me. I may have actually stuffed myself that day. The table also shared a plate of poutines with fires which was a nice starter. The food also came out rather quickly and everything was correct for everyone's order. I'm definitely a fan.",

    "text": "Okay, who doesn't like meatballs? Everyone loves meatballs! What better than picking the type of meatballs and the sauce?! That's exactly what you can do here. You can pick between the type of meatballs (beef, pork, vegetarian, chicken) and the sauce (too many to list). I couldn't make up my mind so I went with one of their suggested combination, Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-a-Ball. The pork meatballs were juicy and delicious. The cheese tortellini were a good compliment to the meatballs. The spicy arrabbita sauce with sliced up jalapenos really brought everything together. This is not a dish for someone that cannot handle heat. It is spicy but it is just oh-so-good spicy. My better half ordered the Angry birds. The crack sauce is freaking awesome. It really makes you wanting more long after the dish is finished and licked clean. Each of these came with two meatballs and you are able to add on more meatballs if you like. For us, two meatballs were the perfect amount. I washed it all down with a Victory Kirsch Gose, a sour beer. They do have late night happy hour starting at 930pm as well.",

I ordered the $13 veggie meatballs with the Arabbiatta sauce, my hubs ordered the special which was the bacon cheeseburger meatballs as sliders. $4 a piece. We shared a side of tater tots $6. The veggie meatballs were basically heavily pureed black beans with no flavoring and were dried and crusty on the top. No veggies that I could see. The arabbiatta sauce tasted like condensed tomato puree in a can with some heat.  My husband's meatballs had the consistency of canned cat food. He did not taste or see any bacon. The cheese was like that cheap pump nacho cheese. Perhaps, we had been too excited from romancing our own  idea of this place thinking it might be high grade ingredients crafted with love. Instead, gravely disappointing. We didn't finish the meal.  We both felt gross afterwards and grabbed a salad at another restaurant to refresh our palates.",

This menu is fully customizable. Satisfy each and every one of your taste buds as you create the meatball masterpiece of your dreams.   A creation for every craving. I'm a huge fan of the \"saucy balls\" entree. It comes with four huge meatballs, but you reduce it to two meat balls for a reduced fee. Enjoy it with a red sauce over pasta for a more traditional Italian fare, or pair it up with Crack Sauce over Tater tots for a more \"pub-friendly\" option.   Do yourself a favor and order a side of the Brussel sprouts. It might not be the healthiest Brussel sprout rendition, but it is certainly the tastiest.   Food allergy/preference friendly.",

I should have only ordered a meatball slider (which was another recommendation from a fellow foodie) after so many appetizers but I had yummy leftovers the following morning before the Steelers game.  The only thing I would not do again is the poutine but, side note: I also got the sauce on the side (in case it was too spicy for the kids). In hindsight, it probably would have better ON the fries.   The server explained how the meatball selection works. It was a bit overwhelming so all of us went with the preset bowls. I got the Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-a-Ball! spicy pork balls, cheese tortellini arrabbiata, jalapenos. It was spicy but good. Comes with 2 meatballs but you can add 2 more for $4 extra.   The kids spaghetti was generously sized. Enough for leftovers the next day. Then again, they also filled up on appetizers.   My friend and I tried the strawberry and pineapple beers. She didn't care for it and our waitress was nice enough to let her switch out her drink. Good service!   Tips: Use the No Wait App. We were #21 when we got in queue on the app and by the time we got out of our Uber and arrived at the restaurant we were #6. We barely finished our drinks at the rooftop beer garden when our table was ready.   T-shirts available by the hostess stand",

When we were seated the menu only had meatballs... and, we waiting no less than 10 minutes before our waitress made her way over. I could see her standing in the wait staff area chatting while we just sat. Finally when she came over, we asked about pizza and she said that it a different restaurant upstairs. I asked if they had a kids menu up there, she said no. Weird.  So we stayed and the service stayed bad.  We literally sat and could see about 6 staff, all probably under 25 years old, chatting to each other around the bar while we wanted to order, or waiting for water.  Food was actually pretty good - salads were huge and fresh, kids meals were solid. But service was so bad we wouldn't go back.",

At Emporio, you get to choose your meatball type, pick the accompanying sauce and decide to enjoy them as sliders or a panini or over pasta. My veggie meatball+Arrabiata sauce slider was delish! I also ordered a side of the tomato risotto which was fantastic. Warm and creamy, it certainly hit the spots for me that cold afternoon. The portion sizes of their sides and bowls are rather generous. Don't plan on going back to work after lunch at Emporio. My risotto was quite heavy and I definitely needed a nap after my meal. If you're not feeling like meatballs (who are you!?!), their menu also has multiple soup and salad options. You can even add a meatball to your salad! They've a decent draft list but I went with their sangria that day which was also pretty good. I definitely will be going back coz where else in Pittsburgh will you find veggie meatballs! And all those sauce options...mmmm! They have happy hour specials every weekday from 4-6.. WIN!",

I got the brussels sprouts as my side, but the portion was big enough for an appetizer for two!  They were awesome, though, as was the poutine!  For dessert, we had the chocolate chip cookies, which tasted okay and had a nice texture, but they were served cold.. it might have been a game changer if they had been warm!",

We ordered the poutine with pork belly and it was amazing. It was such a great combination of flavors. We each ordered a meatball entree and considering it comes with pasta and the meatballs are large, it was a large portion and filling. My friend and I also had a pre-appetizer appetizer though, so maybe you'll need a little more yourself. The meatball options are all unique and interesting. If I could've, I would've tried more than one option, but it's just another reason to go back. I tried the standard Fuggeta Bowl It bowl and even though it's what you'd expect when you think of meatballs, it didn't make it any less delicious. After the meal, we went up to the rooftop bar and enjoyed an old fashioned. This was one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.",

We got fried pickles- which is enough easily for atleast 3 people, she got a vegetarian meatball sammich, which is made of mushrooms, chickpeas and I forget what else. I got a chicken ()and cheese) meatball bowl. Yikes- so much food for 2 girls !! So, we split everything we ordered AND took a bunch home. I would no doubt eat here again.

Beef with arrabiatta, spicy pork with government cheese, and the meatball of the day, pizza (I think it was pork with cheese) with pizza sauce. All were just amazing!

I hate when places like this refuse to seat you until the whole party is present. I dropped off some of my party because it's winter and didn't think everyone should have to walk but once my party got inside they would not seat us until everyone was present. It was a busy Friday night downtown and took awhile to find a spot. I think it's just poor form and really starts you off on a bad note. Plus it crowds the waiting area and may turn people away that are walking by. Okay enough of that soapbox. This place has a pretty cool vibe and obviously if meatballs are your thing, you should check it out. I had the \"Saucy Balls\" and had four of the chicken meatballs with the government cheese over the Brussels sprouts. It was very good though the meatballs themselves were a little mediocre, everything else around them was great. Prices are reasonable though a little pricey when you consider how cheap meatballs are.",

When we can't decide where to go, Emporio is always a safe bet.   You have to get the meatballs here, no questions ask. Don't eat meat? Get a veggie meatball! There are so many options for sauces and gravies too, so no matter what meat or non-meat you get, you can make your meatballs perfect for you.  My personal go-to is beef meatballs with the mushroom gravy! The meatballs are pretty big so if you were to do meatballs alone for your meal, I would recommend 2 if you're peckish, 3 if you're pretty hungry, 4 if you're really hungry and 5 if you're \"starving\" or have a huge appetite!  The french fries are good, too!   Service is decent, but nothing spectacular. I love that you can run up the stairs to Il Tetto for cocktails after dinner, too.",

My coworkers and I decided to order practically every appetizer for our group of 10. Out of everything we ordered, the Parm Tater Tots and Buffalo Chicken Balls were my favorite. The tater tots were crispy and had a great flavor. The ranch sauce on the side perfectly adds to it as well. Buffalo Chicken Balls have a good amount of heat to them, but the sauce also had a sweet flavoring to it. Delicious combo of sweet and then a punch of spicy. I also really enjoyed the queso and cheesy bread sticks. I thought the crab dip was a bit lacking in crab taste and seasoning. It was also a cold dip, which I just expected it to be hot. Basically, you can't really go wrong with what you order here. You'll find something delicious to share, or even just for yourself.",

    "text": "It would be a lie if I told you I wasn't jealous of the brilliant mind that came up with a restaurant based on jazzed-up meatballs. Although I don't think you could eat here more than twice a month without clogging your arteries completely, it's one of the tastiest meals in Pittsburgh to enjoy once in a while.  My most recent visit to Emporio was my second so far, and both times it has been incredible. Deciding what to eat is always hard here because EVERYTHING looks like it would taste wonderful. There are pork, chicken, and beef meatballs, but what really makes this place a winner are vegan and vegetarian options! Who would have guessed a meatball place has a meatless meatball? Emporio's is made of mushrooms, white beans, and cauliflower and they do have a few vegan or veg sauces and sides as well. These are on my \"must try\" list.  The first time I was here was during November of 2016, and at the time they were featuring their Thanksgiving meatballs with mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing, etc. To a person that loves Thanksgiving food it was heavenly. Last week, I ordered the \"Angry Birds\" which are 2 chicken meatballs (massive meatballs, might I add), mac & cheese with the government cheese, \"crack sauce,\" and blue cheese crumbles to top it all off. My boyfriend got the featured meatloaf meatballs and got them \"Loaded Baked Potato\" style with potatoes, tater tots, bacon bits, and lots of delicious toppings.  The singular complaint that I had about my meal was the saltiness, but when I took my leftovers home and ate them with BBQ sauce on top the next day they were phenomenal. If I could add anything at all to the menu to make this place better, it'd be some Sweet Baby Ray's. You can swap sides like pasta or potatoes for green beans or Brussels sprouts, but it's rather difficult to turn away their mac & cheese.  Overall, Emporio has a unique but simple concept, the dining area was neat and well-kept, and the staff was incredibly friendly. I'll certainly be back once I feel I've worked off my last Emporio meal, and I'll be happily awaiting trying something new from the menu until then!",

The meatball was nothing special to me and even though I love shrimp, I thought the shrimp flavor in it tasted off.  But the poutine tots made up for it! With the cheese curds and gravy it was so indulgent but so tasty. The tots were still crispy.  Don't think the egg added anything so I would skip that next time.

I had the chicken and the beef meatball slider with various sauces on the side so I could try AND IT ALL TASTED LIKE NOTHING!! BLAND BLAND BLAND!  Beyond that our server asks if we want their ranch/hot sauce (WTF) combo on the side to dip fries in. My boyfriend says sure and when our food comes out his side sauce is considerably bigger than mine. Of course when the check comes we find out why, $1.50 charge! I'm not mad about the price but why would you present that and NOT mention that it's an additional charge...annoying.   No one at out table finished their food or took it home...",

    "text": "Meatball meatball, spaghetti underneath! I don't know many other meatball centric restaurants so I guess that means Emporio is my favorite. No matter how you style them - over sauce, in a panini, or as a slider - they're the perfect comfort food. The best thing about them is that you can easily customize the meatballs and poutine to your heart's content. I am in love with the veggie meatballs, however, sometimes they're a little heavy handed on the salt. Either way, they can't be beat. For vegetarians, the poutine with mushroom gravy is a must try! Outside of the Canadian border, this is quite possibly the best poutine I've had. On top of that, service is always great and employees can't be friendlier.",

Maybe there was a time(not for me) that having your female staff wear tee shirts with something suggestive on it was a good PR move, but that time is surely past.  This practice is/was for places with suspect food.  It's time to come up with more creative and less suggestive logos and marketing.  Balls doesn't cut it in the era of \"Me Too!\" Do better Emporio.  You are a better restaurant than this!   BTW there was nothing wrong with the service, at all.  Very attentive and fast!",

The spicy are definitely that but probably the best tasting. I was pleasantly surprised with the chicken as they had alot of flavor and weren't too dry. The beef were good but too firm and I think they were a bit dry. They were my least favorite. My husband got the spicy pork hoagie. It was huge and he wound up eating with a fork and knife. The arrabbiata sauce was very spicy but again very flavorful. The server was knowledgeable and very friendly. My only gripe is that the tables were a bit small and wobbly. I was afraid my drink would spill. Also while you could mix and match your balls, you could not sample different sauces. We will be back again to try tge different sauces!",

    "text": "My husband & I stumbled on this place looking for a place to eat downtown.  The energy was inviting when we walked through the door and we were immediately seated.  We were greeted by our server and given a full run down of the menu, since it was our first time.  I like that the menu had multiple options for the meatballs, you can choose between pork, chicken beef or veggie.  We decided to get a few apps and a drink.  The dip and bruschetta came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  Then came the crab balls & buffalo balls few minutes later. Overall, great experience-- friendly service & great food, so we would return.  Buffalo dip: Served cold.  At first I was thrown off because it was cold, but it was actually really good.  It had shrimp and crab pieces, with a nice thick texture.  They give you a good amount of dip,  but it does have a good amount of spice in it as well.  Bruschetta: 4 peices, Topped of with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, so it gave it a nice tangy touch.  The bread is toasted hard.  Crab balls:  5 balls, deep fried and seasoned well with sage.  They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I'm sure they added extra spice in these as well.  The cocktail sauce balanced the flavors.  Buffalo Balls:  One word, spicy.  They served 5 balls in a bowl with bleu cheese and lettuce.  The chicken ball itself is very, very spicy (I like spicy foods, my husband doesn't).  The sauce almost has a sweet, yet spicy kick, that is baked on.  They definitely awaken your taste buds.",

    "text": "I'm gonna be honest with you here for a moment.  When I heard \"meatball joint\" I immediately thought I will leave here hungry.  Welp, I was proven wrong.  The menu is rather small, yet big.  I know that sounds oxymoronic, but it aptly describes this modest menu.  Small in terms that it is just the front and back of a single page.  Big in terms that the options make it an endless mix and match that will take you multiple trips to try every option it has to offer.  Quick scan of the appetizers and I already knew I was getting the Crispy Pickle Chips.  You have me already at pickle, so why roam from what I know.  Serving it with a bacon ranch dip made it just the right amount of salt flavor.  There are enough in one serving of these that sharing is a must.  Definite hit for the table.  On to the main course.  I looked over the ball selections (I know, that sounds dirty, but it is what it is, ball selection) and I decided that, no, I don't want that, so my eyes go down to the 'Bowls' section.  For my money, this was the way to go.  Think KFC, but a hell of a lot better.  I went with the Loaded Baked Potato bowl.  It is not what it sounds like.  If you were to do a quick glance at it you would think that it was a literal baked potato in a bowl with meatballs.  Wrong.  This bowl's base is a wonderfully tasting white cheddar mashed potatoes.  It is a heaping portion too.  Then they lay two good sized beef meatballs on top of this potato-y fluff.  Mouthwatering beef meatballs I might add.  Then they douse all of that with 'government cheese.'  I'm not sure what is in that, but it is exactly what you would expect.  I wanted more of that.  Next, double the potato portion here, add tater tots.  Top with crumbled bacon and scallions.  When I finished this thing, I probably looked like Beast from 'Beauty and the Beast' when he was eating his soup.  I had that bowl up to my face attempting to get every last morsel from this bowl into my mouth.  So, yeah, I got full...from a meatball place.  I was totally proven wrong, and I am fine with that.",

The happy hour here from 4-6 PM includes half off drafts, $5 poutine and 50 cent buffalo chicken balls. Overall my friends and I enjoyed our meal and our server was great.

    "text": "I'm not really sure how to take this place.  First thing is first.   I love that it's a meatball place.   And it's different.   The food was all good but I don't think we were particularly blown away overall.   We would probably eat here again.  But with so many interesting other restaurant options to try, it might not be for a while.    We arrived at a good time.  Shortly before 5pm.  We were seated right away and it was nice weather so we sat at the open air seating to the outside.    The waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable.    She was patient with us as it was our first time and she had to explain some of the sauces.   The government cheese sauce is an American cheese sauce by the way and crack sauce is reportedly a ranch and hot sauce mix.     Anyway, we ordered the uncle kunkle crazy dip which was American cheese with meat sauce and scallions.  This stuff was phenomenal.  The meat sauce was amazing.  The only thing is there are either not enough dip or too many chips.   For our dinner mi amore ordered the loaded bowl with two beef meatballs, mashed potatoes, cheese sauce, tater tots, bacon, scallions.   He ordered two extra meatballs.  Be wise when doing this it's a lot of food and we could not finish it.    I ordered the fugga bout it bowl that had creamy parm noodles, meat sauce and two beef balls.   I think the parm noodles could have been more flavorful.  If I had to do it again I would have ordered those two balls with meat sauce over regular noodles or mashed potatoes.   Those mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing.    The meat sauce kept me coming back as well.  We ordered an extra chicken ball which we didn't like.   The beef balls were ok.  It was weird because they were just so perfect and had the texture of say a frozen ball.  But, alas, they say they make them fresh.    They tasted good as well, but to me sometimes they tasted homemade sometimes frozen.   They were edible though.    Other notables were the manager walked around and talked with patrons which was nice.   The environment was endearing and comfortable as well.    All in all not blown away but it was good.",

I liked this bowl a lot because to me it seemed like a good twist on the classic spaghetti and meatballs.   The chicken meatballs were great, had good flavor and were pretty big. I enjoyed the creamy Parmesan penne and the meat sauce was a good addition. I was surprised that it ended up being more food than I could eat, it was very filling. I can't wait to go back, there were so many options to choose from and they all look so good!   We had a big group, 7 people, and the service was great. Our waitress was nice and attentive. We were all struggling to decide on what we wanted and she gave lots of suggestions and was patient while we went through the menu. Overall good experience!",

Not sure if that was worth it because there wasn't much given. All my colleagues had bowls too (not the sauce bowl w/ meatballs) and the portions are just so small. So it comes out to be pretty pricey. Still good meatballs.   Vibe is casual, they have a bar so it's pretty hip. I would definitely go back if it's work related and we want to go somewhere casual. I think it's a pretty safe choice because everyone can have what they want.",

You pick they \"style\" you want your balls; saucy (sauce on balls), hoagie (sauce on balls in bun), panini (balls pressed in panini, sauce on side for dipping), or slider (ball with sauce on bun). All choices can come with cheese if you want - your choice - and you can also get little extras added like dill pickle chips. I really liked the place, and i didn't mind having to wait since they allow you to leave your phone number so you can go have a couple drinks somewhere else and wait. If you want something more fancy Italian-style - just go upstairs!",

    "text": "I came to Pittsburgh to visit some of my friends for the weekend. They suggested we go try this place.  At first, they said it was a meatball place so it didn't expect much from it. The first thing I noticed when walking in was a 3 floor restaurant. I've only been on the first and third floor, the first floor is normal restaurant. But the third floor, which is only accessible thru the elevator on the first floor is a beer garden which is really cool.   The food here was good and overwhelming. I gotten the spicy pork meatball with cheese rigatoni for myself and the rest of us shared a bunch of appetizers. We gotten the cheese dip, buffalo shrimp and crab dip, Brussels sprouts, poutine, pickle chips, and cheesy bread.   The cheese rigatoni was good, the meatball was pretty good but not anything that special. But the appetizers were almost all outstanding. The only one I don't recommend is the buffalo dip, it's like standard buffalo dip and nothing special at all.   Overall I like this place, it's good and different but I would probably come this place on a rare occasion. The third floor beer garden is awesome and would definitely come back for that. I would come if you love meatballs and carbs. And lastly I think some of this is a little overprice, but it is downtown Pittsburgh.",

I've now probably been here about 10 times and every time has been delicious.  The nice thing is they have different types of meatballs and different preparation options. They have regular, chicken and vegetarian to name a few. Then they have different types of sauces like Parmesan, gravy and marinara. Your next decision is how you would like your meatballs. In a bowl on pasta, sliders, and paninis are a few options.   I always stick to the chicken meatball with marinara on a slider. Then I have had side dishes of gnocchi, Mac n cheese and hash browns. These have all been soo good!! I have to say I was not a fan of the veggie meatball though, it was very mushy and tasted like peas to me. I'll stick to chicken!  Not to mention the prices are very fair and you leave very full! Be sure to check out the meatball of the month. In December it was a turkey meatball with stuffing and cranberry mixed in (I forget what else) topped with gravy. One of my favorite meatballs ever!",

The spicy pork is the best meatball in my opinion, and with creamy parm sauce it makes a pretty good combo. I usually get that combo as a hoagie. I've tried the tot poutine, the panini, and a few other items, but the humble meatball hoagie is the surest bet.   The happy hour is a real deal though, 1/2 off drafts and wines. I think generally the beers are a little expensive but at happy hour they're a bit of a steal.",

    "text": "For a place that says it specializes in meatballs they really don't have good meatballs - they are average at best.  We tried the pork meatball, beef meatball and vegetarian meatball along with the side salad. Although I did enjoy the flavor of the sauce on the pork meatball as well as the marinara sauce on the beef meatball the actual flavor of the individual meatballs without the sauce was not good. Without the sauce, the beef meatball was probably the best of the three meatballs but even that meatball was not as good as most other beef meatballs I've had. Although I loved the sauce on the pork meatball I would not recommend the actual meatball. The vegetable meatball was the least appetizing both in texture and flavor. The texture was pasty and the flavor was bland. The texture of the pork and beef meatball, on the other hand, was reminiscent of frozen meat balls and did not resemble the texture of hand made meatballs. I also felt that the meatballs were too heavy and big - I couldn't even finish a single meatball and could only have a couple small bites of each one.   The side salad was mediocre although the salad dressing served with the salad, which was a sweet balsamic, was tasty and helped to mask the flavor of the meatballs which by themselves did not have a good flavor.",

    "text": "Oh, man.  Meatballs.  Meatballs as far as the eye can see.  My sister recommended Emporio while Jules and I were on a recent trip back to Pittsburgh.  She and her husband frequented the Wexford Emporio location, but it just so happened that the downtown location was just a few blocks away from the National Aviary, which was Jules' biggest target for this trip back to da 'Burgh.  As such, a lunch date at Emporio was on the cards.  And wow.  Just wow.    Emporio was fairly busy on a Friday at lunch hour, though we were seated immediately with no fuss.  Our waiter was cordial and walked us through Emporio's numerous meatball and sauce varieties with a practiced ease.  We elected to share a basket of pepperoni fritters, while I opted for a classic beef panini (with the tomato basil cream sauce), and Jules chose the meatball poutine, made with the monthly special lamb meatballs and mushroom gravy.  My panini was done just the way it should be; crisp, pressed flat with just the right amount of char, molten cheese, and meatballs that must have been pressed by a legion of heavenly Italian grammas.  My sauce was dead on, playing second fiddle only to The Twisted Sicilian food truck, out in Indianapolis.  Plus, the panini was just the right size--filling, but not to the point where I was bursting.  The big highlight for me, though?  Those pepperoni fritters.  Damned if I'm not going to be trying to replicate that recipe, cheesy and crispy-fried, then rolled in Parmesan as they came out of the fryer.  Utterly brilliant.  Jules was brought out a bowl of poutine that I knew she'd never be able to finish and, while the meatball was delicious and the fries could have come straight out of Kennywood's Potato Patch, my suspicions were pretty well confirmed:  for a poutine, you really want a 'drippy' meat--Italian roast beef, braised short rib, or something similar.  A 'dry' protein like a meatball, even when covered with delectable gravy, just doesn't cut it.  Delicious, but not quite among the best poutines we've had.  Regardless of that, I know I'll be finding my way back to Emporio.  There's just so much goodness on that menu that I'll be hunting down a seat at lunch anytime I'm in downtown Pittsburgh.",

Their menu lists meatballs of all different flavors and styles?! I didn't even know you could enjoy meatballs in so many different fashions. Just like the decor and ambiance of this place, the menu is just as fun. I was placing a to-do order for my family, and as we wanted to try as many different flavors as possible we went with the sliders.

I did a lot of research on the area, as I do whenever we travel to a new place! We are foodies and love to try new places. Emporio (meatball joint) intrigued me with their unique concept featuring various meatballs and interesting sauces. We love the \"create your own dish\" idea and I personally was so excited to try the place. Saturday evening, our last night here, was our night to try the place. And we did. Unfortunately we did not dine in for several factors; parking in the city, meeting up with friends, etc. So we ordered take out and it was delivered to the hotel.  We order Buffalo Fried Chicken Balls (Snacky Things), Fuggetta-Bowl-It! and  two (2) Loaded Baked Potato bowls. The presentation for delivery was very nice and food was warm in temp. But the Buffalo chicken balls were so spicy (and I like Spicy things) I couldn't eat them. It was terrible. Menu says they come with Bleu cheese dressing  & celery  BUT I received a little pile of chopped lettuce. But to top it all off no silverware was offered or in the bag. We are in a hotel with no silverware. Unfortunately we don't have any so we had to eat with our fingers.  Our hotel doesn't have a restaurant open now just has a continental b'fast. The man working at the front was busy and couldn't go on a silverware hunt as it was locked up on another floor. PLEASE PUT SILVERWARE IN TOU TOG",

    "text": "My friends and I visited this restaurant seeking refuge from the cold and for a Friday afternoon, it was crowded! We were able to get seating in the bar area and service was great and efficient. For food, we ordered the Fugetta-Bowl-It! vegetarian style (arrabbiata instead of meat sauce, veggie meatballs), a veggie meatball panini with mushroom gravy, and a chicken meatball panini with basil pesto cream. The Fugetta-Bowl-It! was delicious and the staff was kind enough to accommodate all our dietary restrictions. Overall, lunch was filling and satisfying- I will probably return to Emporio because of the unique concept!  PS: Not in the mood for meatballs? That's okay! There are multiple floors to the restaurant, each serving something different. You can try something else or try them all!",

Now my only ball option is the chicken, but again, thankful it's offered. I usually pair it with the rocket salad, but this time opted for the tomato risotto and it was delicious! I think because I also added a creamy parm sauce to the mix, so I was really going for it this time!   I also LOVE their fries! I always have to order them, even if I'm trying to be \"heathy\" it's a total weakness! They have a decent beer, wine and cocktail list too.   One thing to note is that they took themselves off the wait list function and I'm bummed about that! I loved having that option and it has made me NOT want to go here at times I expected them to be busier. I think it works against them to not be on it. Not sure what the reasoning behind going off it was?   Regardless, happy to pop in on the \"off\" hours and enjoy some balls and fries!",

We came here on a Thursday night. We managed to snag the last half of happy hour (4-6). We got half of drafts (or wine), and $0.50 buffalo chicken bites. We decided to get 8 of them. At the time, we didn't know what a standard order was/ how big they were. OK first off, they are HOT. I was not prepared. We ordered 8 but definitely should've gotten 4 or 5.. 8 was too many. We powered through it!  Next is you pick a meatball. You pick how you want it (on a hoagie, bowl, etc), then what type of meat (chicken, beef, etc), then any sauce/ cheese. I chose a panini with chicken meatballs, provolone and basil pesto sauce.   The food came out really fast. I was kind of confused why my sauce was on the side, I wish it had came on the actual food. But this was a monster to eat! I barely finished mine. My boyfriend made it through half of a hoagie before he tapped out.   Such a fun concept! Quick, good service, great food, and the shirts were awesome. Definitely coming here again!",

Tendy, juicy, but cooked through. They were flavorful on their own, but the basil pesto sauce took it to the next level. I almost felt like doing an old school Emeril Lagasse \"BAM!!\"  Crispy parm brussels sprouts made for the perfect side. They were crunchy and the parm cheese flavor paired well with the meatballs.  Service was excellent. Would def come back the next time I'm in Pitt.",

I went with my girlfriend around 9 and it was relatively empty. I say relatively because while there were multiple filled tables they had an impressive amount of seating available which would definitely come in handy during busier hours. Our waiter was very helpful and not too pushy (as some waiters can get while a resturaunt is nearing close).   As for the food, it seems as though they have something for everyone, even offering a vegetarian meatball option. I went with a classic meatball sub style hoagie with marinara and parmesan cheese and it was amazing, the meatballs were a good size and, although I had some trouble eating it, we're worth the struggle! My girlfriend got a bowl of 4 chicken balls which were nicely topped with the pesto sauce she chose. We split an order of cheesy bread which was amazing as well.   All in all, I loved my time here and really enjoyed the food. I will definitely be coming back soon to see what other meatball combinations I can come up with!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to visit the restaurants in Sienna Mercato for quite some time now and last night I decided it was time. I thought the idea of a restaurant centered around meatballs was unique so I just had to go to Emporio. We went late at night so the place wasn't busy, but there was a decent amount of people still there. We were seated in no time. The decor of the place was very hipster and cool. All of the staff had on shirts that had some sort of \"meatball humor\" on them. I was very entertained.   As for food and drinks, they had a really good beer list but I may be biased because they carried one of my favorite beers (Victory Golden Monkey). The food selections were great, there's definitely something for everyone. They have a nice list of appetizers. We ended up ordering the cheesy bread and it was delicious. The marinara sauce that came with it was to die for. I also saw that they serve poutine. I didn't order it but I might have to in the future because it was hard to resist.   The meatball selection though... wow. You can choose from various kinds. They had beef, spicy pork, vegetarian, and chicken. They also had a special meatball of the month which at this time was chicken piccata. They have different ways they can be served too. You can get just meatballs by themselves, a meatball hoagie, panini, and even meatball sliders. I wasn't expecting this type of variety so it was a pleasant surprise. With your meatballs, you then can pick from an array of sauces. I ended up choosing the basil pesto cream and it was to die for with the chicken meatballs. Additionally, you can order sides to go with them. I decided to try the parmesan Brussels sprouts which were fantastic.   The only warning I have, which isn't a bad warning, is that all of the food is very rich and fills you up quickly. So, you'll have plenty to take home and eat later!",

But after going I realized I was mistaken.  My usual go to is the regular meatball with the parmesan sauce, over top of the seasoned fries.  If I am only going for lunch I will stick to the panini or sliders, because the saucy balls is a lot of food.  They also have a meatball of the month which I usually like to try in slider form.  The best one I have ever had was the Buffalo chicken and I hope they bring it back eventually.  Aside from the good at sienna, there is a rooftop bar which is a great happy hour spot.",

This was my first time at Emporio so I didn't know what to expect, so I ordered a little bit of everything. I ordered 4 meatballs with 4 sauces so I could sample one of each.   Let's start with the pros: *The poutine fries get a solid 5 stars! They are a must have for sure! *my husband got the matzo ball soup and it was delicious as well! I would also suggest that!  *the side salad was very fresh and a nice portion.  * the November meatball of the month is a turkey dinner all in a meatball! It had ground turkey, cranberries, and stuffing. Very good stuff! The bowl option was served with mashed potatoes and corn. The potatoes were just okay in my opinion.  * the beef meatballs were definitely the best of the 4 I tried. It paired nicely with the spicy marinara sauce.   Okay, now the cons: * I hate that they don't take reservations. They do use the No Wait app, but I still had to wait almost 30 mins upon my arrival. And there is no where to wait inside.  * this space is crammed to the max!! Like, it might be a fire hazard. I had strangers on both sides of me and our elbows were almost touching. Please don't come here on a romantic date lol.  * the service is not fantastic. But I think it's because there are way too many people in the building. The staff: customer ratio is way off, but that's a management issue.  * the chicken meatball was just gross and the \"crack sauce\" was even more gross. Tastes like cheap cafeteria food.  * I also didn't like the spicy pork meatball. My husband liked it though.   In conclusion... my husband the avid meatball connoisseur said he would return to Emporio. Personally, I don't think I'll be back.",

We all mixed different mb preparations varying from traditional pasta to sandwiches, they're nice size, 4 mb is plenty per person. Nice beer selection, both draft and bottled. Great having an open air deck which made for a comfortable couple of hours.",

I sat at the bar for both of my visits.  They were really just but was waited on in a reasonable time.  Big selection of draft beer so I was already set!    How could you not like a menu of all meatballs! I got a bowl which you get 4 balls of your choice and you can also mix and match .  I got 2 chicken and 2 lamb (which was the ball of the month for September) with marinara sauce.  They came out really fast (assuming they are all made already and just heated to go out).  I could of used more sauce but the balls were still awesome!",

When we couldn't decide quickly, his demeanor changed to blunt and unpleasant. He acted kind of off put that we didn't want an appetizer or beer. He also took the water to refill it and never returned it.   The food was alright. Salad was good, but just a normal salad, nothing special. The vegetable ball had good flavor, a mild falafel flavor. The ball of the month was sauerkraut with pork, the flavor of it was good, but nothing special. For the price, I think there are better options.  I wish they had a bowl option that was a little healthier, something like mixed seasonal vegetables with balls. I feel like all of their bowls are very heavy.",

Not many places were open when we came across Emporio.  I was somewhat skeptical of a meatball restaurant, but we went in anyway.  Loved the open air concept, the cleanliness and the service.  I had the City of Champyinz (great self deprecating humor) and loved it.  Meatballs, spaghetti with chicken chile and scallions (nice touch for a little crunch).  Never thought about spaghetti with chile, but I do now.  So much so that I think I'm going to have to cook up some chile for my spaghetti!    Too bad I'm a long way from Pittsburgh and can't easily swing by for some meatballs until our next Steeler game.",

The third time our server had no knowledge of the menu, forgot to apply the advertised discount to our bill, rushed us on ordering and laughed when one of our party pronounced a wine wrong. Oh and something else kind of important, we got food poisoning from the meatballs. Apparently after asking around I found this is common with them these days. And when I called management to leave a message (figuring they'd want to know so they could fix their food) I got and answering machine and no one followed up on my message. Been burned too many times. Food is delicious but not worth all the bad.",

My only complaint is that happy hour is either confusing or they didn't ring it in right and the space is crowded. A few less tables would do wonders for the space.

Fries tasted like they had sat under a lamp for two days. The veg and regular meatballs were extremely salty. A big turn off. They got rid of the tzatziki sauce, which was my favorite.  They changed the pesto sauce into some weird creamy substance that looks like pureed guacamole, but more watery.  The only good thing was that the service was up to speed.  I would only go here if I needed to meet for beer or something now. Another major flaw on their \"wedge\" salad...They serve it in a small metal bowl.  It is impossible to eat since it needs to be cut up.  I literally sat there looking at it wondering how I was supposed to get it in my mouth.  I tried cutting it and the bowl would roll around and spill all over the table.  Straight knives do not cut easily on curved surfaces.  I wanted to bring the chef out and have him try to eat it in front of me.  I am all done with this place, maybe Mezzo still decent?",

The paninis or bowls are perfect for a medium to large lunch, and I've never gotten a bad combination there. Spicy pork with the crack sauce is my go-to, and the sauce lives up to its name. It's a good punch of flavor that keeps me ordering it again and again.  The sides are every bit as good, with deliciously crisp and tender tater tots if you're feeling like grease, but I can't recommend the brussels sprouts enough. Sprouts have become a big deal in recent years and Emporio's are crispy, with the right amount of char and the parmesan gives it just the right amount of saltiness.    Each month there's a specialty ball that I'll get more often than not, and it's usually okay at worst and delicious as best. If you're downtown it's a good one to add into the rotation.",

Plenty of seating, and a text-to-let-you-know-when-your-table-is-ready-system if there's a wait.   Food. I like the food at Emporio. I like to get the Saucy Balls (yes, kids can come to this restaurant). I order 4 different meatballs - usually the beef, pork, chicken, and the special of the month. I like to get the crack sauce and a side of Mac and cheese with the government cheese. My wife likes to get the meatball panini with chicken meatballs, smoked gouda (it is sooo \"gouda\"), and a side of crispy parm Brussels sprouts (honestly, these sprouts are killer good). AND if you're particularly hungry...you should get a side of Parmesan-herb French fries as you wait. It's massive and delicious.

Isaac from Emporio personally called and apologized for this delay (even though it was out of their control). He said they would remake our food so that we did not receive cold food that had been left sitting there for a long amount of time. We received our food two hours after ordering, but thankfully it was fresh and warm because Emporio was willing to scrap the first order free of charge and remake it for us. Great service and will definitely continue to eat at this restaurant because of the great customer service and delicious food!",

We were extremely thankful for such great service. We were sat promptly at our reservation time, and they were pretty busy so it took a while for us to get our drinks. We ordered pretty quickly, and the food came out fast. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. I got a beef meatball slider with the tomato basil sauce (highly recommend this sauce) and a wedge salad. The salad wasn't bad, but it was VERY difficult to cut in the bowl they served it in. I'd much rather have preferred it on a plate. It was almost more work than it was worth. Either way, everyone seemed very pleased with their food and I've never been disappointed in my previous visits. Their draft list is extensive and varied, and they make sure to point out the local beers on tap. They brought out little cake balls with some cream cheese \"sauce\" on it with a candle in it for each of the birthday girls. It is definitely a fun atmosphere with a unique food theme.",

    "text": "Stopped for dinner on the way to a concert at the Benedum. The location is great, downtown in the Cultural District on Penn Ave. The restaurant is on the first floor of Sienna Mercado and has a nice open layout with a huge garage-door/window that opens right on to Penn Ave. When the weather is nice, it creates a perfect after-work/happy hour atmosphere.   But enough about restaurant design, let's talk balls. Meatballs that is. They're the focus of the restaurant and they're delicious. I ordered the Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-a-Ball! Bowl which comes with two of their spicy pork balls, cheese tortellini arrabbiata, and jalapenos tossed in their spicy sauce. Do not underestimate the spice of this one. I love spicy food and these were absolutely fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the dish is fiery! The sauce and tortellini were great, but the meatballs were truly outstanding. They were full of flavor, have a great texture, and are very large! I cut each meatball into quarters to spread the love around my bowl and because there's no way you're eating these balls in less than four bites!  I was also able to try a few bites of the classic beef meatballs and they were also delicious. Emporio packs a lot of flavor and love into each meatball, and it shows!  The only thing I didn't love was the price. My bowl was $13 and came with two meatballs, which honestly would be fine if there was a little more pasta. You can double your meatballs for $4 but $17 is steep for a pasta and meatballs, especially in Pittsburgh. Overall, still worth it, I will definitely be back. Maybe during one of their many happy-hour specials which seemed fantastic! During the week from 4-6 all drinks are half off and buffalo chicken balls are 50 cents.  TLDR: Great atmosphere, incredible meatballs, go during the happy hour!",

    "text": "The venue is a bit confusing because it says Sienna Mercato on the outside. I had to check Google Maps to find out that Emporio was indeed on the inside. Better signage would help. The dining area is a bar-like scene, too noisy and dark for my taste but probably somewhat trendy to most folks.  The menu is pretty interesting. Basically, pick your meatballs, pick a sauce, and pick something on which to put the meatballs. I had french fry poutine with a spicy pork meatball on top. Menu prices seemed a tad upscale but may be fine for downtown Pittsburgh. However, I didn't think the food itself was all that remarkable once you get past the novelty.  Service was a bit spotty. They don't pay equal attention to every table, so when it was time to leave, it took us a while to get our checks.",

    "text": "Very fun place :) The menu is well set up and easy to follow - seems to be able to cater to many tastes! Came here with two friends before seeing a show at the Benedum on a weeknight. We were able to be seated relatively quickly and the service was quick. Our only complaint was how dim the lighting was in the area - we were in the back near the elevators, and needed some extra lighting just to see the menu. Eventually, our eyes adjusted and we placed our orders. I ordered the spicy meatballs over tortellini, one friend got the meatballs over mac & cheese, and another decided on two meatballs over tots with crack sauce.  The food arrived very quickly and we were able to dig in! The meatballs were a pretty good size and had great flavor. Between the three of us, we were able to try the pork and chicken meatballs and enjoyed both types. I enjoyed how the menu allows each person to customize the dish to their liking. The tortellini, mac & cheese, & tots were all prepared well and extremely filling. Given that we were about to go sit through a show, we didn't want to be too full, but the serving size seemed very adequate for a hearty meal.",

The decor of the restaurant is however very modern with a soho style hipster vibe",

    "text": "A lot to like about Emporio. The open air atmosphere makes it a perfect spot on a nice summer night. This is my 2nd trip here and I wanted to ensure the 1st wasn't a fluke before I reviewed it. Thankfully, it was not a fluke.   For a starter, my wife and I split the poutine with gravy-- arguably the best part of the meal. It was outstanding! I opted for the meatball of the month which was the stuffed pepper meatball which I got served on a grinder. Really good and flavorful. I got mac n cheese with parmesan cheese as my side at it was definitely the weakest point of the meal, but still ok.   My wife got a traditional beef meatball over tortellini and she all good things to say about it.   A great beer and wine selection to compliment the great food makes Emporio a must visit for me.",

He looked through and saw this and I love meatballs so we figured we'd give it a shot. How can you possibly pass up a joint that has balls written all over the place, LOL. Our waiter was Chandler and he was great. He explained the menu since it was our first time, was patient and even made suggestions. I got two sliders and a penne bowl and my boyfriend got the fuggetta bowl.  Both were delicious.  Unfortunately we were only in town for two nights otherwise I would've loved to return. It's a shame we live five hours away. For dessert Chandler recommended the doughnut balls, OMG delicious. Highly recommend.",
