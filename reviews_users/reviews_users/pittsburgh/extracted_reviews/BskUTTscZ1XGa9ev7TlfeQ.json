    "text": "One word: Underwhelmed. My fellow Pittsburghers, stopped being impressed by a cool ambiance and let's get back to what really matters.  With that, I'll say the ambiance is cool. It's connected to Hotel Monaco and from the little portion of that hotel that I got to see, it looks unique, artsy, and fun. The Commoner has played along well with this. It was a bit loud, like most new Pittsburgh restaurants.   The service was okay, wasn't exactly service with a smile. He did a terrible job explaining and selling meals that we questioned what they entailed.  For the food... um, why did we pay that much for such mediocre American food? Oh, because it's a new restaurant downtown that has an interesting ambiance. The bread tasted stale, defiantly not fresh. The crab shells and cheese was so bland, lacking flavor. Now there were nice big chunks of crab, but where was the cheesey flavor goodness? Not there. Lastly, I had the scottish salmon. It was okay, a bit undercooked for my liking (not that they asked how I'd like it prepared) and due to a theater showtime, just ate it and moved on.   Needless to say, with all the excellent restaurants in Pittsburgh we won't be back. Maybe for drinks, because the bar looked like it could be a much better experience.",

Caesar salad was okay - but something I could make at home. Nice vinaigrette but the anchovies described on the menu were noticeably absent. Lamb special was perfect. But desert - their famed sticky toffee pudding was awful. The texture told me it was microwaved and for too long.   I wouldn't recommend it. Other better food to be enjoyed in Pittsburg.",

    "text": "I expected wonderful things from this restaurant, and was sorely disappointed. Visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend and wanted to take my guest somewhere more unique than Market Square- I am regretting my decision.  The hostesses were very friendly-though we didn't have reservations, and the restaurant was nearing the end of brunch and was fairly empty, we were given the option of the bar table or the chef's table. We sat at the high top and watched as two other groups that came in after us and sat at the bar tables had their drink orders and food orders in before us.   Once we ordered, our food came out fairly quickly, but our waiter disappeared without giving us time to ask for more coffee. He did not come back until we were finished eating, though he stopped several times to make sure the single blonde girl at the table next to us had all the water she could ask for.  I got the bacon beni, which had two hard boiled eggs instead of runny ones, and some very greasy potatoes on the side. I know I didn't sign up for a healthy breakfast, but this was really disappointing. My guest got the mess beni, which she didn't eat much of due to it's greasiness.  I wish our waiter had bothered to stop and ask how everything was so I could be reviewing the restaurant's great customer service, but no one asked why we sent away two plates of half eaten food.   Oh well.",

    "text": "I have been here several times and I have had a mixed bag of results.   First the food. Each time I have gone I have really enjoyed the appetizers I have ordered. The scotch/deviled eggs are a True treat. So much flavor and so decadent. The beef tartare with the poached quail yolk was simply amazing. I could have eaten that all day. The meat plate and cheese plates respectively change up, and have been from average to very good with the selections. If I were only rating this I'd have said 4-5 stars.   I have in general been less enamored with the salads and entrees I have had. Going last night they had completely changed the menu, so almost everything was new except for a few staples (the French Onion burger etc). First off the bar was missing several beer selections that were on the menu still. Not a deal breaker, but annoying. For my entrees, I had the root vegetable with goat cheese. I ordered this because I love goat cheese, which played nicely with the vegetables, though, it was a little much for my tastes. If you are a fan or beets, carrots and turnips it is quite good. I then got the Short Ribs which came with a gastrique and sour cream mashed potatoes. This entire was good but not great. I tend to think that braised meat is done more than I like in general and this was no different. It was pull apart tender, but a little on the dry side. More sauce could have helped. We also ordered family style sides which were nothing special. Again, good but not great. I was excited by the duck fat friend potato wedges, but they were under-seasoned. The food was good, and I would not have a problem going back, it just wasn't enough to blow me away.  My biggest complaint though about The Commoner though is the overall noise level. It is extremely loud to the point it is hard to converse with the other side of your table or even talk to the server. If you are going for a business dinner (like I most recently was), I'd suggest going elsewhere in that case.",

The ambiance and decor were fabulous -- I loved the burnished mirror with a historical map of Pittsburgh overlay. The lighting and low-noise level make it a great spot for date night or a catch-up dinner with friends. Would definitely go back!",

Having been for dinner, lunch and brunch before, we are huge fans of The Commoner. This weekend we met friends for dinner for the first time with the new chef at the helm and while everything was great, it was no where near as amazing as our previous trips.   We began with a few starters - the scotch eggs, devils on horseback and crab fritters. The scotch eggs with the homemade hot sauce were a favorite of ours, but we were disappointed to hear they no longer make the homemade sauce and this time the sausage was dry and the eggs were slightly green. I probably wouldn't order them again. The crab fritters were average and didn't really have much crab in them. I ordered the short rib for my entree and it was the best part of the meal. It was very tender and flavorful. A friend had the scallops and said they were amazing.   Overall, we had a great night because we were dining with friends, but we certainly didn't leave blown away by our meals, as we have in the past. I do hope the kitchen can find their footing again, because I love the Kimpton brand, it's a great place to come for cocktails and I especially love the Beirgarten in the warmer months.",

My friends had some appetizers and seemed to really enjoy the mussels. My husband ordered a few different appetizers as his meal and I will say that the pretzel was one of the best I have ever tasted.  I ordered the chicken entree and really enjoyed it. It was a well balanced dish and a good portion. I would have really liked some bread to soak up the sauce, but that wasn't offered.   I really liked the look of the restaurant and the atmosphere was great. Hopefully the service improves.",

Appetizers: Scampi & Chips - 3 huge shrimp which were fried and very tender served with a handful of waffle fries. It was good, I would order that again. We also had the Roots & Tubers appetizer - it was okay, nothing special. I wouldn't order it again.  Entree - Onion Soup Burger - this was just okay. It was filling but REALLY lacked flavor. It came with french fries which our server said take 3 days to make. I ate a few with their homemade ketchup and wasted the rest. There was nothing special about them. My friend had the skirt steak which he enjoyed.  Service - our waiter was friendly enough but not that attentive. He came back to the table a few times but never offered to refill my soda so I had to ask him. He would stand around talking to other waiters near the bar when we needed plates cleared, refills, etc. He was good at explaining items on the menu, though he recommended the burger I had and it was lackluster.  I would not plan to come back to this establishment because I was really underwhelmed and for the money we spent we could have had a meal that I KNOW would have been amazing closer to the cultural district at Butcher & the Rye or the like.",

They also do a great job with craft cocktails and I liked the vibe/service at this modern American tavern!  I returned the evening of 6/27 to check out the new menu at The Commoner.  I tried the Bruleed Corn appetizer.  I found the corn to taste scorched in that cute mini frying pan.  I also tried the Lamb Shank. It was way too large a portion for one person. It was Flintstone size.  The meat fell off the bone, but was so rich.  I found the vegetables that accompany it was literally the best part.  I told my server I wouldn't order either item again.",

I was expecting the same experience last night, but was blown away by the improvement in our meals. Everything we ordered was so good and we all made the same comment about how much better the food is now. We tried the duck drumettes, beef tartare, scallops, and the scotch egg. The scotch egg came in a tomato sauce and was the best I've ever had. The beef tartare came on a perfect, long, salty cracker and had incredible flavor. I highly recommend those two as starters. The duck drumettes had an Asian sesame flavor that we both enjoyed. The scallops were also great, but it would have been nice to have a fourth scallop. I think three was a bit stingy. They had a delicious acidic flavor with a few black rice cakes and crunchy Asian vegetables. My friends appeared to love their salmon and chicken dishes as much as I enjoyed mine.   However, the $14 beer was pretty ridiculous in my opinion and the cocktails were just okay. For $14, I expected a giant boot full of beer, not a 16 ounce draft. Aside from that, I'll definitely return.",

The service was great for the most part--the waitress came to our table very often and filled up our water in addition to replacing our silverware after the appetizer was finished; however it took almost 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. After our appetizer came out, our food came out within 10 minutes so we didn't get to finish the appetizer before our dinner came. I had the primavera pasta and I was expecting it to be more of a creamy sauce than what it was. The green beans in the pasta seemed slightly undercooked. It was tasty but definitely not as great as I had expected. My friend got the scotch egg and the breading was soggy and seemed like it had been sitting in the sauce for too long which is why it was soggy and not served fresh. We also got the toffee pudding dessert and that was phenomenal. Overall the taste was good but not as great as expected and the app took an extremely long time to come out considering the fact that there weren't that many people there.",

There was nothing really that exciting on the menu. I ended up ordering the crab Benedict, and a Bloody Mary from the DIY Bloody Mary bar. The crabmeat was not good quality and there wasn't much flavor to the dill hollandaise sauce. The side of potatoes also lacked flavor. The Bloody Mary bar is average, and not worth fifteen dollars for one drink. I also felt that the staff was lacking hospitality, especially during a time that wasn't that busy. I spent over $40 on breakfast and did not enjoy the food, drinks or the experience. There is also very little street parking so I had to pay an additional $6 to park in a garage. Just not worth the money.",

    "text": "I was visiting Pittsburgh from New York, and the passenger sitting next to me on the plane recommended The Commoner as one of her top places to eat. I am a huge foodie myself, and basically travel to try what each city has to offer so I put it at the top of my MUST TRY list.   I stopped by on Saturday night for a drink and to catch up with a girlfriend. The ambiance was lively and full of people. Although the place was busy, especially with an upcoming Penguins & Flyers game, we were able to grab a couple seats at the bar. The venue is huge, but we were able to maintain conversation without competing with the environment. BIG PLUS, we had a pleasant conversation with the manager Seth & head chef Wyatt, who took the time to stop by and check in on our restaurant experience. We were impressed by their proactive approach to customer service, it added a personal touch to the restaurant and made the entire experience more intimate despite the crazy hustle and bustle of a Saturday night.    BOOZE  The Clifford Ball - tequila base w/citrus aftertaste, the black currant sea salt foam definitely adds an extra layer of complexity to the taste and some flair!   Signed, Sealed, Delivered - smooth bourbon based cocktail, not too sweet nor too strong   Turducken - duck-fat washed wild turkey bourbon, with a rubber chicken to top it off! Loved the garnish on this cocktail & the apple brandy pairing    FOOD  Short Rib Mac: I am obsessed with mac and cheese, and will order it 90% of the time when I see it on a menu. This one did not disappoint! It was rich, decadent and creamy with pieces of short rib mixed in and topped with breadcrumbs and an EGG! We broke the yolk & mixed it all together - we destroyed it in less than five minutes. It'll cost me on the treadmill later, but no regrets.    Beef Tartare: We loved the rare steak + mushrooms + eggs combination. It literally melted in my mouth! Large sized portion - can feed up to four as an appetizer - make sure to ask for extra bread.   Thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Commoner & would definitely return. From the carefully curated cocktails to the drool-worthy food and the superb service, five stars all around!!!",

We got there at about 8PM on a Saturday and didn't fit in with the hip urban crowd -- not a problem, I was looking for good food and drink. I couldn't be happier with the cocktail menu which had quite a few unique concoctions. I don't remember my first drink, but it was tequila based with a hint of pineapple. Quite mild and refreshing for a warm summer night. I also had the Herb Your Enthusiasm, another wonderful job by the mixologist. My son had the burger, my mother had the chicken and I had the salmon. All were prepared to perfection --- the mashed potatoes with the chicken were out of this world. My son had dessert that he gobbled down quite quickly. The service was attentive without being overbearing. My only quibble was that the noise didn't dissipate in the space so it could be quite hard to hear. If I'm passing through Pittsburgh again, I'd certainly stop by at minimum for one of their inventive cocktails.",

My husband ordered the strip steak (medium) and it was cooked perfectly.   The hostess was incredibly sweet and despite having a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday evening, she suggested places we could go in the hotel to have a drink and texted us when the table was ready.   The only negative (and reason for only 4 stars) is that the service was very slow. Once we were seated we waited for quite a long time for drinks and then for over an hour for our food. The waiter was really busy and not very attentive.   We would definitely come again.... just with the time set aside knowing we might be there for awhile!",

Lighting is soft and you are greeted by the delicious smells emanating from the kitchen.  There is no shortage of seating options - shared family style and individual high-top, lower round, booth, bar as well as chef observation tables.    Consistent with some of the new bars popping up, they have beer, wine and cocktails on tap. Interesting, each wine is kept at a different temperature and oxygenated to a different percentage.  Unfortunately, there's no happy hour but the atmosphere and drink selections make up for it.  Diverse menu selection with a English Pub focus.  Highly recommend the liver mousse, steak and ale pie and the toffee pudding.  I can still taste the toffee pudding -- sweet, decadent, gooey deliciousness!   Five gold stars to John, our server!  He was attentive, well informed and more than happy to answer all our questions. He chatted to us about the temperature and oxygenation of the wines and briefed us on how we could easily make the steak and ale pie ourselves - detailing the ingredients and giving a short 'how to.'  Overall, it was a excellent experience.  Delightful atmosphere, knowledgable and friendly staff, great food and cocktails. Highly recommend visiting next time you're downtown!",

It was terrible but the waitress was great and got me a new drink called the Pennslyvania Turnpike which was really good.  We then ordered the \"Carrots\" for an app which were just okay at best.  For $11 I expected so much more.  This app isn't worth $4.  Now I got the Wagyu burger which was excellent.  One of the best burgers I had in a long time.  All the entree's looked great.  I would definitely go back again to try me entree's.",

Am alone so seated in bar area, but server is pretty prompt and friendly.  Coming to food, the roasted root vegetables salad (its warm obviously) is great. Not meat but satisfying. Lamb burger super juicy and fries are out of the world.  Server was great, gave great suggestion to pair wine with lamb.  Overall 5 starts and will surely visit again if I am in Pittsburgh again.",

I was looking for a place to have brunch, was trying to eat at meat and potatos but the wait was 45 minutes so we decided to try this new place that was opened 3 months ago. It is located inside of a hotel..open basement of the hotel lobby..plenty of seats and the decor is beautiful. NO WAIT was needed..awesome!  The best thing I like about this place is its customer service Our server was friendly and professional.   I had mimosa at first which is delicious, typical mimosa good, but didn't have anything special i want to comment on it  We ordered a lamb beni ..it is delicious..poached eggs and chopped pieces of lamb meats on top of an English muffin..poached eggs were done perfectly..meats was flavorful and tender  also ordered the PA burger..mixture of beef and lamb patty...the first time around, ,I felt the patty was burned and tasted really bitter...I brought this concern to our server, and she offered to replace the burger...so the second time around, the manager brought out a perfectly cooked burger, juicy and not burnt at all!  I would recommend this place for friends because of its decor(really unique),, quality of the food and its great service",

    "text": "The Commoner is the beautifully adorned bar and restaurant located just off the lobby of Hotel Monaco. The interior is dimly lit but in the right way with dark wood, beautiful marble and tile work, and a design that lets you know you're where the cool people are.   The bar area is located at the front half of the restaurant and gets pretty hopping during happy hour. Their beer selection is great with about 10 rotating drafts that cover a broad spectrum of tastes. This is accompanied by a selection of about 50 bottles, a nice wine list, and some great sounding cocktails. The bartenders, and overall staff were fantastic. Everyone was quick to help without being intrusive.  For all of the highlights that the space, service and bar offer, the major downfall is the food. My party tried six different dishes including the romaine salad, mussels, charred cauliflower, ribeye, salmon and skirt steak. Across all of those dishes the only one I might recommend to someone is the charred cauliflower. It's a quarter head of cauliflower, cooked to a delicious, nutty brown on 1-2 sides, then topped with a walnut and sage pesto. Unfortunately the dish lacked seasoning and the pesto didn't offer that flavor punch I was looking for.   I ordered the mussels and the Harissa skirt steak. I think that the best part of a mussels dish is the delicious broth in which they are served. This broth had a strange bitterness, and the toast had an off putting, acrid, burnt flavor. For my entree I had the Harissa skirt steak, medium rare. The only flavor the steak had was the same burnt charcoal taste as the bread, and it was cooked to medium well-well. They offered to replace it, but after tasting the unseasoned ribeye and the mediocre salmon I wasn't looking forward to trying anything else.   I'll be back for the bar area, but not for the food.",

You can check out the picture is of the foods that we had for dinner which was; the lamb shank, which falls so delicately off the bone. The chicken which was so tender and juicy. The best burger in Pittsburgh and no doubt you can eat the bun we just choose not to. And not photographed was the tartar appetizer, deviled egg appetizer, and amazing Virginia oysters.",

Steel beams hang heavily in this large space, a dark reminder of the rough-necked workers that built this city from the smelting blast furnaces of then to the glimmering metropolis you are ordering breakfast in today. Exposed bulbs hang precariously above the dining area, threatening to fall into your pork belly hash and ignite the entire section.  Service, rendered by beautiful paragons, is efficient and friendly - we're all on the same group chat now! There is a Bloody Mary bar for the discerning and creative types who wish to mix their own disgusting V8 concoction. I prefer an orange juice with apple cider vinegar.   Every detail of this hotel restaurant is addressed with intentionality and a sense of duty to represent the brand identity but also, and more importantly, the city. If you want to compare blouse ruffles with the West Penn bourgeoisie, go somewhere else. If you want to dine well with the proletariat, run - DON'T WALK - to The Commoner.",

The bartenders seem to take pride in their pours.   But the food isn't what it should be for a place like this. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely not much better than good.  And somethings aren't good, for example I had some oysters on the half shell that I wouldn't recommend.   The brussels sprouts are good, but it seems like everyone has good brussels sprouts these days.   Pork belly mac & cheese was OK but not great.  The luxury pie was a bright spot. And one genuinely great dessert is their sticky toffee pudding.  I will keep returning here, because I love the energy and the atmosphere and because the food is good enough.

    "text": "My friend and I recently had the opportunity to dine at The Commoner for dinner. I was not only excited to dine at the restaurant, but to check out the public spaces of the Monaco Hotel. The restaurant is located one level below the lobby and is tastefully decorated, which I wouldn't have expected anything less.  We arrived a little early for our 6p reservation, but were promptly seated. Their food menu is separated into categories: nibbles (appetizers), slurp (soup/oysters), chomp (salad), graze (larger, vegetable sides), feed (meats), and wood oven (flat breads, etc). On the other side of the menu, you will find a wide array of cocktail choices.  For myself, I ordered the Commoner Old Fashioned. This $12 cocktail is made with smoky pork belly infused bourbon and oaked maple house made BBQ bitters. I enjoyed my drink, but didn't love it. Perhaps personal preference? We didn't get too crazy with our dinner choices, instead opting for their meat board ($16) as an appetizer, and the simple greens ($8) and hearty greens ($11) for our main meals. I'm hopeful that had I opted to order something a bit more, well, interesting, that I would have more to say. You would think, however, that at a restaurant like The Commoner they would churn out an amazing salad, even if it's called the simple greens. Unfortunately, they did not. It's pretty basic, people, and for $8 you're not getting much. Head over to Hello Bistro for a yummier and more fulfilling salad.   Overall, my guest wasn't impressed and noted that he wouldn't go back. As for me, I'd definitely give them another go. The table next to us ordered dessert and it looked scrumptious.   Until next time.",

I had the grilled cheese (with some excellent tomato soup) while my friend had the the duck drumettes, which she sad were very tasty as well. However the service I received was bizarre and off-putting but I would probably return if I were hungry and nearby?  My friend and I went to the hostess to get a table and we felt as if we were intruding on a conversation between her and a server (which continued after we said table for 2). She led us to our table and left and we were then served by a man who seemed to in all honesty hate his job. Thank goodness they leave a water pitcher at the table because I hardly saw him. We got the table next to our's meal (who was there before us) and just handed it over to them since the server placing it  didn't notice. Another server came over shortly after and said \"are we okay? I just saw what happened there\" And handed my friend and I our food. At the end of our meal our server seemed disappointed that we wanted to order dessert. Another thing to add is that I saw an additional table next to us not get served for at least 10 minutes+ as the waiters were talking amongst themselves. So if you can put it with crappy service but good food, head here!",

Both times I have been lead to believe that they are squeezing me in due to last minute reservations. After I arrive, there are tables open throughout the dining room. Ok fine, maybe tables are reserved for larger parties or such. Both times, no one ever sat down at these empty tables. Is this a marketing ploy to create absent hype?   Anyway, the food was very good tonight. I am a sucker for french onion anything. I wasn't that hungry so that's the only thing I ordered with a Coke.

As we arrived when it opened [5 pm - lunch is not open yet] we were seated at a table that did not hold a reservation until 7pm. [it is wise to book ahead until the opening crowd settles] The table comfortably fitted the 6 of us but i must note that I was unhappy for most of the happy hour as there was a consistent draft coming from the staircase which left me shivering.  The waiter was a thrill, personable, with a way with his addressings [I personally do not mind being called dear and darling, however I could see the boys giving him weird looks] and he advised us promptly on the rotating craft beer draft selection and some of his personal favorites. I was happy to have a bottle of the Blithering Idiot, a singular positive about winter: an increase of stout beers on every menu.  With it being 6 pm we naturally sampled some of the food as well. One at our table ordered the Onion Soup Burger which looked delectable and received a positive nod of appreciation and i had two appetizers of the Butternut Squash Champ Potatoes and the Brown Butter Brussel Sprouts. While enjoying the potatoes, I did not find them particularly special and almost forgot there was butternut squash in them, however I found the Brussel sprouts well seasoned and not drenched [:)]  Overall the experience was delightful and well paced. I will gladly return at another time.",

Don't let the jokey names let you think they're to be laughed at though. The cocktails are quality.   As for food, the dinner menu is great. Really most of the menu is a can't miss. The burger is of course a standout, but there are plenty of other options that stand out. Ask the server and from my experience they can all point you in the right direction.",

    "text": "This place had such fun cocktails, both in presentation and mixology. I got the \"What's The Capital of Thailand?\" which tasted a lot like a Thai Iced Tea, but not too sweet. The only issue was that a lot of the flavor / spices was sorta sitting on top and it was a narrow glass with a little too much ice, making it hard to mix it up.   For dinner I ordered the Tikka Masala. The server told me it was vegetarian and said I could add chicken which I opted to do. The portion with the chicken was quite large and I was super full when I was finished but I gobbled it all up, just shy of licking the plate. The dish had spice but the heat was balanced with sweetness of the sweet potatoes. It tasted a bit like a cross of tikka masala and a butternut squash soup. It was a little light on the tomato part.   I really enjoyed the meal but I think the chicken would have been better if it was mixed in to the dish instead of just sitting on top as it was a little bit dry. Also I was a bit shocked to see that adding chicken had an upcharge of a whole 10 dollars. This was not listed on the menu and I've never seen that high of a cost for adding chicken, maybe steak or tuna or something. Shame on me for not asking I guess, but I wasn't expecting that, especially in Pittsburgh. The dish was good, but if I'd known I was ordering a 30 dollar dinner instead of a 20 dollar dinner I would have maybe ordered something else or just opted to not order the chicken as that was the least exciting part of the dish and it was filling on its own.",

A few things that stood out- fresh grapefruit juice, overnight oats, the pastrami smoked salmon, and the English muffins (that were used in the crab cake Benedict and came with the yinz breakfast).   The overnight oats were dreamy. Loved the chia seeds and coconut milk, which made it like a pudding. It was a great brunch dessert- not too sweet and healthy. I do wish there were more nuts, pomegranate seeds, and blueberries on top, however. The smoked salmon dish impressed my dad. The salmon is a great cut and the quality is apparent. The salmon is served with three popovers- a welcomed diversion from a bagel, cream cheese, pickled onions and radishes (?). The crab cake Benedict was yummy, but tasted exactly how you think it would. I do have to say the crab cakes were full of crab meat. The yinz breakfast was delicious but very standard- great if you like a more predictable breakfast. The apple sausage links were delicious, and it came with three large links!  You can definitely pass on the Bloody Mary. We ordered two, because it looked so fun. But I wasn't a huge fan of either the cilantro or regular mix. Additionally, the Bloody Mary bar was disorganized and sloppy at 2pm, and they ran out of bacon! I wish the elements like the pancakes and sausage were kept warm. I'd come back again if I was in Pittsburgh. It's great that you can easily make a reservation for a group of 5 for brunch on OpenTable.",

Reservations are probably needed and parking downtown can be a bit of a pain.   We started with a peach salad to share that was quite good. I then had a strip steak medium. It had a bit too many mushrooms and not enough potatoes, but overall it was good. My dinner companion ordered the chicken fried scallops. They were satisfied, but did note there was too much breading on them. The draft beer I ordered kicked so I had to get a bottle that was poorly poured by the server.  The dessert of cookie with ice cream was great, but a bit expensive at $10.   I would definitely go back, but infrequently as it is a bit pricey.",

But the 2 meals I've had here were underwhelming. The last time we went with a party of 4. Two of us ordered the same fish entree. One was seared (aka basically raw) and the other was cooked through.

The prices for food are a little high, especially for lunch, however the food quality is very good so you get what you pay for.  They have one of the best burgers I have ever had.  It is around $16, but it is worth it.  Cooked perfectly, great choices for toppings and sauce, and a nice brioche bun that holds it up well.  Update: I felt I had to update this review after being back several more times.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.  It has a great feel to it inside and the staff are always friendly and fast.  I have never had anything here that has not been not just good, but great.  My two favorites here have to be the Commoner Burger and the Crabcake Sandwich.  You will not find a better sandwich in Pittsburgh than either of these two.  The flavors are so perfect it is hard to describe.  The burger is also always cooked to order perfectly.  By far my favorite crabcake sandwich and the burger definitely competes for the best in the city.",

    "text": "All the buzz about The Commoner had me very curious... and since I'm always up for a good Sunday brunch, my roommate and I made this our dining destination yesterday!  We were able to get an early reservation at 9:30am, which is more on the breakfast side of the day, but we were glad to get in nonetheless.  When we arrived, the hostess seated us in a cute little corner booth that had plenty of room for us, our big winter coats and scarves.  Plus the booths were super comfy!  Our waiter, Ben, was over right away and offered coffee, juice and water.  A coffee for my roommate and a water for myself, he was back before I could even blink and filled our glasses.  We decided on the Bloody Mary bar to start, and to be honest: you could get away with this as your meal!  They have EVERYTHING on their Bloody Mary bar, most of which is house-made and prepared.  The infused vodkas range from bacon to lemongrass, and there is surely something for everyone.  Sausage, salami, more olives than I even knew existed, pickled veggies, LITTLE GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES (I'm still dying over these)... the list goes on and on.  Ben even gave us 2 plates to add more garnishes to, since it's rather easy to overfill your glass with the goodies.  For our meals, which might not even have been necessary considering the buffet we were partaking in, I ordered the Bacon Beni (house made english muffin, house cured bacon, pork belly, and the most perfect poached egg I've ever seen) and Shannon ordered the Pierogi and Eggs.  I will be honest, I was stuffed to the max by the time our actual food arrived, but the Bacon Beni was superb and I somehow managed to eat almost all of it.  I can't wait to get back here and try their lunch and/or dinner menus, since everything seems so good!   Ben was an absolutely wonderful waiter and was so attentive and kind to us the entire time we were there. I will most definitely ask to be seated with him when I go back!  The restaurant manager even stopped by to see how everything was, and he was pleasant as well.  Food is a huge part of the experience, but the superb service is also a \"make or break\" factor in deciding whether I'll return somewhere... in this case, I will absolutely be back!",

    "text": "5 star service. 4 star dessert. 3 star dinner.  Arriving downtown around 9:30, there weren't many options for dinner in walking distance outside of hotel restaurants. I decided to go with The Commoner at Hotel Monaco. It's got its own entrance on the corner, but you have to walk the whole way through the place to reach the hostess, which is a little awkward. Other than that, I loved the design.  I was seated at a stool across from the kitchen area where I was given a carafe of water and a menu. Based on reviews, I knew I needed the sticky toffee pudding. I asked my waiter if I could order that to eat in and a lamb burger to go. He seemed both surprised and impressed at this request. The clientele were mostly well dressed, so perhaps this is a more play by the rules type of eatery.  My pudding came out fairly quickly and did not disappoint. The best part was the caramelization around the edges--especially the bits that had a crunch to them. I found the $10 price tag reasonable for its size and quality when not even a handful of entrees come in at under $20.  I had to wait a bit for my burger to arrive, but that was fine as the man working the area of the kitchen across from me was great for conversation. I have really learned to appreciate a restaurant that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable/judged for solo dining.  Unfortunately by the time I got settled in to my own hotel, my food was just warm, so I can't be the best judge. The burger was cooked well (medium) and was plenty juicy. My one complaint would be that the greens used had stringy stems. As they weren't the easiest to bite cleanly through, the full leaf often came out with the bite. Fries were good but not memorable.  Overall I would return if I needed to dine downtown late at night.",

    "text": "SETTING:  Black steel beams and warm yellow lighting. I can't think of any other way to describe it than to say it is a combination of hip and extravagant. Word of the day: Hiptravegant.   FOOD:  For appetizer #1, got the Scampi and Chips. Such a basic dish, but I've never had it THIS good before! I might even venture to say that this is better than fried chicken! Uh oh...shots fired. When it comes to fried foods, the type of batter/breading matters A LOT and they did it well--light and crunchy.   Appetizer #2 was the braised pork cheek. So tender and with a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar. I'm 100% convinced Elvis' lyrics, \"Love me tender, love me sweet\" refer to this dish. Not meant to be a tongue-in-pork cheek comment at all.   Then, the entree arrived. The Steak & Ale Pie. Like a pot pie stew, but with braised short rib and a brown gravy broth. Yes, all the crust was eaten. Pretty good, but it wasn't my favorite.  Saving, literally, the best for last is the Sticky Toffee Pudding dessert. Our waiter said this was quite possibly the best dessert he has ever had in his life. Bold statement. But he was spot on with his previous recommendations, so we went for it. Let me put it this way, I wish I could invent something so each bite I took of this dessert would immediately be replenished on the plate! I want to eat this forever.    SERVICE: We were treated well from the get-go. Jeremy, our host, showed us to the table and when he found out this was our first time at the Commoner, he gave us a few recommendations. When we had more questions, he made himself available to us right away. Our waiter was also very patient and informative. Came by to check on us multiple times. Terrific and professional service all around.   IMPRESSIONS:  Such a cool place with fantastic food and solid service. If I'm in the area again, I'd like to come back for the apps and--no question--that Sticky Toffee Pudding.",

Stayed in the Hotel Monaco. We pre-partied at The Commoner, located in a sub-level of the hotel entrance. I like that feel. Similar to an Old World European pub, but of course this place is pretty posh. The bartenders were friendly and well versed in their beverage offerings. Fast forward to the morning after a solid night of celebration and I found myself nearly slumped over in a booth ordering a much needed greasy sustenance on the menu called the Fried Chicken Sandwich. I opted for brussel sprouts out of guilt but should have gotten the fries. Back to the sandwich: This beast was a half foot high and a good portion was the juiciest chicken breast, just the right amount of mayo, potato roll, other condiments and the crunchiest pickles. I was shocked that it tasted so good.   Yes, I was massively hungover, but I'll never forget that Fried Chicken Sandwich.",

They seated us quite a distance from the bar but the place was so loud I couldn't even hear my cell phone ring!  We had a helpful waiter who served us tap water from a bottle and gave us menu suggestions. We ordered drinks, French Onion soup and the PA burger combo for our meals. He told us that most of the menu items are seasoned and that they make their own different ketchups for the burger and the fries. The PA burger is a combination of lamb mixed with ground beef topped with pickles and hot red peppers. It comes with a large box full of French fries.  When we got our soup I asked for crackers but was told they didn't have any. Instead he served us three different types of bread-zucchini, cherry buckwheat, and cornbread. These breads were generous portions with our favorite being the zucchini bread. The soup was outstanding!  We figured we must have come during happy hour since there was a vibrant bar scene. Dress is casual. WiFi requires a pass-code from the Hotel Monaco of which this restaurant is a part of.  After we finished the soup we had to wait at least 30 minutes to get the burgers. The place wasn't crowded so we couldn't figure out why the long wait.  The staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs in the meantime. When we finally got our meals they were cooked just right and surprising light. We loved the homemade ketchup they made for the fries so we added that to our burgers. They were very good.  When we had finished we were given a dessert menu but having consumed the bread since we waited so long we turned it down.  This place is costly, extremely noisy, and long wait times for your orders. Go only if you have time to kill.",

The burger was so delicious. It was topped with onion jam and bacon giving it a Smokey and sweet flavor. The burger also came with a nice helping of fries! My fiance's Tikka Masala was hearty and creamy, and it really warmed him up after our chilly exploration of the city ! If we're ever in the city again we plan on returning !",

I think this would be a pretty good place to check out if you're coming to see a show in Downtown. It is a few blocks away from Penn's row of restaurants, so the more secluded location has its pros/cons. Overall, I liked the quiet and intimate dining space and the appropriate use of black furniture. The food and drinks here are good quality, but slightly overpriced for the area. Still, I could definitely see myself coming back here!",

    "text": "so its late about 10 pm on a Tuesday  we dropped someone at the greyhound  we needed nearby food...usually my trusty yelp app is on par but this evening it steered me a little wrong the search was diner  The Commoner came up 1st and its just down the block ... ok fine lets give it a try  its right on the corner of a really really narrow street  parking oddly was an issue but we finally found a spot this place is dark lots of tables you can see the cooks working in the open kitchen  we are quickly seated look at the single page board menu  whoops this is no diner not even close menu has steak chicken dishes a veggie curry dish salads nothing under 12  ok ...decide we will stay because there is a decent crowd for such a late time  everyone looks happy Our server and I don't know his name was super welcoming  ice tea served right away and water son pretty much only eats burgers or wings and thankfully there is a burger on the menu  it doesn't come cheap at 18 bucks but ok we are here and the place has a nice vibe I decided to try the sticky pudding its $11 it is what it is  my mind set was not fancy steak house prices (they have a waygu on the menu) sons burger is big with a nice side of fries and a bacon extra  bottom bun is so wet he asked for a replacement bottom  and in a flash a new bottom bun arrived interesting right? Also they only have cheddar or provolone for a cheese burger offering the fries are served in their own little metal basket cute and those fries were so nice hot crispy really perfect  my pudding is more like a brown bread soaked in some toffeish sweet sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top it was sweet and tasty are really good 11 dollars good? maybe  the restaurant is in a hotel so if your staying there you can add the meal to your bill  son remarked that this burger was on the list of Pittsburghs best burger I breathed a sigh of relief because if it wasn't I would not have been so happy come with the expectation of an expensive restaurant and you will be fine food is good service friendly",

I really liked the vibe and atmosphere of the place, it is an upscale gastropub and definitely feels special. The only thing was, our table was too close to the bar stools and hence people had to really squeeze in while going back and forth. Anyway, we ordered a bunch of cocktails and also their cheese plate, lamb burger and tikka masalas. The presentation of food was beautiful and we all enjoyed everything, except the lamb burger which tasted gamey and was really nothing special. All in all a nice evening and will probably come back for a special dinner sometime.",

However, as many other places in Pittsburgh the vegetarian options are limited and un-creative.  There is one option in the entre section which was overly sweet Indian Chickpea dish and I ordered the Cauliflower appetizer which to be fair probably good as an appetizer to have a bite or two but as the main dish, very monotonic taste.  it definitely needed some greens or fresh elements to balance the deep fried note of it.  We also ordered Hibiscus ice cream as the dessert which was a total failure and I could not even eat one spoon it as it was overly sweet, tasted like a very sugary bubblegum.  overall, not recommended at least to other fellow vegetarians",

Overall it is a bit pricey, but everything is extremely fresh and well made. The lobster bisque was creamy and great, as was the Scotch egg! For lunch one day I had the short rib sandwich, and then made my way there for brunch the last morning. Wait staff is friendly and quick, and the restaurant has a cute trendy vibe to it.

It is hard to take photos that display how awesome the decor is because the way the awesome lighting design in this place washes out the appearance of the photo. Cool mirrors with maps on the wall awesome interior design. Drinks are really well made and exotic. Stellar drink and food presentation as well. The waitress was nice but if I were this business owner I would hope there was a little more follow up for any additional food or drink orders. She brought out the check and I had been waiting to order another incredible drink. So I awkwardly had to state that we were not done and then she proceeded to bring me the most beautiful decorated drink with beautiful color arrangement of edible flowers. It was a really rich in dimension of flavors kind of drink. Overall a very good experience! Thank you!",

I like the brunch menu best, but I have a weakness for a Bloody Mary with tomatillo juice over tomato, so it is an easy call.   This review is about the bar staff. I was there last night for post-dinner drinks. I love another brunch cocktail- breakfast of champions. I asked about it and they went above and beyond to mix up the ingredients special since it wasn't part of the dinner cocktail menu (it uses this cinnamon cereal milk that is amazing, they had to make it).  I wish I knew the guy's name who waited on us. Tall, blonde, glasses. He was so friendly to everyone, and really made us feel welcome.  Most bartenders would've just said they were out of an ingredient. I watched him approach multiple parties and do just a little something to make each one feel special (light up ice, remembering a frequent guest).  Well done.",

I ordered the quiche of the day, which was a red pepper and onion quiche, and it was savory and delicious. I tried my friend's uncommon toast, which was their take on french toast, and the bread was like nothing I've ever had-super moist and fluffy with fresh berries and cream loaded on top. I also tried the vegetable rice crepe, which was equally delicious. If you're looking for a light, healthy option, this would be a good choice. I've never had a rice crepe before, but it was surprisingly flavorful and delicious. Very similar to a traditional crepe but with a smoother, lighter texture.   Come here for brunch if you're looking for a delicious, yet unique brunch experience. The flavor combinations are out of this world good.",

The service was really slow, and our group of 9 were the only ones there.  It took about 45-50 mins for food to arrive.  I almost ate my napkin.  The burgers we got were not impressive.  They were very bland and lacked any seasoning.  Maybe we got unlucky, but I am not coming back for lunch.  Maybe I'll try the breakfast.",

Seemed like a hipster type joint but the food looked good and gave it a shot. Didn't have my dark rimmed glasses and pomade but let's get it.   This is located in a high end hotel (something with a K). We walked in and \"without a reservation\" at 11:30am were able to get seated at one of the 10 open tables.  A variety of seating options here, 5/6 seat circular tables, high top long shared tables, bar seating, and 1/2 chair 1/2 booth seating. With the decor- subway tile, cloth napkins, and nice touches to bring this from a $7/plate to $11-18/plate. Tongue and cheek stuff aside- water on the table ready to go.   I ordered a coffee which was very hearty- thick cream to go with it. For the meal was in between crab Benedict and pierogi and eggs. Decided to scoop the pierogi and eggs.   This was VERY GOOD. Poached eggs with hollandaise? Sauce. Or maybe it was bernaise? One is richer - bernaise - just butter and cream really. Pierogi were done well- had a little skin on them for a crunch, and the potatoes under were mixed with carrots and were really cooked down well.   Can't say it again but I will- VERY GOOD. Would highly recommend- table was beautiful, smiles all around and a good meal. All I need for a Saturday morning wake up.",

    "text": "While on a trip to Cleveland, a friend and I took a road trip to Pittsburgh. I was charged with finding us a place to have brunch. I came across The Commoner and decided to try it out. Upon arrival, we were surprised to find a tremendous lack of parking and plenty of people waiting in front of the hotel waiting to check out. Luckily, we had a reservation and some time to park in the garage across the street.   We were seating right on time for our reservation and our server was very attentive, polite, and helpful. She came over to the table about 6 times to refill coffee without being asked. My friend and I ended up ordering the same thing - the crab benedict which came with potatoes.   The crab was excellent! It was a good sized portion and was wonderfully prepared. The english muffin was thicker than ones I've had in the past. The texture reminded me of a bagel (a bit chewy) and the flavor was not like any I've had before. It was missing the bit of sour taste in a typical english muffin. It was very filling. The potatoes were cut in appropriate sizes. They were a bit under seasoned and a bit soggy.   The service was excellent and the food was good. With a few tweaks, I would give this restaurant 5 stars.",

We sat down around 4:45pm and saw that we had the \"mid day menu\". This is a really cool idea- however I came for the pot pie which is on the dinner menu. No issues though, more to come on that! The atmosphere was super intimate and modern. They even have \"chef tables\" where you can watch the chefs cook. So awesome!  I ordered a drink that was a spin on a Cosmo. It was delicious! It had a blue liquor in it (I forget what) and was sweet but not overly. It sort of tasted like blue Gatorade. We then ordered 2 appetizers, wings and onion dip. The wings were sort of like an Asian wing. They were grilled and a little too slimy for me. The onion dip had a nice flavor that was not too strong and was served with homemade seasoned potato chips. The chips were my favorite part!  For dinner my husband got a burger which he calls one of the best in Pittsburgh. I got my pot pie! At exactly 5 when the dinner menu became available she said she would put my pot pie in for me. It was worth it! The crust was flakey and moist. The chicken, gravy and carrots were tasty. My only complaint is there were SO MANY peas. Once I ate all the good ingredients out of it a giant pile of peas remained.  Our server was so great! We told her we were sort of in a rush because of the game and she kept checking on us to make sure we were still good on time. She was also friendly and had some good recommendations.  Do not forget to check out the Biergarten upstairs in the summer! Really fun for a happy hour or start to a night out!",

It's definitely a go to spot because it was a full house, so if you have a big group definitely make reservations. I ordered the chicken + waffles with a side of breakfast potatoes and 2 mimosas (very good, great mix of OJ and champagne). The food was yummy but it was just a little on the cold side like it had been sitting out. Our waiter Alexis was great, she seemed a little busy and overwhelmed with other tables but she still tended to our table pretty well. I would definitely recommend brunch here for a girls day, date night, or a solo adventure--they have bar seating. I would like to go back for dinner and try a few of their specialty cocktails.   P.S.  The bathroom has great lighting for pictures lol",

Not cheap, but in line with other restaurants of this sort downtown.   Brunch was somewhat of a disappointment. The fruit plate was a fruit salad, not slices of fruit, and the melons had all been cut so close to the rind that each piece had a hard, flavorless edge. Someone needs to train the prep chef. My husband's egg, bacon and English muffin plate was fine (it's hard to go wrong with that), and the English muffin seemed to be homemade -- at least, it wasn't a Thomas muffin! My \"Overnight Oats,\" however, were a starchy, gloppy, tasteless gluey mess. Oddly, no oatmeal was evident; there was a lot of chia seed so it was like eating frog spawn. I complained and they took it off the bill, but no one said \"We're sorry\" or discussed it with us.   So -- dinner good, breakfast risky. I'd be willing to go again, but I'd avoid the frog spawn.",

I ordered the Vegetables for Brunch dish, which consisted of a rice crepe filled with egg whites topped with herb salad, roasted red peppers, and sauteed broccoli. The broccoli was cooked perfectly; still crunchy for texture with blackened bits that added a balanced bitterness that I really enjoyed. The egg whites were surprisingly flavorful, very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I also liked the crepe even though it didn't have too much flavor on its own.  I also ordered the Bloody Mary bar with Pepper Vodka. The mix itself was pretty good, a bit vinegary but still yummy. However, I was disappointed with the \"bar\" part though because the mix-ins were lacking. There were about 20 different hot sauces but no celery salt, no pickle juice (a favorite of mine), no cayenne, etc. While there were toppings like pickles, olives, and bacon, the mini grilled cheeses available as a garnish were cold and old--probably not the best choice for something that would sit out for the duration of the brunch rush.   As a Baroness of Bloody Marys, I'd give the Commoner Bloody Mary Bar a B- but the food gets an A!",

Oh by the way, we were lucky as my disdain was within ear distance of the host staff.    Why make folks wait for empty tables?  Why not improve your lack luster service and bring folks their food hot.  No one should have to ask for food to be served hot.    I have visited this place a number of times and this was my last.    Create exclusivity via good service and food and you will no longer need to force good customers to wait for empty tables.    Not impressed and will never return and sadly the Monaco is my favorite hotel and yes I will be back to stay at The Monaco however I will never again patronize the Commoner.    Instead I will continue to go to Vallozzi's where no one makes you wait for an empty table and the food is impressive.",

For lunch I ordered the striped sea bass which was perfectly cooked and for dinner I had the catch of the day, steelhead trout.   Drinks are also great here. Got a couple of old fashioneds for dinner at the bar and they were made perfectly. With big ice cubes so that it doesn't get watered down too fast, how it should be.

The answer is yes, and there was no reason why this amazing restaurant should have failed in comparison, but, alas...  1. The ambience is glorious. You are instantly transported to another time when you sit in this open and eccentric venue.   2. The menu is tantalizing to view. The cheese plate alone got us all geared up for a brunch to remember. The cheeses were all mild, though pleasing, and there was a magnificent array of honeycomb, chutney, and nuts and berries to compliment them.   Unfortunately, the main dishes did not follow through. The chorizo dish was swimming in oil, the eggs were underdone (if this was on purpose, I get it, but they were cold) in the pierogi dish, and the potatoes were also overly oiled. This is something to expect in a greasy spoon, not a restaurant with $15-30 entrees for brunch.   3. The service. Why was the name of our server listed as \"Darth Vader\" on the receipt? It was almost appropriate, as she didn't smile the whole time.   I had heard wonderful things about The Commoner for dinner, and I might return, but I would not recommend it to another for brunch. If you're up for a delectable brunch in Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes and Eleven are still my top recommendations.",

We took a seat at the bar, though, because we like chatting with bartenders and getting recommendations.   First, the bloody mary bar is legit. So. Many. Options.  I wanted to add all of it to my glass! I used a house infused spicy vodka, and whatever else I threw it made one yummy drink.  The man had the Norwegian dish, which he said was just ok. (The bagel was toasted too much and made the dish tough to eat.) I ordered an english muffin with pork belly, bacon, and egg. (I don't see it online, so maybe it was a special or on their printed menus only.) Anyway, all I can say is I won with my food choice. No complaints other than I was full and couldn't order seconds!",

Holy deliciousness!!! I am going to say it is the best flavored drink I have ever tasted. Yes, it was that damn good!! I had a San Pellegrino. I enjoyed an entree of Tikki Masa, it was served with very fresh pita, do they bake the pita in house? It was that fresh.... Flavorful dish, a bit sweet, as is this kind of dish, but I loved it. Leszek had the Buffalo Cottage Pie, it was served in a skillet and was topped with Whipped potatoes and filled with a savory gravy, ground buffalo and veggies. I ordered a glass of Commoner Cabernet, bottled just for them from California. I had to save it for after dinner as my Tiki Masa was to spicy to enjoy a glass of red. This wine rocked. We will return.",

It's a gin cocktail served over a watermelon chili ice cube!  Yum.  So refreshing!  Also, they make their own tonic.  They had a few flavors to choose from.   For dinner I ordered the hangar steak with fries. It came with house made Ketchup and steak sauce.  My steak was ordered medium, because that's what the chef recommends.  I like my steaks prepared medium rare but I always go with what the chef recommends.  It came out well done and dry.  It had a nice flavor and I really enjoyed the the fries and ketchup!  I don't even like ketchup but there was something magical about theirs.    I highly suggest you make a reservation.  It was a packed house. We couldn't get in until 9:45 for our reservation made a week prior.  They had a rooftop bar that we didn't get to enjoy, it was at capacity.  Bummer.    Great place for cocktails and apps!  Hopefully next time I'm in town I get to check out the rooftop bar.",

Perfectly cooked medium which I requested, the bun was fluffy, the whipped goat feta was creamy, the pickled veggies were not too tart and the sauce was heaven.  I upgraded to the Brussels and bacon and it was everything you expect - huge pieces of bacon, slightly oily and crunchy Brussels.  I also had the rosemary lemonade which was very refreshing.    However, I finished with the coffee, which was very good, and the pumpkincrack dessert.  Hysterical name, very dry cake and very salty ice cream.  The concept of putting salt on ice cream appeals to me, but have a light hand.  This was dumped on.  The cake was also so dry as to make it almost inedible had it not been for the dollops of pumpkin pie mixture on top.    I would very much say go for the food, don't stick around for the dessert.",

The low rating of only 3* reflects the devious, unacceptable wine offerings - basically, just a handful of choices at astronomical prices. For example, a Hess Chardonnay, a decent $10 to $12 bottle, is $14 per glass. That's pretty high, but not outrageous until you discover it's a 5 ounce glass, not the standard 6 ounce pour you get everywhere else. At that price a 6 ounce glass would be almost $17, a bottle $70. Ouch! The 5 ounce trick is revealed by their pricing of bottles at 5 times the glass price, while everyone else sells bottles for 4 times the glass. So, if you like the food, bring your own wine and pay the $15 corkage fee like we did.",

I planned a little further in advance and we got in. Wow! From beginning to end, from decor to staff to food, this place has it all! We got to The Commoner right at our scheduled reservation time. We were greeted promptly by a friendly hostess and were seated immediately. At first me and the hubby were taken aback by how close the tables are but once the food comes out everything and everyone else fades away. The decor is chic, cool, & neat. We loved the aged, faded, wood floors and the steel columns & beams with awesome low lighting that seems to spotlight your food. We were greeted by our friendly waiter who was attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered an app to start: the meat board. It was good but I am not sure we would get it again when we go back. It contained prosciutto, pates, duck confit, and, what can best be described as a mouse-like meat blend (yes, I know that does not sound great) but paired with the grilled bread, out of this world! For my entree I got the brick chicken which was served on a bed of garlic roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts covered with a burnt leek puree. We have never, in our lives, had chicken so tender & moist. It was a huge chicken and to have it cooked perfectly-awesome! We loved it. The hubby got the steak frites. He picked the rib eye, again, the meat was cooked perfectly. Although he noted when we go back he is going to get the chicken. His fries were delicious too, well seasoned and a little crispy, terrific! For our dessert our waiter recommended the sticky toffee pudding and me & the hubby both got our own (no way I am sharing if it is that good). Oh my goodness! Heaven! We would stop back just for this. Phenomenal! The steamed date cake was just amazing! And it was topped with toffee sauce and rye vanilla ice cream. I could eat this stuff for days and not get tired of it. Even my drink was good. I got a plum tarragon shrubble, light and sweet! All in all yummy and scrumptious and we will visit again and again even if it's only for the sticky toffee pudding (did I mention that I loved the pudding?!).",

The food is not for everyone and would not be my first recommendation for an out-of-towner.  Many of the cocktails featured in the menu include herbs.  The one I tried was vodka based and sent it back.  The other was a twist on a cosmopolitan which I also sent back and then asked for water (it's server warm so ask for ice).  Main course I had the scallops (Smoked scallop mousse, poached lobster, escargot heirloom beans, crispy kale, preserved lemon, watercress oil)  the scallops were good but the beans were an odd accompaniment which did nothing for the dish. For dessert:  Sacher (Chocolate pound cake, ground cherry jam, ganache).  It's was mediocre like eating an overpriced brownie but bonus you get 2 so it is sharable.  This was not the best first time dinner experience.  I was honest with the waitress when ask how I enjoyed my meal.  I was impressed that the hostess/manager was informed and she came over and gave me a gift card for free drink/dessert to give them another try.  I may have just chosen the wrong menu items so I will give them another chance sometime.",

He came over to us immediately and asked if we had been there which no one had but me so he went over the menu. He explained each dish starting with the appetizers in great detail.  So much so, that we ordered two appetizers:  the veggies and the short rib mac.  Both were awesome, I really liked the roasted vegetables and so did the rest of the table.   When he came back to let us order our dinner meals he again explained everything in detail and let us know what he thought was really good and what was usually a fan favorite, which I appreciated.  The menu is a little different so it was nice to get an explanation of what things actually were.  Two of my colleagues got the short rib, two got the 10oz steak, and I got the half chicken.  From all of the comments everything was delicious.  I really enjoyed my chicken and it was so tender that i didn't even need a knife to cut it - so good!!!!   We were very full but Chris has suggested we at least look at the dessert menu which of course we obliged.  He explained everything again and we ordered dessert.  We got the smores dessert, the nutella mousse, and the ice cream that was on special (it was some sort of black seed type ice cream).  They were all so good, AGAIN!  Chris gave us excellent recommendations.   I would highly recommend giving the Commoner a try for both brunch and dinner!  My experience for brunch was quite the same, we just had a bigger party so I truthfully didn't pay much attention to the service.  But either way - TRY IT!",

The location, inside the Hotel Monaco, and the chef, coming from an afar land (Washington, DC that is) to make his mark in the Burgh. Both, very exciting reasons to visit.  The place screams hip. They seem to think of every detail when coming up with a concept, down to the mis-matched serveware. I was super pumped with the freshly baked bread basket offering, as that can set the tone of any great evening. I was really into the pickle bread, which had real pieces of pickle in it!  I ordered the Cedar Plan Scottish Salmon for my entree. It came with butternut squash champ potatoes and celery salad. I had no idea what the potatoes would be like, but love butternut squash, so I was in! I think I would have gone for a tad more butternut squash, as I really didn't taste them with the powerful potency of the potatoes. The salmon was good, and well cooked too. But, I think I was expecting a more impressive dish in terms of flavors.  We ordered the bread pudding and cookie tray for dessert. I had in mind it would be grandma's cookies for the tray, when it was really an upscale mix of cookies. The bread pudding was very good though. You can't go wrong with warm bread and ice cream.  I feel like with all the hype, I was expecting to be blown away. While everything was good, I'm excited to see where they take the restaurant as the months progress. I've definitely got eyes on the bar scene very soon!",

I suspect out of towners will be more wowed than devoted foodies ...  The physical space is most excellent. It sits in the Monaco Hotel (which is one of my favorite hotels in Pittsburgh) and lives up to the hotel's funky, and vibe. It's, again, a hotel bar ... so prices are a bit high. You should expect to pay $15 for a gourmet burger here. It's also a bit loud.  The staff are as cordial and helpful as you'd expect. Great talent working here.  The Bloody Mary bar hooked the brunch crowd I roll with. Drinks are top shelf ... great bar here.  Stop in if you're nearby, you'll be pleased you did.",

I won't lie, it was tasty despite basically being a plate of sauce with 5 chickpeas and 7 chunks of sweet potato. Worth $20 though? Nah. They also charge a cake cutting fee of $4/person. That is completely fine, but our server failed to let us know that after asking if we were celebrating something. Sooooo this place is probably better for a non-vegetarian without a sensitive stomach that likes to splurge on nothing.",

I ordered their daily seafood special, and LOVED it!  They are baby friendly & have a great kid's menu.  My baby went to town on his mac-n-cheese (and I helped!).  While the food is somewhat expensive, the servings are plentiful and tasty, so no value is lost.  The drinks could be stronger for the price but the food is so amazing that I did not deduct any stars for that.  Grab a baby or a friend and hit up the Commoner!",

The restaurant feels chic.   The service was very professional and prompt. The drinks were very good. I got the Old Fashioned and my wife got the Moscow mule. Both were very well crafted. As for the food, we had the wild mushroom cigar for an appetizer, which I highly recommend. I had the burger for the main course. I ordered medium rare plus and the meat was cooked perfectly to my preference. The burger came with fries which had great seasoning. My wife ordered the Pork Chop. I tried a couple of bites and thought the meat was rich and flavorful. However, keep in mind it is a heavy dish.   The portions are generous, the flavors are rich, we left with full stomachs. Will definitely come back to try some of their other dishes.",

It's a beautiful place. You'd expect a place like this to serve really good food. The waiter attended to me instantly with water and coffee but then things started to skip a bit.  For $4, you get an extremely basic house coffee that's nothing to write home about. Unfortunately, even for $4, the coffee wasn't refilled at all until after my food arrived. I struggled to flag down my server and when I finally did, he asked me to hold on a bit. I would have been a bit more patient had I not already been waiting for a refill. I was a bit surprised he didn't ask one of his peers to help, it doesn't seem like they help each other refill customers' cups.  I had the Yinz Want Breakfast which consists of egg, fried potato, sausage, and English muffin. The muffins were still mostly hot raw dough, potatoes were really bland, and the eggs were just all right. What WAS out of this world though was the Applewood Smoked Sausage. I especially loved the flavor but nothing about this meal made it worth the $16 I paid for it. Everything was pretty much iHop quality with fancy tableware to make it stand out.  Kind of skeptical of lunch at this place as well.. probably worth checking out once but I likely won't be back to find out. Or maybe try another dish? The salmon looked good too.",

    "text": "This is a difficult restaurant to review, and I rarely have difficulty deciding on a \"star\" level to give. However, lots of considerations came into play and resulted in the middle-of-the-road rating.  I came here for my friend's birthday brunch where she had a reservation for 7 people. I automatically expect larger tables to be slower, and that is fine. However, there was no table available at the time of our reservation, and we were quite early.   The space itself is breathtakingly gorgeous, but a beautiful space doesn't automatically equal a good experience. The noise was so overwhelming that it was hard to have a conversation with someone right beside me. So while I was impressed with the aesthetic of the place, the noise level was too overwhelming.   Choosing a suitable option as a vegetarian with additional dietary needs on top of that was also very difficult. If you're a vegetarian who can eat everything vegetarian friendly, you'll be fine here! I have carbohydrate restrictions however, so my only option was a quiche, and I had to hope it would be vegetarian friendly since it is made Sunday morning, and no one knows in advanced what it is.   My partner and I lucked out, because the quiche was root vegetable and goat cheese. Not only was it colorful and plated with excellent presentation, it's probably the best quiche/breakfast food I've had in a long time. I gave my side salad to my partner though because I don't touch cucumber, and he raved about having a quality side salad with a meal.   My friends ordered a variety of things from the menu, and everything was presented quite well, and we all seemed pleased with our food.  Unfortunately, our server was slow. This is about the server's service, not the kitchen side. When some of us really need to leave for other plans that day, it took her nearly 20 minutes to come back with our receipts and debit cards. Notably, she served the older and noticeably wealthier couple beside us quickly (yeah, I'm calling it out when someone shows obvious preferential treatment to someone decked out in furs and came in long after we were there).   As for the kitchen, I understand that busy places take time to cook. It took over an hour to receive our food. This isn't too much of a complaint, but note that receiving your food might be slow, and if you have other plans, it might be good to note that with your server.   Lastly, I'll probably only come here again for the most expensive cocktail I've ever had, The Death at the Disco was freaking phenomenal, and also maybe to take shameless photos of myself in the balcony area of the hotel itself because yeah, it's gorgeous.",

We did complain, but rather than asking the offending members to be considerate, they offered to move us, as we were finishing our main course. REALLY?

It was busy, and they were holding tables for a large group, but the pleasant hostess had a 2-top cleaned for us and sat us quickly. We ordered the Western PA omelette and the Irish soda bread French toast (which an employee at reception recommended). Took about 15 minutes for food to arrive. The omelette was good, so was the side of bacon. Learned that French toast should never be made with Irish soda bread -- way too dense and dry in the center to be enjoyable. Overall, 3 stars -- better than most hotel restaurants, but nothing special. Seemed very accommodating to families with small children.",

Then our server came over and walked us thru the new drink menu.  Ordered the gold cup and the toasted coconut old fashioned and both were fantastic.  Then he brought us a sausage wrapped deviled egg.  Would never have picked this off the menu, but it was fantastic.  Their house hot sauce is to die for!  For entrees we had the PA burger and the lamb shank with a side of the hearty salad.  Both entrees were fantastic and the salad was delicious - hearty greens, but not a hearty portion.  The entrees would have been plenty with the app, so it just depends on how hungry you are or if you want leftovers.  It's nice to be able to go out and order entrees and have them be filling enough on their own.  Then we were so full, but had heard about the date cake dessert so we had to order it.  It blew us away!  We thought we'd take a couple bites because literally the thought of eating anything else seemed impossible, but we found ourselves finishing every last crumb!  The waiter really made the night though.  I wish I caught his name, but he was absolutely fantastic.  Will be back and will order a lighter meal next time so we can enjoy that dessert even more!  My only \"complaint\" was that the women's room needed attention and when I told the hostess, she immediately took care of it.  Great new place downtown.",

    "text": "I have been a huge fan of Kimpton hotels for many years so I anxiously awaited the arrival of Hotel Monaco.  We decided to go with our best friends to the Commoner for a birthday celebration on a Saturday evening in February.  Sadly, our experience was not just disappointing -- it was horrible.  Things started badly when we (along with several other parties who also had reservations) waited nearly 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence in the reception area.  No host or hostess, no manager, no one who seemed remotely interested.  When we were finally seated, a male and female server engaged in a somewhat heated argument over and across our table concerning who would serve us.  She won and we lost.  She took our drink order and disappeared for nearly 30 minutes.  We could see our drinks sitting on the bar and debated whether we should walk over and get them ourselves.  We should have; apparently it would have been appropriate.  We watched people from two other tables do just that after they grew tired of waiting for their drinks.  My husband and our friend each ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell and my friend and I split the cheese flight.  While still waiting for our drinks, the oysters -- at least some of them -- were delivered.  Both plates of oysters had two empty shells.  The remaining oysters were dry and shriveled, most likely from embarrassment. When we pointed this out to the servers who delivered them (our server was still MIA and the drinks were still diluting on the bar), both servers shrugged and said they didn't know what had happened, and then went MIA with our waitress.  The cheese flight was dry and minuscule - it must have been sitting on a ledge somewhere for hours like our drinks.  The person who served the cheese flight was unable to provide any guidance on the identity of the cheeses.  Once in a while we would catch a glimpse of our server running around looking perplexed, but she failed to make an appearance at our table for quite some time. Perhaps she was distracted by the noise; the acoustics in the restaurant are horrible.  We could hear all the loud conversations going on at the bar -- 30 feet away from us -- but could not engage in dinner conversation with our dinner companions across the table without shouting. And still no manager to be seen anywhere in the restaurant.  Finally, our server arrived with our drinks and took our dinner orders.  We told her about the missing oysters which seemed to throw her into another tizzy.  Our friend ordered a steak which arrived overcooked and gristly -- and once again a lengthy wait for someone to bring a steak knife.  My husband ordered the seafood chowder which consisted of five overcooked  shellfish/seafood items served on a barren dish with a small pitcher of congealed and tasteless white sauce.  I ordered the unimaginative and unseasoned salmon which was served cold and dry. My friend had the wheat seitan which, although nothing to write home about, was probably the best choice of the evening.  All of these were delivered by our otherwise MIA server who took another drink order that was never delivered.  Perhaps she hid in shame after serving what purported to be our dinner entrees. After waiting for another half hour after we stopped eating our entrees (note that I did not say finished eating), she finally came back to the table to ask if we were ready to order dessert.  We weren't -- we had all we could take. For the first time that evening, she actually was fairly prompt in bringing the check which still included the charges for the less than complete oyster appetizers.  Rather than quibble and spending another hour waiting, we paid the bill and got out of there as soon as we could. What a debacle! And I have spoken to others who have had similar experiences. Such a shame.  We had such high hopes. This is not what we have come to expect from Kimpton.",

    "text": "We had reservations for 18 people for 3 months.  When we get there, the set up they were trying to do was awful.  After about 25 minutes we just split up and didn't sit together for a Christmas gathering. We started with the Pretzel w/beer cheese and bacon wrapped dates which were both fabulous, the meat tray and the cheese tray not so much, just OK.  The Braised short Rib was outstanding, the scallops and pork chop also very very good.  Two guests had the Steak, which was a not get again plate.  Edible, but just ok.  The desserts were not very pretty or tasty.  Not one of us finished them.  The service was slow, had our server came over they would have sold at least 36 drinks (2 a piece) more over the 3 hours.  They would benefit the servers also telling first timers to order a salad.  Most of us just took recommendation off server and did not realize salads were not included.  That's our fault for not paying attention, but up selling is better than not.  Will definitely go back again for the short rib and pork chop.  I try not to review first visits, but I will edit after 2nd try. I did enjoy the atmosphere and decor even if it was very loud!",

The restaurant was nicely decorated and open. There was a cool vibe   to it that made the place comfortable for business and pleasure or just a great place to stop after work. The service was very good and the staff attentive.  The menu contained an ample assortment of vegetables whether fresh in salads or roasted. The charred cauliflower was to die for.  Our entrees were good but not outstanding.  My wife had salmon on a cedar plank.  She was quite happy with her choice.  I picked the short rib pot pie which I found to be only average. Then as contents of the pie had a decent amount of juicy short ribs and root vegetables. The crust however was the dishes downfall.  Instead of light flakey crust, it was a thick bland piece of pastry. That small complaint will not deter us from returning.  The menu has many interesting things we want to try on our next visit",

The \"Bacon Beni\" was cold and the English muffin was super sour. Good luck choking down the super-chewy pork belly.   The \"Mess Beni\" was truly a mess. This dish consists of a large bowl of chorizo, both ground up and in sausage form, along with a couple splinters of red pepper and one small red potato cut in half. The ingredients are baked together so that you end up with a piping hot bowl of chorizo grease. Then 2 poached eggs are laid on top of the mess. If the cooks would simply substitute 2/3 of the chorizo for red potatoes, this dish may be a winner.   Service from the waitstaff was excellent...friendly and attentive. Since our waiter failed to ask the obligatory, post-meal question, \"how was your meal?\", I suspect that he is aware of the the aforementioned shortcomings. I'm still looking forward to sampling the dinner menu!",

Negroni's are acquired tastes, they're quite bitter and if you're not into that whole mouth feel/scene you better skip out.  The meat plate was great! I'd probably not get it a second time, since I'm a bit more partial to cheese. Birthday boy wanted the meat plate so that's what we got.  I ordered the scallops with polenta -- they were great! Perfectly cooked, melted like butter in my mouth.  The boyfriend got the rib eye, it was huge! It was delicious! It was inducing jealousy from everyone at the table!  Our other two people with us got the lamb burger and scallops. Everyone oohed and ahhed about their food.  It was a table of happy people. Our waitress was lovely and sweet. (Especially when we had a slight issue about out dinner bill and my credit card).  We were quite pleased with dinner!   Now on to breakfast: The hostess was quite rude when we wandered down after check out. She said she could seat us at the bar or a long table. I said \"oh lovely! either would be great.\" and she snapped back \"WELL MAKE A DECISION, HEH, WHICH ONE IS IT?!\" and then rolled her eye at us. I said table and we were on our way. I got a bloody mary, I was really feeling the previous nights debauchery in my head and stomach and was trying bravely to face it.  My boyfriend got some fresh juice concoction that looked horrific but he said it was really delicious.  Our waited was fabulous and sweet.  We ordered the bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon and a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with home fries. Both were great! Thoroughly enjoyed and eaten with very hungover mouths. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't craving something greasier to ease my alcohol wounded stomach.  Those home fries though... my god they were the best I've ever had. I dream about them now.  I would definitely go again, maybe this time I'd be a little more decisive so as to not anger the host staff. The atmosphere is really great though, the lighting is perfectly low enough, the music is not intrusive.",

This was by far one of the most amazing meals that we've had the opportunity to experience together.  We started off with the 'Scottish Deviled Egg' which turned out to be the best one we've ever had (sorry mom)!  My husband chose the 'French Onion Soup' as his next course and I decided to try the daily soup which turned out to be 'Cream of Carrot'.  I fell in love with this soup after the first spoonful and devoured every last bite.  I selected the 'Crab Shells and Cheese' as my entree while my husband chose the 'Steak and Ale Pie'.  Our server suggested the 'Charred Cauliflower' to share and we're so happy she did because the presentation alone was phenomenal!  Our entrees were equally delicious and I ended up taking home half of mine because it was so filling.  We ended our dinner with 'The Crumble', a perfect combination of apples, butternut squash and lemon ricotta.   We also enjoyed a few specialty cocktails throughout our two hour experience with my favorite being something with gin and blackberry.  Clearly I had a one cocktail too many because I can't remember the name!   We're already planning our next trip back and I hope you start planning yours after this review!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Wednesday night with my wife for her birthday dinner.  The first thing that you notice when entering the hotel is a beautiful garden themed chandelier.  Once you get past that and start heading toward The Commoner then the noise really starts to pick up and by the time you are downstairs inside the Commoner, as many others have noted, it is quite loud.  I would guess that's because it is a huge open space without much to deaden the noise.  That's not to say that the decor isn't quite cool though as it is.  It has an old school industrial type feel with unstained oak floors, exposed duct work and cool but exposed lighting.  As for the layout there is a bar on one side alongside an open kitchen and a ton of seating in the middle and the other side.  The open kitchen also has bar like seats facing into it that I would love to sit at some time.    My wife and I were actually using an opentable gift certificate here and we correctly guessed that there wouldn't be any change from it.  So we went big and for appetizers we ordered the turkey poutine, blue crab fritters and giant Bavarian pretzel.  They all came out at the same time and our small 2 top didn't really have the space for it. Even so we made it fit.  Out of the three items I think that the turkey poutine was my favorite.  It was a wonderful play on Thanksgiving dinner as the fries were sweet potato fries, it came with fresh cranberries and then it also had the turkey and gravy on it.  While the fries were a bit soggy by the time that I got to them I thought the flavor of the dish was nice.  The blue crab fritters also tasted pretty good and I thought that the breading gave them a hushpuppy like taste.  It was the pepper jelly on the side that I really enjoyed though as it gave the fritters a nice sweet heat.  Last but not least was the giant Bavarian pretzel which was quite large.  It tasted like a good pretzel would and had large granules of salt on it and came with a beer cheese.  While the beer cheese was good, the small cup (a few ounces at best) of it was very disproportionate to the size of the pretzel and we quickly ran out of it leaving us to finish most of the pretzel without any.  After finishing the appetizers I was getting pretty full but I still had a beef short rib entree coming out next as well as a side of Brussel sprouts and bacon.  My entree came with sides of mashed potatoes and sweet and sour cabbage.  The short rib here was super tender and when combined with the potatoes reminded me of a pot roast, only with much better flavor.  Even though I was struggling to finish my meal because I was so full, the Brussel sprouts with bacon were calling my name because the bacon in it was sliced thicker than most bacon that I have seen.  After all of that we still had some money to spend so even though we weren't hungry in the least, we ended up ordering the sticky toffee pudding.  It came out nice and warm and tasted good enough that even without being hungry we both devoured it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant as well as the food with my only complaint being the general noise of the place.",

    "text": "I came here with two friends for my birthday dinner. The restaurant, itself, is stunning. The tavern theme really runs through this place. We were seated right away and had a beautiful table near where the food comes out. Our server seemed enthusiastic and attentive. He took our order for drinks and appetizers then came back later to take our orders for dinner. Appetizers were nice. We shared the Blue Crab Fritters and Duck Rilettes. However, our server literally disappeared for the rest of the evening. Another server brought us our entrees. I had the short rib and my friends had the pork chop and the ribeye. We all thought our dishes were average - nothing amazing that stood out. To our surprise, the ribeye was completely raw in the middle. However, no one came to check on us at any point during our meal. Our water ran out quickly, so we literally had to ration our drinks. It was already difficult to flag someone down, but we thought at least our server would come to check on us after our meal. A little over an hour into our dining experience, our server finally came back to ask us what we wanted for dessert. We had the toffee pudding, which was excellent except for being a bit dry, and the butterscotch pot de creme. The pot de creme was so bitter from the kumquat that it was hardly palatable for anyone in my party. After our dessert, our server appeared again to give us our checks. Sadly, we were all fairly disappointed that the most service he gave us was charging our credit cards quickly. Overall, I really thought The Commoner would be an amazing spot, but the service really killed it for us. The food was almost there, in terms of quality, but did miss the mark on some important aspects. If you're thinking about dining here, I'd say it's a gamble with The Commoner. The reviews are fairly impressive, but your actual experience may be a total disappointment.",

    "text": "I had such high hopes for the Commoner. In short, the food was incredible. The decor is stunning. But the service and acoustics killed it for us.   The 4 of us dined on a Saturday night and had made a 9:30 reservation several weeks beforehand. When we walked in, it was complete madness, like a club. I understand a show had just let out at Consol so I'm sure that had something to do with it. But it was total chaos. We finally made our way downstairs to the host station and were told that our table was not quite ready. No big deal, we were seated within 5 minutes. It was just very difficult to find a place to wait without being run over by other guests or servers (one in our party said he was pushed aside by 3 servers during our wait - and we were standing right against the wall).  We were seated in the center row of the restaurant, which is absolutely gorgeous. We were quickly provided with water and drink menus. However by this time we were nearly shouting at each other across our small table, it was so loud. There was also some sort of Prohibition party going on - literally right in the middle of the restaurant. So people in flapper costumes were milling around (waitstaff included), right up against our table. They set up a buffet table right behind us to pour shots and hand out wristbands (apparently there was a cover charge). And there was a jazz band. Again, right in the restaurant. IT. WAS. SO. LOUD.  Our waitress was not friendly in the least. She seemed incredibly annoyed (maybe because of the party and lack of ability to move freely throughout the restaurant?). At one point, we were enjoying the bacon-wrapped dates (which were to-die-for), and I didn't realize my menu was underneath my plate. She grabbed the menu and said \"I'm going to take this.\" She was just so terse and unwelcoming. It seems other reviewers have had similar experiences. Aloof and uninterested are accurate descriptors.  We waited quite awhile for her to come back throughout our meal, and at one point a manager came by to check on us. We asked him if he could help us out with drinks. He obliged, but only two of us got to order before he jetted away. Also, my husband ordered a Winter Lager and definitely received something different. It was good and he drank it, but just another miss. When the waitress came back she never offered me another wine. She didn't offer me a drink until we were about finished with our meal (and my glass complete empty). At that point I just wanted to go home. She also did not offer a box for my leftovers (which I had plenty of - the portion was very sizable). Just not the service I expect when coming to a restaurant like this.  As far as the food, two of us got the short ribs. Incredible. I am not even a huge sauerkraut fan, but it was sweet and jammy. One of us got the pork chop, which was super tender but overloaded with salt. I like salt and salt almost everything I eat, but it was overbearing. One of us got the scallops and said they were very good. And as mentioned earlier, the devils on horseback (bacon-wrapped dates) were delectable.  I would MAYBE consider coming back on a weeknight if I were downtown and looking for a place to eat, but there are way too many other restaurants on my list. I would not go out of my way to come back.  Food=5 Acoustics=1 Service=2 Visual Aesthetic=5",

Their steak tartare, cauliflower and scotch egg are a few memorable items from our visits.  In terms of drinks, there bar program is top notch.

I made reservations 3 days in advance and could only get a 9:30 pm reservation, which was fine because I figured we could get drinks at the bar beforehand.  First the valet station was empty when we arrived, we waited to be attended to for several minutes and eventually gave up and parked at the nearby garage. The bar space was small and crowded with limited seating. The overall crowd at the bar was really rude and we were really turned off by the inconsiderate clientele.  Once we were seated the service and food was good. The menu had unique offerings but was pretty sparse, I had hoped for a little more choice. Since the hotel layout was very open the Dj and guests from a wedding in the ballroom could be heard, making the restaurant very loud.  Considering you have to go through the trouble of parking, advanced reservations, and less than enjoyable visitors, I would not go through the trouble to come here again.",

I was traveling alone, so I was seated at the chef's table facing the kitchen (which I loved).  I was directly in front of the woodburning oven and prep area.  It was amazing to watch the various dishes being prepared....the signature charred cauliflower, bone marrow, steak & ale pie.  I wasn't starving, so I ordered the shrimp & chips appetizer, and side of brussel sprouts. The food arrived a short time later.   There were 3 HUGE battered shrimp and a nice stack of waffle cut chips that were sprinkled with malt vinegar dust....yum!  Tartar sauce accompanied the shrimp, I would have preferred cocktail sauce, but they were still yummy.  The sprouts....oh, those sprouts....were so tasty....pan roasted, sprinkled with parmesan and then topped with lemon zest, YES!   I perused the dessert menu, still trying to decide if I wanted dessert.  My server gently suggested the signature sticky toffee pudding.  I'm not a big fan of dates, so didn't think that I really would like the date flavored cake, but ordered anyway.  Am I glad that I did!   The dessert arrived in a small tureen, warm and yummy, drizzled with toffee sauce and topped with Rye whiskey ice cream.....OMG, it was so tasty.   I would definitely return to the Commoner!",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the Hotel Monaco properties. I stay at their hotels and eat at their restaurants often when traveling.. so I was excited to try lunch at the Commoner. I walked past the host stand and who I believe was the host fiddling with his cell phone. I was alone, so headed to the bar. The female bartender struck me as pretty rude and off putting straight away. I asked if I could eat at the bar to which she replied only \"sit anywhere, but not there\" referring to the seat directly in front of me that had a jacket over the chair and a drink on the bar. Like I would actually sit there. At first I thought she was joking around but there was not a bit of humor or sarcasm in her tone. I grabbed a seat at the bar and asked for a lunch menu. I was given a cocktail menu and before I could even look at it asked if I wanted a drink from it. To which I replied \"I'll probably order a drink once I know what I\"m getting to eat\" I moved the drink menu aside and asked again for the lunch menu. Offended it seemed that I had no interest in the cocktail menu, she practically threw the lunch menu at me. At this point my phone rang so I stepped away to the lobby area to answer it. I had left my seat for less than 2 min to take a quick call and returned to find my seat taken and my silverware, menu and water removed.  Rude bartender said \"I thought you left\". To which I replied\" I think it's rude to talk on a cell phone at the bar\". The bar was pretty empty as it was now 3pm so I took another seat. I ordered half a dozen oysters, brisket sandwich and gin, tonic splash of Campari. My cocktail was very poorly made, not enough gin, too much Campari, a lime when I asked for a lemon and no cocktail napkin. My food arrived quickly and all at the same time. The oysters were a disaster. First they were shucked terribly, still attached to the shell, missing their liquor and with lots of broken shell particles remaining. Accompanying them were the classic mignonette, some lemon and all over the actual oysters was an obscene amount of chopped parsley, pickled vegetables, pickling liquid, mustard seeds, black pepper, chili pepper, and a mess of other spices from the pickling liquid. Such an overload of unnecessary crap on them you could not taste anything resembling an oyster. The brisket sandwich was basically pot roast on a onion roll.. tasty but nothing special. Rude bartender put on a fake smile with a last ditch effort to be nice as she dropped the check never asking how everything was. Overall very disappointing.  The Commoner was exactly that... common.  So staying back at the Hotel Monaco.. Against my better judgment brunch at the Commoner. 11:05 am Walked up to the host stand alone and stood directly in front of 3 \"hosts\" talking among themselves. Really unbelievable.. Standing there basically looking directly at them for a full minute with no greeting or acknowledgement what so ever until I speak up and say \"excuse me.. Can I see a menu\" girl with red hair glasses big hoop earrings asks \"Do you have a reservation\" to which I reply \"no but it's only me and I'm a guest in the hotel\"  host: \"sorry we are all full\" me: \"but the dining room is totally empty.. You don't have room for 1?\" \"No sorry it's all booked 'til 2pm,  I start to walk away.. unbelievably shocked at how this \"host\" would be so dismissive to a guest when I look over to see several empty seats at the bar. So i walk to the bar ask the bartender \"is this seat taken\"  \"why no.. have a seat\" \"can I get brunch here?\" \"Of course\"   Wow really?? Good food.. Nice bartender (tall redhead). (Fyi.. 12:10 dining room still half empty) This place has the potential to be very good. They need to clean house of a few rotten employees with ZERO customer skills, who honestly don't give a shit about real customer/ guest experience and will never get IT.",

    "text": "My husband and I were staying at the Monaco and rather than fight Pittsburgh's horrible traffic (sorry Pittsburgh,) we decided to try The Commoner. The first night I ordered the scallops and my husband had the burger. The scallops were accompanied by beet risotto and a wilted green, beautifully composed and delicious. There was a choice of fries or a salad with the burger, but unfortunately the server did not reiterate that choice and fries were served. They didn't go to waste, but we would have liked to have been reminded of the choice. Portions were generous, so we did not have dessert.  After a tiring day at UPMC, we decided to return to The Commoner. This time we decided to simplify our choices, so we ordered the Bavarian pretzel to share ( and still brought some back to the room.) Each of us ordered a salad. I had the roasted root vegetable salad and my husband the watercress salad. Both were wonderful and we felt we had made the right choice. We both like beer and after having had a Pittsburgh Pilsner during the wine hour upstairs, we wanted to have one with our meal.  Unfortunately that beer was not offered at the Commoner bar. Mistake!  The servers on both occasions were friendly and efficient without  being overbearing.  The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and welcoming.  It is a natural pairing for those staying at the Monaco to be part of The Commoner experience.",

    "text": "Meh. Lacked depth in flavor. Sometimes it seemed simply lazy. The following is what I tried and my review:  1. Ceased salad: 2 stars....and only because the dressing was homemade. The eggs tasted as if they were old, like they were cooked in masses and then refrigerated. The romaine was dry on the edges, which clearly indicates that it wasn't fresh.   2. Broccoli cheese soup: 2 stars....only because the roll that accompanied it was fairly good. It was very liquid like instead of creamy, like the base was stock instead of milk or cream. It had almost no flavor and the broccoli pieces were all cooked to bits and tiny. You couldn't get a biteable piece of broccoli.  3. Flatbread: 3 stars. It was fine. Just ok. It was like every other flatbread you'd get at any restaurant of a similar level. The middle pieces of the flatbread were soggy, which was disappointing and kind of gross.   4. Smoked deviled eggs: 1 star. Very very fishy, the salmon roe was enormous, and there was only one piece of dill on one egg. Kudos though to putting some of the filling beneath the egg before playing so as to prevent them from rolling around.   5. Beef Tatar: 4 stars. This was the only thing I ate here that I would confidently say was good....not great mind you....but good. A little overpowering with the horseradish at times, maybe like it wasn't mixed thoroughly...idk...  Anyway, I expected much more from this establishment than what was given. Please note! The bar was very clean and the bar staff impeccable. They explained all of the drinks they were making for customers and happily answered all of my questions. I only drank beer so I don't know as to the quality of their concoctions, however they appeared to be meticulously made and thought out.",

The couple next to us made anniversary reservations and they had a little congratulatory sign on the table for them.  For drinks, I had a \"Quarter Life Crisis\" whisky drink. It was delicious! It also came with a little hunky man hanging off the side of the drink. The tables are real close together, so my drink was the talk of both tables next to us. Our waitress was awesome and ended up giving the other 2 tables hunky little men too.   As far as the food, my husband and I both got the specials. I had the fish and he had the steak special. The food came really quick...actually too quick. Both of our meals were cold, so I think they may have just had them ready already? I don't know, but we grudgingly sent them back (it's not something we would normally do). The staff was real nice and apologetic. We felt bad, but it really felt like something that had been sitting out for a half hour. The manager brought our meals to us the second time around and it was much better! My husband said his steak was excellent. My fish was a little overcooked, but overall, everything tasted really good.  For dessert, we shared the sticky toffee pudding. Omg, so good!! It was a date cake with toffee sauce and quality vanilla ice cream on top.",

However, the food itself was really good.   I had been here before for dinner and enjoyed the entrees much more. The food came out hot and tasted like it was just made.

Honestly, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed eating it with the salmon. It wouldn't taste the same without it. The texture of the combination and the creme on top was just amazing.    * Price vs Worth: If you wanted to splurge more on brunch, I would probably suggest coming to this place. The Salmon Blini was $14 and I saw other dishes were around $18. The portion looked small but honestly I was very full even after sharing it.   Will I come here again? - I'd only come here if a friend wanted to try it. The food was good and the place looked beautiful but I would rather spend the money to try a new brunch place!",

Each time we've been here it's been for brunch/breakfast or drinks, but never for lunch/dinner although I'd suspect that would be good too.  You can make reservations through the hotel if you're staying there, via phone, but I prefer to book trough yelp (super easy).  Their cocktails are really elevated and they have a great bar (with a fair amount of space/seating).  No tv, so this isn't the place to catch your favorite game, but I like that.  You can see into the kitchen from most seats in the restaurant, which is cool.  Service has always been nice, but sometimes a bit delayed/at a slow pace, and I've had circumstances where they've gotten orders incorrect a few times, and that's probably the only reason I wouldn't give this a 5.  That and they've run out of things a few times (whether a dish or type of liquor for their Bloody Mary bar).  Speaking of, if you can make it here for brunch, I'd highly recommend it.  Try the Bloody Mary bar-it's like a meal in itself (you can put anything from capers c every and bacon on your drink to sausages and mini pancakes-it's pretty awesome).  Definitely worth a trip downtown for, and a no-brained if you're staying in the hotel!",

Their cocktail menu is awesome and they also have a decent amount of beers on draft. The cocktails are rather pricy but they definitely seem to have a lot of work that goes into them. Someone I was with tonight had the \"Alright, Alright, Alright\" and it had a small picture of Matthew McConaughey clothes-pinned to it. We had the fondue to start which came with apples, Brussels sprouts and potatoes. I wasn't crazy about the latter. I had the Commoner Burger tonight and it was okay. I think they could use a better bun, the burger kind of just fell apart. Overall, worth checking out.",

I'm not a huge tomato soup fan on the regular, but this hits the spot on a dreary Pittsburgh winter day.  The one thing that constantly annoys me about The Commoner is the need for a reservation. Typically I'm pretty good about making a reservation, but sometimes it's more of a last minute decision. I've never been able to get seated without a wait (even trying for an early lunch) without a reservation. It probably wouldn't annoy me as much if there wasn't always open tables. There's always open tables. Anytime anyone mentions going to The Commoner for lunch, there's always a collective eye roll about the over-inflated need for a reservation.",

I'm thinking I didn't want them spitting in my food at this point ya know??? Bf ate most of his salad. She ended up taking off my oatmeal which I told her not to... cause I WAS gonna eat it.

I ordered Vegetables for Brunch-crepe, broccoli, roasted red pepper, kale, egg whites, romesco sauce with an herb salad and a Bloody Mary from the Mary Bar.  Mike ordered Pierogi and Eggs-potato and cheese, caramelized onion, kielbasa, and mustard sauce. The second visit I just had a Bloody Mary, which, if you're creative like me, can become a meal in itself.  The restaurant is located adjacent to the Kimpton Hotel Monaco.

The wait was really long but not their fault, just make a reservation...save yourself the hassle.   The service was extremely slow, even after we had been seated, it took at 10 minutes or so for someone to come check on us/offer water etc. Coffee refills also took a long while. The food took a long time to come, I was told that it was because it was ordered medium well which takes time...but ive ordered burgera before and this took almost 3 times as long as im used to. I can say that it was almost worth the long wait because we really enjoyed our food. My husband loved his steak and eggs (your choice of how eggs prepared), my commoner burger was delicious, I especially loved the onion jam and I if I could, I'd smear that on everything. My mother in law loved her salmon dish. I would recommend this place but perhaps not if you're absolutely starving.   Oooh, and try the sips/shots. The citrus one really packed a much needed punch to my mildly hungover body.",

I still continue to go back regardless of the price, because everything is always so good. Just a note- no happy hour specials here (sad face).  I have tried the vegetarian curry dish (maybe it is a tikka masala) and it was good, but not my favorite thing I've tried there. I also like to order the daily special. I have had the special about 4 times and it is ALWAYS amazing. The monkfish that they had recently was to die for. I suggest the special 100%.  Other than that, Commoner is definitely the hip place to be, nice ambiance, a little noisy, but a good atmosphere overall.",

Only downside was How we entered and felt odd about how we were sat at a table. It seemed that we would've needed reservatIons for brunch by the way the host Greeted us. Also, wasn't too happy to be so close to another couple when there were more tables available. If it was crowded, I'd undeRstand but it wasn't.   I was oveRwhelmed with what drink choice to select although to go back in time, I would've pickEd a Bloody Mary. I was also having a tough time selecting brunch. I would've picked at leasT 5 different things. I ended up picking the crab/eggs BenedicT w/ homefries.   It was so good.  I enjoyed every bite.   I would love to go back. Ill get the pierogis.",

    "text": "This review might not be as fair, because I am factoring in the Elf pop up bar with my experience at the Commoner. First off, that pop up bar was STUPID. it was in a hotel conference room NOT The Commoner. The line was wrapped around the hotel to get in, and once you did get in it was a total bust. The \"Elf\" decor was limited to the movie Elf playing on a 32 inch TV in the back of the room. There was a few balloons and cut out paper snow flakes hanging from the ceiling, but that was about it. There was a huge hype for this pop up bar that led to a huge disappointment.  Anyways, after my friend wasted an hour of our lives at the pop up bar that we will never get back, we decided to take our drinks to The Commoner and get some dinner. We got there right before 7, and the hostess said it would only be a 10 min wait. It was more like 5 which was great. The space at The Commoner is beautiful. The ambiance def gets 5 stars. We were seated at the \"chef's table\" which was bar like seating overlooking the kitchen. We loved it! It was cool to watch the staff prepare the food and utilize the wood fired oven.  The menu is pretty limited, but that's not always a bad thing.... my friend and I decided to get the scotch egg appetizer. We were both super impressed! The egg was wrapped in lamb sausage and sitting in a yellow curry sauce. It was a lot of different flavors combined, but it totally worked.  My friend ordered the fresh catch which was branzino over fennel. I had a taste and thought it was very tasty.  So.... I ordered the lamb burger that was served with taziki sauce and crumbled feta. The waitress asked if I wanted to add bacon and egg. I said NO, but guess what came out on my lamb burger?? The bacon AND egg! I reminded her that I didn't order it that way, simply because I didn't want to pay for the up-charge. She apologized and offered to take it back and make it right, but I said nah it's no big deal. It really wasn't that big of a deal, but I did not like the bacon or egg on the lamb. On a beef burger, absolutely. But it really didn't pair well with the lamb. It was my fault for not removing it, but it shouldn't have been there in the first place :(  I would also like to add the service wasn't that great. It took a while to get drinks and place an order... not to mention our server wasn't very friendly.  Bottom line.... won't be going back to The Commoner.",

We were sat quickly and server did approach us quickly for the greeting and for water but that's where the great service ended.  We had to wait quite a bit to get our drink orders in and when we asked about separate checks from the beginning for a party of 5, the server hesitated and then returned and said, \"Just so you know it might get busy later so it might be a while for me to get the separate checks together.\"    As for dinner, the appetizers and dinner were excellent and the food runners were very courteous and helpful and seemed to help us more than our server did.  We also had to wait quite a bit for checks to arrive afterwards and when we asked him if he had a second to please take a photo for us, he said \"I'm a little busy at the moment.\"  And the restaurant wasn't even that busy or even close to capacity.  And lastly one of our coworkers paid with cash and when the change arrived, he had rounded up to the next dollar without even asking.    I don't think I'll be returning to The Commoner next time I'm in town even though the food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  It was the service that was lack luster and didn't seem adequate for the style of restaurant and price.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for 5:45 on a Tuesday night. It was packed but we got seated right away. Like other reviewers have said, it's quite noisy inside. Also, a lot of the tables are uncomfortably close to one another-- we could hear the conversations of the couples on either side of us. Not the best place if you're looking for a romantic/intimate date spot. Thankfully, my husband and I were just looking for good food, so it didn't bug us too much.   I ordered a champagne cocktail to start and it was quite tasty. My husband's old fashioned was made well.   For appetizers we got Devils on Horseback and a Scotch Egg. The Devils on Horseback were delicious, but let's be honest, how can dates stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon NOT be awesome? I do prefer my bacon a little crispier than what was offered, but that's just a personal preference. The scotch egg was good. This was my first scotch egg experience so I have nothing to compare it to, but I'd order it again.  I ordered the Commoner Burger and my husband got the crispy chicken thighs. My burger was cooked to perfection and topped with a sunny side up egg that was also cooked perfectly: just a little bit of yolk. You better believe this burger came with bacon too. Crispy bacon. Be still my heart. The fries that accompanied the burger were ok, but definitely paled in comparison. My husband's crispy chicken thighs were not crispy at all but the meat was fall off the bone tender. The chicken and the Concord grape gastrique were a delightful pairing. I love a good sweet meat!   Unfortunately we didn't have time to try dessert as we had a show to attend at 7:30. Our server was very nice but service is a bit on the slower side:  I'd suggest giving yourself two hours if you expect to get though 3 courses plus drinks here. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.   We'll be back for dessert soon!",

You won't forget it. It's definitely slow cooked to perfection. It tastes so fresh, that you would think that there was a farm downtown on Grant St.  I mean, it's like the cow was butchered right in the restaurant. And the sauce that is used. Praise Jesus.

We were celebrating M's birthday, so we chose a place we thought would be excellent.   When our server first came to us and asked for drinks, he was professional and friendly and we had a lot of faith in him as our server. Little did we know that he would be pretty much absent for the rest of our meal. No one came to ask us how our entrees were. I think our server may have just forgotten about us, as we saw him walk past us more than three times. Yes, we could have tried to flag him down, but we were curious about how long it would take him to realize we were there. It was a long time; we were without water for 45 minutes.  The food. Crispy blue crab fritters: Good. Duck rillettes: Okay. Pork chop: Bad; most of it was just too dry/tough, and I wish I could have tasted more of the maple butter. Short rib: M did not like it. Ribeye: C could barely eat half of it and thought my dry pork chop was good compared to his. Sticky toffee pudding: We had to try this because we read so many good things about it and it was indeed very good, but we would have preferred more of the rye vanilla ice cream for the amount of cake there was. We finished the ice cream before the cake, and so the rest of it just wasn't the same without the ice cream. Butterscotch pot de creme: We did not taste the butterscotch and we were not a fan of the bitterness of the kumquat compote.  Things that were worth getting: crispy blue crab fritters, sticky toffee pudding, and the brown butter pecan shortbread that came with the butterscotch pot de creme. That's 2.5 things out of 7.  The interior of The Commoner is beautiful (lovely lights and mirrored walls), but much of the food we ordered was a mistake. We paid over $65 per person for this disappointment. Not worth it.

It's like an echo? I seriously bypass this place if I have important things to discuss with guests.  Decor:**** On point with the industrial look and feel. I love the Hotel Monaco upstairs with pops of color and play on the traditional Victorian...  Waitstaff:* There is confusion as you walk in the door. If you come in from the hotel side you have someone to greet you and it works out nice. If you enter from Strawberry Way there are 2 doors. One that goes into the bar and another that everyone looks at you like ummmmmm, you arent supposed to be here. The waitress did not connect with us at all. She was awkward and confused. It took her forever to come to our table after pouring water. This is the second time I've had this experience. Also, when my beautiful cheese plate was delivered the lady couldn't remember the cheeses and said \"shit\".   I need thus place to learn a little lesson from the staff at Mallorca.  Food:**** Food is amazing...every...single time",

I like Brussel sprouts so this was a hit for me. They can make this vegetarian if you prefer it that way. For entree I had the commoner burger and my friend had the Tikka Masala. My burger was yummy. Tender and cooked to perfection.   My friend didn't like her Tikka masala. It was sweet and generally tikka masala isn't sweet. So if you're looking for a spicy Indian curry, this is not your place.   We finished the night with tres Leche cake but that was disappointing. Very spongy..which is the opposite of what True tres leche should be.",

Maybe that's a good thing for some, but for me it was a bit over-the-top. I finally settled for a burger which came over-cooked and tasted quite dry. The presentation was good but that's about it.   I gave it one more try the next day for breakfast but again was disappointed by the offerings on the menu.  I settled for a yogurt parfait. The homemade granola was very good but very sparsely distributed throughout the parfait which only included a few blueberries on top and was 90% yogurt.

The bread served with it was tasty, warm and perfectly toasted, and the mustard was pretty good. Sadly the star of the dish fell flat.  The steak and ale pie was pretty, but the short ribs were stringy and dare I say a little dry and there was not much more to it than a watery gravy. I think there may have been an issue in the kitchen as two tables next to me sent dishes back (one cold, one overdone)  The best dish of the evening was the crab pasta, which had a fair amount of crab, though lacked any texture.  Beer selection is great, though all the taps were down. There were still many nice bottles to choose from. Cocktails were also done well, though the odd pacing of the dinner limited our imbibing.",

I started with a mimosa that was good, but wow was it overpriced. Maybe I just expect more for $10, like some fresh fruit garnish or maybe house made flavored OJ? The bar tender was heavy handed with the champagne pour, however...so it must be some swank bubbly.  My friend decided to imbibe at the Bloody Mary bar. This was $16 (a little pricier because she went top shelf). Her tip is to load up on the garnishes first and THEN add the juice. Wink. Thank her later.  I chose the \"yinz want some breakfast\" off the brunch menu with sausage , potatoes and house made English muffins. Eggs were standard, potatoes were standard, sausages were delicious, English muffins would have been perfect if they weren't so naked. No butter, no jam, no jelly...what gives? I would have asked for some if the bartender hadn't made me feel like such a newb for inquiring about ketchup.  Maybe this is more of a dinner and drinks place, or maybe just drinks. I'd be willing to try again at a different time of day to see.",

I paid $18 for a half dozen oysters, and while they were big, and delicious, $18 is a little steep in my opinion.  One of my favorite things is the house made tonics which are paired with either vodka or gin. They typically have a choice of two or three, and I chose the blueberry lavender and was not disappointed.  They are light, crisp, and create a great warm-weather drink.  And then there is the always amazing sticky-toffee pudding.  The waitress (who was lovely) shared my love of this dessert, and told us that it is the only menu item that has remained since the beginning!  And I clearly am very in support that it NEVER leaves.  It continues to be a very loud space, and can make you feel like your yelling (because you likely are) just to talk to the person across the table...but the food is great and despite the steep prices...I keep going back!  Next visit will be for brunch..stay tuned!",

The drinks never wow me. I have tried a pantheon of whiskey concoctions that have all been boring and uninspired. They were never bad but never great! I went the other day for food though and was very impressed!!! I get steak tartare anytime I see it on a menu. We shared the tartare (I ate the whole thing) along with a meat plate. It wasn't our wisest decision to order a meat buffet but that's what we were feeling at the time! The tartare instantly was ranked second best in my mind, only behind Butcher and the Rye. For our entrees we shared fish and chips and a shrimp salad. The salad was so good  and had a smokey dressing but kind of was forgotten because of the perfect cooked fish that came with the other dish! I think I just need to continually eat when I go to the Commoner and stick to the wine!",

Once we got off the elevator and walked toward the restaurant the noise was earsplitting. We were sat in the rear of the restaurant, thankfully the noise was muted in the rear. We were provided seats at the Chef's Table and it was amusing and entertaining. The atmosphere and decor was splendid. We had a wonderful waiter (Jeff) that attained to us and gave us many menu suggestions. We started with the Cheese Board and it was an okay start. Some of the bread and crackers were a bit stale. Succeeding the cheese was the Farm fresh Heirloom Tomato Salad with Buttermilk Ranch, it was very tasty and fresh. We then order the Seafood Stew and a basket of assorted \"fresh\" breads. The Stew was exceptional but the bread was far from fresh. We called Jeff over and explained to him that the day old bread was not worth the $5 up charge. He agreed and removed it from our check.  Overall it was a fun place with a few, relatively small issues. We would return next time back in Pittsburgh, and maybe a four or five star review may materialize.",

    "text": "Nancy Reagan famously said When it comes to drugs \"Just say no.\"    I have my own version of this, which is just as addictive, mind altering and pleasurable.  When it comes to the commoner's Toffee bread pudding \"Just say yes.\"    Get the toffee bread pudding. Do it, or I will never forgive you.  More importantly, you will never forgive yourself.  Now that we have that out of the way, brunch is a good place to start at The Commoner.   There is a bloody mary bar that has all of the accouterments, and is 2nd only to the endless bloody mary toppings of Meat & Potatoes.   Overly obsequious waiters tend to be a problem in swanky hotels. The ambiance hits the mark between hip rustic industrial and dimly lit speakeasy.   You walk down stairs to patent leather upholstered booths, high ceilings, and thick wooden tables, feeling like you've found the only place that will serve gin in the city.   The menu has a small plates section that is priced well and just as tasty. The service is top notch, attentive but not pushy.  The onion soup burger was decent, but very well done.  the brussel sprouts were good, but not great.  Other than the toffee bread pudding dessert the flavors aren't transcendent, and the dishes are tasty but not particularly imaginative.    If you go, definitely checkout the main  hotel and the roof top deck, they're both beautiful, and provide a much bigger pull than the restaurant itself.  Worth going to for the decor and view, but with so many amazing high end brunch spots in Pittsburgh, you can find even more flavor per dollar.",

I get that escolar is served elsewhere and I have no doubt that your fish is fresh; but it is potentially dangerous and patrons should be provided with a warning so that they understand the consequences.  As I stated in my review, multiple food sites mention the dangers of consuming this dish, which tells me that either:  a) you don't concern yourselves with the well-being of your patrons or b) you don't understand the risks associated with serving this fish.  Either answer is unacceptable for an established restaurant such as yours.  You also did not address the condescension of your GM, which was beyond rude.  I expected your reply to not address the root of the issue and I stand by my original review.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the downtown Pittsburgh area that we will frequent in the future.   We will not visit the Commoner again based on your choice to defend your actions rather than correct them.",

Ordered a regular Mimosa and husband ordered a beer. Beer was cold and fresh, Mimosa leaved a LOT to be desired (champagne and/or OJ could have been colder but didn't really taste great). Husband ordered a fish sandwich and wasn't much impressed. I ordered the Yinz' Need Breakfast with fresh fruit, eggs were perfectly done but the English muffin tasted horrible and while the fresh fruit was fresh, it had been sitting out for a while. Pretty expensive for the quality of food. It is a large restaurant which is nice and looks like it would be nice for families but the price would not be cost effective. Would I return? Maybe as I have been told the Shepherds Pie is really good BUT if that were not available, I would not eat here again.",

It was obvious to me that the new Manager addressed all issues as the food was great and the service too. I returned the next night for oxtail soup and kale salad which didn't disappoint. My intention was to pay my bill and leave but I peeked at the dessert menu and had to try the sticky toffee pudding. Loved it!",

Service was awful - slow, server was not friendly & was unable to be found most of the time, we watched our food sitting under the heat lamps for almost 10 minutes. When it did arrive it was ok but nothing great. They gave me an overload of undercooked bacon as well as two pieces of toast the size of my pinky. My friends were satisfied with their meals but for the high price of an omelette/eggs & toast to us it was not worth it. Overall we were not impressed & would not recommend The Commoner.",

    "text": "Dined there last evening as a party of six trying to celebrate a birthday.  Noise level is off the scale.  We were at a round table, which is usually nicer than a long table for conversing with a larger group. In this case, the noise level pretty much restricted conversations to whoever was sitting to your right or left.  Even then you had to talk very loud to be heard.  So if you're going, and hoping to catch up with friends on what's going on in their lives, consider yourself warned.  My food was very tasty.  I had their Seafood Chowder every bite of which was delicious.  Happily the waitress warned me that it was \"deconstructed\" rather than a bowl of soup, but they provided a little pitcher of the chowder cream which was just right for pouring on and/or dipping the various ingredients in.  The portion size was just right for me, which means a tad small, but plenty.  My wife had their Brick Chicken which was also quite tasty, but in contrast to my meal, her portion size was huge. My meal left room for dessert which was their delicious Whitepot, a form of bread pudding.   We shared it and it was very good.  And finally, the valet parking.  It was very busy when we arrived and the sidewalk out front was jammed with cabs forcing us to wait 5 to 10 minutes until we could pull to the curb and turn the car over to the valet.  The valet charge is $9.  We observed that they parked our car on the street right across from where we got out.  When I left I gave the valet our claim check and pointed to my car.  He said I should go get it because he doesn't drive a \"stick\".  I paid him and gave him a tip, which I later though was dumb on my part, given the lack of service.  Four of us walked across the street, got in and left.  I guess he also is challenged when it comes to opening doors.  If there is a next time, I'll park elsewhere. Funny, on the way in my friend asked if valet parking is a problem these days seeing as how my car has a stick.   I told him it has never been a problem, and that apparently being a valet requires knowing how to drive a standard transmission.  So...there's a first for everything.",

The one issue with the space is there are horrible acoustics, so dinner conversation was pretty difficult.  For appetizers, we had blue crab crispy fritters and the giant Bavarian pretzel, both of which were delicious. For my entree, I had the crispy chicken thighs with cauliflower puree and brussels sprouts and I loved every bite. My foodie grandparents raved about our meal and their stamp approval is hard to come by.  For dessert, we had the dark chocolate souffle cake, which is served with peanut butter sauce, salted caramel ice cream, and garnished with roasted peanuts.  The cake itself is more of a standard flourless cake, but damn was that dessert good! I live in Los Angeles, but will definitely insist on coming back here next time I'm in town.",

I also had the Bloody Mary, which is nice and spicy.  My wife ordered the Skirt Steak and Frites.

The frites come with a charred tomato ketchup, which is also unique and flavorful.  The atmosphere at the Commoner is really comfortable, and the service was impeccable.

My BF forgot his phone in the car, and I \"thought\" I left something in it as well...4 hours later. They were so busy parking new comers and retrieving cars for existing patrons, and never once made us feel bad for sending them on another venture to the lot...because of our thoughtlessness. I seriously can't say enough good things about this place. I would stay a night or two more if we could. Definitely will be back.",

The first time I had the PA burger and fries, which were great, and most recently I had the 'Mess' dish which was what the name implies, all sorts of breakfast meats/items/ egg in a nice hot miniature skillet. The service here really shines too.",

The decor is beautiful, the atmosphere wonderful, we had excellent service and the food was amazing. We had the cheese board and mussels for appetizers and both were delicious. Our entrees consisted of the pork chop and pumpkin gnocchi, and we ordered a side of brussel sprouts with bacon. The food was amazing! The first time I visited I had seitan that was made in-house and it was unbelievably good. Our server was very warm, friendly and attentive. Our food was served with perfect timing. The cocktails were excellent, as well. This is a must try place!",

Given the type of restaurant and the prominence of the shepherd's pie on the menu, I'd expect it to be a signature dish.  In fact, it was little more than piped mashed potatoes on top of a pool of gravy.  As soon as my fork (it actually comes with a soup spoon) touched the potatoes, they wobbled back and forth on the pool of liquid.  The gravy had tiny crumbles of ground lamb and only two small \"chunks\" in the entire bowl.  I swear there were no more than about 15 peas and 3 small pieces of carrot.  Otherwise, it was all gravy.  And for this, I paid $16.  The flavor was fine; no better or worse than you'd expect of shepherd's pie.  No complaints about service, and the atmosphere is nice.  But that's the best you can do with the food, I'll have to pass.",

    "text": "I first went to The Commoner on Valentine's Day this year.  It was an awesome experience...very cool pub-esque atmosphere, innovative food, and a really stellar craft cocktail menu.  We went out with a group of friends for a wedding celebration a few weeks ago.  Once again, the experience was fantastic.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best restaurants in the 'burgh.  The waitress was so friendly and attentive.  The drinks and food rotate seasonally (always a good sign).  We tried a few (maybe more, I lost count) cocktails, and they were all very good.  This restaurant is NOT cheap, so if that's your goal, be forewarned.  We had a Smoking Monk cocktail that was $20 bucks a pop, but it was the smoothest whiskey drink I've ever had.  The food was also very good.  I will say, again, portions are small by American chain restaurant standards (you decidedly will NOT need a doggy bag), and the greens with my chicken were getting a little cold.  That being said, I've been here before and I know that that isn't the norm.  I think part of that was the size of our party and how busy the restaurant was.  That's the only reason I took off one star.  They were also kind enough to give us a dessert to split in honor of the wedding.  Granted, they made several hundred dollars off of our table, so the $9 dessert wasn't going to kill them, but it was nonetheless an unnecessary gesture that shows they were willing to go above and beyond to help us celebrate.    I hate to specifically comment on the food here because the menu changes often and so referencing specific dishes might not be of much help.  If you're a foodie, you'll find something that appeals to your self-proclaimed sophisticated palate.  If you're not a foodie, and you prefer the \"50 Shades of Beige\" approach to eating (just kidding, to each their own), just ask a server and from my experience, they'll be more than happy to guide you in the right direction.  We had two people in our party that won't even put ketchup on their fries (yes, somehow they're from Pittsburgh), and they found something they could eat there.  I'm pretty harsh when it comes to my restaurant expectations, but The Commoner has yet to let me down.",

I came here for a good meal and some peace while I reviewed some cases for work. I ordered an Western Pa omelette with no tomatoes   and waited. As my waitress returns I notice the tomatoes, so I send it back. I watched as she returned to the tall black chef to tell him the mishap. He proceeds to yell and slam pans around, throwing a temper tantrum as if it were her fault. She came back with a fresh omelette and it was thoroughly brown and over-cooked, I didn't even attempt to eat it. I left her a nice tip and was on my way. Can't say I'll be returning here. All I was looking for was some quiet and some tasty food, and instead was subjected to unprofessionalism and wasted my money. The one star is for the speedy service.",

I similarly enjoy the Commoner in terms of the setup & design.  However, I was there for an early lunch and noted that both the service was slower than hoped and the room was louder than hoped.  This could have been due to my table's position in the center of the room, but it was hard to keep conversation going. I ordered the Lamb Hash, and felt like A-Ok is about how to describe it.  Not bad, but not anything to rave about.  I look forward to going back and giving it another try.",

Our third even offered that perhaps he could just stand by our table, partly in jest. Finally, I asked if we could just sit at the large communal table and she basically shrugged a yes. Wow, so helpful and friendly. We ordered the deviled eggs, a salad, mushroom soup, succotash and crab mac and cheese.  All except for the soup was tasty if a bit pricey. The soup was awful- completely flavorless and I mean completely. During our meal a woman breezed by to inquire about the food but never even gave me a second look when I said,\"Actually, this soup is terrible.\"  My cocktail was good but they were out of a few microbrews the guys wanted. The whole vibe came off as \"We are just soooo cool.\"  The Biergarten was closed because it was too cold- about 65 degrees. Huh?",

    "text": "It's difficult to not jump immediately to that sticky toffee pudding.  +1 and I had made reservations here before a weeknight hockey game.  Luckily, I am a nebshit and had to go through the new Hotel Monaco.  After seeing what the little boutique Sephora lookin' spot's deal was (I still couldn't tell you), I found that is how you have to go.  We watched more than a couple parties come in through Strawberry Way--you know, what's listed as the address--and be overlooked.  Um. A member of the management watched an older couple walk in, be confused, and leave without saying a word to them.  This woman also sat us at the very waaay end counter looking into a prep area (weird), but that's a whole 'nother tiff.  We did luck out sitting in the bad kids section though, as it was much more quiet and our server was INCREDIBLE. Super helpful and patient, even though she definitely did not have time for my indecisiveness.   On her recommendation, I had a buck and a brace first which ended up being extra sweetened cider and vodka as they were out of the bison grass vodka that it should have been made with.  Cider definitely was not the Arsenal bone dry either. Kind of lame.  But! I tried again with the pandan rickey.  A slightly boozy grass seltzer with a tiny bitty hint of gingerish lime?! Yes. Why isn't everything ~infused~ with pandan?  I guess obsessing over my new favorite plant got me in the mood for more, as I ordered the green plate special.  This dish was my savior; everything else seemed to be pig, burger, or brussel sprouts.   You get these little seitan disks with three veggie sides. So much food! Veggie sides include mashies (\"champ potatoes\"), yaknow, and half an order of that charred cauliflower you all love so much.  The dish wasn't too flavorful, but I don't believe it was necessarily supposed to be, and I am into that. We didn't get bread though. Just sayin'. Since he is predictable, +1 had the onion burger.  The bun is apparently dipped in the onion soup and given aioli spread.  He ate the damn thing completely, and even commented on how good the actual burger was (as sometimes there's a skimp on the meat when there is all kinds of other fancy stuff going on it). His fries that came with that burger were all me though. It sounds crude, but they were like Long John Silver's fries .. which is awesome. Get over yourself. I ate 'em all. And, of course, we had the toffee pudding as dessert.  I know everyone raves about it anyway, but we need to highlight that rye vanilla ice cream-- slightly less creamy than normal with a beany hint.  I don't even know what that means and who cares. Makes a woman want everything a la mode forever.  I have too much to say for The Commoner. I thought this would be more involved, more British, more .. not for Pittsburgh, but they do pretty well.  It's really like if my slovak grandma and some frou frou chef decided to open a spot. Sounds cute, right? Now if only babi started making her spritzers with pandan.",

The service all around from staff was excellent and cheerful. Good vibes definitely rub off.   The pork cheeks to start were delicious. Tender and juicy and seasoned right.

My sample of the dish revealed a balanced combination of flavors, but was a bit heavy to begin the day. I didn't partake, but The Commoner brunch also boasts a Bloody Mary bar, with loads of fixings.  I was also able to try a main course, the onion soup burger. The sandwich was good, but didn't carry the classic French onion flavor I had hoped for. The fries that accompanied the burger were fine.

    "text": "Last week I had been thinking about how I had not had a really good Sunday brunch in awhile so I, on a whim, decided to see if the new hot spot in town, The Commoner, had any openings for my bf and I for Sunday brunch. Luckily, we were able to be squeezed in at 1pm this past Sunday. It was very crowded upon arrival and we were put at a table that I felt was a bit too close to the surrounding tables on either side but being it was so crowded, we were ok with our location. Our server (I can't remember his name but he provided excellent service throughout our dining experience) came over quickly and greeted us, taking our drink order right away. After reading other reviews about their epic bloody mary bar (coupled with the fact my bf had NEVER had a bloody mary before-I know, the horror!) we both went with that. He chose the house Smirnoff vodka, but after hearing about their lemon-thyme, bacon, and rosemary infused vodkas, I had to go with the rosemary. It took quite a long time for him to bring over our vodkas, but once he did, we made our way up to the bar with gaping mouths-sausage, hard boiled eggs, bacon, and-get this-little grilled cheese sandwiches! I totally wish I would have taken more than one grilled cheese bite because WOW these were just such an amazing treat with the bloody mary! They had all kinds of spices, hot sauces, seasonings, pickled veggies, and multiple types of cheese too. Oh and a TON of olives-my favorite accompaniment to a bloody mary! To my rosemary infused vodka, I added smoked tomato juice, blue cheese crumbles, tobasco, green olives, and of course-a piece of a grilled cheese sandwich. My boyfriend chose to do blue cheese crumbles, tobasco sauce, bacon, and a grilled cheese sandwich. Now, it's our fault we both added a tad too much tobasco but other than that fact-OMG these were flippin' amazing! What a way to start out a phenomenal brunch!   For our meals, both my bf and I ordered the lamb beni (Braised lamb, house made English muffin, rosemary lamb jus). This dish came with diced potatoes sauteed with red peppers and onions too. The lamb was so tender and flavorful and the eggs on top were, as Christy C. commented, the most perfectly poached eggs I have ever seen! The english muffin was delicious too and was perfect for sopping up the egg yolk. It's very cool they make their own english muffins too! Both of us were full about half way through but we \"powered on\" and my bf completely cleared his plate eventually, while I only left behind a scant amount of potatoes. By the time we were finished eating, the place had cleared out and we were left with only two other tables for company if that gives any indication just how long it took us to power through the meal :) Both of us made the comment we would love to come back for dinner at some point in the future, however, I am thrilled to add another must dine at option to my usual brunch repertoire here in the \"Burgh.",

One big giant meh.  The pork belly Mac and cheese was more like a cup of soup.  Even as an onion lover, I thought the pearl onions could be toned down instead of the main part of the dish.  My friends pulled pork sandwich was barely bigger than a slider.  The fries were average at best.  Both of my dining companions said the best part of their meal was the bbq sauce on the side.  All in all not worth the price.  We were very disappointed and I don't see any of us returning when there are soooo many better options downtown.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, but it just wasn't in the cards. The space itself is so super cool- so hip- that I thought I was going to love it.  The interior is slightly below street level. The lights are dim and the decor is dark and kinda romantic. It definitely has the feel of a restaurant that I would enjoy.   When I finally went for dinner, I found it to be \"just okay.\"  I really was expecting to be blindsided by amazing flavors and creativity, but I just wasn't blown away by the food.  Let me that the drinks that I started off with were fantastic.  I had the champagne cocktail with bitters (yum!) and then the hibiscus gin and tonic (double yum and so pretty!).  Both drinks put a nice little smile on my face, as neither was overly sweet.    We ordered shrimp for an appetizer, which was good, but heavily breaded.  For dinner I had brussels sprouts and the crab shells and cheese. I  would have enjoyed my meal more if everything hadn't been so oily and incredibly heavy.  The sprouts were literally soaked in olive oil and the crab shells were more slimy than cheesy.  Neither dishes were home runs for me at all.   Maybe it's my fault for not looking at the menu prior to dinner, but I was disappointed in how limited the selection was for those who don't eat red meat.  However, taking into consideration that this is a new restaurant, I'll definitely give it another shot.  When I do, I hope that it will be a five star review!",

    "text": "If I had walked in and gone straight to the table, this would have been a 5.   But I went to the bar first...and had to deduct a star because of it.  I almost deducted two.       Let's start with the dinner.  The table was roomy and comfy for our party of 7.   The menu looked great and I wanted to order a whole bunch of stuff.   I pared it down to the Brussels sprouts and the harissa skirt steak with fries.   The Brussels were great - charred, but will just a little crunch left - and were served in a cute cast iron crock.   The entree was ample and equally delicious.  I ate every bite even though it was really very large.  The steak had a nice flavor and was cooked nicely.   What topped off that dish though was the house made steak sauce.  It was served in a little ceramic gravy boat shaped like a cow.  I finished the madness off with the white pot, which was good, but not something I would order again (mostly because I sampled the sticky toffee pudding and it was way better).    My companions had the crab mac and cheese (solid, but not my fave), the short rib pot pie (I didn't try it), and a burger (also didn't try it).   We also sampled some wine, champagne cocktails, and a few beers - all good options.  Service was excellent.  Katie Z was very helpful and attentive and we had several others come to help with water, plates, etc.     So what was up with the bar?   Fruit flies and a smell, that's what.   When I sat down, I kept getting a waft of something stale (maybe a clogged drain or a dirty drink well?).  And then I look and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Crawling on the drink well and the bar tools, etc.    Gross.  The bar staff seemed oblivious and were not taking any steps to mitigate it at all.   I was not very excited to dine after seeing all that, but I had a group of friends coming and decided to suck it up.  The dinner won me over, but they need to get that bar situation under control before I'd want to go back.",

All the dishes had some aspect of it I didn't think I would enjoy. I requested the shortrib mac with a different cheese because I can't stand bleu cheese (and what mac and cheese ever has bleu in it, for real?). She gave me a substitute and I chose Gouda. It was marvelous! I told the chef and she said I was a genius for changing it out! I don't like how expensive everything is either. Some plates are large, but you really don't know until you get it. The second time wasn't as good. I put in the same request and was told they could not substitute Gouda today because they don't have any. They offered the cheese sauce used for the kids dish. Didn't taste nearly as good and felt kind of cheap but still same price. Probably won't go back if I can't count on ordering the same thing which can't be a slam dunk every time, at least not at their prices.",

I think it differentiates the menu for other similar establishments downtown. I come for lunch often and during dinner this evening I had the lamb shank which was quite tasty with an interesting spin-cashews, barley and rubbed with Indian spices. It's not as hard to get into as meat and potatoes and I enjoy it almost as much if not equally. Would recommend them for large groups. Deff check out the bier garden upstairs for before/after dinner drinks. Great spot!",

    "text": "This restaurant definitely has a cool vibe and trendy feel.  The decor is amazing.   We came in on time for our reservations;  however, we were seated 45 minutes later. The manager was very kind, checked on us frequently, and bought our first round of drinks.  I got the Enoch's penicillin, which was pretty strong, but good.   When we were finally sat, we were greeted by our waitress. She was very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive our whole meal.   Our group is very close so I was able to have a little of everything. We started with pork cheeks and scotch deviled eggs. The pork cheeks were fantastic, a little pricey (you get about 4 bites), but that's expected at a place like this. The scotch eggs were extremely overpowered with horseradish. I like a taste of horseradish, but not that much. The people I was with loved them and are big fans. For all those who love horseradish, this is for you. I got the steak and ale pie. The meat was tender and the flavor was good, but it was extremely salty. I also think mine was a little over done because the top seemed a little burnt (see picture). My friends got the strip steak, onion soup burger, and Pa burger. The Pa burger was my favorite, meat was tender and flavorful, toppings paired wonderfully, and over all very well done. The onion soup burger was good as well, just not as good as the Pa burger. The steak was very tender and cooked well, a little under seasoned, but it came with a decent steak sauce. I usually prefer a well seasoned steak with no sauce, but that's just personal preference. I would say the belle of the ball was the sticky toffee pudding. People are not exaggerating when they say it is delicious. It is a must have.  I did order a salad, but some how it got looked over, which ended up being okay because that just saved me room for dessert.   Overall, this place is okay. The ambience is to die for.   The staff and the service was great. The long wait can happen anywhere and they handled it appropriately. The food, to me, wasn't really anything mind blowing, the only thing that blew me away was the sticky toffee pudding. I would definitely come here again, just maybe for brunch, or I would order something different.",

Do not sit near the entrance as they only have one door and it is cold in Pittsburgh.  Here is what we liked. Scotch Deviled Egg, it was a good Scotch egg with a flavorful yoke. The Cheddar and Meat board, Smoked Beef Tartars were Ok (as expected). You got to try the Wood Over Charred Cauliflower. It is different and nice. The Broccoli Cheddar Flat bread and French Onion soup were as expected. I would have liked to try the Brick Chicken and Steak & Ale Pie but ran out of time (we had to get back to DC). The wine list is OK. Would recommend it because they have a good veg selection and the food they make is good to awesome.",

    "text": "The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because of the sticky toffee pudding, which is a date cake with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream.  It's so rich and a large portion that I encourage folks to share.    Rest of my meal deserved a 2...maybe 3.  I went here with a friend for lunch and tried the Cauliflower sandwich which was totally underwhelming.  It needed a little something something...perhaps something pickled to offset the dry and monotone tastes of the hummus and cauliflower (they seriously had no flavor to them).  I thought the pesto would give it some flavor but the unflavored cauliflower and hummus overpowered the sandwich.    While we had no issues with the service from our waiter, I think this establishment needs to train their staff better on what is and not in their food.  My friend that I was with has a nut allergy (tree nuts) and when looking over the dessert menu I asked if the sticky toffee pudding has any nuts.  Our waiter responded yes and so I asked what kind as the description didn't mention anything about nuts.  He told us it had a \"date nut\"...ummm, what the hell is a date nut?!?  I told him that a date is a fruit but was second guessing myself since I didn't want my friend to have an allergic reaction.    When the dessert came, I tried it to see if it had any actual nuts in it or nut flavoring - both of which it did not contain.  My friend had some without any reaction because dates are FRUIT not nuts.",

    "text": "There's very little to rave about with The Commoner.   Sure, the drinks are good and the space and menu are on-trend, but the service and quality fall well short of anything deserving the hype that we'd been served before going.  The two things that I did enjoy were the \"Devils on Horseback\" (bacon-wrapped dates stuff with blue cheese) and the giant bavarian pretzel that comes with a beer cheese dipping sauce reminiscent of welsh rarebit cheese sauce. The pretzel was huge, buttery, and worthy of sharing amongst 4, but likely a bit overwhelming for only 2 people. Oh, and their hushpuppies were pretty good!  My main disappointment was the service. For lunch, our waiter had an attitude that made us feel like he had better things to do to accompany his unwelcoming dry personality. Not what you want to be greeted with on a first visit. In the evening, the hostess was absent (according to another employee who we had to hunt down to get a seat, she left work without anyone realizing). For a nightcap beverage, we were faced with impatient bartenders, taps that were down two nights in a row, and crowds of severely inebriated patrons. There's an arrogance amongst the staff that can quickly rub you the wrong way...at least it did for us on all 3 visits.   The food, overall, is average at best. The lamb burger, while ordered medium, was almost as dry as the bun it was served on. When reading the ingredients on the menu, I expected a bit more interest, but ultimately the only flavors I got were dry bun, lamb/beef burger, and goat cheese. The spicy broccoli I had for my side was so watery that any hesitation in reaching for the burger would've ended up with soggy broccoli bun. Disaster avoided. Our table ordered fish & chips and salads that didn't impress, either. The reaction of, \"it's okay,\" is definitely not a positive one. Factor in the inflated prices for being downtown and in the Hotel Monaco, and the tolerance for underwhelming food drops significantly.  Perhaps The Commoner was great when it first opened, but whatever luster it may have had is surely dulled now.",

The Sweater in Sweden was a fresh take on spiced cider, but maybe the best cider you'd ever have, like straight from the orchard.  The menu featured modern, creative versions of our favorite American foods, like Pork Belly Macaroni & Cheese and Steak & Potatoes. We started with the Mussels and a Cheese Plate. The buttery sweet-corn mussel broth should be served with a straw.  Entrees. I got the namesake burger with fois gras and duck fat fries, commandeered the unwanted over-easy egg off my friends Macaroni & Cheese, then had one the best burgers of my life. I am a burger researcher, a real Wimpy at heart, and this burger was top three of all time. Wifey got the NY Strip which was cooked to temp just as ordered, and phenominal! It may have been seasoned by God himself. Other-friend had the Black Market special of Wild Boar chops.   So then we order the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. Holy shitballs good.

    "text": "This restaurant is attached to the Kimpton  hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, where we were staying, so we gave this a try for Saturday morning breakfast. It was definitely OK, but there were a couple of negatives and I don't know if I would go there again if we found ourselves back in downtown Pittsburgh. It was a little dark in there, which I guess is not surprising since it is sort of technically in the basement.  I think the main things that put me off were that the kitchen was super slow in putting out our food. There really weren't that many people there, but we still waited about 20 or 25 minutes for pretty standard breakfast items (I had the two egg breakfast, while my wife had one egg with a side of potatoes). The kitchen is open so you can actually see the cooks working, and it didn't appear as though they were shortstaffed, so the slowness was a little puzzling. Also, I thought the portions were unacceptably small. The two eggs that came out for me actually seemed more like what you would get if you scrambled a single egg, and the portion of potatoes was also pretty small.   I will say though that the food itself was very tasty. It was seasoned very well, and we both really liked the potatoes, which were mixed in with red peppers, green peppers, and onions. The English muffin I had with my breakfast was delicious. Also, my breakfast came up with a meat item, but since I don't eat meat the server was nice enough to let me have the cup of fruit, where you usually have to choose between the fruit and something else.  So overall not bad, just a couple of little things that detracted from the overall experience.",

    "text": "This review is strictly for the desserts. My husband and I stopped in here after a dinner in Lawrenceville. A few friends of ours have recommended the Sticky Toffee Pudding, being that it is one of their all-time favorite desserts. This was was a perfect opportunity for us to stop in since we were craving something sweet.   It was a little later in the evening on a Sunday night and there was surprisingly a decent crowd, although not what you would call packed. My husband ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and I ordered the Pistachio Honey Crisp. The desserts here are ultra rich and extremely sweet, which is good but they get old after a while. I would say the desserts are really great for sharing and not for yourself. That's the mistake my husband and I made as our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. Plus we wanted to try more than one.   The Sticky Toffee Pudding was incredibly moist and paired well with the vanilla ice cream. As I mentioned earlier, super sweet. The Pistachio Honey Crisp was interestingly presented. The pistachio cream and chocolate mousse were piped onto the plate and the two pieces of honey tuile were stacked onto each other diagonally like the roof of a house. The tuile seemed to be like a candied slab of phyllo dough. There also was some type of white chocolate bark with pistachios atop the cream and mousse. I loved this dessert but definitely better for sharing. After a while, it got to be too sweet and I just couldn't bring myself to finish it.   I would like to try the dinner menu, but I'm not sure how soon I'd come back considering the mixed reviews. The desserts were great and best when shared. Not bad!",

    "text": "My coworkers brought me to The Commoner, located within Hotel Monaco, when I visited Pittsburgh this past week. The Commoner was an excellent choice, and I would dine here again if I were to visit Pittsburgh another time. One of the reasons why I enjoyed dining at The Commoner was because of the ambience. I was immediately a fan of the hip gastropub due to its rustic, industrial-style interior, which was very fitting for a town known as \"Steel City.\"   Another reason why I would recommend this restaurant is because their menu showcases Pennsylvania products like PA Noble cave-aged cheddar, Castle Valley Mills cornmeal and locally ranched meats from Starr Valley Farms and Elysian Fields.   Not only does the menu feature local ingredients, but there are many traditional dishes such as smoked short ribs and pan-seared scallops, with interesting sides like spicy broccoli, duck fat potato wedges and curry roasted carrots and peanuts.  Besides serving up delicious farm-to-table eats, The Commoner offers a large bar with an array of signature cocktails, craft and imported beers and a range of wines from around the world.   When I dined here I ordered the Grouper which was served on a crispy carrot risotto cake with chorizo cream and garnished with radish and brussels leaves salad. The fish was fresh and crisped to perfection. For dessert, I ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was a steamed date cake with toffee sauce and rye vanilla ice cream. It was okay and lacked flavor. In general, the dessert menu could use help. Each dessert menu item consisted of fruit, and there were no chocolate or peanut butter dishes.   Although I was disappointed in the dessert menu, I was overall pleased with my experience at The Commoner.  If you are hungry for solid comfort food in Steel City, I recommend checking out The Commoner. You will leave full and satisfied!",

I love the look, feel, and energy of the restaurant.  The service and friendliness of the staff is always wonderful. I have tried a fee things on the menu...Steak Frites, Shepherds Pie, and Ribeye.  All were wonderful, but I'm very partial to a great Steak Frites and The Commoners version didn't disappoint.  This must be a crowd favorite because the bartenders told me that they would never take it off the menu....please don't...  They also have a very smart draft beer selection and change it through it the year.  The cocktails are amazing and the bartenders are True mixologists.   If you give them an idea of what you like..they will whip something up.  I'm a big Manhattan fan and these are amongst the best.  Commoner...see you on my next visit to Pittsburgh....",

I strongly reflects Pittsburgh in the decor with plenty of maps all over the walls. The menu has stylish food with a twist (sometimes).   Unfortunately I feel like its size and partnership with the hotel works against it. I'm not sure if everything is just not quite good enough to justify its cost, or if the price is just a bit high for what you're getting on each item, or really if there's a difference at all. I'm sure to cover such a large venue the prices need to be higher. And normally I wouldn't bat an eye at an expensive lunch, but it needs to have a bit of a wow factor for it.   The ambiance gets a 4, the food a 3, and the pricing a 2.",

I get other people might like that, but I'm not one of them, especially at 3 in the afternoon.  The general consensus was the the mid day menu sucked for food. Basically appetizers and a couple sandwiches. I get it's not a prime time of day to eat. I'm just relaying what I heard. I ended up ordering the tartare which I was happy with. Glad the quail egg was on there, I feel like a good tartare needs an egg. Could serve it with a few more slices of the toast, it's a good amount of meat and you need it. A lot of the girls ordered the chicken sandwich and weren't impressed. It was very dry and needed mayo or some kind of sauce. 2 of them actually said their jaws hurt from trying to chew it and one got cut on the roof of their mouth from the hard coating on the meat   We ordered a few of the specialty Pride drinks they were serving. Some were hits but most were misses. Marissa was our server and she was sweet.",

For a good (not amazing) breakfast we certainly paid a lot for it: egg white frittata, cup of fruit, Yinz' Need Breakfast, and two cups of coffee came out to about $60 bucks after tip. YIKES. You're paying for the ambiance of the Monaco Hotel and the chic bar, but that's a lot for breakfast without alcohol!  Glad we came, but wouldn't make it a habit to have breakfast here every day of a trip.",

I started with the Sex on the Mon Wharf cocktail and it was fab! A new twist on the classic version, the drink we fruity but not too sweet and garnished beautifully! They also offer a wide variety of beer and wine, as well.   My table shared the asparagus flatbread from the appetizers and it was phenomenal. Devoured in minutes!   For the main course, I had the grilled peach salad with a salmon and I might go out on a limb and say it's the best salad I've ever had. The salmon was cooked to my liking and the combination of grilled peaches with cheese and fruit was out of this world. 11/10.   Service was attentive but was disappointed that a table of four girlfriends received one check. I always appreciate when I don't have to ask for that; but certainly not a deal breaker. There's a parking garage right on Smithfield that's close and street parking if you can snag a spot!",

    "text": "Full disclosure, after a no-so-great experience back in 2017 we came back because the manager asked us to give them a second chance on our next visit to Pittsburgh. And we're sure glad we did.   We started with the wings and steak tartare. The wings were flavored with an herbaceous dry rub and have a light dipping sauce on the side. They were crisp and delicious. The tartare was amazing; we asked for more toast because we were savoring it.   For our entrees, we had the lobster rigatoni and the horseradish salmon. In spite of being an unconventional flavor combination, the red sauce and lobster worked very well. I'd highly recommend. The salmon was delicious with a flavorful crust.   For dessert, we shared the chess pie. Though rich, it was perfect for sharing.   At one point during the meal, we looked at each other and said \"I don't remember the food being this good!\"   All-in-all, the food and drinks--and in particular the service--were amazing and we were really happy to have tried the Commoner again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Pittsburgh.",

Took a bit to get me seated at the bar, but there were some seats available amongst the reservations. Though I still wonder why half the tables were seemingly empty...  Anyways, one of the staff members at the bar was quick to bring me water and then to take my order. There's a whole menu of cocktails and beers and other alcoholic beverages. They also have a few coffee options so I opted for the nitro cold brew. I also ordered the crab benedict to eat.   Both were very delicious options. The cold brew actually came out very light with a ton of foam on top, but then it settled into a darker color and some foam went away. It's definitely more bitter than one might expect but I like my coffee black anyways. The crab benedict was very good! Eggs were runny when poked, as expected, and there was a decent amount of crab. The dish came with a side of roasted potatoes cut into cubes. Very nicely seasoned and not too dry.   All in all, I enjoyed my meal and was very full by the end of it. Service was great as all the staff members at the bar were helpful and courteous.",

The restaurant has that industrial chic kind of look, and they really make use of the black wood, matte black metal, and old school type light fixtures. We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 9:15am and got seated immediately even without a reservation, just beware that pretty much all parking nearby is metered street parking.  We started off with their coffee, and dang is it strong in a good way! The dark roast coffee was very robust yet smooth, I wish I knew where to buy the beans from. Ordering from the brunch menu, we tried their smoked salmon blini, uncommon toast, brisket hash, and chicken & waffles. After trying everything, it was hard to pick a favorite! The smoked salmon was light yet rich in flavor, uncommon toast wasn't overly sweet yet had a nice pumpkin spice flavor, brisket hash was savory and unctuous from the perfectly cooked duck egg, and last but not least, the chicken & waffles were crispy yet sweet as it should be.  Overall the Commoner lived up to the hype! I highly recommend this place to others if you're in downtown Pittsburgh. I only wish they could open a location in Houston, Texas.",

Liked the dill cream cheese, but they slathered it on in a way that suggested they expected you to eat it sandwich style instead of open faced, which is how I prefer it. Nice side of fruit with it. Dinner was HUGE and I'd advise sharing an enteee if you have an appetizer. The flat bread is a misnomer--it was a big puffy hunk of dough, disappointing considering the name. The angry lobster pasta dish was very tasty but couldn't even eat half of it because it was so big. I ended up defying out the plentiful lobster and leaving the pasta after a few bites. Cheesecake Factory has nothing on these guys w/ the portions. Hubby's pork chop also looked like the thing they drop in Fred Fkintatone's car at the beginning of the cartoon. Just saying.",

I would say the pork belly was delicious and the steak was juicy and well made. The pappardelle was bland and would not recommend the fondue. I would recommend this as a nice place in the city but not the best food. It seats well and they have a large drink menu. I recommend this for sure because it is convenience in location too!

    "text": "Stayed in the Hotel Monaco for a night, and God forbid my wife and I don't check out the bar in any of the hotels we stay.     As soon as you walk down the stairs you're floored by how beautiful the space is.  Not sure what they paid for the fit-out, or if it was salvaged from a previous life, but it was stunning.  You're also immediately greeted by a hostess, or two I believe in this case, but we went straight to the bar.  Either way, they were eager to help.  As soon as we sat down we thought we were in trouble.  We asked to see the wine list, and he gave it to us while saying that the wines they offer by the glass are tap wines, and this was the best way to store a wine that has been opened.  And then lightly explained the science behind the tap/keg.  We're not wine snobs, but we do enjoy our wine and have a good size wine cellar.  The only tap wine I had ever had was nothing I would brag about, actually quite terrible.  But this was not the case here.  Not sure why their system was better than the ones I had previously tried, but these glasses tasted as if they were out of a freshly opened bottle each time.  So it's rare that you write three paragraphs without mentioning the best part.  In the case of The Commoner, and this is nothing against any other component of this review, it was Patricia.  What an amazing bartender.  Sometimes you get the bartender with a great personality, but can't get a drink right, but you're happy you can at least talk to them.  Or maybe you get an excellent drink, but the personality of a turnip.  Or you get the one that may know how to make a drink, or have a great personality, but gets in the weeds and can't get out - so you're sitting there waiting for your glass to refill.  Patricia has her mixology down to a science, is interesting and also hilarious to talk to, and you can genuinely tell she enjoys her job.  I don't know what her end game is, and I'm sure she's killing it in Pittsburgh, also not saying NY is better, but she could seamlessly end up behind a bar in NYC and be the star of the show.  Hope The Commoner knows what they have.  So after a few hours of just drinks on Saturday night, we came back for brunch the next day.  My wife went with some sort of granola yogurt combo, with a homemade English Muffin.  I went with a charcuterie plate - nothing special, and I'm pretty sure it was missing the pate, unless I misread.  Although my order was a bit less than I expected, it wasn't shockingly awful - just below an average plate.    Grad a seat by the bar and you'll do great.  If you're lucky, you'll get Patricia.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for The Commoner based on other reviews from various sources. I went for lunch to try to Lamb Hash and was surprisingly disappointed. The hash came on a huge, dry bun, which made each bite about 80% bread. It would have been better if the lamb hash had a strong flavor, but it was very bland and also a little dry. I tried salting it a bit, but then it was just salty and dry.   It came with a side of greens which was alright. I personally am a fan of simple salads, but the dish as a whole had no distinct flavors that stood out. Eventually I ditched the bread and ate the hash on it's own, which was an improvement. The best part of my meal was the brussels sprouts I stole off my friend's plate. His open-face turkey sandwich was actually pretty good. It tasted like Thanksgiving on a bun, and the sprouts had a good balance of flavor and texture.   Their beer selection was good. I was told to stay away from their cocktails, so I was happy with the beer. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly. No complaints there.  I may consider giving this place a second chance, but you would have to twist my arm quite a bit. Overall this was a let-down.",

    "text": "Visiting friends in Pittsburgh and planned a brunch get-together for six on at a far-too-early hour on Saturday morning. Living near the Hotel Monaco in Alexandria, Virginia, and being a fan of its Jackson 20 restaurant, we were very excited to try the new location in Pittsburgh. The hotel lobby was gorgeous with a very unique hanging chandelier, and the restaurant itself balanced Pittsburgh's steely stoicism with the fanciful Prohibition-style decor that I associate with Kimpton locations around the DC Metropolitan area.  The restaurant wasn't too busy and the hostess was happy to seat us despite two in our party running late. The four of us ordered drinks while we waited--two Pimm's Cups and two \"Man-mosas,\" or traditional mimosas with a splash of Grand Marnier, that I sometimes order at Jackson 20. The drinks took about ten minutes, but we were still waiting on the last couple to arrive so it wasn't too noticeable. The Pimm's Cups were delicious, but the Mimosas a little too orange juicy and served with a full shot of Grand Marnier on the side rather than a splash in the cocktail. While I knew this spelled trouble and was prepared to switch my drink order, the third couple excitedly joined us with the \"Man-mosas,\" unknowing that each cocktail would be billed at $10 for the mimosa and $12 for the Grand Marnier.  Our server was very attentive and happy to split the bill between the couples from the start, so we ordered in suit. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, knowing which items could be prepared gluten-free and while the rest of the table was ordering eggs and pancakes, we opted to share the Foraged Wild Mushroom Soup [without the croutons], the Local Farm Tomatoes salad, and the Mussels [despite using beer in the base of the broth]. The soup was delivered with the croutons, which we spooned out, and was very good. The tomato salad had a very light buttermilk ranch drizzle. The sweetness of the dressing complimented the salty Pennsylvanian Amish blue cheese swimmingly. The mussels were a bit of a disappointment, tasting generic and under-seasoned, and a few of the mussels had not opened up. The mussels would also benefit by being served with a bowl for the shells, which quickly piled up on the side of the salad plate.  Our second round of cocktails was better than the first, and luckily no one at the table told me it was far too early for a traditional Last Word. The Bloody Mary had a little more olive brine than I might have liked, but the rest of the table enjoyed them and there is a full Bloody Mary bar for the creative.  Overall, brunch was good with the highlights being the space and service. I wouldn't perhaps recommend ordering off menu or you may be surprised with a $22 cocktail or soup with floating croutons. We may check out the rooftop biergarten or try dinner at the restaurant the next time we are in the Steel City.",

We were quickly told without reservations we were limited but we promised to eat quickly and we were seated immediately.

We had wanted to go back to Meat and Potatos for the Bloody Mary bar brunch, but they were booked weeks in advance, which turned out to our benefit because we ended up at the Commoner instead. I had seen some friends posts with delicious looking cocktails so decided to check it out. We got in with no wait. I'm not personally a huge Blood Mary fan, although I do enjoy a Bloody Caesar, but even I was impressed with the Bloody Mary bar and their extensive option or mixes and toppings. The atmosphere was sort of industrial chic, with an open kitchen, it's a large space just below street level with sidewalk view windows. There is a large bar and plenty of seating, we sat at a table as a group of 8. We actually started out as a group of six around 10:30am on a Saturday, we had a few rounds of Craft cocktails/bloody Mary's that did not disappoint and likewise the food was great. It was actually so good that when the fourth couple who was coming later showed up around 1:30 we decided to stay for a second round of food and drinks from the midday menu. In a town that has a lot of great food options, anyplace that's good enough to convince my crew of foodies to stay for multiple meals in one day is a five star joint.",

    "text": "Stopped in on Saturday for lunch with my girlfriend around 2pm.  It was my first time visiting and she had recommended it based on a couple things - the interior is beautiful and the menu has interesting combinations, which seem to be enticing upon glancing through.     We immediately ordered coffee and when that was brought, we requested the sweet potato bisque to start. The best part of our meal was this dish - it was really the only redeeming quality of our experience at The Commoner. Honestly, we did not see much of our waitress during the meal. Since we have both worked as servers, we chalked this up to having something to do with the slow time between lunch and dinner. But, we specifically said we were almost ready to order the meal as we placed the soup order - and only needed a minute. We did not see her again until about 10 minutes later when our soup was finished.  Eager to order our food, we requested a medium rare steak and the cauliflower -shouldn't take long right?     Wrong again - we waited almost 25 minutes for that food to come out.  In last 5 minutes of that time frame, we watched our $28 steak die under heat lamps (restaurant kitchen is open concept/in plain view) - while it waited for the crispy (real talk -- fried) cauliflower.  Confused about the kitchen and waitstaff logic at this point.  Still - after the undesired wait - we ate the luke warm and overcooked steak. The menu listed pomme frites + foie gras butter + petite salad.  We were not expecting frozen out of a bag cheap french fries with 2 sprigs of spider lettuce thrown on top. I would honestly have preferred Wendy's fries to these cheap frozen \"frites\".  The cauliflower was pretty good but, the experience had been soured by the wait time and the terrible excuse for $28 lunch steak that was presented to us.    The one mistake I made in the experience was not saying something when the waitress asked how the meal was.  I simply replied \"good\" and asked for the check-  I am always hesitant to complain when being served. I do not like to leave bad reviews because it can seem unfair based on ONE experience-  However, at this point my girlfriend and I are waiting again- for the check.  Discussing how let down we were with the whole thing- Then it all came together when she admitted that she was afraid this might happen---Confessing her TWO prior experiences here had terrible service encounters. She was a waitress at the time and assumed it was just poor luck.    Bottom line: Third time's a charm. This establishment is missing a lot of crucial parts to charge the $$$ for the experience they are pretending to create.",

    "text": "I purposefully didn't read the reviews beforehand so my experience could be completely unbiased. There is quite a buzz about this place among friends and colleagues but once I went -- and then read through the reviews -- ugh, I have to side with the majority of the reviews.   Ambience  5 Drinks        5 Service   3.5  Price          2 Food       N/A  My gf and I met for drinks after work on a Thursday. No happy hour specials. Bummer.  Three bartenders with 3/4 of the bar full and it took entirely too long for someone to approach us. Throughout our time there, two of the bartenders seemed aloof and not very personable. The female was the nicest and most attentive. She accidentally squirted beer all over me when a tap went out. Instead of getting me a napkin right away she sat there and cleaned off a glass and chatted with another worker. We had to ask a second time. But she did end up rectifying it later on at the end of evening so that's why service got the extra 1/2 point.   I was hungry but after reviewing the menu and the prices I opted to wait until I got home to eat. Not many options that appealed to me for one. And I realize we are in a nice hotel downtown but $17 bucks for a plate of cheese? The average price for a \"nibble\" was $17.   The drinks were the best part of the night for me. Although they forgot the garnishments on my friends' drink and we couldn't get their attention for so long she just said forget it. I got the Fortunato cocktail and it was absolutely delicious.  Milargro Blanco Tequila, Lime, Cherry heering, Lustau Amontillado Sherry, Cream Soda $13  I also got the Green Flash Passion Fruit Kicker (wheat ale)... fruity, refreshing, so flavorful I need to find out where I can get a case of this.   All in all, there are so many other establishments with good cocktails that have happy hour specials that I probably won't be going back here.",

I absolutely love the fact they offer bottle service for the bloody Mary's. This is one thing that does make the commoner brunch stand out from the rest. At $15 a piece for one Bloody Mary why not spend $58 on a bottle of grey goose and enjoy multiple. My friend and I made a total of 5 and had enough vodka leftover to make at least 1 if not 2 more.   As for the Bloody Mary bar itself, I didn't like it as much as some others I've tried. It's definitely nice that they have multiple tomato juice options such as original, smoked, and verde. However, I was not impressed with any of the 3 I tried. The toppings were definitely unique and they had a wide variety of hot sauces and spices to mix in.  The best part of my brunch was by far the entree. I got the pierogies and eggs. The day I went they were serving chorizo stuffed pierogies topped with poached eggs and verde sauce with a side of potatoes. Everything about this entree was spot on. The chorizo was no too spicy like some other chorizos that I don't like. The pierogies had more of a deep fried texture to them then a regular pierogi. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly and the verde sauce actually had flavor! Most places can't manage to make a good verde sauce but they did it.   This is one of those reviews where I wish we could give half star ratings. While I think a 3 sells the brunch a little short, I think a 4 is a little too generous. Combining both my dinner experience (see former review) and my brunch experience I unfortunately have to give it only a 3 star.",

My handy Yelp app said the Commoner was nearby and reviews looked good so off we went on a five minute walk on a cool April day. We soon discovered this is the restaurant attached to the boutique Hotel Monaco.   The waitress was great. Ordered coffee and ice water and they quickly appeared. I love it when they leave the pot of coffee on your table for refills. It was a tasty darker roast blend.   My lady ordered an egg white and veggie omelette. I ordered a Western PA omelette. A side of crispy bacon to share as well as a fresh OJ.   The verdict? The food was good. My lady loved her omelette. The lunch meat ham heavy omelette didn't cut it for me nor did the non fresh squeeze tasting OJ. The bacon was good. The toast not very toasted.potatoes were good.   The fact this cost top dollar is the reason I'm not cutting slack here. We don't mind paying for top notch food that is worth it. Call it three stars or okay. Expected more but it was a good place to eat. At least the food wasn't microwaved.",

Our waitress was super nice in answering all of my questions and made sure to get an accurate answer from the kitchen instead of guessing which was so appreciated.   The meal itself was amazing. I had the butter lettuce salad (no cheese, add steak, bearnaise instead of sherry vinaigrette). I want to recreate it at home it was so good.   Paleo/Whole30 tips: all their dressings are made with olive or canola oil (no soy) and the bearnaise and hollandaise are both made with clarified butter.

Met my husband for our anniversary dinner on Saturday night; we always do mussels to celebrate because that's what we had on our first date. We had had them here before  but didn't see them on the menu.  We asked our waitress Stephanie about the mussels and she said that  they weren't on the dinner menu right now, but sometimes they are served as a special. I guess they change the menu pretty frequently here.  Hubby and I decided to finish our cocktails and search for mussels somewhere else.  When we asked for the check, Stephanie returned and asked if we were leaving because of the mussels and I explained that it was our anniversary and mussels are kind of our thing for our anniversary.    She immediately recommended a restaurant close by that she said had great ones, and even came back with the restaurant name and address written down for us!  I thought this was so nice, as we only got two drinks and took a while and then didn't even eat. Definitely left a good impression and made me want to come back another night.  But put the mussels back on the menu! They were SO good. Also the beer list is great, I definitely would come back for that since I had a cocktail this time! Ask for a corner booth, they were taken so we couldn't sit there but they're definitely the best for a romantic date night!!",

I had brunch with my girlfriends here this past Saturday and while the atmosphere and company I was with were great, that's about the extent of my great experience.  Our waitress was nice, but not super polite.  Seemed overwhelmed/annoyed by our group of 6.  Our drinks were OK. Waitress seemed to be pushing $11 glasses of Bellinis on us.  With the garnish in the flute taking up most of the room, I could've finished it in one gulp. It was just OK. I had a bloody mary with the pickle infused vodka.  Also just OK. Drinks took absolutely forever to come out. We were one of just a few other parties there, and I would hate to see it on a busy day or night.  Around the table, we ordered the burgers, crab cake Benedict, pierogis and eggs and I had the Western PA omelette that came with potatoes.  No complaints about any meals, but they, again, were just OK.  At $18 for an omelette, I would expect something slightly more than what I believe were frozen potatoes. They were not seasoned.  I have had far better omelettes and potatoes at Pamelas or.....Eat n Park to be honest.  Presentation was boring which was also disappointing given the trendy atmosphere  It was fine, but that's about as good as I'll give it.  For nearly a $50 tab just for myself having two drinks and an average meal, I didn't find it worth it. Couldn't even get a pretty food picture out of it.  Again, if I were having drinks before or after a dinner reservation elsewhere, I might have different thoughts because it seems they have interesting/fun cocktails and an extensive bar menu, but the food and experience for brunch missed the mark for me.",

All in all, a good dinner spot, and the bill was $106 without tip.",

I had a beer and a couple whiskies from Wigle Distillery. My fiancee had one of their signature cocktails. She didn't like it so the bartender kindly offered to make her something different.  The service was very attentive and quick. Great restrooms and they're open until 2 am on Fridays.",

    "text": "I was here last weekend with my boyfriend and another friend. We booked a table for Friday night dinner. Our experience was decidedly less frustrating than last time, hence the updated rating. Our server was attentive, looking into my entree being made dairy-free, and recommended some excellent cocktails from the list. I went with their high-end take on the cosmo (not my usual drink by any means) and was taken aback by how much I enjoyed it.   I ate the burger again and it was even better than last time. My boyfriend had the lobster Bolognese and loved it, minus the odd addition of green peas. When he mentioned that in passing to a manager, he was given another serving to-go, sans peas! It's those details that make you want to come back to a place. I'll gladly add The Commoner to our favorite downtown restaurants rotation after this last visit. Next time we may come in for brunch!",

My mom had a Grey Goose Cosmo and I had the Mixing Vodka and Emotions (on the recommendation of the bartender!). The drinks were wonderfully prepared and mine was absolutely delicious. The best part about the Mixing Vodka and Emotions was the matcha ice cube, as it melts it turns the drink slightly creamy!   We decided to order a little charcuterie cone and some potato chips. The order came out quickly and was lovely! The mustard sauce was delicious.   Definitely worth a stop-in for a delicious craft cocktail and a bite to eat! So happy this is conveniently located in The Monaco!",

Sweet.  Got there and there was tons of space. Nice atmosphere and pleasant staff as well. We had the chicken & waffles, French toast, burger, and crab Benedict. All were excellent! The burger was on the average side but good nonetheless.   Everything is a bit on the pricey side but all the portions were the perfect size. The French toast was heavy so I wouldn't recommend eating it alone, it's good to share. The crab Benedict was delicious. It had just the right amount of crab!   I would recommend!

The atmosphere was that of a modern golden age with a bit of a speakeasy feel. While i cannot brag about everything we enjoyed tonight, here are a few things I recommend you try; The Butter Lettuce salad with radicchio, grape, pear, cashew, blue cheese an aged sherry vinaigrette with marinated pan seared tofu. I know you are thinking,  really, a salad... but his particular salad had so much flavor and it was big enough to be your whole meal. Everything was so fresh and crisp each ingredient elevating the others as they danced on my pallet. By far this was one of the best salads i have had in a long time.  Next I had the Milk & Honey Pork Belly which was listed as an appetizer but I ordered this as my entree and it did not disappoint.  A nice chunk of pork belly that has been braised in milk and then had the cap seared and glazed with honey that makes for a perfectly crisp and toothsome bite.  This is  the perfect balance of sweet and savory pork longs for.  The meat beneath was perfectly tender and moist ready to lovingly caress the creamy smoked cheddar grits and rich pan sauce that surrounded it.    I would go back and have these things again tomorrow but there is so much more to explore here. My friends also had several other tasty treats that I shamelessly requested they snap photos of. If you are ever in Pittsburgh i recommend you stop in.",

I loved this place the first time on my first visit to Pittsburgh last year, so much so that on my second visit I had to make sure we stopped in for a proper breakfast. This place did not disappoint.   I had the Yinz Need Breakfast which came with a \"homemade\" English muffin which was fresh and warm like it had just come out of the oven. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy just the way that I liked it, and my meal came with enough bacon to feed a family of four. My meal came with so much food that despite being stuffed, I had enough food to take home and have later for second breakfast.  My brunch companion was French and a quiche connoisseur and had only high praise for the ham, cheddar and chive quiche which she said was velvety, creamy and delicious. We also ordered the fruit salad as  bonus plate to share. While we enjoyed the medley of melon, strawberry, cantaloupe, blackberries and blueberries, the ricotta under the fruit seemed a little out of place, ...  I would have preferred just a plain greek yogurt.   We did not order drinks this time around but on my last visit I tried the Bloody Mary bar which was incredible.   If in downtown Pittsburgh be sure to stop by and try this place out, you will not be disappointed.",

Honestly, yes, it is a little more on the pricey side... however, for the price you get a good sized brunch. I had the pierogi and eggs, it was simply divine. My friend had the salmon, and loved it! They also have really good immunity/health \"shots\" as well as incredible cold brew coffee! I will most certainly be back as I was instantly hooked after just one bite. I'd also suggest looking at the drink menu if you're in the mood for something outrageous and unlike any other bar in Pittsburgh. Can't wait to go again.  ____________________________________________________________ Update, I AM IN LOVE with this place... not even just love anymore! I am now gluten and dairy free and they made me a lamb burger on gluten free bread and made sure my meal was gluten free. Wow are they amazing here! Also, the lamb burger is amazing in general. So good and cooked so well. I love knowing there's a place in Pittsburgh THIS GOOD.",

The crab Benedict was okay, the poached eggs were done nicely, and they weren't bad, but the potatoes tasted mediocre and were cold.    They did have a pretty cool looking Bloody Mary bar.

The fact that the pop up bar was awful really started our night on the wrong foot. My friend and I stood in line for about 40 minutes to get to the front of the line. Once we were in the pop up bar it was extremely disappointing. Yes, the names of the drinks were cute and clever but they were all pre mixed, and about 2 ounces for $10. We got a drink; and quickly left. We weren't impressed with that at all.    Dinner! We walked downstairs and were pleasantly surprised the wait on a Friday night was only about ten minutes. We got to sit at the chefs table which was super awesome, we were able to see where the food was prepared. It was super clean and all of the chefs seemed super laid back even though they were slammed with orders.   I ordered the catch of the day, and it was good! A little fishy for me, but it was my first time having that type of fish. My friend got the lamb burger and said it was a-ok, she ended up getting bacon and egg when she didn't ask for it but I guess it was just \"too much\". Our favorite part was the scotch eggs! I do highly recommend them. They were made with duck, rather than pork. They are also in a curry paste! Yum!  Finally, our server (sigh) had the worst attitude from the second she walked up to us that night. She read Off the specials so fast and when I asked her to please repeat what she had said (for both specials) you would have thought I asked her for $1,000. We felt rushed, and u attended to.  Would come back for brunch, but not for dinner again. There are tons of restaurants just like this in the city.",

    "text": "I just went to The Commoner for the first for dinner last night and it was a wonderful experience. I had made a reservation and we were promptly seated by a friendly host. Our waiter was very attentive and our food came out incredibly quickly (I caveat this statement with the information that we were there at 5:15pm, just after it opened for dinner). There was a Pens game at Consol that night and our waiter asked if we were going to make sure we were out on time if we were going. The food was really excellent. I especially loved the \"to share\" asparagus with poached egg plate. I was pleasantly surprised to find the high attention to detail at the restaurant, which manifested itself when I was brought curry powder and chili oil fresnos for my Tikki Masala when I asked for additional spiciness and the way in which my leftovers were boxed, with plastic laid down at the bottom of the paper box to prevent leaking and herbs carefully sprinkled on top. My only disappointment is the lack of vegetarian options on the menu, but they were very accommodating and made a flatbread without the meat for my sister. The prices are on the higher side, but worth it for the quality of food you are getting. I will definitely be going back!",

(maybe before a game?) ~Cheddar Board: cheese selections were terrific. Then add in that apple butter and dried fruit and bread and O.M.G.  We were arguing over who got the last pieces. :)  ~Onion Soup: we ordered it 2 nights in a row. a little salty, but good. ~Steak & Ale Pie: Hellz yes. That was seriously delicious. **Yep, it's super loud in there. Ask the hostess to put you in the back of the restaurant, much, much better. But if you can't hear each other, so what? Take in the really awesome design of the room. (with the steel girders echoing the heritage of Pgh) and the staff's uniforms (which i LOVED). If you have time,  GO UPSTAIRS and dig on the biergarten; it must be terrific because we were guests of the hotel and we still had to get on a wait list.  Overall, If I still lived in Pittsburgh, this would definitely be my pre-game or post-game spot. Loved it!",

My main deterrent for 4 stars vs. 3 was our server, though he was a nice guy, the wait times were really awkward and getting our cheeseboard only moments before our meals really sucked.  We eventually could tell the waiter totally forgot to order it when we ordered our drinks. Sometimes it's hard to eat out as a former waiter, like I know I would have done a lot more to rectify that disappointing sitch...with the price points on this menu and an early 6:30 reservation we shouldn't feel rushed and like we're left waiting at the same time.  Def worth a visit, though it didn't quite charm me the way I had hoped it would.  Maybe next time I make it through the Pittsburgh rotation of awesome eats.",

They both said the turkey was very moist and not drive at all.  I had the brisket sandwich with onions on top. Sandwich also came with a Small salad. It was a good sandwich. I would definitely consider coming back to this place again.  I absolutely love the Decour in the buildout was absolutely phenomenal inside the space. My only complaint was the noise level was a little bit louder so if you're going there for a business meeting it may not be the best place just because of how loud it is.  I can definitely see coming to this place for drinks after work or even happy hour.",

Our server Jordan made excellent recommendations, & provided excellent service. He even had a candle in the AMAZING sticky bun cake dessert that we ordered, & sang a little birthday song. Our first round of drinks included the old fashion & a brumble something or other? I cant remember but it was a very good drink recommendation, it ended up being my favorite drink of the night For our second round we had a Manhattan & a pickled chili pepper martini. We went big for appetizers, everything sounded so good. Pesto crusted bone marrow, smoked beef tartare, liver mousse, French onion soup, oysters on a half shell, & braised pork cheek. The tartare was my favorite, but I'm biased as I LOVE tartare. The next best picks were the mousse, bone marrow & oysters. For our main course, we shared the Lamb Shank & crab mac & cheese. The lamb was so tender, every bite just melted. The crab mac & cheese seemed a shade too salted, even for having seafood in it, but it was STILL good. Believe it or not, me & my brother alone ate every single bite! I will absolutely be recommending this place!",

    "text": "I walk down Strawberry Way every day after work as I head from the US Steel Tower to my bus stop, so I've been passing by the windows that look down into The Commoner for months now. I have been so eager to try it after basically watching its construction, and especially since the interesting lighting and finishes were installed.  My roommate's mom was in town visiting this past weekend, and we decided on The Commoner for dinner after an afternoon spent at the orchid and bonsai show at Phipps. You enter the restaurant through the main entrance of the Monaco hotel which seemed very interesting in itself, with a very unique (and huge) chandelier of dried flowers hanging in the lobby. I loved the style of the restaurant; the dark finishes and low lighting give it a upscale feel, but the high ceilings and general spaciousness keep it from becoming stuffy. We were loving the hardwood floors which looked as though they had been branded with a geometric pattern. Very interesting and different.  We took a chance by walking in right after opening (5PM) on a Sunday and were told there were no open tables due to reservations (I guess they are doing well!), however there were ample bar and kitchen-view seating options available. We chose to sit overlooking the kitchen, which was actually a pretty entertaining experience. It was kind of like watching Food Network, except in real life--no complaints here!  We started with the daily oysters and the brown butter Brussels sprouts. I am by no means an expert on oysters, so I don't remember the specifics of that day's selection, but they were great. Presentation was also great, and we enjoyed the pickled vegetables that were served as a garnish. The sprouts were buttery and delicious, and there were plenty to split between three of us.  I had the steak and ale pie for my entree, consisting of braised short rib and vegetables in a delicious and flaky suet crust. Perfect comfort food! The crust was perfectly baked and the filling was piping hot. I loved the cute penguin pie vent! The meat was tender and practically falling apart. The gravy was also delicious. The pie was the perfect size--I had no trouble finishing it by myself.  I enjoyed all of this with a gin and tonic, made with the Commoner House tonic. They also offered an Elderflower tonic, which sounded great as well. Nice selection of cocktails--I will definitely be bringing some coworkers here sometime for a post-workday cocktail.  Overall I really enjoyed the food, the friendly service, and the ambiance. The Commoner is already a new favorite of mine and I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

Thanks...I will be back to the very exceptional Commoner for many more delightful experiences.  Thanks!  Valoree",

    "text": "Great meal at The Commoner. Had an absolutely delicious Burger from the \"Linner\" menu before a 5pm flight. Burger was one of the best I have ever had! Fries were good, but the topper was the \"Roasted Yellow Tomato Ketchup\" that typically tops the burger. I ordered the burger with no bun, and the presentation was excellent. The burger did not need a bun, it certainly stood up well on it's own.   Great ambiance in the space that is part of the Hotel Monaco. Server was attentive and pleasant. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "My family and I were staying at the Kimpton Hotel: the Hotel Monaco, and we went to the Commoner for dinner. First, there were not many options for kids; there were the basics, hamburger, grilled cheese, and pasta. I ordered a hamburger, and when it came out, looked like a coal pancake. It was completely blackened, and had a foul taste. Both of my friends meals were not pleasing. We got a free dessert, and we chose the strawberry banana ice cream. My father, who thinks that even a McDonalds vanilla cone is a V.I.P dessert, said the ice cream was disturbingly disgusting. It tasted like cherry cough syrup, was thick, and was sticky. Is The Commoner posing as a great hotel restaurant? Will it soon die down? Yelp readers, unite!",

    "text": "Loved this restaurant. We had just got into Pittsburgh and were staying at a nearby hotel. We did a quick search on yelp and The Commoner popped up as the closet restaurant so we decided to check it out.   We went with two young children and when we first walked in I was a little concerned that this place may be a bit too fancy for us, as it seemed filled with business people enjoying cocktails. When we asked for a table and they pulled out the children's menus I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a salmon special and my wife the striploin steak both were delicious. The waiter was AMAZING with my two boys who were a little weary after a long drive, he had them laughing when ever he came by which was greatly appreciated. We had the sticky toffee for desert which is something I wouldn't normally order but based on the reviews felt I had to try, and it was delicious.   Overall I would highly recommend this place, and for parents reading this don't be scared off by the low lighting and business crowd. Take the kids and enjoy a well cooked meal. It was probably our favorite meal during our time in Pittsburgh.",

Our meal was terrific and Jeff was an awesome waiter. He joined our conversation in such a fun and friendly way and offered great menu suggestions. Cocktails and wine served quickly and the Brooklyn was a great take on my usual Manhattan. Apps were delicious. We had the gravlax which was not salty at all and the cheese platter which had a great assortment. Entrees also diverse and served with perfect timing, not too fast or too slow. I loved the vegetarian tikka masala and heard the short ribs were great. Jeff was kind enough to escort my friend to a nearby ATM so she didn't have to walk alone. Granted things had quieted down at the restaurant by this time or I'm sure he wouldn't have been able to do this. Finished off the night sharing the pudding as recommended by so many other reviewers. This Ravens fan totally enjoyed this hotspot in Steelers country!",

Would definitely eat here again were I ever to return to Pittsburg.   Drank a cappuccino, was nice and foamy.   I had the Mess Beni. It was a little on the greasy side due to the chorizo, but had a good spicy kick to it. My fiancee had the Pub Toast, which was French toast made w soda bread. It wasn't to his liking--he prefers an 'egg-ier' French toast, and the soda bread just didn't seem to soak up any egg. He'd eat here again, but would order differently.  Overall, it was an enjoyable and tasty meal. The Commoner is a brunch spot worth checking out!",

    "text": "Had I written this review last year, I would have given it 5 stars. Our service was amazing and the food was solid. They even called me beforehand to ask how old my husband was turning (it was a birthday dinner) so they could put a little Happy Birthday sign on the table. It was all the little extra touches that had me excited to go back, but I had such a different experience this past week. It was as if I was at a completely different restaurant! I'm giving it two stars instead of one because the food was decent, but that's where my good experience ends.   Here's a summary of my experience: -Came 5 minutes early and was told our table wasn't ready and that we were early. It was said in a really condescending way. After waiting 15 minutes after our reservation, we were finally seated, after my husband talked to them. -Our server seemed rather lifeless. He never introduced himself, rarely smiled, and never came to ask us how our food was during our meal. At one point during our meal, he did refill our water, but he literally didn't say one word. What a perfect opportunity to, oh I don't know, ask us how it's going.  -The service was also slow. We waited long periods of time before we would see our waiter to get drinks or order food. He would ask if we needed another minute to look at the menu and then come back a long time after that. I think at one point he forgot to bring us out our drinks until I made eye contact with him across the restaurant. We were there almost 3 hours despite eating at a normal pace. -The bathroom was disgusting. Someone clogged the toilet, but there was no sign or any warning to avoid that stall. What a great picture to see while dining! I let the host know, and apparently house keeping had been informed 20 minutes prior. I seriously wish I could have been spared from seeing that (it was bad), but no one thought to close off that stall. When I went back to the bathrooms, there was basically no toilet paper. I found enough for me, but the poor lady after me....There was toilet paper littered in the stalls. There were paper towels littered on the ground by the sink. One of the soap dispensers was broken. I'd expect all of this maybe at McDonalds, but not here. It was a real turn off.   Those are just some of the specifics that happened to us. Judging from some of the other one and two star reviews though, it seems like poor service is a common theme here. No amount of good food makes up for poor service in my book. It really was off putting and I left upset. What a night and day experience from last year!",

We had to order the flat bread because it look so good. We also had the bacon wrapped dates. Amazing!  We also tried the root salad and crab frites. Those were also delicious.

    "text": "This restaurant/bar has a nice feel to it when you walk in. It is dimly lit and the decor has an upscale NYC feel. On that note, I'd like to point out that this bar is not located in NYC and (that being said) I feel that their drinks are wildly overpriced. A bottom shelf vodka and coke was $13 for example. One of my friends ordered something pretty basic and it was around $20.   In addition, there are these two long tables that are positioned very close to the bar. During my visit, it was very crowded and people were literally smashed on top of each other. The waiters had to constantly remind people to stop setting their drinks on the two long tables as they were preparing to seat the tables for two parties that had made reservations. I walked around the non-bar portion of the restaurant and noticed that there was plenty of open space and potential for seating. I'm not sure why those two tables were placed so close to the bar.   As I wrote earlier I have only been here once but the crowd that I saw during my visit was \"older\". A lot of business people, women with caked on makeup and overdone hair, men who looked like they might smoke cigars and golf on the weekends, cougars and the such.... Mainly the sort of people that could afford overpriced drinks. I kind of felt like a turd in a punch bowl. I didn't get to try the food because I could only afford to nurse two drinks. Also, being crushed between some lady with a high pitched squeaky voice and some pot bellied dude with garlic breath wasn't fun. If you insist on giving this place a try I would avoid the bar area.",

I rdered a gin a house made tonic, it was pretty good, but I guess I am an old fashioned girl and would prefer my regular ol' Tanqueray and tonic.  For food, I ordered the steak and ale pie since I saw a lot of reviews on here and it looked amazing. Of course it was!! It had great flavor to it and it was the perfect portion size. My dad and girlfriend both ordered burgers, according to them they were over done (they both ordered medium) so if you are a person who likes pink/red do not order medium. Even just looking at the meat I could tell it was overcooked, but they both said the flavors were there and that it would be a perfect burger if it wasn't dry.   I would come here again and try something else. The ambiance was really great as well!!",

Five stars for amazing, attentive waitstaff who were friendly and welcoming - they always knew when to check on us without hovering too much.   The food was mostly pretty solid - we were there for breakfast on two days where we stayed at the Monaco - but I had egg dishes both days and the eggs were really, really watery and runny. That suggests to me that either they were prepared wrong, or that they came from some sort of prepared egg mix. This is a place that seemed very proud of its cuisine and I had assumed that we were talking about farm-fresh sourcing, but I am not sure that was at all the case.   It's a lovely space and we might give it another shot with friends sometime.",

We did not have a reservation (note: make one) but I think since we were checking out the space to have a work-related event - they bent over backward to accommodate the three of us.  This place is busy, so be sure to make a reservation.   Our waitress, Abigail (I think that was her name) was perfect in every way. Super friendly and efficient with just the right amount of personality to be charming and entertaining.   The space is beautifully renovated. The long communal table was made from a slab of marble. It is very bistro like - good energy - but not so loud that you have to shout to have a conversation.   I had the lamb hash - this was pretty great. Good flavor and the side salad was nicely dressed and a good contrast. I shared a side of fries - those are amazing and so was the house-made ketchup.   I also ordered a Bloody Mary - outstanding. OH, and that sticky toffee pudding everyone raves about? yeah, there's a reason for that... sooooooo good.   I am looking forward to coming back!",

My $12 coconut old fashioned was about an ounce of actual drink coupled with a lot of ice. My husbands $12 Pinot noir was half a normal serving at any other restaurant. The $9 deviled eggs and chi orzo sausage came as three and had the thinnest slice of sausage you could barely taste it. The PA burger was just ok.   All in all very disappointed in the Commoner. Will not recommend to anyone or be returning.   The hotel Monaco though was very appealing. It's nice to see a hotel like this in Pittsburgh.",

The atmosphere is simultaneously lively, upscale and modern with a cool vibe. The room is large, but still comfortable. The grand scale of it is visible descending the stairs from the hotel lobby, but once seated the comfort of the place make it feel almost intimate. In an era where places are trying to do outdo one another with cocktails, The Commoner has managed to produce some offerings that are both divine and different from the rest. The by-the-glass wine list is respectable too.  Cheese lovers shouldn't miss the cheddar board. I was impressed that an all-cheddar cheese board would be so good and interesting - the accoutrements were tasty as well. The broccoli cheddar flatbread was okay. The Scottish Cedar Plank Salmon and the Steak & Ale pie were both home runs, as was the cauliflower side. \"The Crumble\" dessert a combination of apples, butternut squash and lemon ricotta, was every bit as delicious as the combination is unique, and suitable for sharing as well. Service was flawless.  If you don't want to bother with the valet, I'd recommend parking in the nearby Mellon Square Garage operated by the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, which is almost just across the (side) street and is only $5 on evenings and weekends.",

I booked a reservation for 12:30 brunch today (Sunday). Throughout the meal, our waiter primarily ignored his tables and chatted with what I assume to be management throughout our meal. At one point, another patron actually got up to ask him for something because he had been so neglectful of his tables. I could see the waiter stand from my seat and watched him spend most of the time chatting. I typically tip 20 to 25% and he certainly did not receive that type of compensation for his blatant laziness.   The food was quite good. There are a wide variety of brunch and lunch options. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals. However, the timing of our food took exceptionally long for brunch and was debatably worth the wait. No apology from our waiter or assurance that our food was on the way. He wasn't paying any attention anyways.  The ambience goes without saying. The drink menu looked to be interesting and creative but the attitude of the staff (I won't get into the blah reception we received from the hostess - not even a hello?!?) will ensure that I don't break my neck to get back here.",

We ordered oysters to start, along with two cocktails. The drinks were delicious and the oysters had a great presentation. The homemade hot sauce had a distinct and delicious taste. We then each had an entree. My girlfriend got the steak ale pot pie. The steak was tender and juicy and the crust was cooked to perfection. I had the lamb shank. I love big portions and this was the epitome of that. Unlike other downtown restaurants (cough Butcher cough) I was extremely satisfied with the portion sizes. The lamb was tender and juicy and falling off the bone. It was cooked to perfection!  Finally, the service was EXCEPTIONAL! Katie was our waitress and she was as friendly and polite as can be. Now it may be because they had just opened and want to make a name for themselves, but we received a free entree (crab mac n cheese), two glasses of champagne and two desserts . However, even without those freebies, I would have been stuffed. I am still in a food coma! I loved this restaurant. The food. The service. The ambience. The drinks. Even the bathrooms were clean and tidy! I will definitely be back!  Great work, The Commoner!",

I think it was the sprinkle of sesame seeds or some other small crunch element that won my vote - smooth and silky squash with the right amount of texture from the mystery \"seed!\"  Federalist Zin - yum; and the Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc/Viognier looked like a light honey but was nice and dry.  On my way out, I grabbed an Americano from their coffee bar - the barista suggested that I try a pressed Cardamon seed in the coffee.

That being said, everything we had was pretty good. Not mind blowing but pretty good. I had quiche($14), she had a pancake ($4 for 1 !) and bacon ($6).  Needless to say for those prices i expect it to be wow! Bottom line. Good food good service. But not what I expect for those prices, especially with such a limited selection. Typically with a small menu you get perfection with each item.   Not recommended. We will not go back.",

This place is certainly not cheap and you're definitely paying for location and atmosphere, but you won't be mad about it! We started off with the Not-So-Old Fashioned and the Turducken cocktails and both were really well-made. The $14 price tag was a little steep but I am glad I tried something off their bar menu. We shared a scotch egg and it was perfectly done. The curry it's served on was one of our favorite parts of the entire meal. For dinner, I had the porcini-dusted scallops and my husband the steak. Neither disappointed. Everything was cooked perfectly and the presentation was beautiful. Our server was so friendly and attentive, and the space itself is really awesome. We'll be back for sure!",

We went with the crab dip for an appetizer and we each got a burger. Everything was very good, but it took a long time. The place was relatively empty, but it took over 45 minutes for burgers. It was odd. Other than that, all was well. I think if the place got really busy, it could get pretty noisy, but I can't say for sure since it was in the middle of the afternoon.",

I definitely felt industrial/old train station meets new train station vibes when I stepped foot in this place. They can really fit a lot of people down here which is key since they are a part of Hotel Monaco. I do still recommend making reservations; my friends and I failed to do that and found ourselves having brunch at the bar.   When I go out for brunch I try to stray away from the basic eggs/bacon type of dishes. Needless to say, the Pierogi & Eggs was calling my name. The Pierogi's were fried a little too much for my liking, but the poached egg helped soften them up a bit. Speaking of poached egg they didn't mention that was the type of egg it came with on the menu. I would have asked for a different type of egg if I knew this. At the end of the day I think it went well with the dish. Also, the menu says it comes with a loaded baked potato which is what I was picturing. To my surprise they were actually just roasted potatoes. I did really enjoy the dish; I just have pet peeves when it comes to what the menu says and what you actually get.   I would recommend this spot for brunch, especially if you are a bloody mary drinker - they have a pretty impressive bloody mary bar.",

    "text": "Looking at other's reviews... I'm wondering if we had a bad experience or if everyone else is just crazy. Either way, I was let down by the Commoner. I came here once for drinks in between a wedding ceremony last Summer & decided on checking out the brunch here last weekend.  The Commoner is located inside of Hotel Monaco in downtown Pittsburgh, so it is obviously adorable. I really do love the atmosphere here and I thought it was a great place to get drinks. We had a group of 6 for reservations for brunch at around 1:00. When we arrived, there were only about 2-3 other tables full and a handful of people sitting at the bar. I was surprised that it was not more crowded! Our waitress was just OK- not super friendly and didn't seem to care about any small talk with us. She also was insistent on everyone ordering the $12 bellini's that we basically finished in 2 sips.   We all started with the Bellini's and then ordered drinks of our choice after. The menu was pretty big, so it took us awhile to decide what we were in the mood for. Some decided on the hamburger, omelets,  crab benedict & chicken & biscuits. I went with the burger because I was starving- and it was nothing special at all... I don't even think I finished it.  Nobody else raved about what they ordered and we all agreed that it was just OK. For as much as our tabs were for a couple drinks and a mediocre meal, I wish that it was a little bit more of a stand-out brunch. Probably won't be back here to eat- I could see stopping back for drinks when I'm downtown.",

However, the quality of the food was variable. The roasted cauliflower appetizer was delicious. The chicken wings had a nice texture, but seasonings did not play well with each other. The burgers (regular and lamb) were tasty, but the fries had a dry mealy texture. The tikka masala had an excellent flavor, but was mainly sauce with only rare chunks of vegetables. The $10 upcharge to add protein seemed excessive for a $20 vegetable puree. The hotel unfortunately allows people to smoke immediately outside the rotating front doors, and this may it very unpleasant to walk through.",

We sat at the bar and had some drinks for about 2 hours.  drinks were excellent and the service was very good from the bartenders.  We did not eat, but the restaurant was packed and people waiting.    Bartender said they have really good breakfast there, but we didn't get a chance to enjoy it.  Would be back for drinks though, plus it was in walking distance from our hotel.   Great place to come and relax in a very nice restaurant/bar atmosphere.",

    "text": "Given my collective experiences now at The Commoner, I don't think I need to return again.  This last time included a very salty hostess who actually led us to the decision to leave before we were seated.  The short version of that story is:  -We arrived on time for our reservation and were told the table was being cleaned off, after the hostess snapped at my guest for standing on the wrong side of the podium. -We waited and waited, during which time a pair without a reservation came in and were seated right away. -After waiting some more, the hostess told us that \"The table over there says their table is too cold. You want that table?\" I asked if it would be okay if we continued to wait for the table they were \"clearing off\" only to be told that the diners at that table had yet to leave. -Finally, we left. Sidenote: the reservation was declared a no-show on OpenTable though I'd already received confirmation that we had checked in.  Not cool, hostess - not cool.   The Commoner is fine if you want a drink, but as far as the unimpressive food and bad attitude go, I'm over it.",

    "text": "We have stayed at the Kimpton several times and have paid The Commoner at least one visit each time. And every time, we have a terrific time.   Last night, when we checked in at the last minute (because SNOW and no, I'm not going to drive in that, thank you very much), we had dinner at the height of their rush.   Though the restaurant was busy and bustling with people, the staff were just as genial and helpful as ever (which is a good thing). We got drinks--a Grenache blend for me and rosemary lemonade for the kids--and enjoyed a bit of conversation. And then, THE FOOD.  We started with blue crab fritters that came with a sweet & spicy dipping sauce. RUN, do not walk to these. We could have ordered these 4x over and finished every morsel. YUM.  Dinners were: The Commoner Burger for The Boy (his favorite) with duck fat fries; seared scallops with risotto for The Girl (her plate was clean, bearing no evidence there'd ever been good on it at all, in the blink of an eye), and the herb-crusted ribeye with duck fat potato wedges for me. My steak was AH-mazing. Cooked perfectly, it was just what the doctor ordered on a polar cold night. The potatoes were a bit underdone, but meh. If that's the worst I can come up with? Not a big deal.  Desserts were (and we shared) sticky toffee pudding, dark chocolate souffle cake, and this pistachio-chocolate mousse thing with honey tuile cookies ... It all tasted like sin. Delicious, delicious SIN.  More than the food at The Commoner (which we love), we love the people who work there. Every experience has been wonderful and they always go out of their way to make things special. And now? We're headed down there for breakfast. :)",

It blends the feel of an upscale eatery with the look of a dark, intimate basement, while still having plenty of space.   I've been there twice in the last month. The first time I had the pork Mac and cheese, with a scotch egg for an appetizer, and the infamous sticky toffee pudding as a dessert. The scotch egg was delicious. The egg was cooked perfectly and the sauce that came with it had just the right amount of kick. My entree, although it was delicious, Came out Luke warm at best. The dish itself was delicious, though! The dessert lived up to the hype, as well. There's no wonder that it's been on the menu since the birth of the restaurant.   I went again last night and had the black market - it was a wagyu flank steak with potatoes and carrots (a Demi glaze as well, but I can't remember the specifics of it). Unfortunately, my dish was Luke warm again. Also, per the waiters suggestion, I ordered it rare expecting it to be tender - it ended up being extremely chewy and difficult to eat. The others I was with also ordered it, and had similar things to say. The flavors of the dish itself were great, though!  I want to like the Commoner. I really do. But I've had subpar experiences both times leading to the below average review.",

He helped us pick out fantastic appetizers (scotch egg and corn crab fritters ). We also split the fried chicken sandwich and substituted cauliflower instead of French fries.  All the food was phenomenal. Alex also offered us many suggestions for places to check out in the city and he even answered my email answering more questions we had! Overall, a fantastic experience.

We chose the cheese plate as our appetizer, which was wonderful. Raisin jam, moody blue cheese, and pistachios galore! We then split the pork belly mac & cheese and the Brussels and bacon. Everything was fabulous.  In addition, our service was excellent. Our waiter was exceptionally personable and was always extremely attentive regardless of how busy he was.

We ordered a flatbread - which was great. Also we ordered the brussel sprouts which were amazing! It seemed reasonably priced for the upscale atmosphere.

There were bits with some crunch and chew intermixed with bits of smooth cakey toffee goodness.

What else do you need :)  We started off with the Sausage Deviled Eggs appetizer. It was tasty and something new for us. Since we weren't too hungry we decided to split an entree and a desert later. We decided in the Steak and Ale Pie. The meat is just perfect and deliciously juicy with a nice and crisp crust. Our waiter helped us out so much with drinks - and got us some good virgin mojitos. The recommendation to go with the Sticky Toffee Pudding was great. It was gooey sweet and the highlight of the meal. Finally our waiter actually gave us a few more tips which places to check out later once he heard we were new in town. If that's not customer service, what is ;) This place is a must try!",

The crab and corn fritters had a decent taste, but the texture was a bit interesting with the crab. Our favorite appetizer order was definitely the broccoli toast!   I ordered the Commoner salad, which had a wonderful vinaigrette dressing and a nice mix in the texture of the ingredients. My partner ordered the Commoner burger, which he seemed to enjoy and came with a side of fries. The onion jam that came with the burger was especially delicious.",

We each ordered something different and all 5 of is enjoyed our meals. I tasted the crab soup which had the consistency and flavor like a bisque.

We made our reservations 2 days in advance, and they were for a little later in the evening, around 8:30.  The night of, we ended up having to push our reservation back twice, because well, life happens and you can't control the world around you, and it was just one unforeseen circumstance after another.. which was slowly making our night stressful and pretty miserable.  But both times I shamefully called to change our dinner time, they were so overly nice and accommodating, and that alone made my night better, and took away some of the tension that we were experiencing trying to get there.    When we FINALLY arrived, we were greeted by warm, smiling faces and a personalized welcome that was much appreciated.  We were taken right away to our table, and to our surprise, there was a framed picture of my husband and I from our wedding day, and written on the picture said \"Happy Anniversary From Hotel Monaco Pittsburgh\", along with a personalize card, a bottle of champagne and desert for both of us.. are you kidding me?  We were so blown away by the time and effort that was taken to help us celebrate our anniversary.. it was unbelievable.   We were greeted by our server who promptly wished us a Happy Anniversary and poured our champagne, and from there, the service we were given was outstanding.  From our server, to the food and drinks, to the staff helping to run food and clear tables, everyone was absolutely incredible.  Even without all of the personalized touches, we would have been very happy and impressed with our experience at The Commoner, but when you go so above and beyond to make your guests feel important and welcome, that's an amazing business.    I work for another luxury hotel downtown, and we do these kinds of things for people all of the time, so it was so nice to be on the receiving end and remember just how important these kinds of gestures are.  This was our first time even stepping inside of the Hotel Monaco, but I can assure you that we absolutely will be back, whether its for dinner or for a short stay.    Thank you to the staff for making our 2nd anniversary so memorable!",

My wife and I went for breakfast. I ordered the pancakes and eggs Benedict. I was sadly disappointed in the pancakes. The were extremely salty. Almost like they were cooked in bacon grease. I didn't even finish them. The eggs Benedict were ok if you did not eat the biscuits. They were really sour and not good. My wife got the Omelet. It was good but it was not really an omelet. It's was ham and cheese between two egg type patties. My wife wanted an omelet so she was a little disappointed. The potatoes that came with breakfast were delicious as well as the BloodyMary.  Our service wasn't that good either. Overall our experience was very disappointing.",

First of all, the service was excellent and very polite, even the manager was going around to each table greeting the customers. In addition, the restaurant itself is gorgeous and has almost a rustic and edgy feel to it. The food and drinks were great. They have a massive drink list plus several good drafts that you might not normally find at a regular restaurant. I had the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA which is not as commonly served as the 60 Minute per se. I ordered the Chicken Liver Ravioli which, while a little on the dry side, was light and very flavorful. For dessert, I split the Chocolate Souffle with another person and I'm glad I did! The souffle was very rich and decadent.  I had a wonderful experience at the Commoner and I recommend making a visit if you're downtown!",

I'm currently pregnant so we skipped the drinks and the appetizers because momma wanted dessert :). I ordered the ribeye special and it came with mashed potatoes, carrots, and a huge delicious steak!! Hubby got the burger all the way. My steak was amazing!!  The sides were scrumptious! Sadly my steak was half under done, but the manager came over, apologized, made me a new one, and comped our dessert! Best customer service!! Hubby loved his burger and ate every bite! We finished our meal and ordered the brownie and the cake I can't recall. It was either fig or date cake with ice cream on top. The cake was mind blowing!! I wish we had ordered two and then my husband may have gotten to eat more of it :p The brownie I got was ok, it was just a cold brownie with a whimsical edible egg on top that they crack for you. The egg was filled with a sour fruit flavor that I didn't enjoy and didn't really go with the brownie. Warm that brownie up, top it with some ice cream, make the egg full of chocolate and you would have a winner! Over all an amazing meal with even better service. We will be stopping in again next time we come thru.",

We immediately grabbed our things, told the staff what had happened, and to our amazement, the staff seemed legitimately unfazed?!! DO NOT GO HERE, the look had to be a facade!!! For them to be so nonchalant about something that disgusting must mean they don't keep the place very clean, at all!!!",

    "text": "Meh.  We stayed at Fairmont and walked out of our way to try The Commoner but was disappointed. We should've just eaten at our hotel restaurant.  I wouldn't have noticed this place if we weren't actually looking for it, my parents didn't even see it. The interior is gorgeous though! I was just expecting my meal to be fabulous to match the fabulous interior but it was rather unfabulous.   We asked for a table for 3 and the hostess said they had no seats available.. but 2/3 of the restaurant was empty.. and I'm not exaggerating. They said they were all reserved so we understood and we got a counter seat, which was actually very depressing. (Throughout our whole meal and when we were leaving the restaurant was still 2/3 empty.)   As for the food, I got the eggs benedict, which was meh. Both eggs were overcooked, one more than the other. One of the main factors of an eggs benedict is the poached egg! Having that yolk pour out as you cut your egg in half, but this benedict had nothing pour out. The bread was also hard and dry. My mom got \"the mess\" and she said it was alright, it was dry. My dad also got \"the mess\" but requested it substituted with only vegetarian options. There are also supposed to be poached eggs but his were overcooked.  Would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "After a wonderful 2 nights at the Hotel Monaco, the GF and I had reservations for brunch at the in-house Commoner before flying back to Philly. The beautifully designed gastropub is a homage to the Steel City's industrial history, with steel beams and gold highlights throughout. It's not your typical \"hotel restaurant,\" to be sure, as it's on par, if not exceeds other Kimpton property restaurants I've visited (think: Red Owl Tavern and Square 1682).   Bringing more than 20 years of experience, Executive Chef Dennis Marron was brought in last year from D.C.'s Poste Modern Brasserie. It's clear from the dishes we tried, execution and quality are important to Chef Marron. But what sold us? The Bloody Mary bar we kept hearing about!    Bloody Mary [$12] Bacon-infused vodka  If a restaurant has its own Bloody Mary bar, there's no reason to get the standard Bloody. What does the Commoner's entail? A huge lineup for everything you need. First, you pick the type of vodka you want. The GF went with the celery-infused vodka, which had great herbaceous notes. I went with the smoky bacon-infused iteration, obviously. After you server brings the alcohol, you take a trip to the bar.    For toppers and mixers, they've got every hot sauce you've dreamed of including meats, cheeses, pickled everything, infused tomato juices, bacon, and yes, grilled cheese. I had more than just a little fun with my creation.   Pierogi & Eggs [$12] Sour cream hollandaise, grilled scallions   For the meal proper, the GF went with the pierogi and eggs, much to my delight. While the poached egg was slightly over, the sour cream hollandaise was the perfect rich and tangy balance to the starch of the creamy, well-seasoned pierogis. The dumplings were spot on and had a crisp outer shell. The grilled scallions imparted some bite and the home fries were great - well seasoned, slightly crisp, yet creamy within, with roasted red peppers and onions studded throughout.   Bacon Beni [$13] Crispy house-cured bacon, pork belly, house-made English muffin, onion soubise  I went with the bacon beni which was one of my favorite dishes of the weekend. Amazingly crisp bacon sat atop of gorgeously braised, then crisped thick-cut pork belly. The housemade muffin maintained its toasted texture with a perfectly poached egg on top. The onion soubise was the right sauce to provide some bright acidic counterbalance to each bite. A must order in my mind.  Roots & Tubers [$7] Roasted baby carrots, beets, sunchokes, parsnips, celery root puree  We had plenty of starch with our mains, but when I saw the roots and tubers go out to another table, I knew I had to order this as well. A gorgeous plate of carrots, beets, sunchokes, and parsnips came atop a roasted celery root puree. The innate sweetness came out from this beautiful melange of perfectly roasted and lightly seasoned veg.  Sticky Toffee Puddings [$8] Steamed date cake, toffee sauce, rye vanilla ice cream  And with this, the kitchen sent out some sticky toffee pudding. And despite being full, we finished this with no problem - it was that good. We were sold from the house-made ice cream which was clearly not just vanilla. It had a surprisingly light bite from the whiskey, which really complemented the richness of the perfectly made cake, with the macerated portions with toffee really standing out. Rich, bitter, sweet, salty - it was all there.  So if you're in Pittsburgh, there's no reason why you shouldn't stop by the Commoner for a meal or a drink. And if you're staying at the Hotel Monaco? It should be part of your itinerary. Well-executed, and thoughtfully delicious dishes with quality ingredients await.",

Second visit I ordered the scotch egg (with a spicy creole sauce) - it was very flavorful, although the poached eggs were a bit too runny for me. Dessert of S'mores Cake was a bit disappointing, but it was probably just that time - the cinnamon graham cracker on top seemed hard and stale, and the cake below was a tad dry as well. The marshmallow fluff was burnt and gooey to the point of being hard to scoop. The dark chocolate and caramelized bananas were great. HOWEVER, I generally like sweets anyway, so despite it actually being too sweet for me halfway through the enormous portion, I was happy to eat it.  And the upside to this place is the wonderful service - unfortunately I don't recall the name of the lady who waited on me the first time, but she was warm and friendly (and really quite chatty, which I liked!). The server during my second visit, Art, also had a personable warmth. And the moment I asked him about the state of my cookie, he immediately comped the dessert. Since the food is above average and the service even more so, I will be back several times to try the rest of the menu.",

The drink menu is very interesting because it doesn't tell you every ingredient. It gives you drink names and flavor profiles (herbal, spicy, fruity) and you choose from that. It led me to pick more interesting drinks than I would have in a typical menu, which made the experience better!   We had dinner reservations or I easily could have stayed all night!

The decor of the restaurant was modern and industrial feel. We had 4 people in our party.  The food was good, nothing to get overly excited about.  Meals:  Omelet- decent sized and flavorful.  Commoner burger- great proportion and great tasting  Crab Benedict - was solid   pancakes and side bacon-  had to order child's menu pancakes because they were not on the regular menu. side of bacon was $6 dollars .. pancakes tasted homemade and was sized for a adult serving.   The 3 star rating is all because of the waiter. The service was not great at all. We waited 25 mins to get our drinks. (wish I was exaggerating) I had to walk up to the server who was standing around talking in the corner to see if he forgot about us. When he did come back over with our drinks he did give me a free cocktail because of the wait. The waiter never informed us about the specials. He never stopped to see if our orders came out okay or if we needed anything. Someone in the party had to get his attention while he was walking past our table.   Over all I would go back again and hopefully not get that server again. The food was a solid choice, but it would not be my first pick for brunch.",

To start, the reservations were right on time, the bar is really long and large so, seating there was fine while we waited for our table - we arrived a bit earlier than our reservation time and had a drink at the bar. The cocktail called Sex on the Mon Warf was amazing. Wonderfully tastey and just perfect. I had 3 of them before we left! Food was delicious, scallops perfectly prepared and steak also perfect and just as requested. Birthday fig cake with ice cream on top was a sweet touch - very flavorful and not too sweet. Staff accommodated special attention for bday dinner without making too much of a fuss. No singing - a cool sign placed at table when we were seated. Overall amazing experience, we were impressed with how on point the staff were in just about every role. Can't wait to go back!",

After hearing the daily specials, I had my heart set on the quiche, however it was not going to be ready for another 30-45 minutes. I ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, as I was in the mood for something sweet and savory. The chicken was cooked perfectly - crisp and juicy. The waffle was so light, fluffy and packed full of flavor and the cherry compote paired perfectly with the salty, crisp chicken breast. I would definitely come back to try the various other menu items that piqued my interest. Tip for others thinking about trying The Commoner for brunch - If you arrive before 10 am, the quiche may not be ready so have a backup plan when it comes time to order!",

It was over an hour wait for a table but about 20 minutes for a seat at the chef's table (that is like sitting side by side at a diner - but way nicer). We started with drinks which were excellent. I ordered the tikka masala which was good but the standout was the elk special my husband ordered. Perfectly prepared with a really great flavor, meaty like steak and not gamey at all. And the portion size was very generous. The chef making flatbreads and meats in their wood burning oven was friendly and even prepared a special little dessert for us using red grapes he was roasting. Since we aren't from the area he also made some recommendations for other craft cocktail bars and restaurants.   Overall The Commoner has a very nice atmosphere, attentive service (without being annoying) and great food. I highly recommend but expect a wait.",

We got there at 7 and ordered drinks immediately. Now, granted, the drinks are art in itself BUT it took FOREVER to get them. We almost started ordering 2 at a time just so we didn't go thirsty.   We ordered off a limited menu, which they told us it would relieve kitchen a bit and speed up the process. I'd hate to see how long it would've taken if we didn't do that. Our full mea took 3.5 hours! And we only had 3 drinks within that time period because it took so long to get them.   Beyond the wait, the salad was good, especially the blue cheese crumbles. I had the double bone in pork chop, medium, and it was pretty good. Served with roasted potatoes and greens.   Then to dessert, we sampled everything we could (which was only 3 options). The PB&j dessert was fantastic with a peanut butter mousse.   Overall, it was a very cool atmosphere but the service was sooooo slow. Definitely lost the buzz I had going in there. I'd be willing to try them again but in a smaller group.",

    "text": "The Commoner was the destination of Christmas 2017 Sibling Date Night as my husband's brother, sister, and their spouses were in town for the holidays. Usually, we would never take visiting friends and family to a restaurant that we'd not tried, but we had to take the risk. We needed (1) a Saturday night dinner reservation only planned out a week or two in advance, (2) table for six, (3) an 8pm reservation -- not too late that we were exhausted and not too early that all five children staying with grandma and grandpa couldn't be put down to bed before we left home, and (4) a restaurant that would serve both conservative and adventurous tastes. The Commoner was the only restaurant that delivered on all four, so there we went.  The restaurant is more spacious than I anticipated, with a very cool industrial vibe. It's a very wide restaurant with lots of dark wood and leather furniture and an exposed black painted ceiling. I immediately felt that my cool-factor went up about 10 points after walking in, and I began to make sure that I was wearing an acceptable outfit for this date night.  As each appetizer and entree was brought to the table, I continued to hold my breath, hoping that everyone would enjoy their meal at this restaurant that I had had no chance to personally vet. We started with the Flatbread, Crispy Cauliflower, and Beef Tartare. All three appetizers were delightful, with some of us liking one over another. However, I believe that the table favorite was the Flatbread. The combination of salty, sweet, and creamy - the salty flatbread with a sweet date puree and creamy sheep's milk feta - was out of this world delicious.  As the food continued to make its way to our table, I drank several Drink Gin, Eat Yoghurt cocktails. My rule is that if I see Wigle Ginever on a cocktail menu, I order whatever it is. Well, this was not just Wigle Ginever but lemon balm infused Wigle Organic Ginever, so I was all in! The cocktail was a creamy and smooth (from the actual yogurt) not too sour and not too sweet concoction that I'd love to drink again.  Then, dinner arrived. Yummmmmmmm. We all ordered something different, basically the entire Cuts portion of the menu, which was fun to try each other's meals. Everything that I had was delicious! I personally ordered the Double Bone-In Pork Chop. My meat must have been nearly 3\" thick and was cooked to beautiful medium rare perfection. The sides of potatoes, pumpkin puree and apples paired beautifully with the pork. The flavor combination felt like a giant fall hug. Yes, like I was being hugged by the fall season, cozy sweaters and fall festivals and pumpkin patches and all. Not really any other way that I can describe it.  In hindsight, we should have stayed for dessert, but instead made our way to the Wigle Whiskey Tasting Room for after dinner drinks. Can't wait for my next time at The Commoner!",

    "text": "It's pretty good.  I need to conduct more research...  So it's a very nice space to be in.  It's very cool, very hip, to be in a converted, semi-subterranean space, with big, exposed steel columns.  The lighting is cool - lots of stained glass fixtures, as you can see from the many photos.  So the food:  It was good, but a bit pricey, like they want to be more upscale.  Example:  Their basic entree salad, add grilled chicken, is $18.  Still, it's a very good salad, with fresh goat cheese and some interesting greens and veggies.  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, and it was quite good.  It features an unusual blend of cheese (white in color; I'm sure the menus specified what it was), on large, Texas-toast style bread.  It was grilled perfectly, so the bread had a crisp outer bit, but was still soft inside.  Service was okay, a bit slow, and surprisingly, the server said he knew nothing of their desert offerings.    Still, I'd like to try again.  I'll order something else (the menu is interesting) and will update my review if necessary.",

    "text": "I love the Commoner more for their ambience than the food. The food is delicious but nothing beats the atmosphere and decor.  The restaurant is on the ground floor of Hotel Monaco and street parking is available along with Valet parking and a garage parking nearby. When done with dinner, do take advantage of the Hotel's artfully decorated lobby and explore a bit. You will find many opportunities to take beautiful instagrammable pictures.  I had come to the restaurant earlier for just refreshments but this time we came for dinner and highly enjoyed ourselves. We got a really nice server who was more than happy to accomodate our requests and give us helpful feedback about the various food items. We started with the duck drummetes which were recommended by our server and we definetly did not regret the decision. I was craving asian fusion and this appetizer really fulfilled that craving because it was spicy and had a peanut sauce glaze along with black sesames on it. Next, I got the charred salmon entree and my friend got the new york strip (medium rare). We both loved our entree although i was full really quickly and had to take half of the entree to go.  The salmon was very nicely cooked and also very filling. It had farro in the bottom and a zucchini patty as well. My friend's New york strip was quite big and filling and my friend also took half of his entree to go. The meat had a blue cheese glaze and potatoes accompanied with it.  We ended our meal with the dessert, robin's nest. It was a brownie in the bottom, chocolate strings and a sweet egg which was filled with passion fruit liquid which oozed over like an egg when broken into. The playful dessert was quite fun but left much to be desired. The brownie was fudgy but next time i want to try the more popular toffee pudding.",

    "text": "I just ate at the Commoner tonight for a work dinner and I truly enjoyed myself. The Commoner has a unique feel to it. It almost feels like a classy speakeasy. I almost felt like I was in NYC, I loved it. It's a dim atmosphere and the decor is really unique. I especially loved the plates they use for appetizers and desserts - intricate and cute.   The service here was awesome. The waiter was attentive and extremely polite. He started with the women first and then the men to take orders. The water is left on the table and he poured it for us when our cups were low. He always cleared our plates when needed and took our drink orders as our cocktails were finished. No long waits!   The food was great! Our table ordered the fried cauliflower, which was spicy and hearty, very tasty. We also had the beef tartar, I'm not a huge fan, I like tuna tartar better but this was good! Lastly for appetizers, we had the roasted root vegetables and those were cooked perfectly, with an array of root veggies to choose from.   I ended up ordering the ribeye that had a baked potatoes underneath with pearl onions, mushrooms and fois gras butter. What a lovely dish. Extremely filling, cooked the way I like (med rare) and tasted great! I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. Mostly all of the dishes my coworkers had were great portions except the scallops but that kind of dish is usually a lighter fare anywhere you go. Everyone at the table said their meals were delicious and they looked to be.  We also ordered dessert. A few of us split the caramel apple cake dish and the bee pollen dish.. I actually forget what it was called but it was EXCELLENT! I would order that dish alone, I loved it. Just sweet and creamy enough. The apple cake was okay but I'm not a huge fan of desserts like that.   Lastly, the cocktails were SUPER unique and all homemade. I got the \"What's The Capital of Thailand\" and it was good! Not too sweet or bitter, with rum, coconut milk, orange bitters and other ingredients. I enjoyed it. The cocktail and drink menu has something for everyone.   I'd love to go back here again!",

I brought a cake and was not informed when I made the reservation nor when when I handed the waitress the cake to cut that there would be a cake charge per plate. The charge appeared on my bill for $32 pretty close to the cost of the cake. I spoke to the waitress and the manager. They said that was the policy. I brought with me to the bar a cake knife, plates, and forks if I knew you would charge that I would have cut it myself. They would no reduce or remove the charge even though three staff did not share this information.  Will not return.",

They gave us a seat at the big communal tables which was perfectly fine.   Waitress was nice and did well at the front end but then Disappeared later in the service. Took a bit to get the check.   Aside from the above, overall experience was a 4.5 stars. First off the Bloody Mary bar is like nothing I've seen. So many options. Different mixes, olives, pickles, pickled veggies, bacon, focaccia bread, etc. I really enjoyed my bloody.   Then we ordered the French toast. Amazing!  It's like a cinnamon roll with an egg nog batter. Holy good!  Very rich. One order feeds two. Taste explosion.   Wifey had the crab Benedict. Also amazing. The has that accompanies it is fresh and well designed. Meal was awesome and the place was really happening. Def coming back for the brunch.",

There are great windows to see the street foot traffic. As I walked in it appeared there was an after work crowd, dressed up, eating, drinking and having fun.   I ate at the bar and had a few craft beers on draft. The 5-7 beers on draft were a nice selection of local and afar from a number of styles (Kolsch, Pilsner, IPA, Porter, Lager, etc.)  The menu also looked fabulous. I'm a vegetarian so I stayed away from a lot of the stuff other readers would love. I planned to have the roasted cauliflower and then a Cobb Salad. In fact, I was full after just the cauliflower. It was really amazing. It came in it's own cast iron skillet. There was just the right amount of char. It was really filling. There's a bacon jam or something. I ate a bit of it. I got it on the side. It reminded me more of German red cabbage.    In short, it's a great place. Great food, great drinks, great ambiance.",

Upon staying at the Hotel Monaco for the weekend, we decided that it was so convenient, this would be a great place to meet my mom and stepdad for lunch. Bad idea number one.  Despite having a reservation, we still waited a bit.  Service was also awful.  Apparently, we expected too much by wanting our server to actually have a personality and not act put out by having to wait on us.  The food was underwhelming (I had the lenten Fish and Chip special). Tiny portion of fish even.  Just not a good experience and for 98.00 for lunch- not really worth it.  I assumed this couldn't be the norm here given how much people in Pgh seem to love it... So we went back late night Friday.  No hostess - and when I asked the bartender if I could still get a table, I was greeted with a rude laugh. Apparently the hostess was gone and didn't tell anyone?  Another big strike but we were meeting friends so we figured this was easiest. Service was mediocre at best.  Drinks were okay, and I ended up going back to wine because it was more consistent.  The mussels were good and the pretzel.  We can call these the high points.    I can go on more but I figure I have spent enough time rehashing a bad experience or two...   Like I said... Just not impressed.  We were captive because we didn't have a car and ended up here more than we would have liked because of it.   That said, even though I will likely return to the Hotel Monaco, I will not be returning here to this place.  There are other better places downtown to explore... So go do so.",

One of our party accidentally spilled their drink and all of us got up to help but no assistance from the staff. We had to finally ask someone if they could help us which they did grudgingly. Our server (Pat) was nowhere to be seen and didn't even come by to ask  if we needed a refill of the spilled drink, our coffees or if our food was ok. At the end of the meal he came to ask us if we wanted to order anything else with a bill in hand! Clearly pat was in a rush to get us out! I would have been less incensed if that was the norm across the board but Pat was very attentive to the large party next to us....probably because gratuity was already included!  My advice to Pat and the Commoner in general is that this is a service based industry and a city that is teaming with really good restaurants. If you want to stay competitive, learn to please your customers.  Terrible experience.  They ruined my Mother's Day!",

    "text": "My husband and I enjoyed a Sunday night in Pittsburg. Our main goal to try one of the top 20 restaurants in the city. My husband chose the Commoner. Tucked away on a street in Downtown this gastro pub did not disappoint.   Drinks: I ordered a dirty martini and my husband had his typical Manhattan with Bullet bourbon. Sips were complete and drinks were perfect.   Starters: butter lettuce salad (minus the cheese) and the scotch egg (which my husband said was the best he'd had. Both were delightful.    Dinner: I had the fish and chips which was super yummy. It mentioned that it came with smashed peas which I was super excited about. When the fish came (no peas). Our server said they were out of peas so he mentioned he would make up for it with a special dessert. My husband had the Commoner Burger which he said was really juicy and fries were perfect.   Dessert: since I have a dairy allergy our server brought us  this amazing pomegranate ice. Best ever. Totally cleaned the pallet.   Service: we made reservations on open table and had a great booth. Our server was funny, knew the menu well and when I asked for the kitchen favorites he was happy to tell us what most people ordered. Of course I had the fish n chips in mind but he mentioned how popular the shepherds pie was. I give him 5 stars for great service.",

Someone else in our party had the Commoner salad, which was much larger and about the same price. Curious. Beers are always good here, with a variety of pale ales and ipas.   A half level underground with an industrial decor, very nice with great lighting. Great place for groups at the high tables and tall cafeteria style long tables. Acoustics are too lively; you end up leaning over and yelling to the person across the table when it gets full.   Its becoming our go-to when we're in town; although it's not cheap and I keep thinking you can get the same for less Philly. Location is right downtown and close to the hotels, which could explain the price.",

It was great they served mac n cheese in the morning for my picky kids, but they still didn't eat it. My one daughter got a kids pancake, which was about the size of a pan and they were all able to share that. My husband had the steak and eggs, he said they were good. Their orange juice was so good, as was their coffee. The manager even came to ask us how we were doing.",

He had been there for lunch a few times while working nearby, so I was excited to try it for dinner.  The atmosphere is part hipster, part old-school, part upscale, and totally works.  The drink menu is excellent-- creative and varied without being absurd, and with a huge variety.  I'm a sucker for anything with bubbles, and the orange pomegranate champagne cocktail definitely delivered.  I'm not a fan of tonic, but apparently the G&T with house-made tonic is great.  The beer and wine options were very good as well.  Our server was very helpful and pleasant, and had great suggestions for both drinks and food.  We definitely over-ordered food-wise, but it was worth it to try a lot of things.  We had: --beef jerky: I typically don't even like beef jerky, but this was really, really good.   --Scotch egg: I skipped this one, but my husband said it was delicious. --roasted squash soup: one of the best soups I've had in a long time-- just the right amount of sweetness and a good mix of spice as well. --steak frites: I tried a bite, and this was great.  Grilled perfectly to medium rare, and the fries were super crispy. --shepherd's pie: simple, but delicious.  The gravy was rich and flavorful, and per usual in Pittsburgh, the potatoes were on point. --dessert: I can't remember what my other half ordered, but the dark chocolate souffle cake was amazing.  Which means that despite being stuffed from everything else on this list, I almost finished it.  I come into Pittsburgh rarely so I really should branch out and try more places, but I'd be very happy to find myself back at the Commoner instead.",

Each time we arrived 10 minutes ahead of the reservation time, except for one where we decided to risk it and show up without a reservation (risky since it was only a month old at the time).  The host/hostesses were a little on the formal side, but not to the point of feeling stuffy/high brow.  I get easily excited about food, so maybe that's just me.  All waiter/waitresses we've had have been on point.  And on the once occasion our lady waiter seemed to be having an off day with remembering orders, she took it in stride and our service didn't really falter.  Our water glasses were kept full, and for those enjoying drinks the refills didn't take constant reminders to the wait staff, something that personally will make or break my experience.  (If I have to worry about taking the next bite of food because my drink hasn't been refilled in a while ... you're losing one star right off the bat folks, got to stay hydrated!)  And last but not least the food.  AWESOME.  I've personally had: Commoner Burger, Smoked Turkey and Bacon, Turkey Chili, Wild Mushroom Soup, and the Commoner Salad.  All of it was excellent.  The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered.  The greens on the salad were fresh and crisp.  And the candied bacon on the Turkey and Bacon sandwich was to die for.  Word of caution ... if you're not a fan of smoked meats, skip over the Turkey Bacon.  It took me a few bites to get used to that, but once I adjusted to the smokiness, it was great.",

I came by for lunch with two friends and they did a great job getting the food out quickly so we could all be back at work within the hour. I chose the grilled cheese and tomato bisque and my friends had the vegetable sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich. We all went with pretty basic menu items and we were all pleased with our meal. However, $12 is steep for a pretty basic grilled cheese and soup in my opinion. Heck -- there's not even any meat in the dish!   I considered getting the burger -- but at nearly $20 its definitely not in my \"lunch\" price range.   I've said it in a number of ways -- it's overpriced. It's trying to be something it's not with the prices. I would come back more often if it was just a bit more realistic.",

The grits that accompanied the pork belly were not cheesy and drenched in what tasted like a balsamic dressing. I ordered the chicken fried scallops and (being from the south) expected flour/egg batter, but it was pasty dough, fried. The scallops inside were perfectly cooked, but the batter not quite what I expected. The accompaniments were Texas caviar (beans), which were undercooked and creamed corn, which tasted canned. My husband ordered the pork shank. The meat was perfection, but once again, the side of beans was undercooked. The table beside us ordered an well done burger and it came out medium rare and they had to send it back to the kitchen for correction. I understand some degree of error, but not that much. I think maybe the chef was not present tonight and had amateurs in the kitchen. I have eaten at much better restaurants for the price.",

I ordered the Commoner burger with a side salad, short rib pirogies, and mac n cini.   The mac n cini was awesome, however the short rib pirogies weren't that great. It was literally just short rib in a pirogi dough and then fried. The burger was what was really disappointing. It had a sour taste to it and the beef bacon had a weird texture.

    "text": "I haven't visited the Commoner for anything other than Brunch.  However - Brunch has always been amazing.  Hands down one of the best brunches I've had.  My friend and I both, almost always, get the Beni's.  I lean towards the amazing - seriously - amazing - bacon Beni.  You can never have too much bacon!    The only frustrating experience I've had the couple times I've had brunch - they always tell us to wait at the bar till our table is ready.  Every.single.time - the table is ready upon us arriving, but they want that money spent at the bar.  To the point - one time - they forgot us.  We sat at the bar for almost 45 minutes - granted they gave us both a free Mimosa to make up for the error.    The food is amazing, the Mimosas are amazing.  I will be back.  Many. Many Times!",

    "text": "Mediocre at best.  There are so many great restaurants downtown that even for the ones I love, I have a hard time returning to because there are so many to try and so many to love!  The Commoner is not on my return list. I like the decor and ambiance, and I generally like the Hotel Monaco -- for instance, I loveeee Biergarten, and it is my favorite summer bar. Like Biergarten above, their drinks are quite nice. I had a cocktail and it was boozy and delicious.  The food was where it went wrong. I had the steak and ale pie per some suggestions, and it was thoroughly disappointing. The insides, including the steak, were overcooked, the outside was too thick and perhaps undercooked, and the whole thing was incredibly salty to the point of almost inedible. Based on other reviews, it seems like this dish has been good for some people -- maybe the Commoner suffers from inconsistency.  Whatever the case may be, Pittsburgh is bristling with great restaurants that are popping up everywhere, so onto the next one!",

We called to make arrangements of a reservation the morning beforehand since we had a fairly large party of about 14 but they said they would call back. Never did get a call back.     So we arrived today they did not have any reservation so must be a miscommunication between your staff.  They did accommodate for us we got our food and service was good.   But when we asked to get our bill split  as we have done in the past here for our group team breakfast, the waiter said that it is a new policy as of last month that parties over 8 have to be on the same bill.    It would make more sense to tell people that or have a sign that mentions that.",

    "text": "I'm not from here but our uber driver said the restaurant made some changes making it a popular choice now. That may justify some of the ratings because I definitely had a five star experience!   We started with hummus and the pieces of pita were too few for the amount of hummus. But our server brought us some more and we wiped every little bit of that hummus made to perfection! For entrees, we had the daily catch (salmon), the lamb burger, and some of the steaks and no one had a thing to complain about. Either the food was a 100% satisfactory or the cocktails were too good for anyone to be anything less than happy. The desserts were ON POINT. You MUST get the toffee pudding and if you're feeling like ice cream The Godfather is quite The Godfather. We also had some other caramely dessert that I can't remember but it wasn't my favorite anyway.   Special thanks to our server. Her name started with a L, I think it was Leah. She was patient with us taking some time to make our minds and was very attentive without it feeling intrusive. She also made some good recommendations throughout the courses.",

The menu's sophisticated description was exciting but foreshadowed high expectations and the disappointment to come. The portions were mediocre, the presentation well done but the taste was average for the price. I chose the chorizo & grits. I think they killed the pig, seasoned it, filled the casing, baked it, then cut it open to fill the dish they gave me. I'm not oversimplifying... it was cornmeal with spicy chili on top with two half cooked boiled eggs in it. 2 nicely bbq'ed pieces of bread on the side. My girlfriend had the smoked salmon and its basically a smoked salmon bagel you can find at any bagel restaurant. You pay for the atmosphere... and the name \"the commoner\" suits the food.",

    "text": "J and I came here for lunch yesterday after the Pen's parade. The entrance to the hotel was on the side street. You could either park in the city garage across the street or use their valet parking, which was $12 for us. First off, this venue is on point. Every detail in the place was gorgeous, from the staircase, to the tiles along the walls that flowed into the restroom, and the fixtures went very well with the industrial feel of that time period. Since we did not make a reservation, we were seated by the kitchen. Our waiter was so great. He was knowledgeable and made great recommendations. I had a glass of wine and the chicken sandwich. I added cheddar and subbed a salad instead of the fries. My salad came with a sherry vinaigrette which was pretty good. J ordered a coke and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. Our food was pretty good and we were able to take some home which is always a bonus. I was curious about what they offered for dessert and was pleasantly surprised at the variety options. I instantly eyed the sticky toffee pudding and I was so glad I ordered it. It was banging! J even had a taste and he agreed, which is great as he is super picky about food. Everything came to around $60, which wasn't bad considering the quality of the food. We will definitely be returning here to sample dinner.",

The cheese board makes for a perfect appetizer and I would certainly recommend it, 5 different kinds of cheddar along with Marcona almonds, apple butter, and a home made bread.    Service was excellent despite how busy it was for a Sunday night. After asking for a tonic, my waiter suggested not the run of the mill tonic from the gun but rather the home made tonic which you can get in a few different flavors. Needless to say it was fantastic and I appreciated the extra bit of service.   My girlfriend and I shred the onion soup burger and the romain salad. The burger was cooked to my liking and was quite flavorful. The salad was tasty but be aware it's served as one hunk of romain so you will need to cut it yourself, something I didn't mind doing once I tasted the croutons they accomplish the dish.   Our experience was overall a pleasant one and I wound recommend going if you're in Pittsburgh.",

Menu contained standards like pancakes and omlettes, but I had a hard time deciding between the four \"beni\" options (benedict) that caught my eyes. I've never passed up a benedict! Chose the lamb beni and it was delicious. Full of savory flavor and two perfectly poached eggs on top. Side of potatoes could have used more seasoning, but it didn't take away from the overall meal.   Servicer was helpful and attentive without crowding us. Place was moderately filled when we got there around 12:30.  Also wandered to the room above the hotel lobby and the eclectic charm was darling. Fire place, miss matched furniture and whimsical figurines. Great addition to the downtown food scene!",
