When I do make the trip to Pitt, I always stop by Bruegger's Bagels on Forbes Avenue for their bagel sandwiches and coffee, both of which are delicious.  I usually order a sesame seed bagel with lettuce, tomato, and cheddar cheese, and the food is always fresh and tasty.  The house coffee is great, as well.  It's not overpowering like Starbuck's, and it's always piping hot.  Great place to relax between classes.",

They are THE slowest...go in for a bagel, and you will leave ten minutes later...without the bagel and frustrated because they are the slowest group of individuals I have ever encountered.  Post Office slow...yes, that bad.    The workers are rude also.  You would think if it took 15 minutes to make a simple salad (which was not very good and quite small for the price), you would get a sorry for the wait, but nothing....  This Breugger's needs to go....or the management.",

Even if the line is long, I never worry because they are speedy quick. It's the kind of place that once you're in there a few times, they'll learn your name and what your order. They will chat with you and actually care about how you're day is going. It's very refreshing!   I usually come here before work to grab a breakfast sandwich. They have a good selection for breakfast and are very accommodating for special requests. I made up my own sandwich and always get it--a Rosemary & Olive Oil Bagel with egg, ham, cheddar cheese and their sun-dried tomato spread. The spread is so, so good. I could literally (figuratively) eat a gallon bucket of it. My bagel sandwich is always good. Is it the absolute best breakfast in Oakland? No, but for the convenience of it being so close to work, the price point and the fact that the staff is so great, I  will keep coming here a few times a week!",

I do stop by here pretty often, but that's mainly because it's located right on my way to class, it's pretty cheap, and I use their rewards app. When school gets busy and I don't have time to prepare breakfast at home, it's convenient. In the future, however, I might try to switch it up a bit and check out other cheap and easy places.   The bagels are good and the onion and chive cream cheese is tangy and awesome! I have noticed on a couple of occasions, however, some cross-contamination of cream cheese. I have tasted undeniable hints of salmon or bacon in a few bites of a sesame bagel with onion and chive cream cheese, which is very off-putting. The quantity of cream cheese on the bagel is also extremely inconsistent.   Some of the employees are nice, but almost everyone I have ever seen working here moves incredibly slowly and has to ask you to repeat your order multiple times. It does not seem like they have any type of system down for handling mid-morning rushes, and it can get slightly frustrating.   I probably will be coming here again, but my opinion of this place has declined since I first started coming here. Their products are quality, and if this place was more organized and if the employees were more efficient and meticulous, this place would be awesome.",

    "text": "Well, this place used to be my favorite and now they are awful. There was a change in management maybe 1-1.5 years ago and you can really tell. The staff are now a little rude, and incredibly slow. You can have one person in front of you in line and you will definitely be waiting at least 5 minutes. Today I had the worse experience here and this is probably it for me. You can get much better bagels at Redhawk even if you can't get sandwiches.  When I went in today, it was busy, and I was waiting a bit. A staff member came in from outside and jumped right in to working. He didn't go in the back to wash his hands at all. Then he proceeds to stick an entire finger in his mouth and tried to grab gloves to start my order. When I asked him if he was going to wash his hands since he had his fingers in his mouth, he just responded \"I know. That's why I'm putting on gloves\" with such an attitude.   I should not get a nasty attitude for asking someone who just had their fingers in their mouth right in front of me to wash their hands. This is completely unacceptable. I would definitely not recommend this location to anyone.  EDIT: The manager did call me about my feedback and was upset by the situation. She said she would deal with it immediately. I was asked if I wanted anything free, but turned that down. I am still unsure if I would return here but, I appreciated the phone call and that my feedback was taken seriously.",

I can't tell you how disappointing it is to unwrap your bagel and find out it's not what you wanted. Probably will not go back unless I unwrap my bagel every time before I leave- not something I want to do when in a rush.",

    "text": "The staff are always friendly and accommodating, but overall quality of service and location is inconsistent at best. The store is regularly a mess with food on the floors, over-filled trash cans, and tables that have not been wiped down - not a very pleasant environment for your lunch break. My order is wrong about 1 of every 5 visits. I am an avid customer of Breugger's in general but never know what to expect when I consider going to this location. It would be very useful for management to address these service issues.",

    "text": "I'm obsessed with Bruegger's. As a New Yorker, this is the best a girl in Pittsburgh is getting to a real bagel.   I think everyone who works at this location is so friendly. Especially with the amount of students that come through and sometimes the long lines, they always have a smile on their faces and a positive attitude. It is also clean, which is surprising with the amount of people coming through. It's the best place to sit, read a book, or study!  I have an obsession for the Chai Tea, which I find to be priced pretty well. I really can't get enough!!",

    "text": "I headed here for a quick bite before meeting up with my sister. I had like 5 minutes before my bus was due but was seriously in and out in two (phew!!)  I ordered the cinnamon raisin bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I'm seriously obsessed with honey walnut and brought it up to the worker for small talk. He kept the convo going by agreeing with me and saying he loves it on sweet bagels. Sometimes food workers eply with a one word phrase so it was nice customer service to chat with me.  So super fast and friendly service as well as a tasty bagel. I forgot to order it toasted but that was my fault.  Also I literally LOVE their blue apple salad.. Chicken, green apple slices, blue cheese & nuts on a bed of lettuce with champagne dressing. I have no idea what champagne dressing is, but it's fabbb!!",

    "text": "Decent Bruegger's located near the Pitt campus on Forbes. As such, it tends to be pretty busy during most parts of the day & a little less clean than most locations. They do have your standard sets of bagels, sandwiches, cream cheese, and stuff that you can take to go or eat in, assuming you have the time to sit in & do so (most do not). A suitable option for breakfast and lunch. I would go somewhere else for dinner though since I don't think this place is open during the hours that most would eat dinner at.",

It is slow sometimes but is understandable considering she has been the only one in there a lot of the time.  Glad to see she is finally getting in and training new staff to get things back on par.  Love this place and the people, aside from a few one offs this place is awesome, her staff is great and Christian always has a great attitude, awesome addition to the crew.  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Avoid this place like the plague. Never have I ever walked a more consistently inconsistent Brueggers than this one.   Today when I came in, it was the cashier who initially took my order, then handed it off to one of the workers on the line. This is where my order may have gotten lost. Since everything gets rung up at the end, there is no real system keeping track of what was ordered (including any modifications and allergies), making it easy to mess things up. The toasted asiago bagel with onion and chive cream cheese I ordered then became an untoasted cinnamon bagel with onion and chive. Ultimately I had to toss my entire bagel since I was already at my destination and could not get it remade.  The real issue here is the lack of a proper ordering system and a reliance on verbal communication between workers. If I had any real allergies (like a nut or dairy allergy) I would not trust this place to handle it.   If you like weird bagel combinations and living life on the edge, this location is for you. For me, I'll be sticking to better places nearby.",
