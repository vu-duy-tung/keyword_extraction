    "text": "I've only been in Pittsburgh a year and so far this is the best pizza in town.  Everything from the crust, to the cheese, to the sauce and to the toppings are top notch and very tasty.  But I had to take off one star for the service.  I always get carry out and 4 out of 5 times, the pizza took twice the amount I was told on the phone.  They are usually busy but come on.  On my last pick up order, I was told it would be 40 minutes.  Got there in 45 minutes and I had to wait another 40 minutes before I got my pizza.  If it wasn't for that, I'd probably eat here 1-2 times a week on a regular basis.  Just an update.  I cut down my rating to 1 star.  Since my last review, I was going here about 1-2 times a month.  What I've found is that their food quality has slipped (i.e. less toppings, inconsistency in cheese topping, etc)  and their service has gotten much worse.  The average time I have to wait beyond their stated time has increased and their rudeness has gotten much worse both on the phone and at the counter.  I am now in search of another pizza restaurant.",

    "text": "Another really bad Pittsburgh pizzeria that all on you yinzers can't get enough of.  Everything about this place is inconvenient.  They do not deliver and its pretty hard to find parking on the Aggro Crag-esque hill that the shop sits upon.  The interior is dirty and uninviting...I would even go so far as to call it \"rapey\".  After illegally parking with my 4 ways on and waiting for a few minutes one of the employees gave me my pie and I headed home.  The pie it self was a real mess. It is obvious just by looking at the pie that whoever made it took no pride in making it well, they just threw everything together and plopped it in the oven on a wing and a prayer.    The dough is some of the worst dough I have had yet in Pittsburgh.  They are using regular deck brick ovens and cooking the pies directly on the brick so there is no excuse for not being able to achieve some sort of crunch.  It is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all.  The taste of salt and sugar come through a little bit in a very generic way, almost like a Papa Johns tasting dough.  The main problem was that  the dough obviously didn't rise at all and was very dense and hard to chew.  Its a dry dough too, very dry.  Plus the pizza was made so poorly that the middle of the pie was paper thin and inedible while the outside of the pie was way too thick and was hard to chew.  Basically what we have here is another bowl-like pizza where all of the ingredients pool into the middle because it was made so poorly.    It is pretty clear who is wearing the pants in this pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and the pants are soaked.  I watched the kid making one of the pies and he just filled up both of his hands with 2 pounds of cheese and tossed it into the middle of the pizza and just kind of scattered it towards the outside and said \"yeah, that will do\".  They are using a really high quality cheese and it does have a great taste and it has that gummy effect that you would get if you ordered extra-cheese.  Unfortunately there is just way way too much of it for the pizza to even be edible in some spots.  You couldn't even pull a slice off of the pie to put it onto your plate without pulling all of the cheese off into a big pile in the middle.  They are using lots and lots of cheese to compensate for how bad the best of the pie sucks.  The sauce is very forgettable and watery.  They put very little sauce on the pie anyway and its applied with no pride in the traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern where you sauce in some spots and none in others.  The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste, un-offensive and maybe tasty if they were to ever put enough on for anyone to taste it.  In general this is just lazy pizza where they would rather give you 2 pounds of cheese than actually have to take pride in their food.  I feel my butt hole starting to cry as I near the end of this review, save yourselves the T.P. and just leave this one alone.    I am giving it a 4 out of 10.",

I asked who the manager was, and the one seemed the most cracked out was apparently the one in charge.

Called in and asked if they had any specials and got the reply,  \"we don't do specials,\" in a tone conveying that the question was so offensive that it barely deserved an answer.  As for the pizza, it was fine.  Probably the 16th best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh so far, out of about 20 places (the pizza made to order at my local Get Go is only a step behind it).  There's also the possibility my pies were sabotaged because of the aforementioned question I asked, maybe it was the pizza artists' saliva pooling up on the slices rather than grease...   There's a chance I might stop in the bar next to it again, but little chance I'll step foot into the overpriced pizza establishment next door.  One final note, any place with this much hype and known for its fresh ingredients yet uses canned mushrooms is f**ked.",

    "text": "We get take-out from here every so often to eat while we watch a Penguins or Steelers game at home, and as soon as we eat the food, we end up cursing ourselves for not choosing this pizza shop more often.  I always get the small tossed salad- it is a pretty big salad with iceberg mix, tomatoes, cucumbers, diced white onions, black olives, and loads of shredded mozzarella on top. For dressing, they make the Italian dressing in-house (it's pretty good but tastes better on a hoagie than a salad) but the other dressings, including the ranch dressing, are Marzettis packets, which I think is a great-tasting dressing. The veggies are always fresh and I have never been disappointed in this salad.  The meatball hoagie is also awesome- the meatballs are huge and the bread is toasted which is nice because otherwise the sauce would soak through and cause a messy sandwich. A half hoagie is more than enough for a meal so we normally split it and get buffalo wings (for him) and salad (for me).  Let me tell you, my SO is obsessed with all things hot sauce and wings. He gets them at practically every restaurant we go to, and these buffalo wings are THE BEST, without a doubt. The buffalo sauce is to die for and the wings are crunchy and delicious! They even sell the buffalo sauce to-go if you just cannot get enough. You HAVE to get buffalo wings here-  you won't regret it!  One thing that lacks is the parking. Not that it is in their control, but you will have a really tough time trying to find parking as they are on the corner of West Liberty and a steep brick hilly road that is always full on one side with people parallel-parked for the pizza shop or bar next door. We typically park at the gas station next door to them and buy some drinks for our meal so we don't feel so bad about using their lot for a few minutes. Don't let that stop you from eating here; it is so worth it!",

Service is great, restaurant is constantly full of happy, friendly customers...and the food is spectacular. Great prices, too.

    "text": "For how small and busy the restaurant is they are very fast and efficient. Their pizza is very unique in flavor and appearance. Never have I seen places put the toppings underneath the cheese, but Fiori's does it and it is awesome. The pizza also has an amazing balance between sweet and saltiness. The grease from the mozzarella cheeze oozes with flavor and compliments the sauce wonderfully. We always get a large Pepperoni and Mushroom and a Large Plain for most Penguin and Steeler games since moving to this side of the city and I haven't been disappointed once. Hands down best Pizza in the 'Burgh!",

    "text": "Fiori's is a pretty decent option for a pie. Nothing is offensive about their pizza, so it would appeal to most tastes, but that said, there are some issues with that approach that make it hard for Fiori's to compete in my mind with Mineo's or Aiello's. First is that there's nothing stand out special about the pie. The sauce is inoffensive, but sort of bland. Not overly seasoned. The crust at the end is good, but before you get to that, all the bread has been saturated with grease from the cheese or pepperoni, which is well seasoned but often a bit too charred for me. Some may prefer a crisper pepperoni, so that would suit their tastes. The cheese is not overwhelming, but it's also not particularly special.   This is just a middle of the road pizza to me. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Sometimes that's all you need.",

Spend the extra couple of bucks and get a side of cold cheese to top off your delicious slice of pizza heaven.  Something about it, I can't explain it, but it's magically delicious (sorry, Lucky Charms).  I'm sure someone will chime in with \"cold cheese? why not just go to Beto's?\"      If I wanted a bunch of cold stuff on a piece of bread, I'd make a sandwich.  Fiori's for the win.",

Sweet sauce, perfect amount of cheese, and crispy crust.   The staff is incredibly friendly - prices are comparable to Mineo's as well as a large is around $16. We usually go basic and get half plain half mushroom. They don't pile on a ton of toppings and I actually prefer it that way.  Hope to try one of their hoagies at some point as well.",

I get there in 5, park on the god awful stone hill only to find the place is packed.  Tables are full, people are standing waiting for thier order, and there are no more spots on the street.  So, I left.  I don't appreciate being lied too and I was in no mood for a long wait (thus calling ahead...).

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than True NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still delicious. A delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.  The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites: Fiori's Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch) Pizza Perfecta Aiello's (Murray Street) Beto's  Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.  I can't imagine anybody beating out Fiori's.  Their \"cuts\" (Pittsburgh parlance for \"slice\") were a perfect Pittsburgh version of NY style pizza.  Fiori's to me was the best in Pittsburgh because it had the perfect amounts of chew, char, crust, cheese, sauce.  The place itself has a perfect old school been-in-the-neighborhood-for-years vibe with a couple of tables and booths.  Unpretentious.  Neighborhood.  Open Late.  Perfect.",

    "text": "************ALERT:  THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*************  We just moved to Pittsburgh last winter and have been trying to locate an excellent Pizza place.  Most places we have tried seriously missed the mark-- often tasting like pizza you could get at a bowling alley.  We live in Brookline so we passed Fiori's a number of times, but finaly decided to go in.  Its been our go -to Pizza place ever since.  THIS PIZZA IS FANTASTIC------- IF YOU ORDER EXTRA SAUCE ON THE PIZZA!!!!  Thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.   It REALLY needs extra sauce.  I also agree with a previous reviewer that the Pizza is better,  as just plain cheese.   Skip the pepperoni and other toppings.  They just distract and cover up the amazing taste of the sauce cheese and crust. Plain cheese with extra sauce at Fiori's  is where its at!  We usually get a Large 16\" cheese Pizza with extra tomato sauce which costs $14.95.....  I'm telling you, you HAVE to order extra tomato sauce.  Forget extra cheese---- its already loaded with Cheese.    Their crust is fantastic , but it soaks up A LOT of the sauce, so you don't end up tasting the sauce much---- (unless you order extra)  wich is sad because their sauce is AMAZING!!!!! Sweet and tangy. ...  When you can taste it..... SO  JUST ORDER EXTRA SAUCE. Okay??? :) Trust me.  They do not deliver and have very little parking available, and they are STILL always packed.    Just extra confirmation that its GOOD PIZZA!    If you MUST take out, fine.   However,  I recomend Din-In whenever possible. Eating their pizza 3 minutes out of the oven, is quite a different experience than eating it after its sat in a box for 15-20 minutes.   Not that it sucks by the time you get it home....Its just waaayyy better right out of the oven.  Its a signifigant difference in flavor and texture. ORDER EXTRA SAUCE, too!!!",

It was sweet but I really didn't notice it until she brought it to my attention. Others say it tastes like someone poured a bunch of sugar into that. I don't understand that...sauce is supposed to be a little bit sweet.  My fault was in the crust. Crust, sauce and toppings make a pizza. If you have excellent toppings and delicious sauce on top of a crappy crust, you have a crappy pizza. There's no way around this. This crust wasn't anything to write home about. I didn't eat the ends which should say something. The crust wasn't crispy, it ended up getting soggy before we were done eating it. Also, the pizza itself was constructed poorly. The crust itself was about 2 inches long. And then there's about an inch of two of sauce before you even get to the cheese. It really looks like some eight grader put the pizza together. Seriously, cheese should cover the sauce and there was a huge gap between the sauce and the cheese.  Everything tasted good, though. Tons of cheese...I really liked the cheese. It is chewy though, but I appreciated that. The sauce was sweet but nothing out of the ordinary. The pepperoni was tasty, too. Everything tasted fine, the texture of the crust and the sloppy pizza construction were negatives. Still, I do not understand why this place is considered that great. Just a normal pizza place serving normal pizzas.",

    "text": "This is a dive.  A True dive.  The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.    It really doesn't matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won't come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven't arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!  With the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don't stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don't follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:  First Trip only: Garlic bread Hot wings  Both Trips: Meatballs (x2) and red sauce Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\" - 8 cut)  The meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.    Our pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.    I must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn't unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...    They only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.  NOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won't like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork.",

We decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not disappointed.  Fiori's feels like a place out of a Ben Afflack movie--the neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other.  In our half an hour there, I must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town.  Onto the pizza!  We got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars!  Thin crust that was crispy, not overly cheesy or saucy--although the sauce did have a distinct sweet flavor.  Baked to perfection--lightly golden brown.  Enjoyable flavor!  If you have been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it's a similar style with a different taste.    Overall: the pizza is good, atmosphere is easy! Don't listen to the haters, although parking is a pain.",

The last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former.   Overall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold, for breakfast.",

    "text": "My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always True.  Fiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.  But then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh.",

I have to say overall I liked it- but with a few caveats.  Parking stinks.  Don't bother eating in, just get take out. Grab a friend, have them drive and run in to pick up your pie. My quick bite of pizza took over two hours from finding a parking space, standing in line to order, waiting for my pizza to be made, getting a table with said pizza (there is very limited seating for eating in), eating and finally wriggling past the other waiting people to get out to search for the car. The place is CASH ONLY, no credit cards so make sure you got a twenty to buy your pie. (Fortunately they have an ATM on site but the fees!)  All my complaints aside, I did enjoy my pizza. The sweetness of the sauce was balanced by the saltiness of the olives they exuberantly provided on my pizza. The crowd of people in there provided for a quite interesting people-watching experience. The slices of pizza were unevenly divided and my eating companions were quick to grab what might have been fold-able slices, but I feel like folding was a possibility for the crust.  Overall, I'd go back.",

Since DeMino's in Brookline is strictly take-out only (I guess I'll have to yelp them another time), I told my friend to take me to Fiori's this evening. I'm all about second chances after all.  Well we actually had the pizza there, and I am not kidding you, IT WAS  WORSE THAN I REMEMBERED IT!  This cheese could be used to stop up a leaky pipe. I still think they put Swiss cheese in with the mozzarella. The more I chewed it, the tougher it got! It didn't even stay on the pizza. In fact, it came off in sheets!  The only topping I got on the small pizza were meatballs, and Fiori's is not only tightfisted with them. They also had no flavor.  Actually, I take that back. They tasted like catfood.  Sweet catfood that is.  The whole pizza was sweet and not in a good way. It was as if someone grabbed the sugar instead of the salt by mistake.   And somebody's doctorin' the sauce or stretchin' it with some good old Heinz 57.   We also split an italian hoagie. That bread was seriously overbaked and therefore too crunchy.   Fiori's also attracted a rather, uh...douchey clientele this particular evening?   Seriously, I loved the three frat boy morons (are they a 'protected class'?) in the booth behind us, especially the one who thought he was Brad Pitt ('I'm so kewl I eat with shades on').   And his buddy Potsy (the token lame-o in the pecking order that just HAS to belong).  And the \"jock\" with the wee-little ponytail from 1993. This trio could have come straight out of any high school movie.   I mean, I loved them so much, I wished they were transported back in time to a South Side bar circa 1974 so they could get their little white boy behinds handed to them by some steelworkers. Y'know? People that actually make the world function?   The laws shield those who goof on everyone they see. I mean, they were actually turning their heads, sneering, looking for people to make fun of, even openly leering and commenting on guy's wives. Thank God they didn't notice my friend and I. Bad pizza makes me...surly.   And what was up with having MSNBC's \"Lockup\" on TV while everyone was eating? Yeah, I really wanna eat dinner while I watch guys gush blood after having been shanked.  Anyway, there are better pizza parlors in Brookline. Fiori's is but fodder for the Brookline Pizza Wars and didn't even survive the first salvo. Why this place has such a cult surrounding it I'll never know. No wonder they're open until 3AM on a Saturday night. You'd have to be blotto as well as famished to enjoy their food.

I ordered a small (8 cut) pepperoni pizza, which was enough to feed 2 people. The pepperoni was under the cheese and every bite was delicious! I ate 4 pieces in one sitting    Parking was tough for pick-up, but the food was well worth it. I'll be back for sure!!",

    "text": "I hardly ever gallivant in the South Hills, but it was a rare weekend where I found myself having crossed a river and in need of nourishment. My trusty Yelp app told me that apparently some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh could be had at this little storefront in Beechview, so I decided to give it a whirl.  First thing's first. As other reviewers have noted, it appears that parking is a pain here. It's located at the bottom of what looks to be a death trap of a cobblestone hill where you need to find a street spot and then hope your parking brake doesn't fail you. However, Fiori's does have like 3 off-street spots directly beside the building...fortune must've smiled upon us that day, because we were able to snag one of those.  The inside is quite small and adorably old school. You can see the workers tossing pizza dough and firing up your food in their ovens, which I always love to watch. There are like 3 tables and maybe 4 booths in here, and this place is POPULAR. We went at 2pm on a Saturday and there wasn't a table to be had (and many people waiting). It's open seating, so if you come during a peak time, you've just got to shark a table and hope you get lucky (again, we somehow were fortunate and happened to be standing by a table that left right as our food came out, so we were able to jump on it).   You order at the counter, and they bring your food to you. We got some cheese sticks to start and then split a small pizza. Now, usually cheese sticks are cheese sticks and all taste about the same, but these were notably good! I don't know if they are homemade, but they sure tasted like it. The breading was different than a typical from-the-bag-of-frozen type of cheese stick. The dipping sauce was unique...like a puree with no chunks (I actually prefer chunky marinara with my sticks, but this was still tasty).  As for the pizza, heed my advice: wait a couple of minutes before digging in. Both my husband and I destroyed the roof of our mouths because we didn't realize how hot the pizza was. It literally comes straight from the oven to your table (which is awesome, but I'm apparently too much of a fat ass to realize that I needed to wait for it to cool off). Second-degree burns notwithstanding, the pizza was tasty! This is the type of pizza that you definitely need to dab with a few napkins beforehand to soak up all of the grease that is oozing from it. They definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The sauce is thin and has just a hint of sweetness. And the crust is crispy...the kind of crust that gives you that delightful crunch when you bite into it. That's a nice change from the standard chewy crust that a lot of pizza shops in Pittsburgh seem to go with.  Is it the best pizza in Pittsburgh, like many reviewers claim? Well, pizza is subjective. It was definitely tasty and I'd go back the next time I'm in the neighborhood. But I have yet to find pizza in Pittsburgh that seems worthy of the \"Best Of\" title. Fiori's, however, certainly holds its own.",

Now before all of you non-believers begin slinging obscenities at me, just know that I realize that pizza preference is very subjective. But also if you don't have a preference for Fiori's, you're wrong.   What makes Fiori's the best:  1. There's a gallon of grease on each slice 2. There's 52 pounds of cheese on each slice  3. The cheese is dispersed evenly so that every bite is the BEST BITE. 4. The sauce is slightly sweet but not too sweet. 5. The crust is perfectly foldable while being the perfect combination of chewy and crispy.  6. The parking is terrible, so you know it must be good!  I've eaten in a couple of times, but we usually just get take out. Regardless, every pizza has been consistently delicious. Their spaghetti and meatballs are good too if you're into that sort of thing.  A Love Poem for Fiori's: Ooey gooey pizza pie, You're the apple of my eye. I love you more than any guy, Don't tell my husband, kthxbye",

Hands down the best pizza in the Pittsburgh region. Unfortunately its on the opposite side of town. Luckily for me a good friend lives much closer to the shop who visits me on a weekly basis.

    "text": "Anyone who says this is not the best pizza in Pittsburgh is just full of shit.  It's that simple.   I grew up in Mt. Lebanon (the South Hills) and I used to eat Mineo's Pizza (at it's original location in Dormont) as a kid.   I moved to NYC after high school and have lived there for many years now.  I have also spent a lot of time all over Italy.  So I know good pizza.   FIORE'S is as good as it gets.  The cheese is buttery, creamy, plentiful.  The sauce is perfectly seasoned and generous.  The crust is the very rare combination of crunchy and chewy.  Spectacular!  I am in Pittsburgh for a family wedding this week...so tonight I swung by FIORE'S to grab a whole pizza for my Italian sisters and I.  I got the plain...sometimes I like toppings, yet tonight I felt like the pure original.  It didn't disappoint!  All the elements work together to create a perfect symphony of flavors and textures.    This place has been here for many, many years.  It is located on a very steep and bumpy cobblestone road...totally off the main drag.  There is NO WAY that this place could have survived for so long if it was anything less than the best pizza you've ever tasted.  I actually get cravings for FIORE'S while living in NYC.  It just doesn't get any better.  So don't be a jagoff...be grateful you live in the Burgh, and go get yourself some FIORE'S pizza an'at!",

I placed our order and he said don't come down here it's going to be at least an hour to we can get to you if my coworkers can do anything right. That was really unprofessional. Some people may think that character but really I don't care what kind of a day the person taking the pizza order is having I just want to place my order without feeling im bothering them,  You should know that you will have to illegally parked your car to pick your order up.  the place was filthy inside and it was packed full of people and total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating in store even if the place was clean up you're still going to have people waiting to pick three orders of standing right over you. It was also about a hundred degrees in there. They also only take cash with they didn't mention and there was no sign so I was glad I had cash on hand.  I knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy.",

Thin crust, sweet sauce, generous melty cheese....heaven to my tastebuds. It's also great cold! I can eat a Fiori's slice hot, cold, any time of day. Personally, the plain is my favorite but really, you can't go wrong with any of the toppings as long as you get the red sauce as your base. Fiori's also has a white pizza that I wouldn't mind having from time to time, but the red sauce is where it's at!  One downfall is that they don't deliver. It's a bummer, but it makes driving there to grab a pie all the more special. Another downfall is that it's located on the most annoying cobblestone hill with very limited parking, but man is it worth the trouble getting there!",

The Italian hoagie needed more dressing and it was mostly bread. Everyone was saying that this is the best pizza but I lived here all my life and it was just \"ok\". The crust was a bit over cooked and the toppings was hardly cooked. It's like they cooked the pizza first, placed the toppings, then warmed them some more.  There was minimal sauce, so little that all I tasted was the crust and the toppings.  It wasn't the best I had and it wasn't the worst, just one of your run of the mill pizza joint.",

My dinner craving wandered around to pizza and never departed. I knew what I had to do. A quick call to Fiori's for a pick-up order while driving was a perfect solution and after a stop to Capital Ave to pick up my delicious oven hot pizza I was on my way home ready to devour. I was not disappointed, delicious!  Regrettably, I have not had Fiori's in many years (for shame, I know). Mostly laziness for pick-up (no delivery option) led me to other sub-par pizzeria's, or no pizza at all, for much too long. Upon relocating back to the city earlier this year I was bound and determined to reestablish my taste buds for the best pizza around, and nothing less would suffice. While I am an equal opportunity pizza eater, there is definitely something to be said for finding the kind of pizza that satiates your pizza cravings, in my case it's the basics--good crust, good sauce, and good cheese. Fiori's nails all three.",

I recall memories with my family at my nana's house in Brookline, collecting pizza orders for dinner from my aunts, uncles, and cousins.  I always got to go pick it up with my aunt or my dad, sitting shotgun with the hot pizza on my lap. I remember, vividly, hearing \"Don't tilt it! Keep it flat!\" so the mounds of cheese wouldn't slide to one end.   This is my favorite pizza for several reasons: 1. The sauce is sweet and there's a LOT of it. 2. The sausage is meaty, fatty and has the perfect amount of fennel seed. 3. The crust is crunchy, and chewy, and the rest of the pizza is just flexible enough that you handle it (long enough for it to make it to your mouth without all the cheese sliding off!)   Though a little pricey for a whole pie, Fiori's is always worth it. I'm lucky enough that when I come home to visit there's usually always a Fiori's pizza on the stove.   Now the new trend (new for me) is to get a cup of cold cheese on the side, and top your slice with it while it's steaming hot. I think there's plenty of cheese on it already, so I usually don't get the cold cheese.  Hands down, this is the best pizza that I've ever had, and the best pizza in Pittsburgh by far.",

The pizza is a bit dry due to lack of sauce and the taste of the sauce is pretty generic aka bland. On the positive side the cheese and crust are good.

If you are in the area, stop by and try a slice and be your own judge.   We will definitely stop back through whenever in the area. Don't think it will be an out of the way destination though with other options around our neighborhood.   This place can get pretty crowded and parking is very sparse so make sure you have someone that can run in and pay while you either drive around or wait.",

    "text": "This place is super busy! Ordered a large half cheese half pepperoni and an order of 6 hot wings. The pepperoni half of the pizza had the pepperoni layered under the cheese, which was interesting. I felt like there was too much topping on the pepp half. I don't like the pepp to be overwhelming. But the sauce, crust, and cheese were all very good. Could have used a smidge more oregano or some sort of flavoring. The wings really knocked it out of the park. They were a good size, crispy, not too greasy, and had a very delicious sauce. The hot was hot enough to have a zing, but not so hot that they were inedible. Parking was a bit tricky, but if you're patient, there is a constant churn of people so you'll get a spot. There isn't a ton of seating inside but they do have several booths and tables. There are also some games to play (like pinball) while you wait. The workers are nice and seem to be fairly organized given how busy this place can get!",

It's 'NewYorkStyle' with a distinct flavour, ever-so-slightly on the sweet side, moderately heavy on the cheese, well done bottom - fold it in half and have at it. I make my own amazing pizza at home these days, but, if I want to splurge, I place a big take-out order at Fiori's, like I did for my birthday party last week. Pies, wings, hoagies, and salads - I called in a big order that night and they cranked it out, perfectly, without skipping a beat. It was sooo good! Reliably delicious, I've been eating Fiori's for 24 years.",

Each one has its special little touch but what people don't realize is the dough and sauce are what make the pizza taste different. Here you get a completely different taste from your everyday pizza and I think that's the drawing point. However I think it's a little over priced and not worth parking and getting from.   Place used to be a dump but since has fixed it up a bit. Good place to stop after a long night of drinks and bar hopping though, but just do pick up. The place will most likely be packed.",

Loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it. Knowing I don't eat meat my friends ordered me a half pizza with peppers and onions. It was still dripping with grease. I removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables. I was still kind of dumbfounded as to why this place gets raves. The crust was nothing to write home about, it was just kind of yeasty and chewy. I definitely don't see what all the fuss is. When I'm going to have a cheat day with pizza it's Beto's for me.",

The Fat Kid has eaten at MANY a pizza shop in this fair town and others, and I can say this with full confidence, that hands down, Fiori's is the best Pizza in the Burgh, and one of the best that has ever filled The Fat Kid's tummy anywhere.   The combination of things that Fiori's has in the pizza is what makes it special. A tremendous sweet sauce that still has a bite of tang to it when you get into it enough, the best crust ANYWHERE ( I believe Sprite is added to the crust or something of the sort to give it this flavor), tremendously thick, gooey, tasty cheese, it's fair share of grease (which ALL good pizzas MUST have, as eating pizza without grease is like drinking coffee without caffeine, it is just senseless), and excellent toppings when cooked in.   The Fat Kid usually will get his pie with Extra Cheese and Pepperoni, and this is by all means, the most fabulous of Fiori's combos, as the Roni's are always delish and the Cheese just makes the flavor of the Pizza swell and burst with intensity when it hits your palate.  Clearly, it is humorous to read some of the reviews on here, especially one's that endorse garbage Pizza like Krazy Brothers (Out Of Business), Vincent's (heavy and burnt and overgreasy), Molly's (cardboard dipped in vomit is better than a Molly's pie or most anything else from there, which is tremendously overpriced) are clear second-tier pies that just do not have the flavor to please an experienced palate like the Fiori's pie does.   Don't stop there though, the Cap and Cheese is tremendous, as is the Steak and Cheese sub, with a very nicely cooked hoagie bun that is both flavorful and of a fantastic texture, very similar to an old Latina Pizza hoagie (maybe the best Steak and Cheese in the Burgh at Latina's), and the sweet sauce that is put on this sub makes it one to die for. the Cap and Cheese is just a virtual monster of flavor, with a nice spicy kick.  Take it from The Fat Kid, when you come to the Buirgh, come to Fiori's. No one knows food like a Fat Kid, and you can lay safe money on that...",

I think you get the point.   Fiori's is all of those things and more. They are, in my mind, the best Pizza place in Pittsburgh. I know that is a highly debatable topic, but when people from the North Shore bother to go to south hills to a little hole in the wall place with no parking and hardly any room to eat inside, you know it's good.   I lived in Brookline for 2 years and would frequent this place. I would say that eating the pizza in the shop is better than taking it out. Even though it's a small place it's worth it to go to that lightly crispy crust something you don't get when it sit's in a box waiting for you to pick it up.   Also the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don't even bother putting toppings on your pizza. The topping is overshadowed by the sweet sause and the mountain of cheese so don't waist your money. It's better that way, trust me!",

The pizza itself is massive, about 16 in or little more. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back here. The hill the place is located on is killer! and there's practically no parking.

The crust is tasty and perfectly baked; a healthy amount of cheese is topped on the not-overly-sweet-but-tasty-nonetheless sauce; and thick slices of pepperoni adorn the top.  My only rub is that the bar next door is one of those in Pennsylvania that allows smoking; merely walking past the door rekindles childhood memories of my mother burning through her two packs of Winston's daily.",

This is a pizza people can and should go out of their way for. It's in an unassuming building across from a gas station and can be easily missed but once you've eaten here, you'll begin craving it just by seeing the sign for Dormont. Parking can be quite difficult (I type this as I wait on a precariously steep hill waiting for my boyfriend to bring out our pizza) so keep that in mind if you're coming here with a group. A measure of a good pizza shop is how well they do up a traditional pepperoni and Fiori's does it well.",

That being said, this was some damn fine pizza and I understand anew why it's is so beloved. The crust was fantastic , pep under the cheese , got a medium sausage ta boot .  Pretty good sauce (I like spicey and salty sauce, as opposed to sweet so this was really good all in all, if you never had Fiori's, it definitely lived up to its rep.

We have some of the best and not that Deep Dish stuff but I digress.  This was a great slice not thick, not super greasy and really good. The sauce was fantastic and put it over the top.  Which I had from some reviews where it was \"bland\" I am not sure what they were eating but it was not from here.  The criteria for a good slice: 1. The Crust, this was perfect. 2. The sauce, this was very good. 3. Cheese to crust ratio: on point.  All in all, a great atmosphere and an even better pizza.",

The person who took our order was very inviting and friendly.   After looking at how big the pizzas were, my fiance and I opted to share a small pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. Plenty of cheese on top so you'll see a cheese pull when picking up the slice. Being from Louisiana, I'm not used to the meat being under the cheese, but the spice of the pepperoni with the sweetness of the sauce made a tasty combination. There is a bit of grease on top of the pizza which we were fine with.   We also saw a lot of people getting the carton of Turner's Iced Lemon Tea and decided to try it. Although I'm not a fan of lemon flavored tea, this one is a must.   Overall, great taste and great pizza. Will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "This is the same little pizza shop where they filmed the movies \"Blind Fiori\" and \"The Fast And The Fiori-us.\" So make sure you grab a slice for your girlfriend, wife, sister, mother, daughter, Aunt or ant. Because hell hath no Fiori like a woman without pizza.  What to get: A slice with a pot of white cheese on the side Why: Because I just said the word \"pot\" and you thought of drugs and that says a lot about you Like in a bad way?: I'm not here to pass judgment, I'm just here to pass the ball to Antwaan Randle-El.  How to improve: Offer a range of different slices rather than just cheese.  I was fiori fiori impressed with Fiori's from the first time I tried it, over 10 years ago.  They're open super late at night, but coming here after 11pm is a little creepy, especially in winter. The roads in these parts are silent and dead. The towering hills blink down at you as you go through the tunnel or along the winding lanes. When you finally find this little spot, on a steep cobbled side street that leads up to nowhere, it's next to a dive bar and a silent gas station. You might see the Pittsburgh version of a tumbleweed blow by. Be brave and head on in for the best slice in town.  It's the kind of pizza that, if it were on the other side of a river, you'd take a fiori across just to get it.  To this day, it remains the only Pizzeria that calls itself a Pizzaria, in my experience. It's also the best slice in Pittsburgh, a little ahead of Aiello's, Pizza Italia and Fazio's, which are 3 other similar slices, which complete the \"quadfecta\" of the best slices in a town that has very unique pizza.  Einstein knew all about this pizza. It's where he came up with his Fiori of Relativity.  It's unique in how bland and plain and simple it is. It's all about the extra-floury extra-white dough, and the small amounts of sauce and conservative layer of cheese. It actually works though. No other city makes pizza like Pitt, and when I'm in town I rarely miss the opportunity to enjoy one of these slices of heaven.  This was the first slice in space (Fiori Gagarin), so that in itself is a reason to try it.  I heard a long time ago that you should ask for a pot of white cheese on the side. They don't seem to be too familiar with the concept, but they gladly do it and it's pretty cheap. The white cheese is yum, and goes well with the already cheesy, slightly-dry pizza. I recommend getting a drink with your slice.  Also, full disclosure: I often get this pizza for a girl to try and seduce her. It's my form of Fioriplay.",

    "text": "Double crust: Just when I thought Fiori's couldn't be any better, somebody told me to order my pizza with a double crust, or thick crust. It's just too good to describe in words. It's not super thick like Sicilian, but you definitely have a thicker crust than the regular Fiori's pizza, which is totally delicious on its own.  The rivalry for best Pittsburgh pizza typically gets booked as Mineo's versus Aiello's, but Fiori's in Dormont is hands down Numero Uno. Here's why- The sauce is seasoned, slightly sweet, and applied in perfect proportion. The cheese is top quality, and again applied in perfect proportion. The toppings are top-quality, again applied in perfect proportion. But really the ultimate deciding factor is the crossed-which is far superior to any other pizza crust in Pittsburgh.  Why my emphasis on proportions? Because Mineos puts up so I would pound of pizza cheese on their large pizza, it's no jokes nearly a quarter of an inch of pizza cheese. Aiellos (my number 2 choice because of their garlic sauce) marinara sauce is just too sweet.   Also the Italian salad at Fiori's is delicious. Definitely worth getting to accompany your pizza.",

On top of great pizza, Fiori's hoagies are some of the best around. My favorite is the Italian with banana peppers.   The only downside to Fiori's is the parking. It can be frustrating at busy times.

First off parking is impossible which isn't a huge deal. I ordered a pizza and an Italian sausage hoagie. The pizza is a hot  mess. You open the box and that's what it looks like. Just thrown together with no care at all. I love cheese but the amount of cheese they put on is ridiculous. I guess they do this to cover the taste of the non existing crust. This pizza felt like I was eating a pound of cheese mixed with sauce. The pizza is a 1.5 stars max.  The Italian sausage I really enjoyed. Again way to much cheese. Seriously, what's the deal with all the freaking cheese! Anyways the sausage  had a great texture and taste to it. Just the right amount of peppers and the hoagie was soft and had a great feel to it. I give it a 4.  I may give the pizza another try. It was a Friday night, they were very busy and maybe just rushed. I will probably go back to try the other hoagies.",

    "text": "This is hands down the absolute best pizza in Pittsburgh, and that's really saying something because Pittsburgh has some great pizza places. Their pizza is amazing-- it's not fancy, and a little bit sweet, but truly the best pizza you can buy in the city. Their calzones are similarly amazing.  My parents used to go to Fiori's when they were dating, and even now it's one of their favorites. They moved out to Boise, Idaho a few years ago, but every time they're back in the 'Burgh Fiori's is the first place we stop, if that tells you anything. Apparently, it's just as good now as it was when it opened in the 70s.   Do yourself a favor and stop in. Plus, they redid the parking lot pretty recently, so it's easier than ever ;-)",

    "text": "It's national pizza day so doing a pizza search on Yelp, decided this would be the place to try as I've ears great things about it.  There's something about small \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurants and this is a gem of a pizza joint. Parking is on a hilly, cobblestone street, or a private lot off the main road. Tonight was a busy night with limited seating. They have a decent amount of seats but seems they do a lot of takeout orders. If dining in, order at the counter and take a seat. Even though they were slammed it only took about 20 minutes for my large pie, and I could have waited double that for this delicious pizza. Definitely one of my favorites, plenty of flavor and tasty hand tossed dough makes this better than most. Service is attentive and friendly. They have a good menu selection not just pizzas but calzones and hoagies as well.  I'll definitely be back again to support small business and this locally owned business.",

I always order green pepper pizza because they use fresh green peppers ( not those bitter canned / jarred ones ) wish the mushrooms were fresh but I am willing to over see that ... the pizza sauce is on the sweeter side but compliments the fresh chewy pizza dough .. that has just the right amount of \" crunch\" around the edges.. the cheese they use tastes like a motz/ prov blend .. and has a great sharpness to it .. I could order from these guys every day ( if my waistline would stay the same !) I only had their sandwiches a few times .. I can vouch that the steak hoagie is made with Real Steak .. that's shaved .. no steak umms !",

Customer service is ok, they are very punctual as I ordered by phone for pickup and they had it ready by the time I arrived. The pizza was piping hot and steam was even exiting the box! By the time we got home the pizza was still super hot and fresh! The taste of the crust and the amount of crisp was just right! The toppings taste of great quality, and (as I've been told) are home made. We had a pepperoni pizza and a sausage pizza. I was told their sausage was their best pizza and I have to say, it was great! I even preferred their sausage over my usual pepperoni! They put their cheese over their toppings so that's a little bit of a unique touch! The mix of flavors that their pizza has is fantastic and I would defiantly recommend giving their sausage pizza a try, even if you aren't typically a fan of sausage like myself.",

    "text": "So Fiori's is delicious. Let's just get that out there!   Fiori's is as good as people say it is. They've got their pizza recipe down to a science. They use a high quality cheese that tastes much better than standard pizza places and their tomato sauce is very slightly sweet. I've tried Fiori's a couple of times and it's consistently good.  I prefer the individual slices of pizza (~$2.75) rather than the whole pizza (~14 for small). The slices seem to be crispier after they re-heat your slice in their over upon ordering. Whereas the bottom of the whole pizzas are a little softer and can get soggy by the time you get home. However, sticking the whole pizza back in the oven does the trick.  I would recommend calling your order in as Fiori's does get busy, has long lines, and very limited parking. Overall, Fiori's is the best pizza I've tried in Pittsburgh!",

We ordered a 6 oz. side of sauce with our large pizza to go and it really made those crusty final bites of each slice all the more delectable.    We ordered on a Saturday night and called ahead - wait time was around 40 mins so that worked out perfectly with our commute from the North Hills.  Yes, we crossed a river and drove through a tunnel for this pizza.  And, we'd do it again.  It's worth every penny.  Their buffalo wings are another fantastic story in and of themselves.  Try them well done.  The sauce was really, really good and the wings were meaty and crispy.  Yowza good!  Get thee some Fiori's!",

    "text": "Wow!   This is very good pizza.   I used a competing delivery service (doordash) and ordered a Meatball, Onion, and Mushroom Pizza and a dozen hot wings.  Fiori's Pizzaria was like finding a Unicorn.   I have heard so much about it from life long residents but never had the opportunity to visit myself.  The previous reviews were correct (they live up to the street hype).   Wings - the wings were warm, had great flavor, and great texture (I don't like soggy chicken wings that you usually get from pizzerias.)  The pizza -  The crust tasted as if it was made that day.   I have mad a pie or two in my life from scratch.  The pizza crust had the texture and flavor than any that I made personally (maybe I am a bad pizza maker).   It passed my stand test (I am against droopy pizza slices), was airy and chewy.  The Sauce - The sauce was thick (not runny like you will find on cheaper pizzas) surprisingly not acidic.   My opinion but when you see a thick sauce it is usually very acidic.   Fiori's did a great job of avoiding traps (adding sugar and making the sauce too sweet thus removing the acidity).    The Ingredients - They all tasted fresh and was the correct amount.   Mushrooms looked fresh (not canned), onions were fresh, and the meatballs were dispersed across the pizza.  A high recommend if you are in the 'burgh.",

The only thing I would do next time I went was to ask for it \"well done.\"  Dont get me wrong, the pizza was hot, but a few more minutes would have given it that browned top and just a little crisper bottom crust. (Which I personally like)  I am definitely going back!  If you are looking for New York style pizza I would give this place a try!",

    "text": "Being a Pittsburgh area native this is by far the best in the region! We make special trips to the city just so that we can get the large pizza to share.   The thin crust and slightly sweet sauce is rather addicting.   We have a game we play when it's served HOT that we must separate the slices and wait five minutes before eating. It's super tempting to bite in as soon as you get it but you're gonna burn your mouth and ruin the experience. TRUST ME. WORTH THE WAIT.   Been coming here faithfully now for two years since it was introduced to me by someone who had been coming for 20 years prior.    Family owned and you also are able to meeting and see the original Mr. Fiori making pizzas in the front window. Staff is awesome and super friendly. Have built good friendships because there is a minimal turn over in staff. Some of the guys are ALWAYS there.   Seating can be tight if you don't time it right but that's because it's the best. The turn over of tables is quick. Usually someone walks in and then someone else shortly walks out.   Only about a 20 minute wait for the pizza to be cooked(most days).    Love you Fiori's!",

    "text": "Fiori's is always at, or near the top of the \"best pizza in Pittsburgh\" argument, and rightly so.   Simply put, the pizza is great. An overdose of cheese, sweet sauce, and a seemingly-sweet crust make's Fiori's pizza crave-worthy. How's the rest of the menu, you might wonder? I've always been a big fan of their chicken parm hoagie. The bread they use just softens up perfectly for take out orders. I've tried the meatballs and pasta, as well, and  while both are good, I have to stick with the real gems: the hoagies and pizza.  The only drawbacks are that Fiori's is cash only (but cheap!), they don't have delivery, and parking can be rough. Plus, it gets packed in the evening and late at night, so expect about a 40-minute wait to pick your pizza up. Regardless, if someone asks if it's worth it? The answer is always a resounding \"YES!\"",

I have heard some say that the pizza is too cheesy, and I agree in that it is very cheesy - but I enjoyed it greatly.  I had a small pie with capicola and banana pepper rings.  My only complaint was that I felt like there were too many pepper rings, but that's probably a personal preference.    If you're looking for thin crust 'za, this is not your jam.  The crust is doughy but crisp on the outside.  If you like more sauce than cheese, not your cup of tea (great Napoli-style pizza can be found at Il Pizzaiolo Mt. Lebanon).  Crispy crust? Check out Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville.  Otherwise, go to Fiori's!  (It's best for takeout, and was quick for that.  There aren't many tables and the place is small.  If you're looking for a nice dine-in experience, I suggest you go elsewhere!)",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my wife and a friend for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to find this place absolutely packed.  That meant that there wasn't any good parking spots available and so we had to park halfway up Capital Ave which if you don't know is a very steep cobblestone road.  The good news for us upon entering is that we were able to snag a table which was great as it seemed like people were waiting for tables the whole time that we were there.  The inside of Fiori's is somewhat small and I think they have 4 booths and 3 tables for seating as well as a pinball machine in one of the corners.  On this night our party decided to be simple and we ordered two large cheese pizzas for our table.  After taking a seat we probably waited around 20 minutes or so before our pizzas were ready for us.  The pizza ended up being pretty good and I can see why people in the South Hills always rave about Fioris.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crust which I thought had a really good crisp and a somewhat sweet flavor to it.  The cheese was also really good and there was a ton of it. Last but not least was the sauce whose flavor seemed to get lost with the cheese and crust.  So overall it was a pretty good pizza with my only complaint being that I could not for the life of me get the cheese to stay on the pizza while I was eating it.  Every time I took a bite or tried to cut it all of the cheese seemed to come off the rest of the slice.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the sweetness and crispiness of the crust and thought that there cheese was good as well.  Now if they can only do something about the parking situation outside.",

    "text": "This pizzeria with the motto \"We'll fix you up\" was recommended to us, so we decided to give this open-late pie place a try. It was a trip delayed by wrecks on the Parkway and construction on the Liberty Bridge, but it was worth the trip. It was busy with most of the tables full and a line of people picking up orders. Despite that, the service was excellent; and our pizza was in front of us in about 10-15 minutes. The sauce was great with the pepperoni hiding and sharing flavor beneath the cheese that came away in those hanging shreds as we lifted the slices to our plates. I like a little thinner crust, but that's just me. Give it a try sometime.",

    "text": "Fiori's pizza is amazing! When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh over four years ago, we rented a home in Brookline. As soon as coworkers learned where I lived, they said, \"You have to try Fiori's.\"   We would order Fiori's for any occasion... from a quiet don't-feel-like-cooking Tuesday night to a big birthday party. Though takeout is great, I highly recommend eating in the restaurant. The pizza tastes even more incredible when eaten immediately.  Fiori's pizza has a sweet, doughy crust that tastes a little extra crispy when eaten immediately vs. doughier when taken home. The sauce is also sweet, and the pizza is covered in a thick layer of cheese. Don't make the mistake of ordering toppings. Any Fiori's lover knows that you eat Fiori's with just the cheese.  Mmm... even thinking about their pizza makes me crave it. Plus, the good news is that they've recently opened a second location and now take credit cards! Hopefully, they continue to expand within the Pittsburgh area and introduce people outside of the south hills to their delicious product.",

It's the very thin NY style, greasy, the cheese and toppings wanna slide right off. And though tasty, we got double pepperoni, which in my mind means the pepperonis should be pretty much covering the pizza and YES I realize that they were under the cheese but just not enough. Waiting for the pizza to cool down helped the topping slide problem a bit, but yeah not a big fan of crust this thin. For NY style though, they got it down pat, so that's why the 3 stars. Plus I respect this joint a lot. :)",

The place is very genuine all the way around. If you like cheesy pizza with a sweet sauce, eat Fiori's pizza.   They also have very good hoagies. I get the Italian hoagie sometimes and it comes nice and crispy. Nothing worse than a soggy sandwich. They also have rigatoni and pasta sauce. Many toppings for the pizzas too. Sausage and onion pizza is out of this world. Now I'm making myself hungry.",

Their pies are always fresh right from the oven and you can see the crew make every one. There is some seating in the spot, but it can fill up fast on a Saturday night.  The pizzas are great just on their own with no toppings, but if you want to jazz it up the toppings are fresh and super tasty. You can even order a side of mozzarella to put on top of your slice! The hoagies are also fairly large and enough for at least two to share. I've tried the steak hoagie previously and instead of a white/cheese sauce it comes with a red \"secret\" sauce which is really good.  So the next time you're looking for pizza, stop by Fiori's for a pie that will leave you coming back for more!",

I grew up in Central New York and have spent a considerable amount of time in New York City where it's difficult to find bad pizza. That being said, I was delighted to find Fiori's. The staff was friendly upon arrival and patient as we looked at the menu. The menus pizza section says \"thick crust\" which made me nervous as I was hoping for a thin crust NY style. I asked if they do a thin crust and also how thick their normal crust is. The pizza maker showed me what the standard crust looks like and it was exactly what I was hoping for. So we ordered a large pie, half meatball and half Italian sausage and it was delicious. Fresh and plentiful cheese with a nice sauce. Sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it. The gentleman who made our pizza brought it to our table and offered grated cheese and red pepper flakes. Very friendly atmosphere with a big screen tv which was showing a soccer game at the time. It's worth the trip into the south hills for this pizza as many locals had told me. We will definitely be back",

    "text": "Honestly this is the only place we ever get pizza from anymore in this town! I can only vouch for the plain cheese pizza and calzone, they are fantastic though. I would try the mushrooms but judging by reviews I cannot figure out if they're fresh or canned so I'm satisfied with the plain cheese.   It's a small place so we always just bring it home, but it's so good straight out the oven that we usually inhale a slice right away in the car haha before driving home.  I've tried a lot of pizza places in town, like most of them, and fioris just is consistently the best compared to everywhere else (maybe except for benny fiero's in the south side but uh at more than double the price that's just unreasonable ya know?). And I wanted to add, I noticed that a lot of the reviews take points off for the parking situation. I mean this is pittsburgh, finding good parking is like unicorn-level rare around here. My lil secret tip  if there's absolutely no parking anywhere nearby, um just pull into the BP gas station parking lot right across the street :)  Anyway it's the best pizza around (yes as long as you like the type of sauce they use, that is just personal preference though, I never even ate sauce on pizza until Fiori's..) and price-wise yeah it's a little more expensive than like Dominos but the quality is soo much better, it's worth the cost. I crave this pizza all the time, ahh. Oh and personal preference but for some reason it's not the best cold-the-next-day pizza I've had, but it reheats real well and is still amazing reheated the next day.   The only way it could be better is if they offered delivery (or coupons hint hint) but man it's still worth the drive. Thanks for existing, Fiori's ^_^",

We were given a few options but Fiori's came up the most regularly, so we decided to give it a shot and we are glad we did! Not only is the pizza excellent, but we also tried fried provolone sticks and they were amazing.  The marinara dipping sauce that came with them was also so good, we ordered two containers of it to go so we could just dip bread in it at home.  The staff was very friendly and the place was so busy is was difficult to walk - but even the other patrons were friendly.  It was kind of like a home away from home for the night.  We will definitely visit again whenever we are near.",

The Setting: - Cramped.  Your order at the counter, and folks waiting for carry out (must be most of their business) just kinda stand at the counter, too, so you don't know who is in line to order.  New folks walking in from the street can't get in the door. - The booths are 75% scale, like they're from England or something. - The employees think they are nice, but there is an edge of intolerance here for newbies. - Parking is very difficult - street only, and be prepared to stuff your car in front of a house and hoof it several blocks.",

    "text": "THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!",

I can't explain it, but there is only one other place that I've eaten this type of pizza in the college town where I did my undergrad (Subs n' Suds, Indiana, PA).  It's my most favorite kind.  No toppings, just cheese.  Simple, greasy, simple.  Fiori's pizza is fantastic.  The only complaint I have is parking on that stupid hill - I nearly had a heart attack trying to parallel park up a 45 degree incline.   Service is as fast as it can be, but they seem to work efficiently.  Super nice too.  We eat here as often as we happen to stumble over to the other side of the Liberty Tubes, which isn't often enough.",

I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste.",

The service was okay... To be honest the workers looked pretty miserable but they weren't rude or anything. We tried the cheese sticks, garlic bread, deep fried ravioles, and had the large pizza with sausage.... Okay the cheese they use in the pizza is really odd tasting to me it's just got this bitter taste maybe Parmesan mixed in? They made mozzarella sticks same way I couldn't finish them.... The ravioles were fine... Garlic bread... Ughm nothing special... Bland bread with butter and cheese.... And for the pizza... The cheese and sauce were just weird the sauce was very sweet almost like what a previous comment stated \"sugary\" and I guess with the bland bread and it all kind of evens out in a way...

This pizza is certainly edible, but it is not at the top of my pizza-scale, a place reserved for the Grimaldis and Lombardis of the world (or, more realistically, just the U.S.; Italian pizza, I have heard and trust, is even better).  Fiori's is just underwhelming. I had family from New Jersey visiting and we were looking to grab a few pies after exploring around town. Piccolo Forno was unfortunately closed so I looked to the trusty internet to help me find something near our location that had a good reputation. Fiori's was a popular choice with decent ratings, so we headed over that way. The restaurant space is cramped and only conducive to tables of 4 guests or less in a party. Service was helpful, friendly, and quick. But the pizza just fell flat. The sauce was so sweet, which is not normal outside of this region (not sure what sweet tomato sauce is about, but I don't dig it. There has to be sugar added or something.). Dough was ok but wasn't that perfect medium for the simple yet magical tomato and mozzarella combination that it ought to be. If you are expecting New York style pizza, this is NOT the place for you. Average at best, but better than your fast-food pizza places if you are in a pinch. For me, that will be never.",
