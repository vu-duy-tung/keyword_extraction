The broth tho was tasty and the menu is friendly for vegetarians that I appreciate as there are 3 options our of total of 6-7 ramen dishes.",

The broth is flavorless- possibly just store bought chicken broth in a bowl. The egg was awful and I had a HUGE eggshell in my food. The \"inferno\" \"ramen\" has the spice level of a cup of flour- I still can't figure out why it's called inferno.  And the noodles are hard and have an odd flavor to them.  There are No souls in these bowls.   Honestly I rather have a 'cup of noodles' which they hilariously use as a cup for chopsticks (so embarrassing).   I won't be coming back and will definitely point out to people that this place was the worst ramen I've ever had.",

Everyone was very friendly and patient with us (we got there with 45 minutes to close so we were very appreciative of the warm welcome). The drink selection isn't huge but its a great variety with something something to satisfy everyone's taste (beer selection, wines, and cocktails). I had the curry ramen which was very flavorful and had the perfect spice to it. The music they play is very eclectic and was actually a conversation piece for the two of us as we heard songs we hadn't heard in years so it definitely added to the fun experience. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and was also very sweet about explaining everything on it (I had no clue). Made for a great weekday date night! We will be back soon! :)",

The Bao bread was really good and had interesting flavors. The ramen was a huge portion - we shared it. It was creamy, spicy and delicious. We also ordered sake and wine which were both tasty. The staff was friendly and kind, prices were pretty good.   It was a cozy place with low lights, nice for dates of groups. The high top seating along the window looked really cold. The music was good but had us laughing -- an interesting mix of 90s hip hop, a few other old school songs, and current music.  I took a star off for a few things that were not a huge deal but we would have wanted to go a little smoother. There were several tables open throughout the main dinning area and they sat us directly next to one couple and directly behind another. Our waiter was a bit slow when we wanted to order a glass of wine and again when we wanted our check even though it did not seem super busy.",

Our order was ready extraordinarily quickly. I ordered the Dan Dan ramen with the butter bomb and the vegetarian bao bun.  My partner had the inferno ramen and the meat bao bun.  He ordered a butter bomb in his ramen too but we were pretty sure they forgot to give it to him.  He also felt that the inferno ramen could be slightly spicier as the name leads you to believe.  Overall though we really really liked the food.  The house-made noodles were wonderful.  We really appreciated the thoughtful packaging of the to go order (broth separate from noodles and toppings) so that our food did not get soggy before we got a chance to eat it!  We will definitely be coming back to Ki Ramen!",

Service was fast and what you would expect from a fast turnover restaurant.  CONS: The ramen is not authentic. The broth was salty and lacked the depth and umami you expect from tasty ramen. The pig ear appetizer was too salty.   They had some generic ramen bowls and some more Americanized ramen bowls. Overall, probably the best ramen in Pittsburgh but that's not saying much.  One suggestion would be to get disposable bibs like they have in Japan! :)",

The reason I'm only giving a \"3\" rating is that I was disappointed with the actual food. We shared the vegi Bao and enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of heat and good flavor.   We also shared the  Dan Dan ramen.  Ramen is all about the broth. Even though we ordered the added \"butter bomb\", which supposedly added richness and flavor, I found the broth bland and lacking in the \"mouth -feel\" that you expect. The ramen noodles were just sort of \"there.\" The tofu was rubbery and flavorless, and the additional ingredients (kim chi, scallions, sprouts, and nitamago were skimpy. The dish just didn't cut it. The price, $12 wasn't terrible, but if you added a few of the add ons, Ki Ramen started becoming expensive for what you got.  I'll probably give Ki Ramen another chance because I really love ramen.  But if my next experience isn't significantly better, I'll cross this place off my list",

I don't know if it's because I have had amazing ramen elsewhere and I wanted this place to live up to the expectations I had left those places with? The ramen was just \"ok\". Ramen bar is squirrel hill is slightly better but also slightly pricier (& to me inconsistent). Unfortunately, If you're looking for flavorful broth, you won't find it here. I find that a good broth, I can eat without  having the urge to add things they provide on the tables to it (sauces, spices, ect). This broth was missing something and I couldn't put my finger on it. I know when opening a new restaurant, it can sometimes take a little time to walk before you can run. So we will give it a few months before we come back and give it a second shot.",

I went with my 2 vegan friends, my fish eating fiance, and non picky eater other friends.  My SO ordered the fish ramen special and LOVED it. I did not try it as I am not a huge fish lover. I got the inferno. No extras added to it, I let it come the way the menu described he.  My opinion: Well the soup broth was pretty solid, spicy but not overly so.  The beef was tender and perfect, completely melt in your mouth good. The noodles were house man, but honestly I couldn't tell them from any other noodle I've ever had and seemed just okay.  The vegan/vegetarian soup my friend got tasted okay but I would definitely say it would benefit for a bunch of add ons. He added pepper and msg and chili paste but it didn't really make it much better.  I think they basis is they WANT you to order all the add ons, to increase the cost, and up the flavours. I think the soups would definitely be way better with the add-ons and next time I go there I was test those out.   When in doubt, order the butter bomb with your ramen!!!",

So my review may be biased because of that restaurant.   This place is interesting. It's got a party vibe going with music playing and loud talking.   All cocktails are 10$ each. which feels like a lot.  I tried the tiki punch it was just ok not much flavor honestly. I resorted to a Stella after.   I tried the bao buns. They rotate the meat and the vegetarian options. They offered fried cod as the meat and roasted eggplant as the veggie. I got one of each and the veggie one was amazing! I'd go back for that!  The ramen though is pretty basic. You pick your base and then do add ins to customize...and by customize I mean make it delicious.  I got the shoyun ramen added more mushrooms, Brussels and the butter bomb. It was good but it really adds up doing add ins and I'm not sure the bowl without the add ins would be very satisfying.   I'd say give it a shot if you're open to a new age interpretation of ramen where you really customize your dish but don't expect traditional ramen or bao buns by any means.",

Or just saying hello and waving to their diners at the open bar window down stairs who are slurping and/or cheering for them for their good taste in food. Or waving through the glass on Butler Street at the diners inside. My three year old is a character. He really loves soup. And people who choose to eat soup. We love Ki Ramen.   Personally, I love the ramen bowl customized w a butter bomb, some extra chicken, and my egg held. Ki Ramen like all good Ramen places has you season your own bowl. Seasoning is on the table. It's the diners choice to decide how bland or spicy they prefer their experience. I love a good Ramen place that knows how to follow tradition.   I am also OBSESSED with their buns. My only \"complaint\" is that their isn't multiple flavors of bins daily or that their best buns aren't on the menu each day. They're awesome. If I had a better idea what was expected, I'd plan around the bun to choose when to eat at Ki Ramen. As someone who eats very little meat, and mostly just chicken a couple times a month not knowing the Bun schedule makes choosing Ki Ramen buns for a meal difficult.    BUT- I only mentioned it because those little buns filled with goodies are so delicious and I just crave them all the time. I can't get enough!",

I got the Tiki Punch which was super refreshing and perfect for a summer day. Ramen wise - I got the Inferno which was very yummy with the soy butter ball. Really enjoyed the noodles, broth, egg, beef - the fried chicken skin was delicious but a little heavy for my taste.  Will absolutely return and recommend to all for good in da burgh.",

    "text": "***** Snacks *** Ramen **** Setting +1* for the nitamago (6 min egg) and crispy chicken skin -------- Small little diner/bar that is perhaps slightly overrated at the point.  Love the atmosphere. Best for 2 ppl (Friday night, 2 was a walk-in. 4 was a 25 min wait and 6 was even longer.)  Snacks were fantastic. Grilled Miso Eggplant is a cold appetizer. Fresh and light.  Fried cauliflower is a hot appetizer.  The sauce seems to have peanut butter, so watch out if you are allergic to nuts.  But it was really good and should try.   Ramen was so-so. My Inferno Ramen was hot and salty., and that was it.  I wish the broth can stand out a bit, and less salty. The spiciness was good but with no dimension to it.  Extra point for Nitamago (6 min egg) and crispy chicken skin.  Egg was done to perfection and texture of crispy chicken skin was great.  But they dont bring taste to the ramen.  so it's lacking a bit.   Room for improvement.  Might give it a second chance later.",

We sat on the top level by the kitchen which provided a really cool environment.   We started with the cucumber snack and the fried cauliflower. Bother were outstanding and I'm going to try my best to copy the peanut sauce on the cauliflower on my own. I had the vegetarian curry ramen and added a 6 minute egg and chili paste, which provided the perfect amount of spice. He got the Shio Ramen, which he raved about and loved the crispy pig ears in the dish.   Only complaint was service was lacking in some areas such as not getting water refills, utensils, etc. Food made up for it though so still gets 5 stars in my book. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Okay friends this place got another star because I tried there vegetarian ramen dish and was blown away. It was literally so good that I almost didn't even save half for lunch the next day. I was that much of a hog. The vegetarian ramen dish has squash and mushrooms in it with a very mild broth. The problem was that I really wish that the squash wasn't a big hunk of squash and was maybe in cubed form. Was a little hard to eat with a chopstick since it was literally the side of a squash plopped right in the middle of the bowl but I'm telling you this dish was out of this world. We also went earlier so there wasn't that many people there and it wasn't loud or crowded which really made me feel a lot more comfortable than the last time that I was there. I think for me that coming earlier would be the best bet since the night-time crowd is a little bit too loud and crowded for my delicate constitution. I look forward to getting this dish again and trying maybe some of the appetizers the next time that I venture over one street from where I live to get some Ramen. Yum yum in my tum. I'm serious the vegetarian dish is the way to go. Try it out and tell me what your thoughts are. I want to know if anyone else likes this broth and this dish a lot better than any of the meat dishes that they serve.",

My friends and I went there right after the opening, so food came out a little bit late, but service got faster after a while. Broth was good and light (not as oily). Noodles were a little bit not fully cooked (but still tasted good- maybe it is supposed to be hard?). Portion was good for women guest but I think guys can still eat more. The atmosphere was very clean and tidy and spacious. It was surprising that they charge extra $1 for spicy sauce. However they also offer spice powders and msg (funny how they laid it out there). Overall it is decent restaurant. I might visit once again in near future.",

The fried cauliflower appetizer was very unassuming but awesome...couldn't stop eating it.  My daughter got the ramen with the pig ears (which she didn't like) so I had an added bonus to my ramen!!!

Perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough, and fantastic mix of textures (crispy chicken, firm-white-gooey-yolk boiled egg, perfectly cooked noodles). I know ramen broth is sorta considered unhealthy, but I couldn't stop myself from drinking every last drop.  Beer selection is highly curated; it's not a large selection (maybe 10 different choices), but they're all fantastic. Dogfish Head sour I got was one of the best I've had.  First visit was fantastic. Second visit, I found my ramen to be a little lacking in seasoning, and I had to add quite a bit of the MSG and ramen pepper provided on the table to bring the Unami factor up. This one was done perfectly and I didn't add a drop of anything to it.  It's a small selection compared to a couple of the other ramen shops in town, but what they have, they execute well. Hope they stick around for the long haul.",

We started with the fried cauliflower - cauliflower was not greasy, crunchy yet delicate, and topped with an assortment of sauces and bonito flakes.  The highlight - the vegetarian curry ramen. The broth was legitimately slurp-able. Delicate yet satisfying, the lemongrass and coconut broth was outstanding. The chicken ramen was also quite good - and the chicken was perfectly cooked.  Not a fan of ramen eggs? I'm definitely not, so was about to forego the egg on top of the chicken ramen.  Im very happy that I didn't make that mistake - the egg was outstanding. It was more of a delicately sous vide egg - which was satisfying and enjoyable.  Along with the usual togarashi, you can top your ramen with MSG (no joke) and a homemade combination of ground pepper - which I encourage you to try.",

They are open 5p-12a Monday through Saturday, have a full bar, and a \"limited menu\". To be honest the menu a it stands now was sufficient choice and variety for me and I was happy with all the options. They have a variety of ramen bowls you can customize with add ons to elevate the bowl to an even higher level of flavor. One of which is the butter bomb which I did not get to try but definitely have my eye on for my next visit.   This was my first time here and I got the Shio ramen. It came with crispy pig ears, pork belly, scallions, sesame seeds, and a soft boiled egg. The noodles were a little under cooked for my liking in a ramen bowl but the flavor was amazing. I appreciate that they make their own hand pulled noodles and you can tell by the freshness and flavor. I also tried the Inferno ramen. I was a little less impressed with the flavor but a beef bowl isn't usually my go to anyways so I expected this. I also tried the Ti-Ki punch that had vodka, hibiscus, and elderflower and am still drooling over this refreshing and light drink. The size of the draft beer was a little smaller than what I was expecting but also very delicious.   Overall I think it's a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. I'll be recommending this place to all my friends who still live here and definitely be back to try the shoyu ramen as soon as I'm back in town!",

This place has far exceeded my expectations.    Their menu is seasonal.  Everything is fresh.  Typically, they have a rotating bao bun, but during the winter months they switch to having the same few selections all the time.  That being said, the General Tso Tofu Bao is wonderful.  During the summer, they had a chilled ramen that was so good I think I got it at least once a week! The inferno ramen is super spicy and great for cold winter months.  Their menu accommodates vegetarians and meat eaters alike.   I really enjoy the Take It Easy bar in the back.  In the summer months they open up the garage door and you can sit to watch traffic.  It's right next to a decently busy intersection, so you get some good entertainment.",

Even though the order was wrong, the meat bao was still good!   I had the inferno ramen which was juuuust enough spice to not leave the place with steam coming from my mouth and ears. I would say spice level sits at about a 5 or 6 out of 10 on that dish. All in all I would return and try other things. I think the food and overall ambiance and location is great!",

I have been to some of the best ramen bars in NYC, Philly, and DC so I am not really that surprised that Ki Ramen could not compare. The noodles did not seem very fresh and the meat had too much fat to the point were I could not eat most of it. Our waiter was very friendly and the decor is very nice. Maybe some of their other dishes are better but I don't know if i'll ever come back to find out.",

I showed up at a great time, around 3pm after the lunch rush and before the dinner crowd. Initially I planned to do take out, but the bartender, host, and servers were so friendly that I took a window seat.   The menu had few chef-created options, but a ton of add-ons. I picked the inferno ramen. My ramen came quickly, piping hot and so spicy it cleared my sinuses :) The fried chicken skin was crispy and savory.  The flavor was multilayered and changed based on the combination of meat/veggies/noodles in the spoon. The beef was so tender and had a good amount of fat attached. I was halfway done with the broth before realizing I had barely touched the noodles. I briefly panicked about being too full to finish my bowl, but my server assured me that the ramen reheats just as deliciously. She recommended that I swirl the hot geyser egg after reheating to send eggy bits everywhere. It was just as good the first time!  I can't wait to visit Ki Ramen again. Next time I'll order double beef and extra fried chicken skin.",

This was my first time eating out at any ramen establishment but the menu was straightforward enough that I was easily able to pick an app and a main dish. I got the fried cauliflower and the Dan Dan noodles (~$17).   I waited inside and the place was bustling the entire time, though, it was not overly noisy, which is good. It was happy and fun yet light and casual.   My food was ready in no time! When I got home, the cauliflower was a bit too greasy, and yes I realize it was fried! The noodles were good but tasted much better after I added some sriracha and cilantro.   All in all it was a pleasant experience. Would go back and see if I can bump it up from 3.5 to a 4 star rating.",

I started with the beet Kim chi because I love beets and man, was that delicious! I ordered the shoyu ramen bowl and my husband got the inferno bowl. The bowls were delicious but we did wish there was more ramen to soak up the rest of the broth. No complaints though, we both loved them and next time if we're real hungry we'll get extra noodles. We also finished with the donut bao's and I could have eaten like 5 of those, they were so good! Ki Ramen also carries local brews and cider which is always a nice thing to see, plus we had great service. We will most definitely be back!!",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had been looking forward to trying Ki Ramen even since we heard of its addition in Lawrenceville.  Whenever my wife and I arrived the place was packed and they told us that it would take 15-20 minutes before our table would be ready.  They took down our number which was nice since there wasn't really anywhere to wait in the restaurant and we were free to roam around Lawrenceville.  Around 15 minutes later my phone rang and we headed back and were seated at a two top in the main dining restaurant.  Ki Ramen consists of large dining room, a loft area and then what looked to be a downstairs basement all with seating.  It was rather sparsely decorated with huge open walls with only lights on them.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the cavalfiore (fried cauliflower) and then I also went with the meat bao which was pork on this day.  Then for our entrees I went with the inferno ramen while my wife went with the miso ramen.  Our cavalfiore came out first as a huge chunk of cauliflower.  I don't know if I would have called it fried but it definitely tasted pretty good, especially the crunchy sesame paste (I originally thought it was peanut butter but a fellow Yelper corrected me and so I updated this to reflect that) which gave the cauliflower some sweetness as well as texture.  Whenever we were about half way through that the rest of our meal came out.  I ended up trying the bao first and thought it was alright.  It's bun reminded me of the outside of a Yorkshire pudding while the pork and vegetables inside were good.  Thankfully my ramen was a whole lot better.  I enjoyed the beef, cabbage and onsen egg (sous vide) from my dish but the real star was the broth.  It was flavorful and spicy giving everything that it touched a little heat without going too far over the top.  The only downfall from my dish was the crispy chicken skin which was served half submerged in my broth.  So while half of it was nice and crispy, the other half was soggy and defeated the purpose of even having it.   The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  While I didn't leave the restaurant full and ended up having a snack shortly after getting home, I did really enjoy both the cavalfiore and inferno ramen.",

The place is very nice, clean and trendy and we walked right in and got a table. Prices were reasonable. Food was pretty good but definitely geared towards the trendy ramen side. We ultimately enjoyed our meals but not my favorite place. One standout critique is that the soup was just way too salty, seemingly both the broth and the noodles. It killed the experience for me a bit. The noodles had great texture though, and the kim chi and soft boiled eggs were standouts for sure. We also ordered the purple yam gyoza which was excellent. Service was great, very friendly. The fried chicken that came in the soup was sort of Korean style, sweet with thick breading which made it difficult to eat. One of the larger pieces was so fatty it was impossible to eat. They do offer a great blend of spicy additives including house made shakers, which I was into (again, very salt based though). It was a quick trip, tasty and hit the spot, but the overall experience just missed a little for me. It lacked a soulful authenticity that is essential with this soup. It is new and again it was probably our one and only meal there, so I can't say much. Worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood and craving a bowl of noodle soup.",

I absolutely hate writing negative reviews, but this was just so disappointing. I'm not a terribly picky eater and can usually enjoy anything, and I hate to say it, but it's probably the worst food I've eaten in years.  Decided to try it. The wait staff was great, but the food was awful; bf's noodles were chewy, some of the pork was decent, but cut too big and other parts were firm and stringy, \"crispy pig ears\" were chewy.  I was concerned when I saw how fast the food came out because to make good ramen and eggs usually takes a bit. I am totally happy and willing to wait for good ramen.  Their bao buns are $6 for 1 bun(most places are 2 for $6 and better) and the bread was crisp and firmer instead of your typical soft ones. It was good, but not what I want when I'm looking for a bao bun.  Technique was just off on everything and additionally the food made both me and my bf feel sick, and I have an iron stomach. I never don't finish my food regardless of how much I dislike it, but I couldn't even get halfway through.  So sad to write this, but wish I had seen a review like this before trying it.  Additionally their seating rules are really odd. They had plenty of seating available, but we had to wait for a 2 seater. I get it if it's busier,but there were tons of empty spots. Really weird.  Will stick to Yuzu Kitchen from now on. If you're looking for good ramen and bao buns, they're the best I've found in Pitt so far.",

I ordered the Shio Ramen which had pork belly, crispy friend pork ears, scallions, and soft boiled egg. The noodles were perfect and the broth had a great flavor. I can absolutely see myself coming here regularly for some ramen during the colder months. I think it will hit the spot.  We ordered draft beers. They were smaller than I expected, but we also ordered a 9.7% beer, so that's probably fine!  The staff are efficient and friendly.

This is subpar ramen and you shouldn't spend your money here.  A couple of points to consider: 1. Their drinks are OVER PRICED! A friend ordered a beer and it was a 10oz glass for $6! Do these people know their customer base? 2. They were out of meat baos and other small items on their menu at 5pm on a Wednesday. Really? 3. They offer you 1 bao for $6. If that isn't robbery I don't know what is.  4. They won't seat you until all in the party are there. It's a stupid rule regardless of the place doing it. This place applies that rule even though the restaurant was nearly empty. I questioned them on this and got some response where they assumed I was going to be with people that were always late. 5. Our waitress was fake af. Saw right through her faux positive attitude. 6. I live in NYC and the ramen there is pretty epic. One item that they have as an add on in NYC restaurants is corn, a basic item to add to ramen. My fake af waitress told me that they took it off the menu because it wasn't fresh any more. Really? They draw the line at fresh corn? Give me a break. 7. It was 20 degrees that night and everytime someone came through the front door the whole front seating area was bathed in cold frigid air. How about putting up a curtain to block that? They're lack of attention to detail is pathetic.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they paid for my next meal. It's not good. I'm not sure of the other Pittsburgh ramen places, but if this is the best Pittsburghers are seriously missing out on respectable ramen.  Oh, and plus, 3 of the people in my party felt ill after their meal, and I was left still hungry.  In summary, go somewhere else. If you think this is good ramen, your horizons need to be expanded.",

    "text": "We rolled through at around 10 pm on August 12th to check out the soft opening, and were very pleased. We didn't try any of the appetizers, though we would have liked to try the kim chi (they were out). We sat upstairs at the bar facing the kitchen and saw several plates of the fried cauliflower go out, and it looked quite tasty.  The limited menu ended up being just fine, as we thought both the Shoyu Ramen and Shio Ramen sounded great. We both added chili paste for $1, as lovers of all things spicy. Both were fantastic, and the homemade noodles really stood out. They have a bit more of a bite to them than your usual ramen noodle, which I enjoyed, though they didn't soak up the broth as much. Nicely sized portions with plenty of ingredients mingling in the bowls. I've already seen even more appetizing items have been added to the full menu, so it will be nice to check the place out again once the usual Pittsburgh wintry winds come through.  Service left a little to be desired that night, and the noodles took longer than we were expecting. The waitress seemed eager to leave for the night and we felt rushed to order and finish eating. It wasn't quite the end of the night yet, with a couple hours left, but hopefully some of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant matures.",

Having lived in Korea and visited many parts of Japan, I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the ramen and ingredients used in our meal. First, the chasu wasn't real chasu. It was just steamed or boiled pork. Second, the noodles which should be the most important part of the ramen was sub quality and something they would never serve in Japan, not even at the $2 ramen stands.  Lastly, my wife's ramen lacked enough broth to cover the noodles, so we asked for more. Little did we know until the check had arrived, we were charged for the broth although it should have been part of the ramen in the first place.   It isn't that I have high standards, I don't think many costumers coming to Ki Ramen has any idea what they should expect.",

The broth had some heat but it certainly wasn't unbearable. The ramen bowl was full of perfectly aldente noodles, tender brisket, a deliciously poached egg, and soft cabbage. The pork bun was delicious as well. It was sweet and the meat was tender and Smokey. The bun was also very palatable, although I do prefer a more sticky steamed bun than fried.  I really liked the fact that they do not cook with MSG, but have it in a shaker at the table if you so wish to add some Unami to your dish.   Service was great, very attentive and knowledgeable waitress.   Will certainly be back again.",

The sun pouring in through the floor to ceiling windows brightens the front room, but it was also very warm and blinding bright.   The Shoyu ramen had a very nice well rounded flavor, and not salty at all. My least favorite part of this particular ramen was the mushroom. The mushroom looked interesting, but the texture was unappealing to this reviewer. Perhaps if it was sliced and added. Very filling!  The Interno ramen definitely lives up to its name! Very spicy, and while I enjoy spicy foods this had a nice level of heat, but it was just above my tolerance to enjoy. A few spoonfuls of this broth into the shoyu would have been amazing!  There's three different seasonings on the table including MSG, which is NOT used in any of the dishes but some diners choose to add.   The bao bun is definitely worth trying.The options change weekly. The meat one for the day had pork, kimchi, and hoisin which was a delicious pairing!",

I ordered the inferno ramen with no substitutes and the spring roll.  The spring roll was SUPER tasty and the mustard dipping sauce was bomb. My bowl came quickly and was tasty, but was not very spicy. My husband's bowl (can't remember the name) had candied pig ears that were tasty, and a soft boiled egg that was really good.

He seemed very irritated to be working, he used one word responses, he forgot my friend's beer, and he hurriedly told us the specials before we had even sat down.

I've only ever had one ramen experience in the past and it left me very disappointed. After hearing my coworker say he was eating here multiple times a week I thought for sure this had to be amazing. While I won't say it was a disappointment I certainly wasn't blown away either.  I started my meal with a order of the spicy cucumbers. Now those blew me away for sure! I could have ordered another order for myself. The $4 price point also wasn't bad. I was a little disappointed in the price point for the Bao Buns. They weren't that big and they were $6 for just one. My friend ended up getting that days vegetarian option and she did say that it was really good.   Ramen wise I went with the Dan Dan ramen. Since this was basically my first time having ramen I opted to not add anything to my bowl. All in all the bowl was fairly good. I really liked the kim chi mixed in and every bite that had kim chi was by far the best bite. I'm a huge tofu fan but sadly this tofu fell short of expectations. It was a little too tough for me and it was relatively flavorless in my opinion.   With all of that being said, I would like to give Ki Ramen another try and try another one of the ramen bowls. If you haven't checked it out yet you should give it a try!",

    "text": "Stopped by on a rainy day for a steaming bowl of noodle soup. Unfortunately the temperature was lukewarm at best. Overall a very mediocre but passable ramen shop. The one nice thing is that they don't cook with MSG and leave it on the side for you to add at your discretion.   Shoyou ramen - very greasy. I'm not sure if the broth itself was already greasy or if it was just soaking off of the fried chicken. Noodles were on the hard and chewy side and they were kind of clumped together at the bottom. Chicken tasted okay.   Inferno ramen - also a layer of grease covering the soup. Brisket was made well and was very flavorful. The spice level really is pretty mild. Again, noodle texture isn't what I'm used to.   Overall flavor 3/5, but the egg was cooked well. The grease on top doesn't leave you feeling the best after eating it. Would try another flavor, but definitely wouldn't be a go to place in the area.",

Our server left in the middle of things without telling us, and while the bartender took over without issue, if I'd known who was taking care of us some of the other issues might have been addressed.  I was really sad to see the fried cauliflower not on the menu anymore.  Hopefully it was a sourcing issue and word is it might be coming back, but still a huge disappointment.  I ordered an appetizer of fried pig ears and normally they melt in your mouth.  This  time they were barely edible.  I figured if I dumped them in my ramen that they'd soften up enough, but it didn't help, and I could  no longer send them back since they were now in my food.  The ramen iself... I got the coconut curry flavour to try something different.  The broth is amazing.  The broth with anything else (noodles, egg, etc) is forgettable.  It's such a delicate, subtle flavour that it's entirely overpowered by any single other ingredient.  The result was ramen that was amazingly bland.  The portions were great, as always.  The setting was perfect.  The drinks were good.  I just feel like Ki Ramen is slowly succumbing to corner cutting.  Not sure if I can justify dropping seventy dollars on okay ramen.",

They are so accommodating for vegetarians, vegans and those gluten-free as well. All menu items clearly marked with a \"V\" and most vegetarian items are able to be made vegan. More recently they've even expanded the offerings and now have a vegan kimchi option, and the daily veggie bao bun is vegan friendly 99% of the time. Love dining here with a large group in the main dining area, or just popping in the back bar area for a late night bite. The staff truly is so kind and welcoming, always willing to answer any questions, accommodate for any dietary needs, and offer suggestions on what they recommend. They also have an extensive drink menu including local beer on draft and in cans, traditional Japanese-style beers, warm sake, specialty cocktails, and a great wine selection as well. Ramen is always served piping hot and is quite the generous portion, appetizers may not be necessary but everything is so darn good, it's hard to pass up a starter. Lately this has been my go-to dinner spot to bring out of town guests, and it is always a huge hit!",

We sat at the bar by the window to indulge in more people watching.  It took a bit of time to actually be waited on. Once the waitress took our order, it took even longer to get our food. We later found out that they had a busier than expected lunch rush and ran out of noodles! Over all, it was worth the wait.  We ordered the fried cauliflower, crispy pig ears, and sho yu ramen. I highly suggest the two appetizers. They are unique, tasty, and only $4 each. The ramen was good! But I wanted something more from it. Next time I'll order something spicy or add some more fixins.  4 stars because service was molasses! We'll be back though!",

I ordered a Shio Ramen with chashu, crispy pig ear, nitamago (egg), scallions, sesame seeds + butter bomb + bean sprouts. MMM... I can't compare this to other ramen restaurants around Pittsburgh. I don't want to compare the Pittsburgh food scene to Los Angeles, Boston, or New York's food scene because it's like comparing apples to oranges.  So this Shio Ramen: 1) Not as flavorful as I expected, which was surprising even with the butter bomb. My standard for ramen is that it should not make me feel gross and it's gotta have a personality. I ate here 2 days ago and I cannot remember the taste of the broth. 2) The crispy pig ear was a surprise because I haven't seen it in any other ramen bowls before. Not bad.  I also got the red bean ice cream bao (sandwich) and oh no. If you really like sweet things, you may enjoy this because they dip it in this matcha sugar. I was expecting a twist on a regular soft bao with red bean ice cream, but the whole thing was frozen and dipped in sugar.  Ki Ramen. Interesting concept but ended up not my thing.",

    "text": "My friend and I were excited for the soft opening of Ki Ramen! Since it was a soft opening, their menu was limited with 3 different types of ramen and some add ons. I went with the vegetarian curry ramen, which had tamarind, scallion, coconut milk, cabbage, cauliflower, wakame and miso. I added an onsen egg and porcini-chili butter bomb. My friend had the shoyu ramen, which consisted of soy braised chicken, scallion, kikurage, onsen egg and cabbage. The ramen prices were reasonable with mine being $11 and then the add ons were each $2.    Our only complaint was that the wait was kind of long. Since there were only three items on the menu, we did not expect the wait to be so long. We were seated on the upper level, where the kitchen was located. There is a main level where you walk in and then a lower level, so there is plenty of seating!   When the food finally came, we were very satisfied. My vegetarian curry broth was so flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The onsen egg was also a nice addition with the yolk adding a lot of flavor to the broth. It was a nice change from the traditional soft boiled egg. My friend also was very pleased with her shoyu ramen. She said her broth was very tasty and it was one of the best ramens she has had.   I look forward to coming back and trying their full menu! An excellent collaboration between two great chefs of Pittsburgh.",

Although this could be a fun place to grab dinner with friends, the spacing is a bit small, and the dishes (listed below) were not memorable.  Ambiance: A bit loud, I wouldn't say it's the best place to get to know someone on a dinner date. Be prepared to ask your date to repeat him/herself several times while others in very close proximity evesdrops on your conversations.  Service: Receptionists are very nice and accommodating. Our server was very nice. Strangely, he had us waiting at least 20 minutes (I stopped counting) for our check.  Food: -Kimchi: overall good textures for kimchi, not too soggy but had some crunch to the vegetables. Unfortunately, my date and I (and those eavesdropping) believed that they were fermented too long and consequently tasted way too sour, so beware this kimchi is not for the faint-hearted.  -we shared a large, hearty bowl of shio ramen. The broth was very light, no charsiu typical of more traditional ramen. We had fried pork ears on top, which added a nice savory flavor and crunchy texture to complement the noodles. However, I wouldn't call this ramen but rather an Asian-inspired bowl of noodles, which was still satiating.  Overall a restaurant to go to experience a lively, hip crowd over an Asian-inspired meal. However, I would not recommend for those interested in more traditional tasting ramen but rather prioritize an experience or a night out with friends.",

I never had them before because they're just noodles that college kids buy at the dollar store . So what could be so exciting about noodles....? I'm still asking that question today...  My server helped me decide on the Inferno Ramen because it was spicy and had more flavor. They also have extra spices that you can add to the soup.   The restaurant is nice with a bar and the staff is friendly.  HERE IS MY TAKE......  1. My SOUP had a ladle in it too big to eat from. WHY??? 2. There were chopsticks on the table... WHY IN THE HELL would you try eating SOUP with CHOPSTICKS??? 3. I tried the chopsticks but the noodles were too long and I didn't get any broth??? 4. I dropped my noodles and meat and it splashed on me which resulted in others snickering at me! WHY??? 5. I had to stop and cut the ingredients with a knife. WHO??? 6. I tried being traditional but just asked for a soup spoon which cut down on the stress of eating this annoyingly engineered soup. WHERE? 7. I guess you hurry up and grab the noodles and slurp on them before the broth drains...WHAT??? 8. I got really full and couldn't eat dessert and it made me sleepy. WHEN??? 9. It's just soup with home made wiggly dollar store noodles, nothing to lose control over. It did have good spicy meat flavor and the meat was tender.  All in all I just don't give a hoot about ramen noodles but if you do give a hoot this is a good place to hoot in.",

I grew up eating spicy food, but even this made me sweat a bit. The taste of the ramen wasn't terrific. I'd say it's pretty average, but it wasn't bad. There are definitely better ramen places in Pittsburgh though, but this place has its perks, such as really friendly service and a chill ambience.   What I will say though, is that they're interesting with toppings. I had fried chicken skin in my ramen, and while it didn't taste good, it was definitely innovative. If you come here, I would recommend the cauliflower appetizer. That was one of the best cauliflower dishes I've ever had! However, the consensus among my friends and I was that the ramen was at best a 3.5/5.   I would probably not come here again, but if I do, I wouldn't mind too much. It's decent - just not great compared to other ramen in Pittsburgh.",

They do not accept reservations and I have to say turnover at this restaurant is rather slow for a ramen bar. Drinks were reasonably priced (a pint of Sapporo for $5) and the service was excellent. The gentleman who seated us (Jeff) did a fantastic job welcoming us to the restaurant and highlighted the specials on the menu.   I think this restaurant is in a great location and I like that they have a straightforward and edited menu, although I can't really get behind all the daring combinations of soups that they have created. It is simply challenging for me as a ramen purist. However, the bowl that I had, although I wouldn't call it ramen, tasted good. Lastly, I am slightly insulted that they would charge $13 for a bowl of ramen in Pittsburgh.",

There's apparently a bar connected to this place and I'm assuming that's where they get their booze from. I got the karragge ramen(def butchered the spelling) it was good. Tbh the only good thing was the fact that the noodles are made fresh in house the ramen lacked flavor even the chicken had no Flavor I ended up adding all kinds of goodies to My ramen (for a fee of course) and it still lacked flavor. I got the cha shu bao for an app and that was freaking amazing a buddy got the tofu bao which was honestly better tasting than the cha shu. I can't remember the name of the drink I got but it had whiskey and turmeric with cloves weird mix but the drink was delicious (the server recommended it) all in all if you want to try some ramen I'd check it out just for the fresh ramen. Another thing is they don't have a large selection of ramen so your options are pretty limited. All in all a decent spot for us ramen lovers",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am Asian-American (although not Japanese), and from California. This what I'm comparing Ki Ramen to.  I got there for lunch and order the Shio Ramen since I wanted meat. I substituted the egg for the soft boiled one and added enoki mushroom since there didn't seem to many vegetables in the dish. The service was good and the ambiance is nice. The crispy pig ear was the best part of the dish. The meat was super fatty, but I like fatty meat.  The mushrooms and egg didn't add much value as the soup was so salty. Although the bowl had a lot of flavor, it was distracting with the salt. It's been 5+ hours and it's still all I can taste after downing a bunch of water: They also charge you for chili, which I should have been more aware of. Most places don't charge me for that.  At the end of the day, $16 before tip is very expensive for medium-quality and very very salty ramen.",

We were greeted by the hostess and sat right down at a two seater.   We had looked over the menu a little bit before we came here so we sort of knew what we wanted.  Our waitress was nice and she came over to ask us if we had ever been here before and if we would like her to explain the menu.  We let her and she did a good job explaining everything to us.   We ordered their Meat Bao bun that had Oyster in it to start us off.  For our main dish I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and my wife got the Inferno Ramen.   Our Bao came out within 10 minutes.  It looked good. Our waitress said that if we were sharing it they would cut it in half for us but they didn't but  no big deal we cut it and shared the bun.  The actually bun was good but we felt that it needed more filling.  It was a lot more bun and less Oyster.  It was good but we have tasted better.   Our Ramen came out about ten minutes later.  Our dishes looked really good and we were hungry.  My wife liked her dish and you can read her review on her Ramen.  My Ramen was good but not great.  The noodles were really good.  The broth warmed us up and was good but I felt it needed a little more salt or something to bring out more the flavors in my Ramen.  I'd give it a six out of ten.  I like the vegetable in my Ramen but the chicken looked a little funny to me and tasted funny too.  The Ramen filled me up and I was satisfied.  Not the best Ramen and maybe a little over priced but if your in the area and it's cold out this is a good spot to try out.",

    "text": "Perhaps I waited too long to come here or maybe it was an off day, but I wasn't impressed with what I was expecting to be an exciting evening experience!  First off, the service was mediocre and suuuper slow. We ordered a bao and two bowls of ramen, one of them the cold style and it took forever. Don't know why, the restaurant was only half full. Ramen is supposed to be fast. Like a couple minutes max! I mean the broth is done, the noodles are either in a constant rotation or take no time at all, and the it's the toppings.  But let's get to the food. The bao we had was a \"pulled pork\" one. The traditional braised belly was not available. Well I can tell you that the pulled pork tasted like crockpot pork with some bbq sauce on it. It had no Asian flavor profile and was just odd. The texture of the pork was mushy.   Finally, after a long wait, the ramen. We ordered a cold ramen and the curry ramen. First off the curry ramen was a mistake. Only order in an emergency if you're a vegetarian. Neither of us are, so this was our mistake. We just like curry style Ramen. (For comparison order the Tan Tan Men in Sq. Hill. It's awesome!) This was so bland and boring with a one dimensional hit of curry. The noodles were under seasoned. Of course, the noodles in the cold ramen were under seasoned as well. I had hoped for a better dish because of the dashi base. But the cold ramen was disappointing as well. Not sure how a dashi base can result in a dish with zero umami considering the origins of the word but it happened.   Because of all the above this place gets three stars, and that's being generous. The reason why it's not two is because we didn't try the standard shio bowl of ramen. That was our mistake. Maybe it's spectacular?!",

The server there was friendly, but there were a couple of misses in the service.  The biggest one was the order of delivery.  I wasn't in the mood for ramen, so I ordered a selection of appetizers as my meal.  My companion did a bowl of ramen.  All of my food came out a good 15 minutes before her ramen.  The server didn't really seem to care or notice this faux pas.    As for the food, it was hit and miss.  I got both bao buns - the meat and veg.  They were good, but not great and a little small for the $6 each price tag.  The gyoza were really good, but my second one was apparently not sealed right and was full of boiling hot oil.   The spring roll itself was good and filling, but the sauce was bland.   Overall, I just wasn't wowed.     All in all, there are better places to get a bowl of ramen. The smell and the service didn't make me want to return.",

My biggest complaint is I wish they had a build your own ramen. Start with a veggie or meat base and pick your ad ins. That would have been ideal for me.   As far as the food goes, the beet Kim Chi was so much better than I thought it was going to be. And the pork Bao, was out of this world! The pork melted like it was butter and the Mayo I could eat on anything. My ramen was good, I did not love the onsen egg and wish it was the nitamago instead. The onsen egg didn't really add anything to it, in my opinion, it just melted into the bottom. We added some of our beet Kim Chi into our bowls and it added a really great flavor. We will definitely be back and I hope to try the dessert bao next time!",

The majority of the ramen is made with a mix of pork broth and chicken broth so my options were only 3 ramen bowls. I went with the dan dan. It had a little heat to it since there was kimchi in the soup. I didn't care for the egg in it though. The noodles could be cooked a little more too. My table started with the fried cauliflower.

Two downsides: my ramen bowl was supposed to come with a sous vide egg, but it was severely overcooked which left me scratching my head. Not for fear of eating it, I just don't typically want to eat uncooked egg. I also had a pineapple rum cocktail, which was just rum with a pineapple ice cube. Clever, but not a cocktail.",

I'm pretty into ramen and try to find various takes when traveling or at home. This was my first trip to Ki Ramen and I ordered the Shoyu ramen, feeling chicken broth would cure this crazy spring weather. The broth is tasty--good flavors. Ramen noddles itself are fine, a bit harder than I like and a bit bland. As for the toppings, the cabbage could have been softened and the onsen egg was a little too soft for my taste. (It's softer than a soft-boiled egg.) There are some spice and flavor seasoning on the table (chilli pepper, black peppercorn, and MSG), but nothing that is real heat. I suspect that the red heat that I'm accustomed to with ramen is an extra topping option that I saw on the menu for $1.   The size of the bowl is sufficient and filling. Not big enough to have leftovers. It's a good spot and service was really great. I might try other items like the sides and baos next time.",

    "text": "This is one of those reviews that I really wish I could give 3.5 stars. Ki Ramen has great potential, but it just doesn't quite hit the right flavor notes to make this a 4+ star experience. I really enjoyed the ambiance, the service was great, and my cocktail was delicious, but the food is just average. We started with the fried Cauliflower which was texturally perfect, but there was nothing flavor wise that really made it pop. This was also the theme with the ramen that we had, chicken and inferno, it was all there except for the flavor to really set the dish apart, there just aren't enough layers to really get you excited for that next bite. I will most likely come here again, but I don't see this establishment as anything more than a great place to meet with some friends for a cocktail. Hopefully I'm wrong, but from my experience I can name a dozen or so better places to grab a bite in Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, but it all really fell short. I started with the cucumber and cauliflower appetizers. The cucumber tasted just like pickles and didn't have the right kick to it. The cauliflower was one huge breaded cauliflower. The peanut sauce on the bottom was lacking and it was very difficult to cut up with just chopsticks. I got the shio ramen, which had some tasty ingredients (crispy pig ears, ramen egg), but the broth was very bland and the pork belly was not great.  The specialty drinks could use some work - tried the fig cocktail and rose/vodka drink and both didn't wow me.  I will give it another try in a few weeks, and hopefully the food will improve.",

We  sat in the main dining area which was nicely decorated with Asian-style wood paneling. The menu has approximately six different ramen options along with add-ons for the ramen, snacks and side dishes. We started with the fried cauliflower which was crispy and well flavored. I had the Dan Dan ramen for my main course which was also amazing. I decided to add some chili paste to increase the spice and didn't find it overpowering. The dish itself had kimchi and bits of tofu in it as well as a soft boiled egg. The noodles were fresh and the broth was very savory. Service was attentive and prompt throughout our meal. Overall, very happy with the experience and would definitely go again.",

    "text": "A few of us got together on a Wednesday night to check out the new noodle place. There were no tables available when we arrived so we decided to sit at the high tops along the wall looking at the street. Great people watching spot as long as you're ok with people from the street watching you eat as well! I got the miso eggplant appetizer to share which when it came out looked like a slug on a plate but was actually quite delicious. For the main dish I got the vegetarian curry but I added the chili paste to add a little spice. Again this was very good and adding the chili really gave it that extra kick it needed. The meal was good and I'd recommend people to definitely try. My only and biggest complaint was the service. Our waitress was not friendly, probably very busy, but was pretty much like what do you want and that was it. I had to practically wave her down to get a second drink which didn't arrive until she came over when we were finished and noticed I still hadn't received my drink. I mentioned I didn't want it unless it was already made and she gave it to me after we received our checks. I'm not asking for a free drink but if you're going to give it to me after I'm finished when I ordered it half way through the meal something would have been appreciated. Overall food was good, service something to be desired.",

I had Ki Ramen at their pop up before their location opened and thought it was good. My meal here left much to be desired. The curry ramen was bland (even with chili paste) and I thought the food was overpriced. $15 for a vegetarian noodle bowl seems a bit much. The snacks were marginally more exciting, we ordered the chicken skin and cauliflower which were fine but not great. All around I was unimpressed, and the service was terribly mediocre. Our server came over TOO often to ask random questions when it was obvious that we were deep in conversation.  We were rushed out even though it was 9 pm on Wednesday night and there were available tables all around us.  I felt that Ki Ramen's food was trying to be like Grit & Grace's menu (I miss Grit & Grace!)... but was no where near as good.   If I eat here again, it will not have been my suggestion.",

Waitress was lovely, food (as always) was delicious, and free street parking after 6pm was easy to find.   We ordered the kimchi fried rice as an starter for our table of 4, and we each got the Signature Meat ramen. I swapped out the meatballs for extra noodles and the chili paste for the inferno oil. Strongly recommend! While it took a while for our food to come out despite it not being busy, every other time I've come has been pleasant so not much to complain!",

We decided to check out Ki Ramen cause it was close to where we were! The cartoon artwork on the wall was cute.. also explains what all the add ons are in case you're new to ramen! Server was quick and we got our food in good time!  *Edamame - Exactly what you would expect with lots of salt! My tongue was feeling it after eating so many of them! 3/5  *Crispy Wontons - Deep Fried dumplings. Good flavors, crispy on the outside, served super hot. The filling was pork and heavy on ginger but I liked them! The sauce didn't add much to the dumpling! 4/5  *Kimchi Fried Rice - All veggies! We liked the flavor of this dish the best! Good mix of veggies - kimchi, onion, bean sprouts and a runny egg to mix in! 5/5  *Signature Meat Ramen - I got my dish and saw all the red chili and was thinking 'oh no'! I don't want it super spicy. But it wasn't! I also tasted the crispy pig ears and thought it was super salty.. Mix it all in. The pig ears were delish after it's soaked in the broth a bit! Added a crunch and another texture to the ramen! The noodles were cooked perfect! I liked the 'bite' it had! Now the broth was ok, a bit salty and a bit too greasy, maybe cause of the meats and the butter bomb. I loved the woodear mushrooms.. didn't like the large bean sprouts so much. The chashu was fatty and I actually hated the meatballs - I didn't think it worked well with the flavors of the broth. The meatballs actually tasted Italian. The egg though, was spot on! Overall, it was just ok ramen.. creative, untraditional, and just a bit too much going on. 3/5  I didn't get to try any of the other ramens but I did taste the Spicy Tonkotsu broth. A bit on the bland side after the Signature Meat. I think the consensus across the board was that we liked the Kimchi Fried Rice over all the ramens. Even though the noodles were good, we all wished the broth and toppings were better! Not horrible, just not our favorite.",

Our friends who sat on the outside of the table had to keep moving in when others would walk by.  I ordered the SHOYU RAMEN and it was decent but the broth was salty and the noodles were on the chewier side. I left feeling more bloated than full. And considering the price, I don't think it was worth. However, the service was pleasantly good! Not sure if I would recommend coming here when there are other ramen places that are more affordable and less salty.   tldr; food 3/5 service 4/5 interior 3/5",

It was a very generous serving for two people - this would easily feed 4-5 people as an appetizer/snack.  I got the Spicy Miso Ramen.. I am not too much a fan of Brussels sprouts but I figured if I didn't like them I'd eat around them. They soaked up a ton of flavor and tasted just like a veggie eggroll! Our waiter also offered to bring the chili paste & inferno oil on the side since I was apprehensive about the spiciness. The inferno oil was not as intimidating as it sounds and SO umami delicious.   My boyfriend got Ki Signature Ramen, but he opted for fried chicken instead of meatballs. He absolutely loved it, though the broth was so incredibly rich. He couldn't finish a lot of the broth because it was a full of flavor & on the greasy side.  My boyfriend got the donut bao for dessert - it was sooooooo good! It was light and fluffy, almost like a cinnamon sugar croissant. The caramel on the side wasn't too sweet and was very good, but I don't even think the donut needed it. It was solid on its own.  The service was awesome & I liked that they gave us a glass jug of water on the table instead of having to ask for refills constantly!   Overall, this was my very first homemade ramen experience, and I cannot wait to come back! It was so delicious and laid back, equally perfect for any beginner or ramen enthusiast!",

It was surprising to find a single hair on top of my bowl given how clean cut the environment seemed. I'm hopeful it appeared in transition from the kitchen to the table-perhaps from the server or a patron.   Regardless, I'd be willing to give this spot another chance.

The best part about their menu is that you can mix and match whatever you don't want for anything else on the add ons menu. Our waiter was super knowledgable and provided excellent service. The only reason I did not give this place a 5 is because of the price. One pork bun for $6 and a bowl of ramen for $15 is definitely above market price compared to most ramen places.",

The noodles were fine. Broth okay. Veggies not the greatest as the addition of acorn squad slices created an undercooked and awkward crunch. Sorry to say but I would not be returning on another visit to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "SOLID 3.5 STARS.  Came here for an early dinner, and was not disappointed.  Ordered the Ki Signature Ramen for $15 and a Donut Bao for $5. The ramen came out pretty fast, and the presentation was great. The broth was not too salty, noodles just slightly underdone (but chewy so no complaints), served with egg and generous pieces of brisket and pig ear (other ingredients too but I forgot what they were). As a matter of fact, a few people I was with found the brisket and pig ear pieces to be too large (not a problem for me) - perhaps smaller pieces with more frequency would be appropriate. Overall it was a pretty satisfying bowl of ramen. The donut bao was a little bit underwhelming as it was a spice/sugar dusted bao (think chinese donut) served with a chocolate/caramel dipping sauce. Had the bao been filled with the sauce or served with ice cream I think it would have made the dessert really stand out. Service was quick and attentive.  Definitely if I was in the area again and had a hankering for ramen, I'd come back again.",

Don't get me wrong - everything was very good, however I don't think ramen is as a flavorful as I expected. If this is your first experience with ramen I'll warn you the menu is hard to navigate. I wish I asked for a recommendation, but instead went with the Miso Ramen with fried chicken. I could have done without the friend chicken. Maybe the pork would have been better. Overall just OK.   We also had the edamame and goyza. Both were fantastic! I never say edamame is good and this place blew me away. We also ordered drinks which we were pleased with. Nothing spectacular.  If you're looking for ramen in Pittsburgh I'd give it a try. They have lots of options and the space is great. I'm anxious to try some other ramens in the city and see how it stacks up.",

    "text": "A small group of us stopped by for dinner on a Saturday evening. The restaurant inside was much bigger than I expected, with three levels of seating, including a full bar area on the lower level. Our service was quick, with the waitress answering our questions and making suggestions for us. Since one person in our group does not eat pork, and their main broth appeared to include pork, she made a great recommendation of subbing miso broth and adding fried chicken on top of the ramen. We appreciated how flexible/accommodating they were with their menu items!   We each got something a big different, but I personally tried the inferno ramen as a big fan of spice. It had a great flavor (similar to ma-la, but more chili flavor and less peppery) and was delicious with the brisket. The portion seemed fair for the price and everything appeared to be freshly prepared. I didn't try others' ramen, but everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.   My friend also tried the Sherry Manhattan drink and loved it! He definitely had a \"wow!\" face on after the first sip, so kudos to the bartenders!",

They launched a new menu and the vegetarian option (now there's only one) was sub-par. The broth was incredibly plain and the mix-ins were honestly inedible. The mushrooms they include in this dish are NOT for the faint of heart (rubbery, dark, strange) and the flavors of the greens and sprouts did not mesh with the dish.   I'm wondering if there's a new cook staff that doesn't know how to re-create our old favorites. The cucumber app and cauliflower weren't as good as they used to be. I'm heartbroken :(",

It would be nice we were able to select a level of spice on a number scale.  The bowl of ramen was also $14-$15. That is suuuper pricey for a very economical dish.",

I started with the pork belly buns which bomb.  They kind of toast/panini the bun and I'm IN TO THIS!!   For ramen, I got the curry and added brisket and my friend got the special.  I also got a side of the spicy oil which kicked up my curry broth perfectly.  I'm still consistently disappointed with Pittsburgh's ramen scene, but overall it was pretty well balanced and satisfied my craving for sure.",

We pretty much had to fight to tear it to pieces. The taste wasn't bad but the longer I looked at it, the harder it was to eat. My partner really enjoyed the Inferno Ramen. Definitely high on the spicy scale, which we love. The noodle texture is slightly gummy, if you care about that. The Miso Ramen left a lot to be desired. The Curry Ramen on the other hand, is great. By far my favorite. I come back specifically for that.    The nitamago egg was absolutely amazing. Overall excited to see what is to come from this place!",

My friend and I ordered the cauliflower and pork ramen that has pork ears. The cauliflower was interesting. But when you really think about it, is a pretty simple dish - one whole chunk of cauliflower deep fried and sprinkled with the usual japanese umami seasoning plus a little sesame sauce on the bottom. The first bite is good, but we both felt that the more you eat it, the heavier it gets and the less appetizing. It basically has the oil but not the crunch or texture of tempura. The umami and sesame seasoning isn't amazing and just doesn't cut the grease. Half way though, I found myself wishing the cauliflower wasn't fried at all. The pork ramen we both couldn't finish (and I love my noodles I always finish them) because of how heavy it was. I see a lot of reviews recommending the vegetable curry ramen - if I ever come back here, I'd probably try that?",

The poor bartender was trying the best she could but she was thrown to the wolves by her manager. Would expect a little better service as they have less than  10 items on their menu and it wasn't a busy night.",

She acted like it was completely normal to just spill water all over our table and not even apologize or give us new napkins. The people working there seemed genuinely miserable. No one smiled  and everyone acted like they did not want to be there and were waiting for their shift to be over. I go out for ramen probably once every week or 2 but will never return to this place because of the extremely rude wait staff. Never again. Go to Tan Izakaya in Shadyside ... the ramen is better - but more importantly- the wait servers are actually nice people and won't treat you like crap.",

The star of the show--the ramen--is tasteless and bland, served lukewarm by an Eeyore of a waiter who seems deflated by the mere presence of customers. The broth lacks richness, the noodles lack bite, the meat is flavorless. . .it's like they took everything that's supposed to be good about a piping hot bowl of well-made ramen and threw it out the window.   I was never a fan of Umami's ramen, but I thought that maybe with the spotlight on one dish, things might improve. That hasn't happened. I just don't get it. It doesn't help to try and gussy something up with fancy add-ins if the fundamental building blocks are terrible.  It's my sincere hope that someday Pittsburgh will get an authentic ramen place without a lot of bells and whistles, because guess what? If done properly, ramen doesn't need much window dressing. If an actual ramen restaurant ever opens here, god help these places popping up that are all swagger and no substance.",

This, however, was on point.  I got the Inferno Ramen and loved everything about it. It's a good level of spice where your mouth isn't melting off, but you can still feel the heat. The egg is soft boiled and the noodles are scrumptious.  The atmosphere is very pleasing. It's not too loud and the lighting is low. I love the bar seating because it puts the bowl right at mouth height and gives you that authentic Ramen feel. It's really roomy inside and has a lot of tables so it isn't too difficult to get seated even on a busy night.  All of the staff were really nice and accommodating, we didn't want for anything. I will definitely be coming back here to fulfill my Ramen craves.",

So Friday night was our first time checking them out and it was a very nice ambiance. Great location, room was very well designed, and staff was friendly.  Let's dive into the food... so we tried the pig ears for our starter and they were good. Neither of us had had them before so we did enjoy and thought it was the best start to trying a new place. I couldn't choose between the Dan Dan or Curry so my boyfriend insisted I order both. He had the one with soy chicken the name is leaving me.  His ramen was not good at all. I excepted the flavor profile to be more and it lacked heavily.  Curry, the flavor was okay but I wasn't raving over the bowl and honestly using curry I expected the dish to do more for my palette.  Dan Dan was by far the best and if I had only gotten that would have probably rated them four even with my boyfriend upset over his failed attempt.  My last comment and I know this me being needy. Wish they had more options or a create your own option. I'd return again but only for the Dan Dan which means I probably won't go back anytime soon.",

    "text": "We had no wait on a Tuesday night during the soft opening, which was good since they (currently) don't accept reservations. We tried the cauliflower and pig's ear, and opted for the shoyu ramen and the dan dan ramen. The cauliflower was quite tasty, and the server's recommendation of pre-cutting the 1/4 head of cauliflower before using chopsticks was a good one. The only downside to the cauliflower was that the neri goma (Japanese tahini) at the bottom was a bit intensely dark...if it were cut a bit, this would be a phenomenal dish. The pig's ear was tasty, but a bit one-note for the portion size--3-4 slivers of pig's ear were enough to intrigue and satisfy, but there were something like 20 in our portion. This would be great as a topping to another dish, but I feel like a half-size would be a better gateway for most diners.  Onto the ramen--we were disappointed. The MSG, togarashi, and pepper blend on the table are great, but in my experience, the only seasoning you should be adding at the table is hot pepper oil, which was nowhere to be found. The noodles didn't have the typical texture; it felt like they weren't alkalized enough or something. They were also square, making them appear to have been extruded or cut rather than pulled. The shoyu broth was well-flavored, but lacked the unctuousness typical of ramen (curiously, the ramen we ate at Umami, Li's other restaurant, last year had this unctuousness, but was over-salted). Then dan dan broth was great--right amount of heat and richness. I'll keep looking for a place in PGH that does traditional (miso/shoyu/tonkotsu) ramen well, but this place is a decent option if you're in Lawrenceville when the craving strikes.",

We made it to lunch, and it was more accessible.  We actually first tried this place when it was a pop- up and DH loved the soup whereas I found my miso bland.  Anyway we gave it another shot.    Ambience -5 neat, clean, although some tables are really smushed together.    Food - the bun was actually really tasty!  We got the veggie bun and had a great texture and flavor.   The ramen was 3-4 stars.  I got the vegetarian one with kimchi and tofu but subbed the tofu for chicken (incidentally not sure the substitution was worthy the extra 4 as the chicken didn't absorb the flavor well and seemed more like an afterthought).    Service - 5.  Our waitress was quite good, friendly, and popped up without being overbearing Price-1.   The food was filling, but not sure it was worth the price.  After adding in all the extras/subs, it was ok.   The base ones should have already had some of the 'extras.' Anyway -my 2c!",

Before my first trip here the only ramen experience I had was the 28 packs from the grocery store, so I was really excited to try some real ramen, and I was not disappointed. Ki has a hip atmosphere, and it's pretty loud inside. Service was great all 3 times (one time was takeout but the person at the front station was super friendly and chatty while I waited for my food). The most memorable bowl has been the miso bowl, to which I added crispy pig ears, edamame, and bean sprouts. Flavors melded well, everything was fresh and delicious. Bowl with additions was $17 before tip so definitely a splurge meal. When I ordered takeout, the broth was packaged separately from the rest so that stuff didn't get soggy and that was great; it was just as good after a 20 minute drive as it was fresh in house. The bao buns were a great appetizer as well.",

I believe it was the Kim Chi that made the front of the house have a foul odor, but whatever it was made for a bad start to the dinner.  We still ordered the Kim Chi; it's been a while since I last ordered it from a pretty authentic Korean restaurant in town and was having a craving for it.  This tasted nothing like I remembered.  As I mentioned previously, the smell was pretty bad and that made it hard to enjoy.  Plus it was overly spiced and didn't seem to have much cabbage.  The ramen bowl was okay, I got the SHOYU RAMEN but subbed out the chicken for brisket.  Brisket was good and tender with very generous amounts in the bowl.  Still a bit pricey at $12.  Service was very good but can't say I enjoyed the gangster rap music soundtrack while eating.    Overall, wouldn't rush back.  I would stick to the ramen only, avoid the kim chi, and try not to notice the foul odor that permeates the house.",

I also had the sake beer, which I had been meaning to try for a while. I ordered the crispy pig ears, I think my dog would have loved them. They had a peppery flavor on them, similar to what was on the table. The meat was just more fatty and less crispy, than i was expecting. Probably wouldn't get them again.  I ordered the beer shank inferno Ramen, which had a great salty/peppery flavor. I wouldn't say it was overly spicy, as the name would suggest. The beef was moist and tender, the egg was eggy, and the cabbage was a good addition for texture. My friends ordered the veggie curry and the shoyu ramen. Their broths were both seasoned perfectly as well. My friend loved her shoyu ramen, which had a peanut buttery flavor with some extra spice from the chile paste. I would probably order that one next time.   The end.",

Broth was on point, not too over powering but so full of flavor and noodles were beyond perfect. The layout inside is really cool, there is a casual sitting area on the main floor, bar seating upstairs where you can watch your food being made and an actual bar downstairs. Staff was super personable and knowledgeable about the menu. Our waitress was able to give us great recommendations. Can't wait to see the full menu!",

The space is awesome. There are three levels with plenty of seating. I ordered the inferno beef Ramen which had a good beefy broth with a moderate amount of heat. It's not as spicy as the name implies. I would have liked a little larger portion size. It leaves plenty of room in the stomach for an appetizer or two which I did not try. I'll definitely give Ki Ramen another visit when the restaurant officially opens.",

The atmosphere is very modern and hipster. You have three options to sit, in the dining area, the bar area, or the kitchen area. We chose the kitchen area and it was great! We ordered the fried cauliflower as a snack and it was delicious! I ordered the shio ramen and ate every bite. The only thing I would change is the pig ear. It was my first time trying it, and now I can check that off my list. I certainly wouldn't care if I ever eat it again. The customer service was great, and sitting in the kitchen area we got to talk to the chef. It was a great experience all around, and look forward to my next visit.",

I loved the list of add on's and spices available (you could probably make your own bowl).   We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday. There was a crowd, but we beat the rush and did not have to wait (when we left around 7:30 there was a wait for tables). I had never had ramen before, so I am glad we came here!",

The decor is really cute and kitschy, which I personally enjoy.  There are currently 6 ramens on the menu, and there are a couple of snack items as well. I tried the crispy pig ears, the Inferno ramen (spicy beef shank), and the Shoyu ramen (chicken).   I personally liked the Shoyu ramen best. The chicken inside it was delicious, and both of the broths were very savory.   The noodles are handpulled at the restaurant. They were very very hard, to the point of being raw still. Now I personally love that, but I know a lot of people like their noodles less chewy than that.   I'm sure if it was because they were quite busy, but I definitely want to try again to see if the noodles are still as hard next time.   The food came out quickly! I'm excited to see how the menu continues developing. One thing I wish they had were more Asian drinks--seeing things aside from ginger beer, and getting non-alcoholic drink options such as Ramune, or Calpico, would've made the experience more authentic.",

My best girlfriend was in town and I needed to go to Wild Card for a birthday gift (I get every gift there) so we wanted to stay in the general area. I've been on a spicy soup kick and thought that Ki Ramen would be a good option! We both ordered the same thing, the meat bao of the day and the inferno ramen. The boa was ok. It was a play on an Italian beef with rapini, and horseradish. Not bad but the meat was fatty and only a small amount was given. My ramen though...out of control.I added enoki mushrooms and chili paste. The soup was so perfectly spicy. I drank all of the broth because it was so flavorful and delicious. Dreaming about my next meal at Ki Ramen and I can't wait to try Ki Pollo!",

They had a good selection of drinks, including several types of sake, and I believe they have a rotating IPA draft as well. We ordered the meat bao bun to share - that day it was fried chicken. We loved it!  For our main dishes we ordered dan dan (me) and inferno (fiance). I subbed the onsen egg (sous vide - soft boiled) for the nitamago and added mushrooms. I'm so glad that I swapped the eggs - the soft boiled egg broke down and added so much extra flavor to my noodles! Probably didn't need the mushrooms, but they were a good add on. Next time I want to try a butter bomb! The noodles were perfectly cooked, although I wish there were more of them. My fiance loved the inferno ramen, especially the chicken skin. I love that you're able to customize your flavor with the seasonings at the table.  Honestly, my fiance and I can't wait to go back! I probably will never get anything other than the dan dan because I loved it so much. But I want to try some of the other rotating bao buns!",

There were only two of us, so we were seated quickly and there were a few other tables for small groups at that hour.  I'm not sure I've had ramen too many other times to compare, but I really enjoyed my meal. The boiled egg was perfectly cooked and the chicken in the shoyu ramen was very tender and tasty. I downed my whole bowl and I also downed a TON of water. So it was very salty, but it didn't taste overpoweringly so. The karakuchi sake was mild and tasty and service was friendly. I found the menu a little pricy for the base items and because of that I didn't add anything on, though some of the add ons looked pretty good! Despite that, I had a good experience and I'll probably be back-after I hunt down other ramen restaurants to see where this clocks in!",

The cauliflower came with a peanut sauce that made it pretty unique. I'm not a big fan of it but my husband seemed to like it a lot. To me it feels like they just cook the cauliflower and sprinkled some spices on it and drizzled the peanut sauce...I can probably make a similar version at home.  The broth was not too bad. Pig ears is definitely some interesting add-on for ramen noodles.  We went on a Friday night, the place was mostly full.  Tbh, I wouldn't say this is a traditional ramen place since a lot of the dishes came with their own twist, which is cool but not what I'm looking for.  I'm giving it a 4 since the service was pretty good.  If you are tired of traditional style of ramen and want to try something unique, this place would be perfect for you.",
