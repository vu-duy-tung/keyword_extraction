My plate was just rice, garlic sauce, and lamb.  For $13/plate, at least load it with tons of rice.  It was decent but I didn't think it was great.    I also got their chicken chili.  It was pretty good.  Lots of beans and a decent amount of chili.  A little bit more of the soup it would have been perfect.  I do love their fresh fruit smoothies.  Their menu is a bit confusing but their fresh fruit smoothie is a blend of bunch of fruits and goes for $1.99.  It has to be the best tasting mix fruit smoothie i've tasted.  Good price too.  I also had their cookie dough cheesecake.  It was fantastic.  Would like a bit more cookie dough though.  Waitress was pretty nice.  Overall, I'd give this place another shot with another dish.",

The food was still just as good--you MUST get the hummus and I recommend any of the pitzas--but the service is absolutely terrible every time.  The worst was when I stopped in for lunch with a friend passing through the 'Burgh for just two hours during a cross-country roadtrip, and it took an hour to be served just a plate of hummus.  The small patio was full and maybe a four tables were being used inside, but plenty of staff walked around.  Our waiter took our drink orders (water) and our appetizer order (hummus), and then my friend asked for an entree recommendation.  He suggested the lamb wrap or salad, and my friend said she'd decide when he came back.  Then: 10 minutes for  drinks (fine) and 20 more for the hummus, with a different server each time.  No one stopped to take our entree orders.  We tried flagging down one of our now three servers without luck.  Finally, the second server brought the check after an hour total.  We didn't have enough time to wait for a manager to complain.  This may have been the worse service I've received in Pittsburgh ever...the staff looks to be made entirely of young undergrads.",

We got excited because we heard this place had the same owner as a delicious upscale Lebanese place in Cleveland that we love with fresh, puffy pitas, fluffy rice and lovely smokey baba ganoush.  This is some of the worst middle eastern food that I have ever had. What wasn't critically overcooked was over-vinagered and over-lemoned. The baba ganoush tasted like it came from a can, the pitas are pre-packaged (like everywhere in Squirrel Hill). The server, while very nice, did not know a thing about middle eastern food and couldn't answer any of our questions about the menu. Frankly, I can't explain why I even gave it a second star, except that I'm feeling generous.  It is also not a nice place to sit, unless you enjoy the feeling of dining inside a convenience store.",

    "text": "Very mixed review.   First, the menu turns me on. I love Mideastern food, and especially love Mideastern vegetarian fare. The menu has tons of things I love to eat, so I have lots and lots of reasons to go back. My boy friend is just opening up to the cuisine, and I really hoped this place would wow him. It could have, but instead just - ummm - \"not bad\"-ed him. More on that soon.  The service was great. For a casual place, way out of the park. The waitress was on spot from the get go. Loved her. When the boy friend spilled an entire iced tea, her coworker came running to help and they both smoothed it over and cleaned up the mess. They even let him have another tea, even though I voted to cut him off since he'd clearly had enough.  So why three stars? Some real bizarreness on their part.   We both had soups, which we loved. I had a wrap, which was great. The hot stuff hot, the cold stuff cold, and everything delicious. He had a sampler with salad, rice, and three kinds of grilled meat. Which was great, except the rice was cold. Not warm, cold. Like grandma sat it outside in the snow cold. He immediately let her know, no problem she'll get hot rice. They just made it fresh. She just as quickly came back and said they would have to microwave it, there would be no fresh order of rice. He wasn't into the idea of microwaved salad and meat, nor the idea of someone picking his plate apart for him to microwave rice, which doesn't taste the best microwaved anyhow. He said never mind forget it. She wasn't liking that idea, kudos to her. She went to the kitchen and got a manager to pry the rice away from whoever was being so cranky about it, and brought it out a few minutes later.  Yay! Fresh, cold rice.   No joke, after she went to all that work to make his order perfect, they sent out cold rice a second time. He wasn't eating it so I stuck my finger in it to see - yeah, about the temperature of my carrot juice. Cool. Not warm. Not very appetizing, and not even a safe temperature to keep food.   Silly thing to get wrong twice, I think. So aside from that, I was very, very happy with the place, and want to go back. I hope they'll earn back that last star.",

    "text": "This place was nice as far as decor and surroundings but it didn't leave me with the impression that its somewhere I'd frequent. I've been to several Greek restaurants and although this one has the biggest menu I wasn't too excited about any one dish.  When we were seated our waiter Tyler who was a great sport during our request for extra items. He was patient and played along with us as we joked. We ordered a lot of food just to see what different flavor they had to offer.  We order grape leaves, baba ganoush, two salads one with falafel and one aladdin salad and some kind of heart shaped pastry dish. I forget the name of it though. So my sister order the heart shaped dish and then decided she didn't want to eat it in order to save room for her salad. The eggplant dip aka baba was not as creamy as hummus  but was more like cottage cheese with a little crunch to it. It was just ok. The pita bread was served cool not warm or hot but cool. It lacked flavor and honestly tasted like bathroom paper towels.   When our salads came I had a dressing that was their tahini yogurt. It had the consistency of sour cream and tasted very much like it. I couldn't use it on my salad though because it had absolutely no flavor. It went great with the falafel but just was not a good dressing for an already bland salad. Both salad only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I asked for kalamata olives on my salad to add some flavor but my sisters was supposed to already have some. When our food came out. Her's was missing olives and i had a full container of them. She tried to take mine because hers didn't have them so we called the waiter over. Tyler told us that her salad was supposed to have olives but that the extra cup did belong with my plate. I paid $1 for those olives!! So he brings her back some olives but only put three on the salad. I was laughing so hard. You give her this huge salad but only 3 olives?? that's an insult to the salad.  So back to my food. I switched out the yogurt for their balsamic vinaigrette which i told i wouldn't be charged for but when the bill came I seen it on there. I didn't make a complaint about $.65 cents but its the principle. After a $38 bill and a meal leaving you wondering if you ate enough. It's unlikely i'll come back anytime soon.",

Delicious hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves, felafel and fresh warm pita bread.  Its also such a large plate that one person could almost make a whole meal out of it.  We had the skewer combo for an entree.  It came with grilled chicken, beef and some kind of delicious stuffed sausage.  The grilled meats were served on top of rice.     The only part that left us kind of underwhelmed was the dessert.  The server showed us the options and pointed to a peanut butter cake, that ended up just being sheet cake with peanuts on top, no peanut butter to be found :-(.  One of the least exciting slices of cake I have had in a while!  Oh well, we will try again next time.   Overall though, this is a great restaurant.  We will certainly be back!",

I've tried almost all of them, and they never disappoint. Before I was gluten free, I loved the pita salads and the other pita rolled options. Addictive!

Starving, thirsty, and super worn out we decided on Aladdins because of their excellent smoothie menu.   Though the service was slow (that's something I've noticed everytime I've been here), the fare was delicious and my friend and I enjoyed the spacious atmosphere and air conditioning.   We both had some sort of strawberry and mango smoothie and downed it alarmingly fast. No regrets there.  We had falafel as an app and it was decent. My friend got the tuna steak salad and I went with a grilled chicken salad. My salad was overflowing with yummy veggies and came with a very good Greek house dressing on the side. It totally hit the spot and left my feeling satisfied without being stuffed. My friend loved his dish as well. I skipped on desert but my friend had a slice of carrot cake to go and later reported it was delicious.   All in all, if you're looking for some lighter fare in Squirrel Hill in a good atmosphere I would recommend you stop here. This place did look like it's accommodating for families as well!!",

Husband Rick was out doing the last of his Christmas shopping.  I thought, \"What better time to order some take-out, plop my butt down on the couch, and eat while watching some TV?\".  Hey, TBS shows \"Seinfeld\" reruns during dinner time!  So I had me some Len-Chili soup--chili with lentils-for a starter.  For my main course I ordered the Chicken Sambusek Plate:  a pita with curry chicken, onions, peas, and spices.  My sides included mixed green veggies, tomatoes, mushrooms, and olives.  All in all, it was a good way to chow down after tying my hair up and slipping into my comfy old sweatpants.",

I took some Arab friends here--they approved and even said it compared to what they would eat at home. That's a good sign in my book!  At some point, I need to save room for dessert.

Their lentil soup is simple yet delicious and any of the rolled pitas are filling choices.  A couple dinner offerings to consider are the Flavor Savor Special or Aladdin's Favorite Combo, which offer an ample variety of Lebanese centric fare.  There's really not a bad choice on this expansive Middle Eastern / Mediterranean menu.  Even the kids menu is appreciated since there's an option for fresh fruit as a side.  If you have any room left the large desserts are tempting, but the peanut butter + chocolate cheesecake was underwhelming -- the search for a delectable, 'must have' dessert continues.

The diners around me were all dressed to the nines and seemed like they were trying to outdo each other in the amount of designer gear they were wearing and stories about their adventures from the night before.  We were seated right away and seemed to have just beat the rush as about a half an hour later, every single table was packed.  Our food was good but nothing to write home about.  Service was decent but not the best.  The second time I went with a part of four around 5:30 on a Saturday evening.  Once again it appeared we just early enough to beat the dinner rush.  The vegetarian appetizer was tasty but filling.  I almost didn't have room for my entree.   I ordered the \"honeymoon\" juice which featured carrots, cucumber and grapes.  The strongest flavor was the cucumber which was fine by me since it is one of my favorite vegetables.  My entree was the jasmine rice with beef.  It was flavorful and the beef was tender although I preferred the taste after I added the hot sauce that was provided on the side.    Service was pretty good and drinks were quickly refilled.  My complaint from this visit was that it was really hot in the restaurant.   It was 90+ degrees that day, but it felt like the air conditioning wasn't on (or if it was, it wasn't working properly).  By the end of our meal, it seemed as if it had finally kicked on.  Overall, the food was decent and I had an enjoyable experience but I'll probably try other places in the area before I return to Alladin's again.",

The staff is efficient and our guy made up for his error on the drinks by offering free pita bread to go with our complimentary hummus.   The food- we had the flavor savor platter and the taza chicken salad. The salad was to DIE for, hands down the freshest and juiciest salad I have ever had. It was so good we took one to-go with us. The platter was way better than what I've experienced from ME cuisine. The rice was not bland but complemented the kabobs well, which themselves were juicy and tender. The falafel was done right for once, with the right amount of crustiness to it.   I would definitely visit this gem of a joint again. I wouldn't be averse to experimenting with their other dishes, as what we ordered was definitely A+ grade.",

    "text": "I want to give this restaurant 5 stars because everything was perfect! The food, the service and cleanliness. I ordered hummus, curry chicken pita wrap and Alladin Favourite platter.  The wrap was just excellent with very complex flavors. Its a must must try. It as priced at $4.50, which is great. I liked it so much that I got 2 wraps to go as well :)  The hummus was creamy and smooth. The platter was good but I would not say excellent because the chicken pieces had dried out a bit, but I wont complain as chicken sometimes gets a little dry.   The service was prompt and our servers were very courteous. I will definitely go back and try more things n the menu.",

    "text": "Hummus chicken plate and a honeymooner! After a funfilled Gluttonous, and overindulging weekend of Nachos, Mac n' Cheese, Martinis and hot dogs I needed a break!   The best thing about Aladdin's is that it's not like I have to compromise on taste and turn into a cow chewing some cud. This place has delicious AND healthy selections! When HB asked me to dine I said \"Only if we can eat at Aladdin's my gut needs a hiatus from the unhealthy choices I made all weekend.\"   I have been doing the awesome onesome for quick lunches here for Years! These are my favorites!  The fresh squeezed natural Juices! You can do fruit smoothies or Raw juice combos! I don't drink coffee I opt for Raw Juices, some people get their caffeine fix to give them a boost. I'm already way too hyper so I get my energy kick from the Honeymooner! Carrot, Grape, and Cucumber Juices. I ask for it light on Carrot with an overdose of Cucumber.  For a soupy choice try the Len-Chili, half veggie chili and lentil soup. If you are partial to paring add the Almond salad. Fresh mixed greens, mushrooms, cucumbers, sprouts, roasted almonds! The dressing is also AMAZING, light and yogurty. It has a fantastic flavor.  If in the mood for something a little heavier try the Jaffar's Pitza. It's really good. Veggie chili topped with cheddar cheese and tahini yogurt dressing.  For an Entree hummus is plentiful in the hummus chicken plate, Chicken Mishwi, diced tomato, and parsley. Pita on the side. The chicken is always moist, slighty charred, and smokey but with the bean spread and fresh tomato mix on a pita I feel good about what I am consuming. Everything is always verdant!   Watch Out for the desserts. On my way out I always cover my eyes because the gourmet cakes start pounding on the display case doors asking for a ride to my fridge.",

I miss their falafel and hummus. I haven't found a place in NY that duplicates the freshness and balance of flavors Aladdin has.  I miss their wraps and rolled pitas. I know it's not ethnic, but get their chicken salad pocket. It's one of the things I crave when I'm in NY.   I miss their soups. Get any of their soups. If you're not sure which one to get, try one of their combos. The flavors always work with each other.  The only thing I wished for is that  I tried their desserts. They taunt you from the glass case when you walk into Aladdin's.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this place. My wife and I were looking for vegetarian options in our neighborhood and we were favorably impressed. It was also past nine when we got there, and we weren't the only people. I like it when places are open late.  We each had a glass of the Lebanese table wine, and we tried both white and red. They were lighter tasting than, say, CA wine, but very flavorful and drinkable. They're not served in actual wine glasses and I'm embarassed to say I got some up my nose when I tried to smell the wine :)  We split a falafel salad plate and a mojadarah plate. Now, these are both things we can make at home (in the case of falafel, with considerable effort and bother), but I thought Aladdin's did a good job on these basic dishes. The baked onions on top of the mojadarah were a lot better than I can do, and the falafel didn't have any of the typical pitfalls (well cooked, neither dry nor greasy). The falafel is fried in peanut oil, which I liked. It tastes different from grapeseed (lighter) and I might switch over to that if I ever make falafel again at home.  We barely finished both plates. Portions were generous and if we hadn't been so hungry we might have taken some home. I wasn't crazy about the pita bread and we didn't eat more than a bite or two of that, but we finished off everything else. The garnishes were very good. In particular, the lebanese salad garnishing the mojadarah really improved the dish--it added a nice bit of acid, and we gobbled it up.  The atmosphere is diner-ish but there are tables where you can sit outside. We'll definitely be going back when we want a cheapish veggie meal and are too lazy to cook.  This would be a good place for groups--low stress environment to sit and chat a while with dinner.",

The food was fresh, healthy and delightfully affordable. I recommend the chicken lentil soup, though I thought the hummus was a bit too bland. My father raved about the Shawarma Salad (beef and lamb strips over mixed greens), and my mom loved the Rolled Chicken Salad Pita. Our neighboring diners had the falafel, which looked delicious.   What I especially love is that Aladdin's is a great place for vegetarians and carnivores to eat together in harmony. I can't wait when my college friends come out here to visit. My only suggestion would be to spice up the interior a bit. It doesn't need to become a cheesy harem, but right now it looks like a generic Panera Bread.",

I've been there three times, and each time, this has been the slowest restaurant I've been to in the entire city.   My guess at why they always look busy is that everyone's been stuck there for two hours, and that tends to keep it full.  If someone convinces me they fixed the problem with the speed, I'd gladly head back, but until then, they've burned through my goodwill.",

The menu is full of a variety of flavorful, creative, inexpensive, HEALTHY foods, many of which are vegetarian.  They offer everything from salads and soups to wraps and pita pizzas to full dishes.  Their hummus and pita is a must for an appetizer, and they boast some of the best falafel I've ever eaten (and I'm a falafel freak).  The smoothies and desserts are also excellent, so I suggest going more than once to get a taste of the incredibly selection they have!",

    "text": "Aladdin's restaurant in Squirrel Hill has enjoyed a loyal following since its opening.  The food is fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the service is good on a consistent basis.  What most people don't know however, is that Aladdin's Eatery is a chain.  Founded in 1994 by Fady and Sally Chamoun, their dream has become a highly successful business promoting health and friendliness. Following high standards, philosophies and basic fundamentals, Aladdin's Eatery restaurants enjoy satisfied customers who always come back for more. (Source <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FAladdinsEatery.com&s=f97c7416e5c9b3dac493d123fd88675c2efca6ddfb329166150558615ee02ba6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">AladdinsEatery.com</a>)  The success of the restaurant has grown to over 30 locations on the East Coast.   Contributing to the success is the exactness in which the meals are prepared.  No matter which location you choose, you can count on your humus platter being the same.  Customers like consistency.  I always order the humos (as spelled in their menu) and tabouli.  We often order extra pita to help us lap up the olive oil on the plate.  The tabouli (A delicate mixture of parsley, onions, cracked wheat and tomatoes seasoned with extra virgin olive oil, lemon and herbs) is tasty as well.  The lemon is refreshing, and clean tasting; almost like a palate cleanser.  Other appetizers include: Kibbie, (beef with bulgar wheat), Baba, (pureed eggplant and tahini) Foole M Damas (puree of fava beans, garlic and olive oil, served with pita).  It's easy to finish off the appetizers; they're light and refreshing.  Entrees include, salads, pita pizzas, salad specialties, rolled pitas, and restaurant specialties.  If you're a vegetarian, you're going to be one happy camper!  Half the menu is meat free, and there are plenty of protein-substitutes to choose from.  The pita pizzas are a nice choice and consist of a small amount of olive oil, feta cheese and a combination of chicken, lamb and other vegetables.  There are all kinds of combinations here; use your imagination and make an original!  The rolled pitas are also good- grilled meat or falafel, with lettuce, vegetables and tahini-yogurt dressing.   If you're looking for something more substantial, try the Mediterranean Lamb Plate- tender strips of marinated char-grilled lamb, served with seasoned white rice with vermicelli, topped with sauteed pine nuts, almonds, and cinnamon. You can opt for Garlic Sauce or Tahini Yogurt dressing.  Desserts are abundant and delicious.  I always feel satisfied, but never too full when I leave Aladdin's.  The food is light and fresh; give it a try and you'll know what I mean. Aladdin's Eatery (412) 421-5100 Squirrel Hill/ CMU 5878 Forbes Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15217",

Also the house made garlic sauce is off the chain delicious!   Desserts at Aladdins are also great- the Burma baklava is awesome BUT if they have carrot cake- get a piece- you'll thank me.

Serving a basket of plain pitaas and no dip is like being serv d chips without salsa.  We will be back!",

I wish they had had a photo because what I got was not what I envisioned.  My appetitie was light at dinner time as I had a large lunch so thought it would be a simple pita filled with tabouli.  It was a HUGE, GIGANTIC pita (never seen anything like it) filled with tabouli with lettuce underneath.  Not something you pick up and eat.  So I proceeded to eat with a fork.  The tabouli itself -- I've had others I liked better.    Anyway, I'll try again another time.  The menu options are plenty and the prices reasonable.",

My order was ready in about ten minutes, and the staff were polite. I got the Chicken Sambusek plate, which has chicken, onions, herbs, and spices folded in a pita pie with a salad.   The filling was delicious--the chicken tender, slightly charred, and seasoned well. The small amount of vegetables broke up the meatiness. However, the texture of the pita ranged from crunchy to soft to tough and chewy. I wasn't a fan of the tough, chewy parts, and a lot of the pita had that texture. I ate the food soon after I got it, while it was still warm, so I don't think time was the issue. In addition, the accompanying salad was a little lackluster. While the vegetables were fresh, they didn't seem to form anything cohesive. The dressing didn't help much; it contributed more of an oily mouth feel than flavor.  Although I won't be seeking out opportunities to return, I wouldn't mind trying some other menu items, especially the meats.",

My friend and I ordered Dawali wraps which was our first encounter with dolma - he said it was the best Mediterranean wrap he's ever had. It was a little more sour and tangy than I was expecting but I'm not complaining, I'm still glad I tried it. The vegetarian chili has the perfect amount of heat and is a good size for sharing, or it could be a meal on its own for one person. No skimpy small cup of soup for sure.   The atmosphere is cozy with ambient music. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the amount of food you get. We spent less than $20 for a filling dinner and leftovers. It's really too bad this place is hours from home because we'd love to eat here often.",

I've hit several middle eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh...Kassab's, Nellie's, Med Grill, ordered from Shiraz...  Everyone says that the nearby Med Grill is better but I disagree, it just never does it for me.  Aladdin's is my hands down favorite, and it's my favorite because it has remained consistently great across multiple locations for several years!    It sucks when you find a menu item at restaurant you love so much you look forward to ordering it every time you dine there, and then...the food changes.  It's like they've rick rolled the menu.  Aladdins and I have known each other for so long and they've never let me down!  (that was so lame.  I am so sorry)  Aladdin's is a mini chain, they have locations in Mt Lebanon, Sq Hill, and the North Hills.  The decor is the same across all the restaurants, it's simple, warm, and inviting.  This is a casual restaurant you could bring a date to, or the family--if your kids will eat hummus.    Aladdin's has my favorite hummus.  I LOVE hummus.  I'm always trying to make my own hummus taste like Aladdin's but it just never works.  All of their smoothies are great, and they are blended fresh upon order--as in \"We are cutting up the bananas for you now!\" fresh, no mixes here!  There's something for everyone on the menu, even the person who hates middle eastern food (just have them order one of the pizzas, or the chicken salad.  the chicken salad is really great).  I have alot of friends who are vegetarian, and several that have issues with gluten and Aladdin's is one of those restaurants where everyone is happy and accommodated.  Here are MY personal favorite menu items:  the hummus the tabbouleh the Diwali roll the falaffel roll the schwarma salad--this is what i usually order.  its an excellent salad with steak on it.  it's delicious!  The desserts are incredible, when you walk into Aladdin's your def going to notice the cakes under the register.  I've never had the dessert there, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but they look amazing!",

LET ME TELL YOU IT WAS WINE WEDNESDAY!!!! What a great day to come! $5 glasses of wine and $2 beers! It was amazing.   We started off with appetizers and then didn't stop for a long time.   Appetizers:  Hummus: A creamy blend of chickpeas pureed with tahini and lemon juice, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil: Yummy! AND Yelp gave me a coupon for a free small order. Let me tell you, that small order was great. I love the creamy texture. Yum. I sometimes think that it could be better but I do not know what I would pick out as missing.   Baba Gannouj: Fire-roasted eggplant pureed with tahini, fresh garlic, and lemon juice, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil: This is my jam. I love eggplant. And I love that it comes with a side of spicy sauce that you can mix in or just keep on the side. We destroyed this small plate. There was a bit of the hummus left over but none of this. Tasted very fire roasted and smokey. Yummy.   Loubie Bzeit vgn: Italian green beans sauteed with onions, whole cloves of garlic, fresh tomatoes, and extra virgin olive oil: Our group of friends has a little joke about loubie since one of us thought it was pronounced loogie (like spit). I thought the dish was good, but not the best version I have tried. I think it was because of the bean choices. I like rounder beans and these ones were the flat ones and there were not enough tomatoes in the dish. But I would still get it again because even if was slightly lacking it was still good.   Salad Entrees:  Chicken Mishwi Salad: Fire-grilled marinated chicken thigh over greens, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, calamata olives, scallions, and feta. Choice of dressing: We ordered this because we needed some fresh veggies. It was a salad. Not anything out of this world but it was good.   Pita Pizzas:  Ali Baba Pitza: Baba Gannouj topped with roasted eggplant, sliced tomatoes, feta, slivered calamata olives, and a sprinkle of oregano: This was my jam. I love the idea of using the pita bread as a pizza shell. This was a really good pizza BUT I will say we used that spicy sauce to sprinkle a bit on the top. It had a good flavor but no zing to it. I thought the addition made it perfect.   Sultan's Shawarma Pitza: Tahini Yogurt dressing topped with shawarma meat, onions, sliced tomatoes, diced cucumbers, and flakes of sweet basil: Oh yes. It was basically a gyro on a pizza. YUMMY. I would get this again for sure. I could not believe how much meat was on this pizza! It was over flowing with goodness. I do wish they had more cucumbers and less meat but then again I might be disappointed with less meat!!  It was a great night with great service and food. I cannot wait to go back on another wine Wednesday!!!",

I've eaten there over ten times now, so I feel confident whenever I recommend this place to a friend or bring someone new there.   My favorite items are the lentil soup topped with chicken and the Vegetarian Sampler. The soup makes a light but complete meal, and it's very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. On the larger side, the Vegetarian Sampler is composed of several of their vegan appetizer dips, stuffed grape leaves, four pieces of falafel, and several pieces of pita bread on the side. It takes me back to being in the Middle East every time I eat it! All of the rolled pitas (Aladdin's version of a wrap) are a sure bet as well. Each one I've had is delicious. Besides the food, there is a decent beer selection and a wonderful juice and smoothie menu. It's the perfect accompaniment to your meal. With food and service this great I know I'll continue eating at Aladdin's as long as I'm living in Pittsburgh. I'm happy it's an institution here!",

The only thing I don't like is their room temperature pita that they serve with everything. How much effort does it take to toast/ warm it up? On the plus side, they serve fresh pressed juices which are rare to find at typical sit- down restaurants. I also like their falafel appetizer, baba ganoush, hummus, chicken curry wrap and pitzas. The desserts in the display case look delicious though I have never tried any. All in all a decent place with reasonable prices and consistently good food.",

After my experience here and seeing the positive Yelp reviews, I was surprised there wasn't a longer wait for dinner on a Saturday night. We came in and were seated right away. The restaurant has a very causal ambiance but not so much that you feel like you're in a takeout place at all, very simple but nice. Though I wasn't looking for the options, the menu is very vegan, vegetarian and gluten free friendly as each page notes what dishes are appropriate for specific types of eaters. As an appetizer we got the Chicken Sambusek which was so unique and really flavorful. We split it between two people and it was the perfect size for an appetizer. For our meals we ordered the Mediterranean lamb plate which came with rice and yogurt sauce, as well as the Sultan's Shwarma Pitza. The lamb was tender and done perfectly with the right amount of pink, and the rice was fluffy and uniquely flavored with nuts and cinnamon. I've had more flavorful yogurt sauces but this one was still delicious. The Sultan's Shwarma was something I'd definitely get again as well...the combination of beef, onions, tomato, yogurt sauce and herbs was amazing. I also got the free hummus appetizer from checking in. Definitely the most different and unique type of hummus I've had, it was much thinner and more lemony than hummus I'm used to but it was still good. I'd definitely be back again.",

They were all delicious. The rolls come with pickled turnips and greens which gives it a nice sour crunch. I also recommend the Flavor Savor Special. The plate is large and you can get a taste of a variety of things they offer in their rolls. Their smoothies also taste great, although a little small and expensive.  As for desserts, the only thing I tried were the boxed cookies they sell near the register. The pistachio ones are heaven. They're great to buy as a present for a friend :)  Overall love this place.

I also particularly like to get the hot sauce on the side to accompany the wrap. The chicken pieces are succulent and highly flavorful. They have a wide range of entrees, and I particularly like the Jasmine's favorite.  I also get the baklava to go sometimes (for a party or a potluck).

The place is usually not too crowded, so getting a table should be easy enough to do. The ambiance is casual and the waitstaff is nice. Good place to bring kids.   I generally start with hummus and it is quite good. The only bad thing about it is the pita is not freshly made throughout the day, but rather store bought and warmed up. Hummus with a freshly made pita is amazing and wish it was available. The mains are quite good with sizable portions. The drink menu is a bit limited for alcohol, but they should have enough for everyone to find something they like. I will definitely be back to Aladdin's.",

We ordered the hummus appetizer, Baba Gannouj, beef Shawarma rolled pita, and the favor savor special.   The hummus and baba gannouj were both excellent. I personally liked the hummus better but that's my preference. The pita these appetizers came with however was not very good. It tasted like store bought pita, definitely not made in house and also not warmed. This was a bummer because the appetizers themselves were great. I would recommend these and would order them again.   I was not impressed with the beef Shawarma rolled pita. The pita bread was very crispy, almost burnt. The beef was great but they could have been more generous with the amount of beef. I wasn't a huge fan of the turnips and pickles the rolled pita came with. Overall, would not order this meal again.   The flavor savor was pretty good. My fiance thought the meat was a bit overcooked but still had great flavor, the salad and rice with it was delicious. Would order this meal again.   They also have a huge selection of cakes which we did not try as we were pretty full. They all looked delicious though.   We would come back to this restaurant and try a couple other dishes, but would probably try some other restaurants in the area first.",

I will probably continue to go there even though it is a little farther from my home.  There was a line when we walked in of people waiting for tables and picking up takeout. We were seated fairly quickly. I must say it was cold inside the restaurant, especially considering we were having a warmer day for us. I was shivering.  The vegetarian combo is a favorite and we frequently order it. It comes with hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves, tabouli and falafel. The falafel was a bit darker and drier than usual. It comes with tahini sauce to dip it in. I always ask for hot sauce and mix the two.   We decided to try the fattoush salad for something different. My main complaint about this was it was literally swimming in dressing. There was a giant puddle in the bottom of the bowl when we were done. The taste was okay, though not the best fattoush I have had. It was messy to eat without dressing dripping everywhere.  We had a gift card to use. They do not allow you to put the tip on the gift card. I know some restaurants don't but our waitress did not tell us. We had to ask the hostess to confirm. Service was lacking and not particularly friendly.  Overall I found the food and service both to be better at other locations. I probably won't return to this particular location. However as a chain I definitely recommend Alladin's.",

The large came with 6 pieces, topped with crumbs of feta cheese  I had the \"falafel pitza\", which was a flat pita topped with banana peppers, tomato, and of course falafel. I love how the pita was toasted so that it was a little crunch, and the falafel was delicious, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they charge extra for hot sauce!",

The food is fresh and tasty with portions that are huge. I am a fan of their plates and pitzas, but I also love the salad options.   But to me Aladdin's really shines in appetizers. Our standard is the humus - a massive portion that filling and delicious (there is a small hint of lemon that makes the whole thing feel really bright and satisfying). But we also love the falafel and the loubie bzeit.   My only complaint is that whenever we eat in, the service is often spotty. Sometimes service is outstanding, while other times it seems as though our server forgets about us. My recommendation: order takeout (particularly if you have a tighter schedule).",

I would not recommend and I don't plan to come back. Too bad. When the waitress came, she asked if everything was fine. I said no, the bread was old, after taste in the humus, and she said nothing then brought the bill. I left more than half my plate. Having worked in the restaurant industry normally people ask you if you would like something else. I would have declined because my goal is not to have a free meal but the fact they didn't even offer speaks volume. Save your money and go to another place. Two stars because I got my food fast .",

If you're looking for a magic carpet ride, or a genie in a bottle, maybe your food experience here will be commensurate.  I have had the shwarma and pizza in the past and can vouch for its deliciousness.  It is savory and quite a munificent portion.  As a new vegan, my delight brimmed as I finished reading through their large vegetarian menu.  Many things can then be modified for vegans.  I recommend the falafel wrap and jasmine's favorite rice.  The wrap is one of the biggest falafel wraps I have ever eaten and the rice is a great side with it if you're hungry - otherwise, it is a separate entree!    Great place for a quick bite to eat!

I know this is not the same location but how different can the food be for this kind of chain (although at the time of getting food there I did not realize this was a chain).  We got food to go so I can't comment on the service.  I don't recall exactly the names of things we got but I know that there was lentil soup (completely underwhelming, over-spiced with oregano??? but otherwise bland), grape leaf wraps (bland and boring), and two pitas...one with lamb the other a combo.  My husband's combo pita wrap was alright, nothing to write home about though.  My lamb wrap was good enough to eat when there were no other options but not flavorful enough for fond memories of a meal.  Basically, other no-so super Lebanese eateries could wipe the floor with Aladdin's food.  I will never go back and would not recommend unless you are desperate and want to avoid other questionable places like Ruby Tuesday, TGIF, etc or nasty fast food.",

A typical dinner for us is the chicken chili soup, lamb salad, chicken mishwi salad and a shawarma roll.  Jasmine's rice & veggies are another favorite.  They do have the traditional dishes-- hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, etc also.  They are fine but not exceptional.  I should mention that the menu is actually quite long with all the variations of the basic items, so you have to experiment with various dishes.

Its decor is Cheesecake Factory-esque, and even the menus were bound with the same type of plastic coil used for the menus at Cheesecake.  Anyways, getting to the service...  Our waitress WREAKED OF SMOKE when she came up to pick up our appetizer dish; apparently she had gotten a ciggie in between our dishes, along with a slight headwind.  However, she was a nice waitress, and was very responsive in refilling our drinks when we were running low.  We were seated towards the back of the restaurant, in the awkward corridor between the main dining room and the restroom.  Frankly, I don't think that they should even have tables there....it definitely has that secondary priority feel to it.  We ordered a hummus+pita appetizer, along with their beef kafka and combination signature plates. The hummus had an overbearingly nutty taste to it, which, although not too bad, was quite a surprise to my taste buds.  The beef kafka were all slightly charred on the outside.  Not charred that it gave distinctive texture to the meat, but charred as in I could taste burn chips.  They had obviously left it cooking for too long, and I could tell also because the meat could have been juicier.  All in all, because of its convenient location, I would probably come back if i craved mediterranean food, but in the meantime, I'll be seeking other places to try out.",

The restaurant was empty, and she muttered something about getting very busy. I ordered the chicken salad, which I have had many times before. The menu clearly states that it comes with feta or cheddar. The salad was brought to me without any cheese and, when I asked for feta, I was told there would be an up charge for cheese. I commented that I had ordered that salad many times and never charged extra for the cheese. The waitresses comment was, \"Sorry, there's a up charge.\" It seemed to be ridiculous to make a fuss about an small up charge, but I took a to go menu with me and checked the salad. Sure enough, the cheese is included in the chicken salad....no up charge. I will avoid the Squirrel Hill location in the future. The staff in the North Hills location is very friendly, attentive and well trained. The atmosphere really can make or break a dining experience.",

Every time I've been here, the service was at least adequate, but it's sometimes very good.  This place is also fantastic for vegetarian options, and tastes very fresh.",

I am a small portion eater and I had a whole big beef shawarma (griled beef with whole bunch of sauces and veggies rolled in pita) all by myself! I didn't even offer my friend any. Well he devoured his chicken salad, which sounds 'nothing much' but it is in every shape and form.  The DESSERT is pretty darn good. They give you a dessert tour. Lots of chocolatey options.  Overall it was one of the best $12 I have ever spent for dinner and dessert!",

The place is located close to Squirrel hill where i have my other favorite eat outs.For some reason i craved for hummus and decided to go here for brunch.As you enter you may be thrown off looking at those huge yummy cakes .I generally lose my appetite entering the place.Mr.Aladdin please change the location for your cakes,but i have heard they are amazing( i am going to save it for my next trip).    We ordered a Falafel salad,Pita strips with hummus and a Falafel wrap.I must say it was great.It totally satisfied my hummus craving and it kinda filled me up.    The place is kind of tiny but i am sure they would soon start a street called Aladdin's eatery;it is packed most of the time. the service is friendly and quick. And yes this was the place where i tried Middle Eastern food the first time *Spirals in front of me* I am not dizzy,it is a flashback for where i was 3 years back :)    -Smriti",

The falafel here is excellent--crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside.  I also enjoy the pickled veggies they add to the rolled pitas.  My brother, who absolutely hates getting his hands dirty/sticky while eating, thought they did a good job rolling the pitas here--no spills.  I like that they serve the dolmas and the foole m damas warm here.  My one quibble is that the pita bread that comes in a basket with the appetizers.  isn't served warm as well.

    "text": "Aladdin's is a franchise with almost 30 locations in a few different states.  Still, as evidenced by all the accolades on the wall, the food is better than what you'd expect from a chain.  My boyfriend grew up eating at Aladdin's in Cleveland with his family, so he was excited to have a location near our apartment in Pittsburgh.  He came home the other day raving about their spicy kafta rolled pita, so when we needed a quick dinner on Saturday night, we decided to turn to them for takeout.  They have very convenient online ordering, which was great, and there is no fee for it.  You get a free hummus with your first online order, so that was delightful.  The only thing to remember is that after your first online order, you have to call the restaurant and confirm it - you just need to do it the first time, I guess so they can make sure you are a real person or something.  They told us to be there to pick up the food in 20.  We were there on time and our food was ready.  We had our free hummus, some falafel, a lentil soup, the chicken sambusek, and the Mediterranean lamb.  We were hungry, as you can see.  Everything was clearly well-made and very flavorful - the only downside was that none of it was....warm.  I think the food might've been ready about 10 minutes before we picked it up.  So I guess I'd wish they'd been a little more accurate in their estimate of how long the food would take to cook.  Besides the temperature, the food was really tasty.  The falafel had great flavor, though it wasn't quite as soft on the inside and crispy on the outside as I'd have liked (Sababa's falafel is still my ideal!)  The lentil soup was very mild, but restorative.  It was so fresh, light, and lovely.  My boyfriend wasn't a big fan of the hummus - I'm not sure what it was that bothered him, maybe the stronger tahini taste?  I thought it was fine though.  The chicken samusek was really interesting - flavorful, almost smoky chicken wrapped in a pita.  The lamb was delicious also, served over the most lovely cinnamon rice.  But again, the temperature - it affected the taste and the texture of the meat.  Sigh.  I really think this is a 4-star place, we just had a 3-star experience this one time.  I'm sure we'll order from there again and maybe we'll show up early to pick up our food, or dine-in!",

Yum yum!  I'm going to hunt for an Aladdin's when I come back up to the North.  They have a lot of options for both veggie and meat lovers alike.  Personally I like the mujadara (sp?) which is lentils topped with yummy fried onions.  The chicken and hummus plate is excellent because you get that yummy hummus and some meat to go along with it.  I find that the prices are okay, usually about $7-$10 a dish, which is not too bad.  One thing I didn't like: Their smoothies are kinda overpriced though (like $5 or something) but I did try one, and they're pretty good.",

For starters they charged me twice for tea (4.50) b/c they gave me a second tea bag. Had I known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single bag of cheap tea I would not have ordered it. The least the waitress could have done is have told me that my \"free refill\" was not, in fact, free.  Also, the tuna in the grilled tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcooked. I usually order something different (the mishwi or lamb salad) so I am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse.   I told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that I was correct about her having to tell me but that she didn't and basically that sucks for me. No answer on the fish.   I have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that I was treated this way.",

The service has always been great too. It's never been slow or inattentive. My only complaint is I wish they'd give you some complimentary hummus to go with that plain pita they serve every meal. I guess it's a way to get you to order hummus as a starter; you can't say no when there's pita in front of you!  Their fruit smoothie is smooth and sweet without being overbearing, the inclusion of honey is a nice touch, giving it a bit of added depth.  While I cannot comment on the authenticity of their entrees I can say that their desserts are not authentic at all. At the entrance, behind a glass display, are a variety of yummy looking cakes. I'm not one to balk at cake but I wish the display was filled with baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern desserts to fit with the restaurant better.  Authenticity aside, I can at least say they do better than most Chinese restaurants do when it comes to representing their country's cuisine.",

The falafel is delicious; crunchy but smooth and just the right amount of spice. The dawali (grape leaves) are tangy with a perfect texture and are definitely a staple for me whenever I come here. You can taste how fresh all of the salads and soups are, and no matter what my hunger level is I can always find something to satisfy it. Pro tip: get a side of the hot sauce with EVERYTHING, not sure what's in it but it's the perfect blend of flavors and goes great with the hummus. The prices are great and so is the service.

I was really impressed by how well the meat was cook. The chicken is just done enough so it is soft and tender, you can literally part it with a fork and  the beef kafta is nice and chewy. This dish comes with salad, rice and hummus as well so you get a bit of everything. Service was quick, food out within 15-20 minutes, and quite a bit of seating is available (you wouldn't be able to tell by seeing the front of the store). They also have great desserts like cheesecake (whaaaaat, a mediterranean place has cheesecake? yup). Overall, great place, and highly recommend it.",
