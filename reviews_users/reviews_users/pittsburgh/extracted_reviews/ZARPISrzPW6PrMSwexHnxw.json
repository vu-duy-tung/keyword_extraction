    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Burgatory for their unique burgers, shakes, freshly made cocktails, and fun atmosphere. They have great Create Your Own burger options with different meats, including dry age Wagyu, and options for veggie lovers like a homemade veggie burger with lentils, mushrooms, cashews and cracked wheat.   I always opt for the scratch-made margarita or sangria to accompany my Wagyu burger. I'm a spice lover and the Buffalo cheddar, sriracha remoulade, and spicy ketchup don't disappoint. They also offer dry rubs and unique toppings like bacon jam and truffled shallot aioli.  My husband's favorite part about burgatory is the dessert. Whether it's the Campfire S'mores shake or Ginormous chocolate chip cookie sundae  (which has has eaten by myself), you can't go wrong. Enjoy!  So why 3 stars? I will say that the north shore location's service isn't as stellar as the original Fox Chapel location. Bar service is slow and they messed up my order (which was for an allergy... serious stuff). Otherwise, still delicious. We did have to constantly ask for drink refills, even water. He never automatically filled our drinks. This would never happen at the Fox Chapel location!",

    "text": "Where do I even begin... This place shouldn't even be a reference to Purgatory because their milkshakes are HEAVEN. The Nutter Butter flavor is the best one they have by a long shot. As for the heavier fare, they offer small plates/appetizers as well as wings and burgers (the main event). Typically, red meat is not my favorite protein choice, but for Burgatory burgers I always make an exception. They have a plethora of toppings and each burger is totally customizable. Want peanut butter and pickles on a pretzel bun? Consider it done. The service is always great and I have never had a bad experience. The North Shore location is perfect for a bite to eat after a long day of singing Sweet Caroline and Hailing to Pitt at Heinz Field.",

    "text": "One of my favorites! I'm a vegan and my boyfriend is not so this is one of our favorite spots! I've visited the North Shore and Waterfront locations and both are great. We recently went about an hour before a Pirates game was due to start. We worried that it would be overly crowded but we were seated immediately (they use the nowait app so it's easy to check when to show up). The restaurant was full but service was still good and our food showed up without delay. The waitstaff are friendly and in my experience they know a lot about the menu and can help you navigate dietary restrictions.  Their veggie burgers are SO GOOD. You can tell they actually care about putting out a good option for everyone--not just slapping together a frozen patty and some lettuce. They even offer vegan milkshakes. They don't come in all the fancy varieties that the milk based ones do--but they are still an awesome treat and I'm glad they added it to the menu.  I usually go for the make your own burger option. The only drawback is they upcharge for many things that would come standard elsewhere. A burger that starts out at $9.5 can easily become a $14 meal. It's definitely worth the expense but I am always sore about paying extra for vegan cheese. All in all it's a great place, not crazy expensive, lots of taste and really nice people. I love coming back.",

    "text": "Went here with a friend to try out their burgers and milkshakes.  I've heard a lot of great things about them and finally got a chance to try it.  The restaurant is fairly large with a nice modern feel to it. It was fairly crowded in there for it being a Wednesday night which was good to see.  We ordered fries with parmesan cheese for an appetizer and those were fairly decent.  I had a burger and some deviled egg potatoes.  I absolutely love deviled eggs but really didn't find the potatoes that great as there wasn't really much taste to them.  The burger looked really good but turned out to be extremely greasy to the point where it made the bottom bun soggy and fall apart which really kind of ruined the burger for me. Lastly had a milkshake which was the best part. Definitely SPLIT the MILKSHAKE! They are HUGE!  If I ever come back it would be for a milkshake.  The menu is appealing to read but the food was rather disappointing.  I think there are plenty of places to get better burgers in Pittsburgh.",

They have a menu but it's really about building your own burger from a large selection of different meats, buns, cheeses, rubs, dressings, and other toppings.  My burger came out perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious!  And the fries, the fries are not to missed!   They were probably the best restaurant fries I've ever had.   Pricing is around what you would expect for a custom burger joint.  My son and I went and is was around $35 for two burgers w/fries, a beer, and a soda.",

    "text": "Overall, I am a fan of this place. It is a super close walk to Heinz Field. Also has a ton of TVs, so you won't miss any of the game no matter where you're sitting. Also, the food is pretty on point. I ordered the meat packer burger, which I was not a huge fan of. I feel like it just didn't have a lot of flavor. I think next time I will try the create your own burger.  All burgers come with a side of hand made there potato chips. They were pretty good but I ordered a side of ranch dressing to help the flavor a little bit. And that cost me $.75. I think it's dumb when restaurants charge for dressings (unless someone is ordering 10 of them to go).  I also tried the caramel pretzel milkshake. I did really enjoy that, it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet, just like the description says. Their whipped cream was very creamy and not watery (which I feel like a lot of places have that issue).  This is not the only location for Burgatory. I do enjoy their extensive list of creating your own burgers. And their milkshakes taste fresh. Worth a go if you are a burger and milkshake fan.  Your check will come with a fortune cookie. I thought that was really neat, until I opened it and all it said was \"buy the person on your left a milkshake\" - So kind of cute but overall wasn't as awesome as I originally thought.",

Got a great booth so that both of us could see the game clearly on the side of the bar.   We started with the Mike's scratch margarita-BF had the reg one I added jalapenos. It was ok.   Next we got the nachos & we inhaled them. So good!! I think there was chili on them but not sure. I really enjoyed them & felt the toppings were ample.   I tried the Rosemary's smash gin & cucumber drink next & it was so yummy!! I had about 5 more :)  My BF tried the Killer P & kept ordering them.  I had the Morton's Steakhouse, loved it. By the time I got my burger I was pretty drunk so I can't go in to too much detail cuz I don't remember :)  BF did a customer burger & ate it in 3 bites so that's a good sign lol.

I would recommend sticking to one of their signature burgers, trust me they know what they're doing!   The deep fried ribs appetizer is out of this world! I believe its called \"when pigs fry\" It recently replaced my old favorite appetizer the deep fried portobello mushrooms womp womp. I was a little bummed out until I tried the replacement, I no longer miss the mushrooms!   Make sure you save room for a milkshake because they are the final touch to this nearly perfect meal!

Our server was so attentive and sensitive to vegan dietary needs, and informed me that their chips and fries are fried with the same grease as the burgers, so I should avoid those. I enjoyed the side salad with a zesty apple cider vinaigrette instead, and I was happy to do so.

Still stands True even though I appreciate Burgatory's creativity with the theme, name of their entrees and overall ambience. Their service is slow though - from taking our orders (yes we were a large party but he didn't come check on us until we were seated for 10-15 mins and we were 1 of 2 parties in the entire restaurant.). It took almost 30 minutes to wave him down, get the check and for him to return -- the waiters weren't as attentive as I'd have liked them to be. I got the Nutella Crunch shake and I thought it was OK. A bit too grainy, would have liked it a little smoother but the Cookie Monster was pretty good so it made up for it. Got their chicken burger but it wasn't anything too memorable. Chicken was half dry half juicy, toppings were bland.",

When we first walked in, the hostess didn't greet us, she just started walking away and then turn around and was like \"ya'll can come.\" It was a Saturday at 9, but we got the vibe that she didn't want to be there.   The server was ok. She got our food order correct so good enough for me.  The milkshake - i cant remember the name but it had khalua, chocolate, and caramel - was really tasty. However, you can ask for a virgin one cause it's not much alcohol used.   The burgers were delicious and filling. My husband and I both had leftovers to bring home.   Overall, great if you just want a good burger and don't care about the service.",

I built my own -- pretzel bun, dry-aged wagyu beef, angel dust rub (garlic powder, salt, peppter), Truffled Shallot Aioli sauce, English cucumber, tomato, Aged Gruyere.  Chose pink (vs. no pink or red for cooked options).  This baby was messy but no worries because lots of napkins were provided.  The taste was melt-in-your-mouth juicy salty goodness, every last bite as I was licking my fingers.  Sometimes I've found that fancy-schmanzy burgers leave something to be desired because there is just too much going on, but this one?  Ohhh, man.  It hit every last spot on the inside from the roof of my mouth all the way down to my toes, I think.  For a side, I selected the Napa slaw. I want this recipe.  It's just the right tangy mess to go with my burger.    Alas, no room left for a milkshake.  Next time!",

I wanted to make sure I wrote a review for this location, though, because it was all that and more. They did an amazing job managing a HUGE post-marathon crowd. Many of the other diners were cranky and impatient, and I never heard one snarky comment from the staff at Burgatory. They delivered service with smiles and courteousness. Great work!",

On a whirlwind, food-filled trip to Pittsburgh, I demanded burgers and my friend suggested we go here. My friend is a freakin' genius. I took one look at the menu and immediately knew I had to have the Piggy Butter Jelly burger. It's a ground beef and ground bacon burger with candied bacon, peanut butter, habanero jelly, white cheddar, and bread and butter pickles. That is so many things I love put together into one glorious burger! It was everything I could have dreamed of and more. The habanero jelly really added a great kick to the burger and the candied bacon offset the savory portions and oh man. Oh man oh man oh man. I want it again so bad.  For dessert, I proclaimed, \"I'm on vacation, suckers!\" and ordered the Eclair Don't Care hard shake. It was HUGE. It was delicious and I'm sorry to see it's not still on the menu online. (However, there is one that involves an actual doughnut now, and that looks really interesting...) It was a delight and I would get one again if I could.   The cocktail I had, Strawberry Basil Shag, was fine, but nothing special. My alcohol was better served in a shake.",

I had the Pig and Jelly burger which has a super thick patty (bacon baked right in), candied bacon, jalepeno jelly, and peanut butter. I know it sounds crazy, but it so worked. I loved every bite. A friend and I shared one of the shakes. It was good but NOT great. Not worth the $6. The burger and fries on the other hand hit the spot. Just wish they had sweet taters. I'd go back.",

Reminded me of Leinie's summer shandy with a little less carbonation. Services was great, food was great, and good atmosphere. Everything youd like for a burger joint. 5 stars! Highly recommend if you've never been to a Burgatory.",

The north shore location is HORRIBLE. They told us they are owned by the same people so if I'm going to be disrespected by an apparent district manager I will make sure my family and I will no longer conduct business with Burgatory I work with many customers and refer their business as one of best burger places in town but no longer!!! Absolutely horrible do not recommend the north shore location at all!!! Horrendous customer service!",

The location was great. Walking distance from the huge \"Mr. Rogers\" statue and near the football stadium.   Seeng how this place is known for its burgers and shakes, I automatically thought of Shake Shack being from New York. This place however is like Shake Shack for the big kids. For starters I ordered a spiked milkshake,  the burnt almond. It was by far the best milkshake I have ever had!!! I honestly could have left this place without ordered another thing and still would have been happy. For starters we ordered onion rings and wings. The wings were absolutely delicious, but the onion rings Icould have gone without. I ordered the Buffalo cheddar burger and my friends chose to create their own burgers. That option was pretty cool, they have a notepad with all the burger options and then just check off what they wanted.  With every burger you have to choose pink or no pink. I personally prefer to get my burgers medium well, but nothing less the burger was still very good. When I come back to Pittsburgh I will definitely make another visit to Burgatory",

Don't overlook the apps either- we tried the fries that come topped with short ribs, gravy, and cheese curds- gourmet poutine for those familiar with the Canadian dish- I'm going to be dreaming about that dish until I can get back to Pittsburgh again. We were so full that we couldn't sample one of the amazing looking shakes but that's definitely on the list to try next time. They also have a great kids menu.",

Properly cooked (you build your own from a plentiful checklist of options) and presented, the flavor was better than average. I would give four stars, but the chips that accompanied the burger were kind of stale and a bit greasy. 3.5 stars from me, but the site requires whole numbers, so I went with three.",

The waitstaff is lively, on top of orders and drinks, knowledgeable of the menu, and a bit cheeky. Even the most outlandish menu items are surprisingly delicious and not just a chef's joke on patrons. :) If it sounds weird, give it a try...the flavor/texture combinations are more expertly thought-out than one would anticipate from a burger joint! I recommend the PB&J burger with a toasted s'more milkshake! Don't plan on finishing it, though :D",

I very politely asked, \"ok, for future reference, what time do you guys accept takeout orders until?\" (I tend to workout late and don't get to my hotel til later in the evening) She told me 950pm. I then said, \"so I can still order or I can't?\" She then proceeded to tell me that I was an inconsiderate person for trying to place a takeout order BEFORE their takeout orders ended, gave me a ton of attitude and said she guessed she could connect me to the bar to place my order.   Are restaurants no longer in the service industry?? I feel like I'm on a different planet. I didn't even say anything while she was berating me and hung up before I connected to the bar staff. I'll give my money to another one of Pittsburgh's million other restaurants instead if that's the type of person they put in a customer-facing position. I guess it's ironic that I felt like I was in purgatory while dealing with this staff member at Burgatory..",

I wanted to see Heinz Field and Burgatory was on the same street about a minute's walk away so it was perfect. The restaurant wasn't too busy so everything was smooth sailing. The service was spot on too. My waitress was really nice and attentive.  I ordered from their weekday lunch menu and got the crispy chicken sandwich ($8.50). It was delicious. The sandwich was hot and fresh and packed with this tangy slaw that worked really well with the fried chicken. Might be too tangy for some people, especially since they put pickles in the sandwich too, but I liked it since it provided a nice balance to the fried chicken. The sandwich also came with a side of chips, which weren't bad but I prefer fries. The chips were also slightly overseasoned so they were a bit salty for my taste, but minor things to be honest. Overall, it was a great dining experience. I would definitely eat at Burgatory again if I'm ever in Pittsburgh in the future!",

    "text": "I've never had such an awful experience at Burgatory. This is the first time that I've been to this location & I 100% will never come back here. Whenever we walked in, we had to say hello to get the girls at the counter to notice us.   Once were seated & ready to order, the waitress took my order & walked away completely forgetting to take my boyfriend's order & we had to say \"HEY\" do get her to come back. We both ordered Impossible Burgers. My boyfriend had one last week & said it was really good (He's a meat eater).    When they were brought out to us, they were cold all the way through so we asked for new ones. The waitress brought them back & said \"They threw them back on the grill\". Why not make fresh ones? We were so hungry that we let it slide and when we started eating the burgers just fell apart completely. We opened our buns to find that they had smashed the crap out of the burgers, pieces broke off & they just piled them on top. It wasn't even the shape of a burger anymore. His burger had hardened food from the grill on it. A complete mess.   We told the waitress that the burgers weren't right & she said, \"ill get a manager to talk to you about it\". We watched her walk to the manager, talk for 5 minutes, the manager walked to the back & eventually came out.    The manager argued that there was nothing wrong with the burgers & that sometimes if they leave them on the grill for too long, the seasoning burns & that's what the grill crud was.... I cook... that was not burnt seasoning. She asked if we'd like new burgers...  FOR THE THIRD TIME?? I DON'T THINK SO. We told her we lost our appetites and she just said, \"ok\" and just walked away from us.  Not a single apology. I've never left a restaraunt without paying until that moment. PLEASE, someone, get that place under control. Burgatory is amazing & this location is doing a great disservice to their business.",

Now I'm a vegetarian and I love their vegan veggie burger, vegan cheddar and their amazing vegan shakes! They're super accommodating with my veg needs! TODAY for the first time I had their IMPOSSIBLE burger! It was so delicious and literally tasted EXACTLY like beef! It was crazy! We had their BOD with pickles, lettuce, mayo and vegan cheddar! It was delicious!  Their shakes are amazing! When I eat dairy, I love their caramel pretzel shake. Ooh it's tasty! I love vegan Oreo shake and the dunkaroos one!

For an appetizer we ordered the gravy fries and cheese curd without braised pork. So good. For my entree I got their house veggie burger. The bun tasted fresh and really made for a great burger. Really good portions. Ordered my son a grilled cheese which I tried. The bread was buttery and grilled perfectly.  I shouldn't have, but I had to order the s'mores milkshake for dessert. It was super good.   My only gripe, which isn't their fault was finding a decent parking space. The walk near the water and view of downtown Pittsburgh was a great end to the night as well. Very nice location.  Would recommend giving this place try.",

The build your own burger option gives you the option to make it exactly how you want it down to the patty, bun, seasons, sauces, and toppings.   On top of the awesome burgers they have a pretty solid happy hour. They have some discount appetizers and drinks. I personally LOVE the basil shag. It's so refreshing that it's hard not to have multiple. The nachos are also delicious and that's coming from a major nacho snob. So trust me on this one!",

We couldn't pick a place so I recommended Burgatory. Thank the lord that I did. There we no wait on a Friday night, and we easily for a seat as the place was not that busy at all. The format of ordering food is just like Wich Wich and Stackd. The menu is a bit confusing as they have many rubs and sauces, which have no explanations. Thankfully, our server was very nice in helping us know what went into each sauce and rub. The extras were very appealing, but can get real expensive if you get a lot. Surprisingly, the wait for our food took longer than we thought but it was worth it. The burgers looked majestic and huge. Every ingredient was amazing. I wish the rub on the burgers had more flavor as it did not make the meat taste much different. I'm happy that I subbed the chips for the fries. It easily filled both of us up. This was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had before. I know I have to come again to try different rubs and sauces and even the different types of meat. Also have to make sure to leave some room for a shake.",

Now we know why!!!  We had a group of 4 and our waitress was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. Being as it was our first visit we had no idea where to start so she suggested doing the Custom Creation; where we custom build the burger from the meat(Hormone Free Beef, All Natural Chicken, Natural Bison, Dry Aged Wagyu, Wild Crab, Grass Fed Elk, Fiddy-Fiddy, Vegan Veggie and the Impossible Burger), bun, cheese, rubs & sauce and toppings.   Even thought it was very busy and the waitress had other customers to take care of, she made sure to take the time to help each one of us to craft the perfect burger that we wanted and answer a thousand little questions.  I can gladly say that each of our burgers were wonderful and delicious.   We each ordered different types of drinks. I tried the Cotton Candy Old Fashion, I like trying different takes on this drink and this one was a pleasant surprise as it's served with a little show. It was so good, I ordered a second one.   After this visit, we can't wait to return to Pittsburgh, so we can go to Burgatory.",

However if your looking for that ultimate burger experience Burgatory should be on your bucket list. To start off it's very similar to build a bear. Start with the stuffing (the protein), I chose the Elk. Then pick you rub, sauces, toppings and then finish off the masterpiece with the body. I went with the Pretzel roll. Super delicious. The prices are slightly higher than a typical burger joint, but this is not typical. Wide selection of adult beverages to include adult shakes. Definitely a great place to go while in Pittsburgh",

I got a beef burger and it was huge, normally I don't like thick burgers but this one had great flavor and was cooked well (no pun intended) throughout, so I didn't mind. I also upgraded to fries as a side, normally it comes with chips.  I also got the Caramel Pretzel milkshake and it was decent. I was really excited to try the milkshakes after reading so many great reviews, and while this one had good flavor it was a bit too thick and had too much pretzel. Way too many pretzels ground up in there for my taste.  This was a pretty good lunch spot. The burgers were great and the milkshake was decent. Service was fast and friendly and the ambiance was nice, too. I would definitely come back!",

Also, there is every topping you can think of as well as seasonings for the burgers, a variety of cheeses (buffalo cheddar is life), and different bun selections. We also split an order of nachos. They have the perfect balance of a hint of spice with chili, cheese, and a variety of toppings. The milkshakes are to die for! Huge, delicious, and if it's your birthday you get a free one when you join their mailing list (I joined while sitting at the table).",

The angel dust rub was awesome. There is a $1.50 up-charge to get French fries instead of their homemade chips. However, I got the chips & they were actually really good.

Since I'm not a huge red meat lover, I do love building a ground chicken burger. They are so good. Also surprisingly enough, their nachos are awesome. They come with chili, quac, and some sort of chipotle cream stuff that's delicious.   I also enjoy their happy hour specials. Very good deals if you can make it in time.

The onion rings were massive. Pretty tasty and the dips that come along are flavorful. I love that they do build your own burgers! The creations on the menu sound incredible. I was tempting by the crab burger but stuck with my salad. I got the grilled chicken salad without bacon, cheese,egg or croutons. I know I'm a buzz kill. The dressing that came with it was delicious. Only downside was the avocado they put on it. It wasn't ripe at all. Very hard trying to bite into it. You think that's pretty obvious when you cut it but hey things happen. I saw that they offer vegan milkshakes. I'm pretty excited to go back and try one. It's been a long time since I've had a shake.

    "text": "TexasTripletMom's Best Burger in America List - Ranking #1  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am a well reputed burger aficionado. In a word i'm a burger snob. Be it greasy spoon or gourmet i'm on a perpetual hunt of the best burger in America. That illusive cheeseburger is my Moby Dick. And Burgatory is #1 on the top ten burger list, that I update as I travel across the USA for work and pleasure. Burgatory's Burger is the white whale of burgers.  You must understand, to be top ten worthy -- a burger really must impress. It must cause unmitigated joy - a giant grin - and compulsive participation in what I call \"The happy burger dance\". It must have me pining and longing and craving for it long after it's gone. I longly stare at its pictures and wonder when will it ever call. It haunts me. It makes me hungry. It coaxes me and teases me to buy a plane ticket to visit it once more. I dream about eating it again. Only the best burgers make the list. And the Burgatory burgers are no slouch. They are the ultimate burger experience.  Exceptional ingredients (the best most flavorful meat seasoned and cooked to perfection), amusing combinations (like a bacon beef patty blend, habanero jelly, peanut butter, and a fried egg which was amazing), and tons of a-la-carte options (which of more than 24 rubs and sauces would you prefer? Are you a spring mix, romaine, or iceburg lettuce type? You have a choice of meats, cheeses, buns, --- you can load up with no lie -- 4 kinds of bacon on a single burger). The sky is the limit. But you do pay per item for some of the ingredients.  Though I indisputably adore the flavors, quality, and service one of my favorite things about burgatory is the variety. Because of the wide variety of savory options --- I can go one day and play with a sweet and spicy mixture of jalapeno-pineapple, ham - and the next and try something sassy like arugula brie and a coffee rub. I become a gourmet burger chef by ordering up a new creation ... but without all the fuss of having to make fresh carmelized onions and a daily batch of bacon jam. And it gives me a an accessible approach to eating a FABULOUS cheese burger three or even five days a week without ever getting bored.  I've been to three locations, all of them fabulous. The service is exceptional. The Burgers devine, and the decor amusing/whimsical.   My go to is waygu beef, brioche bun, apple wood smoke bacon, onion jam, bread and butter pickles, with a Cajun rub, and spring mix lettuce.",

I ordered a Medium Buffalo burger with smoked Gouda cheese, the Diablo rub, onions, pickles, jalapenos, and organic field greens. My burger was cooked perfectly. Not rare, but also not well done. The perfect medium, but a bit more on the rare side. I also got the bourbon BBQ sauce on the side. It was really good! I don't usually order BBQ because I'm more of a spicy person. The Diablo rub made up for the lack of hot sauce. It had a kick to it! Loved it.   The burger came with chips on the side. You could have subbed them for a different side for a small cost. I elected to stay with the chips. I wish they had a seasoning on them though. I added some salt and pepper, but they were still missing something.   Overall, I really liked my burger and would definitely come back again :)",

    "text": "Burgatory has been my go-to burger and milkshake joint for quite some time. The staff has always been friendly at whichever location I visit, the establishment is clean, and the ambiance fits perfectly for a place called \"Burgatory.\"  I always opt for the \"Build Your Own Burger\" selection since you can customize every aspect of your burger from its bun down to the spice rub they use on the patty. I love that they give you so many options just for the bun, but I usually stick with the standard brioche bun - it's soft, toasted, and it's large enough to contain all your burger toppings.   As for the patty, you have several different options. You can't go wrong with a typical beef patty, which is cooked to your liking (pink, some pink, or no pink). If you opt for the chicken patty, the server will usually ask if you would like a chicken breast patty or a ground chicken patty. I've tried both but slightly prefer the ground chicken patty over the chicken breast mainly because the rubs are integrated a bit better in the patty than in the chicken breast.   I've sampled a few of the different rubs during my visits, and I've been drawn to the Diablo Dust rub the most. It gives the burger just a little bit of distinctive heat, and it's the one you can actually tell is mixed into your burger (or sprinkled on top if you opt for a chicken breast patty). Some of the rub names are a bit confusing, as it's difficult to tell what's actually in the spice blend (ex: Angel Dust = salt and pepper), but the servers are more than happy to explain the entire menu to you.   My favorite sauce is probably their \"House Sauce,\" which is a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise. I always write \"sauce on the side\" on my order form since I love dipping my chips in the sauce (which are homemade, thick-cut, crispy, and amazing). The few times I've opted for their fries over their chips, I've received slightly flimsy fries, so I prefer the crispier chips. Feel free to pick whatever toppings you like. Their jalapenos are spicy, the bacon is crispy, the grilled onions are sweet and perfectly caramelized, the fried egg is served up sunny side up, and all other toppings are plentiful, so prepare for a messy yet delicious burger.  On to the shakes...oh my the shakes. They are by far some of the best milkshakes I've had. My favorites are the Cookie Monster milkshake and the spiked Espresso Love milkshake. You can ask them to add whatever alcohol you prefer to non-alcoholic milkshakes, and they can always make their alcoholic milkshakes without alcohol. All of their milkshakes come topped with a generous serving of whipped cream and their own garnishes. They're definitely large enough to split with someone else, but typically they won't split the milkshake for you. They'll be more than happy to bring you another glass and straw, but it's up to you if you want to attempt to split the milkshake in half. You're probably better off using two straws in the original glass. Sometimes, you'll get lucky and they'll actually split the milkshake into two separate glasses, but it has only been done once out of the several times I've visited - it's always worth asking, though.   Burgatory will leave you stuffed, smiling, and perhaps feeling a little bit \"bleh\" afterwards, but it's always worth it.",

They came out only about 45 seconds after I placed the order. I asked him, are these extra crispy? The manager made up some ridiculous story about how fresh cut fries can't be cooked extra crispy and that these fries were put down for extra time. I laughed at him and he took the order back to have it done again. After a few minutes some extra crispy fries came out.  Incompetent manager, otherwise great service from the server.",

    "text": "We came, we saw, we ate.   Our group decided to eat at the bar in lieu of waiting 20-30 minutes for a table.  We were served by a couple (tag team) of excellent bartenders who provided great advice.  Food:  Appetizer  Our group made the decision to split the Impossible Burger and some onion rings.  The onion rings were awesome.   Nice thick coat of batter, large slices of onions.  What is not to like?  The Impossible Burger had a mixed review with our group.   The carnivores in our group that ordered (The Farmer Brown and a customer Dry Aged Wagyu) were not as keen on the burger.   I like the Impossible Burger - to me, it tasted like a burger with potato chips (mashed on top of the patty). That is probably because the impossible burger's texture is from potato I believe.   It did have a \"meat\" taste from Heme (protein).   I think it is a good alternative if I want a lower calorie meat flavored item.  Dinner / Main Meal  I decided to go off the beaten path and ordered The Crab Shack (a very large crab cake on a bun).  Our bartender recommended the Angel Dust Rub, Amish Gorgonzola, and Truffle Shallot Aioli.  The Crab Shack was soft and delicious with the right additions.  I liked it so much that I offered samples to my group and they thought it was a hit as well.  The restaurant is in the thick of it on the North Shore.   Great vibe.  Great Service.  Great Recommendations.  I will be back.",

May have been because it was cooked medium or may have just been the type of meat. In the future I might try the bison burger or the elk again but ask for it medium-rare. The menu is basically all burgers though so if you aren't going to order a burger do not come here.",

The side of bacon was huge, good quality bacon.  The house chips are quite good, thickly cut potato chips, and not too salty, the French fries are hand cut with the skins on.  The bomb and the talk of our lunch was the impossible burger. That thing was unbelievable. It tastes just like beef!!  I cannot wait to go back and have another one. I don't know the best place to park, but I did park in the metered spaces in front of the restaurant.  Our waitress, Chevelle, was awesome. We never waited for anything, and she didn't overstay her welcome.  The restrooms were clean, but they were out of TP and hand towels.  Still, the impossible burger was so good, I overlooked the little things.  :-)",

    "text": "Went on Saturday afternoon with my wife before a concert.  The location is perfect between the ballpark and stadium downtown.  I got in line on the Yelp app.  I had 40 minutes or so to check in the app said with 20 parties ahead of me.  We arrived just after the recommended time to check in.  We were told it would be another 20 minutes for a table.  It was more like a little less than 10 minutes.  I got a phone call and text at the same time when our table was ready.  What an awesome system!!  As busy as they were we had excellent service.  The onion rings came out less than 5 minutes after we ordered them with a spicy ketchup and horseradish dip.  The horseradish dip had too much horseradish in it.  The spicy ketchup was perfect.  A little kick, but not too hot.  The onions were piping hot and were huge.  We couldn't finish them all.  After trying the spicy ketchup I decided to keep the spicy theme going.  I created a spicy burger for myself.  Hormone free beef on brioche.  Diablo dust, Honey Habanero sauce, jalapeno, onion, dill pickle, and romaine lettuce.  Cooked a perfect pink edge to edge.  Was juicy as heck and I can't say enough how hot it was!  Simply delicious.  I ordered fries and kept the leftover spicy ketchup from the onion rings.  Fries were good.  Just lukewarm.  Must have been sitting a bit before being put on my plate.  Food was really good.  Service was top notch and moved quickly.  Especially since a concert was going on less than 2 hours after we were there.  I'd go back again any time.",

With such a huge list of ingredients, it's fun to experiment with the different combinations. :) I like that the burgers here are meaty and fresh, although the buns and fries can sometimes be a bit too soggy. Come for happy hour M-F 5-7pm and you can get... $5 drafts, apps, and cocktails woohoo! I wasn't blown away by the cocktails, which were pretty standard, but I did like the wings. Tangy with a good kick, although a bit lacking in crispness. I guess there can be a problem here with textures sometimes haha. Regardless - - quality burgers and beers plus an awesome wait staff and chill vibes make Burgatory a great experience!",

    "text": "So this particular location (it's a local chain) is located between PNC Park and Heinz Field. Perfect location to draw in all of those sports fans. And, it worked, because it drew us to it before going on to watch a Pirates game. This is probably more of a touristy spot than where locals meet up, but that being said, it was much better than most chains/tourist spots. I decided to go out of the box and get something I wouldn't normally get. I ordered the Piggy Butter & Jelly Burger. It's a Burger with American cheese, candied bacon, bread and butter pickles, habanero jelly and a decent sized dab of peanut butter. If you're saying to yourself: \"that's a lot going on there\", you'd be right. I was a little worried about the Habanero jelly cause I'm a bit of a sissy when it comes to super spicy foods, but it was surprisingly actually on the mild side. The peanut butter drew me to this burger and it did not disappoint. The many different flavors blended really well on this burger to make each bite better than the last. The bacon was great, the peanut butter was smooth and creamy and the bread and butter pickles topped it all off deliciously. I highly recommend this one. They serve the burgers with homemade potato chips that are great also, so no need to order fries unless you're super hungry or maybe sharing them. This place is chill and fun to hang out in. The service was good here as well. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back to Burgatory. I'm a little mad that they're not in Philly :)",

It seemed strange being that everyone else was seated closer to the bar area. It was also cold by the door. I mean it was only 14 degrees out. Our server was great. We each did a make your own burger. I had the chicken burger with a variety of toppings. It was good. Comes with chips for the side. They were okay too. My sister did get a free milkshake for her birthday. Must join the email club.   Over all the experience and atmosphere are great if you are looking for something causal or a place to watch the game. For the menu - think burgers and fries with a twist. You can pick pre-set burgers or completely construct your own. Toppings range from the typical lettuce, tomato and cheese to caramelized onions and a fried egg. Come with a big appetite!",

Service overall was pretty slow, so we try to do things as a group and on one occasion had to flag down the waiter to get the final checks. With regards to our food, I ordered a Trippin chicken sandwich, Nutella crunch's shake, and also substituted the chips for the fries. The chicken sandwich was good, but I wouldn't called spectacular. The flavor lacks something to be desired for, maybe a more flavorful mayo or dressing? The fries were not crispy and were a little soft. This movie though, was the real winner. It came with the extra leftovers on the side, and was delicious. Overall would return, but not my favorite chicken sandwich please.",

Seemed consistent for taste with the Waterworks Burgatory. Love that you can do the custom burger, and mostly do that. I got the chicken burger this time and it was really moist and tasty. Got the Eclair alcoholic milkshake, which was really good. Lots of eclair pieces in it, but I wish there was a little bit more chocolate. The fries were good, as always.   While not the best burgers in Pittsburgh, I love that they have a large variety for their make your own burger and their milkshakes are always amazing.",

The North Shore is sort of dead when there isn't a game going on, so I can see that being the case. I can definitely envision coming down here rather than going all the way out to Homestead or Aspinwall and fighting insane crowds.   I came here after running in the Great Race with my boyfriend and a college friend of his. We were immediately seated and given a table where we could see the game on the TV. For 1:00 pm on a Sunday everything was really efficient. Our server was super friendly and put in drink and food orders at once. I like how after you've been to Burgatory a few times the process becomes incredibly smooth. The draft list at this location was top-notch, with several imperial IPAs and fall beers to choose from. They even had Dogfish Head Punkin Ale on draft, which is a huge favorite of mine. Our food arrived in a timely manner, and everything was perfect like I've come to expect from Burgatory. There don't seem to be any serious new location kinks to be worked out, which is nice. Side note, I tried their guacamole for the first time and it was incredible! Definitely worth getting as an app while waiting for burgers.",

All of their mayo based sauces are made with mayo from a bulk distributor, so if you need hormone free eggs (I do because of allergies) you're out of luck. Service varies from decent to sketchy, lots of minor slips and confusion. Our server dumped sauce all over my pants. Finally, almost everything we ordered was very overcooked. My \"red\" burger was almost brown, fries were leathery, etc.  Now the GOOD: food itself is tasty. The wings are fried pretty hard and chewy, but the flavors are solid. Same goes for the onion rings. The burgers are the highlight, of course. Just wish they were prepared as ordered.  If you can get past the discomfort factor -- might not be so bad when weather is cool -- it's a decent choice for classic American food.",

I expect that they will switch up the vegan burger and shake option every week or month. Unfortunately, the black bean burger was not gluten free, womp womp...  Just when I thought I was out of luck, the waitress brought me the gluten free menu. They had gluten free AND vegan options on this special menu! What a delight! I decided to get the naked (no bun...even though they DO offer gluten free buns!) portobello mushroom with an onion dust, tomato, onion, cucumber, avocado, and a Sriracha glaze. Instead of chips, I got the Quinoa salad. There wasn't a description of the Quinoa salad on the menu so I didn't realize it came with feta cheese on top. Not a huge deal, it was easy to take off. The Quinoa salad was quinoa, peppers, onion and spices tossed in a light vinaigrette. Tasty side dish & a plentiful portion size. My favorite part of the meal was by far the onion dust on the portobello mushroom! Slightly crunchy on the outside and the flavor seeped through into the warm, soft middle of the shroom. I will get a dust on my portobello burger every time I'm there! I would have liked a few more avocado slices (a few thin slivers is never enough) and a spicier Sriracha glaze would have given the burger the perfect punch. I understand making the glaze mild for those patrons who have a weak tolerance for spicy food.   We didn't have any issues with our waitress. She was friendly, attentive and made great suggestions about the food. She was quite good at up-selling, I'll give her that!   The layout of the restaurant is standard Burgatory and what you'd expect. Clean and spacious- no complaints from our group! We'll be back!",

She was friendly but didn't really pay any attention to us, our food took forever, I ordered the Rosemarie cocktail the first one was great so I ordered another but the second one was different!? No cucumber WAY too sweet just inconsistent. Not only that but all the servers where lounging around socializing waiting for the food to come out, it's like is this social hour? Can I get some water and a refill?  Also our bartender bounced out right when we were finished with our meal, no word just grabbed her coat and left? Ok bye? Lol So we waited like 20 min just for the bill and when it came it was disappointing. Too much for this place. NOT worth the price. Never coming back. Un enjoyable. Get your shit together. Boooooo",

I enjoyed the light casual feel of the design along with modern contemporary flare. The food: The customization of the burger puts the power in your hands to create a masterpiece burger.

However, my friend asked for medium and the burger came out extremely pink. We told our server Lacey and she didn't do anything  about it when we mentioned it to her. My friend only ate two bites of her meal and she still got charged for the $10 burger... also my friend got a lemonade and Lacey didn't mention that it wasn't free refills so he got charged for two. Overall I had a good experience, but my friend didn't... I would go back for the food maybe not for the service.",

In addition, they have an assortment of appetizers that are half off during happy hour including wings, Korean bbq ribs (delicious, although I don't know how authentic), and a version of poutine.  Burgatory is a great place to go with friends and just chill :) I love their cool, casual, and low-key edgy vibe and they always have great seating, whether indoors main, at the bar or outdoors patio.",

They were both cooked perfectly and prepared how I requested. The fries were decent but I prefer thin cut fries with more seasoning.  The deducted star came from the price. My customized burger, fries, and milkshake came out to over $30 with my tip. Seems a bit steep when I didn't add too many of the extra toppings.",

    "text": "Went here for a late lunch on a Saturday. We got seated right away and had a waiter come over to answer any questions/bring us water. I ordered the Elk gone wild burger with fries and my fiance ordered the Meat your maker burger with fries. The meat and toppings were great. Meat wasn't over cooked at all. I had ordered my burger medium and it felt more of a medium rare though. The only thing I didn't like about the burgers was that the bread ended up being very soggy after a few bites. The French fries were good. I liked the meat your maker burger though. For dessert, we shared a salted Nutella crunch milkshake. The milkshake was good. Next time I would order it without whipped cream because I thought it was too heavy with the milkshake. The portion sizes were very large, we left very full after our meal.   Service was a bit slow after we put our orders in. We had to go and get ketchup ourselves because the one at the table wasn't full and we couldn't find our waiter.   Overall I would try this place again but it won't be my go to burger place as I didn't like the bread becoming soggy after just a few bites.",

I bookmarked Burgatory for our Pirates game trip and there was no disappointment.   I had an undiscloseable amount of Yuengling on draft and the Piggy Butter & Jelly was the most strangely awesome thing that I have eaten in a long time. No joke, it's wonderful. Candied Bacon, peanut butter, habanero jelly, etc. on a burger, WHAT? So good!  Kids liked the mini burgers and quesadilla. My wife actually had an alcoholic milkshake (I was shocked) was really really good (choco taco milkshake).   A bit higher than most places we go but it was awesome. Local to Pittsburgh with 6 locations and soon to be 7. GO THERE!",

When runners brought food they waited for us to move our used appetizer dishes so they could put down food, but then never took the dishes.

Being uninitiated to the place, it would have been nice to know from the server that you have to specifically order other add-ons like lettuce, tomato, onions or whatever as they are not provided otherwise. I mean, if you're going to charge me $100.00 ($120 with tip) for 6 burgers and soft drinks...what the heck...go the extra mile, talk a little, make sure your customers know what the location customs are. Oh...and the chips were below par...if they are made on site you need a more proficient hand at that wheel. For that price you should be providing fries anyway. I never mind spending money for an equivalent return in quality. I don't think I got it here.",

I was happy to find myself finally here in awesome company on a beautiful evening in July.  We sat on the patio and were almost instantly greeted by our server. She didn't mention her name, I don't think, but I might have been too worried about catching the stupid zubat across the street to hear her say it. (Darn Pokemon.)  She took our order quickly, and then came back with our waters. We got our food quickly, and ordered fries when the burgers arrived. The fries took forrreevvverrr. Like, done with my burger and waiting for the second coming of Christ, forever. Our server came over and wondered where they were, and disappeared. Ten minutes later she came back with them. Whatever. We ordered shakes when she dropped the fries off, and they took a good amount of time, especially with the diningroom being empty and only a few people outside and at the bar. But needless to say they were still amazing, and I downed mine quickly.  No matter what glitches, I'm sure I'll be back since this is the closest one to my house!   Happy Eating!",

My boyfriend is competing and got to eat a burger the night before the show so we were on a mission to find something amazing. Burglertory did not let us down! I had the crab burger. It was amazing. So perfectly crispy on the outside, not at all greasy as I expected and so much delicious crab just melting in your mouth. It was served on a white bun(I forgot to ask for a wheat bun and realized after we ordered you could get it on a pretzel bun). It comes with fries or chips but I asked for a side salad which was just as delicious... Mixed greens with fresh shaved gruyere(I think) and roasted tomatoes. Even my boyfriend loves the tomatoes (and he \"hates tomatoes\"). The boy got the meat your maker with the wagyu beef which was better than my crab burger. Omg it was so tender and juicy cooked to perfection. Topped with tomato, cheese, and a few other delicious things I can't remember. Even the fried were cooked to a crisp perfection!   Definitely happy with our choice of burger joint!  They had a ton a delicious looking shakes but Danny's coach only allowed him chocolate cake or cheese cake for dessert. Only other dessert they had was a chocolate chip cookie sundae so we skipped the dessert portion. Looked good though.",

I would highly recommend giving this place a try.   Service was amazing as well although it was 3:00 pm on a Tuesday so it is a pretty slow time in the restaurant industry. Our server, Conor B, was knowledgeable on the menu and very helpful with the tough choices if I must say so myself.

This was a take out order, the web sight made it easy to order a build your own burger. Portobello mushroom cap, whole wheat bun, truffled shallot aioli, angel dust, organic field greens, baby spinach, poblano peppers, and arugula with a side salad was my order. A coworker ordered the peanut butter and jelly burger, another, an order of wings.  They actually got the order right, something that is unusual for the north shore eateries. The burger was perfect as was peanut butter and jelly burger. My side salad was delicious. I've always been amazed at Burgatory's ways of making a simple side salad extra special. Even in a take out order!",

    "text": "My rating has two parts-the food and the service/way issue was handled.  The food: the food is awesome! I went with the create your own burger. It was like a chose your own adventure. So many options to chose from. I went with a burger that had grilled onions, horseradish cheese, garlic mayo and probably other things that I have forgotten all on a pretzel bun. The burger was excellent. I prefer my burgers well done and you know it's s good place when they can make a burger juicy and still have it well done. My wife went a pulled fork and cheese curd appetizer. I would call it an American version of poutine. The food was great!!!  The service/manager: first things first, the server was good-friendly, quick to refill beverages, and anything else you expect in a good server. My issue came when the bill arrived.  On their create a burger form there is a bottom part that says you get chips automatically but can sub the chips for something else and they provide you with a list and a price next to anything that would have an up charge. I went with the fries and added jalapeno cornbread. The server looked over the my form and headed to the back. No mention of any issues with it.  I receive my food, enjoy it, and get the bill. I notice on the fries that I substituted were $1.5 up charge (which is fine) and the cornbread (which the menu said was $1.5) shows $3.50. Call the waiter over and tell him the issues. He says, that you can only sub one item and that was the fries. The cornbread is charged at full menu price. I say, there is 1. No mention of that on the menu, 2. There is no mention of how much the full price is. He says he will get the manager. A couple minutes later a gentleman with crazy facial hair comes over. And explains to me the same thing the server said about the second item being charged full price. I state that is mentioned nowhere on the form or even what the full price would be. When I'm done he just stares at me. Waiting for me to admit defeat. After looking at each other for awhile I say, \"well I guess that's that then. Right?\" He says yes and that's how it ends.   If the menu had said that fine, that's on me. It didn't 1. Say what happens with additional sides or 2. How much they are. A real bait and switch.  I was disappointed with how the manager handled it. And therefore I give 5 stars on the food and 2 on the service. Not sure if I would go back just based on how the post meal went down.",

The nachos were soggy and had too many toppings to chip ratio, which ended in us not being able to even eat them. The jalapeno bacon fries were OK. Not as described on menu, had whole jalapenos just tossed with some fries. I will say that the pork belly tacos were outstanding. 3 street tacos with cilantro, grilled pineapple, and pickled red onion. Overall slightly disappointed because we heard great things, but also can't be too upset because we didn't even try the burgers - what they are known for. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for apps and drinks.",

The Pommes Frites, to die for, we did the Truffled Gorgonzola flavor. I could have eaten the whole tin by myself and been happy that was my meal.   Ultimately we did burgers and they were cooked just as we requested and very good but honestly nothing incredibly special or memorable until we asked our server what the rubs were and what works best with those. My wife would tell you, her burger was awesome and it's all because of the rub recommendation she got.     So what was truly memorable was our waitress. Service is something of a premium these days and Jennifer was one of the best we ever had. She was attentive, answered all our questions, and was as friendly as you could be, even after we told her we were here to cheer on the rival sports team. :)  When you go to Heinz Field or PNC Park (and you should a beautiful ballpark by the way), just down the block is the Burgatory.  Parking is easy on the street if you go early enough. Otherwise , if it's right before the game there is the lot right behind the restaurant. Use the west entrance (a little tip Jennifer gave us), that's for everyone parking not just leases.   I don't know that Pittsburgh would be somewhere we would frequent and these burger spots are only in the steel city but I do know if we do go back, we are going to Burgatory and asking for Jennifer.",

I had the Standard Deluxe burger which was cooked exactly how I wanted, it was very juicy, and the sauce they put on top was awesome-I didn't use any ketchup or mustard. The russet AND sweet potato chip combo was an unexpected twist that was absolutely delightful. I finished off my meal with a peanut butter shake that was light and fluffy and delicious and so large I had to put it in the freezer.   I would absolutely recommend this for anyone looking for an outstanding dinner. I quite literally made a Yelp account just to write this review.",

    "text": "He been twice this week this place  was so good. The first  time I came I got the elk burger. It  was simply amazing. Everything from the flavors to the textures to the smells... Insane. Has to be top 3 burgers. It was pricey, but probably on par with what you  would expect for a craft burger right next to a stadium. I got it with a side of the quinoa salad to feel less guilty.  Came back two days later because I was still thinking about their burger and wanted to try something else. Luckily during  happy  hour they have $5 apps, cocktails, and beer from 5-7. I ordered the  honey habanero wing and the  impossible  burger sliders for  $5 each. Amazing value! For the food quality though I'll be honest the wings were not that  good. The sauce  was good,  but  barely had any kick for  claiming to be habanero and  the  chicken  was  pretty dry, small, and tough in  places. The impossible  burger though.... Just  wow. I couldn't believe  it  has no meat in it! The  texture and taste are pretty damn  close to the real thing. Ii think I'd regular get this burger over your average  restaurant beef burger! So so so good.   Extra  special  thanks to the  folks behind the bar  who  were super  nice. They  checked  on  me often which  was  nice since the food does kind of  come out slow (but  well worth it). I will definitely be  back.",

Love that you can build your own burger with a variety of proteins, types of buns or bun less, a number of different cheeses, rubs, sauces and veggies. Also, you can choose the temp of your meat. Service was excellent as our server was able to recommend combos for create your own burgers. It was a little overwhelming to have so many options, but I opted for the Texas BBQ rub, smoked gouda, fried onion straws, lettuce, tomato, and garlic aioli mayo. It's also nice that you can choose your temperature as well on the beef.  They also have a wide selection of beer, as well as boozy milkshakes. Sad that the boozy milkshakes aren't available to go, but that's not Burgatory's fault!  Burgers are so tasty that we got on to go for a co-worker who opted to stay behind at the hotel and she said it was one of the best burgers she'd ever had, even though it was re-heated in her hotel room microwave.",

Just as a note, these burgers are huge so would not recommend getting 1 for each person unless you are confident you have the stomach space for it. 1. Standard Deluxe - It's like an In-N-Out burger except there is way more meat that happens to also be better quality. But in all honesty can we talk about the fries? Wow I loved the combination of the russet and sweet potato and the texture was on the harder side. Absolutely loved the crunch! 2. Trippin Chicken - This was the winner of the night. I absolutely loved the fried leeks on top because it added such a unique texture and flavor to the otherwise eh burger. The brie was also a really smart move.  Trippy Chicken for the win. But also if you don't feel like eating anything else, just get the fries - it is that good!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch around 1pm on a Friday. The place was packed, with people constantly floating in and out. The atmosphere is super casual, loud, TVs on the walls, a huge bar, multiple seating areas, booths and tables outside, people having fun.   The service is swift and friendly. I took my time with the order, so our waitress was visibly shocked and annoyed at how long it takes to make up my mind about a burger, but she remained calm and courteous throughout multiple check-ins at our table.   You have several options. Either order from a menu of pre-built plates, or build our own burger. I complied an interesting combination that didn't really work as well as I hoped.  I got the aged wagyu ($12.50) with magic mushroom rub, smoked gouda, mayo, iceberg lettuce, banana peppers, and pickles on a brioche bun. The patty itself was pretty delicious and juicy, was happy with the meat. The toppings combination, hoverer, didn't work as well. They put a LOT of pickles and banana peppers, so be aware! You can add multiple extra toppings like caramelized mushrooms, avocado, grilled pineapple, and bacon jam for $1-1.50 upcharge. I enjoyed the patty, but my sides didn't work for me and I was left a bit disappointed from the overall build your own burger experience.   Overall, the hype is definitely overdone, but it's a solid meal option, a good fit for anyone wanting something casual but unique to Pittsburgh.",

Also, I want to shout out to the manager & staff for being so cautious and concerned when my boyfriend forgot to mention his nut allergy until after his food was made (typical of him).

The atmosphere here before a game was super lively and fun, and I had a great experience. The food here is great! I ordered their classic burger and a Smores milkshake which was AMAZING! It was probably the best milkshake I've ever had. The service was great and overall I think this is such a great place to go when in Pittsburgh or when looking for some grub before kickoff!",

Luckily I wasn't in a rush because I ended up waiting 20 minutes for my food. The bartender was nice while I waited and the staff was polite, but having to wait that long when I put my order in almost an hour beforehand was a little frustrating.   I got a gluten free bun, they have very good gluten free options! And were good about the allergy. The bun was very good, had great texture and was nice and crispy when toasted. One of the best gluten free alternatives I've had so far. The burger itself had good flavor, but nothing special just average. They also forgot my spicy ketchup which was a little disappointing after waiting so long.   I will come back here in the future when I'm craving a burger.",

There is the option to customize and build your own burger if the options on the menu are not what you seek in a burger, but the burgers on the menu are for sure worth the try. We tried most of the burgers on the menu, despite the cries of our wallets.  The attention to detail inside to the decor is what really intrigued us, it had a nice industrial touch to the place!  Definitely worth the stop and if I lived in the area it would be a regular spot.",

A group and I came in on a Friday night at around 7:30 and we had to wait about 15 minutes, which wasn't as bad as I expected since the place was packed! Service was pretty good, she checked up on us right away and took our orders. Didnt see her much after that, but we really didnt need her to.  Highly recommend the burnt almond tort hard shake if you are visiting from out-of-town, as I was told that the Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte was a must-try! I didnt have a chance to get the torte itself, so the hard shake had to suffice. It was sweet and delicious, and a nice big serving.   For the burger, I got the Meat Your Maker and it was honestly worth!! The wagyu beef and sweet onion crust gave a lot of flavor. I didnt taste the truffled shallot aioli so much, but that might have been a good thing.",

So after 36 hours of gluttonous bliss that preceded our visit to this spot and just when I thought I couldn't possibly eat another burger, my wife recommended we check this place out.  We chose this location due to its close proximity to the National Aviary (review coming soon). After all, who wouldn't want to devour some meat after looking at 700 birds for 3 hours?!?!  Anyway, once again, and I guess to no one's surprise based on the name of this place, I found another incredible and memorable burger - Meat Your Maker.  I recall that the description mentions that after eating this delight, you will feel like you're in heaven...and after some excitement and moaning, I tend to agree with that description.  Their homemade chips could use some work though.  My wife had the Crabshack which was tasty and my daughter had the hot dog which she crushed.  The cocktails were unique and delicious.  Then, to finish things off and put a big ol' fat exclamation point on the weekend, we split a milkshake...the one with Nutella and Hershey's Crunch Bars.  Damn, that was ridic!    The waitress was nice but lacked much personality.  I'll definitely be back though.",

    "text": "I was on the North Shore last night and was looking for dinner after going to the 21+ night at the Carnegie Science Center.  Given that I'd seen a few photos posted from this new Burgatory in the past couple of days, I knew it was finally open, so I decided to check it out.    Having been to the Waterworks and Waterfront branches, I knew what to expect, and fortunately, this Burgatory delivered.  My dining partner and I started by splitting a cookie monster shake.  It was delicious, with lots of cookie chunks, and provided just the right amount for both of us.  The kitchen also honored my request to go light on the whipped cream, an option I recommend if you don't like mounds of whipped cream on your shake.  For our burgers, we both opted for custom burgers, since this is what Burgatory is known for.  I had the crab burger on a pretzel bun with the cajun rub, grilled pineapple, truffled shallot aioli, tomato, and arugula.  While the crab patty was decent in flavor, it was quite soft, making it a bit awkward to eat on a burger.  The flavor of the grilled pineapple complemented it nicely, though the juice made the crab patty a bit soggy after biting into it.  While it wasn't a bad burger, I prefer the chicken burger I had last time due to its firmness.  My dining partner had the fifty-fifty burger, which comes out looking pink despite being well-done.  Since he chose the options, I don't remember all of them, but I know he got it on herbed focaccia and with field greens, cucumber, and onions.  He enjoyed his burger very much.  Surprisingly, we were able to get seated without any wait whatsoever--a rarity at Burgatory.  I'm guessing this is because people don't realize that this branch is open yet, so enjoy it while you can.  Our service was excellent, with our waitress stopping to check on us at several points in the meal, which was probably a result of it not being super-crowded.  Needless to say, this new branch of Burgatory beats many of the mediocre North Shore eateries, so if you're in the neighborhood and are hungry, check it out!",

Anything you want. With that said, we ordered off the menu.   Seeing how it was my birthday I ordered a cocktail, Strawberry Basil Shag, delicious and refreshing with chunks of strawberries and big basil leafs. I wish I could have a pitcher of that. Fork It for the appetizer, fries were a nod to traditional poutine. Loaded with shredded pork, gravy, and a few cheese curds, I would have loved more cheese. My burger of choice was the Piggy Butter and Jelly, spicy and sweet and juicy. On paper it's an odd combination, in my mouth perfection. I chose to substitute the chips for the slaw which was a great idea. The slaw was cool and creamy and perfectly cut and seasoned. It balanced the spicy burger awesomely. My date had the Trippin Chicken, which he devoured, with a side of quinoa salad. The quinoa was light and fresh compared to all the other items.   I could go back here again and again and never be bored with the menu. Service was good, atmosphere cool, good tunes playing and sports on the tv. What more could you ask for?",

That's doesn't mean I will pass up a fast food burger if need be, nor will I scoff at a mid-range burger like a 5 Guys; but if you claim your product is on point and it's not, I'm calling your bluff.  This place makes no claims, and it doesn't need to...BURGATORY. IS. LE-GIT!  No joke, one of the top 5 burgers I've ever had. WHY do you ask? Maybe it's because I got to design it just the way I like it with a handy-dandy checklist that I penciled in and submitted to our waiter. Maybe it's the combo of fresh guacamole topping my burger on a soft, buttery pretzel bun. Maybe it was the thick cut potato chips that came with my burger, I JUST DON'T KNOW! It was so good I could overlook the fact that it wasn't coked mid-rare (which may have been my fault. The menu gives you 3 options for temp: red, pink, or cooked. I went with pink hoping it meant mid-rare, and it came out more mid to mid-well...WHATEVER, still delicious!).  Did I mention the milkshake? NO!? Milkshakes ALSO sick-good. Salted Carmel pretzel milkshake to be exact, and it was, like my burger, worthy of a G.O.A.T.-like ranking. No joke, I almost ordered a second.  Add good service, funky-fun decor, a loaded menu, and perfect location in between Heinz Field, PNC Park, and the North Shore subway station, it's a recipe for a winner. Sadly it's can only be found in the 412, so if you're driving through the Burgh, staying for a few days, or checking out a game, come here and message me and tell me how right I was.",

I actually already wrote a review for Burgatory Homestead location..but this place is so good I figured I'd write another review for a different location. I have eaten at all the locations and they are all equally as good. There's no difference between the locations, so no matter which location you eat at you'll get the same great food and service.  I've only had the veggie burger so I can't speak for the other burgers but their veggie burger is the best I've had anywhere. My favorite toppings are pineapple with fried onions or sometimes an egg. Their burgers are huge and extremely filling. Usually only able to eat half at a time.  You can not leave Burgatory without ordering a milkshake. I always order them to go because once again their milkshake are huge too. They have some of the best milkshakes I've had anywhere.  Burgatory is totally addictive...once you eat here you'll be hooked and you'll just crave their food!!",

Crisp on the outside without being cooked hard or dried out. Juicy plump meat on the inside. Not to mention that the sauce was sweet and slightly spicy...finger licking good. The fries with short rib, cheese curds, gravy...omg it does not matter if you have to do the tread mill for an hour and walk 5 miles! The fries are hand cut. Cheese curds are the perfect size to melt slightly but still have a bit of chewy stringy cheese that you basically twirl your fork around. The short rib meat was tender like butter! Reminiscent of a crock pot slow cooked roast! Our burgers came out perfectly cooked to order! It is tough sometimes to get a burger on point like that! The roll was a perfect match. It held up to that juicy succulent burger! They also offer a small decent craft beer menu, cocktails (made with beer), milk shakes (with or without booze),etc. The service was friendly, helpful, with the right rhythm. Check out their T Shirt offerings too. A portion of the sales goes to a local charity. There are a couple styles and a couple different sayings...all in black. I think that they ought to offer red too...just a suggestion. Anyway both of us were completely satisfied with our experience here and we will return if we travel through the area again.",

Upon arriving the hostess stared at us for probably 15 seconds and never spoke, I finally said hello and she continued to stare. My husband intervened (I'm typically much more hot headed than he is) he asked her if there was a problem and it's customary to be greeted by the HOSTESS!  She argued telling him that every once in awhile the customer should greet her. Needless to say she continued with her rude behavior and finally had someone else seat us. The restaurant was very warm and we were seated in an area which is I suppose used for indoor/outdoor. Our waitress was friendly but could have explained things better being this was our first time there and she was aware of this. The food like I said was good and had we been treated a little better upon arrival we would have returned on the next trip but I think we'll just leave it as one and done. To the management this event occurred on Wednesday July 19th, 2017 so you may want to get the hostess lined out before she ruins others experience as well.",

I've been past multiple Burgatorys over the years, and never had a chance to stop We had a chance after the Pens game on Saturday, and I must say that the food did not disappoint. The ambiance is very modern and it has a very inviting atmosphere.The \"create your own\" burger is a fantastic concept from start to finish. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the seasonings/toppings were fantastic. The chips that come with it were phenomenal as well. I did not have a milkshake, although everyone raves about them. My only problem with this place is that the wait is astronomically long no matter what time you go in. This is why I've never went in the past. This obviously illustrates how great of a restaurant that Burgatory is, however, the service is ridiculously slow for a place that only sells burgers (service not being waiters, as everyone there was very friendly and welcoming, not their fault). I would definitely suggest this place, you just have to be prepared to wait.",

They seemed busy both inside and outside, but to my surprise we were well attended to--our two burgers and two rounds of beers came quickly. I've had the phat patty and the crab cake one before but this time I went all out and got the burger with peanut butter, bacon, habanero jelly, pickles (piggy something...very apt name based on its size alone). It was delicious. They had East End on tap, so I like that I can support a local brew. Was a great pre-concert meal, and would be good (but probably even busier) before or after a baseball or football game. I find the area to be kinda weak in food offerings, so to me it was a welcome new option. Third visit to a Burgatory and still haven't tried a milkshake though. So I'll definitely be going back.",

I went with the Fiddy-Fiddy burger (1/2 beef, 1/2 bacon), on a local grain bun, with a cracked peppercorn rub, smoked gouda cheese, Sriracha remoulade, lettuce, mayo and jalapenos.  If that wasn't enough I got the organic greens as a side.  The burger was wonderful.  The meat was absolutely delicious and juicy.  The rub gave it a great flavor and all of the other toppings meshed well.  The greens were also good.  I was being good, after the debachery of the night before.  Honestly though, great place.  Very clean, attentive staff, delicious food.  I do hope this chain makes a move farther than Pittsburgh, because we could use one in NY.",

My daughters friend got wings, we got burgers. Everything tasted great! Service was great! However... each time I take kids out to eat I clean up their spots at the table. I took the paper out of the wing tin and it was RUSTED! Like not a little rusty... full out rust all around the inside. We had already paid our bill. All our waitress said was, \"sorry, have a nice day.\" Like do they not have to clean these things? Out of curiosity I looked in the tin that holds the silverware and it was gross on the bottom. Thank goodness only my napkin touched that or I would have been even more livid. My daughters friend ended up sick this particular night. I am not sure if it was from this tin or not, but odd coincidence to me!",

I would eat that over any meat based burger any day! However, not all blue skies! THE PARKING SITUATION IS TERRIBLE! But thats all. Give that impossible burger a go!",

I ordered the cookie monster shake, maybe I should have read the description in more detail, but it was extremely underwhelming. It's regular chocolate chip cookies blended into a shake. The ice cream they used was not very good either. An unsatisfying shake.  Their truffle fries smelled good, was good, and was a pretty big portion. Definitely can share the fries. Lastly, I ordered a peanut butter burger. If you've never had a peanut butter burger before, you need to try it. It may not sound very good, but once you take a bite, your taste buds will thank you. Overall, I was hoping for a more ravishing milk shake, but can't complain because the burger was on point.",

We show up to find that the exhaust system is down, so they can only do shakes and salads.. That's fine, it happens, and I'm sure the restaurant was upset that it was missing out on profits on what is probably one of the busier days of the year. We went to Bar Louie for dinner, but I decided that I still needed that Nutella Crunch milkshake. I ran over in pouring Pittsburgh rain, and to my surprise, the host informed me that they were closing. At 7pm. When they're not supposed to close until 10. It really put a damper on my day, visit to Pittsburgh...and my clothes.",

Unfortunately I've gotten the same burger twice (steakhouse burger) which was accidental but realized why I wasn't impressed the last time as both times the burger tasted like the gas I'm presuming it was cooked on. Not sure if they all taste like that or if it's the fried onions that come with it. The meat was cooked well and as I ordered it, the chips that come with it are good but second negative was I felt the beer was a little pricey (just missed happy hour). May try one last time to get another burger but if it tastes like gas I'm out.",

I have since tried several other places and Burgatory is still hands down my favorite place to get a burger - but be prepared to leave feeling very stuffed! You can choose one of their pre-made burgers or you can Create Your Own. They have every topping sauce, seasoning, type of meat, bun, anything you could ever think of. I also must recommend trying a milkshake, spiked or not they are both good. I never thought I would like spiked milkshakes, the idea of mixing dairy and alcohol just didn't sound appealing. Burgatory changed my mind again. The Espresso Love milkshake is the best milkshake I've ever had. This is always my first choice of restaurant when I feel like indulging.",

I was really intrigued by some of the burger options on the standard menu -- especially the peanut butter and habanero jelly -- but ultimately I couldn't resist the allure of the tiny green pencil and the create-your-own burger sketch pad. About the only bad thing about the burger I ended up concocting is that I'm fairly certain I'll never be able to recreate it in all its sriracha coated splendor. There were so many elements -- all working so well together -- I'm not sure I could ever remember them all. But no worries here. The options are seemingly endless for a reason. I look forward to returning to design something new.",

    "text": "[I'd give it a 2 1/2]  Whenever I visit Pittsburgh I make a point of visiting some location of Burgatory for the Bison Burger- haven't been disappointed yet! That being said I'm from DC and I'm not used to restaurants that: 1) don't take call ahead seating 2) have more than an hour long wait for just 2 people. At home, even very popular restaurants only have 50 min waits for groups of 6 or more (I speak from personal experience). And if it's the type of restaurant that would have that kind of wait for just 2 people, you can call ahead, even if it's a limited time in which you could do so- so you can use your wait time to travel and park for example.   It was not the normal dinner rush  time and the only game a Pittsburgh team was playing at the time was hockey which no-one seemed to be watching, as only 1 tv actually had that game on. [It's also just the beginning of the season so people seem much more occupied with football than hockey at the moment]. Went to one location and decided we could not wait an hour or more, it was an unsure estimate we were given. So we called another location where they told us they couldn't take a call in reservation but we could download an app and get on the list that way- the wait was about 35 min. So we did that. Arrived and checked in. Still had to wait another hour? So why did we download the app?   The service was good and the food was good! This is the third time and third location I've been to of Burgatory and I very much intend to go again because I really love the food (the virgin espresso love shake is out of this world)! I just really don't know how I'm supposed to brace myself for potentially waiting more than an hour to be seated...They really, really, REALLY need to take call ahead seating.",

Very good tasting patty , rather thick and cooked perfectly .  The jalapenos should be fresh , but were soggy and without flavor .  Fries are optional and additional 1.50 . They are good , not great . They were not hot , not cold , also small pieces like the bottom of the bag .  My draft beer was not very cold .",

    "text": "When I saw that they had the Fiddy-Fiddy Burger, a burger that is half bacon and half beef, I knew I had to come here. While the service leaves a little to be desired (and I give them some leeway, since it was a busy Saturday night with a game next door at PNC Park), the food is well worth it.  I would suggest getting a customized burger. I got a Fiddy-Fiddy with cheddar cheese on a pretzel bun. It was, honestly, one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was salty, smoky, juicy and just everything you would imagine a burger made partly out of bacon is. If I could have one every day I would gladly drop dead of a heart attack in five years. They're really that good. If you're really feeling gluttonous get one of their shakes. Their Burnt Almond Torte shake, flavored with amaretto, is tasty and addictive. There are little pieces of almond floating in it, giving it a nice crunch.   Anyway, I'm sad there isn't one of these near me, but when I make the journey out to Pittsburgh again I'm sure to stop back at another Burgatory location. The choices are endless and the food is good, burger lovers should rejoice.",

We got there within an hour of closing, which I hate doing...but these crazy highways can get you lost and if you miss a turn, you are f'd--anyway, we didn't feel rushed at all. My bro had some burger with an over easy egg, a shake with liquor and he's ready to go back. Location is bomb being right by the stadium, so we might make that happen pre-game. It's legit!",

Cons: My burger wasn't as phenomenal as my Pittsburgh native friends promised me it would be. And to be honest, it was so greasy and so big I couldn't put it in my mouth. I took the bun off and cut parts of the burger and ate it but I wasn't wowed.  Overall, I would definitely come here for the milkshakes again because really they were THAT delish!",

This is a 100% vegetarian burger made out of wheat and potatoes, that apparently makes it the closest thing to eating meat. What sets it apart from other veggie pattys is an ingredient called 'heme', sourced from soy root which is what gives it its meat-like texture/flavor. This is the 'vegetarian burger that bleeds' and in Pittsburgh, is only available at Burgatory. While my boyfriend absolutely loves it and will go back again and again for the impossible burger, I prefer going back to Burgatory for their other vegetarian (less meat-like) burger options. All in all, we love Burgatory for different reasons (or burgers). Their cocktails are on point and shakes, epic! Servers are always friendly and efficient. I love the outdoor patio at their north shore location and it's become an after-work happy hour favorite for me!",

Service was good, though there was a relatively long wait between ordering and being served despite the crowd thinning out. The food arrived hot and was tasty enough, but 2 of the 3 orders were wrong. (Surprisingly, it was the 2 orders written down on their custom order form that were wrong.) One order was missing onion straws. My order was a fiddy-fiddy (50% beef - 50% bacon blend) that was to be red in the middle. Now, maybe they can't serve a fiddy-fiddy rare because of the bacon as it came out brown all the way through. And, if it was 50% bacon in the blend, I would be really surprised as there was no bacon taste to it at all and it was somewhat dry - not what I would have expected with that much bacon in it.   If they couldn't serve it the way I asked, they should have told me before cooking it. If that wasn't the reason, then I really am disappointed that they couldn't cook it to the temp requested leading me to believe that it wasn't even the correct burger patty put on my sandwich.  The reason I am giving three stars is, despite the mix-ups, the taste was still good, but not as good as I had hoped!     P.S. The day before, I got a perfectly rare burger at the Industry Public House.",

Was pleasantly surprised at how nice and big it was, considering that they were able to seat the party of 15 that I came with all at one table. Same pros of the Burgatory chain in general apply to this location too. One of their huge strengths is their milkshakes ... so many different kinds and they all taste yummy! My favorite ones are probably the Campfire Smores or the Salted Nutella Crunch. Though this time I ended up trying the Eclair Don't Care spiked milkshake. Was a tad disappointed that I could not taste any of the alcohol that was present/not present? in the shake so I will probably err on not getting a spiked one next time. Burgers here have always been pretty good. Like that they give you the option to customize ... lots of different kinds of patties, toppings, cheeses, dressings, condiments, fixings, and sides galore so definitely take advantage of it! In general, the joint leans on the noisier side but that's not terribly surprising, seeing as they also have a sports bar inside the joint as well.",

Beer Selection is not terrible (on par with what I expect, and I tend to be snobbish at times). Appetizers, the nachos were good, but the \"When Pigs Fry\" fried ribs came out. They were phenomenal, this was unbelievable. Further all of our burgers were great. I had the \"Meat Your Maker\" served as \"red\" (they do red, pink, and no pink) I was extremely happy (in fact blown away again.) I had team mates from Philly, Jersey, NY, and Virginia and they all said it was one of the top 5 burgers they've ever had so way to put Pittsburgh on the map.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, seem subfriendly service. Unfortunately the condiments are not really noted that they are an aditional fee $1 each for tomatoes onions peppers etc. The menu gives you the impression any toppings that are not marked is possible they are free...Beware I ordered Bison $12 regular toppings that are usually free on a sandwich in DMV they charge for here.. Manager was not customer friendly and basically told me Anywhere else you would need to pay for condiments  .. Rule of thumb its best for waitresses or waiters to be courteous and tell if there is additional pricing for items, and not go back and forth if with a customer. But np, 1st visit last visit. Food was mediocre.",

There wasnt one dish at our table that wasnt fantastic. We went on a Wednesday night so the place wasn't packed. Location was very nice. Enjoyed the decor. Prices were on point. A must try!",

    "text": "In town for the steelers game over the weekend and was so excited to visit this spot. Unfortunately it was one of the worst experiences ever. Walked in Friday night and it was an hour until the kitchen closed. The bartender was rude and barely would let us pick what we wanted to drink let alone offer a drink menu until we asked. Then finally after rudely giving drinks and not even saying a \"your welcome\" after saying thank you for drinks she asked if we had ever been here before (we had only been at the bar for 20 minutes) She then proceeded to offer menus and we ordered a couple appetizers and they were cold and awful. Such a bummer this was such a horrible experience. We come to Pittsburgh once a year for a game and will not go back at least to this location. With all other bars and restaurants in the area this and coming to the Pittsburgh for years this was our only bad experience out of the whole city.",

    "text": "I have nothing bad to say about Burgatory.  I have been to the one in Robinson a few times and the burgers were good but nothing special.  I can honestly say the one I had last night in the North Shore was hands down the best I have ever had.  I went with the custom option and chose topless beef with the mushroom rub, smoked gouda, bacon jam, caramelized onions, fried egg, field greens and truffle shallot aioli.  I wanted to kick something.  It was that good.  Someone needs to high five that chef.",

    "text": "I'm always on the lookout for the perfect Burger, and Burgatory pretty much nails it. The burger patties are always thick, juicy, and cooked to medium rare perfection. I tried the Prime Rib Dinner burger, and no kidding, it tasted like a prime rib dinner on a burger, complete with horseradish and fried onions. It's one of those gimmicky concoctions that shouldn't work, but it really does. Also on par with their burger concoctions are their milkshakes. The place gets really crowded on weekends, but somehow the service is still pretty good.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! We are here while visiting Pittsburgh for a Pirates game. It is very close to the stadium. There is the now mainstream idea available to construct your own burger, which proved delicious. Try the pretzel bun if you get one. The chile is great as well, and so is the standard deluxe burger if you don't want to construct your burger. Good friendly service, which was also prompt. We were most excited about the incredible shakes! Do not leave without one. We tried salted caramel, nutter butter and Cookie Monster. All were delicious and distinctive. Why has no one thought of this before?",

Our waitress Jennifer was extremely friendly. She explained the menus for us since we never ate there before. We had milkshakes with alcohol. They were very good and they were very filling. We ordered onion rings that were huge and delicious. The sauces that came with them were a little spicy. We also custom ordered burgers. We picked everything from the buns the meat and the toppings. They were some of the best burgers we ever ate. The staff were all very friendly and they kept the restaurant very clean. Highly recommend Burgatory.",
