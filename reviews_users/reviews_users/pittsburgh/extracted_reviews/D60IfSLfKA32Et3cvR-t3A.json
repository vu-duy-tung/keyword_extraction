    "text": "One star only because you can't have zero. I asked my waitress what their quiche of the day was and she rattled off a few, I asked for the 4 cheese and she basically insisted I try the Philly cheese steak....I think they had to get rid of it or something. since she was so insistent, I ordered it and a side of bacon, Which I requested extra crispy. The quiche was dry, very chewy, had no seasoning and the crust was soggy...I think they left it in the microwave too long. The fruit that came with it had 4 tiny strawberry slices, 3 slices of banana a few small pieces of melon and 4 grapes...the potatoes were not worth eating and the bacon...well, I guess that they couldn't microwave long enough.  My waitress, after insisting I order garbage, was no where to be found...she never came back to the table until I asked another server to please get my check....then she finally came back and brought a box for my mostly uneaten breakfast. She never once asked if there was something wrong with the food. I gave her the money for the check and she disappeared again for almost 10 minutes..she came back and advised me she took so long because she was chatting with another table of people she knew....great. I boxed the food up, told her it was awful but she was welcome to take the leftovers since she suggested that it was so delicious. Again, no apology or anything. I like the Bobs in Carnegie and on Grove Road....but Painters Run....just BAD! This was my 2nd visit there and both were a waste of money. Too many other great breakfast places around to waste money on a location with bad food and horrible service.",

How did this place even get zoning approval with parking for 12 cars and the spaces were designed for Mini-Coopers.  What a mess.  For those of you familiar with the old Skidgys in Mt Lebanon which deservedly went out of business years ago, this is nothing more than a reincarnation only worse.  Eat'n Park would be a 4 star restaurant compared to this place, and I despise Eat'n Park, yuk!   Portions are horrid, quality and service is below average, metal shavings and green pepper in the coleslaw, food is oily and greasy, 3 green beans a side dish does not make and the beans were raw-hardly cooked, even the rotating dessert case was completely unappetizing, basically I have nothing positive to offer or comment about this place.

Now for the stuff that matters, the food. I had the breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg, and cheese and my wife had the banana french toast. Both were awesome! The sandwich was on perfectly toasted Italian bread piled high with eggs, fresh sausage and melty cheese. I got a side of home fries with it and honestly didn't even need to. They were delicious too, but the sandwich was so filling. My wife's french toast was unreal. It was perfectly drizzled with the right amount of syrup and loaded with bananas. I honestly expected it to be way too sweet, but it wasn't by any means. It was just the right amount of sweetness and not overpowering. Also, everyone who works here is super nice and welcoming. This is a really great breakfast spot, and we can't wait to go back for more breakfast and even lunch.",

I opted for My Dad's Favorite, which included a bit everything. Everything was yummy and my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. But the home fries and pancake were incredible. The crust on the potatoes were perfection and very rarely can places achieve that perfect combination of crunchy outside but tender inside. And the Cookies and Cream pancake, which spanned the size of an entire dinner plate, was fluffy and just the right amount of sweet to wrap up the meal.  I do want to make it a point to again reiterate how pleasant the staff was because I think it set this experience over the top. Our server, Sammi (I believe) was so genuinely nice throughout our meal despite how hectic I'm sure her morning was going.

    "text": "Yikes, Bob's is getting a really bum rap, his small circle of neo-canteens finally expanding into the South Hills. We'd been to the his outpost in Kennedy Township some time ago, and when we found out that one recently sprouted in Upper Saint Clair, well, we knew had a trip ahead of us.   For breakfast that chilly Saturday morning, I honestly enjoyed the Big Burrito, finding it generously appointed, the grilled flour tortilla bulging radiantly with eggs, homefries, onions, green peppers, and my choice of bacon, warm salsa, cheddar, and sour cream coming close to turning it into an enchilada, and damn  was this knife-and-fork material. The scrambled eggs were velvety, the homefries deftly seasoned and al dente, the vegetables lovingly caramelized, adding sweetness to contrast the tang of the sour cream and salsa and sharpness of the cheddar. Hearty as a 3 course meal, I barely had enough room left for the Oreo Pancakes.   And yes, I will continue to trumpet the cause: Breakfast pancakes are dessert. Lunches and dinners have sweet endings. Why not breakfast?   These were fairly standard griddlecakes with some Oreo crumbles on them, the commercially made cookies being but an afterthought, and that would be my only complaint.  I would have thought that the batter would have been infused with Oreo crumbs, but that was not the case here. Despite my mild disappointment, the flapjacks were properly fluffy and were topped with powdered sugar. Of course, warm maple syrup and butter were served alongside the golden stack.   We had no issues with the service or the seating. Even \"Bob\" himself was on hand to greet us and seat us, his personality proving to be as sunny as the decor.   From what I was tastin', Bob's fledgling empire of checkerboard-tiled luncheonettes is well on its way to competing with Pamela's and DeLuca's for diner supremacy.  Dismiss the savaging. Give Bob a chance.   P.S. The parking lot is a bit small, so be mindful of that.   P.P.S. We were told that the cakes and pies come from Castle Shannon's Signature Desserts.",

The carrots were really good and went well with the potatoes and gravy, like a version of a pot roast dinner (which they also offer).  The service was friendly, and the food came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.  My only is not getting here on a Tuesday night to try the turkey dinner special.  Otherwise, I would eat here again",

He gave it all a thumbs up. I took a taste of the potatoes and are not fresh but I'm a fan of the box stuff so I agreed they were good. The service was good but it's doubtful that we'll be back",

The inside is nice and new, but the food is much less to be desired. We will be going back to the Carnegie location from now on.",

Pot Roast was very good and fresh. lotsa potatoes and carrots. Prices were what I expected to pay. The staff was extreeeeemly friendly & fast. I give Bob's 5 stars.  You people are way too tough on many of these small places. Seriously , if the parking lot is a big issue with you , your not focused on the big picture ! Park down the street and walk your lazy ass to the front door !  We NEED to keep places like this going , or we will be stuck with Denny's on every street corner. Bob's is going to be one of my new places to eat.",

My husband got the Bountiful Breakfast and I chose My Dad's Favorite. The only complaint was that my husband's eggs were over easy and he ordered over medium well. So they were a little runnier than he usually likes. Other than that, great breakfast. Well worth it!",

We were then seated at a table in the very back directly across from the bathrooms...appetizing!  In all fairness she asked if that was ok but we were hungry and had our infant with us so we said ok- the point here is that there shouldn't be a table there to begin with!   Took 10 min to get greeted and 20 min for our food.  Although busy, the allure of a diner is the quick service and cheap prices- which were NOT cheap!  It was nearly $9 for an omelet with any cheese and 2 choices of veggies or meat.  Each additional option was 50 cents.  If you wanted a western it was nearly $10! I think this is a lot compare to other diners like Toms in dormont.    After waiting for what felt like forever, the food was really good.  The turkey sausage was really salty though and they only gave a tiny cup of syrup for the pancake, which was luke warm.    We might try this one more time but not for a while.  Let them work out the kinks!",

Coffee was fresh and never got below half way full. The breakfast sandwich had two strips of bacon. If it had one more piece of bacon the sandwich would be balanced. The french toast looked awesome. It was missing something though, like a touch of vanilla or cinnamon. The side of hash browns was a decent size side.  I would like to give this place another go and try something different.",

The salad was your basic diner salad. The jumbo shrimps were perfectly fried and the sweet potato fries were great. I wanted to try the soup which is homemade each day but since I couldn't decide, I just went for the salad. We'll definitely be back. I wish I would've taken a picture of my meal but I dove in too quickly and by the time I thought of it, there were 3 shrimp left. Just another excuse to go back.",

    "text": "My friends were getting together for breakfast to celebrate school being out. (They are teachers.) The friend who was putting the gathering together chose this restaurant.  I had been to another Bob's location when it first opened and it was horrible.  It's been awhile so I thought I would give this location a shot.  I was rather shocked when I got there because the parking lot was full.  That's a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a good thing because it means people like it there.  It's a bad thing because I ended up parking on the road.  Two others in our group parked at a business close by that was closed but then got yelled at by a customer of that business.  It would benefit the restaurant greatly if they could find a way to expand parking.  Thankfully though I was parked on the road my car didn't get hit.  We went in and seated ourselves as per the sign.  It took a long time before our server came to our table.  In fact we rarely saw our server.  It was busy when we first went in but cleared out soon after so I'm not sure where the server was.  When she was waiting on us she was very nice.   I ordered the breakfast that had eggs (I chose scrambled), breakfast meat (I chose bacon), home fries, and toast (I chose Italian).  It took quite awhile for our food to come.  I'm not sure why it took so long and we weren't given an excuse or an apology.  My eggs were soft scrambled.  I would have sent them back but had no idea how long it would be before I got food back.  The bacon was thick and cooked nicely-a little crispy and a little chewy.  The home fries were a bit overdone.  You received a big portion that covered half your plate.  They were ok but nothing to write home about.  The toast was toasted nicely but had a ton of butter on it.  I wiped about half of it off.  I ate about 1/3 of my meal and got a box for the rest.  I was still a little hungry (just turned off by the eggs) so I ate part of a fruit plate that my friend had ordered.  It was the biggest fruit plate I had seen and four of us ate from it.  The fruit was fresh which was nice.  So my experience had it's ups and downs.  I hope you get a good experience if you check this place out.",

As soon as you walk in you're  greeted with a warm hello and tonight was seat yourself please.  We ordered everything from fried chicken to burgers and the best for me, tonight's special which was prime rib. Not a bad price of 16.99 which included a potato and a vegetable. I chose mashed which were nice and fluffy and I devoured them.  We chose to pass on dessert tonight but we did start with a zucchini appetizer which was fresh and tasty.  You will never go home hungry, this joint is a diamond in the rough.",

They don't do anything fancy at Bob's Diner; they just consistently serve excellence on a plate. Their French Toast (made with Mancini's Bread) is probably the best I have ever had.   Keep up the good work, Bob's!",

    "text": "Bob's diner is located here in Upper St Clair is the 4th location for this diner. I decided to stop over here en route home and try it out. Since it was a little after noon there was plenty of parking even though their lot is small. I entered and was told just to seat myself. They serve breakfast all day but I was in the mood for lunch but nothing overwhelming.  I noticed the menu has a special where you can order half a sandwich (limited choices on this sandwich) and pair it with either a cup of soup or small salad for $6.95. I decided to opt for that one and ordered roast turkey with lettuce and tomato. Got the food in a jiffy. I was amazed at the size of my order! The salad was more than enough for me and the half sandwich was big and came with chips. They were both very good. The turkey tasted fresh!   I was looking in their dessert fridge and saw they had very little to offer. My waitress told me they don't get that much in at this time of year but they expect more tomorrow. All their desserts come from Signature desserts in Castle Shannon. I also learned that Jan-Mar is their slow season but they will pick up more business once winter is over.  They have daily specials on the chalkboard. I was pleased with my meal and definitely will return. She gave me a takeout menu. As I looked it over I can see why it gets so crowded in the morning. They offer M-F weekday breakfast special until 10 AM. This special consists of two eggs, choice of bacon, sausage or ham with toast for $5.95. Prices are very reasonable for breakfast regardless and I noticed the sell a lot of things made with Mancini's bread. They even have a kids menu which they encourage only for those 10 and younger.  They offer both hot and cold sandwiches, as well as burgers, and dinner entrees. I saw some people as I was leaving eating pancakes and other breakfast items so that's what I will try on my next visit. The menu is comprehensive so there is much to choose from. They do catering as well.",

It consisted of lots of greens (mostly iceberg lettuce) + onions + cherry tomatoes + cucumber slices + banana peppers + cheddar cheese + a large chicken breast that was beautifully fried. There were also French fries on the top--a P'burgh tradition!  My husband had a BLT.  We were both very pleased.  Our waitress also was very attentive & efficient.",
