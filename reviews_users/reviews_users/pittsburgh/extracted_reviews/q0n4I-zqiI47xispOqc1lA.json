    "text": "From the outside, you'd think this cafe would be tiny, but they utilize their space pretty well and have an outdoor seating area too. We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away indoors because there was no more space outside. The menu is plain and simple; they offer several omelettes, crepes, and French toast to choose from. We ordered the Spanikopita French toast (Baby Spinach, Feta, Asiago, Fresh Mozzarella, Balsamic Glaze), mocha French toast, and Swiss omelette. The Spanikopita French toast is the first savory French toast I've ever had and it was pretty good. The mocha French toast and Swiss omelette were unimpressive thoigh. The former was just bread soaked in chocolate with whipped cream on the side and the latter was just your typical omelette (a little dry though). Would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual brunch spot and I can imagine the brick-walled cafe being very cozy in the wintertime.

It is so european, cozy, such a lovely place, they have too many good options on the menu and its not that pricey at all. I had a mr green crepe its asiago mozarella feta with some fresh baby spinach in it. That was soo good.. comes with side salad and costs me only 9$. Server was so kind and quick. During my pittsburgh visit i believe this place will be on top of my restaurant list. They have a beautiful patio with umbrellas i love it.. you all gotta see this place",

The food is overpriced, I got a crepe with Nutella & bananas & it was literally just topped with it. The inside of the crepe was empty, we got a chai latte that was pretty much milk, way too much ice in my coffee that I was practically drinking water. Terrible communication.

After reading some less than stellar reviews I felt compelled to jump in and send Caffe Mona some love!  This place is incredibly cute - very European inspired, brick walls, wooden tables & an awesome back patio. Reminds me very much of Birchwood Kitchen in Chicago, which I love! Plus they have a killer location literally right across the street from Children's Hospital.   The $13.99 prix fixe brunch menu was an exciting thing to find. The only thing that could have made it better would have been knowing it was BYOB before we went. Nothing better with a tasty brunch than a good bottle of champagne, although their coffee was pretty darned delicious.  I started off brunch with a fresh fruit plate and everything served was in season, ripe & juicy. Great start. Then I was served a dish that made my eyes roll back in my head (even without the champs)! The savory French toast topped with house made fig jam, Brie that was super creamy & buttery and Granny Smith Apples was absolutely superb. The flavor combinations complemented each other perfectly and I only shared a couple of bites with hubby & devoured the rest.   I was totally stuffed when the final item, an apricot jam crepe, was placed in front of me. Sad to say, they should have skipped this item. It was crunchy & pretty flavorless. I couldn't have eaten it anyway, but based on the rest of the meal it just didn't compare.   Next visit, I'll have a hard time not ordering that French Toast again & you can bet there will be champagne!",

The waiter asked us if we were ready to order (we weren't) and sighed. We had just gotten seated and already we were feeling unwanted.  Once we ordered we waited for what seemed like ages, it was actually 40 minutes, and he never came over to tell us where our food was, if we wanted more water, to apologize for the wait, anything.  The people who came after us (smaller party) got their food before us.    My friends and I  were furious, we were going to just get up and leave and then he finally brought our food (no explanation either). We didn't even order anything particularly extravagant.  My friends both ordered savory crepes and I ordered the White Salad.  It was good, but way too much chicken.  My friends both said that the food was so creamy and rich that it made them sick.    TLDR: I would never go back, not even for big portions.",

Despite some of the negative reviews given to this place, I thought maybe I'll get luckier. However, my experience was a complete disaster.   The location is great, right on a main street. The cafe is spacious with plenty of lighting. However, they did not make very good use of the space. The decors were all over place with Christmas, spring and summer themes going on at the same time. The service was awful as well. The server was inattentive, rude when we asked for an extra minute to look over the menu and he mixed up our order when the food came out.  The food took exactly 40 minutes to arrive to our table. There were only two occupied tables in the entire cafe so there should be no excuse for taking that long. I ordered the Caffe Crepe with chicken, apples, avocado and melted brie. The chicken was overcooked and super bland with no seasoning at all. There were no avocados in my crepe. The only thing I could taste was the brie. The crepe was so horrible and tasteless that I could not finish it. Each bite was a complete struggle and I had to fight to keep my food down.   The food was bad. The service was bad. The experience was overall bad. I am ashamed for bringing my dining companions here. Caffe Mona, never again.",

It was a brisk morning, but it was still nice to have the cool breeze blowing through...until the cook went outside to smoke right in front of the window.  Inhaling cig smoke was a huge turnoff and really irritated us.  The tea selection is modest but I was beyond thrilled to find decaf English Breakfast.  For my meal I ordered the spanikopita crepe.  I was going to go for an omelet, but thought I should try something different that I can't get just anywhere.  The crepe was filled with spinach, onion, and feta cheese. It had an amazing flavor, but the crepe was rather rubbery. I actually felt like I was eating pizza rather than a crepe.    My friend got an omelet that she really enjoyed and she also got the Nutella dessert crepe. Again, her crepe was very tough and rubbery and there was only a small smear of Nutella on it.   I think if they tweak their recipe for crepe batter it could have far more potential to be an amazing food option. The omelet choices are pretty great. That's what I'll stick to, should I return.",

My friend had the chicken pesto salad which looked incredibly fresh and attractively constructed.  I had the Cheese steak crepe which I wanted to try just out of curiosity.  The flavor was exact but the crepe made the dish a whole new experience.  A good part of the menu is crepes and I wast to try many more.  The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive.

They have great patio and awesome Atmosphere. Staff are so kind and helpful. I ordered veggie omelette and iced latte. Best omelette I ever had for so long. Fresh ingredients and big portion. Coffee was so good too. Definitely coming back",

It was really tasty, and a wonderful combination of flavors.   Honestly, this may seem like a small grievance but I'm really put off by this: they automatically charge for bottles of water that you don't order. Sure, they're only .50, but I don't buy bottled water and made sure not to drink the teeny tiny bottle that was brought out (before I even arrived while my friend was waiting, no less). It didn't matter, it was on the bill anyway.   The server brought our check out, and I showed him my coupon for a free coffee upon check in on Yelp. We then gave our cards, but he didn't update the original bill or itemize it per person when he returned; just ran our cards. I think he split it 3 ways evenly instead of by item ordered because my bill was only a few cents cheaper than the others. So, I'm not certain that he took my coffee off my bill or not. Ordinarily, I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but given that they trick each customer into purchasing water that isn't ordered, I'm side-eyeing this place a lot harder than I would normally.",

    "text": "Another good spot for brunch in Pittsburgh!! My bf and I got different omelets, he got the \"southern\" which has mushroom and cheese and a salad. I got \"cherry\" with cherry tomatoes, bacon and swiss cheese, and a salad by the side, both are very good and just big enough to keep us full lol. The umbrellas weren't up when we went! Kind of disappointed. I like the inside of the cafe and their clean restroom. If I need to say something slightly not as perfect as anything else, it looks like they need a slightly better hood for the smoke to get out. Otherwise it is a lovely place to go to and people are all very nice. But please note they did charge for the little bottles of water so make sure you let them know that you do not need water if you don't want to have another $0.5.",

I ordered a sandwich and instead informing that they didn't have any provolone cheese they just assumed that I wanted asiago cheese and they put it in my sandwich. I never asked for that, I would have like them to tell me that they just didn't have anymore provolone. And, Instead of just making me a new sandwich they just scraped the asiago cheese off my sandwich and brought out the same exact sandwich. The asiago cheese was still on the meat, bread and onions. I was just flabbergasted. I couldn't just finish the sandwich. But the cappuccino was pretty good.",

But, my partner and I found our meals to be rather tasteless. He had pancakes. They tasted of nothing, not even vanilla. I had the French toast with Brie, fig sauce and granny smith apples. It came with a side of whipped cream. The apples were perfect tart, the Brie was bitter, the fig not sweet-enough and barely fig-flavored. Admittedly this was an odd combination of flavors which I thought could have worked if only....  Alas, we are unlikely to return.",

We can to the Caffe for brunch and ordered the Brentwood (bagel), Num Num (French toast), and savory crepe (forget name) with pesto, mozzarella, and tomato, which I added egg. Everything came out quickly and was delicious. It's a small, intimate cafe with art on the wall for sale, and if you blink you'll miss it on Penn Ave but definitely worth it!

When my husband told him what was happening, he made a delicious dessert for our son. It was perfect, a Nutella and banana crepe. My sandwich was incredible too. The grilled chicken and pesto sandwich. I'm so glad we went there and on our frequent follow up visits, we will go back any chance we get. Bravo to you and your employees!

Today the food again lacked flavor and wait staff were mediocre at best. When we first sat down they brought us bottled water we said no thank you and asked if we could have tap water instead we were told by the gentleman host that the filter was broken and that the \"nasty bacteria\" would make us really sick. When the waitress came over we again asked for tap she also said the filter doesn't keep out the bacteria and we should drink the bottled water. When we asked the waitress if they use bottled water for their coffee/tea, hand washing, rinsing of fruits & vegetables and cleaning of dining ware the waitress said they use the tap water. So either the host & waitresses have this lie teed up to make a quick buck on 8oz bottles of water or it's a health code violation. Regardless I called the health inspector and can't wait to see what new and exciting restaurant takes this dump's place.",

Our favorite menu options are the pierogie crepe (it sounds scary but it is scrumptious!), the brie and apple crepe, and the berries and cream french toast. You can't go wrong with anything, but the crepes and french toast are extraordinary. Don't waste your time with bagels or eggs--why not enjoy what Caffe Mona does best? Our only complaint is that they stop serving soup once it starts warming up, but we wish they served it all year because the tomato basil bisque is delicious!",

So I live a few blocks down from Penn and I've walked past this place dozens of times. I was really surprised to read that this place has been reviewed a bunch and seems so established. To be honest, almost every time I walk by the place is empty. And after walking in, even though it's very cool and beautiful on the inside, I got the sense that it was a newer place just starting to get its bearings. This was the case with my stop-in (around 10am on a weekday). The guy behind the counter was helpful and nice. Something that I noticed was a little odd was that he said the cook was out and I'd have to wait if I wanted to get food- so I got a cup of coffee and sat down to work for a bit. The coffee was good, and the Wifi is free and worked perfectly. After a while, the guy behind the counter gave me a menu and even a free refill on coffee while we waited for the cook the arrive. The menu actually looked really tasty, particularly the brunch food (I'm a sucker for breakfast food anytime of the day). I wasn't necessarily stopping in for food, but if I had I would have been frustrated waiting. I finally got up and paid for the coffee and left. I might come back to try the food- and hopefully the cook will be around!",

    "text": "As I drove by Caffe Mona looking for a parking spot, (good luck. parking is on the street only) I seriously considered turning around and canceling my brunch plans. Wow. This place is a little frightening from the outside. However, when I was able to find a spot at a nearby meter, I cautious walked in and took a huge sigh of relief. The inside is quaint but charming. A few tables inside and looks like a deck with tables outside in nice weather. Although I was drawn to Caffe Mona because of the prix fixed menu, I decided that I really wanted to try the Elvis (crepes with peanut butter, bananas & bacon) and I thought that a third course of a sweet crepes might be a little much. In addition to my Elvis, I ordered a fruit plate for an app. I was rather disappointed in the fruit plate. I understand that most fruits are not in season in late March but I was expecting a little more than just apples, bananas and white grapes. It was not pleasing to the eye. Also to note, my plate was significantly larger than my two dinning companions who ordered the fruit plate as their first course with the prix fixed menu. A few minutes later, I was presented with the glory that was the Elvis. I can still taste the sweetness of the syrup and bananas perfectly complimented by the saltiness of the crisp bacon. I sat back and enjoyed every last bite while the girls were presented with their third course, a crepe with strawbery jam. In conclusion, don't judge a book by its cover. Although Caffe Mona looks rough and tumble from the outside, the food, atmosphere and decor are well worth the fight to find parking.",

    "text": "At last, Kay and I made a lunch date with our saint of a Community Manager Rachel and a non-Yelping friend of hers. Rachel suggested Caffe Mona for a brunchy kinda get-together, and due to the establishment's hours, it made for a perfect Sunday afternoon fit.   As I write this, my dilemma is whether or not to give Caffe Mona a 3 or a 4.  First off, the service, while friendly, was somewhat flighty. Our server brought us a dish that none of us had ordered, and at the end of our meal, mixed up our split checks.   Secondly, the food seemed to be just a scintilla astray.   Acting as a starter was a tastefully simple plate of freshly cut fruit. Granny Smith Apples, pears, and watermelon triangles did wonders for my produce cravings of late. The watermelon in particular was gushingly ice-cold and made for ideal, wholesome snack.   My minor issues with the food began with my breakfast entree. The Potato Scramble, a dineresque \"garbage-style\" jumble of cubed tubers, Applewood bacon strips, Roma tomatoes, and Swiss cheese filled my stomach but failed to excite me much. An online search indicates a bit of controversy over whether or not to season scrambled eggs, but in this case, I felt a pinch of salt and a crank of the pepper mill would have lifted this dish from mildly palatable to positively epicurean. The textural admix of light/fluffy/crispy/chunky/creamy/gooey was bold while the flavors were a little shy.   Desiring a dessert of some kind, I also had an Oreo Crepe, which was supposed to contain within an \"Oreo-infused\" blanket both Oreo fragments and marshmallow. The crepe itself somewhat resembled a gourmet Pop-Tart in appearance, toasty taste, and mouthfeel and didn't seem to have any Oreo origins to speak of. The filling did have an Oreo gravel inside it but seemingly lacked the marshmallow, making the crepe far more timid than the decadent mess of a treat I expected. I did enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would.   So, perhaps a 3 is appropriate after all. Mona's got the looks with her modern, brick-and-wood-laden decor and welcome-to-my-new-loft ambience but could use some fine-tuning in terms of service and culinary technique.   P.S. All of us had a pleasant, chatty time together despite the uneven dining experience.",

It may very well be our new favorite brunch spot. Or one of them. It's SPECTACULAR!  My we shared so much stuff around the table it was unreal. The crepes were so yummy. I had the Elvis minus the bacon, bananas and peanut butter drizzled with maple syrup. So yummy, so good. Then my main course was the potato scramble. It wasn't a scramble in any way shape or form, it was an omelet. But it was one hell of an omelet. Cheese, tomatoes, and hash browns inside the omelet. So fluffy and so awesome. My good friend ordered the espresso french toast and said it was the best french toast she ever had. Drenched in a chocolatey gooey goodness. And had the perfect amount of coffee flavor to it. And the bread inspite of the glaze was still perfectly browned in butter.   My wife went with a savory french toast, one with pepperoni, tomato, olives. Not my scene, but she loved it so that's all that matters. She said she thought it was great.   My ONLY complaint was home fries. They weren't that great, oven browned I think then wayyy too much paprika. Most places trash home fries so no big deal. But the amount of paprika was WOW!! But no big deal.   Oh and I went and had the gingebread latte. Couldn't wait til' September, so I went ahead and had one. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Exceptional latte. Great.   Please go. If you love brunch, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "In sum, I do not recommend eating here. In fact, I feel I am being overly generous giving it 2 stars. I felt, since my picky brother enjoyed his strange meal that I should at least give it 2 stars. If we are to base it solely on my dish and that of my friends- a one star would more than suffice. That being said, I have to wonder if I should have eaten something other than crepes. I see my fellow trusted yelpers enjoyed their meals- but none of them eat the crepes!  Even if I never had a crepe before, let alone the AMAZING light as a cloud crepes from Paris 66 I would still know the crepes served here are largely inedible. But I am getting ahead of myself.  The place was largely empty when we arrived on a late weekend morning. Only about 3 other tables besides our party of 4. Yet we waited for over an hour for 2 orders of crepes, french toast, and a sandwich. Really?   Our waitress was not much for conversation. My friend, who is notoriously more picky than my brother requested whipped cream instead of something else in her crepe. At first, the waitress tried to convince her not to change the menu as it would annoy the cooks. After a few minutes of talking she finally accepted my friends request. She wanted to add whipped cream not lobster I don't see what the fuss was about to begin with- bygones.  I ordered a fruit crepe. Which the exception of the cooking outcome resembling a burnt-ish flaming campfire marshmallow, folded up like an egg roll, the taste was boring, burnt, and listless. I eat two bites and put down my napkin. I had no idea one could defile a crepe in such a way until that day.   My friend that requested the whipped cream. If I thought my crepe saw a rough afternoon her looked like it was literally dropped on the floor a few times then thrown on the plate. Guess they showed her for ordering that whipped cream? I can see now why the waitress warned us not to change the menu. May I suggest that their employees partake in some local anger management meetings?  My brother ordered the savory french toast. Italian made with ham, capicola, salami, pepperoni, and marinara Sauce. He loved it. Then again he also loves McD's and Taco Bell. I did not try his meal, I took his word for it.  My husband ordered a sandwich The Club- he said it was good. Not bad, not great but good.   Lastly, I was not a fan of their coffee either. I could not wait to leave. I only live a few blocks away and needed to go home to make something to eat.  On a positive note, I loved the Einstein artwork. It was the one positive thing I can recall of our visit.",

I enjoyed the Cherry Omelette (cherry tomatoes, swiss cheese, potato slices, and bacon) which was pretty big and cooked perfectly! Nice side salad and bread as well. Coffee was great and our server was warm and polite. Would recommend!",

I asked if they made cold drinks and they said they did. What was offered to me was disappointing. My cold drink was delivered in a double layered paper cup and there was too much ice in my drink so it became diluted too quickly. I will not be going back for the coffee.",

I noticed the lights outside and it caught our attention!  The food was incredible. She had the bagel and egg sandwich (you will see how it is done when you go) and said it was absolutely delicious. I had the banana split french toast--the name should say it all! They also offer other sandwiches and breakfast items as well as a full coffee/espresso bar.  Right on Penn across from the hospital, this is a place you definitely want to check out!",

It has an amazing hospital and neighborhood clientele that knows what to expect when to expect it and always happy to get it.  There is never a wait with call in ahead menu selections or a simple reservation for three or more. This is a secret for those of us who enjoy fresh food within a reasobable time frame or during the week you can also sit at the bar side with your computer and enjoy a few cups of coffee.....its quite convenient with comp wifi!",

We had also walked just as the restaurant was supposed to closed but we didn't realize, and yet the owner served us graciously.  The menu has some of the same offerings as J'eet did, with many new additions as well. Notably, the espresso machine and coffees have returned. Mike had the Elvis crepe (banana, peanut butter, and BACON!), I had one with spiced applesauce, caramel, and walnuts. The crepes themselves were excellent, just the right texture and the flavor spot on. I love the new crepe offerings, can't wait to try them, plus there is a French toast menu which is a great idea.  We chatted with the new owner for a bit, he's a really interesting and friendly guy and he makes good food for sure, so we'll definitely return!",

I was holding my coffee and when I went to let it go, it stuck to my hand because of how dirty the cup was. They also make you pay for tiny water bottles... I like to drink a lot of water, and had I known that is have to pay for it, i would have brought my own. The waiter offered me a new coffee but I declined because I just wanted to leave. He went to grab the check and came back with dessert, which was thoughtful and delicious... but that was the only part of my breakfast that I even enjoyed. I doubt I'll come back here.

The bread could have been toasted more other than that it was great. The Nutella love crepes was amazing and so huge! Now the iced chai latte heard great reviews but it was literally iced milk with cinnamon powder a lot of cinnamon powder on top. Our waitress was pretty bad at her job, a person in our party was asking if it'd be extra to add some veggies to her omelette, she's like yeah like a couple bucks but the kitchen decided not to charge her but she couldn't even tell her how much? She gave us water bottle and she told us oh we usually charge but today they're free? We didn't ask for bottle waters at all but if you offer that and going to try to charge us why not bring out glass of tap water unless some one asks for bottle water? Parking was tough but I'd definitely come back for the crepes for sure.",

We quickly perused the menu and decided on cappuccinos to start with. The cappuccinos are very sizable and pretty good quality. I mentioned to our server that we were thinking about Turkish coffee, but he told me that was typically reserved for after the meal.   I decided on the veggie omelet and my boyfriend got the Mona sandwich. Both were fabulous, but the Mona sandwich was definitely the winner... try it! We also split a Nutella and banana crepe, which should not be missed.   After we finished up, the waiter remembered we were interested in Turkish coffee, and asked if we would still like some but unfortunately we were way too full. Will definitely be back to try it out though!  The only reason I am rating Caffe Mona a 4 is because of the bathroom cleanliness. Wish it was a bit more well maintained.",

Because it is situated right next to Children's Hospital, it's in a perfect spot for those visiting the hospital as well as those just looking for a great new brunch spot to try. When I came, I first ordered a caramel latte. I'm not exactly the biggest coffee enthusiast, but I know high quality when I taste it. And this latte was excellent! My sister had a plain coffee and commented on the quality as well. I ordered the Chevre omelet, and loved it. However, my sister ordered the buffalo chicken crepe, and I was a little jealous I hadn't ordered a crepe myself! Her meal was fantastic. I would definitely recommend trying a crepe if you come and are into that. If you aren't, there are a lot of other great options on the menu as well.",

    "text": "It looked so promising. I saw the cute outdoor counter/walk up window the day before and thought I'd give it a shot. Walking in, staff seemed a bit frazzled and there was small confusion about seating. They were apologetic and I was seated.  I ordered a coffee as I looked over the menu. Another waitress came by and asked what I wanted. Mocha French toast, please. I sat and waited and watched more frazzled encounters with other patrons. I checked in on Yelp (free coffee) and was playing with my phone. A waiter comes by and asks about my check in redemption on Yelp after I've toggled away. It was a bit creepy watching what patrons are doing on their phones.  After that strange encounter and over 30 minutes later did the two slices of French toast arrived. It's covered in chocolate syrup and that was all I could taste. I move some of it off while cutting the toast. Not exactly what I was expecting, but at this point, I've waited long enough and needed to get on with the day. The first slice is fine, but then here's where it went bad. Into the second toast, I tasted the egg batter and spit it out. Thinking it might have been a bad edge, I cut another piece and more egg batter and I immediately spit it out. I'm done and worried. A waitress sees my expression. I informed her it wasn't cooked completely and another waiter comes to examine the toast. Odd, but they take it away. I'm done.  Yet another waitress comes by to check on me. I'm done, I say (Really? Why would I want more?). She comes with the check. Here's the kicker, they charged me the full amount even coffee! It wasn't edible! Raw egg batter!!  Ugh. Tired of the experience, I pointed out the coffee check in and was told it'll be taken care of. I was still charged for the French toast. That's when the waiter comes with fruit and gummy bears to apologize for the toast. No, grapes, slice of apple, kiwi, nectarine, and a couple of gummies doesn't make up for it. I'm already worried, a hodgepodge of stuff isn't what I want now.  Staff tried, but missed the mark. The French toast was covered in chocolate syrup for anyone to notice it was still batter. Avoid it. I ended up getting sick. Also, they charge 50 cents for water, without telling people. It's a mini 8 ounce bottle. So much hope for this neighborhood spot and it failed in many ways.",

They did not skimp on the brie so it was nice nice and melted. The crepe was topped with apples, walnuts, syrup, and powdered sugar. The french toast was also beautifully presented with berries and chocolate sauce. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food.

I ordered a side of bacon with a crepe, and my bacon was literally so black that it was inedible. After asking to have it removed from our check, and advising that I didn't want to have it re-made, we finished our meals. Upon receiving the check, I handed over my debit card only to find that it was rung up for a completely different total. When I asked why I was then told that they forgot to charge us for the water on the original check. I understand if they charge for water, but that should have been disclosed at some point prior to ringing my card for a completely different total than what I was advised when I handed over my card. On top of all of that, the food was mediocre at best. I will never spend money here ever again. All of that being said, I did tip the server 20% as I believe that service workers should be paid fairly, even when poor service is provided such as in this case.",

We ordered omlets, crepes, and some breakfast sandwiches. Ingredients are so fresh and tasty. I got apple bri crepe, melted bri cheese diced apple and walnuts with honey.

The brunch special is a great deal - you get to try multiple items for much less than their combined price. The menu is really extensive, with a ton of different types of crepes, sandwiches, French toast, omelettes and more. The food was pretty good; I appreciated the fresh, seasonal fruit on the fruit platter that came with the brunch menu (as an option), and my apple and Brie-filled omelette was tasty. Coffee was also good. Someone had their small dog on a leash; they seem dog-friendly. Nothing blew me away, but it was all good enough for the price!",

The French toast came with a shot on the side you could pour on the toast which was delicious, the crepe was huge and was full of flavor, and the cappuccino was delicious in the mason jar! Our server was great as well! Our favorite part was the patio. They have rainbow umbrellas hung up all over the place with other cute decor all around! They also gave all the tables a free plate of cream puffs which were to die for! I was so happy I saw this place advertised on yelp, otherwise I don't know if I would have ever found it!!

I had a really good omelet with Gouda, portobello mushroom and spinach, my husband also thoroughly enjoyed his Nutella with bananas on French toast and my daughter had Berries and cream on thick French toast. Yes, she took pictures of our food. Yes, the service was excellent. Yes, there was nothing I could improve upon.

    "text": "Warning: Be sure to demand an ironclad written contract for any catering provided by this establishment, a mistake we made in not securing at the beginning.  The dishonesty of the proprietor has soured our taste for visiting Caffe Mona again.  Several months ago we enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch at Caffe Mona in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh.  We had excellent crepes and coffees, and on the way out inquired about the availability of the establishment for a bridal shower in June.  One of the owners showed us an inviting outdoor deck area and suggested that we could use the outdoor space, order off the menu and bring in our own alcoholic beverages for no extra charge.  Given that the most expensive crepe on the menu was $13, we assumed a $20 budget per person was adequate, especially because we were providing the tablecloths, alcohol, and dessert.  We reviewed the menu, set a date and time with the proprietor and headed home to Connecticut.  We felt we had discovered a wonderful place for the special event.  Then everything changed.  Two weeks before the event we confirmed our arrangement and agreed to visit the venue two days beforehand to make final arrangements and to provide a requested deposit.  Upon entering the establishment, I was informed by the other owner Eto that instead of ordering and paying off the menu, I would be required to pay a set fee of $40 per person in cash, even though the restaurant accepted credit cards for breakfast and lunch all the time.  Insisting that such a fee was never the agreement, Eto argued with me, stating that the fee included a room charge and a corking fee per person.  In the end he agreed to $30 per person, even though even that arrangement was excessive.  I requested a receipt and written invoice for the full charge; the owner scratched out an unprofessional handwritten \"$140 deposit taken, owe $250, Eto M\" on a piece of  scrap paper.  Given that it was only 48 hours before the shower, however, I felt I had no choice but to swallow the demand.  After the event that included crepes off the menu that ran from $8 to $13, a plate of cut fruit, and non-alcoholic beverages for 13 people, I prepared to pay the remainder of the $390 charge.  Eto again demanded cash payment only and then stated that he expected a $90 tip for the two owners and the waitress.  I refused to pay the tip for an already over-charged event, and he nastily told me to eat at McDonald's next time.   We won't return to Caffe Mona for even a cup of coffee.",

Every other place I called, seemed rude and annoyed, but the person on the phone at Caffe Mona was so nice and accommodating and allowed us to make a last minute reservation. The service was absolutely impeccable. We sat down and were served drinks right away. When we noticed the beautiful outdoor space with a roof made of colorful umbrellas, we asked if there was any way we could move outside. Again, they accommodated us and were so nice. The menu has such a good combination of savory and sweet items like crepes, french toast, and omelettes and everything was extremely reasonably priced. I had the mocha french toast and it was to die for. They also have a great selection of teas, coffees and lattes. I cannot speak highly enough about the atmosphere, service, and food at this restaurant.",

Not satisfied, not coming back. Left a lot to be desired.",

But I would give it four out of five.  The bacon chicken sandwich was very good with the exception of the chicken being kind of dry. I would give the sandwiches three out of five and probably choose something different next time I go.  Besides all of that came with the sandwich in the crate we're good they had balsamic vinegar rat on them.  The price was a little expensive for what we got. I was also little disappointed to find out that they did not have tapwater and we got charged for half size bottles of water.  Overall the experience was pretty good the staff was friendly and attentive environment was nice. We will definitely be back.",

None of the food was heavy or greasy, it was all fresh and light which I absolutely loved. And you cannot beat the prices. Our waitress was quick with the orders even though the place was busy. The owners/managers came to check in on us multiple times and gave us free desserts and fruits which was such a nice gesture. I loved this place and we will definitely be back for more brunches!!

The waitress gave us plastic bottled water when we sat down then asked us if we wanted drinks (we ordered iced tea and iced coffee). The drinks smelled and tasted off, indicating there is something wrong with the water. When we asked about it at the end of our meal after we got the check the waitress sort of played dumb about the water and then said she'd get the manager. We didn't stick around to talk to the manager because we were already put off by the whole experience. I didn't realize until scrolling through their yelp reviews that they charge 50 cents for the water bottles (no mention of that in the conversation with either waitress who helped us). Just really weird and kind of shady. The food was really disappointing as well. Avocado toast in my mind doesn't mean prepackaged guacamole and a cold fried egg. The bread used for both the avo toast and the French toast was terrible. Wouldn't go back after our first experience there.",

The sun was blazing on us through the cracks of the umbrellas and my legs got a bit sweaty on the chairs, anyways...  ELVIS ($9): Yummy! There was way too much peanut butter for me though so I did scrape some off and I thought that the bacon and maple syrup were all great flavors together. BYOB($4?): They charge you per glass you use. So we brought orange juice and champagne for our own mimosas and were charged for the 4 glasses. No problems there, I was too scared to open the champagne at the table so I asked the waiter to help us and they opened it in the kitchen.  Our food was tasty, but we had problems with the customer service. We weren't checked on very much, and actually ended up staying past closing or close to closing (3pm) because we were waiting around for a server but ended up waving another girl down because our original server seemed to have abandoned us..  I would like to note that they do not have tap/filtered water here and serve small water bottles at a fee.  I would like to return! But the service was slow when there weren't many customers on the patio.",

I have been twice, both were very pleasant experiences. Only complaint (if you could call it that) is that food can be a bit slow to arrive if the place is busy. Service is extremely friendly however, so they were attentive throughout the meal. One of my favorite quaint brunch spots in the city!",

European owner could care less about customer service/or being remotely friendly.  I once walked in and was ignored for 15 minutes until I walked to the back of the restaurant and found the owner messing with his phone in the kitchen. Again, felt like I was bothering him to make me a sandwich.   Once ordered mocha french toast, they make it completely covered in nutella, way too much nutella, it was disgusting.  Even after scraping all of it off, I still felt sick from all the sugar. You can see pictures of it in the photos section.   One positive is that their sandwiches are very tasty and the bread is amazing.",

I loved J'eet, so I was happy to see they kind of stuck with the same crepe theme, but added much more.    The french toast is to die for - and the portion is VERY generous!  The plate of fruit is very large as well and displayed nicely.  Ours was apples, pears, bananas and oranges.  The omlette was delicious and so was the brie apple crepe.  No complaints at all!  I'm no coffee snob by any means, but I thought their coffee was top notch as well.  Everyone seemed very friendly and helpful, but not annoying -- my type of servers!   My sister and I left very full and happy with our time there.  A huge plus is the beautiful back patio too.  I would def suggest going here when it's nice out and you can sit outside.

    "text": "Cafe Monna is another breakfast/brunch spot in the Bloomfield corridor that flies under the radar.  Breakfast is without a doubt the most important meal out of any. This being said, the varieties in breakfast fare from culinary adventurous, to hip and chic, to greasy spoon leave a diversity in the class of breakfast and brunch themed resteraunts or events.  To me, it is like Best Picture overall, Foreign Language film of the year, or Best RomComnotstarringSethRoganOrBradleyCooper.  Caffe Monna is its own niche. They can really develop this into something fantastic with their real estate. They have a quaint inside, and sidewalk seating. The outside porch is magnificent. Kudos for outside spaces that make our flighty Pgh sunny days all the more wonderful.  CM has a hipsterish vibe, and there is nothing wrong with that. Their menu is succinct and their coffee mugs large. The prixe fix menu is very reasonable on price, as are most of their options. They could use a few more meat and taters options though, as potatoes, to me, are the hallmark of a good brunch.  I ordered the Elvis Crepe and my girlfriend ordered the French toast. My crepe was somewhat dull and had too much peanut butter. The simplicity that is a perfect crepe was betrayed by the lack of balance in the ingredients. A crepe with bacon, bananas and peanut butter can be made a lot more interesting. The PB should be a very delicate spread though.  My girlfriends french toast with fig preserve and brie was quite good. The fig preserve could have been made better as a fig syrup.  If CM steps their culinary game up just a tad, they could be a repeat spot pretty easily. I don't think this would take too much on their part.",

I've only even been for breakfast but everything I've gotten has been great. I'm a huge fan of the bagel sandwiches--not your average breakfast sammie! The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are so delicious. My favorite is the veggie sandwich, with balsamic and creamy cheese (on an everything bagel!) They also come with a tasty little side salad. Coffee is a great and the refills are plentiful! One drawback is that they're not open very late (close at 3pm or 4pm). The service for me has also been hit or miss, which can hinder the experience but overall I think it's a great hidden gem right on Penn Ave.",

    "text": "I recently brunched here with Yelp's own delightful and insightful Angela B.  We arrived around noon and were seated right away. Caffe Mona has a very welcoming decor, with tiny tables, light wood tones, and a beautiful exposed brick wall. The layout itself is very cozy, and delicious smells overwhelmed me as our friendly server handed us our menus. We both decided to go for the prix fixe brunch selection, which included soup, salad or a fruit plate to start. We both chose the fruit which was a decent selection of sliced apples, pears and bananas. Nothing super special, but perfect for nibbling while waiting for our second course. I ordered the fig and apple French toast, which was supposed to be served with fig jam, Brie cheese and Granny Smith apples. I was told by our server that they were all out of fig jam, and my heart sunk a little. He offered a substitute of apricot jam, which I accepted, although it didn't sound nearly as amazing. It was a yummy dish, the Brie was melty, creamy and gooey, the apples (even though I had just had some with my fruit plate) were a tart and crisp contrast to the sweetness of the apricot jam. I ate every bite with content. The third course consisted of a crepe with either strawberry or apricot preserves. I got strawberry, as I had already sampled the apricot. The crepe was a little crisper than I would expect a traditional crepe to be. Stiff, almost. The strawberry preserves were nice, however, and by this point I was full anyway. All in all, a pleasant meal and would certainly go back to try other menu items.  So why only 3 stars? The music was simply awful! It was unnecessarily loud, it was difficult to hear my dining companion because we were seated underneath a speaker. The loudness might not have been such an issue if they had played something that didn't make me cringe. It was like some created a Dave Matthews Band Pandora station and just kept hitting \"like\". Well, we didn't enjoy the onslaught of Mumford & Sons, Jack Johnson and DMB that polluted our lovely brunch. I'd be happy to make Caffe Mona some more appropriate playlists...trust me, they need the help. This is very important for an enjoyable dining experience!",

    "text": "My review is based on the overall experience of the place. My friend and I went on a Sunday a little after noon. It was not very crowded inside, but the patio was full. We ended up sitting at a high top table, which was fine. It took them awhile to tell us whether or not they had outside seating available. So that was weird.   I ordered the potato Mona styles eggs. The eggs came with a small piece of toasted bread and a tiny salad. The salad dressing was delicious (balsamic) and the lettuce and tomatoes were incredibly fresh. I would have been ok sacrificing some eggs for more salad. The eggs were also really interesting and tasty. There was a little bit too much cheese on the eggs but I still thought it was yummy. I loved the bread and wish it had been larger!  The experience was overall not pleasant, though. They seemed short staffed. The guy at the front seemed incredibly stressed and frazzled. I think there was a family there that really frazzled the staff. They kept going behind the counter and preparing their own drinks! It was really weird. So I understand that the annoying family was not the staff's fault, but their annoyance was translating onto other customers like us. The guy was clearly not handling it well and it showed. Again, this was really not their fault because that family was so obnoxious!  I would maybe go again if I had a patio seat. I feel like all that frenzied activity would have been shielded from us had we been outside. So, while the food was excellent, the service was very uncomfortable.  I would say it was just a bad day! So that's why I'll still give four stars. I docked a star for the staff experience.",

    "text": "I went here with my family for Breakfast. We had a reservation, but had to wait for a table to open up for us, which kind of defeats the purpose of a reservation. A group with the same amount of people was in line in front of us when we entered. They didn't have a reservation and were seated right away at an empty table. That table should have been saved for our reservation instead of given to a walk-in.   My husband and mother ordered the mocha french toast. I had the Brentwood bagel sandwich. The French toast was drenched in chocolate. It was too much. Way too heavy. The toast was supposed to be infused with espresso, but there wasn't the slightest hint of any coffee-like flavoring. My husband said he tasted some of the toast without the chocolate coating and it was flavorless. This dish had a lot of potential to be amazingly delicious, but it fell flat.  My Brentwood sandwich wasn't nearly as big of a miss as the mocha french toast, but it still was lacking. I got the Everything bagel and the sandwhich description said it was bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. The only complaint I have is that there was barely any avocado. They used mashed avocado instead of slices, and they swiped a nearly undetectable amount on the bread. It was kind of disappointing since I'm a big fan of avocado! With such a weak amount, the sandwich could have really used some mayo or something to help counter the dryness of all the other ingredients.   Besides the food, the service was a little slow and it took quite a while for our food to come out. They only had two servers working though so I could understand that they may have been a little short staffed.   Overall, I don't know if I'd visit again. Maybe to try the crepes, but I doubt it.",

They make a great quality brunch, and the mocha French toast is amazing.   But the service would get two stars - and even that might be generous.   Others have mentioned this, but the waitstaff at this restaurant is so profoundly unfriendly and unwelcoming that we began to wonder if we were on a hidden cam reality show. We walked in and the staff person (possibly the owner, based on comments - a middle aged man with glasses) literally stared and BLINKED at us until he finally said, \"Breakfast?\" Not, welcome....or hello...or anything like that.   Our waitress in the summer was the same way. No words, no pleasantries, nothing. I don't need anyone to slop on fake pleasantries, but c'mon folks. A few basics, please!  Seriously, we felt as if we were imposing on them by being there. As a native, I know we Pittsburghers can be no-nonsense, blunt, and to the point, but either this place is being run by a staff comprised solely of people who are living with Asperger's, or they're just plain rude and unfriendly.",

I didn't know where it came from, but apparently my friend pointed out that it used to be J'eet.    It's really very homey inside.  I love the wood accents and casual feel.  What drew me in was a promise of fabulous french toast.  That promise was kept thankfully!  I love a good prix fixed menu and for $13.99 you can get three courses of breakfast goodness!    First course was a fruit dish.  It was actually a plate full of apples, pears and watermelon.  Way bigger than I thought and fresh to boot.  The second course I choose the fig, apple and brie french toast.  The fig was baked into a large slice of french toast while the brie was melted on top adorned with a couple thinly sliced pieces of apple.  It was incredibly tasty and had a plentiful amount of fig!    If the air issue is cleared up I'd happily hunker myself down here for a afternoon work sesh.  They offer free wifi and we even had a dude sitting next to us with his laptop out, so I feel like they're welcome to workers.    The last course was an apricot preserve on a crepe.  The apricot was so so good!  It's definitely something you're not going to get everywhere.  I may have thought it was a lot of bread if they hadn't served that huge plate of fruit, so thanks for not making me feel guilty Caffe Mona!  The one complaint is that it was hot as Hades inside.  Like the oven's been on all day and we don't have a strong enough air conditioner/don't have one on at all hot.  It was pretty uncomfortable so good thing the food was a win or I may have been outta there by the first course!  As long as they get that under control I'd return.    Looks like they're welcoming to workers considering they offer free wifi and we were sitting right next to a busy little worker bee next to us.  So pump that air and I'll spend the day ordering up some delish food and have a nice little work day!",

Last course was a strawberry preserve crepe which was my favorite of the dishes.  My only complaints are that is was quite hot inside, and it felt a bit smoky from the close proximity to the kitchen.  Give them a shot. No wait, and a lot of food for not too much money.",

When I asked for tap water, they told me that they stopped using tap water because of a bacteria in the water the previous month (how do they wash the dishes?). They brought me a very small 8 oz bottle of water. I said I would need another bottle of water, and the waiter said ok. 20 minutes later the water hadn't arrived, so I got up and asked for it (I was the only person in the restaurant). Then they charged me for the bottled waters. When I mentioned it was strange that they were charging for water given that they didn't have the tap water option that I asked for, they said sorry but I'd still need to pay. Strange and not good first experience, which is too bad because they have a beautiful back deck.",

I was always happy with my experiences prior to the change, but since that, everything has seemed to have gone down hill.  Take out orders seem to take way longer now (even when u call a few hours in advance), they have been \"out\" of basic items making me change my order on multiple occasions, and their coffee drinks were less than impressive.    Not worth the $ being spent here... I think for what you get the costs are too high as well.",

We were standing next to another family who was waiting to be seated and looking at the advertisements on the wall. The curly haired waiter came over to tell them a table was ready. The woman, who was cleary older, did not hear him. So, the waiter decides to say \"whatever\" in such an annoyed tone, and walks away. I was so shocked at how rude he was to this family!

I came here with a group of friends and we were all pretty underwhelmed by both the options on the menu and the quality of the food. Additionally, the prices are pretty unreasonable for the area. One of my friends discovered the cheapest way to get full was to order two bagel sandwiches rather than a bagel combo. I also couldn't wrap my head around the salad dressing they use -- it was way too acidic and really overpowered my meal. I guess the eclectic decor in the patio somewhat reminds me of my time in Paris, but in a cheesy way.   Probably worth checking out if you're in the area due to a lack of other hipster brunch places, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "We get a menu from this place a few weeks ago in the mail (we live within walking distance). We have been wanting to try it for a while so we figured we would call for take-out around noon on a Sunday. I should have known as soon as I called that the situation would end as it did.   1. When I called and said I wanted a take-out order, she seemed a little confused but continued (you can order from Grubhub so one would assume they are set up for take-out). I ordered a bagel sandwich, no problem there. Then I ordered 1 slice of plain French toast, and that was confusing and asked what toppings I wanted (plain French toast...), then lastly I ordered a crepe that \"was no longer on the menu\" (in case you forgot, we got this menu in the mail just a few weeks ago...). So I ordered a different one. She said 20-25 minutes so I was hopeful.   2. 30 minutes later (trying to give them longer than they said to prep), I walk in and one of the girls says \"oh let me tell the kitchen you are here, they are very  busy\". For context, there were multiple open tables inside, definitely not as busy as they could be. She comes back and says another 10-15 minutes. Cmon, that's 45 minutes after I called to get 3 simple items ready. But, we were hungry so I went right outside to wait.   3. Walk back inside 10 minutes later, she says \"oh we're out of mushrooms, you'll have to pick another crepe, they tried to come find you but you weren't around\". (I was standing right outside the place waiting, no one came to find me). She then said it would be another 10 minutes (this would be almost an hour since I called). And I just said cancel the whole thing.   If you're still reading, morale of the story is don't make the same mistake we did and try to order take-out. Can't speak for how the food is, since we canceled it. It's quite a shame too, as we could have been repeat customers, living so close to it.",

Whether you want to just eat at a beautiful place, go on brunch dates with friends and family, or relax by yourself, Caffe Mona is the place to be.   Many of the menu options can be made vegetarian for people like myself and they are really, really good! My personal favorite and hidden gem is the Spanikopita French toast with the Nutella Banana Crepe and a Chai Tea Latte. I suggest the Brunch Special (three course meal with a drink for $20) if you want to get the most bang for your buck. The portion sizes are just perfect and filling as well.   Being a server, I noticed that the customers especially liked the Berries French Toast, Protein Omelette, V Bagel, and Melted Sandwich.   Eto and Caner, the owners, are also one of the most generous and charismatic people I know. The food is truly exceptional as well. I enjoyed every shift I worked because of the relaxed work environment and trying out new menu options at the end of my shift.   All in all Caffe Mona is an aesthetic and artsy place with many regulars and addicting food that is perfect for any occasion.",

The food was pretty much as expected and the prices were reasonable.  Our only issue with the place was that the service was not great. Our server seemed very impatient in taking our order and tried to take away plates before we were done eating multiple times. When we received the receipt, we realized we were charged for water, which we didn't order. We explained to our server that the water was already set up for us on the table when we walked in and we didn't realize it was not free.

Our meal was decent, but nothing was good enough for us to want to try again.  Crepes were well made though.",

We ordered 2 plain crepes for our 3 year old, a Cobb salad for me and a buffalo chicken crepe with a salad for my husband. I asked for strawberries on the side for the crepes and was happy to see avocado on the Cobb salad description. I ordered a $3 ice tea. Our food was brought in a short amount of time. The plain crepes arrived as French toast. The Cobb salad was lacking avocado and had gross turkey deli meat laid over the top. I instantly recognized it from Costco. I dug into the salad and found the avocado.... dollops of Costco guacamole. I tried to eat around it but it was smeared on all the half wilted greens. My husband's crepe was fine. The salad was just greens and vinaigrette. My daughter's erred French toast was fine but not worth the cost of the meal. My ice tea was never refilled, no one checked on our meals, and the bill was $50. What a waste.",

The three of us each had a cappuccino, one regular, one a little dry, and mine as bone dry. All three were clearly made differently and exactly as we wanted and ended up ordering one more each to finish off our breakfast, which leads to the food. We're vegetarians and got the Goat omelette, the Veggie egg sandwich and the Mocha French Toast. All were quite tasty and the French toast was pleasantly NOT cloyingly sweet.  Service was a little on the slow side, but that was because he spent so much time on each of our coffees. Had we not ordered dry caps, I'm sure it wouldn't have even been noticeable.",

Yes, parking isn't great. Keep circling the streets of Bloomfield until you find a spot. If you're lucky, one of the few spots out front will be open.   You can sit outside at the counter window, inside or head straight to the back patio, which is exactly what we did. It was a super hot day, but the umbrella's give off the perfect amount of shade.   The most important thing to know is it's BYOB! In addition to a mimosa I have to have a chai latte and here I had both! Don't be stressed when you look over the menu... you'll certainly be torn between the sweet and savory options. We did one of each! I'd do the exact same thing next time I go. They have so much to pick from you'll never need to repeat your order.  If you've been putting off trying this place, don't. It's a must visit.",

This place was a great call. it looked like a secret spot at first because I am not that familiar with Pittsburgh, haha!!   The food was great. We had pretty much everything on the menu, we were a group of 6 and we love sharing.   Also, coffee was fabulous as well! We had black coffee which was served well and they were really good with refilling our coffee at no extra charge.   More importantly, the staff was really friendly and service was casual, fun, and fast!!! We got to meet and talk to everybody works there. YES!!! the staff was that amazing!  We also sat outside and enjoyed our brunch. I still can't get over how cute & fabulous their outdoor patio is. Highly recommended!! This place is easily getting a 5 star.",

Gave us the option of the smallest water bottle for 50 cents or a bacterial infection. Their words not mine. Member in our party was given coffee with flakes in it. Asked for a new cup. While up their he asked how they made their coffee. It's was with the tap. They also filled up a bowl for a dog with tap water. Nice gesture but isn't that dog going to get sick? Some of our food was tasteless. Some was really good. Not worth the $70 we spent for 6 people. Would have rather of gotten fast food for $20  I fully understand the 50 cent bottles over not wanting to give out free water. Totally a cash grab. I would be ok with it too if they were honest about it. They either lied to us about the tap water or got a dog and everyone drinking coffee sick. Either way I don't support going here",

    "text": "My friends and I went here for brunch on a Tuesday. We chose to sit on the back deck because it was a nice day- and of course we wanted to see the legendary umbrellas!   I ordered \"The Melted\" sandwich which is chicken, pesto, mozzarella, and tomato. The sandwich was pretty good, but I wish the cheese would've been melted a little bit more. I think it would have been a better sandwich if it was pressed as a panini instead! The sandwich came with a side salad and a few sour cream and cheddar chips. Personally, there wasn't enough dressing on the salad for me, but it was filled with delicious, leafy greens.   The owner (I think) was very kind. He offered to take pictures of us and brought us a free dessert of eclairs which I felt was extremely thoughtful!   The biggest problem I had was the fact that they only serve mini bottles of water and you have to pay $0.50 for each bottle! I am a big water drinker and have no problem drinking from the tap, but here I was forced to pay for my water. I only drank two bottles, but in all actuality, I wanted to drink about 4.",

I had the Philly steak crepe and enjoyed it although I feel like it was missing something like an egg or maybe some type of sauce or drizzle of something and my boyfriend had the turkey bagel. For dessert we got a strawberry Nutella crepe that I guess also came with blueberries. I also had a latte and double shot of espresso. All was good, however the water situation was weird. You have to pay for water and you only get a little Kirkland bottle with like 6 oz in it. It just struck me as strange and not very eco friendly, I hope they recycle. The other thing was, while it was not crowded while we were there, the outdoor seating is really smushed together and if it was busier we would have been sitting right on top of another person.",

If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been yet, I encourage you to check it out! They have delicious food, great coffee, and a lovely atmosphere. The inside is decorated very nicely and the outside patio is so fun with the umbrellas. I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table either, which is great for me as I usually decide that morning if I'm going out for breakfast or not. The staff is also very kind! They recently updated their menu, too. Ordering tip: go with a friend and split a sweet and savory crepe!",

    "text": "Service was not good. The staff seems very disorganized. No free water.  I came for a Sunday brunch with four others and while we arrived at a busy time, we were told to go to the back porch for seats, only to find there weren't any, and then redirected back inside to a table. Please have the courtesy to check for your guests instead of pushing them around!  After sitting down, we examined the menu as we were handed small bottles of water. Apparently on the menu it said that these bottles were 50 cents each. I didn't want to be charged so I asked for tap water, but my bill on the end included the price for my water bottle, even though I did not open it.  We placed our orders with our waitress, who seemed to be new. She was taking a while looking at my menu to write down the exact item names of what we were ordering. She almost hit me in the face with the menus when she was collecting them. She however was kind in handling our requests, especially when my friend kept asking her to refill the hot water in her tea.   The food came out in maybe 15 minutes. It was decent, nothing too special or exciting. The portions were of varying size, the largest being the omelette. Not sure if the bagels were worth their prices. The salmon bagel itself had only one slice of salmon. The chai latte my friend ordered was actually a dirty chai. I thought the side salads were good though, and that the feta and honey crepe was interesting. I had never had something like it before.  Overall, I don't think I would come back. The food wasn't outstanding enough for me to overlook the other problems I encountered. I do admit that the porch is very aesthetic, with all the colorful umbrellas hanging overhead. If anything, I think that will attract people looking for a good social media post.",

They open early and have a lot of choices of seating. I sat on the back patio which was off the street and nice and quite and had such cute decorations with the umbrellas and yard things.  My waiter was very friendly and I ordered first an iced chai tea latte that was delicious with just the right amount of cinnamon on top. I then ordered a ham and Brie crepe for my meal that came with a side salad that was delicious! I was content when I left but stayed a while I read my book. Staff didn't rush me out or anything which was nice so I got to take my time sipping and eating. Would love to come here again and try something else off of their wonderful menu!",

Myself in particular got the meat omelette consisting of bacon, ham, and chicken. You think that would be too much meat, but it all balanced out with the consistency of the omelette. The Berry French Toast was fresh and fluffy.  This place is great for small groups, and intimate affairs. Management is great/friendly and has a patio in the back for the summer time.

The restaurant space is very nice, try to sit outside if you can (they have a cool umbrella display). Our waitress Emma was great. Their menu has a good mix of sweet and savory options, the crepes come both ways. I had the buffalo chicken crepe which was great though the salad that came with it was kind of blah. I tried someone else's berries and crepes, it was fantastic. Prices are reasonable. One thing that was a little strange and that I'd wish they change is that they don't have tap water, they give you little Costco water bottles which they charge you for.",

It's small and cozy, and it kind of seems family-run, which only further endears itself to me.   I don't know what it's like on a weekend (possibly much busier), but on a weekday during the summer, it was just what I needed.",

The combination of cheese, mushrooms, and onion hit the spot. The French toast however, needed more sweetness maybe if they carmelized the apples it would of helped. However, I did appreciate the amount of brie cheese they use on the French toast.   As for service it was not the best even though there were only two other people there with us. Price wise it was okay. One downfall was we asked for water with our coffee and got small bottels which I thought was nice until I seen on our bill that we got charged for it. A bit ridiculous to me.",

    "text": "Thank you fellow Yelpers for making me aware of this one! I never would have imagined such a place existed! And it's not obvious by looking at the place that such wonderful food resides inside that door. We intended to try Coca Cafe for brunch but the line was far too long so we decided, based on Yelp reviews, to go up the hill and try Caffe Mona since it was so close. WOW. Amazing. The place is small but it has a deck out back that, in good sunny weather, offers a great place to sit, relax, and enjoy some good food.  Great menu selections include a prix fix 3 course brunch for $13.99 - includes unlimited coffee, a fresh fruit plate (tons of fruit!), and entree, and a dessert crepe. That's what we chose but I don't think we could have gone wrong with anything on that menu. I got the Mediterranean omelet which was done to perfection with peppers, olives and feta cheese. My wife got the savory French toast with brie, fig preserves, and slices of granny smith apples on a thick piece of French toast. She claims this may have been the best breakfast dish she's ever had. I tried it (imagine that!) and concur - it truly was amazing. People next to us got the berry stuffed French toast which, I admit, I drooled over. Even with a full stomach I would have taken a bite if they had offered. He couldn't finish his and took half home.  The crepe was the only disappointment - it tasted like it had been made ahead of time and was a little hard. I know crepes and they should be thin, served warm, and not crunchy in the least. I'm willing to forgive it since by the time that was served, I could barely eat another bite. All in all it was a great place. GREAT place. I'm ready to go back.",

We were the first customers for brekkie on Sunday and the wait for our food was a little longer than most places. However, that wasn't an issue because our meals were clearly prepared with a pride and passion for food. We started with a cheese plate that came with a crepe and marmalade and that could have been a shared meal itself. For main courses I had the pesto crepe with side salad and my boyfriend had the Polish Hill crepe with a side salad. You guessed it, his was similar to eating a pierogi with cheese, mashed potatoes and caramelized onions. I had s bite and it just melted in my mouth. And for me how can you go wrong with a pesto crepe? It literally tasted straight from the garden with fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and the most fragrant basil. Service was very good and the interior is quaint, inviting and comfortable. They've even got a back dining patio. Everything about this place reminded me of Europe without trying too hard. It's a theme that flows organically throughout. Also want to mention that the menu has so many choices without being overwhelming or too much to take in.",

Additionally, I don't like french toast that's topped with fried egg, I prefer dipped in batter french toast. The waitress was very pleasant and dutiful. Before I conclude, allow me to share an oddity, the waitress unprompted brought us two small bottled waters, and to our surprise, a cost for the same appeared on the bill.

My daughter took me for birthday brunch and even though the menu is not as large as during the week, there were a lot of choices on the menu  Everything was fresh, tastefully prepared and presented. The service was great( not sure where everybody's coming from with complaints of slow or non-existent service, not this day) . For sure we will be returning there!!",

We were seated right away and the jerk chicken crepe that I ordered arrived quick and was fairly tasty.   The second was a weekend brunch:  The cafe was semi-full but one table and the bar seating were available. We were seated quickly and ordered soon  after -- so far so good.  Then came the wait. We waited for over 45 minutes for two orders of French toast - one savory and one sweet.  When they finally arrived, they were disappointing.  The berry topping on mine was half frozen.  My wife did not care for her spanakopita French toast.  In summary:  Not a bad choice for a quick lunch, but I recommend looking elsewhere when it comes to brunch.",

They have a great selection of crepes, omelettes, French toast, and bagels (and everything that we saw and tried was generously portioned). We tried the monte cristo french toast  and the mocha french toast and shared the Nutella and banana crepe to finish. Everything was delicious, and fairly priced. Etto, the owner, even came by to introduce himself and chat for a while, making our experience even more enjoyable. Overall, we had a great time and definitely plan on going back.",

Cafe Mona La Bistro was at the top of the list and I saw a pic of the outdoor seating which I thought was cool because I'm always looking for places with outdoor seating in the summer. I checked out the menu and it seemed like a great place. It seemed to have a bit of healthy and comfort foods on the menu.   I walked in and it looked like a nice little place. I grabbed a menu and sat down. A minute later the guy at the counter greeted me and got me a coffee and a mini bottle of water. I ordered the protein omelette which had Black Forest turkey, ham, and bacon with Swiss cheese. I asked for Gouda instead of Swiss and asked if they had sides to order. The guy didn't seem to understand me so I asked if they had breakfast potatoes. He said, \"Yes we have potatoes, do you want some?\" I said yes. Waited about 15 minutes and they came to my table with my omelette and a plate of French fries with a Cajun or Old Bay seasoning on top. I said I wanted potatoes not fries but was told that was the only type of potatoes they had. No big deal, but I know not to order potatoes next time unless I want fries.   I went to eat my omelette and noticed the omelette had Swiss cheese on it. I hate Swiss cheese but understand this is how it is on the menu so I know mistakes happen. They offered to remake it but I was in a hurry so I said I'll just eat it. The omelette was delicious. Would've been better with Gouda or the fresh mozzarella but even with Swiss it was good. Fries were baked instead of fried and they were good too. Only reason I gave  this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the fries and Swiss cheese. They charged me 1/2 price for the mistake since I didn't want them to remake it.   I'll definitely come back again. One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh",

Coffee is a necessity in my life, and it definitely complimented my sweet meal.  The outside deck pays a sweet homage to the \"umbrellas\" of the three rivers arts festival by their own exhibit of multi-colored hanging umbrellas. It was perfect for the sunny day- just enough colorful coverage!  Caffe Mona does not disappoint- I can't wait to return soon!  Next time I hope to try a savory crepe - the buffalo chicken crepe looked delicious.",

    "text": "So I was pleasantly surprised by this place when I arrived. I thought this was just a little coffee shop that served simple breakfast items such as bagels. Boy, was I was I wrong. I had no idea this place had a lovely deck out back with rainbow colored umbrellas.  This place was very inviting and the staff was super friendly. I came in with my husband on Memorial Day for brunch and opted for the outdoor seating area.  Their menu was quite varied, and ranged from your typical omelettes, to some really intriguing sweet and salty crepes.  They had a $20 brunch special which I highly recommend, you can pick your choice of fruit or salad, your entree, followed by one of their sweet crepes: nutella and banana, strawberry and apricot, or feta and honey. I opted for the salad, the Philly crepe, and the feta and honey desert crepe.   We were served their coffee with is some strong delicious stuff, I usually have a ton of coffee when it's unlimited, but I totally met my coffee quota here. Really good stuff. The food itself was excellent. My salad had some spring greens and sliced tomato with this incredible creamy vinaigrette sauce. Despite the simplicity, it was excellent. My entree was really good, it was basically a cheese steak filling, with roasted peppers, caramelized onions and Gorgonzola cheese. This stuffed crepe was enormous and quite delicious. My husband had the Mediterranean omelette which had olives, roasted peppers, onions, and feta. This omelette was really well balanced and I loved the tang that the feta added.  For dessert, the honey feta crepe was really good, not overly sweet. Excellent desert.    Overall I was very happy to stumble upon this place. I can't wait to return, especially since you can bring your own Champagne for mimosas!!",

I finally came here this past Sunday afternoon for brunch with some friends. We made reservations prior and we're seated right away. They have a beauuutiful patio with hanging umbrellas!!! Unfortunately due to the size of our group we were not able to be seated out there :(  They have a $20 3-course brunch special which is so worth the price! For first course you can get a salad or plate of fruit, second course you can get any entree on the menu (omelette, French toast, crepes, bagels, sandwich), and for third course you get a crepe (Nutella banana, strawberry or apricot). Also included in the deal is a latte/cappuccino, or unlimited coffee/tea.  I got the fruit plate (so much fruit!), Mediterranean omelette, and the Nutella banana crepe with a soy latte. Everything was so delicious! And the food was plentiful (they didn't skimp considering it was a 3-course). My only criticism is it took a bit of time for our food to come out, but we were a group of 7 so I will attribute some of it to that. Overall, friendly, interactive staff and good food!",

All were excellent, but they were all brought out at the same time which really doesn't fit the 3 course bistro marketing of this place.    So if you come on a nice sunny Sunday for brunch, be prepared for so-so service.  We waited a long time for someone to take order and for the food to arrive.  Once it arrived, we never saw the server again.  We had to go to the front to pay and our server had to ticket for us, we had to remind him what we ordered and he figured it out.  We will be back because the food is so excellent, but maybe on a day that is not so busy.",

Last time I got Nutella Banana Crepe, Vanilla Latte and Turkish coffee. The presentation on everything was so pretty! My crepe came up like bouquet of flowers, latte was topped with heart shaped foam and Turkish coffee was served in tiny cute cup! Everything was served hot and I really enjoyed my brunch!   So this is definitely nice place to have breakfast and brunch!",

It was really hard to pick though because everything sounded really good lol. Also, the atmosphere is really lovely, so is the staff. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "I would not even give this one star. my experience was horrible! we went for lunch as soon as I entered the place the server  asked me \"what can I do for you?\" obviously I was not wondering in a park or lost some where. we were there to have food. This guy was rude from the beginning. it took him some time to come to our table. finally we ordered but it took more than half an hour before I went to ask how much more do we have to wait for the food. he replied rudely \"how long has it been since you ordered \". And at that point I asked him that I would need to contact the owner of the place.  apparently the guy in the kitchen was the owner. he couldn't care less either and said it would be at least 10 more minutes if not longer. Made no effort to rectify or solve the issue. After we saw this 'take it or leave it 'attitude, we just left and went some where else. if you are looking for bad service and attitude this is the place to go. With other places next door that offer good food and excellent service, this place will close again! Apparently, this place had another name before. Either a new name or management.  Good luck buddy !",

I had a spinach French Toast that was exceptional, as savory French Toast was something of a new experience and the Chili was good enough that I ordered a second portion to take with me on the long drive home.  I'm looking forward to making this a regular stop when I visit the Childrens' Hospital across the street.  I spoke at great length with the owner, who was very interested in customer feedback, as was the chef, who told me a lot about how she selected a real artisenal bakery with fresh deliveries.",

If you're looking for a place to simply get a well brewed cup of coffee look no further. While you may not want to linger in the indoor dining space due to the peculiar odors wafting from the kitchen at the back of the building, the service is impeccable and this is an excellent quick-stop for coffee and a sandwich.",
