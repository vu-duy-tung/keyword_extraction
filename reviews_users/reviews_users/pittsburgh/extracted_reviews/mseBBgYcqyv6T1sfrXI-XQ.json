    "text": "My brother Tim and his wife hand picked this restaurant for our family for a sad family reunion.   Being from the Northwest now where I may be a little more snippy in my reviews, my expectations of a restaurant with the front being a bar were not that high for the food. My spirits were down and dismal, but as family ordered drinks, I was able to order a Samuel Adams Octoberfest from tap to start off with. The waitress identified the chef had created appetizers \"on the house\" for us to enjoy before our meals arrived. We munched on specialty stuff (I will just say you gotta go there to find out) and then our meals arrived. My Dad had recommended the steak sandwich, but I opted for the \"special\" as my younger brother did, which was flank steak with roasted potatoes. When my meal arrived and I looked at it, first impression was to get a bottle of A1 Steak Sauce to smother it in. I thought best not to insult my family and the chef, so instead I took a small bite of the flank steak without anything else. The result- my mouth went into a savory overload!! I cannot recall in my life.. yes I said it, life of having so much perfect flavor from a flank steak. The steak had been no doubt marinated, sliced at a 45 degree angle with just the right amount of redness for a medium rare. The roasted potatoes- fabulous!! I had ordered sides of onions and peppers only to annoy my older sister for the ride home in her vehicle (Ya'll get the picture).   Bottom line- excellent beer selection, great privacy for family functions and EXCELLENT STAFF and top honors to the Chef.",

Once inside we were greeted by Rene, who asked if it was our 1st time here, as they know all the regulars here, and there were many that night... We got seated and ourlooked at our  menus and I'd say the cuisine is bar food,which is always a good thing. There appeared to be a nice variety of dinners one could order, but we kept it simple and went for sandwiches...At Rene's suggestion, I tried the Reubin and my wife got a veggie wrap..Both came with dry rubbed chips (a 1st for us) and these were to die for. As we watched Rene and another lady who was working interact with the others there, we know this place thrives on repeat business and they sure deserve it..Although we live too far from here to be regulars, we WILL stop here on our drives up to Pittsburgh..Heck, the dry rubbed chips alone are worth stopping for, never mind the whole rest of the meal...",

In True Yinzer fashion we ordered pierogies as our appetizer.  They are sauteed in butter and delicious.  My wife ordered the steak sandwich and was pleasantly suprised by how tender the meat was because it was a flat iron style, not shredded like a Philly Cheese Steak.  I ordered the orzo pasta in a homemade chicken broth and it was excellent.  This chef has taken comfort food to the next level!  Contrary to some reports, Tavern 51 accepts credit cards (Visa or Mastercard) now.  This is quite a find.  My wife and I ate for under $50 including tip and two glasses of wine.",

    "text": "Note 1: CASH ONLY. You'll see an ATM as you walk in.   Note 2: Their kitchen closes an hour to an hour and a half prior to the listed closing time.   On Friday evening (the 10th), I found myself with some money (payday!) and in the car of my girlfriend who picked me up from work and reluctantly agreed to eat here before she whisked me away to her place wayyyy out in the boonies. Yes, I was kidnapped, willingly  This unassuming place (it looks like a renovated home and have no idea how long its been here as it took a while for me to notice it), is as noisy as Kaib's in Mt. Washington! Man, the neighborhood locals (mostly people in their 40's-50's this trip) were feelin' good and loud on a Friday night. Big screen TV's showed college football games with people ooohing, ahhhing, and essentially whoopin' it up.   Now, because it is somewhat rowdy, it may not be the kind of place you want to go to, but if you choose not to go, you'll possibly be missing out on some dandy food.   Mostly serving typical bar fare (think burgers, sandwiches, wings, etc.) Tavern 51 also offers more upscale items such as Chicken Marsala, Vegetable Orzo, Pepper Encrusted Salmon, and Shrimp Scampi (!), all prepared by the mysterious Chef Tom.   Eschewing the gourmet, Darren the Burger Slayer advanced his campaign.  Their 8oz. Black Angus Burger, served with the best homemade potato chips I've had to date, and a pale-on-the-inside, crunchy, cold dill pickle (which means it ruled) , was more than a match for my appetite. However, I felled the ground beefbeast like Tessaro's and Cheeburger Cheeburger's before. It's hearty, charred, and checks off all the boxes in terms of burger quality control. It was just what I needed to finish my week. Please, golf claps are in order for this fine specimen of burgerdom. You won't be left wanting.   I tasted my date's BBQ Salmon Salad and began to regret my life's vocation as hunter and killer of burgers because it was that tasty. The salmon might as well have been ice cream, because you guessed it, it melted in my mouth (how many ways can you say it?).  The viniagrette it was dressed with took me to Heaven faster than a...  Whoa! Let's keep it PG.   How could I forget our pre-meal munchie? They call it the Cheesy Bacon Pretzel Stick, which is a phat Sahs Syde-style doughrod that is stuffed with cheddar cheese and bound in bacon. Horseradish mustard is supplied for dipping, but this newfangled thing really didn't need it. They split it in two for us. Awww. Or as Pittsburgh girls say, \"Oooohawwww.\" Ya gotta hear 'em say it.   We also shared a slice of apple pie, which they get from Signature Desserts in Castle Shannon according to the waitress. That's usually their only dessert offering, but we were told that they sometimes have homemade cheesecake on their menu.   More than decent food + good service (from the excellent Renee)=A place you need to keep an eye out for if you're ever on Clairton Blvd. The menu keeps it from being just another dive bar. Raise a pint for Chef Tom, whoever he is.",

Had a flat iron steak special that looked good, but we honestly never made it past the appetizer menu.  Was going to get a steak sandwich which the people next to me at the bar were eating, but we ended up with the rice poppers - risotto with finely minced jalapeno then fried.  Even the ranch that it's served with works.  Cheesy, crispy, creamy goodness, hits all the right notes.  I think it demands pancetta or bacon, but then everything does.  The bacon wrapped pretzel log with cheese was just OK for me, but my brother liked it.  The mustard it was served with wasn't overpowering, which is often a problem.  Finally, stuffed banana (frying) peppers with tomato sauce.  A great ground beef with cheese another layer of gooey mozzarella and some parmesan on top, broiled and covered in a nice light tomato sauce.  Really excellent.  Sounds strange, but with the exception of the pretzel, reminded me of the kind of food I got in Rome at bars there.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",

    "text": "Upon researching places that got good reviews in our neighborhood, my Bf and I read about this place.  We always wanted to give the steak a try per the reviews.  It was definitely worth the trip.  I ordered the steak special, as we went on a Saturday and my BF ordered a steak salad.  I don't know how they achieved making a flat iron steak so tender.  The veggies and potatoes on the side were sheer perfection too.  And OMG! If you order a salad please try the homemade balsamic dressing.  It was soooo good that I wanted to ask for some to take home.    The food was great, but the waitress was so very pleasant to us.  She also told us to call for specials of the day, as sometimes they offer different things.  She just took her time to make us feel welcome and appreciated even though we weren't there for drinks.  This place is a must try!  I will definitely be back.",

It didn't look like much from the road, and inside, it looks like your typical local bar. But whoever they have working back in the kitchen knows what they're doing. We ordered potstickers, a steak sandwich and a burger. The potstickers were pretty standard. The steak sandwich and burger? Outstanding. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The fresh chips were pretty fantastic, too.  Don't drive past like we had done 100 times before. Go in and try the food. You won't be disappointed.",

The wings were cooked to perfection and the sauce was very respectable (Buffalo extra hot). I got their signature salad on Karen's recommendation with lemon vinaigrette, home run! Fresh potatoes, cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes and grilled chicken and plenty of it. If I am back this way I will stop by again!",

Our waitress was very knowledgeable and welcoming. Nice to know they do not have a microwave in their kitchen. Our experience far exceeded our expectation. We will be back.",

We decided to try four different items from the Small Plates menue. We ordered Green Papaya Salad (all veggies crisp with a tasty Dragon Claw sauce), Warm Miso corn, (the corn is fresh from the cob), Chicken Wings (seven in all, with a sweet and spicy sauce), and the brisket Bao Bun Tacos (fantastic with their veggie garnish).  All excellent and complimented by the Saporo on tap. I strongly recommend Blvd and we will be back soon.  Oh yes, the service is top notch with the most friendly staff. Enjoy!",

It's a great little place for a casual meal and to grab a few drinks.  The place isn't large or fancy but the food was very good and priced were very reasonable.  My husband had a BLT sandwich and wings and enjoyed them both.  My parents both got the chicken marsala and liked it.  I had the vegetable orzo with grilled chicken which is a great choice if you are looking for something a bit lighter.  They have special menu items each day of the week, too.  For dessert we shared pumpkin cheesecake which I immediately regretted agreeing to share because it was very good!   The food takes a little while to come out, but we were told it's because they make everything fresh.",

My date and I decided to roll the dice and give it a try.  Honestly, this was an exceptional meal!  The bar was neighborhood folks but VERY welcoming to us.  The decor is straight-forward/basic, but the food was awesome!  The pierogies were perfect... grandma-homemade good.  My date had the pepper-encrusted salmon and it was cooked perfectly!  She is a picky eater, and she LOVED it.    ...and the prices were incredible!  If you are looking for a great meal at a non-chain, friendly local place, I recommend you find your way to Tavern 51.",

My boyfriend said his flank steak was as tender as filet mignon and he's a chef so he would know. He said he'd rate the flank steak dinner with roasted potatoes a 10!!!! My Italian hoagie was very good. The homemade potato chips were excellent.  Oh and our chicken pot stickers appetizer was yummy. Nice atmosphere. Seems like lots of regulars, everyone friendly! You must try it!",

My favorite is the flat iron steak with mixed vegetables. Omg! The steak is so tender and tasty. The steak sandwich is so good and made to order.
