If you see the Hog Wing's special, get your butt over there and enjoy something different; these are NOT your typical chicken wings!  Brisket, pulled pork and ribs also well worth it.  Bartenders and restaurant staff friendly attentive and helpful.  Owner is making this a successful business and I expect greater things from her.  If you live in the suburbs you want him to expand to your area.  Forget the national chain's blase food, get out of the far burbs, cross the rivers and give it a try.  I guarantee that you'll enjoy your visit!",

Great Italian-style fare, and mainly bar food, but my girlfriend and I felt a bit out of place at the bar.  If I was a die hard sports fan (I am a Pittsburgher, but those days of caring about scores are behind me), I'd probably call this my first choice watering hole.  The bartender was very nice, even though we could not seat ourselves in the dining room due to some sort of restriction (though others were seated there we noticed).  Understandible, however.  The steak \"au jus\" was good, but it was just steak-um style diamond-cut steak like they use in cheesesteaks.  Would love to see real roast beef like they do for you in Brooklyn, rather than the Pittsburgh midwestern knock-off.  Anyway, the meatballs were great and the marinara was very, very nice.  Good place for an honest meal.  There were some exotic/craft beer selections, but it was your basic IC light, Coors light crowd. In younger days, my dad would have liked it.  Had to take Rialto street to get there though -- if you aren't familiar it is one of the world's steepest roads.",

You would think with the name it would be strictly a barbecue restaurant.  Heck, the sign is a neon pig outside.  But the closest thing to barbecue is a pulled pork sandwich.  No ribs here, and the only chicken is wings.  They have pasta, burgers, salads, fish, hoagies and soup. I heard about the meatloaf in this place from the other reviews, and decided to try it.  A large portion of thick sliced meatloaf with gravy and mashed skin on potatoes and gravy.  Filling, but not overly flavorful, but heck, meatloaf is NOT a gourmet food.  Went to the bar after dinner.  Two Jacks and Cokes were $ 8.00 and watched a hockey game with some real knowledgeable Pens fans, who were having discussions over the NHL offsides rules.  So I guess I will call this a kind of sports bar. Looks as if they have specials all week, including a wings special on Thursdays which I am definitely going to try next time back.  Spent $ 30 with tax and tips, and wasn't hungry or thirsty when I left.",

Bartender was really friendly and welcoming A+.. Place seems it would be good for sporting events as well. Now onto the food. I got a dozen wings and 8 cut pizza. Spicy garlic parm wings were definitely good and meaty an the pizza was even better and on par with the top pizza places in pittsburgh.

    "text": "I will give this place the benefit of the doubt and go off my friend's rating of Hog's Head of a 4.5 as well as the feedback I received from my boyfriend after trying their takeout I ordered for him.  For this go-around, I will give a 3.5.. A-OK.  Definitely open to giving them another shot, though.  I met one of my girlfriends here for an early dinner on Monday.  It is such a strange and unexpected location for a restaurant I thought, but I love that type of place filled with locals and regulars.  Luckily, it was a straight shot from my office to the restaurant.  When we got there, we parked across the street and entered through the back(ish) door of the bar.  The entire bar turned and stared at us.  Maybe they aren't used to new faces?  Not sure.  We were told there was seating in the dining room which was large and open with quite a few 4+ seat tables.  There were a few other families there.  Their special of the day was that it was their wing night!  Perfect. I love wings.  We ordered their buffalo chicken fries to start and they were....heavenly.  Not sure why we thought two dozen wings to follow would be a grand idea, but we ordered them anyway - 1 dozen spicy garlic parm, 1/2 doz honey bbq and 1/2 spicy teriyaki.  I asked for them extra crispy.  Unfortunately, I was not a fan of these wings.  The chicken was not very tender and although they were a decent size, they weren't crispy and they seemed to have a lot of gristle on them.  We each ate a few, but the number consumed didn't compare to how many we boxed up and eventually just tossed.   I also noticed that I was charged full price for the wings instead of their special price of $.50...maybe this was because we boxed them up and took them home?  Not a big deal, just something I noticed. So for me personally, the wings were a miss here.  I did take Bobby a salmon Caesar salad with an order of fries with gravy on the side.  He LOVED the homemade croutons and dressing and raved about the fresh fries and gravy.  I have to agree with him - they were excellent.  The place was not very busy, only a few other tables with families that had [screaming] children and our waitress was SO friendly.  She took great care of us and was willing to accommodate all of our requests.  I would definitely give this place another shot, but I think next time I would try something different.  It seems like their sandwiches are what they do best.  Wouldn't mind having a few drinks here either as their bar was pretty nice and a decent size.",

For food, prices, and atmosphere you definitely get five stars. I only have three stars because of one of the waitress/bar tenders. Always overwhelmed (even if there are only two customers), not very attentive AT ALL, and a little on the rude side. After a long wait she brought out my friend's drinks, but not mine. She apologized and said she would return. After an additional ten minutes, I finally approached the bar and had the bar tender get me a beer which I then paid for. I returned to my seat and she now tries to bring me the beer I had long waited and already purchased at the bar. I told her I no longer needed it because I had to go the bar and I already paid for a beer. She kept telling me it was already on my bill and I said no, take it off, I already bought a beer. Finally, after a little back and forth she walked away with it... I was actually shocked. Of course I will be back here, we love this place. But maybe talk to your employee...",

The soup of the day was some sort of beef-something...hard to tell. It was thin broth, that I honestly compared to the broth left in the bottom of a pan when roasting a piece of beef, and then poured into a bowl. ???   The salad was ho-hum boring, nothing great, and was not \"loaded with a mountain of cheese\"..there was barely any on it.   The Italian Hoagie was the kicker, though. It tasted like something I would buy at the grocery store deli case, and went home an microwaved it. It was not crisply baked, as indicated on the menu, and the meat was of low quality, greasy and unappealing. The fries were served almost luke warm.  I mentioned this to the wait staff, and she said, \"oh\", took my uneaten sandwich and put it into a \"to-go\" container, as I told her I would at least give it to my dog.  She had no concern, questions, nothing. Sad.  The atmosphere is lovely, and I only wish that the food lived up to the expectations, of the decor and the fabulous menu.  We have no interest in returning to even see if this was a fluke.",

We live fairly close as we're in West View but to say this restaurant is off the beaten path is an understatement. As soon as we walked in, it reminded us both of our hometowns.  It was 'Seat Yourself,' and despite a pretty full house we got a table right away. After reviewing the drink list, I don't think I saw a single beer over $4.50 which is amazing in its own right.  For dinner, we ordered some wings as an appetizer, the meatloaf special for me, and the French dip for my wife.  After some time our entrees were delivered and the waitress apologized that they came out before the wings. I'm actually thankful as it had to be the biggest plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes I've ever seen. The meatloaf was absolutely delicious and just what I needed on a cold winter night. My wife enjoyed her sandwich and fries as well.  A minor mishap with the wings, and I hope to try them soon as we'll definitely be back.",

It's that perfect mix of bar/dive atmosphere with a slightly more sophisticated menu. We've already visited twice in a week. I think it's safe to say we're going to be regulars!   The atmosphere is what you'd expect. There is a bar and a separate dining room. Everything is very open, making it easy to hear your neighbors conversation, but it's still very comfy and cozy. They have a few TVs and arcade games.   The food is perfect! Pizza, fries and cheeseburgers are all very good, but my favorite was their Cajun steak hoagie. OMG! It was definitely an interesting twist from your typical Philly Cheesesteak. Seasoned with a Cajun spice, the steak with chopped and cooked just right. It practically melted in your mouth. Must try!   The best part about this place is the phenomenal deals and prices. They run great daily specials on both food and drink that you can't pass up. For the quality and price, you can't go wrong. Four beers, two hoagies and fries and a pizza all came between $30-$40.   It's definitely a weird location, but if you're in the area you have to try! For sure a local gem.",

I was happy to find that they have a parking lot across the street.   We decided to sit at the bar and order food. The bar is a nice size and I would guess it's awesome in the summer with all of the windows open. (We'll have to go back once it warms up to find out.)  I thought they offered a nice selection of beer both drafts and bottles. The bartenders were friendly and attentive even though you can tell this is a bar that typically sees regulars.   My husband and I both enjoyed our food. They have the typical bar food; sandwiches, pizza, burgers, wings. Let's be honest, any place that has hot cheese balls on the menu is a winner in my book.   The Thursday special was a \"hog bowl\" and it seemed very popular. Basically 15 wings in a large dog dish.   We'll definitely go back now that we know where it is.",

    "text": "Well, somebody from this place has finitely explained to me why there are differences between the the web site and what they do at the restaurant . It's not really their website. The web site was with 2 or three owners ago. The current owners are trying to get into the web site to change it but haven't been able to. On the web site, specials are for takeout, but they say that specials are only eat in. I think that they honor these 2 or 3 years ago pricings  really shows that they want to show goodwill towards their customers but they can't absorb too much of a loss. If this was made clear to me the last time I questioned them about the discrepancy between the web site and what they did at the restaurant I wouldn't have had a problem, but I was just told,\"It (the web site) didn't say that\", in fact, calling me a liar. Since the new owners have taken over the food has been very good and the wait staff much better and seem happier. This is not gourmet food but it is great bar food. Great fish, burgers and wings.",

They have a special $5 burgers and fries on Wednesdays and the burgers are delicious! The bun is soft and the burger is nice and juicy. They also have awesome drink specials every night of the week, and there are TV's around the bar so it's a great place to watch a game. The bartender we've had is very friendly and welcoming to those who aren't regulars.",

Great beer selection. And the people there are amazing! Kelsey.... With a contagious smile; very helpful and attentive with our group of 11!!! The kids all loved her! Trudy.... Funny funny lady had us laughing and laughing on our first visit.... Jennifer, our bartender on our last night there.... Kelsey's mom, another friendly bartender....

    "text": "A very out of the way hidden gem, Hog's Head (also known as The Pig Place) has traditional bar food with a few tweaks. I didn't get it, but the Big Meatball appetizer sounded real good.  I went there on a Thursday for their Bowl of Wings deal (15 wings for $6 served in a dog bowl). I got there a little after 4:30pm and it was already pretty crowded. I asked if it was ok for me to push some empty tables together as I was expecting 12 total people in my party. The waitress said it was fine. As I waited for the rest of my party to arrive the dining area got really crowded. I had to stop some people from taking some of my chairs. This place gets really full really fast and it seems like the locals run the place (or at least think they do) and give the stink eye to outsiders.  Once my group arrived we all ordered and got our food in pretty decent time for how busy the place was. I got the bowl of Buffalo Ranch wings. A little on the small side but really good Buffalo sauce. My one friend got the Buffalo Chicken fries that were huge and looked really good.  On my way out I left through the bar to catch a glimpse of it and it is very compact, but looks fun.  Hog's Head is a little out of the way and seems like a big hangout for locals, but I would go back to try some of the various bar foods they have.",

    "text": "OK, so I have to say that I wanted to like this place a lot.  Looking for a place to eat one evening I did a quick search what was nearby and came across this.  Scanned the reviews and pictures and thought this would be a great place to stop.  Driving up to the place you get this feeling that you are about to enjoy an authentic hole-in-the-wall experience.  I mean you don't always come upon a bar that was basically a house at one point in time.  I love these types of places.  We walked into the dining area first and thought we'd check out the bar before picking a table.  The bar area was packed, so I deduce that this is quite the hangout spot for your night out.  We ended up deciding to eat in the dining room area.  It's rather dim, two TVs on the wall, and some old school arcade games accompany the tables throughout.  We were able to seat ourselves and picked where we wanted.  We were promptly greeted by our server and had menus in hand and drink orders placed.  We looked over the menu and by the time our drinks came back we were ready to order.  I had the Fish on the Plate and my other half chose the blue burger.  We also took advantage of the drink special that night, which was killer for a Saturday in the city.  Actually, whatever night you are here, take advantage of either or both of the specials, one is for food and the other is for drinks.  Saturdays you get a large cheese pizza for like seven bucks.  Our food arrives and I have to say these are monstrous servings.  My order came with two sides, since I was already going fried I chose French fries and onion rings as my side.  I also got some tartar sauce for my huge ass piece of fish.  What I did not know is that this came with Cole slaw as well, I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of their style, but not everyone is going to like every type of slaw out there.  My other half got fries with his burger.  I honestly could not eat all this food and did not want to take it home with me, reheating fish is not the best idea if you ask me.  My other half wasn't quite as happy with his meal.  After some prying he informed me that it was over salted for him.  For the burger I suppose the mixture of blue cheese and bacon and there being no type of sauce to calm that down made it a bit much.  As for the fries, they were overly salted.  I didn't believe him until I tried one myself.  I only ate half of a fry and was in dire need of some water.  We kind of brushed that off thinking that maybe it was an oversight and just kind of happened.  But when we got our check, we figured out what went on.    When you get a burger or sandwich it naturally comes with fries.  You can change that for a fee to onion rings or sweet potato fries I think.  So when the server asked if fries were fine, he said yes.  But on the check she had put it in as 'loaded fries.'  Normally when you see 'loaded fries' that means covered in cheese and maybe bacon.  But here I guess that means thickly coated in salt.  He couldn't even eat them and I can attest to that.  He didn't want to make a fuss, so I didn't make a fuss.  It was his meal and it appeared he wasn't very hungry to begin with.  So I guess for him, this worked out well.  Parking is a bit tricky here, I almost drove past the place at first and then realized that there is a parking lot across the street.  Ample spots available.",

They use fresh meat and the buns are so tremendously soft with perfectly browned tops and their mushroom swiss concoction is what \"mushroom swiss burger nirvana\" is really all about.  It's all I seem to order here because it's that good.   Tonight, however, we were hungry for more.  We ordered up some well done garlic parmesan wings with a side of celery and ranch and sipped on our cold beers until they arrived.  Those wings were amazing.  The fresh minced garlic and butter coated the super crispy wings and left a delicious pool of garlicky butter at the bottom of the basket that we scooped up and slathered onto our freshly cut French fries.  Oh my gosh, unbelievably good.    Their beer and drink prices are so reasonable too.  Service was very good again.  It's usually the same two women waiting tables and they are both always very warm and efficient.   We love this place so much but wonder how long before we have to wait for a table.  This is a real hidden gem that's only minutes from the Parkway North Hazlett Street exit.    It's worth a visit or great for take out.",

The very first thing we saw upon pulling into the parking lot was one of the storied locals peeing on the front of the building, at the bottom of the bar stairs.   Nonetheless, we persevered into the dining room and had a very nice time. Our waitress was very nice and, for the most part, quite attentive. The nachos grande were pretty good (despite the cheese sauce instead of melted cheese).  The black n blue shrimp app was awesome!  Very few local beers, for some reason, but that's neither here nor there. Their beer list is not up to date either but, again, no biggie.   The problem arose when our 3 burgers, ordered medium rare, arrived very well done. The waitress even took my half-eaten burger back to the kitchen to show the cook. It was too late to wait for another order. But did they offer to comp all or part of our burgers, or even throw us a beer or two?  Nope. Full price, no apologies.  Too bad, as the toppings on the burgers would have made for a great meal if cooked to order. We'll be back to Pittsburgh, often, but never back to this place.",

Literally waited 20 minutes for a salad and appetizers to come to the table. All told it took over an hour to get our meals!!?!? The food is great, so I'd only recommend it if you don't mind the wait.",

When we got inside we were in the dinning area for 20 minutes when I went to the bar to tell them we were waiting to order. The bar maid said she would be right with us, We waited another 15 minutes before she came to take our order. In the mean time she never came back to check and see if we needed and more to drink. After another 30 minutes and no food came yet and we were the only ones in the dinning area so we left. I quess the people at the bar were more important than people waiting for their food. Will never go back again. Terrible service.",

    "text": "I went there initially awhile ago for the wing special which was pretty cool. They serve 15 wings in a Hog's bowl or dog dish sort of thing. I thought it was neat and different. The fries with cheese and gravy are awesome. The wings were ok. The garlic parm were kinda bland but the regular buffalo mild were tasty. I've tried a few things here and everything wasn't bad at all. I would like to try a few more. Overall Hog's Head isn't bad. Depending on when you go there you can't hear over the loud drunks screaming across the bar to each other. But beware. The False advertising of the special on yelp. They tell you that they can't do it or no one there knows how to do it. So don't go in expecting to be able to use the offer they have on here.",

In a neighborhood so definitely use your GPS or you'll miss it! There was a hockey game on that night so the place was packed. Super casual but I liked the effort they put into their menu. Much better than the traditional bar food. We had burgers but they were great. Tons of different options and probably the best sweet potato fries I've ever had!   I saw a ton of people ordering and raving about their wings but we were too stuffed to try that. There are a ton of TV's even in the dining area so you won't miss a thing if you go during Hockey or football season!",

    "text": "At first google map glance, I was hesitant about its location...upon arriving there is a large gravel parking lot across the street, plenty of parking on a Sunday.  When I entered the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice open space with lots of tables and most importantly a clean space.  The restaurant area and adjoining restrooms were clean and well maintained. Most of the place is beautiful dark wood.  Up a few stairs was a large bar with around 20 seats and another set of restrooms upstairs (which I did not use).  I came to Hog's Head for a Baby Shower so our food was preselected and displayed buffet style. Our choices were chicken fingers, salad, hoagies, and Vodka Aurora.  The Vodka Aurora was great, so good I took a container home.  The salad, chicken fingers and hoagies were all good quality \"bar food\".  The wait staff was pleasant and kept our tables clean.  There was no smoking, the restaurant is kid-friendly, but there's a nice adults only bar area, and it's a very casual setting (jeans and a t-shirt).  If I lived closer this would be an easy \"go grab some food and a beer\" kind of place for me.",
