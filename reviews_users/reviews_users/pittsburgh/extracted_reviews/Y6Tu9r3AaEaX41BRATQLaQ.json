It was all tasty, but I think their cooks' specialties must be the vegetarian stuff.  There were also several Indians there for lunch - always a good sign when an ethnic restaurant attracts its respective community.  (Double points if they're recent immigrants who weren't raised on Burger King and Red Lobster like me and all of my friends.)",

I am not much of a reviewer but I thought people should benefit from my review and eat here at least once to know how good it is. The naan is out of this world and chicken tikka masala is great. The service is great too - just the seating and interiors, I'm not really fond of but that's fine I guess. With so little good Indian food options in Pittsburgh, this is a must go place!",

We recently came here for a team dinner and were pleasantly surprised with the variety and quality of the food.  The chicken tikka masala is delicious and the vegetarian dishes are just as good.  Of course, the non-stop bollywood videos captivated our attention for hours.  The only reason this restaurant didn't get a higher rating is because of the lack of service.  There were only 3-4 parties in the entire restaurant and yet we waiting for a long time to get our food.  Service was slow and we had to ask several times just to make sure our order was not forgotten.  Nevertheless, I would definitely come back since the food was yummy and priced right.",

Buffet Line - crammed in a corner for everyone to use.  We noticed that some items were in the corner with the bread server pushed up against it. It was tough to navigate.   Dining Room - could use a few less tables to give more room so one can pass by tables without turning sideways.   Dining Room decor - needs an update!  The drapes were heavy and discolored (faded from the sun, since the sunlight blares through the dining room). I think it was more maroon in color -- really dark and would be great in brighter cleaner colors.   Windows and window sill could use some cleaning. Our table was pushed up against the window and we were crammed into a tight spot.  I think my seat bench had busted springs because the table top was almost to the bottom of my chin.   This place has a banquet room going through a separate door.   Prices  - inexpensive.",

There are plenty of curries to choose from, and unlike many Indian lunch buffets, they often have \"premium\" curries such as Palak Paneer or Malai Kofta. In addition, there are plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits with the buffet, which really helps round out the meal and keep it from being so heavy. I've also been here a couple of times when they've had Southern Indian selections such as Masala Dosa, which is another nice perk.  The only thing I don't understand is the condition of the restrooms. They are beyond decayed and the floors are scary. I hope the owners of the restaurant read this and consider a thorough cleaning of the restrooms. It would really help raise customers' perceptions of the restaurant.",

While the decor is a bit overwhelming with the draperies and all the deep red color, the buffet offers quite a bit of selection for an empty stomach. The offering is hot and tasty, and I tried everything from the buffet including the dessert. The garlic naan that we ordered was fresh too, full of garlicky goodness and herbs with some crisp on the edges. Service was okay and when we decided to leave we just went up to the host to pay (not sure if that was proper protocol). We went around 1pm and not crowded at all so go late!

The sauce had the  combination of sweet and spicy and the chicken was cooked very well. They also had a delicious array of sauces made to top the fluffy breads that they offer. However, the food lost some of its rich flavor as I started looking more around the room. With the hand prints covering the door and mirror near the entrance, 'stuff' on the floor, and a bus pan of dirty dishes near the buffet area, I can't bring myself to consider this place clean. Unfortunately, the lack of cleanliness isn't this restaurant's only turn off. The staff also needed some work. Rather than being welcomed to the restaurant, I felt as if I were intruding on a private party. The wait staff were very short with me and showed me that they wanted to spend the least amount of time possible talking with me. I can't say that I will ever return to India Garden due to all of this.",

Lots of vegetarian items on the buffet; all of which that I tried were tasty and extremely worthy of a full second round trip to the buffet. They had naan (plain and garlic) and puri, which were better than their rice, which seemed a little old (some hard and extra chewy grains in there). The food was not very warm. Not spicy either (keep in mind, I am a spice whore), but they have some really interesting homemade hot sauce, unlike any I've ever had before. Their pickle mix is also unique, positively. Dishes didn't seem as greasy as some other places with Northern style cuisine. I ate a ton and did not regret it. I will definitely look forward to returning when I can resist the wonders of Udipi (obviously, if I lived nearer, I'd frequent both)!",

The lamb curry was full of it, my chicken sausage things had cilantro cooked into it as an ingredient, and cilantro was liberally sprinkled over the top of my entire meal platter. Even the nan was prepared with cilantro baked into it, with more cilantro sprinkled on top. Ugh. Wish I had had some kind of warning, but I don't think I saw the word \"cilantro\" a single time on the menu.  Also, according to the menu, the meal I ordered included a cup of masala chai, but it wasn't brought out to me. When I asked the waiter about it near the end of my meal, he said that I was mistaken, and that the meal didn't come with the chai. I looked incredulously at him, about to ask him to bring out the menu again so that I could re-read the item description because the inclusion of the chai was one of my deciding factors, but he suddenly backpedaled and said he would go double-check, but he didn't think my meal was supposed to come with a beverage. He came back a minute later with the chai and silently set it beside me without any explanation or apology.  If you love cilantro and get better service than I did, you might classify this place as 3 or 4 stars, but my experience was no more than 2/5.",

The buffet is a tad bit smaller than most however.    The server was very attentive with always making surenour drinks were full and that we had hot fresh naan.    The food itself was great. A tad bit milder than what I have grown accustomed to,  but one must allow for all palates.    Would definitely go back again.",

It is located in an old strip mall next to some kind of strange Halloween oriented indoor miniature golf establishment.    I went for lunch buffet and loved it. I just recently started eating Indian whenever I can (since a trip to India) so I ate lots of chicken dishes. Tikka Masala, chicken curry, chili chicken, tandoori chicken & naan was all very good.  The Naan was a little crunchy and could have been more fresh, but they did have plain, garlic and cheese naan on the buffet which I don't see often.   The dining room is nice and much more reasonable than the exterior (see interior pics).  I will eat here again when I am in Monroeville in the future. I suggest you do the same.",

I'm not sure why people are saying there's a small selection, there's always at least three appetizers, ten entrees, two types of naan, a salad bar, and at least four desserts. The only entree that is remotely sweet is the korma. Yes, the decor is dated, but my primary concern is the food. The service is very good too, they're not the most talkative staff but they're good about filling your water and taking your dirty plates away.",

Normally, I take the Anthony Bordain approach to Buffet which is avoid it at all cost as if plagued. BUT NOT HERE! The buffet here is prepared fresh, each and every time.  Indian buffets are popular in pittsburgh. However, a tasty addition found on their indian buffets is almost always an interesting goat dish. Their naan is amazing- crispy, rich, and delicate. I eat too much every time! I believe they are especially skilled in Tandori, Kofta, and Masala.   Please do not let the outdated exterior and location sway you- their food is amazing and their service is excellent each and every time.

If u are Indian and reading this, by all means, this is the place for you! We had to wait and wait and remind them of what we ordered multiple times. We actually come here 5-6 times a year for the last 4 years, mainly because the actual food is really good. We spend an average of $60-$80 plus tip w/ our kids each time, not a cheap night out. I only gave a 10% tip last night, and I never do that.  The younger guy working there saved this rating because he actually seemed to care about us and went out his way to refill our drinks and ask if we needed anything, and he wasn't even our waiter. I'd say still go here, but not if you're in a rush.  The chicken tikka masala is pretty damn good  and the combo plates are awesome, but they always seem to forget to give you the tea that's supposed to come with it at the end. You have to ask for it.",

    "text": "This garden of goodness never fails me. We ordered take out on a Sunday afternoon and it was just as delicious as sitting in the restaurant. I have to say that that is probably the best thing about this place to me: the food tastes just as good whether you eat in or take out. A lot of restaurants aren't consistent with their foods and I really appreciate the fact that India Garden is. They always ask how spicy you want your food...\"0-10\" . I always receive my meal accurately prepared, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. A few times they even gave me extra garlic naan (brownie points)!!   While eating in, I find that our food is always brought to us in a timely manner and drinks are refilled graciously. If you really can't decide and are here during the lunch hour, you can't go wrong with the lunch buffet.  Now that I am writing the review, I can't even think of something that I would improve about IG if I could. Maybe it would be a bit of updating the building? However I like the \"old feel\" and think it adds character.  A must-try is the shrimp saag (I can't stray), and the Taj Mahal beer they sell has been requested by my brother in law for years, since he can't find it anywhere in Philly. I honestly carry it out in boxes for him- it's that fabulous. Quality Indian cuisine doesn't get much better than this!",

We ordered manchurian for a starter , which was served quickly with a divine look , but the taste is devastating which stabbed out our appetite . We also ordered egg biryani  & a thali in which  biryani looked delectable but didn't taste anything like biryani or fried rice atleast  Thali is even worse as the curries are sweet even though the spice level we ordered is more , the parata they served   with the thali is very hard ,soggy n un chewable. The only thing you can probably like is the experience which is  freaking  expensive (40$ + tips)  Overall : May be they concentrated more only on plate decoration rather than taste of food  Don't fall for the pictures as your eyes deceive you",

Until a guy came over yelling at her in indian about how to hold a glass. I guess she was being trained.  I felt so bad for her. He then took over our table and was rude. I seen her in the bathroom and handed her a five as a tip. Cause i didn't feel the man deserved it.",

It was some of the worse service I have ever had.  We had to ask for menus, there were very infrequent visits by the server to check on us and it took almost an hour before our food arrived.  We were going to order dessert, but we worried we would be there another hour if we did.  It then took another 20 or so minutes for the bill.  The only redeeming factor is that the food was very tasty. I  The second trip (because of an expiring certificate) was totally different.  Service was so efficient it was almost too much.  And it didn't even need to be because we ordered the buffet (which is offered for lunch and Tuesday evenings).    The three stars is because of the inconsistent experience.  I wish I knew that the service would always be as good as it was on our second visit, but since there is no guarantee it won't take us two plus hours next time we visit, I think I'll be sticking to other area restaurants instead.",

The goat dish was a paltry 2 pieces of actual goat; instead there were many pieces of sharp bones mixed in the rice. The dessert section had only two items--this sugary mound of gloop and pieces of watery honeydew. Thankfully, this was a company event so I did not have to pay, because the value and variety of the food is not up to par with a normal buffet.",

Anyhow they offer a lunch buffet from 11-3, I believe, daily.  Typically I despise buffets but since I am a novice to Indian food I thought this would be an opportunity to try different things.    First time up, I did just that.  A small scoop of this, some of that.  I really don't know everything that I ate.  There were some signs, but unless you are familiar with the cuisine it might as well be written in Hindi.  There were a few recognizable things, Chicken Curry, Chilly Chicken, and Chicken in Teriyaki sauce.  The rest would be words that made absolutely no sense to me, but I am adventurous so I tried most of what I saw.    All in all, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't something that rocked my core and made me want to rush back, but there was some good flavor in some of the dishes and a nice spice level.  I would say charging $10.00 for a lunch buffet seems steep to me.  I think it should be more in line with the 7-8 dollar range, and lastly I felt the dining area could use a good cleaning.  There were crumbs on the seats and the table cloths were all stained.  Not too appealing.",

The lamb curry and basmati rice were seasoned to perfection and I highly recommend this dish. I had some leftovers and it was delicious the following day as well. The garlic naan was outstanding.

Sometimes they take way too much time to refill the curries during buffet. If it was only for buffet, I'd probably rate them 2. However, if you're ordering things from the menu, for instance lamb curry or chicken karahi, they do a far better job. But then if you go too fancy and try something fancy from their menu, the food comes out as a mixture of few curries rather than the original. So in summary, if you're Indian, you know what the staple is and stick to it. If you're not, stick to chicken karahi, lamb curry, vindaloo, and chicken biryani.",

I wish that photo of the dead fly, on the side of the plate would get taken down. It is very unappealing and really, it could've noted on their comment instead of taking a disgusting picture and posting it on here.",
