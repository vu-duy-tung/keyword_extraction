Their fish is cut properly, and most importantly is fresh. No, it's not as good as Penn Ave Fish Company, but it's much better than several other Pittsburgh sushi experiences I could name. The price is right too - I recently got 2 salmon handrails to go for less than $11. Everyone there is very friendly, and there is always a table available, even when you walk in. They are willing to make modifications within reason too. I absolutely love pickled ginger, and they were happy to send me on my way with extra. Overall, a great experience, and a consistent positive experience.",

I ordered (take-out) the Aloha Roll, the Naruto Roll, and the Alaska Roll and all three were delish! The host was especially helpful as I chose which rolls to order; he asked what I liked/didn't like and made recommendations based off of my input. They have a large selection of sushi to choose from as well which I really liked. The prices for the rolls are pretty comparable to other sushi restaurants, and ranged from ~$5 to ~$17 depending on the ingredients included in the roll. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I each ordered a hibachi dinner meal, and wow, what a deal! We each asked for miso soup, instead of the clear soup that is included, at no extra cost. The miso was VERY strong/thick, but tasty. Our meals also included a small salad, which my boyfriend got with the original gingery dressing, but I omitted, since it contains dairy. The waitress kindly brought over some oil instead. The main courses were HUGE, and my vegetable hibachi was very delicious. You have your choice of fried rice or white, so I ordered fried without egg. I was stuffed, and still took some veggies home, AND my meal cost only 10 bucks (my boyfriend's steak hibachi was 15).  The atmosphere, service, and quality of food all receive A's from me. From now on, I will be coming here instead of Nakama for hibachi. And thank you for being so vegan-aware, and able to accommodate!  ***EDIT: I had to change from five stars to three, due to my recent return visit:  I had the same waitress as last time, but this time she checked with the chef about the hibachi to make sure it was vegan. She returned with sad news: the veggies are prepared with a pork base! Apparently, the only vegan entree option is to order the mango chicken with tofu instead. It was very tasty, but a bit pricey and not nearly as awesome as the hibachi. I still appreciate that the waitress took my vegan concerns into consideration, but I hope Ginza expands their menu to include more vegan-friendly options so that I may go back!",

The service is great, and the place is clean and altogether not bad-looking on the inside. I've gone here for lunch to catch up with friends and we didn't feel pressured to leave the second we were finished our meal or anything, which was very nice. I do wish some of the entrees were less bland, but you can't have everything. Perhaps it's because I prefer a little bit more spice, but the hibachi chicken and salmon dishes I've tried were rather underwhelming. The fish used in the sashimi and sushi seems fresh for the most part though, and since it's raw that's far more important to me!",

Tons of fish in there. Everything seems pretty fresh to us, which is probably the most important factor with sushi. It was all pretty good, however, a lot of the menu includes tempura including the Spicy Yellowtail and Ginza roll. I have to say I'm not a big fan of that. If I want tempura, I'll get tempura separately. Otherwise the food was decent if not particularly inspired.  A couple of items to note:  This is a BYOB establishment, so plan accordingly (we didn't unfortunately). Interestingly, their spicy was not particularly spicy. I'm used to more spice than this, which was a little disappointing.   Overall this was a pretty good deal for sushi, so if money is a major factor, this is certainly a place to consider. However, I think there are other better places for sushi in the city.",

The sushi itself was excellent, The preparation wasn't quite as extravagant as some other people have experienced here, but I don't grade on flair, I grade on quality. The service wasn't nearly as bad as some reviews would have you think; it was on par with any other restaurant and we were treated well throughout.   I'll admit I was a little worried when I initially went in because it seemed a little TOO quiet, but then business started to pick up as the night went on.   We got the Ginza Roll, a Tuna Roll or some such, and a Sweet Potato Roll.   If you don't get the Sweet Potato roll, you are wrong. I am unabashedly judging you from the internet if you don't partake of the Ginza sweet potato roll. I don't care if you don't like sweet potato. It doesn't matter. Broaden your horizons and get one because it will blow your mind.   And then, the price! I don't know how they do it, but then again, who cares? I walked out of there for only like $32, and that would have been easily twice that any most other sushi places for the amount of food that we got at that level of quality.",

I was skeptical when I saw the menu prices, thinking \"What's the catch?\"But, Ginza is the real deal, good sushi at an even better price.  I've gone for both lunch and dinner, and this place has some of the best sushi deals in town. For dinner, I recommend going with a friend and getting Marki for Two. At $37, the dinner is such a bargain for two, with 4 rolls and 2 soups or salads. My jaw nearly dropped to the floor when I realized how much food we were snagging.   The weekly lunch special is also a deal. You can get 2 or 3 rolls, with a soup or salad, for under $20. With these prices, you'd expect to be eating Giant Eagle sushi, but it's certainly several levels above that. The fish is fresh, and while the standard rolls can be a little \"blah\", the specialty rolls are fantastic. I lean towards spicy or crunchy rolls, and was satisfied with my choices. The spicy isn't too spicy, and the crunchy isn't overwhelming.  Ginza is also BYOB, making it a great casual dinner date spot. Considering the place is almost always empty, it'd probably make a great spot for a group dinner as well.   Judging by the proximity of Ginza to my front door, I know I will be back. There are certainly better sushi places in the city, but Ginza is close, affordable, and will always do the trick.",

But the dressing - for real.   Miso soup. Pretty good. Opaque in color, and keeps you wondering what else is in there. I think for this reason it seems a little more substantial since it's not completely clear.   I've had the Ginza roll, which is freaking huge, and I also had to resist calling it the Yinza roll. I think it's about 12 pieces. It's got tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and Kani for the meats and among other things some delicious spicy mayo.   Besides sushi, they also have a nice selection of other rice, noodle, and hibachi dishes.   It is BYOB and I hit myself on the forehead every time I forget this before going.

    "text": "This is a cute little restaurant in a kinda hipster neighborhood near the city. Parking was a bit of a challenge and it's to be expected in these parts but after 3 laps around the block, we found a space.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly lady at the desk and seated in a location that was away from the door which was very thoughtful on her part.   The place was pretty empty with only one other table occupied by a gentleman reading a newspaper and eating sushi. This concerned me but I do trust my Yelp buddies as you guys have yet to let me down. After gazing over the menu a few times, I opted for sushi and my fellow diner chose the pan fried chicken udon.  It's kinda cool that this is really a hibachi spot without the popular shows...like Benihana or the other spot I will never mention (ahhh Ichiban choooo). Ichiban in the Waterworks/Fox Chapel area is horrible...can you tell I'm still mad at them? Sorry, not sorry.  Okay, back to Ginza...  The noodles came with a side of soup or salad. My fellow diner didn't care for their miso. It was originally thought the soup option would be the regular clear broth so the waiter happily offered to replace it. A few minutes later, however, the waiter returned with a salad. I wasn't sure how the waiter missed this with an empty restaurant. Although the salad dressing tasted more like thousand island with a bunch of mayo added, we decided not to complain because he was so very nice and hey...it's just salad anyway. Shortly after that, our selections arrived. The sushi was pretty good and the price was fair in my opinion. Tempura shrimp were cooked well and the fish tasted fresh. The udon was just okay but the chicken had that nice rich grilled taste.   While I probably wouldn't return here for a salad, soup or entree, I definately would come back for more sushi! (3 stars for sushi!)",

Of course, one of the best places I found was right in my backyard, this is probably the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Which is always why I'm confused when I visit and the place is empty? Maybe I always catch odd hours? Maybe people do take out? Not sure, either way, I don't mind the chill environment. We regularly get the Maki for 2 which comes with soup or salad, we almost always end up taking about a full roll home, the servings are generous! The miso soup is super delicious and piping hot when it hits your table. The service for the sushi is always speedy and beautiful, we haven't had a roll that we disliked. The fish tastes clean and fresh while the tempura rolls are crispy and light. Definitely recommend this little spot!",

    "text": "I love Ginza, its my go to sushi place in Pittsburgh. I think its the best sushi deal for the quality and quantity you get. The fish is good and fresh, granted its no Umi so don't expect that, but its a step up for sure from some comparable priced places (Sushi Too comes to mind, but I still order from there because they deliver). For the best deals on fresh fish, the sashimi appetizer is 10 pieces for $9. They also have a dinner for 2 special which is $40, comes with 2 soups or salads and you get to pick 2 special rolls (which are $11-15 each) and 2 regular rolls (also $6 each). If you do the math, its a great deal and you feel like a king when that much sushi is brought out to you. Generally, I ask for less sauce on my special rolls, I don't particularly like masking the fish flavor. Their tempura is also great, nice and crispy, and the appetizer is sizable.  Its BYOB if you are dining in, and the bulk of their business is takeout so there's never a wait for a table. Outdoor seating is available when the weather is nice, but Liberty Ave isn't the most pleasant view. If you're ordering takeout, give it 25-30 minutes for your order to be ready, sometimes 45 minutes if its peak takeout time. I do really wish they would deliver, I'd order more often!",

    "text": "I recall watching the documentary film \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" (highly recommend for anyone wanting to learn a little more about sushi or about sushi master Jiro Ono himself) on Netflix a couple weeks ago and immediately realized that it had been months since I had some sushi.  The next day I purchased a LivingSocial deal for Ginza, and then the day after that my husband and I made dinner reservations and redeemed the deal.  The atmosphere was very relaxed, unpretentious.  Service was efficient and personable on a busy Friday evening, just the right mix of casual and professional.  There was a steady influx of new dine-in customers during the nearly 2 hours we spent at Ginza, a relatively small establishment, as well as a number of take-out customers who came and went.  The reason for our lengthy dinner was a large party that received all its orders ahead of us.  The server and manager handled the situation well though, apologizing for the busy sushi bar and bringing over a complimentarily heap of edamame to help pass the time.  Really loved the Ginza Roll and would order it again in a heartbeat.  Tuna Mountain was also very good, but next time--and there will be a next time--I think I'll pass on it in favor of a Rainbow Roll or a Dancing Eel.  I'm a big fan of eel rolls, and to be honest my terrific but eel-less dinner at Ginza still left me craving some eel.  The 2 simple rolls we chose as part of our \"Marki for Two\" order, a Yellowtail Roll and Boston Roll, were so-so; really simple rolls rarely wow me.  Western Pennsylvania obviously isn't exactly a sushi hot spot, but Ginza was satisfying indeed.  We were very pleased with our meal and the service here.",

It was after 2 pm, awkward for lunch but early for dinner so lots of places aren't open, but Ginza was.  When we walked in, there was literally one other person eating, which made us a wee bit nervous, wondering about the sushi \"turnover\" and whether the fish was super fresh.  I need not have been concerned.  It was amazing.  We received attentive but not hovering service and our meals were delightful.  My daughter had two rolls which were delicious.  One in particular called a Handsome Boy Roll, and it was one of the best rolls either of us had ever had.  I had a tuna roll and many pieces of nigiri, including yellowtail belly and salmon belly, which aren't available on many sushi menus in the city.  I will definitely make it a point to eat here as often as possible.  I wish it had been more crowded just because it's that great, but hopefully it is more so at actual lunch and dinner times.  Additionally, there is one step up into the restaurant from the sidewalk.  I mention this because my daughter is on crutches although she's quite good at them by now.  The hostess appeared almost instantly at the door and asked if we needed assistance (we didn't) but that's when we saw a buzzer by the door that a person can ring if they need help getting into the restaurant.  That's the first one we've seen in the city and we go lots of places.  A very nice touch.",

My husband and I try to eat here at least once a month, and surprisingly it has also become one of his favorite restaurants of Pittsburgh.   Ginza is perfect for our Friday date night. The atmosphere is relaxed yet romantic, and the price is definitely right. It's BYOB. We are always shocked by how few people know about this little treasure. We have never had to wait to find a seat on a Friday evening.   My husband is not a sushi or sashimi fan, but I am. We both seem to find an entree that suites us. My husband is very much a \"meat and potato\" kind of guy, so what a God sent it was for him to actually ENJOY food at a nice Japanese restaurant. My favorite sushi treat is the Lobster Tempura roll. My husband consistently orders the Shrimp Hibachi. We are both obsessed with the Yum Yum sauce that comes with it. We share the red bean mochi and green tea mochi for dessert, and the consistency of the shell is always perfect.    Only one con: parking is difficult in the area. You may need to circle around some side streets to find some on-street parking.  I highly recommend Ginza, and we hope more people will discover this wonderful restaurant gem of Pittsburgh!",

I ordered the miso and it was warm (not hot) and was nothing to write home about. When our sushi came out, it looked nice on the plate, but was nothing above and beyond. Regular, not so interesting or tasty, but okay. (Rolls were Spicy Salmon, Cucumber and Eel, and Avocado and Tuna). Next came the Beef Teriyaki. It arrived on the plate with some shredded carrot and rice, and the meat sat on top of cooked green pepper, celery and onion. It arrived slightly warm and without much taste.

I finally dragged the husband there late one night when we didn't feel like driving somewhere.  He had the hibachi chicken, which came with big piles of rice and veggies as well as chicken.  I had a tuna roll, salmon sashimi, special white tuna sushi and unagi sushi.  Other than the weird presentation of the sashimi (wrapped around cucumber like you'd get in a cucumber roll) - everything tasted good and was quite fresh.  I actually wanted more of the special white tuna, but restrained myself.",

While the service was good we called to ask if there was a bar before arrival and were told this place was BYOB,    We brought a mini cooler with some beer.  There was no corking or bottle opening required on their part and no corking fee advertised on the menu.  We simply asked for two empty glasses, opened our own beer, poured it ourselves and were charged a $3 corking fee PER PERSON for requesting empty glasses.    If we had brought a bottle of wine, they opened it, brought a bucket of ice or gave some sort of \"corking\" service, this would have been completely acceptable.  BYOB and requesting empty glasses is not a \"corking\" service and we could have went somewhere within the same block and ordered the beer for $3 per person.  Go to Nikki's Thai Kitchen or somewhere else, this place is not worth the time.  One positive note, the dishes were very well presented.",

Pretty much your standard sweet & sour chicken with chunks of fresh pineapple which was a nice touch, but tasted phenomenal. Came with a side of fried rice and miso soup and salad. Soup was OK, could have had a little more kick and the salad was not the best because the lettuce was really watery. However, the main portion was an A+. Can't wait to go back.",

The sushi itself, though, was tiny.  Each piece was about half the size that you would get at a better sushi restaurant like Andys, Chaya, or Sushi Too.  For the same price I could've gotten twice the amount at a little better quality.  The fish wasn't too great and two of the pieces were very chewy and kinda gross.  I like cheap sushi, but this isn't cheap enough to justify its poor taste.   I give it 2 stars due to the size of the rolls and the amount of food I got for 17 dollars.  I'm not too picky about my sushi, but really I'd rather spend the same somewhere better or less at a real cheap place like Sushi Boat in oakland.",

I wanted to try this place given its good reviews, but was let down. I ordered the 3 roll lunch special (california roll, tuna roll, salmon avocado roll) which comes with a soup or salad, and also ordered an age-tofu as an appetizer. My overall bill came to around $17-18.  I order age tofu at every \"Japanese\" restaurant I go to because it is a litmus test that reveals whether the restaurant knows its craft. The age-tofu today revealed to me the unfortunate truth: that Ginza is not worth the hype and that they don't really know what real age-tofu is. The age-tofu that I received looked like deep fried pieces of medium-firm tofu (real age-tofu is made with extra silken tofu), served with a spring roll dipping sauce. Real age-tofu is served with a shoyu sauce, drizzled over the tofu thus masking the fried texture.  The rolls from my lunch special - california, tuna, and salmon/avocado - were decent. Better than supermarket sushi, but really nothing to praise. The rolls here are at about the same level of craft as the ones at Oishi Bento in Oakland.",

I decided to wait at one of their outdoor tables. After 20 minutes, I returned inside to ask if my food was done. It was not and the front desk staff explained that it was very busy and the kitchen was backed up. When all was said and done--it took about 60 minutes for my order to be ready.   That was a bad start. When I got home, I found the sushi to be fresh and tasty so that did redeem Ginza in my eyes. I enjoyed all three of the rolls I had ordered.

I ordered two salmon ngiri sushi, spicy salmon roll, dragon roll, and gyoza. I grabbed my order and checked it out in the car. It looked so delicious and it definitely was when I finally got to try it. I was really satisfied with the size and freshness of my ngiri salmon and the spicy but not deathly spicy salmon roll. It was on the smaller side and perfect. The gyoza came with six pieces and a good size container of soy sauce. Everything had soy sauce on the side and I like this because some places give you one small container for your entire order. Not here! My dragon roll was different than what I'm used to seeing and tasting from a dragon roll, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. Each piece was covered with avocado slices and fresh all around.

We had the Red Tiger Roll, which is one side shrimp and one side spicy salmon, a smaller spicy salmon roll (with crunchy), a smaller spider roll with lightly battered soft shell crab, and Cheese Chikuwa roll with baked cheese filled fish cakes in soy wrappers. Everything was very good. They have daily specials and it is BYOB so you can bring a nice bottle of wine. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's \"little Italy\" so this was a surprise find but it is a gem.",

It was pretty crowded when we walked in, but we were greeted right away and sat down. We didn't have much time so we glanced the menu quickly and ordered! I ordered the beef noodle soup and my girlfriend got Sushi. The broth was really tasty and all of the mixed veggies were delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the beef itself. It was a bit dry. Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere and would definitely go back and try something else as their menu is huge!",

Now, it was late on a Thursday, so it was empty, which may explain the speedy service but not the fantastic sushi. That was all Ginza. They have quite a few options and we ordered way too much, but it was so, so good. We started with salad and the ginger dressing was not what I remembered but was very good. It seemed thicker than last time I had it, but it was great none the less. The BF and I went with the Maki for two which lets you pick rolls and soup/salad for each. We also got two for the table to split as an appetizer. I can't remember all the ones we ordered but I know we got one called a handsome boy and one called Godzilla. I was astounded when they brought it out. It was a large platter filled with sushi and for $37 you cannot beat it. I cannot tell you what was in any of them, but they were all fantastic. Our neighbor got a platter, but I have no idea what was on his. We all shared and I got lost what was on each platter. As a side note, and this is going to sound strange, but their water was the best water I have had in a restaurant in forever. I even said so, which made the table regard me as an idiot, but after a sip Todd was shocked at how good it was. It was so crisp and refreshing! Try it; you won't be disappointed.",

They are open later for dinner until 11pm on weekends and we went around 10.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  We started with the seaweed salad and tuna tartare and both were excellent.  Then we split the sashimi deluxe and 3 of the rolls.  The sashimi was very fresh and included some more rare options, such as sea bass and fluke.  We were also impressed with all of the rolls, which had generous pieces of fish. We had the samurai roll which was topped with scorched scallops, the dragon roll and a spicy yellowtail roll.  The prices were also very reasonable.  It's hard to find good quality affordable sushi in Pittsburgh, so that is why this is getting 5 stars.",

My boyfriend and I went for the Maki for two, which was the perfect amount for us--Two special rolls and two regular rolls. Let's us each pick our favorites and have some to share! We went for the Strongman roll, Rainbow roll, spicy salmon and California roll. That menu selection also comes with two soups or salads. With two miso soups, an additional seaweed salad and the 4 rolls, we were very satisfied and full after our meal! Can't wait to go back for more.",

The truth is Ginza is cheaper and the rolls are larger. That's just it. Go big or go home.  So if you're craving good sushi at a great price with massive servings, this is your place! I really like that you can put together your own combinations with money saving prices. Between the two of us we split the Marki for Two for $33. It was two specialty rolls and two regular rolls. What a steal!  We ordered the Tuna Lover and Spicy Girl specialty rolls plus the tuna avocado and philly roll. On top of the rolls you also get soup and salad. I mean, geez. Keep piling on the food... and this was just for lunch! All the rolls were really fantastic, with the Tuna Lover being my favorite.   I can tell this is going to fit into the regular rotation of restaurants I'll frequent. I can't wait to come back and try the habachi meals too. Seriously, I could spend months ordering all the different menu options. Maybe I should just set up shop here for the winter. Not too bad for winter hibernation mode.",

Not only is the sushi fresh, but the other entrees have generous portions and taste delicious.  The staff here is fantastic and they are always helpful and pleasant.  Many people choose take-out from here and the take out is always timely and packed well for travel.  My hubby and I often order the Maki for Two, which gives you two (2) special rolls and two (2) regular rolls, plus soup or salad for each of us.  The Fried Rice dishes are always a hit as well as any of the Noodle dishes (which my hubby usually gets as the soup option).  One great thing about the Noodle dishes are that they will customize your heat level.  Hubby loves spicy foods and they not only kick up the heat in making the dish for him, but will also provide additional heat additions for him to use at the table.  It is definitely our \"Go To\" spot for sushi and Japanese food.  The interior is always clean and although it's small, there always seems to be a place to sit (which probably comes from all the take-out they do).    Pros: Great food Sushi is fresh Prices are very reasonable Staff is extremely helpful Clean (which is super important to me)  Cons: Street parking (but it's Bloomfield so it's expected)  Overall, we are faithful customers and will continue to be.",

Not too fast, not too slow. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed. TV for those who want to watch the game.   I ordered the edamame for an appetizer. It was good, but not great. May have been a little older than I would've liked. The sushi was very reasonably priced. The fish was fresh and delicious! The pretty girl roll was my favorite. Sweet potato roll was an interesting one too! See mt picture for the whole plate! Can't wait to go back to Ginza.",

They have a really flexible sushi roll lunch special - you can choose 2 or 3 rolls from an extensive list and it comes with either miso soup or a salad. The miso soup was particularly good and both of my daughters, who are often hit-or-miss about miso, really liked it.   The sushi was great - fresh and meaty.  My husband got some fancier rolls and we were impressed by the flavor combinations. We will definitely be back to try more rolls, hopefully soon!",

I thought the sushi was a bit over priced, some rolls got up to $15 which is pretty steep. The rolls were all very tasty but it is definitely not a cheaper sushi place. Our waitress talked very quietly and it was sometimes hard to hear what she was saying. I think she may have been newer so we didn't mind too much.   My friend got the teriyaki sauce with her hibachi but she said it tasted pretty average.  overall i liked Yokoso at the Waterfront area better so i'm unsure if i'd come back but it was still a good experience!",

Ginza was one of the options so as a good yelper, I had to follow people's reviews. We came here on a Saturday during lunch which there were a couple of people enjoying their meals. We were seated immediately and realized that they had a reasonable lunch menu. We ordered the bento boxes which comes with soup/salad, rice, california rolls, siu mai and your main dish. As a healthy option, I got the steamed chicken with vegetables which comes with a savory sauce on the side. We also got the tofu bento box. The tofu was fried and delicious! It came with a sweet sauce (duck sauce maybe?). The food was good and it will definitely fill you up. Sooo... it's a great spot to try for sushi or bento boxes!",

This has officially become the take-out of choice when my parents are visiting from out of town as well. We always order 6-8 rolls and it comes so perfectly  presented even for it being packed to bring home. I absolutely love the Red Tiger roll, you get spicy salmon and shrimp tempura all in one roll. It's like getting two rolls in one which makes the price completely reasonable and worth it. Every specialty roll we've tried is great and they also do a great job with the traditional rolls if you are looking to keep it simple.   If you have someone in your group like my dad, that is still working on the \"raw fish\" concept, they have both Teriyaki entree options and hibachi dinners.",

Our waitress was very attentive, but not over bearing. We ordered edamame as an app and then we eat for a couple of sushi rolls for dinner.   Everything came out pretty quickly and tasted very fresh. They had so many roll options, it was hard to narrow it down... but that's definitely a good dilemma to have.   I told myself I have to dine in here more often because it was a great experience.   P.s. - takeout is effortless too. My food has always been ready for the time they said it would. Parking in that part of Bloomfield isn't terrible either, especially in the evenings!",

I get upset when one buys expensive sushi only to find that the rolls are absolutely tiny.   The restaurant itself is never incredibly busy, I think a lot of people decide to take-out. The dining area is clean and sleek. The owner is usually the one who greets you; she is very friendly and will recognize after only a few times of coming in.   I usually get the avocado roll and the sweet potato tempura roll. The sweet potato one is actually a bit bigger than the normal rolls and it has a special sauce drizzled over it. It is good with or without soy sauce. Order at lunch and you get a soup or salad. I love the dressing for the salad! The lettuce leaves a little to be desired.   Good food. Not much else to say!

I was looking for a place to satiate my craving after visiting a friend at West Penn Hospital.  Of course I pulled up Yelp and to my surprise, Ginza was barely a two block walk away!  The photos looked tasty and my dining companion and I were able to go in and get a table right away.  The waitress was pleasant and everything from our order came out SO fast.  We started with the clear soup which was very similar to the mushroom soup I love at Silk Road, except Ginza uses a darker broth.  It was delicious and the perfect thing to warm me up on a frigid February evening.    For our sushi selections, we had a California roll (I can never pass these up!), Aloha roll (yellowtail and jalapeno topped with spicy tuna), Naruto roll (tuna and salmon wrapped in cucumber, no rice!), and salmon sashimi.  I kid you not, our food came out probably less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  It was all fantastic and I really enjoyed the Aloha roll.    I don't get over this way too often, but I'm glad to have found another yummy sushi spot for when I get that hankering... it happens more often than I should probably admit!  I did notice a BYOB sign in the front window, so that seems like as good of an excuse as ever for me to get back here soon.",

So imagine my surprise when one day my friends brought me to Ginza and I had some seriously delightful sushi. Not the best sushi of my life, not Jiro dreams of sushi. But very delicious, good consistency sushi on par with places in Philly. So the person who told me there was no good sushi is seriously uninformed and Ginza is awesome. Last time I was there I ordered one of the special rolls ad they made a dragon out of sauce on my plate. I'll post a photo. It was delightful. I'll be returning. a lot. I promise.",

Not amazing, but the regular rolls are solid and some of the specialty rolls are very good. My personal favorite is the Greenwich roll. Prices are reasonable, even by Pittsburgh standards, and the restaurant is BYOB.   The service was a little rocky when the restaurant opened, but it has steadily improved since then and now is good. I wouldn't celebrate my wedding  anniversary there, but it seems like a good place to go with friends or your partner for sushi.",

We ordered a kani salad and the tartar to start. The kani salad was not as traditional as we are used to but good non the less. Now the tartar was probably one of the best tartars I have ever had. It came with some ponzu/yuzu dipping sauce and cucumbers to scoop it up with. Deffiantly delicious.     Now for the rolls. We ordered 4 rolls. 2 traditional (spicy tuna and salmon) and 2 of their specialty rolls. All were very good and larger in size than I am typically used to. Fatter if you will.     Food quality and taste ranked high for us. Price was a little higher than most Pittsburgers would be used to. But with what you save on the alcohol and the quality of fish it is worth it. (1 soup, 1 salad, 1 tartar, 2 traditional rolls, and 2 specialty rolls came to $67)    Only sort of downfall was the ambiance. We were one of only two tables in there. Probably wouldve felt a little more comfortable if it was a little noisier or busier. However, we will deffiantly be back soon!",

    "text": "Food: Ginza offers traditional Japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles, with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well. We started with the miso soup, which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night. We followed with the edamame appetizer. Its hard to mess up edamame, and Ginza definitely didn't, but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average dish stand out. There were other interesting appetizer choices, like seaweed salad, fresh spring rolls, and avocado salad, all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame. We then ordered the vegetable sushi roll, which contained avocado, asparagus, and cucumber (any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll). The roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made. There were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu; tofu vegetable teriyaki, tofu tempura, vegetable hibachi, and vegetable udon noodles. The udon noodles can be prepared pan-fried or in broth soup-style. The pan-fried udon noodles were quite bland, covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice. The tofu teriyaki was slightly more interesting, with a thicker, more tasty sauce, but wasn't anything memorable and some of the vegetables were cold on the inside. The tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside. Ginza does not put any hot sauce, pepper seeds, or chili paste on the table, and also do not offer a spiciness scale, so you can't really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor. The lead-ins to the main course were not bad but not great, and the entrees were pretty lackluster. Overall, it seems as if Ginza doesn't have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items. Meat and fish eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying.  Price: The prices were very reasonable, as we ordered two soups, an appetizer, a sushi roll, and two entrees for under $30. We were hungry, so we didn't have enough left to bring home (although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor), but the portion sizes are above average.   Drinks: Ginza is BYOB but they do offer Japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit tables. There are tables for small and large parties, and enough space so that you aren't sitting directly on top of your neighbors. However, the restaurant is basically one big room and when the door opens on a cold night, you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are anywhere near the front. It isn't too difficult to find a parking spot on Liberty or one of its side streets.  Service: We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, often checking our table and re-filling our water. We requested an addition of tofu to the udon noodles, which the waitress approved, but when the plate came the tofu was missing. We were also served our appetizer, sushi, and entrees within five minutes of each other, creating a table full of hot food getting cold.  (+): cheap prices, large portions  (-): average to below-average vegetarian food  Would I go back again? Probably not, although I wouldn't stop a meat-eating friend from giving Ginza a shot.",

My favorite was the sweet potato tempura roll. It was different and delicious! Why go out and try a new restaurant if you're just going to order the same old thing?  My girlfriend's favorite roll was the Spicy Girl roll. It was full of flavor and not too spicy to the point where it was too hot to eat.  We also loved the Philadelphia Roll and Shrimp Tempura.  All in all, there was nothing not to like. It was delicious, clean, the staff was friendly, and it was BYOB!  I will B-YO-Back!",

We ordered miso soup, garden salad, tuna tartar, edamame, 4 plates of sashimi, a plate of sushi, tuna rolls, a specialty roll, and chicken and shrimp tempura.   The fish was all very good and fresh although the cuts were too thick for my liking. The salmon was particularly good for Pittsburgh. The (red) tuna was lackluster, but the albacore was delicious.   The tempura was both large and delicious. Some of the best shrimp tempura I have ever had.   The waiter was very attentive and overall the place was receptive of our group of loud individuals (albeit we were alone). Total price including corkage fee for both beer and sake was $106.

    "text": "After locking my keys inside my apartment I decided to head over to Ginza for a bite to eat.   Usually the service at Ginza is pretty solid but I don't know what happened? I was the only person their besides the server, MARGRET, and the  chef.   I had initially ordered the House Salad, Gyoza, and Sweet Potato Roll.   I was then brought out only my Gyoza which was fine but when the server repeated my order she said \"only two orders Gyoza and Sweet Potato Roll\" I quickly corrected and let her know that I wanted my House Salad which she said she would get but as she whisked her self away said that actually nevermind I didn't want the salad anymore and kept yelling it after she had went to the back hoping someone had heard me ...i guess not. I wasn't trying to be difficult but if it wasn't made the first time it wasn't a big deal not to have it. By the time she got back I had received my salad and told her that for the 9th time I said I no longer wanted it. She then looked at me with a \"are you serious right now\" look and walked away with salad in hand while saying something i couldn't understand.   While I was eating my Gyoza roll close to finishing the last bite my sweet potato roll arrived and the server then rushed to take away my Gyoza and I had to yell at her \"I'm still eating\". She then once again whisked herself away in what seemed to be annoyance. What did I do?   After finishing both dishes my glass of water was left empty and since I couldn't find anyone peered into the back and then quietly went back to my seat where she popped her head up from the front. She then refilled my glass then asked me cash or credit but I hadn't even seen my bill yet. I asked her if she could bring my check.  Terrible service with an overly pushy server. I do love the food here but personally they could hire better servers in my opinion.   Please keep in mind that this review is solely based mostly on the service here and not the food!",

    "text": "2.5 / 5 - House Salad: Tangy sweet dressing, but the salad was a bit watery and had more iceburg lettuce than I like.  Subsequent visits have been much better, though. 2.5 / 5 - Tuna Avocado Roll: Slightly above average-sized,  tender and fresh.  A well done simple and pure roll. 2.5 / 5 - Spicy Salmon Roll: Finely chopped, not ground, salmon with a bit of crunchiness and spicy mayo. 2.5 / 5 - Spicy Yellowtail Roll 1.5 / 5 - Yellowtail Roll: The yellowtail chunks are not as tender as the others, so I much prefer this in spicey chopped form. 1.5 / 5 - Spicy Girl Roll: This roll lost much of its crunchiness, especially when compared to the two other spicy rolls.  There was too much mayo and mushiness. 3.0 / 5 - Tuna Lover Roll: Added some flare to the simple elegant tuna flavor which was not overpowering.  Nice lunch special.",

    "text": "HELLO GINZA!   I found this little gem last week. And I love it! It is by work, which is trouble city for me. Twice last week I visited, and I don't plan on slowing down.   Though I must say, I have never tried any of the meals. I am reviewing on strictly sushi. The sushi was awesome. Way bigger than expected, and for what I know of freshness, seemed fresh. Try the Tuna Lover Roll if you want a specialty roll. Every one that I have tried I liked. You probably can't go wrong.  Staff was super friendly and attentive. Sushi prices are very reasonable. What can I say, I found my sushi go to in Pittsburgh! I can't wait to go back! (probably today!)",

    "text": "First, I thought this was the Ginza from the olden days of Oakland...a land far far away. I got food poisoning once at that one, as well as delicious korean food on other occasions.  For those without reading comprehension, this is a DIFFERENT GINZA.  The plan was a hurry up offense, of watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, and then getting sushi. I called an audible, as we had to wait until the next day to watch Jiro (and then wanted to go back!)  We with a few rolls, (eel, salmon, and spicy yellowtail) to test the waters. All were delicious. Simple, tasty, filling. I am not really a sushi guy either.  BYOB was  a huge plus, and as per usual, I ended up drinking more than my fair share. The service was very attentive, and friendly.   After nom-ing on those rolls, we decided to try a main dish- The wasabi steak. I ordered it rare, they understood what rare mean. King Richard was pleased.  The wasabi sauce was almost buttery with a bit less kick than I would have liked. Overall it was pretty good, not breathtaking, but good.  The price is very reasonable, especially compared to other recent dining (Sausalido) that was far less yummy.  Ginza is going to find its way  into my rotation like NOW that's what I call music volume 6. I'm serious!",

    "text": "Went for my weekly sushi fix to Chaya, only to find it closed for the week. A disappointed Ramee and friend frantically Yelp a sushi joint within a reasonable distance. Ginza was destiny. We were quickly seated and served by an upbeat waitress whose sole purpose in life, it seemed, was to refill my water. I liked that.   A $2.25 house salad (with the usual ginger-y dressing) is enormous. While not as flavorful as that which crowns the puny pile of greens at Chaya, the dressing was acceptable, even if it was more mayo than ginger.   Many sushi restaurants, I've found, skimp out on the fish and wrap their rolls with heaping layers of rice to cut costs. Ginza is no such place. The sushi is wonderful--rationed just the way I like it, with a generous helping of quality fish, a thick chunk of avocado, and a delicate layer of rice. (It's not on the menu, but they can make a Yellowtail/Avocado roll if you ask..)   .:. Ginza warrants a repeat visit, which is quite the compliment from this sushi aficionado.",

    "text": "Sushi was very good, appetizers were a bit lackluster.  We had the potstickers and the seaweed salad apps.  The potstickers were the exact same ones that I buy in a huge bag at Costco, I'm 99% sure of it, down to the little packet of dipping sauce that comes with it.  The seaweed salad was good, but not amazing.  The sushi is where the magic is.  Not the absolute best I've had, but also far from the worst, and some of the best in Pittsburgh for sure.  The service was quick and attentive, but they certainly lack some of the table-side manner of other restaurants. They are all business - take your order, deliver your food, nothing more, nothing less.  That's fine by me.  They also have a nice BYOB option with a reasonable corkage fee.  I'll go back again (and have already) because their special sushi rolls are tasty, the portions generous, and the BYOB reasonably priced.",
