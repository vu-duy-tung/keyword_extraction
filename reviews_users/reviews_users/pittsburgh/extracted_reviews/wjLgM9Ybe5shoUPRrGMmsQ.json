The secret is to call ahead on weekends and put your name on the list- today they said the wait would be an hour and a half and it was more like one hour. Today I had the special eggs Benedict which was to die for and my BF had the chicken and waffles. Even though the wait is long it's well worth it and it is a fun area to explore while waiting. Enjoy!",

I went here with my gf (who absolutely loves this place) for the first time with past weekend during a pretty busy time but I would have waited twice as long and paid twice as much for the brown sugar gridle cakes. There's no words that exist in the english language that describe how amazing these were so I won't do the injustice of trying! My gf had the curry chicken salad. I've never had curry anything before but she made me try it and it was amazing. All I can think about now is which one am I going to get next week.  I'd like to get both but I dare not waste either If I couldn't get them both down!",

There is always a line and a wait and I feel the food was just ok....the line and wait is more about no other breakfast options in the area. I would not recommend this restaurant. We are always searching for new places and customer service is essential in this economy. The restaurant also opened 10 minutes late. Very dissapointing experience.",

One Tuesday morning this summer when the place was not crowded, we had to wait over 15 minutes before the waiter bothered to clean off an empty table and seat us.  What was he doing in the meantime?  Cleaning off the main counter  (where no one was waiting).  Later, when I asked another waiter for a refill on my coffee so I could continue eating my breakfast, he said sure but never came back. And what was he doing in the meantime?  Putting away the flatware.  When I finally managed to get the attention of someone else, he came to the table with a poorly disguised attitude. I don't understand how a place can train or allow their staff to purposely avoid the customers.",

The food was very interesting too. The menu was diverse, and I ended up getting the special - pork tenderloin sandwich. It was a little smaller than what I expected, but it was very tasty. I also tried my friend's club sandwich - it was large and filling and tasty. Almost every entree came with side salad or quinoa, which makes a very balanced diet, I have to say.",

    "text": "This used to be our favorite restaurant. We frequented Coca Cafe weekly to enjoy their almond coffee and organic beautifully presented food. Lately, the restaurant is declining rapidly. I am not sure it they are under new management, but they have now lost our business. One weekday morning the restaurant was randomly closed. Upon returning ( hoping it was open), a few weeks later, we were told they were out of a few items on the menu only after ordering for that specific item. For example, I ordered pancakes for the vanilla butter and lavender mint syrup, both of which they informed me they didn't have after I asked why it wasn't served with the meal. The service consists of being treated with a condescending, curt manor. The atmosphere is almost as if you're very lucky to be there and not that they are lucky to have your patronage. The next time we went back a week later, hoping it was just a bad experience, it took 45 minutes to receive our food of which our order was wrong causing us to be late for work. No apology was given, and we were actually treated like a nuisance. We did not even complain. We then wanted a make a reservation for 20 people for my birthday ( as this is still my favorite restaurant for breakfast) and were laughed at and told condescendingly that reservations are not accepted, even for parties of 20. We were then told we are more than welcome to come at 8/830 and attempt to take turns with seating times because they are so busy. The last straw was this morning when upon leaving the strip district from shopping we saw Coca Cafe and excitedly parked and went it. We asked to sit outside and were told no because it \" might rain later\". They have tables undercover, so I asked for one of those. They rudely told me no. We were then told the wait was 35-40 minutes ( no one else was waiting or in line). Then we asked if we could simply leave with two almond coffees to go. They motioned to the coffee/ juice bar chairs that are normally out for a quaint little spot to enjoy their coffees and teas, which are now shoved under the bar, and very rudely told us this option is not available on weekends and turned us away. We are officially done with coca cafe... Until we hear they are run differently with appreciation for their regular customers who spend upwards from 40/50 on breakfast weekly.",

I'm all about waking up early for good chow, but it seemed a little ridiculous to wait in line to eat BEFORE a restaurant opened.  However, this is really the way that you have to do it at Coca Cafe on a Sunday.  We were the first people in line and were immediately seated on the back patio in the first wave of folks.    I ordered the scrambled eggs with chorizo and the creamy polenta stuffed bell pepper.  I could have died and gone to brunch heaven.  I am going to dream about that breakfast for a LONG time.  My friend order the crab hash with fried eggs, which was decent but a little dry for my liking.  The coffee was delicious and my side of fruit was divine.    I would have given Coca Cafe 5 stars on food alone, but the whole production to get a seat is a bit much.  I want to go back again, but I don't know if I can convince any of my drunkard friends to wake up extra early on a Sunday.",

So, I usually give restaurants a chance, I truly love Pittsburgh and it's cultured little joints, but seriously, EVERY time I come here I have some kind of tragic experience with the wait staff.   1. They NEVER take names. People are confused, and all huddled in the front.  2. The waitresses are mean, rude, overworked, and need to chill out.  3. They do not clear the tables quickly enough and you can stand waiting for an empty table to be cleared for up to 20 minutes, it's annoying!  But all in all, the food is 5 stars, I just wish they would hire more help and re-arrange the seating to be more useful. All in all, worth the wait with one friend. Just don't bring a family or a bunch of people.",

Also, really, really good for vegetarians.  My favourites are definitely the breakfast sandwich and the fried eggplant benedict. Any/all omelettes are pretty fab too. In my opinion, the food is underpriced (which means I can afford it without complaints) in terms of quality, size, and value. This is a wonderful thing.  Always get the brekkie potatoes as a side when offered. So good.  Only downsides to this place - the coffee is terrible. It's pretty much generic restaurant/diner coffee standards, which is okay but this is a great breakfast place! Come on guys. And I've never ordered a latte or anything, but they scorch it beyond belief. You can just hear the milk crying across the entire cafe every time they steam a latte.  The service can also be way better. It's breakfast, so I get that it's early and all, but a smile wouldn't hurt? Or like... a sincere recommendation? It definitely has a cozy charm, but then where is the friendly waitstaff?  So while I brunch-hop on the weekends, Coca is THE great breakfast place in Pittsburgh that has stolen my heart... and my weekday mornings.",

    "text": "Went to Coca Cafe for brunch with my boyfriend. He's been here before and was a fan, so I was excited to give it a try. We waited 30 min to sit down, okay fine, it's Sunday brunch and I feel that's pretty standard. We were finally seated and when it was ready to order the waiter told us that it would be a 40 min wait. I feel that we should've been warned about that long before we were seated, but we were hungry and so we waited and waited....and waited for over an hour. We finally got our food and the entree itself was okay but the potatoes were raw. We asked for a side of toast which was good but let's be real, who can mess that up. We waited for over and hour and a half for food and finished our meal in 5 min. We left the restaurant feeling underwhelmed and annoyed. Will not be back.",

    "text": "Excellent food, horrible service. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because the food was good. Took 15 minutes for our waitress to approach our table to take our order. Took at least another 15 minutes for our drinks to be delivered- it felt like we were invisible. We asked our waitress to check on our drinks and got a snarky remark back- then she never came to our table again to check on how we were doing. I tried to customize my order (it wasn't a big request) and the waitress got irritated with me and told me she would give me the regular meal and I could just pick off the stuff I didn't want. On the plus side, they are pretty vegetarian friendly, so I guess that's good, if you can get past the awful service. It's really a shame because the food was really good, but I'll never go back again because of the awful service.",

    "text": "Everything taste great!! Me and my husband were looking for a new place to try breakfast. I know Lawrenceville has a lot of great restaurants so we decided to peruse the streets find a local eatery. After looking through Yelp to see which one had the  best rating, we settled on cocoa cafe.  It's a very small cafe seating only about 20 people at a time but they do have outdoor seating which was great especially since it was warm that day. Their menu changes constantly so one day you might see something and in the next week it's no longer there. I love how fresh the food is and how awesome the flavors are. My husband ordered the fried eggplant Benedict and I went with the bean quesadilla. His eggplant Benedict was so amazing, I mean the flavors pop so well. The eggplant was crispy, the eggs were over easy and the muffin was perfectly buttered.  My quesadilla was just as good. I love how the beans were slightly mushy not crunchy like some other places have been. They also served it with a side of sour cream. We also tried the zucchini bread which came with a small side of fruit and an almond cream cheese topping. The bread was so warm and soft and  had small pieces of chocolate chips in them, even though I don't like chocolate I have to say that this was darn good.  To top off our meal I ordered a French soda which is basically like an Italian soda but they add cream to it. I never had one before but I definitely would go back for another. On a scale of 1 to 10 this place for me is definitely a nine. I'm looking forward to going back and trying something new especially since their menu always changes. I know I'll have something fresh and creative to look forward to.",

While we were waiting for our food the people at the next table began complaining about waiting over an hour. Bad enough that the manager was rude to him but two other staff decided to jump in and gang up on him.  The manager was not polite to him at all. It left a bad taste in my mouth so we decided to leave as well. Surprise when I spoke with the manager she couldn't be bothered to be polite to me either. Apparently the expected wait for breakfast at this restaurant is an hour (and that's after the usual hour wait in line). No wonder there was no line with a manager who is so short with people. Not a good idea on a street with 400 other great restaurants.",

If you want to know what I mean by must have, go to the Blue Moon in Fells Point.    My omelette sounded like it would be great, but it was unimpressive.  The same can be said for the French toast.  The bacon was the high point of the meal. Thank God for that.   Service started out attentive and then pretty much ceased which was disappointing.  If the service is good, we will go to places with mediocre food like Coca Cafe.  The service sealed my lack of desire to want to come back.",

    "text": "The two biggest problems with hype? Being able to get a seat, and the increased expectations that can quickly lead to feeling letdown.  Coca Cafe, for me, suffers from both of these, unfortunately. For years, I've been wanting to go, but I simply haven't found a restaurant in Pittsburgh that's so far ahead of itself and competitors that I'm willing to wait more than 10-15 minutes to eat. For once, we happened to be walking by just before opening and figured, why not!?!  The atmosphere is pretty good. We sat in the back sunroom-like space. It was nice and bright. We also liked that every table was a two-top in that area, which meant that we weren't surrounded by the boisterous kids in the front of the restaurant. There's definitely nothing wrong with taking the kids to breakfast, but it's nice that the restaurant setup sort of creates a separation for people who want a more relaxed atmosphere.  The service was decent. Attentive at first, then there were seemingly-long periods of time before we could place our order and get/pay our check. My water was continually topped off in between, though, which is always a bonus!  Unfortunately, all of the positives were for nothing when I tried the food. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, BUT it wasn't even close to deserving the hype. There are breakfast spots all over the country with reasons to wait. For challenge-like, but delicious 12-egg omelets at Beth's in Seattle, incredibly decadent pancakes at The Bongo Room in Chicago, Cap'N Crunch french toast or Sweet Baby Jesus at Blue Moon in Baltimore. Those places have specific things that are worth the wait. Nothing on the menu touched on any of those levels. Nothing over-the-top. Nothing truly unique.   My challah french toast with brie, fig jam, and fruit sounded brilliant, but literally had 2 strawberries and 5 blueberries on it. I opted not to cover it in maple syrup, hoping that it could blow me away on its own. Instead, I was hit with a lot of bland bread, with a few bites of delicious brie. It was decent, but I would've been truly bummed had I waited 45 minutes for such a dish. My wife's omelet was pretty good, but even if I had ordered her meal, I wouldn't have been blown away. Her potatoes were very basic, which I actually like, but again...who waits for \"basic\" these days? The highlight of my meal was the apple smoked bacon. It was perfectly cooked (I prefer the chewier bacon), and a great balance of sweet and salty.   Would I go again? Sure, but there's nothing notable that has me itching to return. There was nothing truly wrong with my meal or experience, but the hype had my expectations sooooooo much higher...which is what led to such disappointment around a perfectly decent meal.",

In my opinion standing within eyesight of 4 employees and being ignored, sets a  bad tone. If you would like guests to seat themselves, post a sign. If not, a simple \"Hey someone will be right with you\", would go a long way. I should have turned around then, instead my husband and I sat ourselves only to be scolded and then allowed to remain seated. The service that followed was no surprise. I waited so long for the check that I half considered sending my husband to walk down to the ATM to pick up cash just to leave on the table. The food was mediocre at best. The only part either of us enjoyed were the classic mimosas. No part of the meal would be worth a return trip.",

Just be prepared to wait an hour or two depending on when you get there. You do have to wait outside because there is no where to really wait inside. However, if you want a divine brunch you should definitely check this place out!  I had the french toast and it was amazing. I had such a hard time deciding what to order because it all looked delicious. Their menu changes a bit too so there are different things to try depending when you go. I liked their menu because it was unique and a bit more special than your standard brunch menu. They definitely give you a good amount of food for the price. It smells so yummy that you get more and more hungry while you wait.   It is a bright, little brunch cafe. There are several tables in the front room and a little narrow room in the back with more intimate tables. There is one bathroom for both men and women that was not very clean. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group. I would say there was maybe one table that held possibly 6 or 7 people, but the rest of the groups were 2 and up to 4. The staff was friendly and checked on us an average amount. We did have to wait to have our waters refilled a few times, but other than that no complaints. I would definitely wait again to eat here.",

    "text": "I was going with my girlfriend to spend an afternoon Christmas shopping (read: walking around and checking out all the shops) in Lawrenceville and we decided to start with brunch at Coca Cafe, which one of my coworkers had suggested.  Neither of us had been to Coca before, though a few Sundays earlier we had wanted to go for breakfast, but we were (read: she was) hungry before the place opened.  That's disappointing, since we both ended up really liking it.  We got there around 10:50 on Saturday and they said there was a half hour wait.  They took our phone number and we went outside for a quick stroll (it was a beautiful day with light snow-but don't worry, the weather isn't affecting my review).  We got back after around twenty minutes, waited another five, and then were seated.  Our waitress was very pleasant, though slightly awkward (in a charming way), and the service was good.  The ambience was very nice for brunch - well-lit, kind of busy, but still able to easily converse with your companion(s).  I ordered the herb-goat cheese French toast and she got the smoked salmon omelette (with pumpernickel toast).  The French toast was fantastic.  Perfectly browned on the outside, soft on the inside, it was cooked wonderfully, and the goat cheese and herbs were a great addition.  And the (real) maple syrup came in one of those pot things with the sliding top - only smaller and cuter than the ones you usually see.  The omelette was very good as well.  The salmon was delicious and the egg was as good as any I've had at a restaurant (though I'd still say I've never had a better-cooked omelette out than at home).  Coca Cafe is a great restaurant - one of the best I've been to in the 'Burgh.  As I've been writing this review (and even this sentence), I've been flipping back and forth between four and five stars.  I really wish I could give Coca 4-1/2 stars, but I guess I can't.  I'll just sum it up by saying it's an excellent restaurant in an awesome neighborhood and I look forward to going again.  A definite recommend.  Side note - I haven't read any of the other reviews, but did anyone else who was there with a boyfriend/girlfriend get seated in what we called the \"Couples Corner?\"  We noticed that all the people in the back nook area were male/female couples and that there were two obviously non-couple women sitting at a four-person table in the front room when there was room in the back.  Less relevant side note - Why does Google Chrome think \"omelette\" isn't a word.  It accepts \"omelet,\" but when you look up suggestions for \"omelette,\" \"omelet\" doesn't even make the list!  Cause, yeah, I'm trying to say I got a smoked salmon flannelette.",

The first time I went was with my man friend and we managed to find a 2-top with no issues. I ordered the egg white omelet on the menu and it came with toast.  One of my gripes is that the omelets only come with potatoes on sundays (same price....hmmm, interesting). Toast was hearty but the omelet was on the smaller side.   The second time was with the larger group so they said they would call us in 20 min when our table was ready.....50 minutes later we get a call.  Service was slow but the place was busy.  The specials impressed me more on this sunday.  I ordered the egg white frittata with goat cheese and sweet potatoes. Yum.  We also had some pumpkin pancakes for the table also great.   Pros: Cute interior, sunday specials, interesting omelets, friendly service, Lawerenceville location  Cons: Long waits, slow but friendly service, no potatoes during the week, trendy can mean pricey   Overall: I like pamelas, and square cafe better but this place is good. Given the location I will definitely be back!",

Waited 20 mins for our server to even approach our table. Waited 45 mins without seeing our food or even having our server come back to refill our drinks. Finally, I went up to pay for the food so that I could leave as soon as we ate and our server asked \"how was your meal?\". I told her we hadn't even received it and her reply was \"oh\". Then a minute later someone from the kitchen brought our food out. We had no silverware, and I walked up to the counter and grabbed the silverware myself (as our server watched me).  The food looked like it had been sitting for twenty minutes. Neither of us ate more than two bites- my friend had the eggs benedicte and I had the curry chicken salad and sweet potato fries. Both were terrible, and our server never again approached our table to even ask how the food was.   Coca used to be a Lawrenceville staple that I frequented. How they've managed to plummet so far in service and food quality over the years is astounding.   Unless you can find a time machine to go back to Coca six years ago, stay the hell away from this place!",

But this past Sunday our meal was next level good.  I had a brunch special - the sausage trio. It was breathtakingly delicious. Two of the sausages were house made. One of them, the duck sausage, was easily one of the most delicious things (in general) that I've eaten. In fact, I cant stop thinking about it. If it were a regular menu item I'd be there daily. The trio was served with lentil and crispy kale (or one of those leafy green veggies that never really excite me). I'm never huge on lentil or kale/leafie green veggie, but they were simply perfect with the dish, adding the perfect amount of sweet and crispiness. Two perfectly poached eggs which blended magically with the lental and leafy green. To top it off there was an amazing sauce, couldve been a holandaise, but their version - rich but not too thick, sweet but not over whelming, and deliciously creamy but not too hearty. I told the server it was easily one of the best meals I've eaten since moving to Pittsburgh two years ago. First thing I did at work today was tell my co-workers how amazing it was.  I'm not a frequent review writer or food experience sharer but the perfection of my meal necessitated this glowing review.",

    "text": "I stopped by Coca Cafe in Lawrenceville to meet a client for breakfast this Sunday.  When I arrived, there was a small line, probably 20 people.  The cafe was due to open at 10am, and the locals were eager to be the first seated.  Coca Cafe is small; probably 40 seats total.  The inside is full of colors, and diner-type tables.  There's an espresso bar in the middle of the restaurant.  We sat in a room behind the main dining room at a small two-top.  Our waitress arrived, took our drink orders, and disappeared.   With the entire restaurant full at once, I began to wonder how the kitchen and wait-staff would handle the onslaught of customers.  Our drinks came (strong coffee and delicious fresh squeezed orange juice), and we placed our food order.  I chose an omelet with avocado, jack cheese and cherry tomatoes.  My client had the same; we also asked for some fruit, and dry wheat toast.  As we discussed an upcoming event, I noticed that a considerable amount of time had elapsed.  It had been 30 minutes since we placed our food order, and there was no food in sight.  I also noticed that the other diners were sans food as well.  Gulp, gulp, my juice was gone, as was the coffee.  My stomach was grumbling... where was the food? Finally, after an hour and 10 minutes our omelets arrived.  We both dug in.  Overall, the food was good- the eggs were a bit overcooked, and the portion of home-fries was minuscule.  My fruit was served in a thimble-sized container; very few berries to enjoy.  I think we may have picked a bad day to have breakfast at Coca Cafe.  Perhaps a cook called off, or some of the kitchen was sick- I hope to have a better experience next time.",

It took another 5 minutes for another waitress/hostess to tell us there was an hour and 15 minute wait.

    "text": "This NYC kid is very disappointed.   After taking a 25 mins bus ride, I walked into Coca Cafe around 1:30pm with no wait. Was given some utensils (the first set, the napkin was stained and I asked for a new one) and was told to sit wherever I wanted which i did.  I proceeded to ask the waitress which beverage is better btw a mocha and caramel latte and was told the famous I don't care \"it's up to you\". Which resulted in the worst hot mocha I've ever tasted. Although I barely touched it, she didn't care to ask why. The cup with the mocha was so dirty with the chocolate running down, like seriously Pittsburgh?   I ordered sourdough toast with cashew butter and banana composite and added a egg, which was really good!   I then ordered a matcha latte that was ridiculously sweet, but still okay.   The entree of grilled local chicken and Brie on a challah was absolutely horrible. The chicken tasted like it was boiled and simply plated with no flavor or seasoning. The combination of that thick bread stuffed with so much fig jam, easily turned it into a dessert.   Finally, I don't have enough facts to say it's a race thing but I did not feel welcomed.    However, the way both waitresses treated me during my stay made me feel quite uncomfortable as though they wasn't pleased with my presence. - I'm saying this based of their interaction with everyone else in front of me. Although, I did order the most for one person sitting at the time.  This resturant has inspired me to visit more areas in Pittsburgh and write honest reviews as I'm here for school, might as well see what the food scene is all about.   Needless to say, I'd never recommend this place to anyone. Not even college kids based of this experience.",

We used NoWait and by 11:40 we got a text saying our table is ready! Great. Cool. Well, our waiter didn't even come and greeted us until 20 minutes later after we sat down. So when he arrived, we wasted no time and ordered our food right away. This is where things went downhill for me... I KID YOU NOT, we waited so long for our food to come out. Around 1:30 our food DIDN'T even come out yet. It was literally around that time that's when one of the workers dropped by our table and told us it will be only 3 more minutes for our food to be ready. Ok that's fine if I could could wait an hour and a half for my food I guess I could wait another 3 minutes, right? Or so I thought - that 3 minutes turned into a solid 20 minutes and that's when they finally brought out the food. By this time I was so hangry, sweaty from being annoyed at the service so I didn't even fully enjoy my food. But now come to think of it, to be completely honest, the food REALLY weren't as good like the times we went before. And I know I'm not bullshitting because my friend said the same thing. For all that time we waited, you'd think the food would turn out amazing but nope! Just disappointment after disappointment.   I hate giving 1 star on places I used to love and I understand this might just be a crazy Sunday brunch thing but I have been to many places for Sunday brunch where they're a lot more busier and crazier than Coca Cafe. But their way of service is completely different than here. I didn't have to wait over an hour for anything. I've read reviews about a possible new owner here but it doesn't matter - this is a problem and they need to fix it, especially on Sundays, I guess.   Ps: Literally witnessed this couples waited so long (they came after us) for their food, they just stood up and left after 40 minutes. No lie. Can't make that stuff up. #sad",

Get the cheese plate, and then choose a few small plates to share or some entrees. They'll usually bring out some fresh-made scones and butter at the beginning of the meal, too. Other than that, you can't really go wrong. Everything Coca Cafe offers is fresh and simple. Each dish was the perfect complexity of taste and presentation. Sometimes, food is so good, all you can do is smile and nod your head. Coca Cafe manages to make nearly every dish with that smile-and-nod in mind.",

I am not that big a fan of eggplant, but from reading my fellow yelpers' reviews, I had to check it out! And I was not disappointed. This was absolutely delicious, never would I have thought eggplant could taste this good, and the sauce, oh my, I could dip anything in the basil hollandaise and eat it.

I went to the bathroom that was a Filthy mess. My plate had drier up food on it. The floor was very dirty. I am surprise that coca hasn't been shut down. The service wasn't very good either waited 15 minutes for a server to bring us over water I felt bad they had one girl taking all the orders very under staffed. I never got refills on my beverage. It took 20 mins to get my golden latte. My food well that's a different story that took about 40 minutes. I walked in at 1030 I didn't leave until after 12:00. If you can't find the help then stop running a business.",

I asked if we could order right away since the baby had woken up and we were hoping to get our food before she got fussy. The woman who sat us said she'd send our waiter right over. It took him another 15 minutes to finally take our order. We then sat for almost an hour and waited. The waiter never came to check on us. I finally went to the counter to inquire only to find out they had lost our ticket. The food finally arrived after nearly an hour and a half of being there. And it was cold and average, at best. They gave us a discount for our troubles, but the waiter was rude, the wait was long, and the food was average. We won't be going back.",

Unfortunately, they were sold out so I had to settle for the Arugula salad with chicken and goat cheese fritters ($15). It tasted awesome, and I could probably have eaten 5 of them. No, seriously, I was hungry like 5 min after leaving.

I've been to this place on a couple different occasions and tried their lunch selections (sammies, salads, etc.) and I've always been underwhelmed.  The surprising thing is that people rave about it!  So when this place came up for brunch plans I decided to give it another try.  I had heard the brunch was the best part so I was cautiously optimistic.    I hadn't been here in a while and what I will say is I LOVE LOVE LOVE the renovations.  The bright red paint and the funky artwork really makes this place pop.  So bravo for whoever designed this.  I sat outside on the side of the building, which I never realized was there.  It was so cute and quaint.  I just really love everything about the atmosphere.    I SO wish I could say that about the food.  I love me some almonds and almond flavored meals, so I tried the Almond French Toast.  Sadly, again I was underwhelmed.  When I imagine french toast I want a puffy thick piece of toast.  This came on a flat thin baguette.  Not a fan.  It was drizzled in lemon sauce and had almonds and fruit sprinkled on top.  I could hardly taste the almond flavor over the lemon drizzle.  Was almond extract even used in the egg mixture?  That's what I would have liked.    I wouldn't be opposed to coming here but maybe I'll just pick up a chai latte and enjoy the great atmosphere instead of the food.  So the search is on for some slammin' almond french toast!",

This place is always packed and I have been wanting to go for years.  Finally a Sunday came where I had the time to wait all day and all day it seemed. We were finally seated and the waitress let us pick our table then once we did she changed her mind and sat us somewhere else. Whatever we got a seat and ordered right away as we almost memorized the menu by the time we sat down. They had a lot of great options I could not resist the pumpkin pancakes. They were the perfect texture and flavor with pear on top.  Aja J. who accompanied me for her belated birthday brunch ordered the shrimp po boy. I'm no seafood fan and she wasn't that impressed with it.  The portions were a bit small and pricey so not sure what all the fuss is about but it is a unique menu and cool space inside. They also don't hurry you out which is nice but with all the people waiting maybe they should start. Overall I enjoyed my pancakes and the great company but not sure if I would go back.",

    "text": "Pretty cute place. My first visit was for my Best Friend's birthday.Since Brunch is a Saturday happening thing i wanted to make sure we got in. Originally I called and was told the computers was down, but just come on in anyway there was no wait. I did  express that it would be a group of 5 plus we wanted to come at noon so then I was directed to the online reservation. So my friend receives a text your table is ready, but there is 6 tables ahead of you. About 10 minutes of her receiving the text we arrive and was told NO TABLE. When asked why was because we were not there when they said the table was ready...Okay confusing with 6 tables ahead of us, but we'll wait. To say the least we still got a table within 15 minutes of our arrival. So we ordered and drinks took about 20  minutes before we got them. We actually forgot we ordered a drink! So food time. Everyone's' food comes out except me! So i was offered half of my food (potatoes and fruit) and i ordered an omelette. I myself like hot food and like my food all at once unless i order an appetizer (i declined). The manager/owner was very apologetic and friendly so she paid for my meal. I was a bit disgruntled because we had been waiting some time and when you are hungry...YIKES.. The food is superb. As i get better with yelp i will begin to take pics so people can see. I will say do try!!! for 3 adults and 2 kids the the meal would of been about $100-$120. So breakfast entrees for adults are about $10-$18, adult beverages are $10, soda is $4, kids OJ was $4, and kids meal was about $4-6. Really good food, busy, small, not much space, but enough to eat and get out. Price point is a bit pricey for some of the things, but give it a try",

One of you should get something savory -- like the Bacon and Avocado Omelet [ you did bring a friend, right?! ] -- and one something sweet like the Pumpkin Pancakes [if you happen to go in the fall ]. Sharing is caring so make sure everyone gets ample opportunity to sample the spectrum of goodness.  Get your requisite coffee and [freshly-juiced!] juice and sit back and bask in the sunlight and the dining room's spacious feel.  Now, go on a walk cause you're going to be stuffed and you need to work some of that off.",

Just a few minutes later, Tristan, who did not give us his name but we found out later because his reputation precedes him, was so absolutely incredibly rude. He told us we could not wait in the cafe.  We explained that it was pouring rain, as you could clearly see and hear, and that a waitress just said we could come in out of the rain. He said it didn't matter pretty much verbally pushed us out \"You need to leave now!\" (Out of nowhere and no provocation mind you) and was so rude shut the door behind us before my bag even completely cleared the door.

Thank god there are shops and a coffee place right down the street to entertain yourself while you're waiting.    Once we were seated, we went with the Yelp recommendations of the goat cheese herb stuffed french toast and the fried eggplant eggs benedict.  We decided to go with these two because of the reviews on here, and to save ourselves from the great debate that would have happened otherwise.  EVERYTHING sounded amazing.  I'll definitely be dragging other friends to brunch to try more items on the menu.  Anyway, the french toast lived up to the hype.  However, I think three huge slices of this is a little much.  I'm glad I was sharing.  Tastes incredible, but the cheese and herbs are a little overwhelming after a while.  The benedict was so tasty.  I could have had two plates of it.  Each element was so flavorful and the hollandaise sauce was the \"cherry on top.\"  As I said, I'll be returning very soon.",

I've lived in Lawrenceville for nearly 8 years and, until yesterday, had not dined at this neighborhood favorite.  With wait times always in the hour+ range, I just couldn't do it. But when the fabulous Lauren P. suggested we bite the bullet for a birthday brunch, I happily agreed. We set up camp and waited our turn, enjoying beautiful weather and excellent conversation in the process.  I also spent a great deal of time \"ooh\"ing and \"aah\"ing over Coca's incredible menu. Every single item looked like it was made for me. After much debate, I settled on the Shrimp Po Boy Benedict. I can never say \"no\" to a Po Boy, and loved the idea behind this creative Benedict.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but wowza, was this meal a letdown. The company was still stellar, so I can't complain too much, but at $15 I expected more than two sad little baguette slices and 3 not-so-impressive shrimp. The fried potatoes were very basic and the poached eggs WERE perfect, so there's that.  But really - it just wasn't what I was expecting.  Lauren enjoyed her pumpkin pancakes and overall, we had a wonderful time (even amidst the onslaught of flies in the back dining room - odd for November), but I can't say we'll be back.  On to the next bucket list item!",

We waited and waited and waited for our food, we ordered eggs and pancakes, you know simple breakfast fare, nothing fancy or complicated. An hour went by and still no food, at this point we discussed leaving but decided to stick it out.  After an hour and twenty minutes our food came. It was meh not bad but not great and for sure not worth waiting almost an hour and a half for. The table behind us said something to the waitress after our food arrived because they had placed their order before we did. They said their kitchen is small and they do the best they can to fulfill the orders. I'm sorry but many restaurants have small kitchens yet they have systems in place to execute orders in a reasonable manner. I also noticed other people getting their food served to them before we got ours even though we were seated before they even walked in the door.  Unacceptable! Extremely poor management and complete disregard and disrespect for other people's time. It seems the owners don't care to resolve issues since my experience mimics many others. Sad.",

    "text": "I'm an out-of-town'er and found this place via yelp. I came here for breakfast at 10am on a Saturday. Neighborhood parking. Cute, casual atmosphere. Smallish place that doesn't get too loud. There were no kids, maybe suggesting people with kids don't usually come here though I saw high chairs. Attentive servers. Great food that takes a chance and wins with savory/sweet pairings.   If it is your first time here: walk inside to the register where a hostess should be to get your name and phone #. There will be a wait for breakfast on the weekend. I was only one person so I sat at the bar. I watched groups of 2 wait for 20-25 minutes. This is acceptable if you know what you're getting into. I think people go hang outside and wait for the call.   Now for the food: latte (good, not fancy), blueberry corn griddle cakes with vanilla butter (fantastic, no syrup needed but the syrup is Vermont maple!), house made sage sausage (um, yeah), and poached egg (suggest mixing it with the sausage).",

My girlfriend and I went there for Sunday brunch, we were seated quickly and the host was very nice. We were greeted by our server who was friendly, we ordered 2 caramel apple mimosas, which tasted disgusting and were in glassware that was quite disgusting. We ordered the donut appetizer since we thought it would be quick, wrong, it took about 20 minutes to get three donuts. That wasn't really that big of a deal. So the server (whose name we never got)  put the entree order in the same time as our appetizer. We waited about an hour ish before we decided to call it quits and get up and leave, we left money for what we already ordered since the server took 20 minutes in between visits to the table. We never got our food and had to go else where. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't understand how hipster places like this survive. They have no guest service standards. Disgusting glassware, slow service. It's not a big place so I don't know how anything takes that long. I would give it no stars if I could. This is one of the reasons I hate going to lawrenceville, hipsters give sub par service.",

As others said, when they take your name and phone number, they act as if you SHOULD leave and come back when they call you. This is discouraging and makes for an even longer wait time. I was told the wait was over an hour, yet for the 20 minutes I stayed inside, there were at least 2 tables that went unused. I guess parties were called and still making their way there?  I waited about 10 minutes before being asked what I needed--and the serve only came to me because another group came in. After waiting about 10 more minutes, I asked to be put on the list. Here's the thing: the server said the paper for the list was full so wrote my name on an order sheet. THEN, another server started another list sheet and didn't add my name to the top like it should be. It wasn't until I pointed that out that she added it--all the while acting like I owed her a favor.  I ended up not eating here as the wait was too long and it was clear they didn't want my business. Was looking forward to trying to food but I guess that will never happen. I'm all for small businesses but this is one business that needs to reorganize.",

    "text": "DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. Unless you want absolutely poor service, rude waitresses, sharp objects, and to wait an hour for average food,  DO NOT GO TO COCA. We came in as a group of five and were greeted with a small, 3 seat, dirty table. After being seated, we (tried) to order the coca mocha, and were informed that it had run out (at 10:20 am). My friend instead ordered a mimosa that was less mimosa than simply crushed up ice. Next, we tried to order appetizers, and were informed that the donuts were also sold out (10:40 am). We instead ordered the zucchini bread (actually banana bread) which was served plain with butter. Upon asking questions about the menu, I was received with an arrogant response about what to order. Cue the FORTY MINUTE wait for food. We ordered three full entrees (omelet, eggs, French toast). The other orders were simply avocado toast, bacon, and potatoes. I do not know about you, but I can make avocado toast in about 5 minutes in my own kitchen. The food was average at best, and my friend swallowed a sharp object in her French toast. Upon receiving the bill, there was a 20% tip WRITTEN IN at the bottom. It looked more like a suggestion than an official bill. NO WHERE on the menu was there a stipulation indicating that parties of 5+ should have gratuity added. Had this been written, it would have been honored, however as a customer paying for quite frankly overpriced food for mediocre quality and sub par service, a 20% tip was not justified nor deserved. Upon confronting our waitress both about the shard of glass in the food and the tip situation, we were told \"it is policy\", \"we are renovating the menus\" \"it is a mom and pop shop, we can do what we want\". It is not a policy if it is not written. If I say the sky is pink, does that make it so? NO. It does not. We were finally refunded our tip, but offered no apology. Upon leaving what we saw fit, we left the restaurant, in agreement within our group to never return. At this point we were followed out by our waitress (whose name we never learned) and asked to never come back and informed that our behavior was unacceptable. Given the circumstances, we were diplomats. It will be our pleasure to never return to this awful place. Save your time, save your money, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

If you are with a group, be sure to only send one person inside to put your name in, because it gets pretty tight inside.  Service was bad and slow. I felt bad for the waitress though. Seemed understaffed that day or something. We didn't end up getting half of what we ordered because she would never come back to our table.   The food's good. It's pretentious, pricey brunch and they have some cool menu items. (I had some sort of brisket/grits dish.)

The building looks like a house turned restaurant, with an array of colors inside, cute paintings on the wall, and a welcoming atmosphere.  We arrived around 12:15pm on a friday afternoon.  We waited 30 minutes but it was well worth it!  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed free refills on coffee :) He ordered the Salmon BLT and I ordered the Chicken and Brie Sandwich with a side of potatoes.  We actually ended up switching plates because the Salmon BLT is  more savory than the Chicken and Brie Sandwich.  Salmon BLT: One of the most AMAZING SANDWICHES I have ever had. The bread was toasted, the salmon was moist, crisp bacon with field greens and tomatoes made me a very, very happy customer.  Chicken and Brie Sandwich: I found the chicken a little on the dry side or maybe I was craving for some mayo like component to finish the sandwich a bit more. It's sweeter than an avg sandwich with the melted brie cheese and the thinly sliced apples.  I may have found it just okay, but my boyfriend loved it!  side of Potatoes: I always order a side of potatoes at breakfast places if my dish doesn't already come with it.  They were good but I needed to add my own salt and pepper.  Total plus tax and tip came to be $27.  I'm definitely going to come back for brunch again next time I visit Pittsburgh! This is a great choice if you're looking to catch up with a friend over a cup of coffee or if you want to find a good breakfast/lunch that isn't a greasy spoon kinda place.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a few Sunday's ago with my fiance for an early Sunday brunch.  We were hoping to beat most of brunch crowd there and arrived around 10:30 without using the call ahead seating.  This proved to be a mistake as there was already a wait whenever we got there.  The wait only ended up being 10 minutes or so but the lack of places to wait made it interesting as we had to move off to the side anytime someone wanted to get into or out of the restaurant.  I can't really remember much of the decor of this place although the restaurant was broken up into two distinct dining areas.  The front room was decently spacious with larger tables and the huge front windows providing a ton of light.  The back room was more for the smaller tables as they had a lot of two top booths with the light coming in from side windows.  For my brunch entree I decided to go with the fried eggplant benedict  while my fiance decided to start off with the crab bisque followed by an entree of the sun dried tomato pesto omelet.  My fiances soup was the first item to come out of the kitchen and onto our table and boy was it a large bowl of bisque.  It was also loaded with lump crab meat which surprised me as normally places take the easy way out and just have a few pieces of meat with most of the flavoring belonging to the bisque.  The soup itself was really good being thick and creamy with a nice little taste of sherry in it.  After we had finished the bowl of soup our entrees came out.  My entree consisted of the fried eggplant with a basil pesto hollandaise, poached eggs and some breakfast potatoes.  The eggplant ended tasting decently as did the hollandaise and the potatoes. However I wasn't as enamored with the dish as I expected to be.  I figured that there were two reasons why with one of them having the restaurant being over-hyped to me.  The other is that maybe I once again made a poor entree selection for myself.  The latter is probably most like the truth as I thought my fiances omelet was fantastic, especially the Provence Salami and Buffalo Mozzarella.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  It wouldn't be my first choice of brunch places but I would be interested to see if I chose poorly since all of my fiances food seemed to taste pretty good.",

My lavender steamer was way too sweet and they swapped it with a regular latte no problem (thank you!).",

The building lets a lot of sunlight come in and we were seated in the back so it was breezy and nice. I ordered the avocado omelette and my friend ordered eggs cooked in the red sauce (don't remember the name)   The omelette was good! Fluffy and thick with a dollop of fresh salsa and guac on top, I wasn't disappointed. I loved how they included a slice of watermelon because after the flavor heavy egg and the buttery bread it was so refreshing. My friend also enjoyed the eggs very much. I liked this place because it was unique, breakfast places can make the mistake of being too generic but the environment and food of this place was memorable. Service was alright - right after we got our food, our waitress placed the check on our table so I definitively felt a bit rushed. Will be returning in the future!",

Tip #1: Use the Nowait app otherwise you'll be standing around for at least an hour waiting for a table.  Almost all the menu items were vegetarian - great first impression. I took a walk on the wild side and went with the Shakshuka. Contrary to the menu description, it was not spicy at all. Although I found my meal to be very enjoyable, it was not exactly the mind blowing experience I was expecting. My boyfriend felt the same about his Avocado Omelette.   The service was one of the worst experiences I've had in a while. Aside from the painfully slow service, our waitress brought out the wrong drinks then overcharged us on the bill.   I would agree, the food here tastes great, but definitely NOT worth wasting half my precious Sunday morning for. On to the next brunch spot.",

We went for brunch, where I got the salmon soft scramble. I wasn't the biggest fan of the soft scramble (kinda watery and tasteless aside from the salmon), but it was fresh and there was plenty of salmon in it. The breakfast potatoes that accompanied it weren't the greatest- kind of hard and not very flavorful. Everybody else though seemed to enjoy their food a lot, and I would definitely come back to try one of the other delicious sounding options on the menu.  I did take off a star for service. We used the \"no wait\" app to get in line and arrived at our designed time, yet still had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, the service wasn't much faster. To be fair, the woman waiting on us did seem harried so it's not like this was due to laziness, but still, it seems as though other reviews have noted the slow service as well so maybe they should hire more servers. It wasn't even a particularly busy day either when we went",

    "text": "4.5 stars for food, 2 stars for service. Sounds like I'm not the first to have this lopsided experience at Coca Cafe in recent months. I had the lavender latte to drink. Nicely sweetened, good lavender flavor. Something I won't make for myself at home, so a nice treat. For brunch, I had one of the eggs Benedict options--the club. Toasted bread in place of the English muffin, avocado, the classic poached egg, basil hollandaise, two slices of thick cut bacon and a little salty, savory chorizo on top. I was most impressed with the balance of flavors. Even with the two meats and avocado, the lemon juice of the hollandaise cut the fattiness and rounded out the flavors perfectly. Came with the potatoes on the side and some fruit, and all together it was a hearty but not overwhelming portion. Did I mention the bacon was perfectly crispy? It was!  The service is another story. Long wait to get in, and the seating area is small to be fair so nobody should expect to be seated immediately at 10am when the place is full. When we were asked to order drinks and we said we were ready to order food too, the waitress put us on hold to run a check. I would have rather she took our drink orders and gotten them started anyway, and told us to hold on to our food orders. The 3 coffee drinks were brought out sequentially with delays in between. And at the end of the meal, we put down 3 cards, but a second lady came back to tell us we could only split between two max. On a side note, I recommend restaurants make that policy known ahead of time, which would save your waitstaff the trouble of having to make another trip to tell us.  You can be sure I'll return for the delicious eats. Again, the amount of attention to the flavors is lovely. I truly hope the community will give enough support that this yummy business will be able to hire more staff and improve efficiencies. Until then, I'll just come anticipating a leisurely meal.",

    "text": "We've been loyal patrons of coca cafe since it opened, however it's unlikely that we will ever return.   The only food that should be served on an ice cold plate is salad. Definitely nothing hot-breakfast related. No microwave? No heat lamps? No problem! There's this marvelous modern warming device called an oven, and if you place your serving plates in it, they'll be toasty warm and help keep the, what should be, warm breakfast food your customers expect to be served, warm from kitchen to table, no matter what the kitchen temperature.   Upon expecting a warm breakfast only to have it served on ice cold plates, I promptly requested my just-served ice cold over-medium eggs be immediately returned to the kitchen for some type of warming, only to get the wtf eyeroll from the waitress - yeah, I did see that. And I rarely, if ever send my food back. You all need some training on people skills!  The owner came out with a half-hearted apology about \"the kitchen fans make the kitchen air 50 degrees, which severely chills the plates...\" um, not an acceptable explanation or excuse or apology, frankly. It seemed more of an obligatory \"apology;\" one filled with contempt for the customer who was making a REASONABLE request for breakfast food to be warm. Moses, lady; I don't care that you've been in business for 12 years. If that is supposed to be some kind of testament to how good your restaurant is?...think again!  Lousy food, combined with mediocre customer skills and service will close your doors faster than you can utter the word \"boo!\"  Oh, yeah...did I mention that there were 3 other patrons in the restaurant and it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food...our ice cold, should-have-been-warm breakfast food!This was a Thursday, not a Sunday, as many reviews note the Sunday brunch debacle. With only 3 other patrons in the restaurant, it should not take 45 minutes to get a breakfast!  Not a \"coffee or toast on the house for our indifference to your ice-cold breakfast food, maam.\" Nothing but a contemptful \"apology.\"  Oy. What once was a good place to eat is now a shadow of what it once was. Go to Ritter's instead - less expensive and nicer people.  A HUGE disappointment.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to checking out the brunch at Coca Cafe for a long time, as many different friends in Pittsburgh have recommended it to me. Let's be honest, brunching is one of my favorite things to do...so of course I was eagerly anticipating the experience!  Coca Cafe is small, so be prepared to wait for your table. My friend and I came at around 1 PM on a Sunday and were told that our wait would be around 30 minutes for a table - honestly, not too bad at all. Coca is BYOB, so this gave us just enough time to hike up the hill to Arsenal Cider and grab a growler of pear cider before receiving the text that our table was ready.  My expectations were quite high coming into this brunch, as I had been told many times over that Coca has one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh. My overall experience was that I was impressed, but not as impressed as I had hoped I would be. The service was great; our waiter, Tristan, was attentive and friendly. We began with one of the starters: the buttermilk donut with lemon, blueberry, and blackberry icings and powdered sugar. Truthfully, this donut was the star of the show. The donut was crisp yet fluffy, and the icing combination was phenomenal. We gobbled it up immediately.  For the main course, I ordered the avocado omelette with applewood smoked bacon and house salsa. I was concerned about the jalapeno muenster as I don't love spicy things, so I subbed in the extra-aged beemster instead. My omelette was delicious. Was it the best omelette I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. However, it was quite tasty and quite large, so I was able to bring home leftovers. It also came with a side of grilled potatoes and a small fruit cup, which complimented it well.  I love that Coca changes their menu regularly, because this means that the next time I come I can be pleasantly surprised with something new. I'm not sure if it lived up to the hype for me on this first experience, but I can see myself coming back in the near future!",

When it came to divide up the check she could not get her point across that you can only spilt it with two cards. So 30 mins later. She finally rang us out. Just not a very pleasant atmosphere I was tapping my toe waiting until I could leave.",

I have a friend who told me before I visited Pittsburgh, that the brunch scene was up and coming, but this one stole the cake on trendiness.   After the long wait we were finally seated and were able to place our order. We got the friend eggplant Benedict and the goat cheese and mushroom grits. The Benedict was meh, but the grits blew me away! Everything about it was perfection from the poached eggs to the mushroom balsamic glaze.   I think this place has a few kinks to work out with service, but overall I enjoyed the food.",

Whatever problems there were in the past have been corrected. The service was great!   Every person that works there that I came in contact with were pleasent and made the experience fun. The food was amazing!  It's made fresh and portions are filling. If you're used to 15 minute lunches...go back to McDonald's!!!  Coca has a euro feel to its pace. It's not rushed at all. TIP if you want to avoid a wait try 1pm. I love this place and will return often.",

    "text": "Coca Cafe had been on my to-try list for years now, and I finally stopped by for brunch last Saturday with my girl friend. We arrived a little after noon and were told that the wait would be 45 minutes. I inwardly groaned when I learned that they used the No Wait app. If only I had known and had checked in!  We spent our wait time strolling around Lawrenceville on a (very unexpected!) pretty day in January. The wait was a bit longer than the 45 minute estimate - closer to an hour - and I was suspicious when I walked back into the restaurant and saw the same large table still open in the front dining room. Did they just not seat us (or anyone else) there because our parties were too small?  I started with a glass of orange juice. It was really quite delicious, but I was very disappointed in the glass size (6 or 8 oz maybe?) that cost $3.95. I expected a much larger glass of juice for that price.  I ordered the chicken and pancakes as it sounded like a nice balance between sweet and savory. The fried chicken was actually chicken thighs. The chicken was so greasy that I had a tough time even eating half of my serving and still felt a bit sick to my stomach for the rest of the day. The pancakes were descent but just too heavy. I expected a lighter, tastier pancake to be served by a place that specializes in breakfast/brunch.  Though I had a nice time with my friend, I just wasn't blown away by the food or beverage that I ordered. However, my friend ordered an omelet and cleaned her plate. Everything looked very fresh and delicious, and the side of breakfast potatoes were just perfectly cooked and seasoned. If I come to Coca again, I'll definitely be ordering an omelet.",

    "text": "I have intended to dine at Coca Cafe for brunch for at least 2-3 years because so many people said good things about this place. So my friend and I decided to just wake up early, arrive right when it opens, and try to beat the brunch crowd. We get there at about 9:20am and were told that there would be a 30-40 minute wait. Great. But we didn't come for nothing, so we put our name and number down and took a stroll down the street while we waited for our table.   On a typical day, I would have ordered a few other things on the menu before the one I actually ended up ordering: the eggplant benedict. I don't often like eggplant that much, so perhaps it is my fault that I didn't enjoy it, but in my defense, Coca Cafe seemed to be one of those places where everything would be good, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. I ended up just eating barely half of it and the potatoes and fruit.   Unfortunately, for me, Coca Cafe wasn't worth the wait.   Taste | 2 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 2.5",

It took a while to get coffee/espresso drinks, to order, then to get food, and finally to pay. I think we were there for over 2 hours, even though we had no wait to be seated and it wasn't crowded. Our waiter was working hard but he had to make all the drinks himself while waiting his tables, and I'm not sure what the other staff hanging around were supposed to be doing.   I still love the food, and it was a great place for BYO before because you could leisurely sip on your mimosas while waiting for service. Hopefully they make some changes to speed up service, because it doesn't do the food justice!",

Our server quickly gave us water and coffee but then didn't come back to take our order for 20 minutes. We sat with empty coffee cups, no refill of cream, or check in for another 30 minutes. After waiting for over an hour and listening to other tables complaining (while the staff was cleaning) I checked in with another member of the waitstaff bc our server couldn't be found to let him know we haven't received any food yet.  He proceeded to tell me that they were having \"issues in the kitchen\" and \"there are tears everywhere.\" Bottom line- very inappropriate and extremely unprofessional.

We are both on the vegetarian spectrum (although eat fish), and I was a little worried that their \"no substitutions\" menu might pose a problem. I didn't know that their menus changed so drastically! There are now VEGAN and VEGETARIAN options. My friend ordered the Challah french toast with brie, and I enjoyed a very filling avocado omelette (sans bacon). Both were fabulous!

It's definitely got a hipster vibe to the place, but not to the extreme that people over 30 feel out of place.  I own a nearby bed & breakfast and COCA is included in my short list for area eateries.  Their curried chicken salad is absolutely to die for, although I've never gotten a bad meal here.   I've not had one guest who didn't later rave about the food.  So why the four stars?  Service.  Last couple of times, even when they were not exceedingly busy, service was poor to fair.    Most recently, I went with my sister to Sunday brunch.  Maybe because there was a major thunderstorm going on outside, there was no wait and we got a table right away.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there is often a line out the door to get a table, especially for weekend brunch.  I ordered an avocado omelet, and my sister ordered a brunch special, scotch eggs  with grits.  We got our drinks right away, but waited over 30 minutes for our lunch.  While our server was uber helpful/attentive/flirty with the guy sitting adjacent to us, she was very good at ignoring us.  Just when I was about to get up to check on the food with someone other than our server, our food appeared.  But no silverware.  Another 5 minute wait for that.  And did I mention that they were not horribly busy?  I give COCA a 5 for their consistently good food (and our food that rainy day did not disappoint, it was wonderful), but service a 3.",

The eggs were poached perfectly and the eggplant was thinnly sliced and crispy. The ingredients married together very well.   We waited 40 minutes to be seated on a Saturday afternoon (1ish), which was to be expected. They will, however, take your telephone number and call you when your table is ready. This was appreciated, as we went down the street for coffee while we waited.   Ambiance is cute. We sat in the back (away from the door) and by the window. Would love to go back and try some other menu items like: pumpkin pancakes with ginger mascarpone cream and caramelized pears, OR the avocado omelete with apple smoked bacon, jalapeno muenster and salsa, OR the curry chicken salad with pecans, golden raisins, and mango chutney. There are SO many intriguing options.",

My Mahi Mahi tacos were rather successful and were comprised of grilled dolphinfish cubes, a fine, chunky guacamole, and a tangy red cabbage slaw all packed inside a generous trio of toasted tortillas that were garnished with a sort of remoulade. A crock of cheesy, re-fried black beans acted as a side dish, and I enjoyed them despite not usually going nutters over re-fried beans of any type.   It's worth noting that CC's menu changes often, and the tacos are not currently on the online menu, but do look for them if and when you go to CC.   P.S.

    "text": "My group met for brunch this morning at 11:00 am.  We had a server that identified herself as the \"front room manager\".  She treated us in the rudest, most appalling and unprofessional manner.  Our server had a surley attitude right from the start.  Apparently they were short-staffed. Water glasses were slammed on the table, with water spilling on the surface, which we just quietly cleaned up ourselves. At this time there were four empty tables in the room, but she wanted the twelve of us to crowd around a table for eight, then was visibly annoyed that three of the group sat at a nearby table. Meanwhile our leader had called ahead to the restaurant but there was no answering machine-just a message left by the restaurant. As our orders were served, people asked for ice in the water, the server replied they only had bags of ice as their machine was broken. I got up and asked another server who pleasantly got me ice for my iced tea and another person's water. This \"front room manager\" never asked us how our food was, never offered more drinks and just as I was about to cut into my food, she grabbed my plate and said it belonged to another table. Two of our guests had to ask for their side cups of fruit-and one guest never got her fruit at all. One check was delivered with a 20% tip hilariously included!!  Two of our group had to pay with a credit card which threw her into a tizzy. She kept insisting that two separate people paying with credit cards was against their policy. When she was asked for her name, she said,\" I have no name\" and proceeded to say she had never been treated so badly by a group. Oh, and she told two of our guests to leave the restaurant!!!!  Whoever the owner is, I hope you read this review and give some serious consideration as to whether you want this employee representing your restaurant!  We will never return and unfortunately,  I would predict your restaurant's business will continue to decline. Terrible experience!!  I would be ashamed if I owned this place",

Working at a company down the street from Coca Cafe I stopped at the convienence store for coffee and decided to try the restaurant adjacent to the parking lot. What a lucky break because this place is amazing. I do not normally do this but it was so good I ate there twice in the same week. I had a crazy polenta cake with shrimp, avacado, pic and fried eggs, It was dynamic.. The next visit I had a corn muffin waffle with blueberry compote and a mango cream sauce. The dining room is really cool with flea retro tables from the 50's and 60's cool tunes playing at just right levels. Great wait staff who are attentive knowledgable and first rate. The chef owners have focused a balance of food atmosphere and service to create a True winner. If you dont try this place you wont know what a hip and tasty eatery is. Great Job Coca Cafe I will go out of my way to eat there again, anytime Im in the pittsburgh area.",

    "text": "I've been to Coca Cafe for brunch several times and love it each time. Yes, the wait can be horrendous on the weekends (that's kind of the thing with brunch). I get that service can be rushed on weekends too, but haven't experienced too much trouble with brunch before. I think that the thing to do with brunch foods is not to go with your typical brunch fare like omelettes, but to get their more adventurous foods. I've always been happy with the hash, the pancakes, and other interesting, innovative dishes that they have.  But the real reason that I wanted to write this review was because I finally tried their dinner. I have been walking by for months thinking that I should really go for dinner, but always think about Coca as a brunch spot. One night my husband and I had a bottle of wine in tow to grab dinner at Picollo, but there was a wait for Picollo and I was starving. We decided to go with Coca since we had never tried their dinner and there was no wait.  Well, I can't believe I waited so long to try their dinner. This was phenomenal. First, the corkage fee was minimal, which I always appreciate. We started with the charcuterie plate, which was fantastic for the most part. I'm not a huge pate fan and this was no exception, but the other meats and cheeses were great. My husband ordered the miso cod with black rice and fried Japanese okra and I ordered the BBQ duck with scallion pancakes and salad. Both were amazing! Seriously, some of the better food that I've had in quite awhile. The duck was cooked perfectly, which is hard to do (and I\"m not even an huge duck fan). The scallion pancakes had a little too much batter in my opinion, but were still quite tasty. And the salad was excellent. The cod was phenomenal, truly the star of the meal. I think that it was even better than the black miso cod at Soba, which is saying something. The black rice was excellent, nutty and interesting flavored, and the fried okra was perfect (not too much batter). We saved room for a lemon cake with rhubarb compote and lemon curd, which was fantastic. It was a hot night otherwise I would have tried the doughnuts with salted caramel sauce, as those were tempting me from afar. All of this food was reasonably priced, with the whole meal coming to ~$50. Not bad for a tasty night out and leaving feeling full on great food!  The service was very nice, if not a bit odd. The two waitresses seemed to both be serving us and weren't always communicating. But that turned into more attention rather than less, so I was happy. And they were both quite nice without being invasive, so another bonus point. They may want to communicate a bit more about service, but no complaints over here.  All in all, don't forget about Coca for dinner. Brunch is great but I think they really get to flex their muscles in the dinner menu.",

    "text": "Noting other reviews have mentioned a wait, we arrived at 8:30AM on Mother's Day, well ahead of the 9AM opening time.  We were eventually seated when the doors opened around 9:10AM.  They had a special brunch menu for the holiday, which offered selections from two courses, as well as mimosa or Bloody Mary.  The website hadn't mentioned the special brunch menu, but although my mother doesn't drink, I didn't mind paying a little extra for a nice brunch.  We all figured she could just order a coffee.  When the waitress finally came for our drink orders around 9:25, my mother asked about the coffee. She was told that they weren't serving coffee, and she would have to select one of the alcoholic drinks.  We're patient people, so we accept this, my mother ordered an extra mimosa that my wife enjoyed, and we walked to the cafe up the street and brought her coffee back.  Our food orders were finally taken at 9:40AM, which was odd, but I assumed the rush of opening was hectic.  Unfortunately, that's when the waiting really began.  Our first course was not served until an hour later, at 10:40AM.  The second course didn't arrive until 11:15AM.  At no point did anyone mention that the food would be so delayed, although we started to guess based on the surrounding tables.    Remember, they weren't serving coffee for this brunch.  So we were stuck inside for nearly 3 hours, in the morning, without caffeine.  That's basically the final straw for me.   We ultimately missed a scheduled tour (I'd thought allocating 2.5 hours for brunch was sufficient), and our Mother's Day celebrations were greatly curtailed.  We mentioned this to our waitress, who was less than helpful.  Basically, she said sorry, it was bad for everyone, and she just had to keep smiling.  At no point did a manager make rounds apologizing for the situation, which was very apparently uniform throughout the restaurant.    The food was pretty good, but not outstanding.  A meal with courses that are served so haphazardly just isn't the same.  For $30 a plate, there are many, many, many wonderful restaurants in Pittsburgh to enjoy, and they'll serve you in timely and pleasant fashion.  We will obviously not be returning to Coca Cafe.",

Yay for finishing my first year of graduate school!  There is no atmosphere to Coca Cafe, which I would have expected from the hipster-ish menu.  It's what I would refer to as upscale Yinzer atmosphere.  The tables are too close together so people will continuously run into you, and there will be children screaming at the tops of their lungs while their parents ignore them.  However, there are some really unique food options and the servers are pleasant enough.  I ordered an omelette with pesto, tomatoes, and feta.  It was presented very prettily, and there was a cute orange slice to give it some more color.  I wouldn't order this again necessarily, as it was too salty for my taste.  I did enjoy it, but I would prefer to try something else next time.  My friend got shrimp grits, which she raved about.  Overall, I totally prefer Coca Cafe to Square Cafe is Regent Square, and I would say that is the closest equivalent.",

My mother and I called this cafe early to make sure there was room the woman on the phone replied yes and there would be a table waiting for us. We arrive ten minutes later to find that was clearly not the case. We put in our name and she put us on the wait list. Twenty minutes later we were seated we ordered right away seeing how busy it was. We had coffee and water that was never refilled and we waited another hour and a half and our food never came. Finally my mother asked if the food was ever coming out to which our waitress replied there are other people waiting for food. She walked away without asking if we needed anything. At this point I look around to realize that there is not a single table with food on it. People there before and the staff is pretty much standing around. Finally my mother walks up saying that she wishes to pay for coffee but we must leave. The woman replies \"can I just say that you haven't been waiting that long. No one else is being uptight\" To which then my dad says we are leaving and not paying for the coffee. The staff is appalling and the time we spent there was atrocious. The service was awful for mediocre, overpriced brunch food.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to grab some brunch at Coca Cafe on a Friday at 11pm. It had been over a year since my last visit, and I remembered from that experience that it had unique offerings and the kind of bustle that you want at your Saturday brunch spot.   On a Friday, you don't get the same \"bustle\" that you get on a Saturday. We were sat without a wait, and our waitress was quite quick to get us water and coffee. When she brought out the water, it was lukewarm. (Side note: the previous night I had just returned from a trip to China, where there is not a bottle of cold water in the entire country. Needless to say, I was used to water this temperature, but I missed ice cubes dearly. It could have been colder).   I ordered the green shakshuka and my friend ordered the eggplant Benedict. Last time I had been there, I also ordered the shakshuka, but the recipe had changed drastically. The food took a while to arrive at our table despite the emptiness of the restaurant. The shakshuka was the perfect portion size; however it was a tad overcooked. The egg yolks were quite hard, and the vegetables seemed to have a noticeable singed aftertaste and a thick, dry texture. Nonetheless, the sauce was herbaceous with an interesting, earthy flavor. I'd eat it again for sure while crossing my fingers and hoping its not overcooked. The potatoes on the side seemed slightly bland in my opinion, but I tend to enjoy things a bit spicier.   After we finished our meals, the waitress took a while to get us our check and, while the receipt reflected that I had spent more on my meal than my friend, she ended up charging our credit cards evenly.   Conclusion: food is unique and delicious despite being cooked inconsistently, and service is slow.",

    "text": "The best brunch place in Pittsburgh, hands down. Located in the super hipster Lawrenceville, this place is my go-to restaurant for a great start to the day. It has this cute diner vibe and is always packed with people. They don't take reservations for brunch - you can call and put your name on the list so its first come/call, first serve. But trust me, it is 110% worth the wait.  For your beverages, make sure you order one of their freshly squeezed juices. They make it in house and have such wonderful concoctions. I'm particularly fond of their pear honeydew pineapple juice. It is just the right level of sweet and tart. You'll have to stir it a bit occasionally for the consistency to be right. It is SO SO SO good though. I've also tried the matcha tea latte, which wasn't the best I've had. The matcha tasted a bit funky, and the latte itself wasn't made that well.  Anyway, on to the starters. Banana bread with honey walnut cream cheese and fruit? Amazing. Bread is wonderfully moist and soft - not stale at all and not too sweet. Avocado toast with a drizzle of honey? My favorite. Sounds like a strange combo but I promise you it just works.  Brunch menu always changes when I go, which makes it exciting. I've tried their pumpkin pancakes with maple butter and caramelized pears. The pancakes are so soft and you probably won't be able to finish them (HUGE portion size) . The pears were my favorite part. If you have a giant sweet tooth, this is your dish.  I've also had their scallop eggs benedict. It's not on their website menu since I guess it's a rotational one, but I loved it. I think it's my favorite brunch dish I've had there. The scallops were so large and juicy and went perfectly with the hollandaise sauce. Normally, with eggs benedict, restaurants kind of just give up on the English muffin part and it's just that - a plain English muffin. But they toasted it here and did something with it to make it stand out to me (I don't know what).  Another thing I've tried is their house cured and tea-smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, dill, and roasted tomatoes. The goat cheese threw me off at first (wasn't expecting it in an omelet, or with salmon), but it was surprisingly pretty good. This was your standard breakfast omelet with a twist.   Finally, I've also tried the savory duck crepe with Asian slaw and two sunny side up eggs. This dish was interesting. Slaw wasn't my favorite, but then again, I never like slaw. Eggs were fine. Duck was fine. I think it was just confusing to me in the way they presented the dish. They hid the crepe part on the bottom, covering it with the duck confit, slaw and eggs. I completely missed the crepe part until I ate through the dish and saw it, and by then, it was all soggy and unappealing. I wish they had presented it in a way where it preserved the integrity of the \"crepe,\" especially as they were calling it a crepe dish.   Otherwise, this place is truly a neighborhood gem. It's also a short walk from Espresso A Mano, a fantastic coffee shop. Smaller groups fare better here and be ready to wait at least 30 minutes if you come on a popular brunch day!",

We first ordered drinks, which took a little while to be served (10 minutes). Then came the wait. We waited for about 30+ minutes for the food to get onto the table, from the time of ordering. Basically we ate for around 15 minutes, and spent the rest of the time waiting. The other tables around us seemed to be waiting for a long time as well, so I guess it's just the norm at this spot.  As for the food, it was okay. I wouldn't come back here for lunch though given the wait times. We got three dishes - Korean beef salad, chopped chicken romaine salad, and the special pumpkin pancakes of the day. The beef salad was pretty good, a 4/5. The chicken salad was nothing special, a 3.5/5. The pumpkin pancakes were pretty good, a 4/5.  All in all, I'd give this place a 3.5. 3 for service, and 3.5 for food.",

What used to be a quaint eatery with friendly staff and amazing food has turned into a snobby, unwelcoming, poorly run establishment. Walking in on a weekend morning, it's generally busy. You put your name on a list and, if you're lucky, wait about 45 minutes to an hour. Get unlucky, and you might just be stuck with a wait time close to 2 hours. There is nowhere to wait, and you are sent half a mile down the street to the nearest coffee shop by a rude hostess who really couldn't care less about you.  This is just the beginning. The most recent time I have been here, I was met with another 30 minute wait- until the waitress even noticed we were there. No water, coffee, menus...nothing. For half an hour.  She finally found us, and did not apologize. In fact, my friends and I felt like we were bothering her by asking for drinks. We finally ordered, and waited AN HOUR for our french toast and eggs. When the food came it was soggy, not fresh, and frankly not of the quality I remember so fondly from a few years ago.  By the end, we wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of there and pretend we didn't just overpay for crappy food and a disappointing experience.",

    "text": "This place is super cute. The area in general is super cute.  Came here for breakfast with a friend and was splendidly surprised by the awesome atmosphere and eclectic decor. I got the tea smoked salmon, goat cheese omelette with potatoes. It was very yummy and the portions were good for the price. My friend got the avocado omelette which he really liked as well. It's a family friendly place.  There is ample parking nearby and they also have some outdoor seating. The line can be long, but they will call you when a table is available, which allows you to roam around while waiting.  Will def come by again.",

I would say the service leaves something to be desired as we walked up to the bar and were asked if we were on \"the list\". To which we confusedly responded no. The hostess/waitress then sat us at one of the many empty tables we were surrounded by. The only other thing I would say about the service is that we were left alone for a while which made brunch take a while longer than it needed to. Otherwise the food was great!",

Service is slow and no one checked on us--I got up three times to:  ask for water and more coffee, find out where our food was (waited almost an hour), and to get our bill.  They tried to make up for the endless waiting with a raspberry donut but that, too, tasted like oil and was dry.  Lots of other customers had the same problems.  I miss the old Coco...  Please get some additional kitchen staff and train your wait staff.  It's not like they are busy bringing out food!!",

    "text": "One visit, and I rarely say (well, never say) things like this about a place on one visit.  Our group of 4 was scheduled to go to Coca Cafe for about 3 weeks.  Arrived and reservations were perfect and wew set by a nice window seat for late afternoon St. Pat's day celebrations.  Place is immaculate, and oddly retro artsy.  A fun exploration visually, and with a walk around to the sunny back room area, one could see just how much space they had created in this small area for customers.  There is even an outdoor seating area (for later this spring).  BYOB but a very minimal PER TABLE corkage.  None of the rip off per bottle regardless of how small or large your party might be. The fact they do a PER TABLE corkage has now ruled out even experimenting with places that was a $5-7 per bottle...   Really?  Seated immediately; water to table; drinks very fast indeed.  We ordered a cheese plate sampler -- the goat cheese / blue cheese (forgot the name) was excellent.  Explanation of the range of cheeses professional. Slow, even pace of visits by the waitress -- no rush, no push, even as the place was filling up.  FYI -- when we left at 8, there was not a single seat available in the place.  As we were readying to go, there were two more groups ready for our table.  They are doing something right. But were not under any pressure to move and relax where we were.  None.    Brisket, Brisket, sake marinated Cod -- all perfectly done with extra care on the presentation.  Anyone can slop food on a plate but few groups know how to properly arrange it visually.  White China -- what else.  The Cod marinade was done exactly correctly.  Most fu-fu places cook the fish until it is unrecognizable -- this was done closer to the raw side, which is my favorite (specially if one has lived in Japan and understand a bit about actual fish that is not-flash frozen.  Double espresso was nice.  Wine service could not have been better.  As the cafe loaded up with so many people, the waitresses were becoming stretched, BUT, honestly had everyone under control.  Busing to/from tables gentile.  Kitchen staff filtered out as necessary to keep things moving.  This felt like a slow meal in Athens, Greece actually, or an off broadway bistro in NYC. On a slower night we probably would have stayed another hour and chatted more.   Menu was 14\" long and narrow.  With fresh paper for each.  None of crap recycle plastic over paper one finds so often. We were tempted for dessert but the meal was ample.  Next time, we will start with desserts...  Prices were very reasonable for the quality of experience.    A dozen (yes) people came by carrying their bottles of wine and looked in the window to realize it was full, then moved on.  Noses pressed to the glass type of looking in...   We are interested in a repeat visit for the breakfast and brunch, then a visit to the strip district perhaps.    Some reviews from a year ago have \"issues.\"  I didn't see a single issue last night worthy of any comment.  I wish Coca Cafe had a place up in the Cranberry area which is apparently the \"good food desert\" for western PA.  f8 and be there.",

    "text": "SETTING Clean interior with tables positioned close together in a tight space. Loud chatter and background noise during a Sunday brunch.  FOOD Unique and tasty brunch offerings, which is the main reason I like this spot. Pancakes and waffles are delicious and all, but occasionally my taste buds crave something more exotic. Coca Cafe does the job right.   I've always gotten the Fried Eggplant Benedict. If this is your first time here, get this now and thank me later. Not a huge fan of eggplant? Don't worry, it doesn't have an overwhelming taste. Two servings of fried eggplant and poached eggs on top of its own english muffin, topped with roasted tomatoes and doused in--wait for it--BASIL hollandaise sauce. Tasted a bit like pesto mixed in with hollandaise sauce, and let me tell you, it was heavenly.  This time I ventured out and tried a new dish. The Smoked salmon omelet was solid, but it felt like something was missing...maybe some sort of sauce would have taken it to a new level. Along with bits of salmon, the omelet also had a generous amount of goat cheese, a bit of dill, and a few sliced baby tomatoes inside. I'm pretty sure it was a typo on the menu because instead of \"smoked\" salmon, it was \"cooked\" salmon. Still good, but it wasn't what was advertised. If it had some sort of sauce to add to the texture and provide a sort of moistness, I think it could become a very good dish. For now, I'll stick with the Eggplant Benedict.  SERVICE I've never waited so long (on premise) for food before. Put our phone number down and was told 1 hour 15 min. After waiting the full length of time, we went back to check on our status. Apparently they wrote down the wrong phone number or something since they claimed they called but we never got it. After finally being seated, it took another 20 or so minutes to get our food. Total time we waited from putting down our name to food on table was 2 hours!!! NOT COOL. The atmosphere seemed kinda of hectic. Lots of movement, loud chatter from other nearby tables, and long waits. This is probably the main reason I don't come that much, but if I do, I go right when they open.   IMPRESSIONS At first thought, \"adventurous\" and \"comfort food\" don't seem to go together, but neither do Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna. I was wrong, on both counts!    You know a certain dish like the Fried Eggplant Benedict is special when you only associate it with the one restaurant, and you can't seem to muster the courage to order something else every time you visit. Just make sure you come early. Or you might be waiting 2 hours :(",

Right up front, *enormous* bonus points for the best restaurant website I've seen in months; the front page has address and hours in easy to find, clear text.  (Is that so much to ask of all the other restaurants around?)  They had every table full on a friday at noon, but no wait, which was good.  Definitely seemed like a place best well-timed; avoid busier times of the day, I think.  Service was very friendly, and a hair slow due to the full restaurant.  That said, the white omelette was good, as was the brie-stuffed french toast.  Both could have used a touch more cheese, maybe; not sure if anyone else would agree, as I really love some cheese.  Cinnamon bread was surprisingly understated and awesome.  The art on the walls was actually first-class, which was more than a little surprising to me.  I'll head back soon.",

It's crowded and in good weather, the line waiting snakes round the corner of the street.  In the winter, waiting patrons sometimes awkwardly stand in between tables hovering over those already seated.  If you do get here early enough to score a table in the back somewhere, it's great, even for families!  So, I'm not here to write another review about that.  I just wanted to say they do GREAT carry-out catering too so think about ordering that way if you live nearby.  I needed to put together a weekend brunch at home in a hurry, left things to the last minute, and on Saturday afternoon, had an \"Oh s#!t!\" moment when I realized.  I called them and asked if they did catering, which they said they did.  They got someone knowledgeable on the line to take my order, helped me put together a few selections based on my favorites on the menu with alterations that would allow transport and heat well.  It was done and packed up at precisely the time I asked for it at their busiest time on Sunday, no less (11AM) and I was out the door and able to have my successful brunch at home!",

    "text": "Food-wise Pittsburgh could really do no wrong during my recent weekend trip and Coca Cafe was the perfect way to end the time I spent there.   My boyfriend and I drove up to see a line of people waiting to be seated as the place opened up for business on Sunday morning. We ended up heading over to Espresso a Mano to wait for 30 minutes until a table freed up. The staff called us right on schedule and was extremely friendly.  The decor is cute and eccentric. Exposed brick, art on the walls, mis-matched furniture, all very cute and welcoming.  Our service was a little spotty, the girl forgot a few things and seemed distracted but the food made up for that.   I had the goat cheese and red pepper polenta cakes with poached eggs. The eggs and the grilled potatoes that came with were perfection. The polenta cakes were a tad too rich though. I wanted them to have a bit more solidity. They were so rich, in fact, that I could only eat one. I also got a side of bacon and let me tell you it was the BEST BACON I have EVER HAD! I could have had just that and been happy.  My bf ordered the black bean and andoullie sausage hash and it was incredible..it made me wish I had ordered that. His buttermilk biscuit, however, was a tad bland.   Over all it was a delicious meal and I'm a little sad I didn't get to try their sweeter menu items. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh this place will be on my repeat stop list!",

First off, CALL IN TO RESERVE a spot on the list because the line can get very long (most of us who just went there hadto wait an hour). They do tell us that there is a coffee shop three blocks down (and a Dozens cupcake further down too), but the wait is very long!  Upon seated, the waitress made us feel very appreciated and thanked us for the wait. It was around 12:50pm then. I ordered the roasted vegetable omelette and the boyfriend ordered french toast sandwich. Both were delicious. I'm a big fan of omelettes so I was super excited when it came. The cheese and the veggies together - yum! If you have a big appetite on sundays you can also order the side of a croissant - it was DELICIOUS, worth every penny!   Lots of on street parking too.

Surprisingly it was still packed then and couldn't fit our party of 5 for another 20 minutes. There's no waiting room so they told us to wait at a nearby coffee shop but instead of trying to find it, we went back to our car and hung out until we received a call from them letting us know our table was ready.  If you're going for a juice, I'd recommend the carrot ginger but the carrot ginger orange is just a bit much. The applewood smoked bacon is a must try, I just love how it had a crisp apple taste to it.  I ordered the mushroom omelette while my friend ordered the salmon omelette so we can share and try both. The salmon omelette had a nice lavish layer of lox right on the underside of the eggs and highly recommend for salmon lovers. The mushroom omelette is also a great choice for vegetarians and non alike.   Overall good experience and I spent just ~$15 for an omelette, side of bacon and juice.",

    "text": "I have been to this place a half dozen times, but always for the brunch, which was quite good. The odd thing happened yesterday when we wandered in at around 4:30 which seemed to be in the twilight time between lunch and dinner. The serving staff seemed quite taken aback that we dared venture in during  this period of down time (which I'm sure they deserve) between official dining hours. The issue here however, is the cold rudeness they displayed at my inquiry about the times of dining. I know I am an unpleasant and disturbing sight at the best of times, but they looked at me like I was asking for a comped meal for Bill Cosby. The only salvation was that the young lady mopping the floor flapped the strands of mop across my shoes, affording me a decent shine (admittedly, I did walk in her path). I am old and decrepit. Maybe I'm too old and ancient for hip venues like this. But, I am the most outrageously generous tipper on earth. In the universe. My mom worked hard in food service and catering for meager recompense. I make up for that. I won't darken their emo doorway again.",

The tomato jam was amazing - seriously. The eggs were way less done than I prefer, but I didn't make any special requests when ordering so I'll let that one slide. I can understand why they have a line out the door for weekend brunch! I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I've been to Coca Cafe for a total of four times.   I ordered the challah French toast with melted Brie and fig jam and fresh mixed berries the first time. I loved the marble tables in the back of the restaurant - it added to the aesthetic of the picture and the dish. I'm not a big fan of Brie but the taste wasn't too strong which was good.   The second time I went, I ordered the grilled shrimp and aged cheddar grits with poached eggs. I love grits but I wasn't sure how it would taste with cheddar cheese. It was a bit heavy and thick in my opinion so the grilled shrimp evened it out a bit but I don't think I'd get it again. I also ordered the almond coca mocha and it was sooo amazing! I would order it in the future again.    And the third time, I ordered the shakshuka with eggs baked in spicy tomato sauce in an iron skillet with pita bread, potatoes, and fresh fruit on the side. This was an interesting dish because I've never had anything like this before. I definitely recommend dipping the pita bread with the eggs and tomato sauce because just eating the tomato sauce itself is a bit boring and doesn't seem like you're eating a meal. The flavor of the dish was a bit foreign to me in that there seemed to be a lot of spices but overall it was a good new experience.   I tried something new this time: the Fried Eggplant Benedict! I think as I'm aging, I'm growing to love all different kinds of veggies so I went with the eggplant. It came with poached eggs with roasted cherry tomatoes on top, covered by basil hollandaise. And the English muffins under all of that. I was scared that the hollandaise would be too much for me but I really really enjoyed it. I liked the different textures of the fried eggplant, the poached eggs, and the roasted tomatoes.   A bit of a warning though, the space inside is not too big so it can get crowded and loud during its busy hours. It's a popular breakfast/brunch place so I would say that for the weekends, you'd need to go in early to be seated quickly. Otherwise, the service is nice and friendly.",

    "text": "Oh how I used to look forward to eating breakfast at Coca Cafe.  Times sure have changed!  A few weeks ago, I stopped in with my wife for breakfast.  It was a busy Saturday am and we were prepared for the wait.  Immediately, we met the hostess and put our names in and accepted the 30-40 minute wait.  At 40 minutes, we came back to inquire and was told it should only be a few more minutes.  No problem we thought.  20 min later we were seated in the outside patio.  Roughly 15 minutes went by and we were greeted by a server who clearly seemed to be frazzled.  She delivered water and menus and waited a further 15 minutes to take our order.  After 30 minutes went by with no contact or refills of drinks, we just got up and left.  Ugh!  I really was looking forward to an amazing meal.  Just 2 days ago, we stopped in again to give them another shot.  This time, we arrived just as they were opening for the day (Saturday).  Immediately, we were seated and given menus.  So far so good!  Wife's water glass had a bit of food on it..oh well we thought, these things happen.  After placing our order my wife used the restroom and said the sink had paper towel in it and the floor was filthy.  As she's telling me this, we both take a look at the floor of the eating area which was in really filthy.  Silverware on the floor, dirt etc.  The place had JUST opened for the day!    We used to love stopping in for a uniquely prepared meal and have told a lot of people how much we loved the place.  Now with today's options in PGH, it's going to be hard to convince me to ever go again.",

    "text": "I have been here 6 times in the past 3 years, and every time its unfortunately a little worse.    Positives: This time I came with my 2 kids and had checked in online so we had no wait for saturday at 11:45am.  they had booster seats which were fine for a 4 year old and 21 month old.  They have adultish pictures for coloring with colored pencils but lots of little games and such available you can grab from the shelves to entertain young and old.  2/3 wait staff were friendly .  good veggie options.  the homemade salsa on my dish was excellent.  the vibe and decor is kinda funky and fun  Negatives: there really weren't brunch options, the only thing on the menu was breakfast food.  When I came in the past there were definitely more lunch/brunch options. Had come to get the chicken fingers for my daughters, because i remember they were huge and a great value for the price...not available.  the sides were overpriced for what they were and compared to the past.  When I got the brown sugar bacon before it was a hefty pile, this time it was literally 3 pieces of bacon for $6.  The avocado toast was untoasted thin bread spread thinly with mashed avocado and nothing on top, so the bread was almost mushy.  def not worth it.  I got the eggs and grits which was a generous portion, but the grits were too watery, and the cheese was nonexistant.  the 3 chips put in were soggy as a result, and the eggs were flat clumps (\"scrambled\") There is one large front door, so every time someone enters or exits there is a massive freezing breeze that hits the whole front dining area.  Its really awful.    for 2 mains, 1 kids french toast, 2 sides as above, 2 coffees and 3 club sodas, it was $72 which to me is pretty brutal and unaffordable.   alas don't think we will be back",

Now that I've moved North, a broken grill at Pamela's forced my hand and I stopped here for breakfast today.  When we arrived there wasn't a list but the only available seats were at the counter. You would've thought that meant quicker service but we were here for over an hour and rarely had a refill to our coffee.  As far as the food went: the donut was good, nothing special but it was covered with a nice blackberry sauce. My wife ordered a homemade juice that she enjoyed but I found the coffee to be bland. For our main course, I went with eggs Benedict which unfortunately came out warm at best. The flavor was fine, but I didn't like the homemade hollandaise as it was too sweet. My wife enjoyed her mushroom omelette which did come out hot.  The staff was friendly but clearly a little stressed out. Our waitress in particular was a little bit short with some of the staff and customers.  Glad to finally make it here, but probably won't be back any time soon.",

I walked to the front and said I had to go. I was informed my food was ready...I replied that I still had to go. They shoved it in a box and didn't give me utensils to eat. I told the miserable woman waiting on me that I appreciate attitude and I was told that I was the one with an attitude. I'll never go back...many other far superior places to go.

The ambiance of the restaurant is quirky and artsy. I really liked the decor and the coloring sheets on the table are a fun addition too! As for the food, I ordered the coca cafe sandwich while my boyfriend got the salmon eggs Benedict (after a mixup with the crab Benedict). My sandwich was really yummy and a very unique take on a breakfast sandwich! I also really liked the hollandaise sauce on the Benedict as well.   I will say that their service was rather slow, even though we were one of four tables in the entire restaurant. Also, the back room was so cold that we had to switch out to the front room. I could see how both these things could be a bigger issue when the restaurant is filled for weekend brunch. Still, give this place a try, during the week if you can!",

We had a table of 5 and waited nearly 90 minutes for our food after we ordered. It sucked that after seeing two tables come in after us, order, and get their food before us (3-4 people per table) we had to ask the waitress the status of our food. She checked for us (about 1 hour after ordering) and only said that our ticket was next.  After receiving our food, I found a hair on the bowl that had my side of fruit in it. I asked for the sever if it could be replaced and he didn't exactly listen as he came back moments later with the same bowl (hair still visible) but with new fruit instead. Asked a different waitress instead to replace the bowl.   The food is good but I'll just stick to Pamela's or Deluca's for breakfast from now on.",

Unfortunately had a terrible experience, which heavily skewed the review. Waited 38 minutes between ordering and getting plated. The beef in the bimbapbap was actually inedible. I had to remove it from the dish, basically paying $15 for a rice bowl. It was not busy but we were forgotten about with no water or coffee refills. Then when asking for a box, they threw out the only meal worthy of boxing to go. They graciously didn't charge for the 2 coffees...  That said, I'll still continue to visit and patronize them.

    "text": "Having just relocated to Pittsburgh from NYC, I was on a mission to find great brunch places in my neighborhood of Lawrenceville and Coca Cafe did not disappoint.  It was a rainy Saturday- I was greeted and seated right away by Stephanie. She was so nice and so attentive, offering suggestions and conversation with patrons.  I appreciated this.  I ordered the challah French toast with a side of well done bacon and I would certainly recommend both! Iced coffee was great too. Stephanie did inform me that they do have a small bit of outdoor seating in the back that tends to fill up on nicer days.  They allow you to bring your dog but she did mention it would be best to call ahead to see how full their seating is before coming. I will certainly be back to try other menu items and enjoy their outdoor seating! Oh, and I love the Billie Holiday selections that were playing on the speakers! So perfect for a rainy Saturday. :)",

    "text": "I came here on a Wednesday afternoon for brunch. The first thing I noticed was that the cups were very dirty. They were greasy, had fingerprints on them, and were grimy on the inside and out. My cup of water had things inside and my friend's cup of water wasn't even clear. It was opaque!  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was supposed to be on challah but it came out on brioche. And my side salad came with tomatoes on it even though I had told the waitress of my nut and tomato allergy. But at this point, service seemed weird enough and I just decided to ignore these things and not eat my side salad.   We sat outside and noticed a dog there. It was apparently one of the owners' or waitress' dog. They left the dog out by the tables on a leash but the dog could still reach my friend's purse. Additionally, the waitresses would come out to adjust the dog's collar, pet him, and check up on him and I'm not sure if they ever washed their hands in between handling our plates and the dog.   At one point my friend asked for an extra napkin and the waitress asked if I was using mine and told my friend to just use my napkin. Again, nothing blatantly wrong with this. Just strange. And then the waitress added that she of course could get us a new napkin if we REALLY wanted one.   Then finally when the check came, our waitress forgot who had ordered what, even though we were one of maybe 3 parties left in the entire restaurant. And when the waitress came back with the check and my credit card, she didn't give me a pen to sign with and never came to check on us again, so I just signed with my finger nail.  Overall, poor and just very strange service. Food was maybe a 2.5/5. Neither me nor my friend enjoyed our sandwiches very much. Would not try this place again.",

    "text": "Most brunch places are not worth waiting in a 45 minute line, Coca Cafe is not one of those. It's neither an over the top foodie brunch destination nor a generic Yinzer diner, it's the perfect mix of a creative menu, charming environment, and portions won't make you feel like a loaf the rest of the day.   My friend and I put our name in and while we waited we conveniently grabbed a coffee at Espresso a Mano down the block. We asked if we could sit at the bar, so we were able to be seated much quicker. Coca Cafe does have a full espresso bar and JUICE bar for any one like me who loves kale cucumber green apple celery ginger lemon juices. And for those who want their mimosa fix, it's BYOB.  We split the wild mushroom omelette and the sweet special, Captain Crunch Coated Stuffed Challah French Toast (yes, a mouthful). I'm not someone who can order only a sweet item, but splitting it was just enough.  If their lunch/dinner is anything like their brunch, I can't wait to check it out",

The reception and service though, are just pretty awful. First of all, we were asked to look on our phones for the menus on their Facebook page because they couldn't get them printed in time. Really? Couldn't even write them down on the chalkboard? Now I have to use my data to look up your menu in your restaurant? Then, you have to literally chase someone down to get any kind of attention, from checking in to getting refills for water or coffee. Even trying to get the check was a process. After a while I was so tired of waiting I just got up to the counter to get charged so we could just finally LEAVE. Oh, and 40 some people for ONE bathroom.   Food was alright. My shakshuka was good but my boyfriend's omelette was just...an omelette. Definitely not worth the wait, which was at least 40 minutes.   I've been here some 3 times now, and don't think I'm going to subject myself to this nonsense again. Spare yourselves the same and find somewhere else, where the staff will maybe care at least a little bit.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch on a Sun. in Dec. of last year based on Yelp reviews when I was unable to get a reservation for the famed Meat and Potatoes brunch.  My dining partner and I walked in and were able to get seated right away at the counter.  This arrangement proved to be a bit uncomfortable, since the waitstaff often had to slide by to serve the adjacent tables, but it was preferable to waiting half an hour for a table, since I had to catch the Megabus at a certain time to head home for the holidays.  Based on yelpers' recommendations, I decided to try the herbed goat cheese French toast, and it didn't disappoint.  It was definitely one of the most unique brunch items I've ever had!  I really enjoyed the contrast of the savory herbed goat cheese filling and the sweetness of the toast and syrup.  I don't recall what my dining partner ordered, but he enjoyed his dish, as well.  We ordered a side of bacon to share, and it was nice and crispy and slightly greasy--just the way I like it--and complemented the entrees well.  If you're looking for a place with an innovative brunch menu in PGH, this place is a good alternative to M & P.  Service was generally decent, esp. given how busy the place was, although our server did warn us that, given the seating arrangement, if other servers couldn't get by, they'd have to move us.  (This didn't turn out to be an issue, however.)  I appreciate their willingness to accommodate us, esp. given my tight schedule.  Note: Though they don't accept reservations, you can call ahead to be placed on the wait list before you arrive.  This is definitely an interesting spot to people watch--I spotted some pretty interestingly dressed hipsters waiting for a seat on my way out.  4.5 stars.",

I also thought the Grilled Cheese was very good. The prices are a bit high for some items, but it's in keeping with other small business establishments of similar style.  My biggest issue with Coca Cafe, and which keeps it from being a 4 star for me, is that it seems a bit pretentious. I've been twice, and both times when I ask questions about items on the menu the server has acted like I was silly for asking what something was. As if I didn't belong there if I had to ask. The service is just friendly enough, and seems like they say hello and welcome me to the restaurant only because they have to. I don't sense any genuine interest or care from their wait staff.  Overall, it's a good place to eat, but not my favorite because of the customer service.",

When we got in a server asked us if we had put our name in, which we had, and the couple next to us had as well. Immediately after, the host yelled from the coffee bar that there were two names ahead of us, and we needed to wait outside. The other couple and us left, and we walked across the street to Franktuary. Being told to wait outside in 35 degree weather is absolutely ridiculous! Thank goodness we decided to go somewhere else because we did not get notified that our table was ready until 50 minutes after we put our name in! I can imagine waiting outside during the summer, but really. The attitude of the workers was absurd. Franktuary was wonderful and a much better choice than Coca Cafe.

On this most recent visit, I ordered the shredded kale salad with local chicken, cranberries, pepitas, apple, and pomegranate dressing AND PICKLED GINGER! What? I need to remember that I love pickled ginger, and why shouldn't it go on a salad?! It was delicious! There was also a hint of cinnamon that I couldn't place. It could have been the dressing, but my memory made it taste like it was on the apples, sort of like apples that were just tossed and ready to go in a pie. Yum!  The coffee was fresh and roasty. I would have tried the chocolate donut holes with sea salted caramel, but a girl's gotta watch.   Bravo, AGAIN, Coco Cafe!",

We let the woman who sat the table know that we in fact were waiting in line first, to which she replied \"well, I cannot make them get up.\"  That wasn't our intent, and we had no problem waiting.  We then were seated in an outside table which was totally fine for us.  We were talking and looking over the menu, and when the woman who sat us came outside to seat another table, my friend politely asked if there was the breakfast quiche bowl on the menu anymore.  It was her favorite dish.  The woman, said with a shortness to her voice, that it was a new menu.  Once again,  no big deal.  We proceeded to wait another 10 minutes or so (which I stress wasn't a big deal since we were talking and catching up.)  The woman who sat us came outside again and we politely asked if the server knew we were out there.  My friend and I are both servers so we know how hectic it can be.  The woman replied \"Yes\" in a short tone again, and then when my friend looked at me and said, \"wow, that was kind of rude\" after the woman had walked away.  She then walked up to the table to inform us that she was in fact the owner, and didn't actually need our business!  We looked at each other and were so taken back by her sudden outburst! Especially when we had been polite and patient the whole time, and generally being very understanding.  Needless to say, we left.

    "text": "I've been here a couple times in the past year and a half, and I always mean to go back but keep forgetting it exists.  I try to avoid the brunch rush when I go, it's definitely doable!  The front has a nice coffeehouse vibe to it, but there are a few tables nestled in a narrow area out back, and this is where I've always ended up seated.  It's not especially well-decorated back there, but it's cozy.    Although there are a lot of tempting things on the menu, I always opt for the curried chicken salad sandwich.  Maybe one of these days I'll branch out and try something else, but that sandwich is way too delicious to pass up!",

    "text": "I went with a friend the other day and was really happy.  It's affordable (I hate the term cheap) and excellent.    I had the black bean burger and a cup of asparagus and mushroom soup.  It might have been the best soup I've ever had and the black bean burger was completely different than any that I've had before. I think it had something extra like fava beans to give it better texture and flavor.  My friend had the salmon burger which was also amazing (stole a bite).  I think our total with both sandwiches and two excellent cups of coffee with soy creamer (yay!) was about $20.",

    "text": "Love the ambiance of this cafe in Lawrenceville, located very close to Piccolo Forno and the 40th street bridge.  I had heard great things about the restaurant and was excited to try it out.    The place is packed and with a lengthy waitlist on Sunday mornings.  We got there and had our name on the list by 10:45 am and still had to wait about an hour to get seated.  And then, getting our meals took a long time also.  I actually went with the server's suggestion and got a special (smoked salmon frittata) - not the best, it turns out.  The frittata was especially dense and nothing to write home about and it came with 2 small pieces of smoked salmon on top.  Hmmm.  The french toast and sage ham meals that I saw looked good, and probably would be my choice the next time.  Later, I heard that avoiding the specials and sticking to the basics of the menu is usually your best bet.    Price-wise, it's about on par with other brunch locations in the city.  While a bit more inconvenient with respect to the wait and location, I am sure I will be back here for the different menu options and the charm of the cafe.",

    "text": "I heard so much hype about this place, I was seriously put off and hesitant to try it. I heard that the vegetarian and vegan options were slim. Plus, the hours are a little early for me, and I just kept missing them. One morning though, pressed to find a vegetarian/vegan brunch in Lawrenceville for a spontaneous brunch date, we sidled up to Coca to be surprised and delighted.   The wait for a table was less than 5 minutes, even though every table appeared full and it was a Sunday morning at prime brunch hour. Maybe they conjured it up. The space is darling - ground-level store front on Lawrenceville's main drag, bright colors, precious art, so squeaky clean, a well-maintained antique feel. The table service was provided by a series of remarkable people -- they were all quick, inoffensive, practically invisible, but helpful & attentive. I literally cannot remember the last time I paid less than $20 for a meal and felt pampered.   Ordering from the menu, I felt the vegan options were a little sparse, but a vegetarian could have their pick of choices.   And then the food arrived! Everything we ordered was scrumptious. Not in the \"satisfactorily good\" sort of way -- but actually, each bite was a surprising delight. I expected a passable veggie-friendly brunch on a moment's notice, but I was amazed by what actually happened. Tucked into a tiny booth in a back, bright yellow room, my brunch buddy & I marveled at perfect fluffy asparagus omelettes (hers) and a southwest-inspired tofu veggie pico scramble wrapped in a warm tortilla. The tofu scramble was, perhaps, a low spot in the meal. It was good, but I have been spoiled by the finger-lickin' tofu scrambles at other sites.   When we left, after stand-up drip coffee and pleasant conversation, we were pleasurably stuffed. My brunch date remarked on what a nice place, what a great neighborhood, and how smart of me to chose such a great spot! This is the mark of a quality dining experience - to elevate yourself & your neighborhood's value in the eyes of a visitor.   Coca, what a pleasant surprise!",

Yes, they are crowded on the weekend, but so is every other popular brunch spot in the city. Tip: call ahead before you leave your house to put your name on the list. Then, as someone else mentioned, you're free to wander Butler Street until they call your cell!  I recommend the challah french toast, goat cheese french toast, sundried tomato omelette, and all of the specials. Yesterday I had cornmeal waffles with pomegranate reduction and pineapple curd... yum!",

After visiting some shops we returned to wait the last half hour out front as to not miss our table. We noticed the hostess was coming outside and calling some names so we figured we were safe. Went inside after close to 2 hours of waiting and she had given away our table because we did not hear the phone ring. I realize this was a little on us for not hearing the phone but to not even come outside and double check was just rude. We got a table 5 min later. I asked the hostess to speak with a manager because she was being very rude. She informed me that she was the owner. I expressed my disappointment with the situation and she informed me that is the way it has been for the 11 years she owned it and that it has worked this long. The waitress then came over and was very nice and informed us that there were over 5 changes to the menu because at this time of the day they normally run out of food on an already short menu. The waitress, bus staff, and chefs get 5 stars because they were awesome but the owner's attitude and they way she runs a restaurant is just not acceptable. I strongly urge you find another place to eat brunch.  There are too many other great places in this city.",

This was one of the best dinners I've had in a really long time. We ordered almost of every appetizer and loved. My favorite was the pickeled deviled eggs. I did not know eggs could be this good- in fact, in the middle of dinner we ordered more of the eggs because we couldn't stop talking about them. ( This has also set high expectations for deviled eggs in other establishments as I sadly discovered dining elsewhere) Frankly, I coud have had them for dessert too. I had a lovely fish (bass?) served with shitake mushrooms in a light, incredibly flavorful broth. If I could have, I would have licked the bowl. I left nothing behind which is not usually the case. My friend ordered the same dish. We both agreed this was one of the best fish dishes I've ever eaten. We ordered the desserts- one of everything to share. These too were wonderful, not gooey or super sweet just really well conceived. The bill was the final surprise, as it's BYOB, our charge per couple was about $60. Had it been double, I still would have been okay with it because it was such a memorable meal. Would definitely go back- I think dinner here is a hidden gem.",

    "text": "We stopped by Coca Cafe for brunch at 11:30 on Saturday. I had no idea this place was so popular! We had to wiat 20-25 minutes for a small table for three which was really a table for two that they added a chair to in the middle of the aisle. Surprisingly, it was rather quiet for how many people were crammed into such a small space. I decided to get breakfast and looked for a carb heavy option which landed me on the pumpkin pancakes with ginger marscapone and pears. I also added a side of apple smoked bacon. The pancakes were a bit heavy for my taste. In my opinion, the best pancakes are light and fluffy. These pancakes could have been used as paper weights. Very thick and hearty. Not what I was expecting but still delicious. I only wish there was a little more marscapone and pears to even out the heaviness of the pancakes.  The bacon was phenomenal with small chunks of apples. I almost cried when I accidently knocked the bacon off the small table and onto the floor/vent. (If you're sitting in the back and you catch a waft of  bacon coming out of the vent, you're welcome!) When I asked for another order, I was fully ready to pay but to my surprise, they didn't change me. Overall, this seems like a great place for brunch. The menu was huge and had a wide variety of options.",

Ugh.  Also very surprised to hear a mgr. admit that they consistently have a problem with losing and keeping track of food tickets.  Won't be chancing this place again.

    "text": "I wish you could do a star rating with a caveat. So this is my caveat.  I went with two friends and a baby to brunch here in January. I am a breakfast fiend, and will try to eat it for every meal, and though we have our usuals, we decided to find a place at random and give it a shot. Enter Coca Cafe. Of course, I yelped it before we entered, just for a heads up, but we were going anyway.  Quick story: food was AMAZING, service was eh, staff was just not so nice.  We got there around 12:30, expecting a wait. It looked packed, so I went in alone while my other two friends and her baby waited outside. The sign (I can't remember if it was on the door or on a post as soon as you got in) said to sign in. The usual. There was no hostess stand so I waded through a couple tables to get to the register. There were four ladies behind the counter, milling about at the register and in making smoothies, doing what they do. And I stood there smiling. So maybe 30 seconds passed (but really, anything more than an immediate acknowledgement, even if it's just a 'I'll be right with you' seems long to me) and then I finally said, 'Uh, hi, do I need to put my name down for a table?' The girl at the register just said, without looking at me, 'Yeah, put your name and number down' and pushed a piece of blank computer paper across the counter at me. Okay. Wrote that down. Seemed weird that it wasn't official looking. Kinda worried about eating now. 'So is that all?' She said 'Yeah, and it looks like maybe 45 minutes to an hour for four.' Okay.  So I walked out and we shopped around.  Around 40 minutes later, we went back. My other friend popped in to check on the status. They said 15-20 minutes. So we waited. A waitress then popped her head outside and called my name. I guess this is a good time to say that there's no waiting room inside - so if it's cold outside and there's a wait, it's probably not worth it. Luckily, it was a warm day and definitely more bearable with the cute boutiques around. Anyway - back to this. She called our name, we gathered up our stuff, and filed in. She had already left the door, so we stepped inside and stood there awkwardly for a second or two before calling across the restaurant (which is small, so it wasn't that disruptive), 'Is this our table?' and pointing to an empty table. The one who had poked her head out the door was behind the counter and said, ' Yeah.' Okay, that's strange. Normally you show people where they're sitting.  I know we had more stuff than the quick pick-up with the baby in tow, but we weren't holding up for more than two minutes. We were starving.  So we sat down. A different girl popped over and said, 'Oh, you only have three people and a baby.' To which we said, 'Yes.' And she left. Strange. The same girl then came back and asked what we wanted to drink. Two of us ordered smoothies and the third order a chai tea latte (Around $3 or $4 each). We waited a bit (but were poring over the menu so it wasn't bad) then a different waiter came and had my friend re-order her smoothie (they were out of mango). No big. He then brought out our drinks. The smoothies were fabulous. Thick and fruity and so good. We each ordered something different so as to try bites. I don't remember the food coming quick or slow (and if I thought slow it was only because I was starving) so I'd say the service was average.   The food. was. AMAZING. I had the almond french toast with a lemon sauce and strawberries and blueberries, one friend had the lemon pancakes, and the other had an egg white omelet with goat cheese, spinach, and grape tomatoes and a croissant. Seriously amazing. The bread was the good baguette-style stuff, not the stuff from the sliced square loaf, the fruit was fresh and firm, and the taste was just phenomenal. We loved every bite of our own and as we picked off each other's. And it was cheap - each of our plates was about $8. Very reasonable.  Our waitress came to clear our plates (I don't remember her stopping by at any time to refill our water [annoying because I'm a camel] or ask if everything was alright) and then said the first nice thing to my friend: 'Your baby is cute.' She then laid down the check without asking if we wanted one or separate (pretty usual). She left and we laid down our three cards and asked if we could split it three ways (already making it easier than splitting out our exact pieces). She said she could only take two cards. Strange, but whatever. We were over their attitudes. Paid and left.  So the summary of that: awesome food, don't expect  the same of the service.",

    "text": "This small bistro allows for audible conversation with friends. But most importantly the food: It's brunch, breakfasts, and during the couple of years they've added dinners are all great! The menu is diverse and creative. Seafood, meats, cheeses, veggies come together in unique and delectable combinations. Coca is a comfortable place to enjoy eating and socializing. There is nothing pretentious at Coca, go in your favorite, relaxing clothes, take your own wine, beer,... it is byob...so you don't have to pay the exorbitant $$$ for a drink and taxes! The staff has always been delightful, they work as a team so I've never felt a delay in getting our dishes from the kitchen to the table. Coca is one of my go to restaurants, and I promise that my children tell me that I am picky about the quality of food and have high expectations of those serving it. Go and see for yourself.",

    "text": "This place is like an ever-so-slightly more upscaled older sister compared to the Square Cafe. It still sports a look that says DIY shabby chic, but the space is more comfortable than the Square Cafe.  Like most other reviewers, I enjoyed their food. The coffee was piping hot and plentiful. The smoothie was rich and well proportioned (neither lumpy nor runny). We've tried their pumpkin pancakes (good texture, not too sweet), their breakfast burrito (nice contrast between the creamy egg, the veggies, and the toasted wrap) and a side of sage sausages (well seasoned). Generally speaking, their food quality is higher than Square Cafe for about the same price.  We did not have a long wait (around 11am on a Saturday), though it was not immediately evident how we get ourselves on the wait list. The service quality is a bit spotty, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I think it's because the waitstaff has to take care of too many tables, not because they are inherently rude.   When they get around to it, they are perfectly pleasant.  4.5 stars",

So stop whining, if you're going on a Sunday for brunch either show up early before they open at 10 or be ready to wait at least half an hour just to sit down, especially if you have a bigger group.  Even if you show up at opening unless you get your order in right away you are going to wait to eat, anyhow.  That said, our brunch was almost PERFECT.  I had a special, Manchego grits with poached eggs, applewood smoked bacon and salsa.  The grits really were spectacular and I plan on making them myself at home.  The rest of my party had Challa French Toast with Brie and Fig Jam, almost a perfect combination.  We split a banana/mango/pineapple smoothie and it was also quite tasty.",

    "text": "Coca's had super bright colors and a cute cozy feel which was definitely a refreshing change from the monotony of the brunch locations around Carnegie Mellon University where I go to school.  We got there around 11:30 and put our names down; we were told there would be around a 30-40 min wait so we walked around the neighborhood for a bit.  I had their smoked salmon omelet and a double cappuccino.  She got their creme brulee french toast and a mixed greens salad.  Cappuccino was pretty standard; it was slightly above average but not super special.  Smoked salmon omelet came with grilled potatoes and a slice of watermelon.  The omelet also had sliced cherry tomatoes, scallions and dill.  Super fluffy and tasty; I'd definitely get it again!  I tried a couple pieces of the creme brulee french toast and it was sinfully delicious.  Note: Get there early or you'll have to wait (they open at 10 AM; there was still a wait as we left after 1 PM), and they might also be out of some of their specials (they were out of their crab hash).  On the car ride back we were already discussing what we'd get the next time we head back.",

    "text": "Cute little place that reminded me a bit of Berkeley.   We went late (around 2ish), so no lines - although I guess that meant service was a bit off as well since they were trying to prepare for closing. I mean, the waitress forgot to put in our orders, our water glasses went unfilled, they all seemed a bit rushed even though there weren't many people left. Or maybe service is just normally off. Who knows.  Food was not bad. But not drool-worthy. Or maybe I've been spoiled by NYC.   The mushroom omelette was nice and fluffy - slightly crispy on the edges, so a nice departure from the runny French style of my beloved little bistros. The sides were just sad though - two tiny pieces of bread and 2 completely under-ripe pieces of honeydew.   The challah French toast didn't live up the hype. While the brie worked better than expected, the toast was just too dense and not sweet enough for our expectations. I still crave the French toast from the Clinton St Baking Company in NYC.   And the smoothies made us sad that we didn't just suck it up and make it ourselves at home. So not worth the $3.   Now I realize how New Yorkers totally know brunch. Sorry, Pittsburgh. Nice try, but not quite there yet.",

    "text": "Now that I'm leaving Pittsburgh after 5 years, I figure the least I can do is write a good review for my go-to brunch spot.  I've been to coca cafe many times with friends and have always had a great time.  First of all, the coffee is excellent.  I am the type of person who grinds my own coffee and uses a french press at home bc I can't stand bad coffee.  They make GOOD coffee and come around often to refill.  The food is always good.  I can't remember specifics, but every dish I tried there over the years was outstanding, and all of my friends always thought their dishes were amazing too.  You should expect to wait outside for up to half an hour (or more?) if you come on a weekend morning, especially Sunday.  I'd recommend just getting there when they open, so you don't have to wait.  The atmosphere is somewhat hipsterish, but more importantly, very down to earth, casual, non-pretentious, and fun.  Not unusual to see hipsters at one table and a family of four at the next.  No one cares, everyone gets along.  Service was never that slow even on the busiest weekends and always friendly.  I'm going back home to LA where you can find any food on the planet and I will still very much miss this place.  That says a lot!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to ride our bikes down to Coca Cafe and get some breakfast. Once we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait.  A lot of people keep repeating that the service here is bad. I guess I can see where they are coming from if you're a pretty high strung person who is used to being in and out of a restaurant and fed as soon as you sit down. The Coca Cafe is not this place and it's really obvious. It's a pretty small cafe and you're going to have to deal with a little bit of waiting. The owner, or at least what I thought was a manager of some sort did not seat a group of two while we were waiting because the rest of their party was not there. This is a simple rule and it allows people who are ready and on time to get a seat. In a place as small as Coca Cafe you can't afford to seat half of a party while they wait however long for the rest of their people. This might be considered \"rude\" to people but it's born of necessity. The \"customer is always right\" mantra is not universally accepted at every establishment you patronize.  Anyway, with that out of the way. We were seated in less than 10 minutes and ordered two omelets. I had the wild mushroom omelet (shiitake and portabello) with Jarlsberg cheese, a side of grilled potatoes, and pumpernickel toast. My girlfriend had the tomato, feta, and pesto omelet. I got an orange juice with my water which was definitely freshly squeezed and delicious.  After a little bit of a wait (see my earlier rant) we got our food which was amazing. The omelets were full and incredibly hardy. The mushrooms were fresh and springy with a tiny bit of crunch to them. The Jarlsberg cheese was so mild that I forgot it was in there at first; you can choose from two different cheeses so next time I think I'll try the other cheese to see if it is less subtle. The egg was cooked just right, a little crispy brownness on the edges and fluffy everywhere else. Nowhere in the omelet did I find raw yolk which I absolutely hate. The potatoes were cooked through and crispy on the outside, seasoned to perfection.",

Started going to Coca a few years ago and the service staff used to be super nice.  I always expect a long wait, but they always made you feel welcome, so I didn't mind.  However, the past 3-4 times I've been there, the service has gone WAY downhill.  From the greeting to the service at the tables...wow.  2nd to last time I went I was told \"1 hour\" for 3 people.  Stood around outside for a bit...got cold and went inside to buy a to-go coffee (which I've always been able to do before).  Was told by one of the servers that it was \"discouraged\" to get coffee before we sat down, so we can go get coffee down the street...in a condescending \"why are you bothering me\" tone.  Um...you discourage people to buy coffee from you?  Last time I went, another 1 hr wait for 2 people.  Came back 30mins later, and wanted to see how far we were on the list.  The server snatched up the list, and said \"An hour from whenever I first told you\" and walked away.  Nice.  So we went to Square Cafe instead in Regent Square...just as busy, just as many people...but far nicer and actually apologized for the 20min wait time.",

I went with my teen daughter on a Sunday at noon and we tried: zucchini bread with chocolate chips - excellent & warm & moist! blueberry/mango/raspberry smoothie - very good mocha - very good southwest breakfast quesadilla with eggs, caramelized onions, muenster, guac, sour cream - very good french toast with goat cheese - very good  I called a half hour ahead to get our name on the list, and when we got there we had only a 5 minute wait - not bad.  The food was very good, but I wouldn't call it excellent.  The french toast I make at home doesn't have herbed goat cheese in it, but I think it's moister.  There were a few glitches in the service: late delivery of silverware; slow to take our main dish order after delivering the zucchini bread & drinks; never offered us water - we had to ask.  The folks were friendly, even if they were overworked.  There were about four groups of 2-4 people on the sidewalk outside waiting for a table.  I saw one group with small kids give up on the 30-40 min wait and go down the block for brunch at Dozen.  Overall, I would go back.  The waitress said that Tue-Fri breakfast or lunch is much less crowded.  Next time I might try the banana bread and the pumpkin pancakes.",

    "text": "I've been to Coca Cafe twice now and I really enjoy their food and the atmosphere.  Fortunately the two times that I've gone here recently it was a weekday and late morning just before the lunch rush starts - the two previous times that I tried to go was during peak hours and there was quite a wait so my companions and I opted for somewhere else.  I really like this local restaurant - the food is well prepared and fresh, the coffee is strong and delicious (just the way that I like it) and the servers are very friendly despite being busy.  On my first visit I had the Grilled shrimp & Manchego cheese grits with house salsa, apple smoked bacon topped with poached eggs.  It was hands down delicious and not at all greasy like some of the shrimp and grits that I've had at other restaurants.  My friend had the Pancetta Omelet with kale, reggiano and roasted tomatoes.  We both really enjoyed our meals and the coffee as I already stated was fantastic - it was strong, smooth, rich and low on acid - a near perfect cup of joe.    On my most recent visit, I was alone and stopped by for a late breakfast/early lunch and I was half tempted to order the shrimp and grits again, but when the waitress told me that the Seafood Etouffee that was on special that day was soon going to be taken off of the menu permanently, I decided that I had to try it.  Their Seafood Etouffee had 3 large shrimp, and 2 perfectly cooked scallops with a tomato base that was filled with crab and a bit of jasmine rice.  This was a meal!  I was hungry and this completely filled me up - I liked that there wasn't a lot of rice to overtake the dish and that it didn't dominate the delicious flavors of the seafood in the rich, flavorful tomato base.  The ONLY criticism I have is that it was actually a little too salty for my taste and I am someone who likes salt and it was a bit much, otherwise the dish was as good as any New Orleans restaurant that I've dined at during the over 20 times that I've been to N'Awlins.  Don't despair that it's no longer on the menu however because there are dozens of dishes on the menu that I'm sure are fabulous.  I'm looking forward to going back to Coca Cafe again and again.",

Our waiter was hard to understand as he ran through the specials and rang up our checks wrong. The omelet we're dry and barely had any cheese in them and the potatoes had no flavor other than some sour taste that we could not identify. Omelets have shrunk in size from last year when I was there. What happened?? Also the ceiling fan doesn't look like it's been cleaned in years. Zucchini bread was good.",

Waitress only checked back on us once - this was after we watched her take out trash and return to her tables without washing her hands. Admittedly, our food was very good.

Then went in for the buttermilk donut with a raspberry goat cheese icing.  It was the highlight of the meal and really went well with the richness of the coffee.  For my meal I ordered fried green tomatoes eggs benedict with the banana pepper hollandaise sauce.  Fried green tomatoes were thick, crunchy, and perfectly cooked.  However, the whole dish didn't work well together.  Instead of the traditional Canadian bacon, they used a thick cut, crisp bacon which tasted good but was impossibbbblleeee to cut through with the wimpy butter knife given to you.  It felt like you were supposed to pick up the eggs benedict to eat it, which makes for a messy brunch.  The hollandaise sauce was blander than most, and definitely had no banana pepper flavor.  The homefries were crisp and delicious.  I tasted one of my dining partner's pumpkin pancakes with maple butter and caramelized pears which was very tasty on a crisp fall day.  Service was pretty darn good for a busy breakfast place.  Overall, not bad.  If I was in the neighborhood, I'd go, but I certainly wouldn't travel far for this place.",

    "text": "Given that the quality of the food and service at Coca range from Meh to Wonderful, not to mention the hour-plus waits, I think there are several superior weekend brunch options in Pittsburgh.  They could improve things by offering the option of reservations, and/or expanding their space and service staff. They always seem to have one too few wait staff, in my opinion.  One particularly lousy time at brunch my partner and I waited twenty minutes to get coffee and water, and then an hour for our food (which came out cold).  They did give us a gift card to compensate, which was a thoughtful and we appreciated.   As negative as I am being, it's in part a counterpoint the glowing praises.  On the plus side, it is a very cute place, they have more vegetarian and vegan brunch options than almost anyplace in Pittsburgh (big props for the tofu scramble option for the vegans of the world!), and when the food is on point, it's pretty great. I had the three-cheese omelette one time with a few added vegggies, and it was out-of-this world tasty.   Do yourself a favor: Opt to have breakfast at Coca on a weekday morning.  On a Sunday morning, opt instead to show up at Park Bruges or Point Brugge promptly at 10:45.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that as a vegan, I never expect that restaurants that don't advertise vegan options will go out of their way to accommodate my dietary choices. However, Coca Cafe indicates several menu options as being able to be made vegan.   I ordered the vegan version of the Breakfast Sandwich, which is ordinarily served with over easy eggs, fresh avocado, apple smoked bacon and house kimchi on sourdough bread. To make this dish vegan required the replacement of the bread, replacement of the eggs, and removal of the meat (note: their soy sausage is vegetarian but not vegan).   What I received (after 45 minutes of waiting) was two fairly uncooked, unseasoned slabs of tofu on dry whole wheat toast with a smudge of avocado and kimchi on one side, with a side of unripe honey dew. My sandwich (and fruit) was completely devoid of flavor. I would have sent it back, but anticipated any replacement would have been similarly bland. Other local vegan-friendly restaurants will often add additional ingredients or at least some seasoning to dishes that lose a large amount of flavor due to the removal/substitution of primary ingredients, but this sandwich just felt like a lazy afterthought.  The two guests I was eating with ordered the (non-vegan version) Breakfast Sandwich and Pancetta Omelet respectively, both of which turned out to be disappointingly tasteless as well.   Again, I do not ever expect that a restaurant will really work to cater to my strict diet unless specified, but to suggest an abundance of vegan-friendly menu options and get this was just disheartening. Would not recommend to vegans and omnivores alike.",

Perhaps I need to take up on some of the other breakfast joints in town and broaden my impression of the city's food scene, but every meal here has been outstanding.  It pains me not to make some recommendations, but I've had nearly all the menu choices and everything has been solid.  So my suggestion is to pick what sounds best.    As for some of the other reviews, I love the atmosphere and have almost always seen the place hopping.  If the complaint is over wait times, then go to a place with a drive-through.  Otherwise, sit down and enjoy this darling little spot in Lawrenceville.  I'll not remark on the service.  But the food and the ambience are very strong aspects of Coca.",

However, it took almost 15 minutes for anyone to come over to us to say anything. We ordered food and coffee at the same time, and it took about 25 minutes to receive 3 coffees. After 75 minutes, we finally received our food, with no word from any one, except once. We did not get water for over an hour and a half after asking multiple times. The food was very good; however, it does not make up for waiting over an hour and a half in total. We then had to wait another 15 minutes to get a check, which we had to go up to the counter and ask for ourselves. We are usually not this picky, but it took everyone a very long time to receive their food, drinks, anything. A long piece of plastic was also found in the coffee, and was not taken off the bill until we complained. Overall, if you are very patient and have over 2 hours to give, I do not recommend coming here.",

    "text": "I had heard so much about this place that I wanted to give it a try. I arrived shortly after 9 midweek and there was plenty of tables both front and in the back. The front decor is very trendy. The back is just your usual style with booths but air covered.  I saw a sign by the entrance indicating that they use the no wait app but for me that wasn't an issue. I was given multiple menus to look over including mimosas, drinks, and of course their breakfast menu. I was in the mood for an omelette and after asking about certain toppings which I didn't understand I learned their omelettes are made with 9 yes 9 eggs! I thought 5 was too much when I was in Chicago. I asked if they could be made with egg whites. I was told yes but for $1.50 more. Please note that their prices have increased slightly if you check out their website and they have noted outside a brand new menu.  To me it looked like much of the same stuff. I decided to steer clear of the French toast and pancakes and settled for one of the eggs Benedict. Here I learned they are made with two poached eggs that sit on top of an English muffin. I ordered the various mushroom type which come with potatoes. My coffee seemed lukewarm but the lady obliged by giving me another cup. The place has an extensive beverage selection on the chalkboard including hot chocolate. Juices are also available.  There weren't very many people inside and I was surprised how long it took to get my breakfast! Must have been a good 15-20 minutes. I chalked that one up to them having to make an omelet with 9 eggs. I would have liked to have seen that omelet but didn't. All I know from what she told me it is huge!!!  Anyway I finally got my food. The potatoes were good but seemed a bit dry. The mushroom eggs Benedict I thoroughly enjoyed. They have one gender neutral restroom in the front section.   My waitress was busy but attentive to my needs. I got the check and I'm glad I ordered what I did because this place can be pricey. The place is small so I can see very well how easily it gets crowded for brunch. This place also serves lunch but they close early usually around 3.  It is located in lower Lawrenceville not far from Expresso a mano. You can park on one of the off streets for free if you are lucky. If you want a good and hearty breakfast meal for a descent price there are plenty of other options around the city. If you have time to kill and want to spend extra money for average food then you've come to the right place.",

Our food came after about 45 minutes of waiting.   Luckily, the food was delicious. My eggplant eggs benedict was perfect. The eggplant was not too thick and nice and crispy. Their lemon basil hollandaise sauce was also the perfect complement. The potatoes could have used a bit more seasoning. My friend also enjoyed her french toast.   Overall, the quality of the food was fantastic. The reason for the four stars is the amount of waiting.

Food takes forever to come out. Kind of a shame how bad the service is, considering that the food is actually pretty good, and that there's a wide selection on the menu. Ordered the donut holes, ended up being cake/brownie balls? One had a hair in it. Orange juice took 30 min to be served. Server also charged for bacon that was never brought out. Not worth it.",

I'm a take out fan and their phone has been broken since March. Here's the solution: call an alarming number of times and they'll start to recognize your phone number and call you back from someone cell phone. It's complete absurdity. There are also three (at least) menus floating around online, none of which are apparently accurate. One time I showed up to grab my take out for a group and the woman working only told me when I arrived that their credit card machine was down. Luckily I had enough cash to pay because she didn't even know where the closest ATM was. Like I said, it's a personal problem that I keep ordering from here bc the food is good and I live next door but overall, don't waste your time. They have no respect for the customer and basically don't give a shit if you eat there or not. They're miserable.",

The service was extremely slow. I was in very good company so I don't mind waiting for over 20 minutes to get my drink. I ordered the tofu scramble, which I had had before, but this time it was overly salty and barely edible. My friend is on a specific diet and ordered the egg dish without the feta.  She was served the feta but they held the fruit. I suppose they do both start with \"f\". I'm just not sure it's worth going back again. I'm giving three stars because my drink was very good when I finally received it.",

While there, service was slow and our waiter did not know the menu well.     I ordered the cappuccino which was not very good.  I also had the corn flake crusted french toast.  This was lukewarm at best.  It had likely been under a not so good heat lamp for some time.  This is not a large place, they can do better.    I am not sure what is going on with this place.

Even if that was True, that's not something you share with a group who have been waiting for an hour. It certainly doesn't get people excited to eat here.

No one acknowledged me when I walked in.  Waited several minutes just to be recognized and seated.   Service staff seemed stressed out and short staffed for the volume of tables offered.  The menu offerings were great though (including kid servings of regular items for $4), so we were excited to give it a chance. Waited more than 45 min for our food.  Kids got their food so long before we did they were done and ready to leave before we got our food.  My son asked for maple syrup, which had a strange film of mold at the surface so I didn't let him use it.  Finally our food came.  Omelette was soggy in the middle-- hubs didn't eat it.  My eggs Benedict had a soggy English muffin and, I'm not sure what happened to the egg, but the white was absent and I was served just the yolk with a straggle of white hanging off of it.    All in all, looked much better than it was.  Be prepared to spend 2 hours to eat.  My advice to the owner would be to please have the staff to serve the number of tables offered... and quality check the food",

After we placed our order, we did not get our food for 45 minutes and it was delivered from the kitchen. The wait staff did not check on us and barely acknowledged us. My water glass was empty over half of the time and my friend could not drink water because there was something in her glass.   When we finally were asked about our checks (once we put our cards on the table) there was an error with our receipts. We spoke to someone about this (perhaps manager?) and she would not let us finish our sentence and kept covering up the receipt and would say \"all that matters is the card numbers are right\" but our names were wrong and they charged the wrong cards. They were very unhelpful and refused to listen to the costumer (even interrupted us) several times.   I have enjoyed the food, but there are so many places in Pittsburgh with similar food that also staff people who are kind and attentive. We never received an apology for anything throughout our entire 1 1/2 hour experience and we will not be visiting again.",

Our food finally came out and it was cold. Nothing on our plate was hot. We told the waitress and the only thing said was that our meals were not sitting waiting in the back.

    "text": "So apparently this place is really crowded on weekends?  I went on a weekday around lunch when it was only about half full, thankfully. The decor is super cute - a bit retro. The tables are bit and spaced openly - I love that they're not cramming tables into their small space.  First of all, with their awesome sounding menu and elevated food concept, I would've expected their coffee to be excellent. It was dilute and a bit burnt and tasted as crappy as (if not a little worse than) 24-hour diner coffee. Tsk.  Second, the service was really crappy. I don't know if they were understaffed or what, but the waitress was in a rush to take our orders but rarely refilled our waters and coffees. And food took forever to come out... what's up with that?  Third, the food. It was a bit of a letdown. The pesto/sun dried tomato/salami omelet is one of my favorite combinations at my favorite brunch spot in Chicago. This version was alright... but something was missing, and the flavors just didn't seem balanced. The omelet seemed like it was supposed to be fluffy, but it wasn't that great. My friend's smoked salmon omelet was collapsed (not to mention underwhelming in smoked salmon flavor and presence). I didn't try the challah french toast - no complaints or raves from the person who ordered it though.  I'm still willing to give this place another chance. And by no means was the food bad - just not super awesome. But the reviews here and the menu itself sounded AWESOME. The actual food didn't quite live up to the expectations.   Maybe it's a fluke? Maybe since brunch food is a pretty competitive and saturated niche in Chicago, my standards are set pretty high? Maybe they are just staffed better in the front and back on the weekends? Who knows. I'll see next time.",

My meal came with toast and had to hunt down a server to get butter then had to wait five minutes to get butter with no apology or excuse from the server. Then I turned the toast over and noticed it was burnt to a crisp and inedible. Because our server was so hard to get a hold of, I knew if I tried to get new toast my omelette would be cold by the time I would get it. I added avocado to my omelette and it was literally brown--very old. Why do they think it's ok to serve that?? Very meh, bad service and chefs that think it's ok to serve inedible food.",

So many specialty things to choose from and they all sounded so good.   I had the sun dried tomato pesto omelette with sausage and pepperoni. Yes it was just as amazing as it sounds. The egg was fluffy and had a perfect amount of all the ingredients. I was wary of the pepperoni in my omelette at first but it really complimented the other flavors for a tasty combination.   My boyfriend had the herbed goat cheese stuffed French toast. First of all I'd like to say that I am a fan of French toast stuffed with pretty much anything. It was awesome. It didn't even need syrup with the creaminess of the cheese and powdered sugar on top. Perfect!  My only complaint was the cramped feel of the place. There was no way for me to get out of my chair once I say down. Also the water glasses were dirty. Luckily I got a cup if chai tea, which was delicious.",

After and hour and a half, we asked if they could split us up. They REFUSED to be accommodating in any way! We were getting pretty hungry. After TWO HOURS they still had not seated us! Seriously. We left hungry. I will NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone or eat there myself. Who in their right mind waits TWO HOURS for food? Look at other reviews. Food takes 75 minutes to come? We were nuts.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined here for brunch this past Saturday around 1pm and had a very enjoyable experience. We called ahead and were told the wait was 45 minutes, but before we even arrived and parked- after 30 minutes- we were called and told our table was ready. We were seated as soon as we arrived at a corner table in the back. Waters were brought out immediately, much appreciated since it was a blazing hot day! Being it was hot- what did we both order? Hot coffee :) which was quite refreshing actually since we were in the cool back room. I went with the smoked salmon omelette with dill, chives, goat cheese, and tomatoes. I chose the potatoes over the toast. The omelette was amazing! The creaminess of the goat cheese paired perfectly with the smoky flavor of the salmon. I absolutely loved the addition of the dill and chives too. The potatoes were nothing special to write home about. The boy had the four cheese omelette- cheddar, Gouda, goat cheese, and American. He chose the rye toast with his. He said the  omelette was fluffy, cheesy goodness! Service was pretty good- I wish the coffee flowed a little more often than it did but when we could flag down the server we did get our refills. They have a ton of interesting sounding menu options - various other omlettes and Brie stuffed French toast in particular- that I'd love to go back and try in the future!",

I forget) pancakes, and took a bite of a sandwich while my friend wasn't looking (just kidding, I asked...or did I?!?).  All amazingly good. And super filling.

I've read through some of the other less glowing reviews and wonder if it's just that their consistency might be an issue. On this visit, we had some amazing plates - I thoroughly enjoyed their breakfast quesadilla, and my wife enjoyed one of their specialty omelets. The food was served promptly and at the right temperature, usually one of my biggest gripes with eating breakfast in many restaurants. Our waitress was very friendly, and didn't miss a beat with our table's fairly complex ordering. The ambience was great - not too noisy, but upbeat enough to be interesting.  We'll be back to try the place a few times and 'finalize' our impression, but the first impression was a great one... and first impressions count a lot!",

The menu has changed in the last few years, so some of my go-to orders that were on the lunch menu are no longer served. (Bring back the curried chicken salad!)   The brunch menu consists mostly of egg dishes, but the standouts for us were the BiBimBap & the Herbed French Toast.   Servers are always friendly, but often seem a little confused. You can definitely expect to wait a while for your drinks to be made, so don't expect a quick meal at Coca Cafe. So take the opportunity to order a drink, I'd recommend the Lavender Steamer, and relax before your food comes.",

Anyways, food is decent (overpriced) but expect to wait a long time for any attention from the staff. I tried giving them the eye so many times I couldn't believe they didn't ask me what I needed. When I got my breakfast with potatoes, they of course do not ask if I need anything else once they serve the plate, they leave the second the drop the plate so I didn't even have a chance to ask for something. Yes, I am sure they are busy, but come on, never had this poor of service in a while. Anyways, when I got the potatoes I knew I couldn't ask for ketchup because I didn't want to wait an hour for it. So ya, I should stop going. They have a couple great menu items but my tips for you are eat before u leave and bring your own water and don't want more than one cup of coffee. And have 2.5 hrs to do this.   Ways for Coca to improve: -Provide water pitchers -Greet people when they walk in -Put ketchup/hot sauce and typical things asked for on the table since you won't get it to us within the hour of our plate being served -ask if we need anything at least once during the experience  Good luck!",

The service was alright. It was clear that the people working here were kind and upbeat, but it didn't seem like they had enough staff to take the orders, make drinks, serve food, and watch the door. Our server was a nice guy, but he took 10 minutes to bring us coffee and waters and forgot to put in our order, so we ended up waiting longer than we'd expected for food.   The food itself was awesome. I loved the spinach and mushroom omelet I ordered. It was the perfect amount of greasy and healthyish breakfast food all on one plate! I also asked for jam and received the most wonderful apricot compote I've ever tasted. It was like pure heaven in a little jam dish.   I would go back to Coca Cafe and I would recommend it to others. My only concern is that if the restaurant is busy, be prepared to wait a while.",

I don't believe the bad service and wait times are due to poor servers, as they seemed to be always moving and working. But something was off for sure. Maybe they were understaffed, maybe there's a lack of equal work distribution... I don't know.  All I do know we arrived before 10 AM and didn't get out of there until after 12:30 PM. It wasn't event that busy by regular restaurant standards, bums in seats but no major waiting line. Took 30 minutes from when we were seated to event have someone take our drink/food orders. Took an hour and a half to get our food - how hard is it to make french toast?  I had the Challah bread french toast with Brie and fig preserves. It was pretty good. Not a 90 minute wait good, that's for sure. You get two slices of french toast cut into halves (4 pieces), the brie was almost non-existent and aside from some mixed berry garnish that was all you got. Every other dish at our table got home fries at the least, French toast... nada.  We went here because it seemed to be the only breakfast joint in Lawrenceville, but with the time we wasted here we could have gone to the Strip district, eaten and come back and still been waiting.  Nice spot but needs a lot of work in my personal opinion...  Eatcrest Out",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Coca Cafe. The original reason I decided to dine here was because brunch is my favorite meal of the day, and their brunch menu looked fantastic. I saw they had shakshuka, which is one of my favorite foods, so I had to try it since I can't find it at any restaurants where I'm from. The shakshuka was indeed good, but that's about as far as the praise goes for this place.  Upon arriving, my boyfriend and I were given a 15 minute wait time and the girl took our phone number and said she would call when our table was ready. We went back to the car to wait considering it was pretty cold. We sat in the car for over 30 minutes without a call. Finally, we went back in and asked when our table would be ready. Low and behold, we were next. We were sat in the very back corner of the restaurant which seemed to be ignored by most workers.  We weren't waited on right away, but that gave us time to look over the menu. We both ordered an iced chai latte to drink. I consider myself an iced chai connoisseur, and let me tell you, this one was nasty. Not only was the taste just not that good, but minutes after starting to drink it, my boyfriend got the burps and an upset stomach... I'm not sure what kind of quality milk they use but it obviously didn't agree well with him.   Some time went by before a different waitress came to take our order. I, shakshuka, and my boyfriend, tofu scramble with avocado mash and potatoes. The food took a solid 30-45 minutes to come out, and the entire time we waited, we were not checked on once. Finally, a very nice man from the kitchen brought our food to us. He was the most attentive person we dealt with the entire morning, as he asked us if we needed anything else. He was clearly busy so we said no thank you and let him get back to his job.   The food was about the only good thing about this place. The shakshuka was as I expected, but my brother makes better. Still, it wasn't disappointing. My boyfriend's tofu scramble seemed alright but he couldn't even enjoy it because his stomach was hurting so bad. We asked a waitress for water and she said she'd bring the pitcher around but never came back. We waited another 15-20 minutes or so before my boyfriend went up to the counter to get our check so we could get the heck out of this place.  Overall, we invested about 2 hours of time and about $40 into this place, and it wasn't worth it at all. We had amazing food the rest of our trip, and this was our last meal before heading home. Pittsburgh is a city full of exciting eateries with high-quality chefs and superb wait staff, but Coca Cafe just didn't quite fit in.",

We had to move to sit closer to a fan and debated leaving altogether due to the heat. It's a small cozy food spot with coffee and boozy options. When I asked about the cocktails (that are on their wall in chalk) I was told there was a pause, a sigh, and a \"not right now- I can't\". It was after 12 so it doubt it was a liquor licensing issue. I suppose it was an overwhelmed worker issue. I ordered the oats because I wasn't super hungry. They had lots of delicious options on the menu but it was so warm in there I couldn't imagine how much more uncomfortable I would be with a hot meal. My husband ordered the avocado omelet was and I had the oats. The oats were what you would expect them to be. It was fine and appropriately priced at 4 bucks with a bit of fruit on top. I wished they were a bit sweeter but they were a nice fresh, cool, and healthy option. His omelette was so delicious!! The omelette itself had so much delicious flavor. The salsa was fresh and balanced it perfectly. It came with the option of a salad or potatoes. Both were great. Our friend had he breakfast sandwich and it was filling and delicious according to him.  It's my second time here- food has been great both times and they have amazing options. It definitely keeps this place flooding. The service and atmosphere not so much. I had a little bit of an attitude from our server last time too and thought it might have been a one time thing. Might be the standard. Probably won't be back but if you're not easily offended and just want a fresh good meal then check it out!",

    "text": "This is an easy going local cafe with a unique menu. It's special that you can rely on Coca to have breakfast foods for you all day, but they're not you're mom's breakfast foods.   The options here are a bit of a twist on your classic comforts -like kimchi and bacon on your breakfast sandwich or tumeric and nutritional yeast in your omelette. Having said that, you likely won't find these options in many other places around the city.  The cafe has a lived in, hipster kind of vibe, so expect the quirkiness that comes along with that. There are mismatched chairs and retro round tables spanning the cafe with small booth style seating area in the back. Large windows allow plenty of natural light to flood the cafe.   The service here is in no rush, so make sure you come feeling relaxed with plenty of time. The service won't be completely attentive, so if you need someone's attention, don't be afraid to go ask for it.  The sandwiches were actually twice the size I expected. It's great to get a sandwich with the sides, plus add another small plate option and split everything with someone. Or, it's easy to take the other half of your sandwich home.   There's a lot of free parallel parking on all the side streets, or metered parking on the main street in front of the cafe.",

The Challah French toast had some weird stuff on it that made it taste like something my mom would make, and she can't cook. She might actually make a better French toast.  I would rather eat at McDonald's. The best thing there was probably the water. Even though the doughnuts hole things were a 3/10. Those two things have Coca Cafe the one star rating. My boyfriend and I payed 32 dollars for a crap meal.",

You honestly cannot go wrong with any of the omelette options. Their drink assortment is tasty as well. I definitely recommend their earl grey and lavender latte. I also used yelp ahead of time to make a reservation so it expedited our waiting time. But the prior reviews are not wrong, the service is slow about 30 minutes after ordering will your food arrive. The prices are reasonable and the ambience is very cozy for a Saturday or Sunday brunch. It may be a little hard to find parking but there are plenty of side streets. I will definitely be back to try their other food items. Everything was really delicious!",

Normally, I can look past this, but both times I dined at Coca Cafe, the wait time after being seated was excessive and the restaurant seemed perpetually understaffed. The 2nd time I dined there, I did not receive cutlery until a good 10 minutes after my food had arrived, and by the time I was able to start eating, my entree was cold.  Focusing on the food, I'd highly recommend the eggplant eggs Benedict and shakshuka to everyone out there. The eggplant eggs Benedict has perfectly crisp eggplant slices, which complements the Basil Hollandaise well. The poached eggs were just the right amount of runny. For the shakshuka, be prepared to have your taste buds tingle! Perfectly spiced and seasoned, especially when paired with the pita.",

    "text": "I am unimpressed by this place. I have been there five times and only two times I actually got to eat.  Two of the times, I made plans with friends to eat there for breakfast. After double checking their hours on their website, we arrived 15-30 minutes after \"opening\" and the lights were off, the door was locked and no one was inside. There was no sign communicating a change in hours or emergency that required them not to open.  A different time, I planned to meet a friend at 8:30am (30 minutes after their website says they open). When I arrived the door was still locked but a woman was inside. When she unlocked the door to let us in, she made no attempt to apologize for opening late or forgetting to unlock the door. I did get to eat there this time (my first experience doing so). However, the woman was sweeping the shop while we were there. When she brought our food, she did not wash her hands between sweeping and serving our food. Gross!  One of the other experiences I had there was when I showed up on a Sunday to have brunch and there were no open tables. We were told the wait was 45minutes +, but there was nowhere to stand. It's a very odd set up because when you enter the restaurant you are immediately in the dining area, no vestibule, no real hostess/host stand. Naturally, it's very uncomfortable (and I'm not sure even allowed) to stand and wait. So we just went elsewhere.  The only time I showed up and ate with minimal issues, the food was great! However, I've had enough of this place and their lack of consistency. Change your hours on your website if you aren't going to be open! Seems like a poor business model.  If you are looking for a spot nearby that will be open and serves wonderful food might I suggest Caffe Mona.",

So my date and I was in to put our name on the list, did so and was told about \"30 minutes\", also that the espresso machine was down so we could go down the street, grab a coffee and they would text us, so we put out names on the yelp waiting list, which is a great addition to this app btw, and went to grab a coffee.... that coffee at espresso Mano was the best thing we had all day. The 30 minute wait turned into 48 minutes, which in itself would not be bad, but that wasn't all of it! Once we sat down, we ordered our Bloody Mary and our meal.... 30 minutes later the Bloody Mary came.. it was awful, no ice and thick like tomato soup and almost no vodka in it. The food showed up 1 hour and 35 minutes later.. I kid you not!! It was ridiculous  They claimed they didn't expect it to be busy, with this kind of service, they won't have to worry, it won't be that busy in the future if they keep that up.",

The egg was over cooked and hard to break. It just looked like a leftover plate not something freshly made at all. I am so disappointed see this place going downhill.

In fact, we found ourselves comparing it to great breakfast experiences we have had in Puerto Rico and Seattle. The place's interior is cute to begin with; and the menu is so much more interesting than the average restaurant. Most important, they pulled off the unusual touches. It was hard to choose between the creative omelette choices, and the waitress was really helpful with this. I selected the roasted vegetable omelette and it was excellent, both the roasted veggies and the spices. My partner had the breakfast sandwich with eggs and sausage and was equally pleased. Even the bread - which I learned was from Allegro Bakery in Squirrel Hill - was much better than what is typically offered with breakfasts. We are looking forward to a second visit there and are particularly hoping to get there for Sunday brunch!",

I had the avocado omelet, which was pretty good, but I think they forgot the jalepeno cheese in it.  $10.50 tab, before tip.

Upon getting there I told the waitress that we were there and would be outside, at this time she said it would probably be about 20 more minutes! Ok so we took a walk, came back, waited some more. Needless to say I called at 12:07, was told 45 minutes and did not get seated until 1:38. An hour and a half later!!! I watched countless tables that were below my name on the list get called. I'm a little flustered, starving, and now all my other plans for the day are ruined. By the time we. Were seated half the items on the special menu were sold out. I'm very frustrated.

    "text": "I went here for brunch on a Saturday with my friend since she said she's heard good things about this place.  This place is next door to Piccolo Forno.  When we got there, the place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated outside.  We came inside and put our names down for a table.  The place is quite big.  There are dining areas in the front and back rooms as well as a few outdoor tables hidden in the back where it's nice and quiet.  We sat outside underneath the shade.  I ordered almond french toasts, which were slices of baguette bread (sliced on the bias), prepared french toast style with thin slices of almond on top and drizzled with lemon butter.  The toasts were crunchy (but not dry or hard) at the crust and golden toasty but soft and dense inside, which is just the way I like them.  No soggyness. The lemon butter complimented the cinnamon and almond flavors of the toasts quite well. While we were eating, it started to drizzle but because we were sitting under the trees, we didn't get wet at all and didn't have to move.  It was interesting to eat outside while it was raining.  Overall, even though I'd only been there once I enjoyed the entire experience.  Service was good.",

However, they take your cell phone number and call when your table is ready, so you can walk around the neighborhood and check out the cute shops while you wait.    The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was delicious.  I had the egg white omelet - I am a sucker for anything with goat cheese.  Had a hard time choosing because everything on the menu sounds great.  My friend had the breakfast sandwich...the bread looked amazing.  They were both served with potatoes...yum.  We loved our food and look forward to trying more of the menu.",

I found the servings to be very large and delicious, especially the 4-cheese omelet. There was decent service for the crowd and the food and coffee weren't sacrificed. I'm looking forward to another delicious breakfast here.  It's a little more expensive than my typical breakfast choice but given the food quality and quantity, the price is more than reasonable. As a tip, I arrived promptly on a Saturday morning (9am is when they open), and there were plenty of tables open.",

My friend and I split two of the brunch options- the french toast with lemon cream and almond sauce on top (which was out of this world) and the egg sandwich with veggie sausage (which was also really good).  It ended up being way too much food but it was so freaking good.  I am not sure what they do to their eggs but they tasted far better than any eggs I have ever had anywhere else.  The french toast was killer.  I see why this place often has lines waiting- phenomenal brunch.",

Everyone else is right, though -- the wait is excruciatingly long. Their tables are all odd sizes, which means they often seat parties of 6 before parties of 2, or parties of 2 at massive tables... etc. Not bad when the weather is nice and you don't mind standing on the street, but awful when it's winter.  Also: their standard coffees and teas are quite good, but their \"specialty\" espresso beverages are awful. Too sugary, burnt-tasting... yuck.",

It is not very handicap friendly (as far as I could tell, maybe there was an area that was but some f the tables were on ledged platforms etc that would make wheelchair access difficult).  The food here is excellent.  While there are other places in town that have lovely pancakes, omelets etc., this is the first place that I have seen that sees fit to innovate a bit with their menu.  They have a savory french toast which is stuffed with an herbed goat cheese that is absolutely delicious and a really pleasant surprise.",

Unfortunately the service can be seriously lacking in-part due to the fullness of the place for brunch, and in part due to less than attentive waitstaff. My major issue here is that the place could be a LOT cleaner. As someone who has worked in foodservice for a long time, that was one of the first things I noticed, and I wonder about (but try not to think on too long) the conditions in the kitchen as a result. If the place was a little more kept-up I'd definitely give it higher marks.",

The atmosphere is Europe meets SoHo, and it gives a retro vibe. There is local art covering the walls and great window lighting.  Sunday brunch is their specialty, and that is when you will wait at least an hour. You can always go grab a coffee at Espresso A  Mano and visit the great Lower Lawrenceville shops. All of the items on the brunch menu are unique, but well thought-out, and delicious. You can tell everything is extremely fresh. They even have fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. My personal favorite dish is the Southwestern Breakfast Wrap made with tofu and a side of guacamole. The daily breakfast and lunch menus are equally as inventive, offering pancakes and french toast, pastries, eggs, sandwiches and wraps, and salads. They cater to vegetarians and vegans, which is always refreshing. The lunch barbecued tofu salad is very good, atop fresh mixed greens. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and they manage to remain calm even when it seems the whole city is at their door. I would recommend this place to anyone who is visiting the city, artistic, vegetarian, or just if they are really into Sunday brunch!",

Basically, they took our phone number and told us to go wait somewhere else. While at this time we were still waiting for the third person in our party to arrive this was kind of OK but it was freezing outside and we didn't know where to go to wait. It took us 15 minutes to walk back to our car, decide to go somewhere else and just as I was about to call Coca to cancel our walk-in reservation, they called us to say they had a table ready. Now because of the initial information of us probably waiting for 45 minutes, there has been some internal confusion and inconvenience in our little group of 3 because it was a \"no\" at first and then it became a \"yes\".  We came back to Coca, still waiting for our third member and were seated. In like five minutes we were asked if our friend was on his way. We said yes but the experience itself already became really frustrating and stressful as our friend had just left his place and decided that he wasn't in the mood for food but was gonna still join us for coffee. Was it OK for Coca that he would just have coffee? Were we being inappropriate blocking a 4 person table with 3 people eating and 1 just having coffee? Cut the long story short, although the food was really good, our experience here has been really stressful for me. I like places where I can show up and eat without an expected wait time of 45 minutes and I'm not rushed to leave the place immediately. It's brunch after all, it's supposed to be chill...",

We expected about the slow service like others had mentioned since we have been there many times.   The waitress took our orders and we started to wait. After 30-40 minutes, a waiter came to asked us again what we ordered. We saw the waitress started to bring food to tables came after us. We knew then they probably messed up our orders.   Then around an hour passed, other tables came after us started to finish their meals. We asked the waitress and she said there were two big tables in front of us so tables came later have to wait. Just then, they brought food to another table came after us!   Another waitress came and said, \"Those guests have been there the WHOLE time and you came in after them.\" I was really disappointed that the waitress just lied to my face. We watched them came in while we were waiting.   \"This is the part of the experience!\" That waitress added. Whether she meant the slow service part or the lying part, I don't know.   I also don't know why apologizing would be so hard for them. From start to finish, not a single sorry. I am sad that this was one of our favorite brunch spots. But if this lying to customers' faces is part of the experience, I don't think I will go back there again.",

We sat in the back at a funky 1960's repurposed booth, cleverly cut in half. Love the interior.  We started our morning with fresh squeezed juice, Carrot orange ginger, so tasty. The cafe was very busy, our food took a while to be prepared. My omelette arrived. It was a wild mushroom, gruyere, and spinach omelette topped with ramp pesto. It was a huge portion, cooked perfectly and served with seven seed toast. I took a bite of the omelette, the ramp pesto stung my tongue with oxidized garlic, it was very strong and very fresh. The toast had a weird flavor, perhaps a seed I am not familiar with or it tasted like mold? I am not so sure. My handsome hunk of a husband had an omelette as well. He ordered the avocado, apple bacon, jalepeno muenster omelette topped with fresh salsa. His omelette was served with deep fried home fries. His omelette was also massive and mouth watering.  The server was having an off day, she never refilled our waters, or checked our table before breakfast was served. I had spilled a bit of my juice and did not have a napkin to wipe it up. A young man arrived with our food and was kind enough to bring us silverware and napkins. When we finished our breakfast, it was past noon, she could have tempted us with dessert, but did not offer. I would assume they have fabulous dessert.   We will return to Coca Cafe. I will try the seven seed toast again to confirm my suspicion.",

We arrived right at 8 when they opened and there was no one else in the restaurant. We all ordered our drinks/food and were extremely disappointed to realize that despite being the first customers, it took 50 minutes to cook 4 breakfasts - three of which were the same. Eventually when the food came out, it was lukewarm at best (aside from the potatoes which you could tell were freshly cooked). I guess I just don't quite understand how on a super slow weekday when you're the first customers into an establishment, your food comes out almost cold after waiting close to an hour to get it. We were going to complain and send it back but after waiting so long we were so hungry we ate it anyway. Oh, I also have to add that I found a hair in my avocado mash that was dark brown (I have blonde hair) and all of my friends and myself had our hair up from work so I can only gather that the hair came from whoever was cooking the food. Gross. Very disappointed and will not be giving Coca Cafe any business in the future and unfortunately do not recommend.",

Yes, Coca Cafe, your food is good--excellent, even. 5 stars for food. Stars are in the negative for service. The first time I came here, I was innocently duped like everybody else, tempted by \"there's this really great brunch spot in Lawrenceville!\" An hour wait for a table is \"hang-ger\" inducing enough, but another hour wait on top of that AFTER being seated is unacceptable. This happened once, and I assumed it was maybe a fluke. When it happened the second and last time I went here, the exact same thing occured.. The waitress even spilled juice all over my boyfriend's shoe (our meal was comped after that, at least). Honestly, I feel bad for the servers because it isn't necessarily their fault that the food takes forever. Kitchen staff, get your sh*t together.   Seriously, do not plan to dine at Coca Cafe for brunch unless you will not be hungry for at least another hour and a half.",

Why order from the regular menu when the specials look so amazing! Honestly, we can always order from the regular menu, right?

    "text": "Food: The menu is small, but every item on it sounds delicious.  There are traditional breakfast items like oatmeal, omelets, and french toast, and also brunch-type items like breakfast burritos and paninis.  Vegetarians and carnivores will have plenty of options.  We ordered the almond french toast which was drizzled with lemon creme and topped with strawberries and also the apple panini which had cream cheese, raisins, cranberries and other goodies and came with a side of fresh fruit.  Both were more than enough to fill us up, and we also shared a side of the homefries which were very tasty.  The french toast was fantastic as well, and both meals were unique and delicious.    Price: The overall cost of breakfast was slightly above average but the variety of ingredients and great taste of the food made up for it.  Drinks: The coffee was good, and the Almond Coca Mocha was fantastic.  Coca Cafe also makes their own juices, and we tried the carrot-ginger-orange juice.  It was very natural/healthy tasting.  There were also smoothies to try but we stopped at two drinks each.  Atmosphere: There is a bigger dining room in the front and a smaller, narrow dining area in the back next to 38th street.  The back room has large windows that let in sunshine and fresh air.  The back room is primarily tables for two, and the tables aren't too close together.  There aren't a lot of tables, and they fill up quick.  We parked on Butler Street and didn't have to walk far.  We tried Coca Cafe on a weekend morning once in the past and we were offered a 45 minute wait for a table, so we left.  On a weekday the restaurant was still full but we didn't have to wait for a table.  Service: The service was the only questionable part of our trip to Coca Cafe.  Once seated, we waited a solid 10-15 minutes before we were even offered drinks.  The homemade food was delicious, but we waited quite a while for it and had our coffee refilled only once, at the very end of the meal.  The waitress was friendly but seemed rushed and slightly frazzled.  The restaurant was busy, but we've seen it busier.  (+): imaginative breakfast options, delicious food, good coffee and other drinks  (-): often very busy which leads to wait time for a table and mediocre service, slightly above average cost for breakfast  Would I go back again? Yes.  To get the almond french toast again, and to try some of the other interesting options.",

First off, I'd like to say that I generally prefer to rate restaurants based on the quality of the food only and not service, atmosphere etc. The food here is indeed very good. I've been here for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner (tapas). I'd say the breakfast and brunch weren't as exceptional. You get a good omelet sure, but in the end of the day it's just an omelet. The lunch is great, I'm not a big fan of sandwiches but I generally enjoy their sandwiches way more than other places. That said there aren't many options other than sandwiches, which is something I'd really like to see. Finally the tapas they have for dinner are hands down great.  Honestly, I would give this establishment a 5 star review if it were not for the pretty lousy service and sometimes outright attitude you get here.",

Let me preface this by saying that we are both in the service industry (he, a bartender; I a manager, ex-server), so we are polite and understanding in these kinds of situations.  We walked in, and they looked as though they had just got done being busy- a lot of dirty tables and frazzled looking servers.  OK, we get it; we'll wait.  No worries.  So, we stand awkwardly at the front of the restaurant (as there's not any clear signage as to where you should go) waiting to be acknowledged.  But, alas, three servers continue to walk past us and completely ignore us.  It's cool you're busy, but can't you at least let us know that you can see us?  So, my friend chases down a server after about 5 agonizing minutes of awkward lingering and strange looks from the servers.  He asks how long the wait is, and she tells him at least an hour, despite all of the empty tables that just needed bussed.  I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant.  So, we left and went to Deluca's.  I certainly hope that those servers had a better day after we left.",

So, we went with Plan B, which was popping in to get on the list and then heading down the street for coffee and window shopping.  I don't know what the status of this list is, but that was my experience.  Anyway, we were visiting just for the weekend and enjoyed the hour wait because it allowed us to look around the Lawrenceville neighborhood.  And the delicious food awaiting us was worth it!  I had an excellent and overly filling challah french toast sandwich with eggs, cheese and asparagus.  My friend loved the southwest breakfast wrap.

My first impressions were quite positive:  - The decor is very trendy and reminded me of some favorite brunch places back in NYC. - There was a short wait (20 min) which would normally be a turn off, but Coca takes your cell phone number and calls you when your table is ready, leaving you the freedom to explore the boutiques lining Butler Ave. I really wish more restaurants would do this! - The banana bread and the zucchini bread (see photo) were fantastic! I highly recommend them. Whatever is in the butter that accompanies each must have crack in it b/c I couldn't stop eating it! - My girlfriend got the goat cheese stuffed french toast. Not the best stuffed french toast ever (head to Dozen for that...mmm...hungry just thinking about it), but very interesting and very tasty.  Sadly, though, that's where the greatness stopped. I ordered the smoked salmon omelet with the goat cheese and a side of sausages. It was, well, bland. The salmon wasn't very salmon'y, and the eggs weren't very egg'y. I don't know how to describe it other than \"blah\". Oh, and my sausages were shaped liked meatballs and were completely flavorless. What gives?  For a place that I've heard nothing but good things about, this one feel a bit flat. And even as I write this, I'm torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars (damn you Yelp and your lack of 1/2 stars). On the one hand, the bread and my girl friend's dish were delicious. On the other hand, I could make my dish better with very minimal effort. So I think I'm going to leave it as a 3-star rating but with the caveat that if you order the right things, you might well give it a higher rating.  Good luck in finding the right dish at this trendy, but underwhelming eatery.",

Because it was so busy, we had to wait another 20 minutes to order.  I had an omelet, which was okay I suppose.  The meal just wasn't memorable.  What does stick out in my mind, though, is how uncomfortable out seating arrangements were.  While the front of the restaurant seemed to have ample seating and room to the eat, the back room (where we were seated) is super cramped.  We were up against a window and I felt like the people dining behind us and to the side of us were actually at our table.  (Just to clarify, I'm a small woman and don't need much room to eat.)  After my one experience there, I'm not so sure what all of the hype is about.",

    "text": "After an incredible experience at Falling Water and Lautrec the night before it was back to The Burgh for more art, flowers, shopping, and food - waking up later than usual I decided to forgo the gym and after a quick shower the three of us made our way down to hipster/bohemian Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh for a breakfast I was told \"can't be beat.\"  Arriving at Coca Cafe just after 8am and finding free parking along the street we made our way in to the small shop to find only four tables full and only one server working.  Greeted pleasantly we were invited to sit wherever we like.  Speaking of tables and seats, they are probably the first thing anyone visiting Coca Cafe will notice.  Somewhere between yard-sale and antique store the restaurant features no less than 20 different styles of chair and everything from a small two top to a table that looks like something you'd find in your grandmother's kitchen.  Lining the wall with works of local artists, many of which were for sale, and filled with natural light the main room is fun and whimsical - so much that you can almost overlook the coffee, juice, and tea bar that dominates the right half of the space.  Greeted quickly by our server, an attractive and smiling young woman named Sharyn we were presented with menus and drink orders were placed - 2 coffees, one Almond Coca Moca and a subsequent hot tea for my sister, plus water.  I will note now that if Sharyn is not an owner or co-owner of Coca Cafe she deserves a BIG raise - making lattes, taking orders, bussing tables, running food from the kitchen, rolling napkins and silverware...I wouldn't have been surprised if she was cooking, as well - and even with all that our cups never reached empty.  Inside those cups - bold and balanced La Prima Coffee with free refills for $1.95 and Stash Tea for $1.25...a resounding bargain.  Orders placed we sat for less than fifteen minutes before our shared starter would arrive steaming hot from the kitchen.  Listed as \"Zucchini Bread - made with chocolate chips and coconut, served with fresh fruit\" this was unlike any Zucchini Bread I've ever had in that the bread was certainly made of well chopped zucchini - fibrous, moist, and full of nutmeg and cinnamon - but it was also loaded with shredded coconut and small chips of bitter dark chocolate giving it a \"Mounds Bar\" taste and texture.  Topped with a creamy butter this was a nice taste - it made me want to try the Banana Bread, as well.  When it came to main courses we ordered in predictable fashion - each ordering something different and sharing around.  Selecting first my mother, a fan of all things lemon, opted for the Almond French Toast - with fresh berries and lemon cream sauce.  While the dish certainly would not have been my first choice it actually turned out to be superb with thick and hearty rustic French bread cut at an angle, dipped in cream, vanilla, and cinnamon plus chopped almonds and pan fried crispy.  Topped with an ethereal cream sauce that tasted far too sweet to be called \"lemon\" (perhaps Meyer Lemon?) the whole dish felt light, summery, and fun.  For my sister's selection, the dish I'd originally targeted - Challah French Toast with brie, fig jam, and fresh berries.  Luscious and buttery the Challah on its own would have been delectable, but dipped in batter and griddled to crisp the bread was lovely.  Topping the bread first with heavy slices of creamy brie and then adding a smear of sweet fig compote plus a handful of strawberries and blueberries the dish was already wonderful, but a drizzle of maple syrup really brought out some of the mellow notes in the cheese.  For my main course, potentially the most interesting item on the menu - the Herbed Goat Cheese French Toast with country white bread stuffed with herbed goat cheese and topped with fresh berries.  Featuring three huge pieces of thick and airy bread, the slices were then cut diagonally and stuffed with rich and pungent chevre laden with basil, chive, salt, pepper.  With a hearty crust supporting the bread and earthy aromatics sandwiched within the bread was then dipped and pan seared to golden brown.  Topped simply with berries the whole concoction begged for a generous helping of pure maple syrup and when completed resembled the sort of sweet/savory interplay that one would expect from an Italian or Greek dessert course.  Full but not stuffed we settled the modest bill and left a well deserved tip for our outstanding \"do-it-all-and-do-it-well\" staff of one.  Making our way to the street and subsequently to Phipps Conservatory the meal at Coca Cafe was one of the best breakfasts I've had in some time and everything from the quirky decorations to unique selections to outstanding service were absolutely worth the trip.",

Let's start with the place--a fun, hip locale right in the heart of Lawrenceville. There are colorful tables with bright splashes of color all around. There is a room with more tables in the back, as well as a few tables outside on their patio.  There is a nice selection of food. Now I have only been there for breakfast, but I glanced at their lunch menu. Both breakfast and lunch have tasty selections who are also friendly to vegetarian/vegan needs. Both times I have had their challah french toast (anything with challah...oops almost said HOLLA! is delicious)  which is served with fresh berries. I felt like the prices were reasonable too.  Come check out this place! Definitely will be crowded on weekends so I recommend coming early, or on a week day if possible.",

    "text": "I was at a nearby bar with friends on Friday night and noticed that Coca Cafe is now open for dinner! We decided to try it out and it was quite possibly the best meal I have had over a year. I started with the Cauliflower Bisque with Truffle Oil - I am a sucker for anything with truffle oil, but this was hands-down the best soup I have ever had. The texture was perfect and the hint of truffle oil made it absolutely delectable.  I came with two friends, and the waitress recommended that we order 5-6 small plates. The menu is not extensive, but it was still difficult to narrow down the choices. We finally decided on the Spinach Salad, Crispy Pork Belly, the Focaccia Flatbread, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and the Crab Beignet (on special). All were great, but favorite was the Flatbread, which had the perfect (and unexpected) combination of butternut squash, goat cheese, smoked bacon, and arugula. I also very much enjoyed the Crab Beignet, which was like a crab cake, and the Spinach Salad, which was served with a mild blue cheese sauce, pear, and pancetta.   Since we couldn't decide one dessert, we ordered both the Chocolate Beignets with Salted Caramel Sauce, and the Pumpkin Cheesecake with Cinnamon Whipped Cream. Again, both phenomenal. The cheesecake was huge and the whipped cream was perfectly creamy and sweet with a hint of cinnamon. I do not typically enjoy chocolate pastries, but after trying one bite of a beignet, I couldn't help but finish it off. It was almost like a deep-fried dark chocolate brownie with salted caramel - yum!!  Since we didn't plan on coming here in advance, we couldn't take advantage of their BYOB, but I noticed it is only $5 per table. What a great deal! I'll be back VERY SOON.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  This is an addendum to my previous review. I had initially rated Coca 5-stars, but I updated it to 4 after my most recent visit. I had some of the same plates, but also ordered the shrimp and grits, as well as the pumpkin ravioli which was on special. The shrimp was a bit burnt, and the pasta was undercooked which made the ravioli tough to enjoy. All in all it was still a great meal and I will be back again, but I wasn't blown away like I was on my first visit.",

I rarely write Yelp reviews  cause every business has good and bad days but the staff and the quality has continued to go so, so down hill. I was rudely called out by one of the servers (maybe even owner) for bringing a cup of coffee in from a local shop  -- sorry I didn't finish it by the time the table opened, but glad I didn't cause by the time we put in an order I could've had like 3 cups anyways. Anyways, when you're paying $80 for a breakfast out with family its ok to have some expectations for your experience, that's why you go out. Ours wasn't good, the staff, the wait and quality was so underwhelming and for being a familiar face at an establishment and still being treated unkindly, is embarrassing on both ends.",

Since this friend had stayed in Pittsburgh after graduation and is the local now (and we'd already had Pamela's once that weekend) we decided to follow his advice. Good call!  Coca Cafe is exactly my kind of place, from the quirky decor to the gourmet twists on breakfast/brunch classics. The food is top-notch, fresh, with high-quality ingredients. Even the drinks are a little bit unique (like the lemon apple juice with a hint of ginger). Between 6 people we had 4 different dishes, and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Prices reflect the upscale quality, but they're not unreasonable. Service was fine, and parking wasn't too bad. (We found a spot around the corner on a side street.) If we lived in Pittsburgh, we would definitely be regulars at Coca Cafe.  Tip: Our friend suggested we either meet 15 min before they opened to get a seat right, or else 1 and 1/2 hrs later to avoid the first wave/rush. We chose the former, stood in line until the doors opened, and had no problem getting a table for 6. This was on a Sunday.",

A dozen or more sizably portioned entrees. Sides are a la carte. Quite popular. They put me on a waiting list and said they would text me when the first available table opened. No worries, I just walked down to this coffee shop down the street (espresso a mano, ill review it). Anyway, I had a coffee and waited for like 30 minutes before I got the text. We walked back down to Coco and they offered us a seat at the counter. 2 seats only. It was really perfect, because we kind of felt like we had the place to ourselves. We got constant coffee and water refills. We BSed with the waitress about the adult HP coloring books. I ordered an omelette with lox, avocado, and I was to say either cream cheese or mozzarella and it came with a side of potatoes and toast perhaps? Everything was highly cohesive. Totally unassuming place. Loads of natural light, well-spaced seating, yet cant be bigger than the living room and kitchen of your grandparents 1960 style ranch.",

Foodwise, their black coffee is very good (no bitterness, full bodied taste), but they don't seem to know how to do a good cappuccino. In fact, my black coffee was the best thing I had there.   A lot of omelets. I had the salmon omelette with herbs and goat cheese. It was good, but not remarkable. The same can be said of the egg benedict.

The only way we could resolve this was to go back two days in succession and liberally share our plates.

And I say that as somebody who normally strongly prefers savory breakfasts to sweet ones.  But the omelet (avocado and bacon) and the shrimp po'boy benedict (fried shrimp, poached egg, french bread, hollandaise) was improbably excellent.  There's no point in continuing to list-- everything else (toast, coffee, juice) was great too.  Just eat and enjoy.  Almost as important, the atmosphere is colorful and cheerful, the service is extremely friendly, and while the lines are long, they let you call in advance to put your name on the list.

The lady comes, gives us a SMUG look and says without even looking at us: \"an hour\". My boyfriend and I looked at each other and when we say thank you we're okay she seemed so glad and says yep, ok and turns around and leaves. We both felt extremely disrespected and will never go again, though it was our first time. I don't know if it was because I was wearing a headscarf or she's just rude in general. Will never recommend it and if I'm angry enough to write a bad review it means she REALLY messed up.",

Use Yelp to save your place in line and the 1+ wait to get in to this brunch spot can be done from home.  I treated myself to the lemon ricotta pancakes after a long run downtown and was not disappointed. Huge portions (I took half home) and cooked to perfection. The cold brew and maple sausage were also great. We'll be back!",

My friend got the cheesey omelette, potatoes, fruit, and a side of bacon.  It looked wonderful and she raved about it.  The omelette was HUGE, you will certainly not walk away hungry.  I got the curry chicken salad and a fruit bowl.  I must say, I would come back just to get this again.  It was spot on what I wanted.  the fruit bowl was also full of fresh fruit and another great portion. Service was friendly and I never wanted for a full water glass. The only negative I have about it was the time it took to be served.  It was...a noticeable while.  We didn't mind because we were there to catch up and chat, but if I was there because I was super hungry, I'd have gotten antsy. All in all would definitely go again and have to force myself to order something else because everything on the menu looked and sounded good.",

    "text": "I met a few friends at Coca Cafe for a birthday brunch on a Sunday morning. I had been a few years ago and didn't have a good experience. I checked Yelp reviews before going and it wouldn't have been my choice, but hey, it was his birthday.   So many things went wrong -- I'll try to stick to the things that matter most otherwise, you'll never get through this review. There were 6 of us and they sat 4 of us while we waited for the last two. I used to be in the service industry, so I get the annoyance with that whole situation.. HOWEVER; the waitress wouldn't even ask us for our drink order OR BRING US WATER. She avoided making any contact with us until we were 6/6, which happened at noon. She also wasn't familiar with the menu and couldn't answer any questions we had about it.   4/6 of us ordered Eggs Benedict and all of us were given eggs that were too hard. We explained this to the waitress and she took off coffees for 2 of the 4 of us that ordered coffees. But no mention of trying to make it right with the 2 that hadn't ordered coffee......  We also waited over an hour to get our food. Two other tables that placed orders after us were served first. Again, being in the service industry, I'm apprehensive to blame anyone because things happen, but I also know that this sometimes happens when the wait staff forgets to put the order in. No mention of what happened or even acknowledging that our food took that long ever happened. My issue a few years ago was the painfully slow service and after reading other reviews, I see our experience wasn't an isolated incident and it also is obvious this place doesn't care to make changes.   The waitress never refilled our waters and we ended up being there for two hours, including the hour we waited for our food. I had to flag her down after being given food because my knife was dirty. I was told they didn't have any clean knives because they were all in the dishwasher. Try eating Eggs Benedict without a knife.  A note about \"BYOB\" at some point this place became no longer BYOB, but the website still states it is. Our party came prepared to celebrate a birthday and instead were told of this change. At the time of this review, the website still states BYOB is $5/table.   The one nice thing was the atmosphere. The decor is interesting and there are a few larger tables, perfect for going with a group.   A few years ago, there were few brunch places in Pittsburgh, so you dealt with places like Coca Cafe. Now, there are SO MANY good places, don't settle for this place.",

    "text": "Coca Cafe is definitely a go-to for a great brunch in Pittsburgh.  The ingredients are always fresh, dishes imaginative, and staff can always keep their clientele comfortable during their busier times.  A few tips before you go: 1. You should always expect a wait time of at least 20 minutes.   It's a pretty buzzing place.  Once you arrive, you get to add your name to waitlist. Since it's a BYOB, I typically head up the hill to Arsenal Cider house (about a 6-8 minute walk) to grab something to have with brunch.  If you're lucky they even call you a little sooner. 2.  Try to get there early. Because everything is fresh, more popular dishes run out towards the end of their open-hours.  Whatever you order, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.   My boyfriend loves the corned beef has dish (which has been sold out a few times that we went).  I think the smoked salmon omelette is pretty good too.  In our most recent visit, I tried out their lunch menu.  I ordered a mushroom soup and a grilled cheese with 4 cheeses, tomato, and caramelized shallots.  The sandwich itself is pretty large since it's on sourdough, but as far as taste I was surprised by how average it was.  The soup however blew me away.  The mushroom soup was cream based, but not too creamy and filled with fresh mushroom pieces.  For the price, quality, and portions.  Coca Cafe is a definite win for the Lawrenceville area.",

The restaurant gives off a homey, diner feel and very charming. We ordered coffees and settled into make some food decisions.  I ordered an omelette and my boyfriend the challah French toast, highlighting only 2 meals out of the several. We all shared bites and everything we ordered was amazing and so reasonably priced!

They then proceeded to make us pack it ourselves (which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that the food was served in still hot cast iron skillets and we had no cutlery). When we got home - we realized they served us   1) Overcooked meats (fine) 2) Severely undercooked eggs (poor form especially since this purports to be a brunch place)  3) Raw sausage (OH.GOD.ITS.SO.RAW)   Disappointed to say the least.

The first and most important tip: download the Nowait app and use it.  You will absolutely have to wait at least 40 minutes to be seated and it is not a good situation if you are already hungry- this place WILL make you hangry. And trust me - the wait isn't worth it.  Service was ok- yes they were a little slow but the place was packed so it wasn't anything that I found unreasonable.The food was also just ok (anyone noticing a theme?!) it wasn't the rainbow unicorn exploding experience I thought would surely happen given the wait to get in. I had the goat sheesh stuffed French toast- which was unique at least.  Bottom line- if you have free time on a Sunday and you plan a little in advance, this place is a decent brunch but not worth starving yourself for.",

    "text": "I was so excited to finally have a chance to go to Coca Cafe for brunch, but the entire experience was a disappointment. I reserved our spot via 'no wait' and when we arrived on time, the hostess was rude and said we would have to wait another 20 min. Around 45 minutes later (and after checking in with her 2 times), we were finally seated. The hostess seemed pretty unhappy working there and talking to us, but she did express that something was wrong with the no wait app and that they were having issues all day. Either way, not a great way to kick off my brunch experience.   The experience I then had with our server was bizarre. He was just immature. That's the nicest thing I can say. As soon as we sat down, he went into how long it would take to get our food -- 45+ minutes, so we should order appetizers or starve. He was right about the wait. It took over an hour to get my eggs benedict and I estimated that I was there for almost three hours from start to finish. It was so hot inside the restaurant, and just sitting there for almost three hours was torture.   The food was mediocre and our server never checked on us. I had to hunt him down to get the check. Naturally, he never came to collect my money so I went to the front of the restaurant to find someone to pay. When I cashed out, I left my server the tip I felt he deserved. It was a $15 bill and I left him $2. I should have left him nothing because he was rude from the beginning and I saw him once during the entire brunch. I never leave a small tip and I never complain. It pains me to have to write this review but I was appalled at what happened next. When I handed him my receipt, he looked at my tip and called me out in the middle of the restaurant. He asked me why I didn't leave him a bigger tip. I tried to politely express my disappointment but he wouldnt let it go and he was loud. His response was that he has nine tables to serve. Wow. I was embarrassed with how unprofessional he was and just wanted to get out of there.   Several other people eating around us had the same experience. I just can't believe people actually revisit this place.",

For a Saturday morning, it was really busy, naturally. We had called ahead and our party still had to wait at least 30 minutes outside. Brisk, but sunny - we gathered around until our large party was able to be seated. The interior of this restaurant is cottage like, quaint and tight fitted tables and chairs. Best suited for a party of two, rather than a party of six.   If it weren't for the blackboard special that caught my eye, I would have ordered the Eggplant Benedict. The special was a plate of fresh corned beef hash (shredded and with gold potatoes), two perfectly sunny side up eggs, and piled on top... lightly fried pieces of kale. This dish was savory heaven. Others in our party, ordered the goat cheese stuffed french toast (whoa!), pesto omelette, shrimp and grits... All looked wonderful. We traded bites of things, and nothing disappointed me.",

Our waitress was superb, very helpful and attentive.  My only reason for staying away from Coca is the long lines, but if you go on a weekday, there should not be an issue.  I looked around, and everyone was having great conversations.  There ambiance is sunny and artsy.  I liked the art glass displayed around the restaurant.  Most of the negative review have been about the long waits, but I think the secret here is to go here when it's less crowded.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review. This used to be my favorite brunch spot in the city frequenting almost every weekend.   It has been a month since my last visit to Coco and I have debated sharing my experience.   The service staff is in desperate need of reform. The food amazing but the staff ruins the experience and for me it is a deal breaker.  The last time I went in for brunch I approached the service bar and requested a table for 2. I was told to wait by the door and someone would be with me shortly. There were plenty of tables. The hour long wait at Coco that I used to experience is no more. Possibly others have had similar experience. The staff seemed frazzled as they bustled around. A few minutes later another women came in and asked for a table for 2. She was seated immediately. This is the SECOND time this has happened to me at this restaurant. I calmly approached the bar and asked the women to explain to me their seating protocol. I thought maybe I didn't understand, maybe I missed the list, I don't know. She became irritable and shortly responded that the other women was there first. I explained that we were told to wait, the server that told me this over heard and confirmed. The women became red and continued to be defensive and argumentative. She was even rude to the other server! I couldn't believe it.  At this point I should have walked out. She dismissed the situation by responding \"we can seat you now\" and quickly walked toward another table.   I took a deep breath, let it go and stayed for the meal. I watched the interaction between staff members and other customers. It was unpleasant and frankly uncomfortable to see people treat others so poorly.   If the owners read this and I hope they do, please bring on some form of training in customer service. It is really sad to see this place slowly losing customers and gaining negative reviews due to a fixable issue. This review meant to be constructive and is written in hope of bringing about change.",

    "text": "First off, hats off to our server, who was really attentive and nice. My girlfriend and I stopped by the previous day to check the place out and he wisely advised us to download the \"inLine\" app which digitally allows you to reserve a place in line w/o physically being there. A great tip since, he advised us, the wait to get in can be up to an hour.  So we show up Sunday morning, and thanks to InLine, we were quickly seated. He took our orders with a smile and our coffees arrived pretty quickly.   That concludes the positive portion of this review.  Now for the negative, which is enormous. We proceeded to sit there for literally an hour, waiting for our food.  The waiter came by several times to tell us it would be out soon, but it still didn't arrive.    We looked around: there were five other tables full of people in our area of the restaurant. None of them had received any food. It was as if no cooking was being done in the kitchen *at all*.  Finally, at the 70 minute mark, I went up and tried to gently ask the cashier (who I'm told is also the owner) when we could expect to be served. She interrupted me and snippily assured me a 45min to an hour wait was \"normal on the weekend.\" Interesting. I wonder why, then, we weren't told that before we were made to wait for an hour? Also, it had been *over* an hour.   I dropped payment for coffees and tip on the table, and my girlfriend and I split. Our other companions remained. Their food arrived 15 additional minutes later, and one dish had a hair in it. Needless to say they, and I, won't be returning.    By the way, about 15 minutes earlier we'd seen another angry conversation between the cashier and another customer, who also walked out. Dunno what it was about, but let's say I wasn't seeing lots of smiling places in the establishment that afternoon.  PS: check other recent one-star reviews for Coca, complaining of the same problem. This joint appears to melt down on the weekends. There are several other brunch spots in the immediate neighborhood. Try those.",

One of the waitresses who seemed very annoyed waved us over and her eyes practically rolled back in her head. They sat us at a table in the back and there was one glass of water on the table and they brought over one fresh glass and set it in front of me. I asked if the water on the table was left from a previous table and the same rude waitress rolled her eyes again and said \"um we preset the tables\". We decided we didn't want to give them our business. You've been open for half an hour and there are many tables open, you aren't in the weeds and you haven't just worked a crazy brunch shift yet. It's a little early in the game to be that rude.",

I got there a little early and was approached by kind of a rude server. She wasn't rude per se, but she did seemed stressed with how many people were there. She told me I wasn't allowed to wait in there because there wasn't any room and basically kicked me out. I've never been to Lawrenceville, so I wasn't familiar with the area at all. It seems like a cool neighborhood though with a lot of outside shops. Unfortunately, it was snowing/raining so I really didn't want to be outside. Where was I supposed to go? I ended up just walking down the street to a chocolate place, but I was just annoyed. If it gets that busy, why not expand so you can add a waiting area for all your customers? Oh well. We ended up getting seated and to be honest, the food was just eh. I don't even remember what I got...I think it was the brunch burger. With all the hype it gets, it's not a very memorable place. It's definitely a cute little family, hipster restaurant, so I'd go back there to try it out again.",

    "text": "I wish I had read some of these reviews prior to walking in last week.   My folks were flying in from NY to join me during the 'pleasure' part of a business trip. I wanted to get out of my downtown hotel and explore a bit before heading to pick them up at the airport. My friend, who is now in the Manchester neighborhood, used to live in Lawrenceville, so I decided to check it out.   There were plenty of places to eat walking along Butler Street. But I continued walking, past the bridge to see if there was anything else, esp the eggs I was craving (one nice place was more about pancakes, so I kept going). I liked how this place felt, so I went in. Since I had been walking around for a while and only had coffee at my hotel earlier, I was hungry.   The woman who greeted me was pleasant and said I could sit wherever. At first, I chose a spot in the back, but it was a wobbly table over an AC vent, which was not pleasant on this cloudy, cool morning. So, I asked to sit up front and was accommodated. I sat down, without a menu or anything for quite a while. When the server/host (possibly owner?) came by again with the menu, I made the mistake of ordering more coffee. Because I then sat and sat with an acidic, empty stomach for a good long time before I could place my order. The server was MIA a lot. When she did show up, I ordered the poached eggs with burrata and roasted beets. And there I sat...and sat....and finally realized others were sitting there a good long time, too. When the server came out to take drink orders from another table (who were also unattended for a while), I was about to ask her what was up with the food, when someone else came out with it.   While tasty, the poached eggs were not runny. They were solid; most probably cooked themselves while sitting on counter waiting to get picked up (because it wasn't that warm anymore). I was disappointed, but at this point, I just wanted to fill my belly and go. So, with a full plate in front of me, since the MIA server was in the dining area, I made a point to ask for the check. It came, though it also took a bit of time.  When I left, it was quietly, without any call of 'thanks'. But for all I know, the server was once again MIA - I didn't bother to turn back to see.",

If they do takeout, call ahead before you're actually hungry so when you get to the restaurant and they tell you it's going to be a 15-20 min wait you don't end up getting hangry.  *** If you have 2-3 hours to kill, money to burn and can't think of what to do, I would definitely eat breakfast at Coca.",

I always give my friends a head up about the wait for food. The first time I came I waited at least thirty mins and had to ask the waitress what's going on. Everytime after that, yup there is indeed always a long wait to get our food.  I will come here if I have plenty of time to kill and also if im not too hungry.

Want a drink? Have to ask for a menu, and have to ask at least twice for whatever you order. No breaking up the bill, everyone has to go up to the counter to go through who ordered what, review the bill again, correct whatever else is still off. And, my favorite, I asked for a to go box for the rest of my food (which was actually very good other than that they equate avocado with guacamole, so enjoy your guacamole toast) and they, without telling me they did not have to go boxes, simply put my food into a cardboard box that some bar bottles had been delivered in, put it in a plastic bag and sent me on my merry way. Nothing better than getting home and seeing your food sitting in the bottom of the what is essentially bar trash. Just tell someone you can't pack up the food to go.",

    "text": "Even though I am only just reviewing the Coca Cafe, let it be known that I have been here probably about 10 times in the past year. Every time I want to go to brunch with someone, I take them to the Coca Cafe. My mom does the same because we love this place so much!! The food is just downright delicious, and the restaurant itself is so cute! The furniture is eclectic and the rooms are tightly packed, but the space is bright with natural light and super inviting.  For food, they always have a nice variety of sweet and savory brunch options - some sort of pancake, waffle, or French toast, some omelettes, and a few other breakfast staples like eggs benedict. However, each dish is crafted with fresh, innovative combinations of ingredients, and as a result, everything is very unique. The flavor profiles in each dish are deep and rich. Despite the unique combinations of ingredients, I have never tried anything that I haven't liked! Additionally, they are constantly rotating their menu to include new specials. Sometimes, these only last for one day (for example, special dished that they craft specifically for Sunday brunch), while others are seasonal (like pumpkin pancakes in the fall/winter). Even though I've been so many times, there is always something new on the menu to try out.   While the food is on the pricy side, I think it's worth it. However, it is definitely (easily) possible to spend a good $20+ on brunch, especially if you get a dish that involves seafood or one of their fresh squeezed juices. I think that it's totally worth the money, but it's certainly not the most budget friendly spot.   One other consideration is the wait - if you go on a busy day (weekends), expect a long wait. In fact, if you don't call ahead/use open table/etc, you should expect to wait at least an hour. Again, I think it's worth it, but I have had to wait for at least an hour and a half before. Using something like open table alleviates this problem, but you do have to plan ahead. Also, if you do get stuck with a long wait, the restaurant is located on Butler Street, which is full of shops that you can explore to pass the time! Or, if you want to grab a coffee, pop down a block to Espresso a Mano, one of my favorite Pittsburgh coffee spots.   Overall, despite the cost and wait, I will continue to go to the Coca Cafe time and time again, because you cannot beat the quality and deliciousness of the dishes that they create!",

After searching on Yelp for customer reviews as well as food (I mean duh who doesn't do that) we thought it would be a great place to visit. We arrived at 5 minutes after nine and were promptly seated. It took 15-20 minutes before our waitress came to the table. We were a little confused considering the restaurant opened at 9 and they were not super busy. After she finally came to the table she gave one menu. It took another 10 minutes for her to come back and we ordered our food and drinks. After waiting for a total of one hour we asked how much longer? She responded I don't know. We replied can you check? She said sure. After she came back she said there were 5 tables ahead of us and she had no idea how long it was going to take because they were large parties. We responded ok well 30 minutes and hour? She replied I don't know. We asked for the check because we were hangry af! When we got the bill they charged for our food and drink even though they hadn't even started making our food. My boyfriend said ummmm we aren't paying for the food. Then another lady came over and said we are really busy on Saturday and Sunday and we have a small kitchen. Moreover, we can only handle two orders at a time. We said ok well we want to leave. After we checked out we realized the people that walked in with us were leaving as well but they had already ate. Would never go back again. Consider expanding your kitchen or getting chefs that can cook faster.",

Everything tasted so fresh and authentic, there were several types of cheese in the omelette and you are able to taste each and every flavor individually. The bacon was thick and cooked perfectly and was only $1 more to add, a pretty solid deal! It came with toast which was good though cooked a little hard for my taste and a cup of fruit which was very fresh and tasty. The service was friendly and prompt as well. For those who like a morning adult beverage they have a wonderful selection of bloody Mary's and mimosas. As a coffee drinker myself, I do prefer a breakfast spot with more variety in that realm, which if it existed was not offered or on the menu. Still the omelette alone is worth coming in for, and overall its just a cute spot for a breakfast bite, you won't be disappointed",

I ordered the quinoa breakfast bowl, which was a little bland (mostly just plain beans and quinoa), but a generous portion, and curable with hot sauce. If it had been a little (temperature) hotter, the entire dish would have probably been better.   My other friends ordered the Coca Breakfast Sandwich and Avocado Omelet, which I tried both of, and they were packed with significantly more flavor. The sandwich is definitely the best move if you're looking for a unique experience of taste bud excitation. It's like no other breakfast sandwich I've had.",

    "text": "Was here from Los Angeles visiting my brother and this was where we had breakfast on my last day in town. Honestly, we would have been better off getting McDonald's. Here's what happened and why you should avoid this place: we arrived at 9:35am and were very excited to get a table for four right away. Unfortunately, the service thereafter was the worst I've ever experienced. And I mean, ever, in any context. We were first asked what we wanted to drink 35 minutes after we sat down. I decided to bypass a further delay by ordering plain coffee, thinking that all cafes, no matter how slow on food/service, are pretty good with the coffee. Nope. 15 minutes later, our waitress brought 2 cups of coffee, a latte and a juice, clutching them in one hand, spilling the latte all over the table in front of me. She didn't clean it up, didn't apologize, and I had to ask a different waitress for additional napkins.   When we placed our drink orders, we'd also ordered food: chocolate donut holes with salted caramel sauce, and fried burrata in tomato sauce to share; 2 club benedicts; 1 fried burrata, spinach and roasted tomato benedict; and one combination of side dishes (bacon, soy sausage, berries, potatoes). We asked how many donut holes came with the order - 3 - and then the waitress told us she could give us four so there would be one for each of us. We were pleased with this dull glimmer of awareness of what customer service should be, and thanked her.   Finally - oh, how long had it been? An hour and ten minutes? - the shared items arrived, after a waitress tried to deliver them to tow other tables. Shocker, we only got 3 donut holes. And when someone brought us plates, literally every one of the four of them was dirty and had food on it. We asked one of the waitresses for clean plates and she said of course, then noticed we'd only gotten the 3 donut holes and said she'd have them bring another right away. By the time the clean plates arrived (an interval long enough that my brother wondered aloud if it would be rude of him to go wash the plates himself and come back with them), the burrata dish had cooled. Not only that, but the waitress who brought them was chewing on food - I'd guess chocolate donut holes with caramel sauce - with her mouth very, very open while she handed us the plates. That image unfortunately stayed with me through the meal.   So, here goes on the quality of the food, since lots of the reviews of this place say that service is terrible but food is amazing. Let me disabuse you of that notion: the food is not amazing; it's not even very good. Donut holes: uncooked in the middle, which, given how unclean everything was, didn't make me feel great. Club benedicts: supposedly came with avocado, but none to be seen; bread tasted stale; hollandaise not good. One of these went entirely uneaten. Potatoes: dry, bland. Fruit: soggy. Mine was the burrata benedict, which I'd ordered with salad but which came instead with potatoes. When they brought the salad, it was chock full of inedible bits of old, soggy spinach and other greens. Maybe it was seeing all that food in the waitress' mouth; maybe it was the uncooked donut holes? But I couldn't make it through the dish. Had a few bites and decided I'd done what I could. It was a relief to leave, even knowing I was headed to the airport - at least I can operate with the assumption of poor quality in an airport restaurant... now you can operate with the same assumption about this place.  As you can see, I don't write a lot of yelp reviews. What I'm trying to convey here is that you should seriously save yourselves and your $$ and go elsewhere.",

Atmosphere - Hipster coffee shop with people being hipsters, busy, vibrant, friendly, wait staff even said \"dude\"...but apologized (not sure why)... it made me chuckle.     Food - Many a great choice here on the menu but being that I had eaten a copious amount of cookies over the past holiday weekend I thought I would be healthy by opting for the egg white omelet.  The omelet came w/ spinach, cherry tomatoes, feta, and a side of pumpernickel bread.  The dish was just okay.  Maybe it was too healthy, as there was little flavor present.  Maybe they cook it with a spray and not butter.  Who knows...  To drink I had an unsweetened ice tea which tasted weak or maybe my years in the South w/ strong brewed tea has ruined me.    Service - The service was great as the server was engaging despite it being busy.  There were no faults here.  Overall - I would like to give this place another try at a time when I haven't eaten my weight in cookies the weekend before...then it will be French toast time!!",

Half of the specials were sold out when we ordered. Half an hour into the wait, the waitress told us they sold out on the plate I ordered. And on bacon ordered for our child. No apologies were offered. Nor discount. I ordered a different plate and requested it be brought with the rest of the order. Ten minutes later another staff (manager?) came to our table and told us that they did have bacon and the original plate I ordered! No apologies for the mixed messages and confusion were offered. We pointed out how unacceptable this service was to us. To be asked to change an order for the second time 40 minutes after ordering. The staff started screaming at us, mentioned being overworked, and asked us rudely and loudly  \"do you want the plate yes or no?!\" Then stomped into the kitchen. We decided at that moment to leave. Went to pay for the coffee we ordered. When we told the cashier their service and confusion was unacceptable, instead of apologizing, she told us she was not interested in our opinion and asked us to leave immediately. In disbelief, we reminded her to be professional. She started screaming at us to leave immediately, insulted us, involved our child in the discussion, and threatened to call the police if we didn't leave immediately. We were stunned and in disbelief at this woman flipping out and treating us with such disrespect. Finally a third staff intervened and told her to calm down. No apologies to us were given. We have never encountered such horrible customer service and disrespect. Reading previous reviews before writing ours only reaffirms that our experience is not an isolated one. Strongly recommend you avoid this place and enjoy the multiple and better alternatives available in the area. We had to give this restaurant one star in order to publish this review. Yet Coca Cafe gets 0 stars from us.",

After 45 mins we went in to ask the waitstaff and were told that 5 more tables were ahead of us! After another 45 mins we ask what's going on and they said they called us and apparently someone told them we were on our way and never showed up. Anyways, they were able to seat us 10 mins later. Luckily we knew what we wanted ahead of time and put in our omelette orders and coffee. 10 mins go by and the coffee wasn't there. We ask the waitress for the coffee and she said \"didn't I bring you your coffee\" No you didn't or else the coffee cups would be on the table!   Waiting for our food now. I'll finish my review after...  We got our food and it turns out the Salmon Omelette and Avocado Omelette with toast was very good.  Unfortunately the poor service ruined what would have been a restaurant I would suggest friends go to.  I really only gave it 2 stars or maybe even 2.5 stars because of the very good food... the restaurant itself gets less than 2 stars.

Fabulous combo of sweet and savory! Genius!!! I give 5 stars for the goat cheese French Toast!!! I almost gave up on trying it when our waitress forgot to bring my order but I'm so glad I didn't!!  Although I was already full from Challah French toast which was dry and not memorable enough, and from just \"A-OK\" avocado omelette, I decided to wait for another 10 minutes because I chose this cafe specifically for this goat cheese french toast!!! I wasn't going to give up easily because not only I spent 30 minutes on Yelp website trying to find a cool  brunch place in this small town where \"non-Sunday brunch\" is a foreign concept (we came on Saturday morning), but also I drove all the way from NJ (6.5 hrs!!) to meet my BFF in Pittsburgh, and the chance of me returning here is very unlikely especially now that my BFF is moving back to the West Coast. My patience paid off!!! However, I can't believe how much I ate in one sitting..... I probably consumed like 2000 kcal!! DOH!   Check it out if you are in Pittsburgh. It's located in relatively more hip and artsy part of the town, and the cafe itself is cozy and reminds me of cafes in Lower East Side/East Village. Although the waitress forgot my order, she was nice and polite, and she rushed my order for me. They also serve good cappuccino too!",

Results may vary for brunch, lunch, etc.  I was initially very excited to see the range of offerings on the dinner menu:  Small plates meant to be shared with items ranging from pork belly to duck ragout to good ol' shrimp and grits.  My party chose around 5 of these to try.   The idea was great but the execution was, sadly, lacking.  The risotto was crunchy and undercooked (ditto for the pappardelle noodles).  Pork belly was flabby, not crispy.  The poutine was the best option but low on cheese curds.    The ideas are great and have potential but for the moment perhaps it's better braving the brunch crowds here instead...",

I thought the stuffing was the right amount and the savory flavors really went well with sweetness of French toast.   The fresh juice is small and expensive, but it really is fresh and it really is tasty. The cucumber spritzer was too thick for me. Too much cucumber. It didn't taste much like a drink. Needs more spritz.   The salmon sandwich with bacon was also incredible. It was a great portion. The side salad that accompanied it was also very fresh and crunchy.

    "text": "We went here on Saturday for breakfast and it was the perfect pick.  Although the restaurant was packed, we didn't wait very long. After we were seated and looked thru the menu, we decided on Smoked salmon omelette, Herbed goat cheese french toast and the Challah french toast, side orders of sausage and maple bacon.  Yes. there were a lot of food, but we ate all of it!  The salmon omelette was very good with lemon with it.  The herbed goat cheese french toast was an acquired taste, but the best was Challah french toast. It was the perfect combination of fig jam and brie. Maple bacon is a must try.  We don't live in Pittsburgh, but hubby still mentions every now and then about the fig and brie french toast and the maple bacon.    Service is wonderful and we would go to Coca every weekend if we live in Pittsburgh.",

Or maybe it just doesn't taste worth 12-15 bucks for plate of eggs and bread after waiting for what was supposed to be 20 minutes but agonizingly turned into 50.     This past time I got the challah french toast with melted brie and fig spread, which sounds awesome.  When I got it it had a little sliver of brie in the corner of each of the four huge chunks of bread, and was smothered in the jam.  In hindsight I should of sent it back and been like, uh the brie was the main highlight and there's barely any but I was so hungry and wanted to get the hell out of there so I let it go.    There were babies crying, people whining and overall, not a nice Sunday morning brunch spot.   My friend got the grits with eggs over easy atop Swiss chard with pancetta and grits with a delicious Spanish cheese, and everything on her plate was great, except the eggs were sort of \"snotty.\"     I bet it's better on a weekday, but do not go for a weekend brunch.",

    "text": "If I'm in line before the restaurant opens and it takes 40-75 minutes for my table to be ready, my standards rise to \"this better be the best meal ever in the history of mankind.\"  After waiting in said line a half dozen times, I'll given Coca Cafe a solid meh.  I don't get the hype.  THE WAIT:  Seriously, plan for a 40-75 minute wait even if you show up 15 minutes before it opens.  On the plus, they will text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait outside the door.  This would be somewhat okay if it didn't take another 45-70 minutes to get food after being seated.  I'm all for ready-made food, but don't seat someone and then make them wait an hour for a mediocre omelet.    THE DRINKS: Eh.  I was unimpressed by the chai latte--not spicy enough.  The raspberry soda was pretty good.  The cappuccino tasted burnt.  And, the kicker, the one time I just ordered hot tea, the water was lukewarm and I had to ask for hotter water--and I hate being that person who complains about water temperature.  I'd stick with the Italian sodas.  THE SERVICE: Pretty good, other than the insanely long wait.  Once, we came back after 90 minutes and were like, \"Seriously?!\"  And the girl at the door had lost our number and given up our spot 15 minutes before that.  We were seated next, but an apology would have been nice.  Otherwise, the servers were good.  THE FOOD:  Let's start with lunch, which is the meal on the shorter end of the wait.  The California Cobb salad was fine--it was everything you could hope for in a salad.  The spinach and artichoke tart needed something--spice, sour cream, I don't know...but it was pretty bland.  On to breakfast.  The omelets let me down.  Never before in my life had I said, \"I should add more salt to this.\"  Never.  When I'm baking, I usually put in much less salt than called for or none at all.  But, man, do their omelets need kick.  Both the avocado and the four cheese required salt and pepper.  Either would have also benefited from cilantro, but that's just my opinion.  Now, the herbed goat cheese French toast is the only menu item I've ordered more than once.  It's excellent.  Is it worth $8 and having to wait a total of 2 hours and 25 minutes?  Nope.  Was the fruit fresh?  No, the blueberries were wrinkled.  I solved that by re-creating the recipe at home.  I do thank Coca for the inspiration, and that's why it was worth two stars.  I won't ever need to wait in line again.  ETC:  The restaurants seats around 40.  The one-stall bathroom is right in the middle of the front room.  This is weird for two reasons.  First, there's usually a short line of people pressed up against the table closest to it.  Do you like people doing standing over you doing the pee dance while you're eating?  Me neither.  Second, you can HEAR people peeing while you're eating at said table.  I actually have terrible hearing, so if I can hear it, others can too.  It's gross.  Overall, I was pretty bummed that it wasn't better.  I kept hoping that at some point it would live up to my expectations, but it never came close.  So long, Coca.",

Not including the fact my husband's work had an event catered by them which was equally fabulous. Thus, I recommend dinning in and catering out!  I've only eaten their breakfast menu, while dinning in. I've had the roasted vegetable omelet and the wild mushroom omelet. Omelet's are served with your choice of bread:cinnamon, seven grain, herbed focaccia, pumpernickel or country white toast. My choice both times was the cinnamon- which is amazing. Not too much cinnamon sugar with a pad of butter was the perfect combination. One the third occasion I ordered a freshly prepared (one can here the vitamix at work!) carrot orange ginger juice which was exuberantly fresh and tangy.  The staff are very polite and mindful of refills, the removal of plates, and prompt timing of providing a check. If you enjoy simply, healthy foods showcased in their perfect freshness while being reasonably priced- this is the place to go. Their is ALWAYS a line waiting to get into to this place on weekend mornings. After eating there you will soon find out why! Enjoy =)",

I got the wild mushroom omelet with brie and while the mushrooms were fresh and tasty and the egg part of the omelet was well prepared (light and fluffy) the cheese just didn't do it for me.  It needed something sharp, spicy or zesty to compliment the mushrooms but the brie lacked on that front.    I felt like I was dousing the omelet with salt left and right, which in my opinion isn't the best sign for the taste of the food.  It means there's either something lacking or that you're trying to cover something up.    I may come here again, but it probably won't be top on my list.",

Really struggling because it should be a 3.5 ... but I will go back to reassess - but for now:   They were out of their brunch specials, but we came in late for that anyway - they close at 3, and it was already 2:30. Shame.   I had an apple-cheese-cranberry-panini; which was less panini and more like toasted cheese with apples. The bread was good; light and fluffy, and everything seemed fresh. The side of potatoes was perfect. Came with a side of fruit that was pretty lame, but it is January, so whatever ... strawberries aren't exactly in season.    The brunch buddy had the gigantor goat cheese 'stuffed' french toast (literally, the three pieces of bread had to be a loaf) and a side of the sage sausage (which were like little patty-nuggets), and apparently they weren't too 'sagey,' but I'm guessing that's an a-okay thing. The french toast was served with syrup, which it did need - otherwise, it would have been super dry - but Aunt Jemima and goat cheese? I feel like it deserves a little more creativity. Oh, and I hate syrup.   Service was fine; we only had one menu and a server took a few minutes to come over (and I don't think she even offered another). We waited a bit after ordering one of the carrot juices (not sure what else was in it, but it tasted predominately carrot).",

Well, that is exactly what happened.   My friends and I wanted brunch on a lazy Saturday, but we were all so lazy as to not actually want to be in public eating, so we ordered take-out from Coca Cafe. We all figured out our orders, and then one person called in. We just did separate orders for each person, so that we could all walk over an pay separately without a problem. Not so.   After giving my friend a hard time on the phone when he was making the order, we were treated rudely at the restaurant when we were picking up the order. When we were on our way out, another cashier felt the need to reprimand us again for the way that we were paying them. ARE YOU KIDDING!? Please do not complain about the WAY that we are paying you. They were not even busy.  If they are gonna be that bitchy about splitting checks then they should probably list explicitly that they prefer certain ways of payment. It really kinda ruined our experience.... feeling shitty as we leave the restaurant, just happy not to be in those ladies' presence any longer.   But when we took the food home, I must admit that it was delicious. I had Challah french toast, and it was yummy. I guess their kitchen is awesome with horrible service, which is so unfortunate because I am not so sure I will suffer through that again for the good food.",

    "text": "Dinner review. This is a high 4 with an option to upgrade to 5 in the future. Good place to go for dinner before going to the Gray Box Theatre just down the street.  Once I placed my order, they started me off with cranberry brie biscuits with molasses pomegranate butter, very tasty.  The soup that evening was curried acorn squash and corn bisque with lump crab and crispy dandelion greens, a religious experience.   Fede pumpkin mascarpone ravioli, with brussels (I think), mushrooms, white wine leek sauce, and fried sage. Very good, although there was something in there with a too-chewy texture, probably the brussels. Perhaps 6 ravs, but generous sauce. Well, they did say small plates.   Pumpkin cheesecake with graham cracker crust, greek yogurt, local honey and fried sage: tasty, tasty, tasty, definite pumpkin flavor, and not overly sweet. I thought I would be annoyed at the sage but it went very well with the pumpkin.  Despite my concern about the size of the ravioli dish, I was more than full and couldn't finish the cheesecake.  Friendly service. Coffee house ambiance.   I'm gonna check good for breakfast, lunch, brunch because they serve it but I've only been there for dinner. But I would absolutely go there for brunch.",
