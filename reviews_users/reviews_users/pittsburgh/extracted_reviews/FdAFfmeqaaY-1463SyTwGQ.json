The waitress is exactly what you expect in a diner - overworked, but she hustles.  The food is just the way I like it.  Over medium eggs perfectly cooked, home fries are plentiful and the bacon is the best.  The breakfast sandwich, when I order it, gets eaten for both breakfast while I'm there, and for my take-along lunch as well.  It's huge and delicioius!  Please do not jazz this place up.  It's perfect as it is.",

The pancakes themselves were great.  Admittedly the whole thing was delicious, but I tend to go for higher quality ingredients in my food.  The service wasn't great, either.",

    "text": "This is a really basic place with a fairly large menu.  They serve breakfast, burgers and sandwiches, and I think most people could find something to eat on the menu.  I ordered the cheese steak and it was very good. And just so cheesesteak purists know, it came with your choice of cheese (rather than cheese whiz), with peppers, onions, and mushrooms, on a crusty sandwich bun.   Our waitress was exceptonally rude. I actually thought it was quite fun. One of the people I was with asked for mayonaisse and she threw the packets onto the table, scattering them all over my place.  She also discouraged questions about the menu, and I thought she was going to lose it at one point, though there was only one other table during lunch time on a Friday. They have a lunch special that offers your choice of an entree with a drink and fries for $6.00.  I asked for no fries, so the waitress charged me $0.50 extra, presumably since it wasn't *really* the special.  Instead of questioning the logic behind this, I took the $0.50 out of her tip.  At the end of our meal, the cook (and maybe the owner?) came over to say hello and to thank us for coming in, which was nice of him, though he kept looking down my shirt.  So maybe it wasn't so nice of him. Another plus is that they serve both Coke and Pepsi products.  There really is something for everyone here, and I'd probably go again for breakfast. In a turtle neck. And only if I was in a decent mood.",

All made to order, not not precooked like you's find at other places. Great service with no pretensions! Over-easy eggs, sausage, real home fries, pancakes -- all for about $8. Coffee was good, too.

The English muffins are flown in upon order from England...that is, I assume such since it didn't make its appearance until I was paying the check. The soup was blah...I never really got to taste it because it defied the 2nd law of thermodynamics as it never chilled.

It seemed like they had enough staff, but what they were all doing, I'm not sure. So I finally got my over-easy eggs (yolks already broken), bacon (crunch, crunch) and potatoes (eh). Oh, the toast was good. I was so hungry, I didn't even care at that point.  So, I finished the meal and waited, waited, waited for my check. Thankfully, it was fairly inexpensive.

One of our diners ordered a sandwich that didn't say it had cheese but did come with it, which was fine but unexpected.

    "text": "Note-NO credit cards allowed. This is a CASH ONLY establishment.   I've passed this place a bunch of times whilst Downtown. Today I had to bus it, and considering it hadn't been reviewed yet, I thought I'd give it a try.   Today was another first for me.   I'll give ya a hint. I ate them as opposed to kissing them.   Eh, so much for hidden 80's TV references. I had grits!  \"Please sir may I have some more.\"  Nah not really.   Gru-uuu-el.   I was in \"Oliver!\" in junior high. Sorry.  My father always told me that grits reminded him of Cream of Wheat, and he was right to think that. Butter and salt didn't help. They were just bland. Hopefully this is just a bad example of the suvvern staple, but I saw them on the menu and had to go for it y'know?  Considering that there was so much I wanted to try, I ate big.  So I also got a Kitchen Sink Omelet. 3 eggs, peppers, homefries, American Cheese, and bacon (all within the omelet itself), with white toast, and it was damn fine. It's been a while since I had an omelet that good.   Now for my \"dessert.\" Hey, pancakes are dessert to me ok?  I thought the name \"Cherries\" referred to a woman's name.   Nope, these people have a cherry fetish, which is preferable to having an errr... shoe fetish, infinitely better.   Anyway, they unleashed The Cherry Bomb Pancake! It's like a crepe, but long and  fat, stuffed with cherries and topped with whipped cream.   This is why I consider pancakes dessert. It almost tasted like a shortcake. What a reward.   And get this, after all I ordered, which included a water and an OJ, my bill was 13 bucks and change.  The omelet was $6, the pancake $4, and I would have been satisfied with just one or the other; this place is a non-profit!   If you need a good, quick breakfast on the cheap, ignore McDonald's and come here for some home cookin'.  And they serve burgers and lots of different sandwiches too, even wings, so go for lunch also. There's no excuse for fast food.",

It was a faint smell- so faint, in fact, that I barely recognized and indeed said to my co-worker \"you know what they need in Market Square? You know what would make this THE downtown Mecca or food? An all-American, good old, greasy spoon diner.\"  \"Have you been to Cherries?\" Inquired the co-worker.  \"Alas... I've not. What is that place? And more importantly... do they serve bacon?\"  Cherries is the perfect little hole-in-the-wall greasy plate, get your day started right kind of a place. Everything about this place is near-perfect: The coffee is good, the forks are cheap, there is a small counter, and a TV playing the Today Show that no one is really watching, and the staff is three old people, who are constantly bickering and fighting. I once heard the waitress (the one one in there) say to another customer \"you can order that if you want, but it'll take a long time. He [i'm assuming the cook] hates making that and he is already in a terrible mood.\" It was at this point that the cook poked his head out of the kitchen and yelled sometime indeterminate and the waitress said \"see? So what else do you want.\"  I'm not giving this 5 stars because the food is good, but not AMAZING... but then again, it isn't supposed to be! Also the coffee comes in a styrofoam cup, not a mug and it can get crowded in the small space. Be sure to carve out an hour for breakfast... it may not take that long, but it certainly is a possibility.",

Came off extremely rude the way she was in such a hurry. She looked at me crazy when I said I wanted my bacon deep fried. Where I'm from (south central PA) this is common to get bacon truly crispy. Anyway, I got the special for $6.99. 2 eggs, homefries, bacon, and 1 pc of French toast. Everything was prepared ok but the potatoes. They were chunky, soggy, and greasy, probably were sitting awhile. Stuff was not made to order but the eggs...I waited like 5 min. for my entire order. Maybe I'm spoiled. I grew up on diner food because my mom was a server. This diner was not anything I was used to. Not to mention, where I live, you can get 2 eggs, homefries, and toast for $1.99.

    "text": "Originally I was going to try a burger at Wingharts in Market Square for lunch today but when I got there it was closed with a sign on the door that read,  \"Temporarily Closed Due To Fire\". Still hankering for a burger,  I looked around and decided to give Cherries Diner a try.   Cherries is all that you would expect from a \"diner\" in appearance,  atmosphere and service; It has that \"50's\" nostilogic speak and I was greeted promptly and cheerfully. I decided to go with the Cheeseburger Bacon Combo Special (comes with fries and a can of pop). My burger came in less then ten minutes.    Everything seemed great and I was enjoying the whole experience. I wanted to give this place a great review but the burger was nothing to rave about. There was nothing terribly wrong with it mind you, but it was simply bland; the burger, the lettuce, the tomato and the bun where all virtually tasteless.   Even the bacon lacked flavor. A Mickey Dee's quarter pounder has more flavor than the burger I had... It's hard to image how they do that!   I really wanted to like this place and I still want to like this place.  I plan on going back sometime soon just to try something else (maybe the chicken steak or the grilled sausage or the fish or maybe even breakfast) and maybe boost the rating.  I'm giving it a generous 3 stars simply because the service deserves it.",

    "text": "I am not so sure where all this negativity is coming from for this place.  I'm in love with it.  It's gritty, it's cramped, it's greasy and it's everything I imagine a diner to be when placed in a downtown area.  In fact, I think that's what gives this place it's charm.  When you think diner, you picture one that they depict in movies or television shows.  One where the wait staff is quick with their wit, maybe a bit sarcastic too.  One where you want to smell the grease from the cooking in the back.  And even though Cherries doesn't have the typical diner look on the inside, it has a very unique look to define itself.  When I walked in here, it was after the morning rush.  It was dieing down inside and it made for pretty quick service for me.  The waitress I got greeted me with a 'I'm late for my cigarette break' look, and a voice to match.  The order was sent to the back and I paid promptly after wards and just sat at the counter and waited.  While I waited, I thought the price I paid was a bit steep for the item I ordered.  I had ordered a breakfast sandwich and nothing more.  What I got was one huge honking sandwich.  It's was the equivalent of two or three breakfast sandwiches at any other place in the area.  When I pulled the sandwich out of the bag and it was wrapped in it's aluminum foil glory.  I truly did feel like I was on a movie set diner.  The toast was perfectly toasted.  The eggs were cooked to griddle perfection and the sausage patty was by far one of the best I have ever had.  It should be noted, that like most small eateries and restaurants in the downtown area, they have a 3 o'clock closing time.  So you do need to be in the downtown area fairly early to enjoy this place.  Credit cards are accepted.  And this, my friends, makes my 400th review!",

The menu (including breakfast and lunch options) is pretty impressive for such a small place.  I ordered the egg sandwich which was prepared like a grilled cheese sandwich - buttered and grilled on both sides as opposed to just the egg, cheese and meat put in a bagel or two pieces of toast.  It made for a pretty tasty sandwich.  The bad:  Service was a bit lacking.  Not that I really needed a whole lot other than my food, but still.  It would have been nice if someone had just asked if I needed anything shortly after I got my food.  However, they charge for water.  Sure, it's only 25 cents, but when you're charging me over $8 for a simple egg sandwich and fries, I don't see how they justify charging for water.  You better believe that I took that styrofoam cup filled with ice with me.  I paid for it, after all.    I've noted that others mentioned Cherries does not take credit cards.  Well that is no longer the case.    I didn't have a bad overall experience there and I certainly struggled between 2 or 3 stars.  But the bottom line is I really enjoyed the sandwich, and that outweighed the bad in my opinion.",

This no frills joint offers solid breakfast and lunch fare at a reasonable price. The coffee was really good and the waitress kept it coming.  Speaking of the waitress, she was my favorite part of the dining experience.  She was rough around the edges, never smiled, but wasn't rude.  No time for chit-chat, but made sure you wanted for nothing.  She came across like she might actually smack you if you got out of line; I got the feeling she's done this before.  She was great...:)  The smaller than usual, to the point menu offered the standard diner fare. I went with the kitchen sink omelet made with onions, green peppers, ham and cheese served with honest-to-God home fries and your choice of toast.  The home fries were fried crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with the jagged and almost burnt edges...perfection. The omelet is made with the ingredients cooked into the egg as opposed to the egg surrounding them; not my preferred style but still a solid omelet.    The lower prices draws a little more of a sketchy crowd, but it just added to the classic ambiance of what you might think of for a hometown diner.    I would definitely go back.",

Forgive me for calling to ask if you still offer something on the menu and how much it costs! Cherries is known to have a biryani special on Fridays, so I wanted to come check it out.... and called to ask if it was still being available. The very rude lady who answered the call didn't hold back her heavy sigh and disinterested tone when she told me \"UGHHHH yeah its here but I'm closing in 15 minutes\". Then I asked how much it was , with another \"Ughhh $8 something\". Needless to say, I did not end up going because they clearly don't need the business. The couple times I've eaten breakfast there, the server didn't do as much as smile. Not exactly the type of \"customer service\" you would expect from a small business. I should have read the reviews before going there, as many state the server's obnoxiously rude behavior.  Updated review- June 2018: Racial profiling at its best. I came in, for biryani attempt #2 after many months. Lady mentioned in above review was on the phone, she looked at me and said \"how many\". So she could basically judge what I wanted based on my skin color. Pretty sure if a Caucasian person came in, she wouldn't assume they want bacon and eggs? Rude. At least have the decency to ask a customer what they want rather than assume. Learn some manners, lady with the short brown hair. Your business increases ten-fold because of an ethnic cuisine offering on Fridays so the least you can do is try to be a little respectful by not being presumptuous. Who manages this place? The saving grace is that the biryani is actually pretty good. 4 stars for the biryani and 0 for customer service.",

With coffee or the instant water you get upon sittin dahn..

    "text": "I was in town for a work conference and needed a diner that had a basic, good breakfast, and was referred to this place by the front desk staff. The reviews were a little mixed, so I was initially skeptical, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised with the food and my overall experience.   First off, it's a diner, not a five star restaurant. You come in, seat yourself, and someone will be with you. If you're expecting to be doted on and given the cloth napkin treatment then this place isn't for you. The menu was pretty expansive and everything very reasonably priced. I ordered an egg white omelette. It came with toast, but I didn't eat that. The omelette was very good, not overcooked, and a nice amount of toppings (a little heavy on the cheese but that was okay).   I will be going back for breakfast, as it seems you can't get a reasonably priced and hearty breakfast anywhere else in the downtown area. I took off a star because of the lack of ventilation. You walk in and immediately smell the food cooking. I was worried that I'd go to my conference smelling like fried bacon. They're moving across market square, so maybe the new restaurant will fix this issue.",

It looked just like the kind of nondescript diner that I like - and the kind that often hit a home run with theirbfood and service.  This one didn't.   We were seated, and the waitress promptly took our order - and then we didnt see her again until we finished the meal.    I ordered the Very Cherry French Toast, and my wife got the waffles with cherries.  At a restaurant named Cherries, you would figure that they would feature a proprietary cherry sauce/compote.    You'd be wrong.    Canned cherry pie filling, anyone?  Seriously.  Not something that looked/tasted canned.  Actual canned.    The italian bread for the French toast was pretty good, and the waffles were standard waffle mix (at least they weren't Eggos).  I was waiting for the waitress to bring more coffee, and after ten minutes, asked the food runner.  He either forgot to tell her or she ignored him, because five minutes later, I had to ask him again.  At that point , thebowner came and refilled my cup.  I understand being busy, but if youre going to be open on a football weekend, you need to staff adequately.  There are only 11 tables here, and I woukd expect better service.    With all the great breakfast options in Pittsburgh, I can't imagine I'll be back.",

It was hard to get her attention to receive new ones but we didn't care for using straws anyway so we didn't bother to ask when we saw her next. Then, we asked twice for ranch and syrup and she'd look like she'd be on her way to go get them but ended up taking orders from a couple of other customers. Finally after 15 min, another staff member asked if we needed anything and he immediately brought what we needed. The waitress was nice but I wished she learned to manage her time better.

I thought this cannot be possible if they serve diner food can this be possible. So the sun was out, I thought to go try it and sit at the Market Square tables to listen to the live music.   Let me just say I have had this dish in India and also many places in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. This simple meal at Cherries is as good as it gets.   For about $8 you get a lot of rice with three pieces of chicken as you can see in the photo. The spices were spot on and transported me back. The raita (yogurt sauce) is enough to cool things down and they throw in a soda or water for the same price.   I finished it all and recommend it for sure. You can tell it is good as I had about 8 South Asians in front of me in line  and when leaving with my take out a line out the door behind me. A hidden gem for sure, staff was super friendly, meal very authentic and a nice change from my usual lunch at another great Indian restaurant on Liberty Avenue",

The only downside was the waitress.  She got into a screaming match with someone in the kitchen.  She would come out to the dining room, take an order, then head back into the kitchen and start screaming.  Come back out again, deliver some food, then back to the kitchen where we'd hear the screaming.  It was very odd.  Based on the other reviews, this seems like pretty standard behavior.

The white bread was toasted nice and crispy and it was so buttery. The eggs were fried perfectly. With the salty and savory sausage and the super melted american cheese holding everything together, it was possibly one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.

    "text": "In town for a bachelor party.  Told to check out Cherries by the hotel folks. Arrive. Busy - line, but not to bad.  Go to sit. Tables only seat 4, we have 5 guys.  Grab a 5th chair.  Promptly told by staff, \"can't have a chair in the aisle, fire hazard.\"  They offered no solution. A couple nice ladies from St Louis invited me to sit with them while my buddies sat together. Their meal had wrapped up. But, we got to talking and had a nice convo. The sole waitress in the place brought me a place setting and then proceeded to wait on my buddies having forgotten/opted to ignore me. I tried to flag her down several times as she zipped about serving other tables. Left after 10 minutes without having been offered coffee/water.   I would say \"awful service\" but I received none. 40 minutes wasted. Staff at Dunkin Donuts next door were friendly and the food and coffee was delicious.",

    "text": "For as many times as I've been in the downtown Pittsburgh and Market Square areas, I did not know this place existed until a group of friends came here for lunch following the St. Paddy's Day Parade.  It's a cozy greasy spoon type place with some very reasonably priced breakfast and lunch items. I ordered the loaded French toast, which included two slices of Italian bread with cream cheese and strawberries, for $6.  I have no idea how long this place has been here, but it seems pretty cool to have a cute lil diner in the middle of downtown. Service was good.",

I really wanted to give it five stars but did not want to ruin their crusty reputation :-) the food was outstanding and honestly, the lady wasn't as rude as I was hoping for or expecting... We enjoyed everything about our meal and the only reason I'm literally not giving it five stars is because I truly think they don't want me to :-)",

Portions and prices are terrific. The food, not so much. Our special included a pancake, two scrambled eggs, home-fries and two pieces of sausage. Everything tastes exactly the same, like grease. So if you're into hefty portions of grease at a small price this is the establishment for you.",

    "text": "You had me at \"breakfast all day.\" Why more establishments don't serve breakfast all day is beyond me. Anyone who knows me or reads my Yelp reviews knows that breakfast is my favorite meal, to the extent that - if I miss breakfast my whole day is thrown off. Well, it was one of those days. I had such a busy morning at work that I never ate. I checked with Yelp to see if there was anywhere nearby that serves breakfast all day because it was only a Friday. Usually restaurants will be more lax about their breakfast hours on weekends. It was in my good fortune that Cherrie's Diner served breakfast. I was able to walk right in. Be prepared for everybody to call you \"darling\" and \"honey.\" I sat down at a table in the back. They tried to sit me closer to the door at first but it was too cold and they also had a fan going on the ceiling. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on rye. It was simple, cheap, and delicious. It came out in about 10 minutes and I was out of there in about a half hour. I also enjoyed a black coffee. The coffee was nothing short of diner coffee. You can definitely skip that part. All the breakfast items that they were bringing out looked delicious. There were a lot of people getting take out as well. I would go back, because I always just respect a place that respects breakfast.",
