    "text": "This place is good. The Tex-Mex omelet is the closest thing to Tex-Mex I've had since moving to PA from Texas and that includes the Mexican restaurants!  The banana chocolate chip hotcakes are more like a crepe than actual hotcakes. The Dor-Stop has them beat on banana chocolate chip hotcakes.   The famous lyonnaise potatoes were delicious. Very rich and tasty. The potatoes were better than my hotcakes and the Tex-Mex omelet was the winner by far.   The staff were friendly. It's a little hectic inside when it's busy. Trying to get in and get your name on the list while other people pile in causes some tension on making sure no one line jumps you.   The cash only thing is a little absurd and behind the times. I'd be interested in knowing the thought behind that. But if you're prepared its NBD.",

My ham and cheese omelet has less and less ham each visit, and the eggs are often over-cooked. The bacon is microwaved - unacceptable. The pancakes are still good, but we've been disappointed in everything else lately. Feels more like a \"fast food\" type of place. We recently went to the one in the strip and it's sooooo much better!",

Pamela's is great from their food, their speedy service, and their pricing. Their location is right off 19, so parking might be a little bit of a problem, but I live right down the street, so I just walk. Problem solved.  Back to the Pancake. Pamela's has clearly set the precedent for all the pancakes in the world. These things are the bees knees. I don't think I've ever had a pancake so good in my life. They seriously make every single pancake I've ever had before taste like mush. These cakes have so much flavor, and they're paper thin too. How do they do thattt???  I cherish having Pamela's right up the street from me, and I will continue on coming in and ordering their bangin' pancakes as frequently as I can.",

I was told that Obama was here, his only regret was never going to Pamela's.  Hearing that, I had to come.  I ordered the strawberry hotcakes and their famous lyonnaise potatoes.  I was surprised by the hotcakes.  These were crepe-style and included sour cream.  I've never had sour cream sound so good for breakfast.  I always associated sour cream with mexican food.  No longer!  These hotcakes were beyond delicious.  Then came the lyonnaise potatoes.  These were to die for as well.  They were crispy and soft the way potatoes in the morning should be.  I was in guilty forbidden foods heaven.  The only regret was that I couldn't share this food with my loved ones, as they were back home in California.  I took plenty of pictures just so I could share.    The ambiance was great too.  It had a very retro feel with 50s decorations.  I wish I could pick up this Pamela's and move it to the Bay Area, just so I could enjoy it more!",

    "text": "Note #1: This is likely common knowledge now, but it bears repeating in the service of awkwardness avoidance that Pamela's is strictly CASH ONLY.  Note #2: On Sundays, Pamela's only serves breakfast.  Note #3: Pamela's menu apparently differs depending on location as this Mt. Lebanon restaurant has items the others do not.   Dateline: Sunday May 15th-It's time for Kay to take me home to Brookline from Beaver Falls. Kay is craving pancakes like a zombie longs for live human flesh. She wants to go to Dor-Stop again, but they're only open until 2PM. It's just after noon, and we're 45 minutes away.   Enter Pamela's: As it turns out, there's an outpost of the Pamela's franchise a brick's toss away from my neighborhood over in posh Mt. Lebanon. I have been meaning to visit one ever since The Prez made the chain famous during a recent trip to our steel metropolis. Renowned for their pancakes, they're open until 3PM everyday including Sundays! Eureka!   We were greeted by a lovely white-haired woman that I'm sure is ranked in the top 1% of sweetest grandmothers in the world. From there, despite how bustling the place was at the moment, we were seated almost immediately.   Demeter, how I have pined for scratch corned beef hash. The stuff from a can will and has to do for my bachelor self from time to time, tasting just fine, especially in the form of a sandwich (I'm an Aquarian, we're strange like that). When I saw the words \"famous\" and \"homemade\" in the menu's description, I instantly knew what I wanted. The fact that lunch was unavailable on that day made my decision easier by narrowing my choices. There would be no burger on this early afternoon, no, no... Let There Be Corned Beef Hash and Eggs...over easy!  The phrase \"cooked to perfection\" seems to be the bane of at least one online food critic who finds it overused, particularly on Yelp, a site he seems to wish would go offline.  How else to say it? \"Prepared precisely?\" \"Crowningly coddled?\" \"Faultlessly fried?\"  \"Simmered sublimely?\"  The corned beef hash itself was ample in texture like a loose meatloaf, its flavors richly saliferous, dancing playfully on the edge of being overly so. The generous, lightly yellowed chunks of potatoes underneath were at that ideal point between solid and soft, the way properly cooked breakfast and salad potatoes need very much to be. My over easy eggs were equally indefectible, their yolks runny, warm, inviting dips from the duo of burly, buttery, bodaciously boss toast slices that came with them. The whites of the eggs were pillowy, breaking gently at the touch of fork and tooth, the seasoning dead-on.   Pamela's must employ Zen Masters of short order cookery; there is no other explanation for such uncannily made staples of morning fare. These culinarians are warriors, the best of the best, the kind trained clandestinely in remote locales that involve fire pits, spiked whips, throwing stars, poison arrows, and monks wielding quarterstaves.   Kay had Gail's Favorite Eggs and uttered not one complaint about them, eating quietly, seriously like a scientist studying the human genome; the mark of a superior meal being consumed.  Now it was onto the main event: A Pancake Tag Team Match.  In this corner at a total combined weight of errr...several pounds, The Chocolate Chip Banana and Strawberry Hotcakes.  In this corner at a total combined weight of...none of your business, Darren and Kay!  You get two pancakes to an order, each of us taking one Chocolate Chip Banana and one Strawberry.  Of repeating this maxim, I  tire not: Pancakes are dessert, a reward at the end of the rainbow, something to build towards, not a main breakfast course. Eating them with meat and eggs is a crime for the proteins distract from the lusciousness of the flapjack, Pamela's being especially so. Crepe-like in their thin structure, delicately crisp on their margins and exterior, palatial and butyraceous internally, I was positively enraptured.   The Strawberry Hotcakes are pumped full of brown sugar, sour cream (and that is so exquisitely Polish), and of course the freshest, most plump, juicy, and sweet strawberries. Clouds of whipped cream adorn them. The other sleeping bag of batter not only had whipped cream atop it but inside it as well, smothering the perfectly ripened banana and melted chocolate.  No syrup required.   A Pamela's breakfast is plateful of revelation: Simple diner food can be extraordinary. Fellow gastronauts,enlighten thyselves, journey Southward to Pamela's at dawn.   P.S. The service was genial and more than competent.  P.P.S. Our tab was just under $25. Had we simply split one dessert pancake dish (again there are two to an order, so it's easy to do), the bill would have come out to less than $10 a person, making Pamela's economical as well as delectable. Good food doesn't have to be expensive. Pamela's proves it.",

The bacon is good but seems kind of like that really thin chewy kind that is sold as pre-cooked bacon.  Nothing seemed overly greasy.  My pal got the pancakes stuffed with walnuts and bananas - these looked yummy but very indulgent.  The restaurant is a bit squishy - lots of tables and chairs to weave between until are shown to your seat.  The service is good and the food comes out quickly.  We went around 9am on a Saturday and there wasn't a wait.  As we left, a line was forming.  This isn't my favorite breakfast place in the area...but it is a solid option depending on which  neighborhood you're in.",

And you know what? It was still tasty! I was even surprised how awesome the fruit was! It was a big bowl full of delicious banana's and strawberries! They also have turkey bacon and sausage. I was tempted to add that one, you know, for more protein, but I stuck with my little satisfying dish.  This location is very tiny, so I'd strongly suggest going during off hours. I've been during peak and you wait forever! Plus, there's very limited parking on the side of the building. And most importantly, it's CASH ONLY, with no ATM for a couple blocks.

I also have to add that the folks I dined with, including myself, were \"sick\"toward the end of the day.

Talked to the server about this, he said that there wasn't anything he could do, he said I've only been here 3yrs????What??? So, we went to pay told  the cashier about the problem, she said se would talk to the cook! She removed it from our bill, which was \"THE  RIGHT THING TO DO!\"  I was more worried about the part of the burger that she ate!  I notified the owners to let them know about this, so it wouldn't happen to anybody else. and they never got back to me!!! \"THEY REALLY CARE!!\"",

    "text": "I've eaten here and at the place on the strip multiple times.  I will sum it up like this.  breakfast doesn't have to be greasy, sugary and disgustingly bad for you.  It doesn't.  You can get great potatoes without having to have your heart stop.  Even the eggs come out swimming in fat.  The bottom of my plate is just one big oil slick every time I go there.  The pancakes are thin because they're weighed down by 1000g of fat and again swimming in fat on your plate.   They're heavy, rich and just not necessary unless you're ordering them for desert and then I would serve 1/2 an order.  Nothing they make that I have tried is prepared with any care or finesse.  It's all over the top and it's not funny anymore.   Buy quality ingredients, prepare them properly without too much fat or sugar, season them properly and let them sing.    Breakfast is one of my favorite meals.  I should really start a Yelp list of some of my favorite places come to think of it.  I'm always sorry I ate here every time I get sucked in.  By the way, do something to filter your water because it tastes awful and is probably why the coffee is so bad.  Probably one of the better breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area if you're comparing regions which tells you about the quality of the food here.  I think Deluca's does a better job if you insist on eating out for breakfast in the 'burgh.",

I would like to see my server more than once  and not feel like I'm bothering her!   The multiple, persistent flies on every sticky surface, at this sitting, was so off putting I finally just left my meal.  Waitress watched us battling flies (I'm not talking one or two, but a dozen or so over tables, food, windows, everything) and didn't apologize or seem fazed or ask if anything was wrong with my mostly full meal pretty much left untouched.   I regret that we paid, but we did, and we left.  Definitley wont be returning.",

Gail's eggs are scrambled eggs that come with cram cheese and chives. I thought it sounded weird but it is delicious!!  It comes with home fries and toast. It's a very savory breakfast. If I'm in the mood for sweet then it's all about the hot cakes. They are thin-not as thin as crepes but very close. They have vanilla in the batter which makes them wonderful. They are crispy around the edges so you get soft hot cakes with a bit of crunch. You can get them with chocolate chips and bananas or other combinations or even filled with strawberries and whipped cream but I love them plain.  It's a CASH only place so hit the ATM first.",

My first concern was how long will the wait be on a Saturday morning. The wait was surprisingly short. We were quoted 30 minutes, and to my delight, our table was ready in 15 minutes. We ordered the famous pancakes, banana pancakes, and another dish off of the favorites menu so that we could try the lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were remarkable. They were super thin, cooked perfectly, and the edges were crispy. The banana pancakes were stuffed with fresh sliced bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream. So damn good! I also enjoyed the potatoes but the pancakes really were the star of show.  Pamela's only takes cash. Stop by an atm and get cash so you can get these pancakes.",

The portions were very small and didn't not equate at all to the inflated prices.  The Tex-Mex omlet was OK but VERY small.  The bacon was downright awful.  The meat and eggs was also very small and there was no way that it equated to 2 eggs.  Service was ok but certainly didn't go out of their way be very friendly.  With so many great places for breakfast in the area I would suggest someplace OTHER than Pamela's.",

It is a small location and parking is a hassle with the attached lot being super tiny.   I typically get the morning after breakfast special, which is 2 hotcakes, eggs, and ham. It is always satisfying and hard to finish but nothing extraordinary. The hotcakes are just very thin crepes. I have also had the tex mex omelet, which was very filling but nothing memorable.  My friends always enjoy the stuffed hotcakes such as the banana chocolate chip, but I just find them too sweet.   I will say their lyonnaise potatoes are quite delicious. I will make an effort to order a side of these if they don't come with my meal. Overall, I don't understand the hype about their hotcakes. It is worthwhile trying once but thats it.",

After 15 minutes or so, we were sat and our waitress came over to grab our drink order & returned promptly with them. We requested to have a few minutes with the menu. The kid got 2 chocolate chip pancakes, ham & rye toast. Hubby got French toast, bacon & rye toast.  As much as I wanted crepe style pancakes, I am on a no wheat diet, so I chose Gail's Eggs.   We all liked our meals, which came out incredibly fast, especially for how busy the place was. The fellas enjoyed their meals more than I did mine, but only because I'm not a big onion eater and there were a lot of onions in the potatoes that came with my eggs.  Coffee was good, decor was 50's space agey (which is quite unique) and the service was good, as was the food. Will definitely give it another try and pick something else on the menu to savor.   *Take CASH with you as they are a cash only diner*",

We didn't wait long, maybe 5 minutes at the most on a Friday morning around 10am.   We ordered three meals for the two of us, two savory and one sweet. It was all fantastic. The toast was a little too soaked in butter, but what did we expect from an old school diner? Still delicious.   As tourists, we didn't know we had to pay in only cash. But the ATM was right around the corner and a very convenient 45 second walk.   It could have been a little cleaner, but they were very busy. Good service for how busy they were.  We would eat here again solely for the croissant French toast. Yum!",

    "text": "I just....come on, Pamela's. I usually enjoy my experiences at this chain but they have some work to do to make me want to keep coming.  This review is representative more of this particular experience than the company as a whole.   Everyone who's been to Pamela's knows that it's cash only at this point,  but I do find that a little ridiculous in 2017. They aren't a single restaurant anymore, or a small diner in a small town - they are a thriving local chain in a major city, boasting-I believe-7 locations.  If I can accept a payment from a credit card using my phone,  Pamela's can install a credit card reader.   Went in for lunch on a Wednesday.  There were 4-5 tables seated including ours and two servers to cover them, so not busy at all. However, ours ignored us after getting drinks and didn't take our orders for another 20 minutes. A couple that came in after us was eating before we even got to order. He said he thought we just wanted coffee, though we gave no indication for this and were very clearly looking at the menus? And even after he apologized for that and said he'd be right back, he disappeared for 5 more minutes-cleaning behind the counter, refilling other customers' waters, etc. I eventually gave up on trying to catch his eye and had to call out and flag him down. I hate doing that.    The food was ok.  I've never ordered anything but breakfast there before and I won't again. I got the Greek chicken wrap. The spinach was overcooked and bitter and the wrap could have used more cheese.  The worst part was the chicken though.  They use the reconstituted chicken breasts and you can always tell.  Rubbery to chew and not a very pleasant taste.  The lyonnaise potatoes,  however,  were delicious as always.   The worst part of the experience was HOW.  INCREDIBLY.  COLD.  it was inside the restaurant. All but two people were eating in their coats. My hands were cold. My toes were cold. The food very quickly got cold,  which definitely did not help me want to eat it. I kept drinking cup after cup of coffee to stay warm. A pair of diners got up and left before placing their orders and told the wait staff that it was because it was just too cold. They feigned surprise, which was just silly. The kitchen staff were all wearing hoodies. One even had his hood up. The staff in a restaurant kitchen were *that* cold. If you've ever worked at a restaurant before, you know this is kinda unheard of. My friend and I went down the street after our meal to a coffee shop to warm up just from being inside Pamela's.  If something is wrong with your heating system or it's too expensive to heat your business to a comfortable temperature, you shouldn't be open in the winter-at least not if your business is a restaurant. Don't make customers suffer. You'd think that all the money they must be saving in credit card fees would enable them to actually heat the place...   I don't think I'll be back to this location, at least not until summer.",

I assure you, no, I have not been smoking the crack.   There is a whole wall mural and within that mural is the city of Pittsburgh and a cat in an astronaut suit and that cat is space cat. The wall says something like, whenever he visits, apparently space cat is a he, anyway, whenever he visits earth, space cat stops by and eats at p&g's or something close to that. I don't know, I only read it once because my son sat right below space cat and since I sat across from him, I couldn't help but to look up at space cat and there's something about this cat that pulls you in, maybe it's the eyes?   I would've taken a picture but honest to whatever you may believe in, I don't have a smartypants phone so you'll have to take my word for it.

We went there on Sunday around 10 and the place was very busy but we immediately got a table and it didn't take too long to get our food. The one negative is that it is very loud, my boyfriend could barely hear me talk. They do have outdoor seating so that would have been a better option for us. Also the place only accepts cash which we did not know before we arrived and had to leave before sitting to get money from the bank. But overall the food is yummy. We both got the famous crepe pancakes and bacon as our meat. I couldn't even finish mine I was so full! Our waitress was also very sweet but our host was a bit gruff. In the end, a very enjoyable experience.",

Twice I've been served bad food at Pamela's P & G Diner. Luke warm, poorly cooked, served with a scowl. Ugh, ick. Sadly, they sell something they call \"crepe-style\" hotcakes, which aren't.  I'd happily make concessions for the shoddy service if they'd make an effort to serve a half-way decent \"crepe-style\" thing instead of the barely cooked flavour-less batter-y things topped with goo that were dropped in front of our party of five.  I remember the salad I was served on my first visit looked like it was topped with floor sweepings - I didn't even attempt it and requested it be removed from the cheque.    If only the food they served came close to what you imagine when you read the menu, it could be an all right restaurant, probably.  (i believe there are 5 of these stores in pittsburgh, i've only \"eaten\" at the washington rd location, but never again)",

The front entry was packed upon entering but we waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. We ordered our food (blueberry hotcakes, hotcake regular stack, sides of eggs and bacon) and the food came out in less than 5 minutes. They are excellent with the turnaround time between coming in and out.   The food is consistently good and never disappoints- would be 5 stars but it was missing the welcoming customer service factor (though we understand with the high volume of customers entering that the food production takes precedence over the extra step with customer service that we have grown to love about the Burgh)  Would still recommend any Pamela's location for someone visiting the Burgh:)",

The food was exceptional. We sampled the chocolate waffle, pancakes, strawberry french toast, and my favorite among them, corned beef omelet. Our server was proactive, friendly, and willing to find ways to make my kids smile. I highly recommend this eatery for any outing in the area. Pros: meals are priced below average for most American-fare and diner-styled restaurants. Food quality is better than I expected, and portions are larger than most. Staff is swift, friendly, and accomodating. Cons: parking is minimal, but this is True for most businesses in the Mt. Lebanon area. I only cite this because the parking lot and on-street spaces are very small and difficult to maneuver into.",

We knew parking can be tricky and the wait can be long, but we parked on the street which was a 10 second walk to the diner and when we went in to get a table there was no wait. They will however not seat you until your entire party has arrived. I was a little bothered by this since there were many tables available and I could have been sitting enjoying a coffee, but she did decide to let us sit down after we waited a few minutes for our friends to arrive, which was nice. I can see why they do that when it is busy though. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Everyone who ordered pancakes really enjoyed them and I ordered Gail's Eggs which was very good. I loved the cream cheese on top. I just wish there was more eggs than potatoes and bread. The potatoes were alright and I also got a side of turkey sausage which tasted good. This place was a nice breakfast spot close to home, but was a little more pricy compared to other places around town that I have been to.",

    "text": "When my parents asked my boyfriend and I where we wanted to eat after the PGH Marathon, we both automatically said \"Pam's!\" Since we both have since moved from Pittsburgh, we were definitely craving the addicting hotcakes that we enjoyed so often as students at Pitt. We nearly forgot that Pam's was cash-only, so make sure you keep that in mind! Even though we visited the suburbs location, we still waited for ~10 minutes, but would have gladly waited much longer. Once we were seated, our waitress was over almost instantaneously to take our drink orders, and then was right back with our coffees. I am devoted to the hotcakes, so I don't even look at the other items on the menu (although my parents and friends rave about the potatoes). This time, I went for the strawberry hotcakes, which is pretty much always my go-to. The combination of the strawberries and brown sugar provides the sweetness I crave, but this is nicely balanced by the sour cream rolled up in the crispy, thin pancakes to make the perfect dish that is sweet, but not overly so. I don't know what it is that Pam's does to their hotcakes, but the crisp is always perfect on the cakes and is not replicable (trust me, I've tried). A Pittsburgh classic for sure and one that never disappoints. Thank you Pamela's, for always making each visit to Pittsburgh a little sweeter.",

This hash is just the right amount of \"hot.\"  There is some minced jalapeno in there, along with medium-spicy chorizo sausage.

I couldn't find much chorizo, it was mostly salsa. The potatoes were very good and buttery. We've been to other locations and ways enjoy our food. As advertised, cash only!",

The customer was a quiet older women, if they treat her like that how do you expect them to treat you? So that finalized my decision to not stay today and never go back.",

It's hard to support local businesses when this happens. Noticed she would forget to place utensils on people's tables. We are pretty straight forward people and don't spend a long time ordering food with specific needs. So don't understand the tude. Although just noticed she was like that with everyone. Shame good food and coffee. Money goes elsewhere.",

I didn't realize that until I was inside, but luckily my friends had enough to spot me haha It can be pretty busy during breakfast, but they get people in and out fast!  My boyfriend ordered the morning after breakfast which came with pancakes, sausage, and eggs.  The pancakes came out looking like beautiful sunbursts! Super cute and super yummy! He also substituted the eggs for Gail's favorite eggs, which are scrambled eggs, cream cheese and scallions, this may sound like an odd combination, but it was creamy, savory and delicious!  I ordered the 2 eggs, sausage and potatoes and it was perfecto! The service was also really great! I know I'll be back again soon!",

The interior had that old Towne diner feel but was clean and bright.  The food was ready in five minutes. The coffee and the food were hot,  fresh,  and delicious. I had the morning after breakfast special,  simple but elegant and the most unique and delicious plain pancakes I've ever had! The scrambled eggs were real and flavorful,  and the sausage had that perfect pop when you bite into it with a juicy savory interior. If they can make a simple breakfast staple taste this good, I can't wait to see what else they've got.  I'm definitely coming back.  Franchise anyone?",

My wife had the strawberry pancakes and loved them - the hotcakes had a great buttery crunch to the edges.  I had the texas french toast, which was batter-dipped buttery goodness incarnate.  All the portions were ample for the price, no one went away hungry.  The only downside was parking.  The lot is minscule, and on-street parking was a minor pain, but not unexpected for a Saturday brunch (11am).  The other downside was that during said saturday brunch rush, the close-packed tables can be loud when the place is full of people.",

My family and I were excited to try it, especially because the location is in a really cool part of Pittsburgh. I'm all for trying the dives and small town \"institutions\", but this is one that I can't get behind. I so wanted to like this place and our experience was just awful from start to finish. Our service was appalling- there really wasn't an service at all actually. If we needed anything or wanted to add something on, we were SOL. Took our order, dropped our check with food and never saw him again. Unfortuantely, the food wasn't much better. Between the 6 of us, we got a pretty large variety and none of us really enjoyed our food. My 4 year old son wouldn't eat his pancakes at all; they're really quite different which I don't always see as a bad thing, but they just were not good. I felt like our bill was extremely overpriced for what we got and our overall experience. It kinda shocked me that people think so highly of this place, especially after looking at our bill. It would be one thing to put up with all of this if it were because it was a bargain. But, alas, it was not. I'd be hard-pressed to ever want to return.",
