    "text": "I love this place and am surprised it doesn't get more attention. I've been 10+ times - mostly recently, four of us came for dinner last night. I almost always make a reservation and it's easy to do online. The restaurant is cozy and intimate and in warm weather like last night, you can dine on the patio which is definitely a plus. The best part is the food, as I have never had a less-than-fantastic meal here.   To start, they bring fresh crusty bread with balsamic and olive oil. Last night, we ordered the calamari and buffalo mozzerella/caprese appetizers, both which were perfect sizes for sharing among four people. The menu has a nice variety but the seafood and pasta are the real standouts. For entrees, we ordered the frutti di mare pasta, salmon, gnocchi, and veal risotto. I tried the first three - all were divine. The spicy tomato cream with lump crab mixed in on the frutti di mare is one of my absolute favorite pasta sauces and if you like scallops, the ones at Lucca are always perfectly cooked and fresh. On previous trips, I've also tried their daily ravioli, seafood mixed grill, and mushroom risotto and all were great. We also ordered the lemon semifreddo and the chocolate cake and highly recommend both. Prices are reasonable, especially for the quality and amount of food. I've also always had great service, even on busier nights.",

Lamb chops were delicious perfectly cooked the accompanying mushroom risotto was a perfect side. My wife went with the tiger shrimp dish (I'm not going to try to spell it). Good but over priced. Nice size portions on everything. Not too much but didn't leave you hungry.  If you go which I would recommend at least once. Save room for dessert. The carrot cake is worth the trip and the bill!   P.S.  The service was some of the best I've experienced from the host to the wait staff. Extremely professional",

I have had delicious quiche here, but it was pretty standard as far as quiche goes and nothing to write home about. Everything I saw on the menu was just so expensive, and I didn't see any wow factors in terms of what they serve. The nice part about going with a big group is that you see a lot of different items at once, but everything looked pretty average. Not a ton of option for vegetarians outside of salads, but they serve pastas, so you could probably ask for something special.    In terms of ambiance, it is upscale and masculine, with darkly hued, well appointed furniture and decor. The dining areas are comfortable and clean. There is a wonderful outdoor seating area that has a large awning, when temperature permits.",

    "text": "Went here on a quiet Friday evening with friends. The place is much more sophisticated than it looks from the outside so the prices are deceivingly high. I ordered the mushroom ravioli, which is served with chicken, tomatoes and a white cream sauce. The pasta was good, but the sauce was quite heavy and I was unable to finish. It was a little disappointing because the dish was $18 for about 5 raviolis in a sauce I couldn't even eat. At that price, I'd expect a little better. A friend ordered the 10oz. filet mignon, which was delicious and served with cheesy potatoes au gratin. Others ordered the mafalda pasta but they forgot the cheese one of them.  Our server was great -- I half expected subpar treatment at such a place being a bunch of hungry casually-dressed grad students, but he was very attentive and pleasant, even answering questions about the food with detail and without judgment. Overall a very nice meal, despite the fact that some of the clientele seemed bothered by our presence (seems most customers were older, more affluent type).  At the end of the day, I just felt it was overpriced. I wouldn't expect $20 simple pasta dishes and $35 entrees at a place located around the corner from numerous universities and across from a Quizno's.",

I ordered the Mafalda, which I would DEFINITELY recommend.  It was thick, almost lasagna-type pasta (though not as thick) with mushrooms, artichokes, plum tomatoes, greens and feta.  It was AMAZING, the mushrooms are artichokes really added a great flavor -- and in my opinion, you can't go wrong with feta.    My boyfriend got the linguine, which had Atlantic salmon, diced tomatoes, spinach and pesto sauce.  The salmon was good, but the rest was kind of lackluster -- plus the pesto sauce was more of a soup type consistency.  I prefer pesto sauce to be a little bit thicker.. they may have gone a little thick on the olive oil.    But definitely recommended - especially on a summer night, I loved watching the foot traffic go by while we ate.",

They also bring out fresh bread with olive oil & balsamic vinegar, which was good. The downside is they do not have a very big vegetarian selection. When I went there was only 2 vegetarian entree options. My first choice was the gnocchi pasta but they were out of gnocchi so I was forced to get the only other vegetarian entree on the menu, pasta w/ vegetables in olive oil. I did not like it at all. I couldn't even finish it. It had hardly any flavor and there was so much oil it made me sick. I was really disappointed b/c I have had good pasta there before. I guess they're really hit or miss unfortunately. I may go back but it'll be a while, not my first choice.",

The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sauce had that metal taste, as if it came straight from the can.  The meatballs themselves (2) were ok, but lacked flavor.   The bartender never once came over to see how our meal was, and in fact we never saw him again until we were finished and ready for the bill.   Lucca does have nice ambiance, and is dimly lit.

The biggest reason why I'm only giving one star is because I witnessed the server dropping something from my Risotto as she was bringing it over. But instead of apologizing, she picked it up and hid it behind her back. Even though I witnessed her doing this, I didn't say anything because I wasn't 100% sure if it was food that she dropped on the floor. But my suspicions were confirmed when I saw that the table next to us ordered the same risotto and had more content that my plate was missing.

When my dad and I walked in for a late lunch on a weekend, the host was a little curt, but our server was very friendly. We were seated at a table for two that was sectioned off by columns, which could make for a very intimate setting.  I had the Atlantic salmon, which came on a bed of steamed asparagus and spinach with a chive butter sauce. The menu said steamed rice instead of the spinach. I would have appreciated the carbs, especially since the portions are on the smaller side here, but I didn't mind the spinach either. The salmon was incredibly moist, possibly due to the fact that it was on the fattier side. The vegetables were fine, and the sauce was, well, buttery-tasting.  My dad ordered the grilled boneless chicken breast, which came on a bun, with fries and ketchup. (He also could've chosen salad or soup.) I tried some of his chicken, which was heavily (though not excessively) seasoned and tender. He seemed to enjoy it. The fries were crispy and pretty good, and I liked that they were seasoned with something other than salt. I'm not sure what it was.  I'm not itching to return, but I had a good experience.",

The friendly and knowledgeable staff bring perfectly prepared fresh dishes.  Anything involving pasta is particularly expertly served up by this Italian ristorante.  Why not give Lucca the full fiver? All the dishes were very standard fair, no imaginative surprises, and were a bit heavy on the oil.    A lack of innovation, does not mean a lack of flavor or quality, but for $20-$40 entrees I'd like a twist.  Come for a celebratory lunch, get appetizing entrees at half the evening prices and enjoy the uncrowded upscale ambiance and the shining Craig street sunshine! Bellisimo!",

Before going to the Phipps winter garden with my date we decided we would get a good bite to eat. It was about 6:00 PM and we walked into Lucca. The place was empty with only two tables occupied. I was asked if I had reservations and I said no. The host gave me this look like are you kidding me? And starts shuffling through the papers on the host stand and goes \"well I guess we could seat you here\" and by here, it was the worst seat in the restaurant right in the front. The waitress came over and she was nice but where I was sat in the restaurant every time someone came in I would be bumped. Was very annoying. We order two of the most expensive meals on the menu and I have to say they were good. We finished up our meal and the by the time we were done a total of 4 tables were occupied. I just didn't like the guys attitude. Probably won't ever go back which is a shame because it was good. Sucks to suck I guess...",

I came on a cool, windy night with a friend, and the feel of eating outdoors along with the high-class Italian food created a very European atmosphere which I loved. The dinner was wonderful, and everything was well made with fresh ingredients. I had the Linguine, and my friend had the Papparadelle. I thought the Linguine delicious with well-made pesto, and it avoided being too unctuous thanks to the salmon. We had the Italian Lemon Torte for desert, and it was wonderfully light and refreshing after the dinner. The vanilla oil was rich but not heavy and full of flavor. The berry glaze helped give it a tarty taste which helped lighten it up. The whole dinner was just incredible.  My only gripe is with the price, but honestly, I think the atmosphere and the food combined are worth the price. I won't go back for a while because I do believe the price is a bit prohibitive, but if I had the resources, this would be one of my staple restaurants to enjoy for a night out.",

A bowl of soup is $7 and the \"bowl\" is more like a plate it is so shallow and I had 2 bones in my soup. Absolutely nothing is included with the over priced entrees. I opted to add scallops to my fettuccine an the gave me 2! That's right 2! The service was terrible. It took us 20 minutes to get our drinks and we only got 3 out of 4 and he had to wait another 5 minutes. When our meals came,  the first 2 of 4 came and the other two took nearly another ten minutes to come out. All said and done $224 for 4 of us to eat at this place after tip.  I would not mind this, but the best part of the meal was the over priced wine.  Terrible, we will never go back and will be tell others the same.  Wanna be upscale place that is really bad.

We eat out a lot and this is the first time we've seen each server responsible for making their own drinks. This created quite a few issues: one server was in the middle of a complicated drink for someone at the bar and left to serve food then came back a few minutes later and wasn't sure where she was in the process; there was a long delay in getting drinks; and at one point there were 3 servers behind a small bar stumbling around each other. Our server who was also the manager for the night did not know how to pour wine and was very inattentive.  Our food was extremely slow coming out of the kitchen with no comment by the server/manager. When we asked about an appetizer that came out cold instead of apologizing the manager/server was defensive and inappropriate. There was no-one bussing tables so plates and empty glasses were left on table and water not refilled quickly. All of our dishes were delicious but given how poorly the restaurant is managed we will not likely return.",

Our waitress was pretty nice and knowledgeable of the menu, which came to be quite useful when we were told that they were out of both risottos which is what we both opted for initially.   We ended up ordering the meatballs for appetizer. The meatballs were pretty flavorful and satisfying for an app.   I ended up getting the mushroom ravioli with scallops  when they ran out of the mushroom risotto. Despite the fact that I did not originally order this dish, I was so glad I ordered it and took the waitress's recommendation. The raviolis were very flavorful with that earthiness that mushrooms tend to have. The sauce that accompanied this dish was mushroomy and creamy, just amazing topped with scallops. Overall this dish was very, very good and delicate at the same time.   My husband had the bucatini with wild boar bolognese. My husband was not too impressed with this dish, and to be honest, compared to my dish, it was night and day.   Overall it was a good experience and would be willing to return, especially because of the reasonable prices and to actually try that mushroom risotto, because that mushroom sauce was out of this world!",

They have a great covered patio outside on a level above the sidewalk which allows you to people-watch.   We shared two appetizers: Stracciatella di Bufalo: delicious. Buffalo mozzarella mixed with cream.  Wild mushroom risotto: this went fast so I couldn't get a proper photo. Pretty good.  For entrees, people got the Branzino and the Scallops special. I had the Fettuccine with mushrooms, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, feta. The balance of ingredients made for an unremarkable flavor. The pasta texture was excellent: thin and delicate.  For the non-veggie dishes, the Branzino and the Scallops were reportedly good but it came with a strange lentil puree which had no real flavor.   Overall, there were a few highlights (buffalo cheese, fish preparation, and pasta quality) but there were inconsistencies between and even within the dishes. It's a nice restaurant with mediocre food.",

I've been to Lucca for relaxed dinner with friends, business meetings, and romantic dates and somehow Lucca has the right atmosphere for all three occasions.

It started out a little rough, just a long wait and then our food wasn't quite right, so we informed our server who brought over the manager, a man named Surav. This is where things went bad. Surav was very clearly drunk, and not standard bar manger drunk, but could smell the liquor on his breath slurring his words drunk. He made a large fuss, and my wife and daughter were both rather uncomfortable with this clearly drunken man. My wife got frustrated after trying to explain the problem and his drunken self not getting what was wrong. He left after some fuss and replaced our meal, I thought that would be the end of it, but no. As i was coming back from the bathroom I heard him make several incredibly rude comments, referring to my wife as \"A b***h\" and saying she \"must be like that because she wasn't getting enough D***\" I was horrified and absolutely livid, I listened as he went on to make a few incredibly lewd comments about my daughter (who is 17 by the way mind you) , and saying several just disgusting sexual things. I was furious, we payed our tab and left I wish I had confronted him but I didn't. For someone in a restaurant to conduct themselves like this is disgraceful, and whoever actually runs this place should be ashamed of themselves for even employing someone who acts like Surav. The food was great once they fixed the issue, but completely overshadowed by the drunken, rude, and vile manager.",

    "text": "I heard Lucca had hired a new Chef and have been there twice since in the last few weeks, once for lunch and once for dinner. Let's get this out of the way first: Lucca is pricey.  I got their burger at lunch and it was really well seasoned and perfectly cooked. It's really up there for me for beat burgers I've had in Pittsburgh. They added some crispy prosciutto and that was a nice touch, but the burger itself was a star. As for the fries I (sadly but wisely) opted out. The salad was small, but light. The burger was more than enough for me.  And for dinner I devoured a gnocchi dish with 2 large scallops in a butternut squash sauce for dinner and it was perfectly executed. Maybe I'm just really easy to please but gnocchi and scallops are both a little bit of a challenge to get right.  Lucca is also doing brunch now and I'd love to come back to try it out. I think they're really trying to compete now that the more laid back Union has remodeled and foodie darling Legume is up the street, and honestly they should be competitive! Lucca has the best outdoor seating on the street, so they get points for that.  To many Pitt and CMU grads it might remain the place that was too expensive for them to even look at the menu. However to those alumni: if you're not overburdened by student debt (TBH a small population), you should give Lucca a chance.",

Now if you want a menu with typical Americanized-Italian (Stromboli, calzone, Alfredo, etc), then Lucca will shock you. Yes they have a delicious steak on the menu. And yes, steak is very Italian (central Italy).   Fantastic appetizers (stracciatella cheese with olive tapenade was incredible), insalate mista was spot on, and for an entre I had swordfish with capers a lemon sauce, side of red sauce bolognese pasta. wow. So good.   Truly a 5-Star establishment.",

The appetizers are amazing from the cheeses paired with fig jam and crispy prosciutto to the lightly fried calamari with spicy tomato sauce and peppers. Be sure to try the pastas which are made in house using locally sourced vegetables for the sauces. The meatballs are also handmade to order and are full of flavor. Together, it's easily best dish of spaghetti and meatballs (topped with melted straciatella cheese). The tagliatelle is just as good if not better. My favorite entrees are the filet, veal, or the mixed grill are always solid choices. But do not miss out on the marvelous molten lava cake!!",

They do a fantastic job of balancing their dishes to not make them too heavy. Keep in mind that their menu changes. I wouldn't say that it's \"seasonal\" because it doesn't work to cater to seasonal vegetables or anything of the same. However, they do take dishes off and put new ones on, so don't be surprised if you view an old menu somewhere online or if you return and the dish you loved the last time isn't there any more. (I promise you that you will find something else JUST as delicious!)   While this isn't really a beer sort of place and you'd most likely order wine with the dishes, if you ARE a beer drinker (you probably are if you're in Pittsburgh...) the beer selection is odd. Dogfishhead 60 min IPA, Hoegarten, and Peroni - that's it. I haven't tried the cocktails, so I can't speak to that.  Someone below mentioned the service as to why they gave such low stars. I've never been impressed with the service, but they're not horrible. I think it's just a little odd at the not top notch service for such a nice restaurant, but don't let that keep you from coming. Just keep it in mind where you do!",

The restaurant is small and crowded, but not in the way of quaint New York Italian restaurants. The menu is relatively limited with just a few pasta, fish, and meat choices. The only thing we tried were two entres, the linguine with shrimp and the Norwegian cod. Both were good. The wine list is a very strong feature, with a good variety of domestic and foreign choices at extremely attractive prices. The food prices are also reasonable. Service was prompt and professional from the Oakland-required college student. Overall it was a pretty decent experience, but without notable, compelling reasons to return. Dining on the porch is a plus in the warm spring and fall months.",

    "text": "Lucca is a favorite when visiting Pittsburgh. I like their approach to Italian-American cooking. The menu at Lucca changes frequently, so one is sure to find something new among the entrees or the salads. I liked the Spinach Salad on my first visit, but have not seen it listed since. After trying the Cesar salad and the Chopped Salad on different visits, I will stay with the Chopped Salad for now. A tasty appetizer for sharing is the Fritto Misto, combining oysters, shrimp and calamari. (Better than calamari alone!) For an entree, I select a pasta dish. Each of the pastas comes with its own signature accompaniment. I've tried the Tagliatelli and Rigatoni (both with braised pork sugo), Risotto ai Vitello e Pepe (with veal and a trio of peppers), and Alla Chitara (with meatballs). The latter is a spaghetti-like pasta, but is hollow. I've enjoyed them all, but I suppose my favorite is the braised pork sugo. Portions are ample, so here will be some to take home for later.  The interior of Lucca is very attractive. It is dark in the evening, but lit with a variety of stained glass panels. The only downside to Lucca is that seating is very snug. Someone always seems to be bumping into my chair no matter where I sit.   Parking can be a challenge, but I am usually able to find a spot on Fillmore Street, down from the restaurant.",

Found out quickly there is no bar tender.  Servers are in charge if getting there own drinks.  Sat at the bar for about 15 min having numerous servers filling their own tables drinks and not making eye contact with us.  Finally the hostess came over and took our drink orders.  She did feel bad and made them on the house. Finally got seated and ordered or meals.  Service was slow but not terrible.  I ordered the Frutti di Mare con Rigatoni because I love seafood, especially scallops which was supposed to be in the dish.  Unfortunately the chef forgot to include this item.  By the time my server came back around to see how things were, I was 3/4's done with my meal.  He offered to have the chef cook up some scallops, but I declined considering I was basically finished with my dish.  Although disappointed I didn't get the scallops, the dish was pretty good so it wasn't a huge deal. However, when my bill came, they charged me full price for my dish.  Considering the scallops was one of the key ingredients that caused my pasta dish to cost what it did, I was a bit surprised the server didn't discount the dish, but whatever.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the city.",

However whenever we found out that it was in the coupon books (Enjoy/Entertainment) we decided to head there on our date night.  I made reservations on OpenTable for 7 PM and we arrived to the restaurant right around that time and were immediately seated.  They put us in what I originally thought was a weird location as it was a somewhat secluded two top in the \"bar area\".  The longer that we were there the more I appreciated it though as I actually enjoyed being somewhat secluded from the rest of the restaurant.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start out by splitting the fritto misto and then for my entree I went with the fettuccine.  Our appetizer came out first and consisted of fried oysters, shrimp, calamari, asparagus and peppers with a lemon aioli.  The breading on all of it was nice and allowed you to enjoy the flavor of the seafood and vegetables inside.  I also enjoyed the lightness of the aioli which made a great dipping sauce for all of it.  After we had finished that our entrees came out and my fettuccine consisted of hand rolled fettuccine with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, greens, artichokes,  pine nuts and feta.  If the menu hadn't said that the pasta was hand rolled I wouldn't have been able to tell you that.  Still the pasta was cooked nicely and I appreciated all of the ingredients that were in it especially the sun dried tomatoes and artichokes each which brought their own acidity to the dish.  Overall it was a solid dish and my wife enjoyed her pasta as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I am not sure why neither my wife nor I have visited Lucca before but we both enjoyed our experience and food on this visit.",

The cheese plate was a nice snack to accompany the wine.  Small bar area that was full, a medium sized dining room, and when the weather is nice you can sit at their outdoor patio.

We chose the salad, entree and dessert courses, and could pick from options under each category that our guests could choose.  We had our dinner on the outdoor patio, which was set up beautifully.  I am not sure what was more impressive - the food or the service.  Hector recommended the wines and managed the menus and organizing the timing of the courses, and wines.  It was phenomenal.  The salad had a surprising hint of horse radish, that gave it a nice kick.  Everyone who chose the watermelon soup raved.  Then onto the entrees - we chose chicken, pork, salman and pasta primavera options, and everyone chose something they loved.  The portions were very generous, cooked perfectly and all had really interesting flavors/spice blends that were truly delicious.  Everyone was so happy with their choice, including the desserts - tiramisu or bananas foster.    The entire dinner was perfection.  Everyone loved it and vowed to return to the restaurant for more.  The incredible thing for me as the host was how easy Jen made it or organize the evening.  I'm very busy, but I still want it to be perfect, and Lucca delivered!   Thanks Jen, Hector and the entire Lucca staff!",

My companion was debating whether to mention that the artichoke in his pasta was not just heart, but also leathery, inedible leaves. But they made a good pile at the bottom of the plate, so he pointed them out to the server who said he'd mention it to the chef. The server was dispatched from the kitchen to report that \"that was the way they came out of the can of artichoke hearts\". Really, from a self-respecting chef? I'll tell you what: give me the brand name, I'll buy some other brand and eat at home.",

My SO ordered the spaghettini and meatball dish: the meatballs were huge and tasted homemade!  The service and atmosphere were great and they had a cute patio to eat on as well!  I will definitely be back when craving Italian!",

The dishes that we tried last night and the ones that I've tried in the past have always been good.  The presentation is top notch and the atmosphere inside and outside on the patios is quite nice.    If I was to grip about anything, it would be the portion size for what an average entree costs . I can forgive that for a place that is extremely high end, but Lucca is not that.  It does prevent me for dining with them more than I do.    My next grip would be the wine list and costs.  I dont expect the world for nothing but I generally start to question buying any wine with dinner with the bottle that I buy are on the menu for 3x and 4x what they liquor store pricing is.  You generally expect at least 2x, but they really stretch it here.  We enjoy our dinners without a bottle for that reason.  Even with my two gripes, I would still highly recommend Lucca.  Nice meal, and nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "I live approximately two blocks from Lucca, and have walked by it about a gazillion times.  Given that my friends and I had plans to head to Phipps on Sat. evening, and that they wanted to have dinner somewhere on Craig St., I suggested it, given that it's one of the few upscale options.  As you can see by my rating, unfortunately, our visit left something to be desired.  The main issue was the service.  From the time we sat down, it was clear that serving us was not a priority.  After 10 min., the waiter came to take our drink orders, and then brought them out in another 5 min.  However, after that, we sat for about 15 min. with no sign of him coming back to take our food orders.  I finally went up to the hostess stand and demanded service, which was followed by him coming over to take our order in short order.  For our appetizer, we ordered the terra stracchiatella de bufula ($15), which consisted of fresh mozzarella, crispy prosciutto, and fig jam.  We also ordered the crispy calamari ($11), which comes with red peppers, onion, and spicy tomato basil sauce.  While the crispy prosciutto was good, the fresh mozzarella was more watery than I'd like.  I'm not a huge calamari fan, so I'm not the most objective judge of calamari, but it wasn't as crispy as I'd like, and I wasn't a fan of the spicy elements--though I get that they were included to add flavor.  For our entrees, we ordered the following from the pasta menu: tagliatelle ($18), braised rabbit risotto ($14), and wild mushroom risotto ($12).  The tagliatelle was quite al dente, to the point that my friend who ordered it was wondering if it was cooked properly.  He became accustomed to it eventually, and enjoyed it after that.  I can't speak for the braised rabbit risotto, as I didn't try it.  However, I can speak for the wild mushroom risotto, which I ordered, and it was severely underseasoned.  Because our table didn't have salt and pepper shakers, I (miraculously) caught our waiter's attention when he was waiting on the table next to us and asked for some.  The addition of salt and pepper greatly improved the dish--even then, though, it was 3.5 star quality at best.  As expected, when finished our dinner, we sat for a good 10-15 min. waiting for the check.  Fed up with waiting at this point, I got up and approached the bar, where our waiter was working, and firmly requested the check.  It was at this point when I realized that our waiter was actually the bartender, and that the restaurant was understaffed.  Out of goodwill, we tipped 15%--needless to say, the actual deserved tip was much less.  In his defense, he did make a delicious French 75--though, not to sound like a cocktail snob, but it was served in a martini glass instead of the proper highball glass.  For those keeping track at home, we spent 1.5 hours from arrival to departure.  Needless to say, we were less than impressed, and won't be returning until they up the ante with the food and get the service under control, esp. at this price point.",

We ordered are Favorite meals but that's about where the great evening ended. Quality of food and the service has gone down so dramatically that we are extremely disappointed.   Granted they are under new ownership now but that should not have affected the quality of food or the service. We decide to give Lucca a break for about a month or so and we went back this evening for 6:30 PM reservation.     We called the restaurant to inform them that we are going to be about 15 minutes late due to extremely bad traffic and they said sure no problem and we made sure that they knew we were sitting outside for our reservation and they acknowledge that.   We got there at 6:40 and found out they gave our table away and claimed they had no seats available inside for us.   Unfortunately this will be the last time we ever pay Lucca another visit.  This used to be a great place to eat and unwind but with all of the great competition in Pittsburgh I see a sad ending for Lucca.",

Lucca was a last minute change and turned out to be quite the dining experience. Peyton masterfully guided us on a smooth tour of the food and wine menu. We started with perfect mixed dirty martinis and excellent appetizer recommendations of gastronimo and mussels. We elegantly danced on to a recommended bottle of cabernet to accompany our entrees, each of which were crafted with care and creativity. After dinner, Peyton waltzed us through a carefully selected dessert menu and dipped us oh so gently to the perfect desserts and drinks to pair. What started as a reservation on a whim turned into a glorious yacht cruise captained by Peyton. Highest recommendations for both the restaurant and for our server.",

However, we heard it recently changed ownership which may explain the changes during our most recent visit.  Sadly, it would appear as though profits has become most important as the portion sizes have decreased significantly.  The meatballs in the Alla Cittarra are a fraction of what they once were.  The food wasn't even warm.  The bread in the bread basket now resembles the size  of croutons rather than actual bread slices.  Even something as simple as lemon slices for water are so thin one can see through them.  It's disappointing to see a restaurant go downhill so quickly.

My duck breast was okay--although I agreed to take it medium, after trying it, I really would have preferred well done. The vegetables on the side were savory and delicious. DH opted for the spaghetti and meatballs and was not particularly impressed. However, he did think the spiced chocolate mousse we shared was the best thing he ate all night. I agree it was good. We left full but not stuffed, without leftovers, so it was a little surprising to receive a bill for more than $30 per person (more than $40 with tip).

We waited half an hour for the appetizer and an hour for the entrees. The server said she would bring some bread but never did until I asked again because I was starving. Finally the food come but tasted really bad. My risotto was undercooked and some scallops were not fresh. Food far too overpriced and service is so slow. Would never come back again",

The short rib was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor. For dessert, I had the lave cake with ice cream. While the cake was not anything special the homemade gelato was amazing.",

I was in town for business this past weekend and decided to try a local spot with colleagues. I am originally from Tuscany, but now line in NYC and let me tell you that this place was a disaster.  For starters the burrata was subpar and the vinegar was of the lowest quality. It totally ruined our dish.  The bistecca was fatty and totally inedible. The butternut squash ravioli was so gummy that my gums stuck together. The \"Scottish\"  salmone was also very fatty. A True foodie knows that wild salmon has barely any fat. The plating of the food looked like it came straight out of a restaurant from NYC's Little Italy. So insulting and misleading. This is not Tuscan cuisine, rather it's Italian American masquerading as Italian.   I guess that's what happens when you eat in an area where Dominos, Papa John's and Olive Garden are considered Italian restaurants.   Che peccato!",

The food is fantastic - Authentic Italian. I would highly recommend any of the pasta dishes. Their menu does change, but your sure to find any dish well worth the visit. I am always disappointed when a restaurant doesn't add the wine list to their website. Lucca has a well balances list that will complement any food choice. I am more of a white wine drinker. The Spaghettini or the Fettuccine with a good Chardonnay would make an excellent choice. I like any of the salads with added chicken.  They do have a great list if your someone who enjoys a glass or bottle with your meal.   I have had no issues with the service. I have always been treated with prompt, friendly service. Lucca does offer discounts when you can find them. I think the prices are reasonable for the location and the quality of food received.",

I met the waitstaff who were already nicely setting the patio up for us and the evening manager Saurav, who assured us all would be perfect. Our party of 40 arrived almost all at once which seemed not to be a problem for the kitchen, waiters or bar.  We were treated very well and all thought the appetizers Crispy Prosciutto, Calamari, and Bruschetta were delicious. For a first course we had the Caprese salad, Arugula salad and Caesar which were all very fresh.  The meals of Tuscan Chicken, Veal Parmesean, Sea Scallops, and Fettucini, all came out with impeccable timing, hot, and again really yummy.  We kept the dessert simple with Rasberry Sorbet or Chocolate Gellato, which all were glad because the portions had been generous and we were all feeling full.  I can't say enough about the respectful service we recieved and how good the food was, as well as the price being fair.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will most definetely return to Lucca Ristorante and Wine Bar.",

The atmosphere when you enter is nice and it also has a nice outdoor patio for the summer.  However, the quality of the food is not as expected.  To be more precise, the value for money is not good.  While the food is decent, with fair entrees and a fairly good variety, the place is overpriced.  I would assume that this is due to the lack of other alternatives around for similar occasions, but in general I try to avoid this place for that reason.  Again, not that I do not enjoy the food and atmosphere when I go, but it is nothing spectacular to justify the prices.",

    "text": "My daughter and I went to Lucca hoping to find a quality Italian restaurant to frequent when her father and I come for visits while she's at U-PITT for the next four years.  We made a reservation for 6:30 on a Saturday night, arrived a little early at 6:15.  We were seated promptly, but coldly, by the \"host\" on duty; the restaurant was mostly empty.  After being seated and ordering drinks, my Pinot Grigio came in a dirty glass covered with food remnants.  This was corrected after sending it back, no big deal to me as this can happen.  The waiter, the same man who seated us, never bothered to tell us about specials or speak to us at all except to ask what we wanted to order.  Actually when I asked what the specials were he told me what the soup was.  The bruschetta appetizer was very flavorful, but on the menu it was to be crusty, it was very soft, but excellent flavor.  I asked the waiter's recommendation between the Fettuccine and the Linguini, he was certain the linguini was better.  It came out over cooked and very bland.  My daughter's gnocchi was great.  Being Italian, flavor is very important, if I need to add spice, it's no good.  I could not eat it.  The waiter finally came around after about an hour wait to see if we wanted boxes.  I said no, my daughter said yes and we ordered dessert to go.  When we got back to the hotel, no Gnocchi!  The chocolate lava cake was not heated and was just not good, my daughter's lemon tort was freezer burned, and hardly tasted of lemon, but the cake consistency was good.  We chose this restaurant based on location and decent prior reviews.  The food being hit and miss was one thing, but a horrid, uncaring waiter is unacceptable.  Other waiters seemed great and other customers seemed happy.  I usually tip over 25% having, waited tables in college, even for mediocre service.  I still gave an undeserved 10%, but looking back wish I'd have left nothing. This person needs training or to be let go, along with the dish washers and management.  After sending a dirty glass back someone should come apologize, after not being able to eat a meal, yet paid for it, management should have sprung into action.  Very sad to give a bad review, I was expecting so much better.",

We showed the coupon to the waiter and asked if we could use it on salads (since we wanted a light lunch and these were plate size salads). We were told yes. However, after we ate the waiter refused to honor what he had told us. He apologized and stated that the manager said we could not use the coupon since the salad we ordered did not have meat on it. I asked to speak to a manager. I tried to explain to the manager that we had specifically asked about the coupon before ordering and that my companion had limited funds. He became very angry and raised his voice at us. People began to stare which made both of us feel very awkward. I then asked (very politely I might add, because I was working and not allowed to lose my temper) that they charge us for a salad with meat at the bogo price, even though we did not receive meat. This suggestion really seemed to enrage him and so I quickly said nevermind and please just have the waiter return with the bill (which he had taken with him when he went to find the manager). The waiter never returned with our bill. We sat there (my client very visibly shaken with tears in her eyes as she does not handle confrontation like this well) for over five minutes before getting up and going to the podium where people enter in hopes of being able to pay our bill. My client was so upset I had to write an incident report! Maybe the manager was just having a bad day, but it was extremely inappropriate behavior. I should state that this happened a year ago, so this man may no longer work here. What a shame though, because I actually really liked the restaurants atmosphere and, though pricey, the food was good :(",
