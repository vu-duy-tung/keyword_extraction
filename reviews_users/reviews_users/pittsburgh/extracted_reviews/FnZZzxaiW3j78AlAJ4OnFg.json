Not one of those normal downtown shops where everyone is shoulder to shoulder moving like cattle.       I had the blue cheese burger and chili cheese fries. Good luck with that. The chili cheese fries were probably 2lbs and the burger was at least a 1/2lb patty on a large buttery toasty bun sided with chips and pickle. I did what little damage I could do to this meal and grabbed a to go bag. The blue cheese burger was great. The broil it with the cheese on to brown it a bit. The chili cheese fries were real chili topped with a few slices of American cheese. I was a little off put about their cheese choice but it turned out pretty good.      All in all this place is legit and I will be returning soon",

Sometimes though, I just want some good ol' fashion American comfort food and that's when I turn to the Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe.  A breakfast and lunch spot located on Western Ave, the Allegheny Sandwich Shop makes delicious, straight forward breakfast classics, home made soups, a damn fine chili, and awesome sandwiches. I'll even go as far to say that they make the best rueben in the city.   One thing that I love about this place is that for the most part you can order anything on the menu at any time during the day. I've been know to wake up on a Saturday morning feeling less stellar. Knowing that I can come here and get a coffee, water, and a hot roast beef sandwich with fries and gravy at 9:30 in the morning makes the occasional hangover a hell of a lot easier to deal with.   Do yourself a favor some beautiful weekend and come to the Northside, go for a walk through the park, and come to Allegheny Sandwich Shop to satisfy whatever craving you may have.",

    "text": "I love discovering new places in our beautiful city!  My visit to the Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe was the result of me having to wait on someone that had an appointment nearby.  I wanted breakfast really really bad.  Like, I really really wanted it.  You know that feeling when you just want what you want, right? Of course, I come here to see what my trusted Yelp buddys have to say about the good eats in the area.  I take a look at the comments for this place and I'm sold.   Parking in this area is never good, nor easy to figure out.  I know the sign says free parking across the street but, yeah, I just didn't get it.  Anyway, I ended up parking in the alley that is right beside the restaurant...problem solved.  I walked in and was immediately greeted by a smiling lady behind the counter.  The place is clean and cozy.  It's small but not uncomfortable...it's just right.  I asked where I should sit and she told me to sit wherever I liked.  She gave me a menu and I took a gander at all of the yummy offerings.  I decided to go with my first craving, which was breakfast.  They have breakfast bowls, combos, omelets, a la carte items, etc.  I was really surprised to see steak, eggs, potatoes and toast for under $9 and I was tempted but I ended up going for the swiss and mushroom omelet that came with home fries (made with red potatoes:), toast and coffee.  While the food was good, it wasn't very hot when it arrived which is my only reason for deducting a star.  I overheard another patron ask if her food could be warmed up in the microwave so it might just be a timing thing.  The coffee was DELICIOUS and the waitress was on her game, checking in with me periodically and keeping my cup filled.  While I was eating, the waitress and hostess were talking to all of us diners and it was very light hearted and fun.  They really made me feel welcomed here.  My meal was less than $6 and it was a nice sized portion and I ended up taking half of it home.    It goes without saying, I will be back.  Hopefully to try one of the burgers or specials on the menu or...maybe I'll grab a cup of Joe.  Yes, it was really that good!",

There weren't any tables available when we arrived but they noticed us right away and let us know a good place to wait.  They gave our daughter crackers to keep her entertained for the couple minutes until a table was available.  The food was very tasty, came in good time and was very affordable.  There wasn't a kids menu but they had grilled cheese which works just fine for us.  I had the Italian sub and my wife had the Dagwood, both excellent.  We are really glad we found this place after visiting the National Aviary (less than a mile away) and would definitely recommend it. :)",

The Allegheny Sandwich shoppe is everything wonderful about pittsburgh in one spot.  Once walking in the customers and staff were so very nice.  It was like being transported back to a small town diner long before cell phones,  people were talking and not a single electronic device could be seen.  Amazing!  I ordered three eggs over medium, home fries, and toast.  While waiting I really enjoyed soaking in the atmosphere, listening to the conversations and humming along to the faint music playing.  Once the food came I went right at it.  The eggs were close to perfect looking with a hint of real butter,  the home fries were crispy with a more distinct butter taste.  The toast was great for dipping and of course lots of butter.  It had that feel like my southern grandma had made it. Staff 5 out 5 Atmosphere 5 out 5 Food 4 out 5 (just a bit too much butter) I would call it a 4.75..... but let's round this one up! I would recommend to friends and I'll be back",

They weren't very busy, but the food still took 40 minutes. Then my wife's eggs, which she asked for extra well so there was no runny yolk, came out barely cooked at all. We had to send them back, and after another 15 minutes they came back out, almost just as bad. In addition, she had asked for toast dry and extra toasted. The first time it came as bread, not even toasted. The second time it came buttered. The third time, it came barely toasted again, but at this point we just wanted to leave. My omelet could have been good... but I ate it cold as I waited for my wife's food. It didn't make matters any better than the waitress rolled her eyes at us when we sent the food back. I highly doubt we will be back.",

Had the potential to be good...if my order would have came out right the first time...or the 2nd time...3rd time is the charm? Not so much... I ordered 3 eggs poached hard, dry rye toast double toasted and a fruit cup. We waited about 40 min for our food. But we didn't mind, our coffee was filled. When my order came the eggs were runny, toast was cold and fruit had granola on top. I could have dealt with the fruit and toast but runny eggs are a no no. I sent them back and the waitress insisted on new fruit too. My husband and I waited another 20 min or so and they finally came back with my order, toast buttered.  I sent that back and it came back barely toasted.  The order was wrong twice and we barely even got an apology. No kudos on customer service.  That in itself doesn't get our business again.",

    "text": "I know this phrase is overused on Yelp, but this place is a hidden gem!  If you're looking for a cute little place on the North Side to grab some casual, delicious diner-style breakfast or lunch eats, look no further!  CM and I stopped by yesterday at 12:30pm for lunch on the way to the Mattress Factory, since we didn't have cash, ruling out my first choice (Wilson's BBQ).  Despite being my second choice, this sweet little sandwich shoppe (love the old-timey spelling, BTW!) exceeded our expectations.  Based on the recommendation of our waitress, I ordered the blueberry pancake special ($5.09), and a side order of home fries ($1.50).  My order came with three good-sized pancakes packed with delicious, juicy whole blueberries, topped with a ribbon of whipped cream.  The last time I received pancakes with this many blueberries was at Dutch Eating Place in RTM in Philly!  The pancakes themselves were of a nice consistency--not too thick or thin, or too light or heavy--just right.  My only wish was that there was more whipped cream--but then again, my waistline is thanking me for not flagging down the waitress to ask for more.  The home fries were cooked just right, with a hint of crispness on the outside, and were further enhanced by some additional salt/pepper seasoning and hot sauce.  CM ordered the chicken breast sandwich, Cajun style ($6.95), which was topped with lettuce and tomatoes, and came with a side of chips and a mayonnaise-y dipping sauce.  Because he was still feeling under the weather, I didn't sample it, but he was very pleased with it--although he did tell me it wasn't very spicy. (But then again, this is Bland-burgh...)  Despite our arrival half an hour before closing, our waitress was convivial, assuring us that we could take our time eating and not rushing us out the door.  Based on their interactions with the employees, many of the other customers appeared to be regulars, which speaks well of this place's loyalty among the locals.  I only wish they were open past 1pm on Saturdays, since it would be nice to be able to feast on breakfast food and sandwiches later into the afternoon.  Our check came to $13.54--extremely reasonable, in light of the quality of the food received. Personally, I think this place is much better than Peppi's. 4.5 stars.",

They don't have gourmet sandwiches or breakfast, but they have such an old fashioned feel to the restaurant, and they serve the staples, and do it well.   We've gone for breakfast and it was amazing.  The best part?? They GRIND their own coffee there, so they have the best coffee of any breakfast place I've tried.  They have an amazing reuben sandwich (with REAL turkey in it, which isn't standard, but was an amazing addition to this classic!) and their omelettes are great.  But that COFFEE!  This is our favorite place for a saturday morning, lazy, affordable breakfast.  We just went back for lunch and their bread is really great - solid and sturdy!  The sandwiches have a good amount of meat in them, the BLT was really good (we added an egg) and the bacon was crisp and copious.  Their brewed iced tea is to die for - so refreshing!   To make it even better, their staff is excellent.  We're always seated really quickly, and we've been waited on twice by Joy who is utterly delightful.  If you're having a bad day, you might as well go down there, get a cup of coffee and talk to Joy - she is such a ray of sunshine, so helpful and really courteous.  All in all, we ADORE this place.  It is nothing fancy, but it is solid, secure, quaint and everything you could want for a great lunch under $20.",

I ended up going to the Allegheny Sandwich Shop for breakfast on Saturday and it might be the best dedication I made all month. This small little diner establishment has easy to access street parking, a good amount of tables to sit at, and a fantastic menu with all sorts of different breakfast choices to choose from. I didn't dine in because I was on the go but I placed my order at the front counter and staff was super duper friendly when I was there (we even had a nice chat about our fluffy dogs). The food came out in no time and when I opened up the container I almost had a heart attack.....why? Well, because the meat scramble I ordered looked absolutely amazing, and guess what? It tasted just as good as it looked. The mixture of the meat, eggs, and veggies made something that Zeus himself would of enjoyed to eat.   Overall, I absolutely loved the Allegheny Sandwich Shop and it kind of sucks that they aren't located in Buffalo. The staff was amazing and so was the food, I highly recommend giving this place a try, you won't be disappointed!",

They have a nice extended menu of sandwich varieties and a good mix of breakfast items. It's so good, that us out-of-towners came here twice for breakfast, when we could have tried a new breakfast shop during our limited time there.   Both times I ordered the breakfast combo, which comes with the choice of two meats, with egg and toast. For me, that's the perfect plate for a substantial breakfast to get us energized and lasting for hours before lunch. Personally, I did not like the sausage links as much. The sausage mixture just wasn't appealing to my particular palate -- although, my fiance loved it.  Definitely worth checking out!",

The other sever (birthday girl) was super attentive to her customers. We were a little jelly.   We probably sat for 5-10 min before the owner came by and asked if we were taken care of. I said no but would love coffee. He brought out two cups and all was better. For another who knows how long.   The owner gave us a couple of pieces of cake probably to get us to relax as they were taking a super long time to take our order and then to bring food.   Anyway, they have a new cook and the food was ok. My eggs were over easy when I asked for over med (hate the slimy egg whites - eck!)  I guess the cubs shirt didn't help either. Possibly the reason why our server wasn't as attentive to us as her other customers. Like she came out with coffee and refilled the table across from us but never even looked at us.   Actually the birthday server was nicer to us once I was able to wish her a happy bday. Anyway, maybe grumpy was having a bad day.   Definitely not coming back especially since there McDonald's up the street. They bring your food to the table as well.",

I got a western scramble and my boyfriend got the garden scramble. They were huge portions and so yummy. Nothing unusual to order here, but they definitely do the basics well!",

    "text": "This a super sweet, local small business nestled in the middle of the North Side. The owners and staff are very welcoming - you feel like a regular while eating here!   My coworkers and I come to the sandwich shoppe every other week for lunch. The service is always quick and the food is usually delicious.   This particular visit was on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was PACKED, so bear that in mind if you plan on going on a week day.   Their Friday soup special is a clam chowder and I can honestly say it was the best I've ever had. The cup was overflowing when my waitress brought it to the table - their portions are always huge here. I ordered their Three Rivers Rueben as my main dis and I was not that impressed. I fancy myself a Rueben connoisseur and this one just seemed greasy and not flavorful. The ratio of corn beef and turkey breast was off, as well - too much turkey and not enough corn beef. Definitely not their best sandwich. I'd go for the Triple Decker Club or Fish Sandwich (those never disappoint).   Overall, I love the charm of the sandwich shoppe and recommend it for a quick, filling lunch.",

    "text": "Delicious.    Stopped in today for lunch. I work on the north side now (goodbye Cranberry!!!!!!). My job is affiliated with a school so most of the time I head to the teachers lounge for free lunch. I had a late meeting today and had to head out for lunch. A trusty yelp search lead me here!  The inside is cute! It has a few tables & a counter. Looks very similar to a diner. The menu is a mix of sandwiches, burgers and salads... Except a really good menu of not so plain jane sandwiches. Most sandwiches cone with a bag of chips and range to be about $9-10. At first i was upset that sandwiches didn't come with fries, but while waiting on my to-go order, I saw some sandwiches come out. Wow they were huge!!  I ordered the north side grill. It was served on Texas toast and had a huge amount of deli turkey. (Or ham?! Crap. I'm a horrible reviewer) it also had sauteed mushrooms + 3 different cheese (wow!)  Sandwich was good (& huge) but next time I will try something different. Very cheesy yet dry. Needed mayo or something. Idk  Overall delicious . its only open til 230 by the way. They take cards",

    "text": "Best breakfast sausage of my life! Seriously. This place wins - the flavor was on point. They were sizzling hot and still tender on the inside. If that's all you need to get you to visit this place, then I've done my job.   We came for breakfast after finding it on Yelp as we hunted for a good diner-style spot. The place was packed - likely because there was a Pitt football game and everyone who wasn't tailgating was eating here. Right as we walked in, a table opened up. We just missed the wait. Phew! The server was visibly exhausted and it was barely 10am so we ordered coffees quickly as we scoured the menu. It looked like the place was full of locals and the server did not want to entertain my hemming and hawing over what to order - everything looked good, how do I decide? Skillets, breakfast BLT!? Do they have specials? I still don't know. The pressure was on so I went for the classic option to determine a diner's skill set - 2 eggs over easy, toast and sausage. I immediately felt regret like I didn't order right, but when my breakfast was placed before me, my concerns floated away. It was simple, yet perfect. The eggs were just right with runny yolks for dipping the most crispy sour dough toast, and the sausage. Eye heart emojis forever. I also stole a few bites of homefries from my boyfriend's plate because they looked crispy (I hate a soft homefry) and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. He devoured his western omelet and we departed soon after for a day of city exploring. This was a hearty meal that kept us full past lunch time.  For a no nonsense, well prepared diner breakfast, this place is it!",

I finally visited on a day off from work and again, I wish they had longer hours!  By the looks on the outside and the name including the words \"sandwich shop,\" you wouldn't know it but this place is more like a diner serving up breakfast and lunch. For a Friday afternoon, this place was packed for lunch.   Hubby got the Reuben and I got the Hot Roast Beef.  What made these sandwiches delicious was definitely the buttery bread. The portions here are humongous! Good thing I was off that day or I never would have been able to make it back to work with a lunch this large. The prices are also super affordable.   Overall, I really liked this place. It's just hard finding the time to catch their hours of operation.",
