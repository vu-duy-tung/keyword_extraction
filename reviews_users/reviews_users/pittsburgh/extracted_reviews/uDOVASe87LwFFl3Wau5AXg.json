    "text": "Decided to try this place for breakfast as it just recently opened. I will say it really is a nice place, staff seemed very friendly and excited to be working there. Now for what's important, the food... Two of us ordered Pancakes one with a side of fruit and the third person ordered eggs over with the \"bacon steak\". I must say this restaurant has out done themselves. This was the first time in my life i actually needed to use a fork and knife to eat pancakes. Normally for anyone who's eaten pancakes before know they can be cut with just the fork themselves, so just wow for that point alone. What was even better was watching the table across from me eating the pancake like it was a slice of pizza, it should go with out saying, but i would not recommend the pancakes. The plus side was the Fruit was fresh! The third dinner who ordered the eggs and bacon enjoyed their meal, but did admit the bacon was too thick. They described it as thick bacon but really it's just pork belly. It was good but definitely not what one thinks of as bacon for breakfast. I was willing to come back and try lunch or dinner, but was turned off by the fact that they had CNN on the TV. If your gonna have the TV on, the local news would suffice. I don't need to be aggravated while eating my Sunday breakfast. I do wish the owners all the best, but i for one will not be back.",

I heard that this was a new, hot joint so I figured I had to check it out. For the most part, I was impressed. However, there was a woman at the hostess stand named Hannah (I think) who was extremely rude and short with us. The people at your hostess stand really set the vibe for the rest of the meal so this was extremely disappointing. Had to take away 2 stars. I'd recommend a more friendly head of house. Probably will visit again though. :/",

    "text": "I understand this is a new business and being in restaurant management myself I am extremely forgiving. Especially when it comes to the normal kinks you have when opening a new business. One thing that I can't overlook is poor customer service. A friend and I stopped in on a busy Friday night. We really liked the bar atmosphere so we headed over that way. When noticing that the bar top was full we decided to sit a one of the cocktail tables next to the bar. I approached the hostess and told her we were sitting at one of the cocktail tables next to the bar and did we need to grab our drinks from the bar or would a server we around. She informed me that there was a server that would be over. After patiently waiting about 15 minutes we started looking around with no sign of anyone coming over to wait on us. At the same time I observe 2 other drinkless tables doing the same. Finally a server walked by and one of the other guests got her attention and asked to place a drink order. She was very polite but said she was not in that area and that they didn't have a server for the cocktail tables. The guest told her that they were, like us, told their was. She said she'd send someone over but after another ten minutes no one came. I approached the hostess and again to clarify what she told me about a server being in that area. She told me \"I must have misunderstood her\" because they didn't have one over there. I know that I heard her correctly...as did the 3 other tables that were told the same thing.  At that point we were ready to walk out. We decided to at least stay for one drink and went up to the bar to grab one. The bartender seemed really put out when we asked for a drink menu. Then my friend asked him if there were any happy hour specials going on. I don't think that was an unusual question. He made it very clear he was annoyed by that question and acted all arrogant and made the extremely rude and inappropriate comment \"this ain't TGI Friday's\".  I was so taken back and appalled by his attitude! It was if he was trying to say that \"upscale\" restaurants would never have happy hour specials and we should have known that. Meanwhile..I've traveled the world and been to plenty of establishments that would make this \"upscale\" restaurant look like a casual dining restaurant...and they have had drink specials at happy hour. We didn't even care if they did or didn't...we were just inquiring if they did and were made to feel like we were fools for asking! Needless to say...we left after our drink and went somewhere else. I also observed several of the guests sitting in the cocktail area get up and leave because they were frustrated that they couldn't get a drink. Good friendly service can make or break an establishment.  I would never return to a place after being treated so rudely. It's a shame because I loved the set up of the bar and it looks like they have a great patio too! Oh well!",

I refused to go back until tonight hoping they changed things for the better. However I ordered a beer that came in a 6oz glass for $8! Then my salmon that I ordered was terrible. It had no flavor at all. My total bill came to $125 which was not worth it at all. I recommend avoiding this place at all costs. Don't let the ambiance fool you into going there.",

A group of us went for the crab leg special (which we have done in the past and it's great) well this time one round in they ran out of crab legs.  :(   It's not the norm and we all know sometimes things happen.  Of course we were disappointed but the management and staff held themselves completely accountable, sincere apologies, and they brought out excellent food (on them) to rectify the mistake. Sadly this kind of customer service and accountability isn't seen as often as it should in this day and age.  Well the Lot stepped up and we still had a great meal.   Now we just need to schedule another Tuesday dinner because we can't get enough of the crab legs. Haha.",

The butternut squash bisque came out as more of a soup consistency and weirdly had pomegranate seeds hiding at the bottom.  It was strange and not good.   For a main course we tried the Lamb Chops and the Veal with a side of Brussel sprouts.  All three of these were done very well and we enjoyed them immensely.  The service was fair to poor as our server was not particularly attentive.   I will go back and give the steaks a shot as well as the Cigar Bar which was very crowded and very smokey (fix the air cleaners) when I took a peak.",

    "text": "Let me start by stating that I have traveled the world and dined at countless places from greasy-spoon Mom & Pop's to the finest 5 Star establishments in NYC, Paris, London, Sydney, L.A., etc. and well... Pittsburgh.  I'm actually being liberal with my 2 stars because I allow for some forgiveness being that this restaurant is fairly new and probably working out some kinks.  1) Called in to check the wait time and hostess snapped at us when we asked if we could put our name in for call ahead, \"I'm not going to take your name - I'll take it when you get here.\" (said with a REAL attitude) 2) Upon arriving was looked up and down by hostess (young lady with buzzed, short dark hair). When I asked for the wait time, again with attitude she told me 30 minutes and gave me a dirty look as if that was a long time and she wanted to turn away our business. NOT GOOD! 3) Decided to sit and dine at the bar with two friends. Our first round of drinks were just okay, but for $10 - $12 for a cocktail expectation is that they will at least taste good. Like, how do you mess up a skinny margarita with premium tequila? 4) Salad & main courses came out separately for all 3 of us. In fact, my two friends were almost done with their dinner before I got mine. 5) The Caesar salad was just plain gross. The brussels sprouts were undercooked and like eating raw with a tiny bit of char. The linguini was odd and small portion for an entree. Again, with the prices being comparable to a much finer restaurant, we expected more. 6) The braised short rib entree was delicious, but don't expect your typical shredded/pulled meat - these are actual cubed rib meat. 7) Swordfish atop risotto was also amazingly good. 8) My friend who is a huge gin drinker wanted to try a new gin, but the bartender struggled to find a list, offer suggestions and/or even bring a few bottles over. He was lost. Another clearly, more tenured bartender stepped in and made it right by finding the list and also letting us taste two different gins - of which we then ordered 2 more drinks for a nightcap.  And finally, when the bill came it was $146 for 2 of us and the bartender actually charged  $0.93 cents for \"margarita mix\" after already charging for the top-shelf tequila that I requested. Really??? Tacky...  All this being said, I hope the place does well and works out some of its issues, but being rude and not being welcomed with a warm smile and good attitude is inexcusable... especially in a small community like Oakmont/Verona.",

Lots of TVs - probably too many for this style of restaurant, in my opinion - but otherwise great atmosphere.  Service is excellent - our server was very friendly, attentive, and thoughtful.  She even offered us coffee to go after bringing the check!  I got the build-your-own omelette with bacon tomato and cheddar - eggs were perfectly done and bacon was diced thick and crispy.  My wife got the salmon toast and acai bowl - the salmon toast was good but had an oil drizzled on it that we felt was unnecessary.  The acai bowl was very good, with fruits and granola, made me wish I had gotten it myself.  We both had decaf coffee and it was exceptional, considering that we are both decaf drinkers who normally have a very hard time finding decent decaf in restaurants.  They seem to have a very nicely stocked bar and we're looking forward to sampling it sometime soon, along with their dinner menu.  Since this place is within walking distance from our house in Verona, I'm sure we'll be making many more trips back here.  Great addition to the Oakmont-Verona area!",

Their potatoes are amazing, supposedly there is garlic in the potatoes but couldn't taste it........they did not need it. I ordered the avocado toast with a fried egg on top. Visually it was as good as it tastes, hard to eat but very good. I ended up using a knife and fork after fighting the avocado to stay under the egg. We also ordered the thin and crispy pancakes with fresh fruit and real maple syrup, very good as well. My only complaint is the wait, they seated us at 10:45 am and we didn't get our food until 11:50. Not to mention in that hour and five minutes my coffee cup was only filled twice and I had to track down the waitress both times. She was very nice and friendly but didn't pay us much attention until we started to get hangry.  Overall good and I will definitely give it another try  Update: went back a few times for dinner and it was great, I am upgrading my rating to four stars.

    "text": "I visited this new establishment yesterday evening with a friend. We had already perused the menu ahead of time and thought it was perhaps a little overpriced for this market.  We were drawn to the spacious bar area and several cocktail tables available for 2-4 guests.  We asked the hostess if we could sit at the cocktail tables and be served and we were told yes.  After about 15 min. of waiting and noticing that other tables were still waiting, my friend approached the hostess again and apparently we were not going to be waited on.  Several employees and what appeared to be the roving manager/owner noticed our table as well as a few others with no beverages, menus, etc., but nothing was done to accommodate us or direct us to the bar for drinks/menus.  At this point, I was ready to leave. There were no seats available at the bar and it just set a bad tone.  I understand that new places take a while to get a feel and iron out the wrinkles, but this is basic customer service.  When I approached the bartender, I recognized him from working at two other restaurant's.  To me, this is a compliment, that I remembered him and this is his craft.  He barely acknowledged the comment and was quick to dismiss it.  I made a comment about the cocktail tables not having waitstaff and he said \"we are two weeks old\", as if that should affect basic organization, customer service and accurate communication to guests!  I did not feel welcomed in this place in the least.  At the very end there was one server who asked if we needed anything.  This may have happened because other guests were walking out and they finally realized that this is not good for business or repeat business!  It was too late and we decided to head to another establishment down the road.  Funny, because we saw 3 other groups at the other place because they had left The Lot.  We get the point on the trendy look, but without good service that really doesn't matter a whole lot.  I was really hoping this would be a new regular joint for me since there aren't many places of this caliber in the area.  I just left feeling hugely disappointed and will most likely not return.",

We were so pleased with our sandwich choices. The PO Boy Lobster sandwich has huge pieces of tempura style lobster with sauteed veggies and tasty sauce. The Veggie Sandwich is perfect blend of asparagus, avocado, arugula and more on the best rye bread ever. The Reuben Pfeffer was actually house made pastrami with shredded Brussel sprouts (instead of sauerkraut ). Great tasting on the rye bread. Even the avocado toast came With a surprise egg on top. All yummy. Lots of other great choices on the menu and would definitely recommend and go back.",

They have a seemingly appealing menu, and they're trying really hard to be trendy and hip, but it doesn't do anything for them when the food is less than mediocre. The Caesar salad is blah. The dressing is a tasteless mixture of maybe milk, lemon and oil. The croutons taste like they've been sitting in a plastic Tupperware container for days. And then they top it off with \"roasted tomatoes\" which are just mushy and heavy and don't work at all on a salad. I've also had the wedge salad, which is tossed with a tasteless buttermilk dressing and tasteless prosciutto. Hey chef - add some Bleu Cheese or Gorgonzola and give that salad some flavor.   As for atmosphere, it's attractive and trendy, but they always seat us in these half-moon booths that are awkward when wanting to just sit and chat with a coworker. Also - servers are nice enough, but just really damn slow. I don't need to spend an hour and a half at your restaurant for lunch.",

Minimal and hipster.  There is a nice sitting area for coffee and chatting.    The breakfast and lunch menu are pretty interesting (avacado toast to egg plates) and reasonably priced.  We had a typical egg breakfast and Belgian waffles.  The egg plate was stellar and the waffles were interesting.  The flavor of the batter was great, but the texture was a little too cracker-y.  Our service was great, Elijah was on it.  Not overbearing, but personable and fun.  I want to check it out for lunch. (and smoke some cigars in the cigar bar)",

The dining experience is really nice, and there seems to be a lot of menu options for different dietary needs. I like the atmosphere inside.  There are outside and inside seating options when the weather is right. The second time I went we were seated outside. This is not my preference as I hate outdoors and summer. It was very hot out and I asked to be closer to the air conditioner. We were invited to move to a table right next to a large open window and could feel the air conditioning more. We were already seated outside and given to a server, so I didn't want to ask to move inside and mess up their seating chart more. If they were less busy I would have.  There is a cigar bar somehow connected to the restaurant, but fortunately you cannot smell any of the smoke. I get headaches from cigar smoke (even though I like the smell), so I'm pleased with this.  I plan to come back for lunch eventually.",

    "text": "What a huge disappointment...initially visited The Lot on the bar side, while waiting for a show.  Beautiful bar, great cocktails and the bartender was extremely friendly and engaging.  We couldn't wait to come back for a meal. Even excitedly shared our new find with friends.  This past weekend, we stopped by for lunch.  We were dismally greeted by a young woman that barely looked at us or spoke while she walked us to our booth. Kind of a let down, because we were excited to be back and so impressed by the beautiful dining area that had recently been decorated for the holiday.  Much to our shock, our waitress greeted us with the same cool demeanor and lack of poise or energy.    I unfortunately have to say that the food left us equally disappointed as the service.  The salad for $12 was tiny and served on a side plate, for an additional $6 I added a chicken breast that was flavorless and cold.  The $7 soup was supposed to be chilli,  it was delivered at the same time as our entrees (a huge annoyance) and was all broth...no meat or beans.  My husband ordered the Reuben that boasted house made pastrami, it was greasy and flavorless.  No cocktails ordered this time and our lunch was $49.  The entire experience was less than acceptable.  What a shame because it is open and lovely, with a beautiful industrial decor.  The other affiliated restaurants have NEVER disappointed.    Some Advice: Your staff has everything to do with delivering a good customer experience, personality and politeness are not over rated..the food is over priced for the quality and quantity that you serve.  Giving the 2 stars for the bartender and beautiful layout/decorations.",

    "text": "Review is based on two visits. Both experiences being for lunch. First lunch, based on the recommendation of a kitchen staff member (known to my lunch partner) and because the restaurant prides itself as a chop house, my lunch partner and I both ordered the hamburger. The burger was disappointing. Nothing special about it. The bun didn't hold up to the meat with both of us having to eat a burger with a fork, open-faced. BBQ chips came with the burger as a side. If these are made \"in-house\" I would be surprised. Everything about them said commercially produced.  The second lunch was a much improved experience. This time with my wife, we each ordered a different sandwich. The Roast Beef Dip and the other a BLT. I was already prepared to be underwhelmed. But ended up being pleasantly surprised by the flavor of both sandwiches. The sides still need some work. My wife order the BBQ chips, against my advice and had the same result....just OK. I had the fries and they were just OK as well. Since the sides are ordered separately and large enough for two, there really isn't any need to order two, especially if you're not going to finish them because they don't measure up.   But bottom line....as an Oakmont resident who hasn't been impressed with some of the other establishment this owner has in the area...I would say I would return and give it another try. Not sure about trying dinner yet. Seems rather expensive, unnecessarily so.",

The flavor was great, but the bread was not toasted enough and got soggy real fast.

    "text": "I've been twice. It's a nice atmosphere, both inside and on the patio, but both times I wasn't a huge fan of my food. First the chicken fried steak breakfast... was okay. Biscuits oddly textured (the cheese became chewy and the dough was very dense), steak was okay, gravy meh. Second time turkey club, way too big to actually eat it in one piece so no way to get turkey, cheese, avocado, and prosciutto in one bite. At the end, had a huge pile of extra turkey left, which was a bit dry and not great. I'd prefer a lot less meat on there and maybe throw in a free side... both times my husband got the burger and was happy with it. So I guess that's the safe bet! But the chips that come with it seemed burnt and not tasty. The second time he subbed fries and they were a little better, but still very dark. Maybe they need to clean the fryer?",

    "text": "Newly opened upscale American diner.  The decoration was chic.  We ordered shrimp cocktail it was a Jumbo size shrimps.   I ordered the iceberg salad, it was soooooo good.  The surprise element was the poppadew pepper (not sure if I spell it right) and we love it.  My fiance hate pepper and he loved those little ones.  He ordered the clam chowder, he said it was the best he ever had.    We could just be satisfied with just those 2 courses, but when the lamb chops were out, it was amazing.  It didn't taste the game from the lamb, the twice fried potatoes was a great add on the entree.  I had the braised short ribs, it was great as well.  Maybe just a tad too much fried onion, but the onion was a great on its own.     We noticed that the other reviewers didn't give this spot high review, which we were surprised since the food was very good, environment was chic, service is top notch.   We thought the food is 4.5 stars but our server Scott makes the experience to the 5.  Timing was impeccable, attentive to our drinks, follow up after a few bites, notice right away if our drinks need to refresh.  Great experience overall.",

    "text": "I wanted to give this establishment a 1 star review, but our meals were good and server Elijah was very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. I live in the area and wanted to try out The Lot and wanted to catch up with my friend, so we made plans to meet there last night (Friday 9/21). When I got there it was pouring down raining, so I called her and she was sitting in her car as well. After waiting it out I got out and proceeded into the restaurant. My friend already made it in and was speaking with one of the ladies at the front podium. My friend informed me that we had to find our own table since people ran in from the patio and took a seat at any table. We found a small table with two chairs in the back. We sat down a waiter came over and asked did we receive menus yet, he said he will get a hostess to get us menus. A woman a little on the heavy size, floral shirt, black pants and dark hair in a ponytail came over to us asking if we had reservations. Puzzled and confused we asked did we needed to make reservations because I looked on their website a couple days ago and I did not noticed anything about reservations. She left. The waiter came over and gave us menus since he noticed she never gave them to us. The \"hostess\" she comes back over (by this time I was annoyed and wanted to leave). I let my friend do the talking) the \"hostess\" very rudely stated \"next time you come in you have to wait for a hostess to sit you, you cannot just choose any table you want\". My friend said that lady over there told me to pick a table since people ran in from the patio because of the rain. She left and never came back. By this time we spend 25 minutes without ordering drinks or food. My friend and I decided we were going to leave and go to Carnivores, but it was a down pour again, so we stayed.   1. Our server gave us water. It was nasty and warm. 2. We asked questions about the menu, our server Elijah was very knowledgeable on the menu and made recommendations. I ended up ordering the Lamb Chops and my friend the grilled swordfish and a side of cream greens. We both ordered drinks me a classic margarita and my friend a white sangria. (Drinks was good) 3. We waited about 45 minutes for our food. A man and woman came out with our food. Elijah seemed puzzled that he went to the kitchen and our food already went out. He checked on us a good amount of times to make sure everything was fine.  4. The food was great! My lamb was well seasoned and prepared the way I like it (med well) and my friend's swordfish was grilled to perfection. I had lamb chops in Jamaica (Sandals) and at Savoy. This was the best lamb I ever had. The portion sizes was huge. 4 nice meaty size lamb chops and about an 8oz swordfish. My friend said the cream greens was just ok, but the risotto was excellent! 5. We was never asked if the check was separated. One check came out, so I paid it since it wasn't a big deal. The total was $102.72 with tip $114.72. I think it was a little pricey for the location, but I've paid more for less lamb chops.  6. Nice decor. Chic and modern. There's a cigar bar upstairs.  7. A live band was playing and it was a nice touch.   Even though the food was good, I might never return to this establishment again due to poor customer service from the \"hostess\". I'm a former manager for a international top kids clothing store and customer service is everything!  It can make or break a business. Their staff needs better training on customer service or they will not be around long.",

The \"Steak\" is not real Steak, it is roast beef. The \"Steak\" was marinated in something (sorry don't remember what, went here a month ago now), maybe even marinated too long.

    "text": "I love this place.  The food is awesome, the space is beautiful, the waiter is terrific.  I had the spinach salad with pecans and vinaigrette- they subbed goat cheese for gorgonzola for me.  The bloody mary is great.  I didn't care for the latte- it was very strong - I had to water it done a bit with cream. This is petty, but I am used to lattes having latte art on them (especially when they are $5).   The waiter with the muscles & tattoos is great. He is prompt, fast, accurate, accommodating, patient. We actually had the same waiter last time I was here in the summer and remember him because he is terrific.   Now the manager is another story. The lady who made our reservation specifically mentioned our group would \"be there for a while\" and was told that would not be a problem at all. Otherwise she would have picked another spot. Well, after 2 hours, the manager came over and asked us to leave. We were still ordering drinks & food, so it wasn't like we were monopolizing a table and sipping water. Our waiter was super cool about it. But the manager kept glaring at us. Then she had to set up another table for another large group (there was tons of room) and she was huffing & puffing & glaring. We stayed 3 hours. Now, I understand it was a Sunday, a very busy time for them. However, the way this was handled was classless & disgraceful. If there was a 2 hour time slot, she should have informed us when seated. Then we could have chosen to leave and go elsewhere or not at that time. There is a graceful way to handle getting customers to wrap up, and huffing, puffing, glaring is not graceful. As we were leaving, and walked by us, she said \"oh finally! We get rid of them!\" - um - we can hear you! And, she whirled around and stormed to the table and slammed right into me! She murmured a snarly \"sorry\" and stormed away. Everyone in my group was stunned! That was completely uncalled for!   Despite this, I still say I love this place, would recommend it, and would return. I wouldn't let one person's bad behavior change my opinion.",

It was a pretty good portion too- I was able to take half home for lunch the next day! Finished with the beneigts which were more like donuts (in terms of shape) but so tasty. I would recommend splitting them, it's a pretty large portion.   The prices fall in line with a \"nice\" restaurant but are still up there for an everyday meal.

The crab/pasta entree was significantly lacking in flavor and didn't match the description on the menu (forgetting chili flakes and adding asparagus) and, while flavorful, 2 small scallops doesn't make an entree.  The peach \"cobbler\" was also clearly just canned peaches with a crumble on top.  An unfortunate meal for a restaurant we have been excited to try.   To add on, at no point did anyone on staff ask if we were enjoying our meal ... pretty sure they knew that their restaurant week menu wasn't up to par. While other people's steaks looked nice, not sure if we can trust a second chance after such a poor first impression.",

Went inside (which also wasn't crowded) and lined up behind two other parties at the hostess desk. The young man there asked us if we had a reservation. No - for breakfast? In Oakmont? OK, there's not many folks here, so they should  be able to seat us soon, especially outside. \"There's one party ahead of you, so we should be able to seat you in about 20 minutes.\" This made no sense, and we almost left then, for one of the other nearby eateries where no reservation is required for a casual breakfast. Oh if only we had! The young man wrote our name down on the last available sliver of a Post-It note, then disappeared. About 20 minutes later, a young woman said our table ready, and lead us to a table, inside, beside the bar. My wife looked at me, & I said to her \"Don't fight it\". We took the table offered, while the patio remained largely vacant. We ordered omelettes, and waited bit longer than I would have preferred for our food to arrive. Our plates were delivered by someone from the kitchen, and mine was missing a side I had ordered.  My omelette was OK, a bit small, with good potatoes. My wife's egg white omelette was reportedly not good. It came with a side of greens that were obviously old, as were the side of mixed berries she ordered. Largely inedible. I'll try to post a pic. Gnats soon found the berries and loved them.  We were severely disappointed and won't be going back. If you're going to request reservations, have something worth coming in for. And get my table request right.",

    "text": "OK.  I have been coming here for breakfast since February of this year (2019) and in the beginning things were great.  One of the best breakfasts around at that time.  But now since they have lost their husband and wife chef team, things are in a state of flux.  The omelettes, which were fluffy and yellow are now flat and browned from the butter.  The toast is toasted on the edges only, the sausage keeps shrinking, the a la carte order of bacon is shrinking and the potatoes....let me tell you about the potatoes!!!!!!!  They started out as twice cooked potatoes, some smashed some almost intact, firm, sweet interior and an exterior that WAS out of this world.  The secret?  They were second cooked in bacon fat and butter.  They were heaven.   But what happened????? They caved...They CAVED big time.  To whom, you ask?  To a MINORITY and a scourge to restaurants known as vegetarians.  This is a Chop House, a Carnivour Palace...hell, another restaurant they own is called Carnivores.  The wittle bunnies didum wannum eatum does nasty potatoes wiff dat nasty wasty  animal fat on dem. Why would you bend over for vegetarians?  They are now prepared with Extra virgin olive oil and garlic.  They are mediocre at best. The pancakes, which were always a rip off of Pamela's were still good.  I ordered a stack recently and I COULD NOT CUT THEM WITH A KNIFE AND FORK.  The server offered to get me new pancakes but I wasn't a glutton for punishment that day and couldn't take another disappointment.  However!!!!!  There is still a shining light among the poorly prepared food and that is the Wait Staff.  I return because they are the best...the absolute best.  Friendly, accurate, efficient, and yes, caring.  They want your experience to be a positive one.  People like Jake, MJ and Sarah are the best that I have had the pleasure to know in a long time.  Why are you caving?  Why aren't you sticking to your original vision?  Now is the time to stick by your guns.  If they don't like the potatoes then keep some boiled spuds on the side for those wimps.",

It was pretty busy today and the service wasn't so great. They have a decent breakfast and lunch menu, they serve both till 3:30. I hear dinner is much pricier. The sandwich I had was fantastic with a lot of great flavors. I added fries (because the sandwich didn't come with anything) and I wished I hadn't because the sandwich was so big I really didn't need anything else. The fries were okay. Would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

But I'm glad I found it thanks to a yelp nearby search after a morning hike.  I walked in and was immediately seated.  I got there a little on the early side for brunch and stayed for about an hour so it was busier when I left.  The menu offers a variety of options.  I went with the egg white omelet that came with a side salad.  My server commented that I was going healthy today but I told her I wasn't done.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  And then went back to healthy with a side of mixed berries.  They have a nice looking coffee and cocktail menu but I just went with water and regular coffee.    The interior is very open and bright, especially on the sunny day I was there.  The tables are cozy so you might want to settle in for a bit.  There was not a long wait for my food and I thought the prices were reasonable even though it felt a bit more upscale.  Highly recommended for brunch.",

Ambiance/Decor: Great, has a classy feel and it felt perfect for a place to kick back and have some great conversations and a relaxing time. Great bar space, but tables with booths as well. There is also a fire pit on the patio that people were sitting at and a cigar bar upstairs (you would have no idea other than the sign because you can't smell it downstairs).  Bar: We took seats at the bar since we were only having some cocktails. I had the Edgewater Old Fashioned which turned out to be really good. I was also happy to see that they are keeping the cocktails classy but almost all are under $10, which is a great find. Our bartender was incredibly attentive and helpful. I did not catch his name but he was a solid bartender even though the bar was full. Also, turned out on a Thursday, they have live jazz and the band was really good. People got up to dance a little too. There are TVs at the bar too if you just want to kick back, enjoy quality service and watch a game.   I did not try any of the food but I am picky about my drinks so for that experience alone, I kept it at a five star because service, cocktail, price point and music were all on point.   I noticed they do have happy hours and I may be back for all you can eat crab legs on a Tuesday night.",

Out last trip for brunch, included several out of  towners and while still eating and drinking and ordering food our server was instructed to give us our checks.  Then the manager came over telling or asking us to pay our checks.    We of course did not and proceeded to be subjected to management actually cursing and pretending to be subtle with their hostility.   ( I could go into actually physical hostility they exhibited, but won't) When paying these prices with tip (20%) already calculated in for us, I don't feel the need to please management's urgency for us to hustle.

The service isn't always great, but the food is amazing! I recommend their avocado toast, the shrimp tacos, the scallops, and their Cabbage and Cauliflower dish. My husband likes their burgers.
