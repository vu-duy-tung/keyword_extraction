This was pretty good but again not outstanding. The crab rangoon was very good, crispy and good flavor. Meals here are a pretty good value for what you get but not a place for a special dinner.  I wish the place was a little cleaner. The tables have greasy and sticky smudges on them and the rug from the door to the counter is down right filthy. When you look over the counter into the kitchen, the kitchen looks clean. All in all, I go there for takeout.",

We always get general tsos, chicken with mixed veggies, fried rice, pork lo mein, beef lo mein, chicken lo mein, or egg rolls, they are all excellent. Change for fried rice with no extra charge. HUGE PORTIONS feed 4-5 people for $20. The pork lo mein has to be our favorite has an excellent smoked pork flavor. Everything looks, smells, and taste very fresh.",

The sauce is sweet and delicious with enough flavor you might want to drink it... Seriously. I haven't yet but if no ones watching next time I order, I may. The hot and sour out is good, it has more black pepper flakes than I'm used to,  it other than that it's very tasty.   Since this place has been discovered a week ago, I've ordered this 3 times.

(Be forewarned that some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area have some suspicious tasting meat in their dishes but Yeung's House is definitely not one of them).  Coming from Hawaii where there is an abundance of great tasting Chinese take-out places, this was the closest thing to home for us.  From the outside, you may dismiss the restaurant as being another hole-in-the-wall establishment but the inside is very clean and well kept.  The best deal is the lunch special which ends around 3:00 p.m.  You get an entree, egg roll, soup and fried rice for a very reasonable price.  Our favorites were General Tso's chicken and beef with broccoli.",

While it wasn't terrible like food court style Chinese, it certainly wasn't great.  Sesame Inn was still better in my opinion, as is Chen's in Cranberry.  That said, it was a good amount of decent food for a small amount of money.  The General Tso Sauce was a little too thick for me, but tasted ok.  The Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good.  Beef Broccoli was overcooked and a little mushy.  Noodles were good, not overcooked like a lot of places.  Decent food for cheap.  But certainly not great.",

    "text": "I got takeout from here for dinner this past Sunday with my girlfriend.  This has actually been my go to takeout Chinese place for a while because the food tastes great, you get a ton of it and it's cheap.  For my dinner entree I ended up ordering one of their lunch specials.  You can do this for $1 more at dinner and it comes with an egg roll and soup of you choice.  So for my entree i ordered an extra spicy general tsaos chicken with hot and sour soup and fried rice.  Their hot and sour soup might be my favorite hot and sour soup in the burgh with a very peppery taste in addition to the normal flavorings.  The egg roll was crispy on the outside and filling although not overly tasty.  My General Tsaos was both sweet and spicy due to my ordering of it and was very pleasant to my palate.  The rice never is anything special but since you already have had a ton of other food, it is tough to finish.  I think that in the end, it cost my girlfriend and I $13 for two lunch specials which both of us struggled to finish.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  The food taste itself is probably only about  four stars but the quantity combined with the price and always courteous customer service makes this a 5 star place to me.",

As far as looks and everything goes, this is just about the same as any other Chinese takeout joint with one glaring difference.  Yeung's is extremely clean and well kept! It was noticeable as soon as I walked in. You can look back into the kitchen and it looks very well kept. They have the familiar picture menu above the register counter and your typical takeout flyer menu. I was greeted by a very friendly woman who spoke to me first. I placed my order and after a short wait, my General Tso's and Shrimp Spring Roll were ready.  The wait was under 10 minutes.  I ordered off of the Chef's Specials which was explained to be larger portions. The General Tso's was only $9.95 and believe me, there was enough there for two meals!  It was delicious and exactly what I was looking forward to.  The convenient location, friendly service, clean atmosphere and food are all reasons why I will be back!  I highly suggest checking out Yeung's House if you live nearby.",

The only issue I ran into with ordering from here is that I had to locate their menu online from Google. They dont have it posted anywhere -so definitely pick up one of their paper menus if you take out. I called in our order and the woman on the phone was very friendly- it was already off to a good start. I called back to make an adjustment to the order and she was super nice about it also, which I appreciated.   I drove to the restaurant to pick up our order and the place was IMMACULATE in its cleanliness. I couldn't believe how clean and organized the restaurant and counter were. Needless to say I was impressed. The parking lot was full when I got there - always a good sign - and my order was ready as soon as I got there! No wait time at all - order was perfect, except for one white rice that was supposed to be a fried rice - nothing I cant overlook as there was no price difference for one or the other. As a take out place it was also nice that there was an area for those who pick up where you can grab your own plastic cutlery, napkins, soy sauce, duck sauce, and hot mustard. This was also really nice as most of the time when ordering Chinese take out, they just throw a couple of sauces in the bag. I liked being able to get everything together myself and pick up what we wanted.   I tried a few different menu options to check out the quality of their basic offerings. We went with egg rolls, General Tso's, Chicken with Broccoli, Kung Pao Chicken, and Vegetable Lo Mein. For all of that- it was only about 28.00 - a super good deal as we ate for half the week! We were not disappointed in one single thing. It was all super hot when I got it home and super delicious. There were huge chunks of real chicken in both the Chicken with Broccoli and Kung Pao Chicken. The General Tso's was also delish and the Lo Mein had tons of whole, fresh veggies in it and was not greasy, as some Lo Mein's can be. All vegetables in all of our dishes were large chunks of real veggies - they were crisp, not wilted or old or non-existent. Probably some of the best take-out I have had in awhile. Needless to say, we will definitely be ordering from here again, and it is now our go-to for Chinese in this area.  If Yeung's House is near you, it is a great option for take out- you won't be disappointed!",
