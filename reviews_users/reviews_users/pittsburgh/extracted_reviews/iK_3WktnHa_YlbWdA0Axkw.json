    "text": "Okay for when you're craving Korean food, and don't want to cook at home.   The restaurant is nice sized, plenty of space to sit and eat. It's not overly decorated with gawdy trinkets, well lit, and more typical of family run places.   If it's your first time looking for Korea Garden it's easy to miss, since you have to navigate the maze of one way narrow streets of Oakland, and be careful where you park, since you can block someone's driveway without even realizing it. It's like the street, some sidewalk, and driveway are all one block of asphalt with no clear markings.  The service is pleasant, and attentive, not smothering. They say a place can be judged by it's panchan offering, but being in Pittsburgh, I'd say the offerings are decent, and they refilled on request. The bulgogi is usually a safe way to get a feel of the place, and it was okay, nothing spectacular, I really miss the open fire cooked bulgogi you can get in larger cities with a larger Korean population. I also had the chajangmyun, noodles with black bean sauce, and while it took care of my craving, it was no where near what I've had in Dallas, L.A., or northern VA. Pricing is reasonable, considering making Korean food at home is time consuming. I do prefer Korea Garden over Sushi Kim, going on taste alone.",

We went here for the first time on a recent Sunday for lunch, and it was bustling with Korean people slurping their soups and noodles, splitting big plates of bossam (steamed pork belly)... mmmm.... I love going into Korean restaurants where the special menu items are written in Korean and hanging on the wall.  We ended up ordered jajangmyun and tangsooyuk -- the Korean riff on Chinese black bean noodles and sweet and sour meat (in this case, beef.) It really hit the spot.   Korean food options are limited in Pittsburgh, but Korea Garden is a place I'd go again and again.",

Anyway, it wasn't thoroughly disappointing, but it was pricey and we didn't even get the full-service banchan that I'm used to =( And I'm sorry if I sound like a jackass, but coming from LA I'm sure this restaurant would go bankrupt if it had to compete against more authentic Korean places.

We have eaten at the best Korean restaurants in Northern New Jersey in the Palisade Park and Fort Lee area and we can both unequivocally say that Korea Garden has food that is comparable to those restaurants.

Other outstanding dishes were the cham pong (spicy seafood noodle soup), soon du bu (soft tofu soup), kim chi jii gae (kimchi stew), bul go gi (marinated beef), ja jang myun (noodles in peking sauce), tang soo yook (sweet and sour beef) and the sweet and sour chicken.

I only come here to get the Bulgogi lunch box special (around $8 plus tax and tip), which is not a bad deal.  It comes with salad, ONE (!) dumpling, rice, kimchi, and a miso soup.  Sometimes, they serve you hot tea for free (if they don't, you should just ask for it and they'll give it to you).  They don't really give you that many side dishes though, which is surprising and disappointing...  The service is not bad, it's usually a cute Korean girl running around to serve everyone.  The restaurant isn't that big, but it's not that small either (like Oiishi).  Parking can be hard to find since Korea Garden is tucked away in the slums of University of Pittsburgh off campus housing, as we affectionately call it, so it'll call for street parking.  I think there is a parking lot, but I haven't seen it yet.  Personally, I think Oiishi Bento has better Korean food :p but Korea Garden is not bad, especially for Pittsburgh.",

The shrimp and scallop bento box was covered in mushrooms (which were not listed on the menu but made up the majority of the dish... not a happy surprise for someone who despises mushrooms.  In fact they were the cheap western mushrooms that seemed only to be there to bulk out the dish.  Nasty.)  The japchae was passable but far from the best I've head.  At least it wasn't greasy but the sauce it was in was not quite what it could have been.  Its on a dirty little street and hard to find and way overpriced.  We won't be going back.",

The wait staff was very attentive and refilled our hot tea often. The food came quickly. We had the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and all the sizzling ingredients were quality and tasty. It was accompanied by a miso soup and five small bowls of assorted pickled and fresh veggies, which we were not expecting because the menu didn't mention them. They were delicious, too!  Now for the few negatives: The ambiance is lacking. The place is not decorated at all,  and the hot tea is served out of ugly plastic pitchers which grow cold too quickly. Parking is difficult because it is in a residential section of the university neighborhood. But these are the only negatives. I will be back because of the delicious food and the kind service.",

I don't think anyone in their right mind should charge $20 on bulgogi without any quality sides like fish or scrambled egg, potatoes or tofu soup combinations...they don't even do that in LA restaurants!! Good food, but they're taking advantage with their pricing. Average cost for two people is about $50 meal, without appetizers or dessert and maybe just ONE beer. The first time I went here, their food was really good. The second time, it got really oily and sparse...and they added too much onions to fulfill the plate. Would go here again, but not as often as I'd like to, or at least til I find another local Korean joint.",

In any event, if you're looking for Korean food, this place isn't bad. Might actually be on the good side even. It's a small quaint little place so you'd probably pass by here and not even know it. Parking around here is almost impossible considering it's on the same street as a bar, beer distributor and a pizza/sub joint.   The food here is par for what Korean food is. Nothing great, nothing bad, but kind of in the middle. Place is a bit pricey for the food in my opinion but definitely a nice change of pace from the usual subs and pizza for lunch. Worth a try at least.",

They had an extensive menu from my recollection and all seemed pretty authentic. You don't see naengmyeon on the menu at places around here typically. Unfortunately...they were out of the dishes we wanted in particular. The soups were pretty good. The soondubu had good flavor and wasn't overpoweringly spicy. The LA style galbi we ordered was decent was well. Overall opinion is that the food is grossly overpriced. Especially for being in a very college environment. The price was not worth the overall experience in my opinion.   Service was less than stellar. The waiter just started, so I give him the benefit of the doubt with not being familiar with the menu, but our order was wrong when it came out. We took it anyway since we've been waiting so long for our food and were running short on time. When we went to pay our bill it took maybe 10 minutes for is to get the check back for signature.",

The interior was very bland- no decor and no Korean tv shows.   Or no decoration.    I was going to put all these aside if they food can overcome these shortcoming.    We ordered LA kalbi, I asked if it was enough for myself and my college age son, since the price was high $26.  He guy said yes, depending how hungry we were.  When it came out, there was so much bone and so little meat that I scoffed, and needed to order more.  There was only four side dishes: not fresh kimchee, kong-na-mul, motion-kimchee, and a fourth that we cannot remember.  They were below average, and not very good nor fresh.    So I ordered Kim cheegigae - that was disappointing too, not very plentiful and the pork pieces had the bone knuckles.    We are visiting from LA or the San Diego area, so my level of expectation is from there.  I guess I can't recommend any place in Pittsburgh for a great sit down Korean style dinner place yet.    The only other place that had high reviews was closed for the holidays.",

The only major difference from Korea is how much meat they pack into the dishes. I was very impressed with how meaty the dumplings (mandu) were.   I have had Korean food in DC, St Louis and Oakland and by far Korea Garden has the boldest, Truest spices. The kimchi is actually spicy and the spicy pork put a fire in my belly (in a good way).   My wife ate kimchi stew and was also very happy.   The server was very friendly and made sure my cup was always full.   Cons: keeping Korea Garden out of the five star rank is the slightly high price range, lack of parking  and the servers lack of English. So speak Korean if you have any special requests.  If you order \"as is\" they understand the numbers and you really can't go wrong.   I would give a 4.5 if possible. Delicious. If you want real Korean food in Pittsburgh, this is a must try.",

My companions ordered stews, one of which was the tofu and seafood stew, also excellent.  The stews arrive at the table vigorously boiling in the bowl, which is a bit off putting, but better than it arriving cold...  It's well worth going to the Pitt ghetto of South Oakland for the experience of eating here.  They have a cooler full of beer.

It's quite salty, much like it is in a restaurant in Seoul for half the price.  The dumpling soup which is a staple of mine was very salty and didn't have much beef flavor.  The dumpling filling had a strange taste.  I've also gotten the cold buckwheat noodles, good but we can make better at home for a quarter the price (one of the cheaper dishes to make in America).

    "text": "Coming from Atlanta, I was shocked by the lack of Korean restaurants here. I am used to the \"Korea Town\" feel of Gwinett County and I have to say that Korea Garden is pretty subpar compared to what you are \"supposed\" to get.   I ordered the \"Seafood\" tofu soup and my friend had the jia jiang mien(spelling?) and the kam poong-gi (\"fried\" chicken dish). The Seafood tofu soup had virtually no seafood other than baby shrimp, but it had an abundance of mushrooms (apparently, the \"other\" seafood). The jia jiang mien tasted like spaghetti mixed in with some bland sauce and the kam poong-gi was disgustingly soggy and sticky, and overloaded with chopped carrots.  Not only was the food terrible, but it is overpriced! I paid $4 more for tofu soup here than what I would in Atlanta, but then again this restaurant has virtually no competitors here compared to Atlanta. Also, there are some poor management decisions here due to possible stinginess? stupidity? only god knows what. Why would ANY manager put only TWO waiters to cater to the entire restaurant on a Saturday night????? The poor waiters were running back and forth, literally, and there were a lot of disgruntled customers. I never even got my drink refilled once, but I cant complain because there were people next to me who didnt get their drinks until AFTER they got their food (which took an extremely long time already). Afterwards, many people sat at their tables waiting for 15-20 minutes for their checks.  If the food doesnt drive people away, the service certainly will. Maybe I just got the worst items on the menu, since there are more positive reviews than negative, but If you must have Korean food,  I guess this is an okay place to go. I would advise you to bring a water bottle if you decide or happen to go on a busy night so you dont choke on your subpar food.",

Very authentic. The spicy pork is amazing and the Bulgogi is pretty great too! Staff if always friendly and food is always made fresh. For all you Kimchi lovers, this Kimchi is as good as it gets. Absolutely phenomenal! The only negative aspect is the parking situation. There is no near street parking so you usually have to park quite a journey away and just walk. But, it's worth it! Five stars, hands down.",

The food is a little bit pricy but less expensive than Green Pepper and more authentic than Oiishi Bento. Although I'm not Korean so I can't really say what's authentic or not, it's always full of Koreans and all my international Korean friends like it. My favorite is the seafood pancake and bibimpap. Love the scorched rice at the bottom.  I've been to the Karaoke rooms once. You can rent out a private room, but it gets pricey. They have a range of both Korean and American songs, mostly mainstream music.",

I highly recommend both the Sun Du Bu and Den Jang Jji Geh. Soooo tasty! They also provide  4 different kimchi accompaniments - cabbage, seaweed, radish and bean spouts.   Korea Garden's menu includes dishes from an assortment of Asian cuisines - Korean (obviously), Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese. Depending on your dish, the prices are reality cheap, especially if you are getting the Bento box for lunch.   This place is fantastic for large groups of around 8-12 people. The food arrives together in a cloud of steam. It's impressive how hot all the dishes are when they arrive at the table for large groups.   Korean Garden is a great little hideaway restaurant in Oakland. The food is authentic, consistently delicious and never disappoints.",

The prices for the bbq seemed a bit high especially for the amount served but the rest at least for me seemed reasonable.  So far, I've been here twice and both times the food has been great but the service as usual a little slower - not because they were unattentive or bad , it's just that there were only two people working upfront as a server, buss er and a host.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's a family-run, authentic Korean restaurant where the experience is in the food--not in the decor. The price of the food is much closer to how much Korean cuisine costs in bigger cities with sizable Korean communities. Unlike Green Pepper in Squirrel Hill, it's not overpriced.  The first time I ordered the Mool Naeng Myeon, which were buckwheat noodles with beef and radishes plus Asian pear slices. It came with a cold salty broth to pour over it. Good ratio of meat to noodles but it was hard to finish as it was a large serving. I got the Bi Bim Bap the second time in a normal bowl, super delicious and full of crunchy veggies. Last night I ordered the Soon Du Bu which is a stew of silken tofu and shrimp, squid pieces, and mushroom. It was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten at a Korean place--the tofu melted in my mouth like butter, and the broth was savory and delicious. It came with a small bowl of rice. The egg was nice and runny, perfect for piercing over the rice.  The Banchan here is pretty standard--musaengchae (Korean radish), kimchi, and kongnamul (bean sprouts). The radish is my favorite! Everything is made in-house, too. It still cracks me up that they give you Wrigley's double mint gum with your check, but, hey, I guess you need it after eating here. I love this place and hope it sticks around for decades!",

    "text": "This is restaurant is undoubtedly understaffed. There were two employees at the front in charge of hosting, waiting, and busing all of the tables as well as managing phone orders. It was obvious they were stressed and continuously in a rush. Having one more employee working the front would make dining here flow significantly smoother. Based on the prices of the entrees, it seems management should be able to afford another server.  The prices for the Korean entrees are high. The menu items under Korean BBQ averaged about $30 per entree. In order to use the stoves at the table you need to order at least two of such entrees. Also, the BBQ portions are limited. In New York, I've seen Korean BBQ buffets for $30 per person, but never this much for just one portion of Bulgogi or Spare Ribs. The Korean non-BBQ dishes average over $20 per entree.  The Japanese and Korean-Chinese dishes were priced com the range of about $7 - $20 with different prices during lunch or dinner for certain items.  I opted for the Ban Jai (steak and shrimp). My only complaint was that the steak was well done; otherwise, the shrimp and mushrooms were good. The Nam Jai is a bento box which also came with fried dumplings, fried rice, crab sticks, kimchi, and cucumber & carrot salad. I thought all of the sides except the crabmeat were very good.  I think Korea Garden has some of the best Asian good on Oakland. I would certainly return for a different bento box!  Oh, and paper towels are located outside the restrooms.",

    "text": "I stopped by Korea Garden with some friends last night, since they were looking for a restaurant in Oakland, and none of us had tried this one before.  Unfortunately, I doubt any of us will return after our experience last night, as there are many better places to eat at in Oakland (and that's saying something, given the mediocrity of the Oakland dining scene), and better Korean restaurants elsewhere in PGH.  Since me and one of my friends had never tried Korean BBQ before, we decided to order the pork belly version to share ($27). The waitress suggested that we get something else to ensure that there was enough food, so we ordered the chicken from the Chinese-Korean section ($16).  Finally, we ordered soju to go with our meal ($12), at the suggestion of my other friend, who's been to S. Korea.  Every one of these items, without exception, was subpar.  The pork belly, normally one of my favorite items to order, was chewy and flavorless, indicating low quality meat and overcooking.  The chicken was something straight out of an Americanized Chinese take-out place, consisting of fried and breaded pieces smothered in a thick, sweet sauce with some vegetables sprinkled in for good measure.  Some of the chicken pieces were almost completely dry, whereas others were gooey from sitting in the sauce, making for an inconsistent and undesirable texture.  The soju was sweetish and watery, despite being straight from the bottle.  The service we received was equally bad. Our waitress didn't stop by our table once after our food arrived.  Our waters remained unfilled, and the banchan that came with the KBBQ weren't replenished, which should be standard, according to my friend who visited S. Korea.  Indeed, we had to ask the person who came to bus our table for the check.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is grossly understaffed--our waitress was the only one working, except for the person bussing tables.  In the words of my friend who's visited S. Korea, we were very unimpressed with the quality of food and service we received at Korea Garden.  To add insult onto injury, the prices are quite inflated--we could have had a solid meal at the hot pot place up the street for equal or less than what I paid for this meal.  If you're in the mood for Asian food in Oakland, I strongly suggest checking out that place (Top Shabu Shabu), or one of the other Chinese restaurants nearby.  If you're in the mood for Korean, try Green Pepper in SqHill or Nakwon Garden in Shadyside.  Regardless of what you're in the mood for or how close you want to stay, I guarantee that you can find a meal with better quality, prices, and service at any number of nearby restaurants.",

It(raw) came out brownish looking, not fresh. They unroll and cut up the meat. But took the bone(with meat still on it) away. We did paid for that, didn't we? 3. Next table was using a sauce bottle. Waiter ask for it back. Because the kitchen needed it.  4. We finished a bow of sauce for the BBQ. We ask the waiter for more. He took our empty bow to the kitchen and return with the same bow just with more sauce in it. Use a clean bow would be a standard procedure. 5. Waiter collected all the soy sauce bottles and refilling it at the corner table and forgot all customers(5-6 table).  6. Multiple people come to our table to cook the BBQ. How can that be cooked correctly? 7. It lack of ventilation. No over head big vent hood like all other BBQ places does. Walk in it is more like an nigh club then a restaurant.  8. Ordered a sea food soup pot($43.00!!). You don't even get a whole crab, just half. And all sea food in it were frozen.  9. Group of 4(three weren't big eater). Ordered 1 sea food soup pot, 2 meats, 1 appetizer and 4 beers. Final bill - $150.00. (Wow! Really?!?) 10. One of us ask for hot tea. Waiter replay: We don't have tea.  This is the 1st(and hope last) time a Asian restaurant I been to where it doesn't have tea.   If you have no taste buds and have extra money that you don't care. By all means, go and eat.

Maybe this is why I feel like my food is much higher quality than others did. I ordered dukbokki and sundubu jjigae (which is my ultimate comfort dish if I'm eating Korean). He waiter is really friendly (is this family-run?).   Service was perfectly fine and he made sure I always had a full glass of water. Food is fresh, it's not top notch (because I was lucky enough to go to Seoul, but it ultimately doesn't matter, plus I live in Philly so restaurants there are great), but I thought it was great and prices are perfectly fine.   People try and find such cheap food/labor for cuisines that aren't as common in the US, so I never try to argue about prices to a reasonable extent. This is great for people who want a lowkey lunch or night, looking for their Korean fix. Then again, I was the only one there at around 2:30 in the afternoon.   Wish they served kimbap, though!",

So, it requires a little more planning if I want something a little different from Chinese or Thai.  I made the drive into Oakland to try out Korea Garden.  I really had a craving for Galbi (beef shortribs) and there isn't a lunch option - just the dinner size.  At $26, it better be good.  And it was.  Plus, it was served with 5 amazing side dishes (Banchan) and I enjoyed them except for the one seaweed one.  The texture wasn't for me but it was still tasty.  The rest I pretty much finished off with the very tender beef shortribs and white rice.  My wife went with the much cheaper Bulgogi lunch box.  It came with a huge bowl of miso soup, fried rice, one fried dumpling and a heaping helping of Kimchi.    The total post tax and pre-tip for lunch was $40.    We came during a pretty busy lunch service and service was very friendly and attentive.  We lucked out on finding a parking space right across the street from the restaurant.  And apparently, there is a parking lot behind the restaurant - you just need to ask for a parking pass when you leave.  All in all, worth the drive and we were both very happy with our lunch choices.  I'll definitely be back to this place.",

    "text": "Korea Garden is by far the most authentic Korean food in Pittsburgh. Let me explain: First, there are two rooms upstairs which you would never know are there, one for big groups and the other for Kareoke. Second, if you don't speak Korean... well... you might not be able to ask questions during lunch if one of the younger waiters isn't there yet. Third, the food is amazing, as it seems to be a mom and pop affair since I've never been there without seeing one of them. Fourth, like all Korean in the Burgh it isn't cheap, but I have only finished my meal once (full disclosure: I eat super slow and get full... I'm probably saddest about this predicament of mine when I stop by KoGa T.T). Although I have an alcoholics prediliction to Sapporo it can be hard for me to justify the steep price of the beer, and unless you know your Korean or Soju, expect to not have any idea what their wine list contains. Lastly, I come here alone whenever I need to avoid running into people I know and get some great food, and with a few exceptions I'm the only white guy there! Expect more Chinese guests than Koreans, I think this has to do with the immense popularity of Korean food and soap dramas in the PRC, but probably just as much with the large section of the menu entitled \"Korean Style Chinese Food\". Regardless of authenticity I wouldn't recommend this place to everyone but if they have some cash and an itch for more types of dolsot than any other Korean place in the city, then you must drag them here at least once!",

It was during Sunday lunch and luckily it wasn't too busy so we got our food quickly and the service was great considering it was just one guy waiting on 4 tables.   My bf got the black bean noodles. He said it was okay. I think the sauce might have been from a frozen pack and not home made. I got the kim chi jigae. It was good. Nice and spicy and hit my kimchi craving. We also got the duk bok gi and that was really yummy.  Overall this place was okay. Not spectacular, but okay. Some of the prices are expensive compared to other places I've eaten. Otherwise, good place to go if you want to have a quick Korean meal.",

It is the same as other korean restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This time I was craving Jjam bong and jja jang myun really bad and they like the only one that I saw serving these dishes. I decided to try and totally disappointed. I recommend to avoid these dishes.  Jja jang myun - pretty much taste like instant Jja jang myun. We believe that they just use the Jja Jang myun instant noodle and served it to us. Their efforts of this dish is like at 0/10. No fresh cucumbers on the top or nothing. $9 for this is a big no no. Jjam bong - very water down and over cooked noodle.  I don't remember the first time I was there whether there were more side dishes or not. This time, they only give us two side dishes, not even yellow pickled radish that normally come with Jja Jang myun.",

I base my restaurant ratings mostly on how easily I think I could replicate the dish I ordered- the flavor profiles aren't super complex, but the cost to get the ingredients and the time commitment definitely make it worth it just to go to this restaurant. Minus one point for inconsistencies with how the bibimbap was prepped and I guess the atmosphere isn't super inviting.",

Korea Garden is hard to miss - but please don't - you won't regret it!  Pretty much every time I've gone I've gotten the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap and on the \"specials\" menu are some dumplings and of course the variety of small plates.  I am a huge dumpling fan.  I've gotten dumplings at many different Asian restaurants - all of which are different.  But there is something about these dumplings.  The sauce, the crunchiness, just everything is SO good!  I highly recommend them.  Bi Bim Bap is best when you get it in the hot bowl - making it the Dol sot bi bim bap.  It warms everything in the bowl when you mix it, but also gives you some crunchy rice.  Get some of the Korean hot sauce (ask for it if they don't provide it).  It (in small amounts for my wimpy self!) just adds the perfect amount of spice to it.  Korea Garden is a must go for some amazing korean food.  Go check it out!",

I ordered the Tapoki and for $9 I really did expect more. It was merely a handful of rice cakes and the fish cakes were under cooked and really chewy. I also ordered the beef bento box that came with fried rice and dumplings and let me tell you, this was not something I would order again. First, everything was leaking and sauce ran all over my carpet. Second, the dumplings were soaked and not fresh at all. The beef itself was quite oily as well. Not sure if the place itself is any better than the ordered food, but I don't feel like I'll be answering this question any time soon. I am sure there are much better Korean places around Pittsburgh.",

Upon entering the restaurant at prime time on Friday night, there was only one table being served, with the other eight or so empty and devoid of life.  \"Weird,\" I thought, \"especially since this restaurant is located so close to where students live!\" Alas, I gave it a try anyway, since I desperately wanted some Korean stew ever since moving to Pittsburgh two months ago.  I got the soondoobu. It's alright. Just, alright. It's quite spicy, but I like my Korean food spicy. The side dishes were... less than ideal. Bland to the point of tasting stale, I did not consume any more past the initial sampling.  So... The food is alright. This restaurant would not survive in New York City's Koreatown, but I was just glad to find some Korean food in Pittsburgh.  Oh, and a note about the service. After I came in, no more customers came in. So, the employees of the restaurant left the front desk and all congregated at the back of the restaurant to chat amongst themselves. There was no service between the time my food got to me and the time I asked for the check. They didn't even bother come over to see if I needed anything, or if the other table needed anything. I was almost anticipating walking to the back of the restaurant to inform them that I would like the check and leave, but goodness the employees left their table gathering just in time.  TL;DR: it's Korean food. Not the best, but satisfies a craving.",

There weren't really any customers there but we sat down anyway. We ordered a squid stir fry, dubboki and bibimbap. The squid stir fry was around $20 some bucks and was actually pretty good. However the portion sizing is way too small compared to its price, especially with the dubboki. The plate of dubboki looked like a layer was barely placed over it to cover the plate and the side dishes were a bit sad to look at. Overall, it's quite overpriced but the food quality isn't bad.",
