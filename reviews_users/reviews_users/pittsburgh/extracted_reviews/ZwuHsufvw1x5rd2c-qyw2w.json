The bar staff are fabulous and victuals are to die for and food delicious! One of our wings fell during playing and they let us know and brought it out shortly after. We tried a little bit of everything and it exceeded our expectations! Seating has options as well with a more bar atmosphere in front and an option for quieter restaurant feel in the back. Perfect for date night, happy hour, big groups, and everything between. We will be back very soon.",

    "text": "I used to walk by on my way to market square and watch the construction progress. I've been wanting to go to this restaurant before I even knew its name. I am so happy that this place exceeded my expectations. Now there are a lot of restaurants in Pittsburgh and a good portion of them are gimmicky and trendy and lacking in the quality food. Pirata is not one of them! I ordered the Jamaican Beef Patty empanada and the Mahi Mahi tacos. My friend ordered Arrachada tacos (Skirt steak). Everything was outstanding, fresh and flavorful. My fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the steak was surprisingly tender and juicy. Their house made hot sauce is spicy and sweet but a perfect addition. I'm typically not a fan of hot sauces but I drizzled that mix on everything. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The bar is large and we watched as the bartender squeezed all fresh juices for the mixed drinks. The art is breathtaking and just fun look at. They have massive murals of sea creatures and ships. I'm already planning my return trip for both cocktails and a visit with my family. This is a must try new restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

We hope you stay open for many more years to come.  I did take photos of the food. Some dishes do not look in photos, especially with the lighting. Over all, very good food. Prices were right.

    "text": "J and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner today after seeing a play. I am always skeptical about Caribbean food, as my family is Caribbean and I have high expectations. I'll start with the Pros: the decor was very pretty. Nice murals, bar top, and stools. We sat at the bar to watch the Steeler's game while we ate our food and spoke to the bartender who was very friendly. The prices for the food were fairly decent. I got the Caribbean crab cakes to start and the sea bassa sandwich with tomatoes, spicy mayo, arugula, and spicy ketchup. J ordered the jerk chicken and subbed the rice and beans for fries. Everything was around $40. Now the cons: despite the food sounding tasty, it actually wasn't. There was a major emphasis on spicy that it masked the flavor of everything we ate. I couldn't tell you what my fish tasted like, and J described his jerk chicken as \"spicy sawdust\". Plus, my fish sandwich was way too messy, which made the experience poor overall. Another con was the smell. There was the smell of fried fish wafting around the bar/dining area, which was very unpleasant and difficult to ignore. We figured dessert couldn't be that bad, so we ordered two orders of the rum bread pudding. Unfortunately they were all out...at 4pm? When we walked in, another couple was leaving. We were the only people in there for the duration of our meal, which lasted about an hour. Needless to say, we do not plan on returning.",

The bar tender was very helpful and friendly, suggested the Cuban sandwich. I should have taken his suggestion and kept it simple. I went with the Arroz con Pollo which was disappointing. Visually the dish looked great but the rice was overcooked and sticky. It had an overpowering taste of olives which should be an accent to the dish. The  chicken was a mix or dark and light meat which wasn't very flavorful. At one point I bit into the meat only to find it was a piece of fat, needless to say I was a bit disappointed that I spend $20 on a dish that lacked an authentic flavors. I would still go back but I would limit my visits to tropical drinks.",

    "text": "I expected excellent food based on other reviews but was unfortunately not impressed. A lot of our food lacked flavor or was dry. The sangria was spicy which was unexpected. The guacamole, however, was excellent. What really bothered me about this restaurant was the extremely lacking service. Our server questioned one of our orders by saying \"that's all for you?\" Not the best way to suggest this may be a lot of food. The guacamole came with about ten plantain chips, not enough for the quantity of guacamole. We asked for more, were given about ten, and were charged THREE dollars in addition to the base charge for the guacamole.",

I also tried an empanada which was great. Drinks were also good, and exotic.   The second time I had tacos. The flavors were good but the taco was extremely soggy. I could barely pick up the tortilla because it was soaked in juices of whatever was in it/salsa. The people I was with felt their food was average, but loved the coconut collard greens.   Overall: pretty good food, attentive service, and cool decorations/vibe.",

    "text": "How refreshing! Finally a diverse restaurant with a wonderful variety of foods that challenges my palate with familiar, cultural flavors and new flavors that are enticing!!! So tired of the bland palate of the usual pittsburgh restaurants and so nice to not have the usual fried 'everything' & being offered fries on everything. We had the wings with a yummy Guava barbecue sauce, tostones with a garlic sauce, sliders, and Trinidad cod saltfish fritters. The wings were perfect! Tender, juicy and the Guava subtly came through the barbecue to really enhance the flavor. The sliders were good. The tostones took me back home!!! They were DELICIOUS! The garlic sauce was a nice addition, but I would have preferred a cream garlic sauce ( just a personal choice). The selfish cod fritters were good. A little salty, but so tender and so fried perfectly. Both the wings and the fritters were accompanied by a dip, that wasn't explained in the menu. A sort of cucumber/avocado dip with a little kick to it. That was ok, but not really good. The service was beautiful from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. The waitress knew the menu, and was able to guide our choices and I appreciated that. We will definitely return to try more menu choices...they're so many!",

    "text": "My wife and I met in Market Square to grab some lunch.  We decided to go to one of the burrito places and as we were walking to it, we ran into one of her friends.  He had just come from Pirata and suggested we go there.  What the heck, why not try something new?  So we headed off to Pirata.  The first thing I'll say is that our bill was $38.  For 2 people.  For 3 menu items.  That's expensive for lunch.  The second thing I'll say is that it was worth every penny.  It was probably the best meal I've had in a while.  We only got three things but each one was delicious, perfectly plated and in just the right portions.  One big plus is that they bring you a bottle of COLD water and leave it at the table.  I drink a lot of water so I was especially thankful for this.   We started off with the smoked pineapple guacamole.  Quite possibly the best guac I've ever had.  The smoked pineapple is a great addition to the guac, giving it the perfect hint of sweetness.  It was plated with some large leaves in the guac (maybe from a pineapple?) and more than enough fried plantain and malanga chips that were presented wrapped up with a bow.    For our meals we got the tacos which included 2 tacos each that were delivered on a cutting board or random piece of wood.  I got the jerk chicken and she got the mahi mahi.  The jerk sauce was super spicy but not overly spicy and also super delicious.  It was complemented well with a sweet mango chutney and a refreshing cucumber raiata.  Her mahi was breaded and cooked to perfection and topped with pickled red cabbage and jalapenos.  We didn't say a word for about 3 minutes and then our tacos were gone.  It all happened so fast.     The other great thing about the place was the music which, when we were there, was a remix of 80s tunes (mostly Michael Jackson) into reggae.  I liked it.",

    "text": "First, I must say that I really wanted to enjoy this place. The ambiance is great and it's pretty (except for the large mural on the wall... seems a bit kiddy).  The bar is beautiful, seating is comfortable, and they have many drink options... One of the guys working there even helped me to my seat (chivarly isn't dead!). We sat at a table near the bar.   My friends and I came here since we had a reservation at another nearby restaurant.  We were here specifically for drinks, and we had 30 minutes for a drink and walk to the other restaurant. Our server was SUPER nice and friendly and walked us through their drink menu... I asked if there was a typo on the drink menu because of a $400 rum/cocktail flight called \"Millionaire\".  Who gets this flight??? Anyways, I digress....  Since we only had 30 minutes we told our server of our reservations we had, and ordered our drinks immediately - we were 2 couples, a group of 4.  My girlfriend and I had two rum flights because we figured it has to be one of the easiest drinks to prepare - pour 3 \"shots\" in a nice glass and keep it moving.  Next, the husbands order some sort of dark liquor cocktails. I know my husband ordered a manhattan because he's as predictable as they come.  I can't remember what my friend's husband ordered, but it was some cocktail.   10 minutes later we wave down our server like \"Hey, did you put in our drink order?\" She's like \"Yeah let me see what's up.\" She never returned to give us an update.  10 minutes later we wave down our server like \"Hey, Ummmmmmm..... Drinks?\" She didn't return to give us an update.  5 minutes later... 25 minutes since we placed the order... The guys get their cocktails, and I inquired about the rum flights that weren't in hand.  She had no response, and instead we reminded her of our reservation. So to run things along we also had to ask for the check before we even got our rum flights... So we got our check, paid for our drinks before we even received our rum flights... Did they forget about us? Was the bar busy? We were watching the bar since we had 30 minutes of time to waste and they just seemed to be in \"chill mode\" as if they were actually on a Caribbean island. If we would've known it would have taken over 30 minutes to get 4 drinks I would've never come.  So, we were late to our other reservations.... I was extremely sad. I cannot speak to the food, but the drinks took entirely too long to get to us.  It will likely be a while until I come back to try any of the food.",

    "text": "Kind of stumbled upon Pirata's while searching for a place to eat after watching a Saturday matinee at the Benedum.  I noticed a Yelp friend was checked in here and saw that it is a Caribbean restaurant which piqued my interest.  I quickly glanced over a picture of the menu someone had posted on Yelp and decided to give it a go.    I found the restaurant aesthetically pleasing with cool Caribbean colors and decor.  We decided to sit at the bar.  It was early about 4 PM so the place was a little empty being there between lunch and dinner.  Our bartender/waitress was warm and welcoming.  She got us started with a couple of drinks and I inquired about their fish tacos or Pescado and how they were cooked as I don't like fried food.  She confirmed they were deep fried.  I asked if they could be grilled or broiled instead.  She mentions she can ask the kitchen.  When she makes it back to us she announced that they can grill them instead.  Great!  Ordered two grilled Pescado taco plates, and two empanadas one Jamaican Beef Patty and one Pollo Fricassee.  While we waited I checked out the rest of their menu and there was some interesting sounding dishes that I would definitely want to come back and try.  Some time goes by and our food comes out.  All of it at the same time.  This isn't a huge deal but it would have been nice to have the empanadas first as an appetizer but we didn't clarify that we wanted it that way so no biggie.  I looked down at my taco's and thought these look fried, a very light fry but fried.  I poked them with my finger to see how they felt when the manager (assuming he was) came up behind us and asked if we ordered the grilled fish tacos.  We said yes and he grabbed both plates and apologized saying they were fried and he would have a fresh set up briefly.  I was happy he jumped right in and made the situation right without me having to flag anyone down.  Also gave us time to enjoy our empanadas.  They came with a red relish, but it was lacking some flavor.  I think a little heat, fresh cilantro and some citrus would have helped that relish a lot.  The empanadas were good but not sure I would order them again.  The dough to meat ratio seemed off, but nevertheless enjoyable.    After some time the manager approaches us and apologized saying the kitchen made our tacos again but not to his liking so he had them redo the redo.  He said we will take care of the tacos and again was very apologetic.  I was completely fine, especially since he was really being a customer service rock star.  He went on to tell us that they have only been open for two weekends and have some kinks to work out.  A little time later our tacos make another appearance in front of us.  The taco's looked great and came with a nice vinegar Caribbean slaw, a corn salsa, and a slice of lime.  I was preparing my tacos for lift off to my mouth and on first bite I noticed they were still raw and cold in the center.  I mention it to my husband who seems to think I should just eat them the way they are when I say they aren't just undercooked they are cold.  I bring it to the bartender's attention and she apologized and asked if there was anything else on the menu they could bring me.  I told her I really want the tacos and am fine waiting on a re-fire.  In the interim, Matt shared his plate with me so we could both eat.  His were cooked right and tasted great.  The fourth and last plate of tacos came out a short while later and I am happy to report that they were cooked wonderfully and I was a happy customer.  They did forget to bring the salsa with this plate but I quickly asked and was taken care of.    On our way to leave the bartender was pretty down on the establishment and made a comment to the tune of I hope we did something right tonight.  I told her we'd definitely be back.  Even though there were some hiccups the manager and server/bartender took care of them right away and in the end it was a lovely meal in an appealing atmosphere.  I hope they iron out their kinks soon and are a huge success.",

    "text": "This place rocks! My wonderful husband took me here for my birthday and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The restaurant is located just off Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is lovely and well-lit with a big bar in the middle and plenty of space for both hanging out with a drink and sitdown dining. It was pretty crowded when we were there and the space and music really created a fun vibe.   Our server appeared promptly and was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They have a big drink list with many, many different kinds of rum, rum flights (!), cocktails and wine. My husband ordered a rum flight. Tip: apparently the 1 oz and 2 oz flights cost the same. The flight was 3 two-ounce tumblers of rum and according to my husband all were excellent. My pregnant self really wanted a \"cocktail\" and they were kind enough to make me a virgin pina colada which was delicious.   We started with appetizers and ordered the Jamaican mac and cheese pie, the pollo fricasee empanada and the pineapple guacamole. The mac and cheese pie was stellar. Please order it. I also really enjoyed the empanada - I was expecting the shell to be crispier, but it was still good. The guacamole came with fried plantain and yucca chips which I loved. The guacamole itself was freshly made (it comes with sprouts on top, btw) but there was an overpowering smoky flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of. Not sure if it had bacon or something. The appetizer plates are pretty small for the price.   Next we ordered entrees. I had the black bean soup with a side of tostones and my husband had the jerk chicken. The soup had a good flavor, but it was just too salty for me. However, the tostones were DELICIOUS. Tostones are double-fried plantains that are usually eaten like French fries. These were much bigger than the ones I'm used to and came with a garlic topping. They were served with a spicy, creamy aji pepper dipping sauce. Different than I've usually seen them served, but they were perfectly crunchy and well seasoned and the sauce was a great complement. I do wish they'd come with some ketchup too, though. My husband loved the jerk chicken - it comes over rice and greens.   Finally, we ordered tres leches cake for dessert. I absolutely love tres leches and this one was outstanding. It came topped with a meringue cream and cherries which I personally could've done without because the cake itself was so delicious. It was light and airy and moist and sweet and amazing as tres leches should be. The piece was HUGE so definitely recommend sharing.   Overall - this place was great! As others have said, it is a little pricey but great for a special occasion. Highly recommend checking it out.",

I was really curious about this place and our waitress introduced the place as \"Pittsburgh's first Caribbean restaurant.\" I don't believe this statement is entirely accurate, but maybe she meant downtown Pittsburgh?  The rum menu was very extensive while the food menu seemed limited in comparison. But wow, the food was so flavorful and everything was prepared really well! My favorite? The empanadas, which were buttery, filling was not at all dry, and loaded with great flavor. They were served with sauces (appeared to be a type of red salsa for one and a spicy mayonnaise for another), which I didn't even think was necessary.   As with many new restaurants, Pirata could benefit from a little more time to work out all the kinks. The speed of the service during this visit was extremely slow. We were there for an hour and still did not receive our food; we had to, unfortunately, ask them to box up our food to go. However, since we waited so long, the manager made it up to us by offering a gift card to give them a second chance. How nice was that??  Trust me, we did not complain as we understood the learning curve new restaurants must go through so this offer was too generous.   Despite having a long wait, the delicious food will blow you away and help you forget that you waited so long for it.",

I tried the Zombie flight and each one was delicious, and deceptively strong. It was $18, but considering each drink of was a solid 1-2 shots and were a perfect blend of subtle fruitiness, I think overall it's a good deal, especially to share. I wasn't a fan of the strawberry daiquiri personally, but they are usually too sweet for me. The food was good, an mix of Cuban, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, Jamaican, etc. I recommend the empanadas ($2 each), especially the chicken and the Jamaican patty. For the entrees, I tried the Ropa Vieja and the fish tacos (2 tacos). Both were solid dishes with fresh ingredients, but semi-pricey as is expected with the area ($23, $15 respectively).   The staff was very attentive and did a great job for being such a new restaurant. Atmosphere was great, liked the reggae music. Also had TVs to watch the pens game. I will definitely return to try more appetizers and cocktails, and the desserts!",

    "text": "This place is cool, no doubt.   I am a rum connoisseur and any place that has the name Pirat in it is a must see for me. I went here to have drinks with a friend and I won't lie, the vibe and atmosphere are great.  I pulled my signature, \"Would you be able to make me a caiparinha\" trick and...to be honest, not bad. Could've held off on the soda water but hey it's all good.   I didn't eat the food because to me this place is reflected better by its cocktails. Very good selection of drinks.  Didn't really get a Caribbean vibe. It looks more like a fancy restaurant you would find at  a Bahamas resort. But that's okay, it keeps in tune with the other establishments in the area. When I think tropical vibe I think Hidden Harborn in Squirrel Hill..now that place looks tropical as all hell.   AWESOME rum selection. When my buddy from Trinidad is in town we will come back for sure.   Overall, not a bad addition to Market Square. A good place to just meet up with friends, have some decent cocktails before going downtown or off to Perle to mingle with the cast of Desperate Housewives.",

All the rum lovers must check this place. The appetizers were really good, especially the empanadas. The entree tacos were a hit and miss. My husband ordered jerk chicken and i ordered the jerk shrimp. Both of us loved the jerk shrimp. Its something coming from my husband who is not too fond of shrimp. But the jerk chicken eas disappointing. It did not go well with the raita dip it was served with. I wish it had a little more kick. The portion sizes was enough for me but my husband was still hungry when we left the place.",

The decor is fun and then cozy once they turned the lights low. The bar was hopping and the restaurant was over half full. People were really enjoying their drinks and there dining experience.  I was tempted by the empanadas but ordered the Cuban Steak.  It was one of the priciest items on the menu. It had beans and rice as a side. My hubby ordered a chicken and rice meal. I kept checking out everyone's Caribbean cocktails. I also kept looking at the decor. My youngest son is fascinated with Pirates and it made me think of him. When my Steak came it looked great. It had a lot of onions on top. I'm not a huge fan of onions but my husband loves them so he ate most of them. The flavor of the steak was very bright. They had marinated it with lime and spices. Lime or any citrus usually breaks down the toughness of meat. The Steak was big but very thin. It was too chewy. . . almost tough. It also had some spots that seemed like gristle that I couldn't eat. The citrus had not broken down the fibers of the Steak. The Steak was delicious but I could only eat about half. The beans were good but could have used some seasoning. I liked my meal but didnt love it. What I loved was my hubby's chicken and rice dish. In fact we both loved it.  Needless to say that our meal had highs and lows. So we're going back for a second try. This time I'm ordering the empanadas and a fun Caribbean drink to start and go from there.",

My friend had the Cuban sandwich and it came with fries and some delicious Jamaican ? ketchup - the manager saw I loved it and brought me some to take home! It is honestly so delicious!!

Empanas were delicious, arroz con pollo authentic and full of flavor, the tacos de pescado were un believable.  All in all, we will be coming to try more different Caribbean options off the menu for future tastings. The atmosphere definitely takes you away from the feeling like you are in Pennsylvania and you feel like you are in the Caribbean. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up and superb wait staff.",

They bring out two sauces with all the food they were good but super hot! Wish they offered more mild options. Anyways we had shared the jerk chicken 24$ the sandia y honey 12$ and the beef empanadas 4$ everything was delicious! The greens were really good and rice and beans were average but were meant to be mixed with the jerk chicken! We shared the jerk chicken plate and it was plenty of food! The empanadas were awesome and I wanted to order like 20 more lol! The sandia y honey had a lot of flavors was fresh and sweet, the one thing I didn't like was the pickled watermelon rine was too tart for me! Overall it was good but was pretty expensive :( I would eat here more if it was more affordable for a 60$ check with a shared plate of food was crazy and the one ginger ale I had was 3.00.....over all a lot of my rating is due to ambiance and great flavors.....but it comes at a cost!",

Amazingly it never got so loud I had to tell across the table!!!    But enough about the great space. The food is absolutely delicious. I got the pork belly sliders. They are $12 for 2 so a little pricey but certainly not your basic street food. They were exceptional and on home made tortilla! The yucca fries are battered so this was unusual but not at all unwelcome! My dining companion got the Cuban  She finished it without chance of offering. It come with a HUGE mountain of fries and pineapple catchup. A bold move for a Pittsburgh restaurant.   The rum cocktails are both good. The mojito royale is as expected and right.

    "text": "I was really excited to go to Pirata because I adore everything about Caribbean food, especially the fact that it is super vegetarian/pescetarian friendly. When we got there, our waiter asked us if we had any questions about the menu, and I asked for clarification that the \"sofrito\" part of the Madura Hash and Eggs dish was just a sort of sauce and not a meat component. The waiter then asked if I was vegan or vegetarian, and I said that I was a pescetarian. He then told me he was vegan for 7 years and proceeded to recommend the jackfruit tacos as a good option for me, but I had my eyes between the has and the arepas. He cleared up that the hash DID NOT HAVE MEAT, so I went with the hash because it had everything I loved- plantains, black beans, and sweet potatoes.   So when the hash finally came out, I was in heaven. It looked so good, and it was a very generous portion. When I started to eat it, it definitely tasted a little off. Eventually, I found what appeared to be a piece of pork fat in my dish when I realized- the whole dish tasted a bit like bacon. I then pieced together that the dish must've been cooked in some sort of pork fat or bacon grease or lard. When the waiter came back, I asked him if it was cooked in any of those and he said no. I then showed him the pork fat piece and he asked for it so he could show it to the kitchen. He came back and said that the chef said it was A PLANTAIN. Let me tell you folks, I am very familiar with the texture and appearance of plantains, especially because there were countless plantains in my dish that I could compare it to. This was- and I can say this with almost complete certainty- a piece of pork fat.  I then asked the waiter what the dish was cooked in then. He responded that he didn't know (which, why was this not something he asked the chef when my original question to him was WAS THIS COOKED WITH PORK FAT), so I responded saying, \"Well usually dishes like this are cooked in butter or oil\" and he goes, as if I had just handed him a \"get out of jail free\" card, \"Oh yes, it's definitely cooked with butter and oils.\" He then says, \"If you come back, I'd really recommend you get the jackfruit tacos, they're the only dish we can really guarantee will be vegan. With everything going on in the kitchen it's hard,\" as if this was my problem because I didn't order the vegan dish which was the only dish they can guarantee to be meat free. Listen, there's a problem if you can't guarantee that your vegetarian dishes are meat-free, because not all vegetarians want to eat vegan. And even though I love vegan food, I did not want the jackfruit tacos. I wanted to eat the (seemingly) vegetarian dishes, and I should have been able to do that no problem. So in response, I told him that I was in fact vegan for 2 and a half years, and have been pescetarian 2 years after that, and I have eaten out countless of times. I explained that when I go to a restaurant, ESPECIALLY one where the waiter knows I don't eat meat products, they clarify whenever a seemingly vegetarian dish is cooked with a meat component.   My experience at Pirata was really unfortunate because the food was actually good. If you have no problem with your food being cooked in pork lard, then the hash was really delicious. But unfortunately, as my body is very much so not used to eating meat or meat products, I did get a tad sick afterwards. The experience made me really appreciate good restaurants and good waiters where they are attentive to dietary needs, and it would've made a world of difference if the waiter was just honest with me and didn't make it seem like it was my fault for ordering that dish in the first place when I could've gotten the jackfruit tacos and then there would've been no problem at all.",

    "text": "Wow! Pittsburgh has something special coming over the next few years as pirata continues to develop and introduce new cuisine to the downtown Everyman.  Brand new to the scene, Pirata presents downtown Pittsburgh with an option unlike any other seen before in the area; Beachy cocktails, daiquiris, and mixed drinks made with True Jamaican rums.  I have visited several times - I was here the night they opened and have visited once every week since-  Literally each time there,  I have seen improvements to the already delicious menu. I've had the Ropa vieja twice, every other time I have ordered the steak tacos - the Vieja takes the traditional \"spared rags\" dish and transforms it into a delicacy. I believe the reason it is so tasty is because the kitchen stays True to the traditional ingredients and recipe which has never been seen before in Pittsburgh; I highly recommend this place for a date, or a night out with the family.",

The sweet plaintains and beef patty are the two items that lovers of the Jamaican or Cuban variety of food will not be disappointed in. The sweet plaintains are delicious and True to form, the beef patty is softer and less flaky than what you could purchase on the streets of Jamaica. For entrees, the Arroz con Pollo was pretty tasty, and pretty spicy but not great, overall. The croquettes too lack much to be desired. However, if you make it to dessert (or even start with it), the bread pudding with fresh whipped cream is to die for!! You could have it with a glass of any rum known to man and the service you'd receive the entire time would be flawless. Staff is friendly, helpful and genuinely cares about the customer experience. The location is also just far enough away from Market Square to provide good opportunity to actually get parking which is always a huge bonus downtown. Put Pirata on your list.",

I had the Jennys tea cup. It was super sweet but really really good. Refreshing and pretty, Came with an edible flower. For starters we got the adobo wings with their jerk seasoning and a Jamaican beef patty. The wings were stellar! We loved them. They were crispy and i don't know if it was the jerk rub but it has almost a bacony flavor. Wings + bacon flavor = table covered in drool. The Jamaican beef patty was surprisingly pretty amazing but it was so small for the price. For entrees we spilt two dishes. The pork belly tacos and the cubano sandwich. The pork belly tacos were a love hate relationship. The actual pork belly meat was outstanding but they put this sweet potato purree on the tortilla and made it super soggy. We just ate the meat out of it. The cubano was great. Overpriced (considering real Cuban sandwiches go for $5-7 anywhere else) Loved it, Pittsburgh was in need of a good cuban. I subbed French fries for Yuca fries and it was a great choice. All in all I can't really complain. Atmosphere was cool and relaxing and food. I wanna go back and explore the menu some more!",

    "text": "ARGHHH!  I feel like that's the most appropriate way to begin my review of Pirata. I've been wanting to try this place since it opened approximately 6 weeks ago. Unfortunately, after reading some of the prior reviews, I wanted to give the restaurant some time to work out the opening kinks before I went. Since opening, the Executive Chef has already been replaced, which I was told was a good thing, but not a strong start. So Pirata is a new Caribbean-themed Rum-Bar and Restaurant a stone's throw from Market Square on Forbes, and is co-owned and operated by the proprietor of Il Pizziaolo (Mt. Lebo, Warrendale, and Market Square) and Bob Wolfinger (formerly of Bravo! and Latitude 40). I used to work for Bob, and I know that when a man spends over 10K a week on CHEESE for his restaurants, my expectation for Pirata was high. Sadly, I was underwhelmed.   First let me say that if you try to make a reservation online, you will not be able to, because the software they use on their website isn't designated for the Pittsburgh market yet, so you must call in order to do so. I made a reservation for 7 on a Saturday night at 8PM. The fact that I was able to do so somewhat made me nervous, as newer restaurants tend to not have such open availability, but having saw the menu and newer reviews, we kept our reservation.  Our party was seated promptly, but that's perhaps the only thing that went well. I'm willing to forgo bad service for excellent food, but that just wasn't the case. Having worked in the restaurant industry for many years, I tend to be a bit more critical than the average person, however some things are inexcusable when it comes to service, and sadly we didn't have the best experience. Once our party completely arrived, we were greeted by our server, a 40-something woman who seemed quite friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a plethora of different drinks from the cocktail menu, hoping to feel as if we were on a Bahamas vacation, sipping Daquari's and Pina Coladas. I ordered the frozen banana concoction and my friend ordered a Pina Colada. Honestly, even seated right next to the bar, it took 15 minutes to get our drinks. With 3 bartenders working, this seemed somewhat unacceptable. Making matters worse, we watched the frozen drinks sit at the service bar for 10 minutes, only to melt before our very eyes before the server was able to bring them to the table. Then, upon delivering my drink, the server doesn't know which drink is the banana beverage and which is the pina colada, so she LITERALLY puts the drink up to her nostrils to smell it. I've never seen anything so bizzare in my life. It was really disgusting, and then after she wasn't able to determine which drink it was, she placed it in front of my friend, claiming it was the Pina Colada. It wasn't. So, we signal over the server to alert her of the situation. She then goes to the bartender, returns to tell us that what she made us was indeed a Pina Colada. I'm not one to argue, but I know the difference between Banana and Coconut/Pineapple. Rather than challenging the intelligence of the guest, just remake the drink properly without question. So she agreed to. 15 MINUTES LATER, she stops to pass by the table to alert me that \"I need to go get some Pineapple\". So the bar doesn't have Pineapple. This strikes me as odd. A bar serving Pina Colada's doesn't have Pineapple. So basically, you knowingly gave the wrong drink to the table because you knew you ran out of an item and failed to tell the guests. 10 minutes later, \"So I have some bad news, we're out of Pineapple\". So my friend orders a Strawberry Daquari. 10 MORE min. pass, and a MGR. brings over another drink but guess what! It's the banana drink! So the olution to rectify the problem was to give my friend a random drink he didn't order? What if he didn't like Banana (not the point, but still). Amazingly, 5 minutes later, the Strawberry Daquiri shows up. Do the math. It took an hour to get one drink right. Also, I asked for a Rum Punch (or something similar, since they have over 200 Rums). Server replied, \"Lots of people have been asking but we don't have a Rum Punch\". Strange. Guess what the 2nd item on the late-night drink menu? Rum Punch.....  I will say the apps were INCREDIBLE. I highly recommend the Spicy Tuna Tacos and the Jamaican Beef Patties. Very authentic and fresh ingredients. At this point, I'm willing to forgive the lack of service because the food was that good. The entrees were excellent as well, as the Cuban sandwich was a hit. I did hear them say they ran out of rice at one point, which seems odd.   I feel that if we possibly had a different server, our experience would have been different. But for a semi casual restaurant dinner with 7 friends to take 3 hours seems ridiculous. I will return this Summer, but for now 3 STARS.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that this place is actually very good - I haven't had a bad drink or dish, the service is good, the overall ambiance is very nice.   After several trips here, though, I just can't give it 5 stars because of the value factor.   Now, I realize that value isn't really what they are going for here, but I do feel like a restaurant should strive to be in the ballpark of a balance between price and product offered.   Their food is elevated - so I expect to pay more and don't mind doing it.   What I do mind is feeling like everything on their menu is 10-15% higher than it should be for what it is.     For example, let's examine the smoked pineapple guacamole appetizer.   It's absolutely delicious and beautifully presented, but it's unbalanced and they know it.  There are 8 chips.  Eight.  The chips are special - not your standard corn tortilla, but still...   They actually tell you there aren't enough chips when you order it and recommend that you get 2 orders if you are trying to share.   Not sure how that solves the balance problem exactly, but I can't bring myself to spend $24 on two scoops of guac and 16 chips.  It's special, but not THAT special.  With a few exceptions, much of their food offerings fall into this category.  Cocktails and wine are also pretty pricey.  Not insanely overpriced, but generally a buck of two above what they should be for what they are.    The other thing is that they added gratuity (20%) for our party of 6.  Although I have been a server and understand this practice to some degree, I also am offended by it as a customer.  Tips are earned, not assumed.  I tip based on the service provided and frequently tip more than 20%.  This server actually did a very good job, so she actually shorted herself in the end by assuming that I wouldn't tip appropriately.     So in the end, I guess the moral of the story is that if you want a good meal with a twist of something special, this is the place....but expect to pay for it.",

The rice was mushy, which is not the consistency carribean rice and beans have.

    "text": "So in love with this place. We decided to skip our dinner reservations and just turn our late lunch into a multi hour excursion once we sat down here. We had a couple pitchers of the Bruja to drink, and split the smoked pineapple guacamole, the pollo frito sandwich with sides of tostones and plantains, and the tres leches cake to wrap it up. Everything was so good!! The smoked pineapple guac came with two kinds of chips, the pollo frito sandwich was super good although less jerk flavored than we thought it would be. The coleslaw on top had golden raisins and pepitas, which I was not expecting but wasn't mad at all. We may have ordered a second order of the plantains because they were so good. We didn't finish the watermelon mojito popsicle because it was just eh (the liquor separated from the ice), but everything else was fantastic.   The atmosphere was great, really cool interior design, and our waitress was good! She wasn't sure what some things were on the menu, but she went out of her way to find out and we felt she was attentive; the bartender was the only questionable person here. We watched him hit on a woman who was there with her husband and brag about his sex life. It was uncomfortable to watch; and really, anyone could've made these drinks. Aside from him though, the staff were all great, and we will definitely be back next time we're in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "I am a tough grader and this is my favorite bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh! Why? Simple:   1. They have over 200 different kinds of rum. You can get Don Q from Puerto Rico, Brugal from the Dominican Republic, Abuelo from Panama . . . . . and those are just some of my favorites . . . .  2. The Caribbean food is absolutely awesome. I've taken a lot of people there, both for business and pleasure. We've never had something we didn't like. Not a single item! Some of my favorite items are tostones, black bean soup, all the empanadas, and the frita sliders. But feel free to order anything you like on the menu, you'll love it.   SECRET MENU ITEM -- If you go on a day when they are not going crazy, ask them to make you an \"El Jibarito\" sandwich. As of this writing, they have not put this on the menu; although they are considering making it a standard menu item.

    "text": "Found this place walking through pittsburgh looking for brunch with Vegan options. Upon finding out that we were vegan, the chef and staff offered to let us try an experimental option he had been thinking of rolling out to the main menu: A smoked jackfruit taco with pickled strawberries in a beet corn shell. I really enjoyed it: a very unique combination of sharp and spicy flavors I certainly haven't had else where. My only two critiques are:   1. I wish the jackfruit was more meat-like in texture. Because it was smoked, and not seared, it had a nice smokey flavor but was still soft like fruit. 2. More savory flavors. The combination of strawberries and house made mango habenaro salsa made this taco unusually sweet, almost dessert like.   We also had a vegetable empanada with house made pesto sauce and some fried plantains. The empanada was perfectly fried, and the pesto sauce accompanied it well. I like stronger flavors in general, and so I did note that the empanada was a bit flat. Fried plantains were sweet and light. Overall both were delicious with great texture.   Staff was friendly and personal. Would definitely recommend. Will come again.",

    "text": "So, I had wanted to try this cool Carribbean concept restaurant for quite some time now, and the opportunity came up to enjoy it with my brother on a guys' night out with the Joe Bonamassa concert last week. We read the menu and some of the reviews, and were really excited for our experience. It's conveniently located by the PPG plaza on Forbes, and there's lots to do around that area.  Reservations were a snap - they have a link on their website, and it's super easy. The front of the house staff were very friendly when I texted them (while stuck at a standstill in dahntahn traffic - there was a Pens game, after all) and said it was no problem, and thanks for letting us know.  I was greeted with a warm smile and pleasant, courteous service by the hostess when I arrived, and she showed me my table in the back room, where Cutthroat Island was playing on a big screen TV. The music in the room was a bit on the loud side, but that seems to be popular these days in many newer restaurants, so I didn't mention it. Soon enough, the manager came in and lowered the decibels, much to our happiness.  So, initially service seemed good, and our server came in and did a good job taking orders for drinks and appetizers, always being patient and friendly. I don't know if he was just new or what, but he had a hard time when we asked him what his favorite things were - he basically would recite the whole menu. No big deal, we just like it when the wait staff will give us the real low-down on things like this, without trying to over-sell a dish.  This place is more of a bar that happens to also sell food, so keep that in mind if you are going to visit. It was hopping at the bar. I loved my drink, which was well-balanced and delicious. My brother's was too. Beer choices are good too.  Now, on to the food... The appetizers were OK - especially the cod fritters. The tuna soft tacos were just OK, but not spicy at all (they are advertised as spicy...) - somewhat bland. I would probably add in a little Carribbean flavor, because they were pretty bland. We ordered a Cuban sandwich and the fried whole Snapper. Big mistake. First, it took an eon for our food to arrive. We were done with our appetizers for 15-20 minutes before the main deal arrived. I understand that the kitchen can get backed up, but we just sat there, and nobody asked us if we wanted another drink or if they could check on things - it was nice to talk to my brother and all, but we were hungry!  The Cuban sandwich should be avoided at all costs. I've enjoyed many down in Miami, so I think I have an idea of what a good one tastes like - this was not it. Actually, it was essentially flavorless and tough. The sliced pork loin had absolutely not one molecule of umami. I'm not sure I would have been able to tell what it was if I were having it in a blind taste test. The ham in the sandwich wasn't far behind. The cheese (gruyere) tasted like brick cheese and not a tangy, flavorful gruyere. In fact, the only thing I could really taste were the pickles - too bad this wasn't a pickle sandwich. I didn't like the bread much, and there was a lot of it. We make lots of panini at home, and this bread was just horribly dense - I think all the air had been pressed out of it in the panini press.  The fried whole snapper tasted like a steamed fish, and it didn't have much flavor at that. While I love steamed fish, I prefer seasoned steamed fish much better - this just didn't have ANY seasoning that was discernible. The consistency was great, so I think it's a simple fix - might be cool to have a sauce on the side to give the fish a little help, because it was bland, sort of like the fish my grandparents had to eat on a cardiac-healthy diet.  Now the real disappointment were the tostones - I typically like them a lot. These, not so much. They came out pretty cold and overly solid - these were not the sweet, tangy warm tostones I have come to love elsewhere. I don't know if they just sat on the line too long or what. I wouldn't brave them again. The yucca isn't much better.  I will say that the Executive Chef came out to check on us in the back (interestingly, he only came to our table, not the other three that were seated) right as we got started - I wonder if he was worried about what had been served. It's hard to change once you've started, though. Folks in the kitchen in many places don't much care for diners who send their food back.  All of these things said, I think the place is trying hard. I bet it would be a home run if they would shrink the menu just a little bit and perhaps focus on a Caribbean \"tapas\" concept, since the bar is so popular - this would give folks the opportunity to try lots of little dishes that would be able to be served hot and fresh while they enjoy the incredible drink menu. I just think that the current concept may be extraordinarily challenging to execute. I'll give it some more time - maybe we'll try again in a few months...",

I visited on a Monday night, the restaurant wasn't very busy, so I sat at the bar to take advantage of Happy Hour!  The bartender approached me right away, and was super friendly throughout my entire visit.  I ordered a sangria, smoked pineapple salsa (happy hour portion, yay!), a chicken empanada and the Cuban sandwich with fries.  The sangria was EXCELLENT, the real deal, not just wine with fruit.  The pineapple salsa and empanada were also very tasty.  The salsa was fresh, smoky and sweet, definitely different from anything that I had before.  The empanada,was flaky and flavorful.  The star of the show was the Cuban sandwich, layers of ham, pork, swiss cheese, on real Cuban bread....yum.  The sandwich was huge, I only ate half, and saved the rest for lunch the next day, and it was even better!.  This was a great meal, can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Looking for something to do late on a weeknight? Late night specials 10-12!! It was a Tuesday night and I saw this restaurant pop up and always wanted to try, so my husband and I went in at 10pm. There was only one other person sitting at the bar, but given time, the whole bar was filled.   Our bartender/server was very attentive. She gave food recommendations on their late night menu and so we tried a couple items. Out of our sampling, I'd recommend these 3:  Ham & Cheese Croquettes- 4.5/5 cheesy, crumbly/crusty melt in your mouth. There were 3 small ones per serving with a garlic aioli sauce. Steak(Arrachera) Taco- 4.8/5 steak was cooked perfectly, there was crumbly blue cheese inside a corn tortilla with a few jalapenos for a kick. Mahi Mahi Taco- 4.9/5 plantain crusted so very crispy and sweet which balanced out the fish, chipotle mayo, and cabbage. Wonderful flavor balance.  The drinks were good, but I enjoyed the food the most. The decorations inside are also fantastic, like being on a boat. There was a wood ceiling over the bar, seascape murals on the wall, a quartz-like bar top, and comfy velvet chairs. Portions are pretty small on the late night menu, so you'd have to order a few if you're starving but overall great experience and it's nice seeing new & different restaurants pop up downtown.",

It was dark inside and very few restaurants are open downtown on Sundays, so I almost walked past.  Once inside the decor was great.  The rum selection was very impressive and I started with their version of an old fashioned.  It was great and the banana and walnut flavor wasn't overly powerful.  On the menu, The East Indian crab cakes caught my eye so that's what I ordered.  They were plated nicely and the the portion was huge.  It came with greens on top and a mango salsa.  The greens were okay, loads of steams.  The mango salsa was outstanding. Probably the best fruit based salsa I've ever had.  The crab cakes were very mushy and the star of the show wasn't present.  While I could see the crab, I couldn't taste it. Hopefully I'm wrong but it tasted like canned crab. Which is not worth $28 price tag.  It wasn't the worst crab cake I've ever had, but its no were near the best.  Very middle of the road.  Overall I really liked the place and I do plan on returning. Hopefully the crab cakes were a dud and the next dish will blow me away.",

Ron Molinaro, who owns Il Pizzaiolo and Pizzuvio, also owns Pirata. I love both Il Pizzaiolo and Pizzuvio so I couldn't wait to give Pirata a try.   The first thing that I was drawn to was the smoked pineapple guacamole for an appetizer. I love plantain chips and love pineapple and guacamole, but the $12 price for an appetizer seemed a bit much. I was set on getting the smoked jackfruit tacos, until I was told they didn't have that anymore. They also didn't have the Jamaican curried goat tacos. There is nothing more disappointing than being told the menu item you want cannot be made. My second option was the skirt steak tacos($15). The tacos are topped with garlic mojo, arugula, watermelon radish sofritto, and salsa de arbol. You get two tacos which I thought were generously layered with tiny bits of steak. The steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The garlic mojo has a bit of a kick to it, but pairing it with the watermelon radish sofritto brought a nice mix of sweet and spicy. My friend ordered the burger and fries and really raved about it. I did try some of her fries and they were the perfect tiny crunchy kind. I would like to come back to Pirata and give their empanadas a try!",

    "text": "Amazing first experience at Pirata! I stopped in for a quick lunch and I was not disappointed with a single thing we ordered off the menu. We started with the malangas fritters for our appetizer - so delicious! You get four fried malanga balls that are paired with a garlic aioli dipping sauce. Deep fried then covered in more fat - nothing sounds more delicious yet fatal than that. For my entree, I went with the kale & arugula salad which comes in a very good portion size. The burnt honey vinaigrette was delicious yet light. It is topped with pickled watermelon (a little weird), pumpkin seeds, and goat cheese. My only complaint would be the pumpkin seeds which were way too tough to even bite. I had to hand pick them out of my salad before I choked on one of them. We also ordered the papas fritas and sweet plantains for sides. They also come in very generous portion sizes. The fries came with Jamaican ketchup which, dare I say, I actually liked more than the regular ketchup (I'm sorry all you Heinz lovers). For the end of the meal, the sweet plantains served as a nice (healthy-ish) dessert alternative.  Service was good throughout the entire meal. Everyone was very friendly and since the restaurant was slow during our visit, service was prompt and all our food came out quickly. Highly recommend Pirata for anyone looking to test out some unique cuisine downtown!",

    "text": "I was thrilled to get out of the cold while visiting the holiday market. I was greeted very warmly and given a choice to sit wherever I wanted.  Pirata is a Caribbean themed restaurant and bar. I inquired about their fish offerings and the fish sandwich I was hoping for they were out of. My waiter did suggest that if I wasn't overly hungry that I could opt for their fish tacos. He said they come two to a plate and are very small. They also offer salads and soups. Sides are extra unless you order a sandwich platter.  I decided to go with the fried chicken breast sandwich with fries and Caribbean slaw. He told me that the normally put the coleslaw on the sandwich but at my request they would put it on the side.  The place was fairly empty so I got my food in record time. The chicken was juicy and tender and of course was bigger than the bun. The slaw was also very good. The fries are of the shoestring variety. It is served with a cup of ketchup. I couldn't figure out why each time I ate some of the fries they were hot and peppery. Later I learned it was the Caribbean ketchup they serve which adds a lot of pepper to make it. This was the only thing my waiter forgot to tell me. So heads up. It was fairly dark where I was sitting and easy to mistake it for regular ketchup.  Yes, you can ask for regular ketchup. This restaurant and bar is a welcome addition to our city and is located a little more than a block past Market Square. I was very intrigued with the mural they had on the wall and the manager said she will contact the painter in Florida and send me a picture of the full mural. Looking forward to returning here on a future visit downtown.",

Walked in here on a Saturday night with out of town visitors (had tried initially to go somewhere else, but there was a crazy wait) - and frankly this ended up being significantly better than my original plan.   I ordered vegetarian empanadas and a vegetarian curry - both were amazing.  You get one empanada in an order and it was a great appetizer.  The curry was very generous and delicious!  If you like hot sauce (that has a kick), make sure to get the mango habanero sauce - a little bit goes a long way.   I'm definitely putting this on the list of places to revisit. The service was great and like I said - the atmosphere was a lot of fun!",

I would have like to give it 4 1/2 stars, but I can't figure out how to do that:) Our waiter Alex was very nice, personable & honest in his recommendations (\"not necessary to get a protein on the the fruit salad\").  This is not a \"hoidy-toidy \" place--just fresh, Caribbean-Inspired dishes.  We had the Guac Trio, with fresh Plantain chips---awesome! My dining partner and I had the Grouper Taco and the Ropa  V Taco -both wonderful. We split the Tres Leches dessert which was very good. Not too sweet.  They have a short wine list, but decent. I had a House Red-fine.  They have an impressive rum & tequila menu, though we did not sample it. We did though have a Slane Whiskey sip--try it! I'm not a whiskey person, but it's excessively smooth. We had it out of curiosity, having an unopened bottle at home from vacation that included Slane Castle & distillery in Ireland. In short, try this place--good food at a fair price & friendly people--clean restrooms!",

    "text": "We dropped in after work on Friday night to grab a small bite and have a drink before heading over to the Holiday Marketplace in Market Square.  We stumbled on Pirata and decided to walk their plank.  I'll try not to work in too many pirate references but it will be hard.    The scurvy dog serving up tasty cocktails was not real friendly but I think they were pretty slammed before we arrived so maybe he was just worn out or perhaps incurred a serious keel hauling earlier.  The drinks he made for us were really delicious.  I tried the Man O War which is straight rum with some other booze over a huge ice cube so it's stronnnnnng like Cap'n Black's breath after three months at sea. Argh!  My mate tried Meg's Peg Leg which was vodka, cuke flavoring, sage and thai spices which left her adrift.    We tried the pollo (that's chicken for ye English landlubbers) fricassee empanada with a spicy red sauce on the side that was quite delicious and the lechon pork and corn tacos which were not as successful.  In both tacos, there was a very large (bigger than a grape) hunk of pure pork fat.  It was really not good.  The pork itself was very bland and the corn and other taco toppings were no help in the taste department.  I pointed out the huge hunks of fat to the bartender when he stopped by to collect our plates and he just shrugged and said, \"oh.\"  No apologies.  No questions.  It was a little off-putting as far as responses go when you bring something to a restaurant's attention.   They have only been open five weeks so let's hope their Quartermaster picks up their game in the food department.  Their drinks can float my armada any day.",

    "text": "After watching a show at the Benedum my wife and I were hungry and needed to find a place to eat.  We had some restaurants in mind but my wife found this place on Yelp and we decided to try it out.  She said it was a newer restaurant but we didn't know how new it was until we got here.  We knew Pirata was located in Market Square but it took us a few minutes to finally find it.  Luckily we had our treasure map!  (That was a joke for the comedy).  Anyways we walk in and it's not too busy but the restaurant looks great.  It was an unusually warm fall day in the Burgh so they had it all opened up in the restaurant.  You could tell it was new and it looked nice and modern.  So we walked right up to the bar.  The bar was a good size and you could see the televisions really well too.  It's a good set up.  The bartender greeted us and we dove into the food and drink menu.  We were hungry so we knew we wanted some kind of appetizer before our main dish.  The empanadas intrigued us.  They had three to choose from.  The Jamaican beef patty, pollo pricasse, and the beef picadillo.  We ordered the Jamaican beef and the Pollo one.  They were $3 each and we both shared them.  They were good and the salsa type dish that came with it was good to dip in.  We probably would have liked it spicier but it was still good.  I preferred the pollo the most.  I could have eaten a few more of those!  Looking around you can tell that this was a new restaurant.  They were having a little trouble with their background music and getting it right.  The bartender wasn't too sure about some things on the menu.  The owner/GM/Manager was all around making sure things were good.  It just felt like they haven't been doing this for too long.  Nothing bad about that but you could just tell.  We decided to order their fish tacos.  My wife didn't want the fish fried so she asked the bartender if they could grill them.  The bartender didn't know if they could but she was nice about it and said that she would ask the kitchen.  She came back and said that they could grill the fish for her fish tacos.  I decided to do the same thing.    I didn't mention this before but when our empanadas came out our fish tacos came out at the same time.  I really don't like when the appetizer and your main dish come out together.  The head guy there that was walking around walked past us and asked us if we had asked for the fish to be grilled. We said yes because we couldn't tell by looking at it if it was fried or not.  He said it was fried and he will get us new tacos.  I was fine with that because it gave us a little more time to enjoy our appetizer.  He was really nice about it too.  He didn't let us find out for ourselves.  He was proactive and that's what made a big difference this night.  He came back about 5 minutes later with no tacos.  He apologized and said that they will take care of the tacos for us because they are being delayed.  What had happened is they grilled the fish but it wasn't to the satisfactory of the boss so he sent it back.  I love that!  They knew that we were waiting for our order so they probably rushed it and it wasn't right.  A lot of places would have just sent it to us and had us send it back and we would be very unsatisfied.  Again he was proactive and took matters into his own hands.  Great job my man!  It sort of reminds me of Gordon Ramsay's kitchen on TV.  He probably smashed that fish with his fist when it came out poorly!  A few minutes later the fish finally came out and it looked really good.  I started eating my fish and it tasted great.  My wife bit into her fish and it was actually cold in the middle.  It was a little raw which was disappointing.  She sent it back and they started another order for her.  We shared my tacos so she didn't have to wait.  Then about 5 minutes later her tacos came out again and they were cooked all of the way through this time.  We ate those together and they tasted really good as well.  Since we weren't paying for them we weren't upset.  They were upfront that they were new and working out some kinks.  We found out that they had only been open for 2 weekends.  So we understand what was happening here and they gave us great service.  This is going to be a very good new restaurant in Market Square.  The atmosphere was really nice, the food was really good, and the staff made no excuses for their mistakes other than they were new.  They admitted to them and made up for it.  We will be back to give them another chance here at Pirata!",

It was pretty good, but not super flavorful. I also ordered the Jamaican beef patty and a puerro (leek) and queso fritto empanada. My other friends also ordered the Jamaican beef patty with some other items. For all of us, the beef patty was the star of the show. The crust was flaky and the filling was delicious! I gave Pirata three stars for a couple reasons. First, nothing that I tried (my own order or things that my friends ordered) truly blew me out of the water. Also, our waitress was really nice, but kind of pushy. She came around constantly and removed plates from our table, that she thought we were finished with. There were a few times where we had a few more bites of food on the plate and she just removed them without asking if we were finished first. I got the feeling you get when a place is about to close and the employees are trying to quickly clean up... only we had about three hours before the place was closing for the night. I think next time, I will stick to the drinks at Pirata.",

    "text": "I hate to be the first one to give this place a not so great review but it has to be done. I've been passing this place for a few months now waiting and waiting for it to open. As soon as I found out it was I made plans to go the next chance I had. Sadly it didn't live up to my excitement.   The restaurant itself has its niche down. All of the decor fits together perfectly and it's beautiful. The prices and the food on the other hand, not so great. My friend and I ordered one of each of the 3 empanadas to share. The chicken one was by far the best. The beef patty had a weird taste that neither of us really cared for. The other beef one was ok but nothing impressive. All of them were paired with what tasted like a roasted tomato salsa. I have to say it was relatively tasteless.   As my entree I got the Lechon tacos which are pork tacos topped with some peppers and corn. Sadly they weren't that great either. They were missing something that would give them more flavor. What I really didn't care for was the fact my tacos were dripping oil all over my plate and hands. They should probably use a little less going forward. I also ordered a side of their spicy macaroni pie (macaroni and cheese). I thought it was ok but my friend did not care for it because it tasted like it had nutmeg in it.  We ordered a few drinks as part of our meal as well. The Jenny's tea cup and the dirty banana were both delicious. I would highly recommend. My only real problem is the price of the drinks. Or the price of everything rather. If I'm going to pay quite a bit for a meal it should be because it's large portions or because it's phenomenal food. Neither of which are True for pirata. I wasn't overly impressed with anything and I left with no leftovers. Which is saying a lot for me because I don't eat a lot. Overall I think the experience was just ok.",

Both were delish and flavorful and i want more of them now.  We also got the wings, Jamaican corn and Mac n cheese.  All were great, Mac n cheese was probably the star of the three.  The corn was different and tasty.  The wings were good, by nothing special.  I did really like the herby dip that went with them.   The vibe was cool, the bartenders were great and loved the Caribbean music.  I will definitely be back!",

Made me feel like I was on a Caribbean cruise except more sophisticated.   Our waiter was nice and pretty attentive. It was empty-ish for a Friday night (albeit it was 7pm and sooo cold that night). I really appreciated the easy online reservations and the text reminders. The ability to text if I was running late was another really great added bonus.  We got the Jamaican beef patties - they were delicious. Lots of cumin flavor which reminds me of Indian food. In fact, the menu has a lot of Indian influences like rotis and chutneys.   We shared the Cubano sandwich and a side of rice and beans. Of note, you can't sub out the fries on the Cubano which is a bummer. The rice was delicious though :)",

    "text": "The place is neat and clean, the servers are friendly and attentive, and you feel welcome from the moment the elegant hostess meets you, to the exhaustive and informed explanation by your waitress (serving personnel is almost exclusively women, but that's neither here nor there). The menu is relatively short, but oh so hard to pick from. The appetizers are a wonderful selection (varying from pineapple guac to simple fried plantains to delicious looking fritters), matched by the simple but tasty empanadas.  We skipped the sandwiches and focused on the tacos, each of which was very original (including our choices, open blue mai mai and the pork one), and they even have a weekly special one, and we rounded them off with a spicy Mac and cheese which was a well balanced fusion of American and Jamaican. Our friends ventured into the entree section and were rewarded by a crunchy, zesty jerky chicken, served with rice and beans and plantains. The dish was large and the chicken perfectly tender. I'm usually not a fan of rum, but the passion fruit concoction my wife got was heaven in a glass. I can't vouch for their signature Dirty Banana, since I loath coffee, but the others, who tried it, testify on its behalf. The only two issues were the music (general summer hits played a tad too loud) and the price (good for the value but not cheap on a simple scale). Would definitely go back.",

I'm the exact type of person Pirata caters to: I love spicy food, I love rum, and I love PIRATES (True Story- I have 3 pirate costumes at home right now). Quite possibly, I've been waiting for a pirate-themed restaurant my entire life.  I went with a friend. We decided to share everything so we could get the full flavor spectrum at Pirata. We started with drinks. She got the Jenny's Tea Cup, I got the Dirty Banana. The Dirty Banana was delicious, like a milkshake that has a dark past. The Tea Cup was too sweet for me...  I was going to order the Jerk Chicken, but my friend beat me to it. I ordered their take on the Cuban sandwich. We both decided we liked the other's dish better! The Jerk Chicken and accompaniment of rice was a tad too spicy for her, but I thought that dish was A+. I liked the Cuban sandwich too, but it was more or less a run-of-the-mill Cuban... I would love it if it had a bit more pizzazz. Maybe a different type of sauce? The mustard on it didn't do it justice.  The waitress was nice, although she did make herself scarce.  My only real complaint... Well, it could use more pirate decorations!",

Hubby got the mojito (a little sweet) and I had some kind of cucumber spicy margarita (a little too green).  Both were pricey at $12 a piece - next time I'll probably go for a rum flight.    The food was so reasonably priced and so good! We got a bunch of little plates so we could try a bit of everything which was perfect.  Chicken adobo wings (awesome smokey with a great light creamy dipping sauce), papas bravas - crispy potatoes - wasn't expecting the spicy sauce all over them but was still good.  Ordered all 3 kinds of the empanadas which were tasty and so cheap ($2 bucks apiece). And also got the beans and rice (very flavorful).   They also give you your choice of flat or fizzy water for free!   It was Friday night.and they had a dj that came in around 11 playing super fun music - will totally be back.    The only bummer was the waitress, who was super nice and friendly, took forever to stop back so we could get our check to leave - other than that it was great.",

    "text": "I was here for a friend's birthday party. It was on a Thursday evening and there was no wait time. Service was good. The person who waited on us was very patient and friendly.  We ordered a variety of items ranging from appetizers to dessert. We were group of 6 people. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, 2 plates of yuca frita, 1 regular chips, 1 jerk chicken taco, 4 chicken empanadas, 1 adobo chicken wings with dry jerk seasoning. Yuca frita are taro root chips served with a ranch flavored dipping sauce. They also have pineapple salsa and mango salsa on the table that you can use as a dip for yuca frita. The fritas are not oily yet they were crispy to some extent. We all liked it.  Regular chips are typical french fries that you find at any other restaurant. My favorite is the adobo chicken wings with dry jerk seasoning. My first bite was salty, but I liked the taste after the second bite once my palette got used to the flavor. I will order these crispy well cooked wings again when I go there next time. We all liked the chicken empanadas, specially with the tamarind dipping on the side. It is sour and sweet flavored with a bright red color and rough texture. Chicken empanadas are well cooked with a crispy outer layer. Final item in the appetizers is the jerk chicken taco that was well seasoned.   For entree, we ordered three dishes: house special lamb which tasted like a well braised lamb with some curry flavor served over a bed a rice, fried sweet plantains, and a wedge of lime. A drizzle of lime on the tender goat meat hits the ball out of the park. Along with that, we ordered house special Salmon which is panseared and served over sweet potato puree, edible flower and guava flavored sauce on the side. I didn't taste the guava flavored sauce since salmon is well cooked and delicious with a crispy outer skin. The sweet potato puree is the best with subtle flavor.   The only disappointment was the third entree they served which is traiditional Spanish dish (chicken paella) that was mushy and seemed over cooked. We asked them for clarification about the dish quality and they were totally cool about it. Infact, they acknowledged that it is not supposed to be overcooked and deducted the amount from our final bill. This is a nice gesture.   Finally for dessert, we ordered tres leches which is delicious and ended the dinner on a great note. It is soft cake that is served with some milk and has an amazing taste.",

This is my type of bar.  I'd been wanting to try Pirata for a while and finally had a chance to duck in for a drink. The bartender, Carlo, was friendly, answered my questions about the cocktails and offered to make me something else when I asked about other drinks with cardamom. The concoction he came up with was really good! It was fun watching the bartenders make the drinks and the food looked good too. The bar was a nice clean, open area and there's actually a big dining area in the back too. Can't wait to come back to try the food and more drinks.",

They are vegetarian friendly too, which was a bonus (try the bbq jackfruit tacos...AMAZING)! Some of the drinks have nuts, so if you have allergies like me, be aware of this.

I had a delightful happy hour here speaking with bar manager Elena who educated me on the various regions and style of rum distilling. One new fave was a Jamaican rum from distiller Smith & Cross... navy strength. Yes sir!!!  Bartender Matt kept me supplied with delicious happy hour food and specials and introduced me to a rather delicious Venezuelan rum.  I sampled happy hour sized smoky pineapple guacamole with plantain chips - WOW seriously one of the best guacs I've ever had. And I've lived in San Diego and New Mexico which is the bar for me for access to great fresh guacamole. Totally unexpected find in Pittsburgh.  Another awesome aspect of Pirata is the pirate-themed movies that play on the TV with captions and the volume down so you can enjoy conversation but have a good laugh watching Goonies or Pirates of the Caribbean.  Total fan!!! Will return for sure because now I know of a rum based bar and restaurant that delivers on rum and rations.",

    "text": "We really don't have a plethora of upscale Caribbean restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Most of the local Caribbean restaurants are small neighborhood joints that may be long on flavor but short on decor.  The folks behind Pirata obviously spent some loot on the decor of this restaurant and didn't go kitschy either.(Which would have been very easy to do.)  Additionally, their version of Caribbean isn't tied to one particular country's cuisine.  They have empanadas, as well as conch fritters and adobo chicken wings.  I must also say that the service was extremely welcoming and polite.  The manager on duty seemed to be genuinely interested in feedback on the menu, service, decor, etc.. which was much appreciated.   I met my frequent lunch buddies at the restaurant and on my first visit there, me and one of my lunch buddies ordered the Fried Snapper Sandwich.  My other lunch buddy ordered the Cubano sandwich.  Both sandwiches were served with fries and restaurant-made ketchup. (The ketchup was a very nice touch and different enough to make me notice the difference between their ketchup and our locally produced one.)  The snapper sandwich had a good clean flavor and was accompanied by a Caribbean coleslaw.  Yummy!  And I had to try my buddy's Cubano sandwich, which was also tasty.  My only complaint was that the snapper sandwich was served on an average sesame seed bun.  With so much care given to the menu and fresh ingredients, the bun wasn't worthy of the snapper.  Other than that one complaint, this restaurant deserves to go into my rotation of favorite lunch spots.  I have to try the empanadas the next time I go back to see how theirs stands up next to mine. (I make some mean empanadas!)",

I had the fried fish of the day (red snapper) and I've never had a better piece of fried fish. The portion was extremely generous, and the coating was light yet full of flavor. The husband had the grouper, which we both agree wasn't quite as good as mine, but still wonderful. Bar service was quick which was good, and our waitress was very knowledgeable and efficient.

    "text": "We met a couple of friends on a Friday night to try Pirata, as we love Cuban and other Caribbean food, and honestly there just isn't much of that in Pittsburgh.  They do take reservations, though I had a difficult time on their reservation app (I called and they were happy to put a reservation in for me).  The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere captures the Caribbean theme while still somehow being classy.  My only complaint was that when they brought the food, they said the wrong name for the dish, and when we said we didn't order that, are they sure it wasn't the croquettes, both food runners looked mortified that they had no clue whether or not they were saying the right names to match the proper dishes.  It's a small menu, so there's not much reason for not being aware of the dishes you put out, but it's a new restaurant and it got sorted out, so I can excuse that.   First, it's a rum bar, and the cocktails are amazing.  I'm a bourbon/whiskey drinker myself, and typically find rum drinks to rely too much on sweetness, but they balanced the rum perfectly in these cocktails.  I would warn, however, that they are strong.  I can usually drink Manhattans and Old-fashioneds all night, but after two of the cocktails here, I was out.  The food was really good.  It wasn't the best I've ever had in my travels in terms of Cuban food, but I want to be relative here.  It's a lot easier to find a great place in NYC when you have a slew to choose from.  For Pittsburgh, this was more than enough to satisfy my craving.  The shrimp and polenta was creamy flavorful without being spicy, and it was a substantial portion size for the price.  The ropa vieja, a favorite of ours, was also a hit at the table.  The croquettes weren't that appealing to me (they just taste like \"fried\" to me, if that makes sense), and the cuban sandwich bite appetizers were good, but simple and small for the hefty price tag.  These critiques aside, all four of us left the restaurant with a positive impression, and all of us are eager to go back.",

The place had only been open for a couple weeks and everything we ordered was perfect.  I am from south Florida and have had a very hard time finding good Latin/Caribbean cuisine. This place was on point and the flan was the best I had ever had. Today I found out that there is a new chef and a new menu.  Not impressed.  First the waitress told us that there was no bourbon or whiskey sold here (wrong). Then I found out that the amazing chips were no longer on the menu!  Nothing tastes the same, poor presentation and my Cuban sandwich was cut into strips!   The flan was atrocious.  Last month it was a thing of beauty and was almost like eating a creme brulee . Very sad, I was hoping this could have been a great go to place but unfortunately probably won't be. Get that chef back!",

The bar area is very nicely set up. Got there and everyone from the hostess to the server were super nice. Ordered a few things: Patatas Bravas, tostones, a chicken and beef empanada and we both got the churassco tacos. The patatas braves were tasty and had a little buffalo taste to them, the empanadas had a thin tapa and the meat and chicken were both delicious. The tostones were also great, with a good amount of salt. My girlfriend really liked the aioli sauce that came with the tostones and empanadas. The tacos were delicious as well, the way they pickle their vegetables was awesome. We got all this for quite a reasonable price as well, about $20 each. Definitely recommend to go try it.",

After being greeted by 3 different servers who ALL explained the menu to us (that was a little much) we waited 25 min for our actual server to take our order. Our entrees and app all came at the same time and we got a heirloom tomato and avocado salad (which was delicious) halfway through our meal. We also waited a while for the server to get our checks back to us. Not even a busy night. Couple other tables, but not crowded at all. Maybe it was an off night, idk. Ok, Let me get to the food, it was great! We loved everything! Pineapple guacamole was sooooo good! I had the pernil asado tacos, wonderful. My friends had the skirt steak with beans and rice and the fish fry, respectively. They both loved their dishes as well. Over all we really liked this place. Even the decor was very nice and attention was paid to details. I would have given a five star review was it not for the service. Hopefully they will fix that one important detail.",

The drinks score big points on presentation, taste and alcohol content. I ordered a hibiscus cocktail with pineapple juice and pisco (Peruvian brandy), and it was fabulous! My table decided it was everyone's favorite drink, and all cocktails can be ordered by the pitcher. Their mojito is made with champagne instead of club soda/sparkling water. It was also delicious. I want to come back for happy hour because the drinks and apps are the highlight here. Our server told us the GM is a botanist, and she loves creating new, interesting cocktails.   For my main dish, I went with the traditional jerk chicken tacos and the leek empanadas. The tacos lacked some flavor and were on the bland side, but I noticed friends at our table struggling with the spice of their flank steak tacos, downing their drinks and watering from their eyes and noses in discomfort, so given that scenario, I probably made a better choice. The empanada was soft, yet crispy and packed with flavor.",

For drinks, we had a Bruja ($12) and a Jenny's Tea Cup (~$14). Drinks were decorated very nicely with flowers and skull cups, etc. The Bruja was my favorite - much better than Jenny's Tea Cup.  We ordered the Coconut Shrimp ($14) as an appetizer. Its kind of pricey for an appetizer but I do highly recommend. The appetizer includes 4 large shrimp served on top of a mango chutney and topped with green curry sauce. I could do without the green curry sauce but that mango chutney was delicious!  For dinner, we ordered the Fried Fish Sandwich (~$16) and Jerk Chicken ($24). I repeat $24 for jerk chicken and it was not worth it. The jerk chicken just was not jerk-y in any way. It was prepared fried and then baked so it was crispy but did not have much flavor. The Fried Fish sandwich on the other hand was wonderful. The fish was Red Snapper and it tasted so fresh and well prepared. The sandwich also included radish and papaya salad which provided great flavor. I substituted the side of fried for Bahamian Mac & Cheese which was fine. It was spicy but nothing to write home about.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal. Pirata is a nice restaurant for a Caribbean dinner, however it is on the pricier side.",

The tv's weren't on, music wasn't playing, and the place was fairly empty. I'm not sure if it's usually that quiet but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  We started off with the pineapple guacamole. OMG so good. The chips were really different. They don't provide a lot of chips so we ended up putting the rest of the guacamole on our sandwiches. I ordered the fish of the day sandwich and my hubby had the sandwich with jerk chicken and a veggie empanada. Both come with fries but I asked to substitute a side salad. The salad was mouth watering. Nothing that I had expected. Literally the BEST side salad in my life. It had different colored tomatoes, goat cheese, chickpeas just to name a few things in it. I would love that as my entree.  Their drink menu was quite extensive and went with the pirate theme. Im not a liquor drinker but loved that there were so many choices.  Pirata is pricier so I wouldn't come here everyday but would definitely come back on a special occasion.  Service was great and it didn't take long to get our food.",

This is such a cool little place with a neat concept. How many Caribbean style restaurants do we have in Pittsburgh? Definitely something unique and different to try. One friend ordered the pineapple guacamole as an appetizer and it was served with plantain chips. It was very fresh and tasty, and I feel like plantain chips are a healthier alternative to corn chips! Myself and another friend both ordered the skirt steak tacos and they were delicious! You get 2 tacos per order. Highly recommend! We also split a side of fries. It was a huge order! One order is plenty for the whole table to share. My only regret Is that I wish one of us would have ordered a different kind of taco so we could swap one and try one of each! If you're going in a group, I would suggest everyone order something different and then do some trading! They have 2 different hot sauces. One is pineapple something and the other is mango something. They look and sound fruity, but they were HOT. like really hot. And I love hot hot sauce! A sprinkle is all you need... Lastly, my fourth friend ordered the salmon salad that was on special and it looked incredible! I've never seen a more colorful salad! The salmon itself was a tad bland, but the house dressing made up for it! She also ordered a side of Mac n cheese and let me have a bite. I was a fan!  Pirata also had a very extensive and impressive run list. I, myself am a rum drinker, but I opted out of getting a cocktail because I was driving.  I can say that I will definitely be back to Pirata to try other things on the menu and test out some of their rum cocktails!",

My husband and I split the fish sandwich and turkey/cream cheese panini.  The fish sandwich was the better of the two. It was a good sandwich but nothing special.  The turkey panini sounded really good on the menu but I did not like it at all. It was actually kind of gross. There was way too much turkey and not enough of the other flavors. They have a great concept with the turkey sandwich but a bad execution of it.  Also, the music, too loud! I get they wanna have a bar feel, loud music, drinks, etc., but if you are also a sit down restaurant there needs to be a happy medium. I don't feel like yelling to have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from me. The music selection was good, just turn it down a little, please.  I honestly don't think I'll be back to Pirata in the future.",

Atmosphere A+ -- perfect place to bring a date or just have a small outing with friends. Beautiful lighting and comfortable seating. Bar is stationed in the center of the restaurant and has a great variety of drinks.  Service A+ -- very friends waitress. Always came by to fill up waters or check on how we were doing. And even if she didn't always pass by directly in front of us, she was very attentive and always knew when we needed anything.  Food A+ -- wow wow wow. First of all, the flavors!! The spice and textures... I honestly cannot stop raving about this place. I got the SMOKED JACKFRUIT vegan taco ($13) and beef empanadas ($4). and because I'm a spice lover, I paired them with both of the original hot sauces they had at the table (my favorite was the mango habanero). Smoked jackfruit taco was especially unique. Looks like meat, but has the smooth and silky texture of jackfruit.  Taco skin was also made from red beets I believe.  Highly recommend.",

The chef dials back the spice so it's slightly Americanized jerk but you can heat it with the house made mango habanero sauce. They also have a milder, vinegar based red pepper sauce that it super tasty as well. I bought a bottle of each to take home and put on eggs, fish tacos, etc.",

I ordered a margarita and the guacamole trio. The margarita was just a classic marg- nothing fancy but tasted great. The guacamole, on the other hand, was short of impressive. Contrary to the multiple reviews posted here about the guac, I would not spend $12 on 3 samples of their three flavors ($16 when not on happy hour) the flavor was lackluster and my bias probably comes out of being from the west coast; I need more flavor, onions, salt, cilantro etc, something! to wow me. I would, however, tell my people to come if they're in the area for the ambience, HH drinks, and music...spend your $12 in a different way! Last, but most important for my frequent bathroom users: bathroom is clean, multiple stalls and has a trendy mirror Hallway which leads to your grand entrance into the toilet... definitely here for it.",

To drink we ordered the Jenny's Tea Cup, and Message in a Bottle, both rum based. The first is definitely more of a fruity drink (quite good), and the second mostly tastes like ginger soda with some rum (which honestly is great to me). It was cool in that it came with the dark rum in a little bottle separate to pour into the drink yourself (the message in the bottle). The dark rum lent the drink almost a maple-y aftertaste. Yum.  For main dishes we ordered the smoked jackfruit (vegetarian) tacos, which I would highly recommend- almost the texture of meat exactly! And the arroz con pollo, of which I tried the rice and it was really tasty. I felt that both dishes were a bit overpriced though, at $14 for two small tacos, and $20 something for the arroz con pollo.  They were out of the bread pudding for dessert (insert major disappointment) so we decided to try the tres leches. It was *okay* but I've had much, much better. The milk wasn't sweet enough, and the cake hadn't soaked through the whole way. The topping was too thick and didn't have much flavor.  3.5 overall because the jackfruit tacos were interesting, the rice was really good, and the service was friendly.",

It was a very vibrant salad: kale, picked watermelon rind (tasted like candy!), goat cheese, chickpeas, and honey. For some reason I expected there to be less honey drizzled on. I would've preferred less. Still a good salad though, and it came in a pretty large portion. I also ordered an empanada ($4 each). You can't come here without ordering one! I chose the Jamaican beef patty empanada and it was so tasty. (Why did I order just one?! If I come back, I totally would just order a bunch of empanadas and call it a meal.)  For drinks, I had originally ordered the Antigua Tea, which was good, but after having a sip of my friend's Jenny's Teacup and after she had a sip of my Antigua Tea, we decided to switch drinks because we liked the other person's drink better.   Good service, but I noticed that our table was not wiped before we were seated.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4",

    "text": "This place has a Rum Bible to go with their main menu. What else do you need to know?  Pirata, an Latin American rum bar, is officially one of my favorite places downtown. I had ordered empanadas to-go for lunch a while ago, but after eating here for real with my family last week it'll be hard to settle for takeout again. The decor alone sucks you in as it definitely wants to take you away from city life temporarily. There are murals of the seashore and ocean-themed colors everywhere you look. It's very bright and relaxing, if not beach-side levels of cheesy, and I love it.  And no seashore experience is complete until you've had some rum, right? Pirata's website boasts that they offer over 200 varieties of rum. There are wine and beer options as well, but I can guarantee I'll never order them here - not when the best rum cocktails I've come across are served here by very nice and prompt servers and bartenders.  On top of knowing their rum, this place's food is legit. My family and I ordered and shared their Cubano sandwich, skirt steak tacos, and and pollo frito sandwich. The pollo frito was mine - a buttermilk and jerk brined chicken sandwich with jerk BBQ, slaw, and pickles, all served with a giant side of of fries. This may be the greatest fried chicken sandwich I've eaten to date - the chicken was literally melt-in-my-mouth good, and the flavor profile that came with its toppings was just delightful. As far as I was concerned, my meal was the best thing at our table.  Not that the other entrees were bad. The Cubano was pretty good, although it's more of a Cuban panini than a proper Cuban sandwich. If they ever decide to use proper Cuban bread I'd order a sandwich for myself instantly, because the toppings themselves were quite tasty and well prepped. The steak tacos were downright delicious, and in addition to featuring tender and fresh ingredients they were one of the spicier items my table ordered. The other contender for most spicy dish was the mac and cheese, which my family ordered to share. This is very good thick and creamy mac and cheese, but be aware of what you're getting into when you order it - otherwise your tastebuds are in for a big surprise!  The only downside of the meal for us was that the fries the sandwiches came with were easily the saltiest things I've eaten in recent memory. We're talking \"saltier than fast food fries\" salty; no one wanted to eat more than a couple handfuls of them during dinner (they actually got better after being reheated at home). I would definitely not complain if the kitchen backed off on the salt and I'll likely avoid ordering meals that come with the fries in the future (although hopefully Pirata will let me substitute a different side? We'll see!).  Like I said, this place is now one of my favorite places downtown - if I could give them a 4.5 I would, as they are just a few menu tweaks away from being perfect. I expect that I'll be back again soon, as the main courses, desserts, and drinks alike are all calling my name. Definitely come in soon, and drink up me hearties!",

I didn't love the idea of a Caribbean restaurant because I'm just not a huge fan of that type of food. I typically would not have picked this place but I was very impressed and eager to try something new! I got the salmon salad that was on special that night...omg amazing! One of the best salads I've had. The piece of salmon was a decent size but the flavor was nothing special. The rest of the salad and dressing made up for it! I hope next time I go back that salad is on special again. I also got the Mac n cheese. I had to try it. It's not your traditional Mac n cheese, it had a kick to it but I liked it. My friends got the steak tacos and enjoyed them. They also seemed like a good size, 2 tacos per order. If you're a rum drinker then you must go! They offer a very extensive rum list. I recommend if you're looking to try something new!",

We had pineapple guacamole with plantain chips to start. It was very tasty! The chips tasted maybe a little stale to me, but maybe that's just the texture of them. It wasn't awful. We each had tacos as our meal. I had the fish tacos, hubby had steak. Both were excellent and surprisingly spicy- served with some interesting homemade salsas to add some extra flavor. Quite yummy. We also each had a drink- a mojito and a margarita- they were good as well. The best parts of this place are the decor, service and wonderfully flavorful food. It's quite an experience if you take the time to look around. Murals, private rooms you can peek in, bathrooms are cool, too! One star missing because the cost is a little high for what you are getting. Drink prices were high, too. But hey, it's a nice night out. Would definitely come back!",

We went with a large group and were put into their back room, which I imagine is available as an event space.  There were interesting paintings on the walls, but we couldn't tell what one of them was.  Potentially a Kracken? The chairs and table are large, which gives you a lot of room to spread out while you're eating.  I ordered the jerk chicken tacos and they were very good, but the taco shell could barely contain them, and they were served on a cutting-board-esque platter without edges.  I ended up losing a decent amount of my dish to the table.  Also, there was no warning how spicey my dish was going to be.  This was fine for me, but one of my friends ordered the same thing and had to have a new dish made for her since she doesn't like spice.  My husband ordered the veggie curry and really liked his dish a lot.  He now wants to eat more vegetarian options at home.   I think the food was good, but the tacos were a little bit pricey.",

We decided to sit at the bar and were greeted by Randolf, who ended up taking care of us for the next several hours. Every cocktail we ordered was based off of bartenders recommendations after asking about what we liked. He was spot on each time with the next drink being better then the previous. I highly suggest the Zombie flight and the Bruja cocktail (skull glass in the pictures).   For food, the smoked pineapple guacamole is absolutely incredible. After a surprising recommendation for the coconut shrimp we gave them a shot. Coconut shrimp, in my opinion tend to be the same everywhere. Over cooked with some random sugary concoction for a dip. Not at Pirata though.  There were 4 massive shrimp, fried perfectly so that the shrimp were still tender served with a spicy but slightly sweet chutney and curry sauces. They were amazing. Our entrees were the jerk chicken and the fish fry (Cobia this occasion), both excellent as well.  It was 5 degrees outside but the rum was flowing keeping us nice and warm inside all night. My wife and I actually closed up the bar that evening and were the last customers out the door. Time flies when you're having rum! Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Well my Yelp friends, Yelp led me to Pirata and it didn't disappoint! The food had good flavor and it is unique to what else you can find downtown. Arriving at 11:45 for a Friday lunch was great timing as only a few other tables had been taken at that point. The staff was incredibly friendly and were ready to answer questions and make suggestions.  There were three of us, and we decided to try the Cuban Sandwich Bites (app), each had an Empanada, and then we shared the Mac & Cheese and the sweet plantains. Hands down, the Empanadas took the prize. These things were delicious, meaty, pockets of YUM! Each one is $3 and there are two beef flavors and one chicken. The man who delivered the food offered hot sauce, and yes! I added that to the salsa that comes with it for a great tasting, spicy treat.   I knew from another review that the mac & cheese had a nutmeg flavor to it. It was good, but as the three of us discussed, we think we'd probably want to focus on other things before trying it again. Both people I dined with liked the cuban bites quite a bit - but we were all surprised that they came out looking more like egg rolls (check out my picture to see) but were still very good! I'm not a big honey mustard fan, but it didn't deter me from trying, and I'd try them again.  Although we all agreed we were full from the dishes the waitress mentioned the bread pudding for dessert, and I just couldn't pass it up. Bananas, walnuts... sounded like magic. Unfortunately this was our least favorite part. While the dish and the outer ring of the dessert was \"scalding hot\" as the waitress warned us - the center of the dessert was very cold. Some of the crust had a burnt taste to it as well, so while I\"m hoping it was a fluke, I don't think I'd spend the money again to find out. As I mentioned, the service was very friendly but at times felt slow, so rushed lunchers may want to wait until you have some buffer time just in case it is busy.",

    "text": "Stopped here before a wedding reception to grab drinks and were both pleasantly surprised. We sat at the bar and the ambiance was nice... Cozy chairs with red velvet seats and a bright picture of the sea painted on the side wall. They have a back room that also holds about 30. My husband had a red stripe and I sipped on a few glasses of wine, which were both reasonably priced. We decided to try a beef patty as well. The exterior of the patty was flaky, and although the meat inside was not the juiciest ever, it was not dry either; it was an average patty, according to my Jamaican husband. It came with a delicious red sauce for dipping, which was mild and flavor. This particular sauce was not traditional to Jamaican culture, but it did pair well with the beef patty. The waitstaff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable of menu items. Bathrooms were well-kept. The only downfall noted is there is no happy hour- would have loved to come back for drinks but maybe they will change that in the future.. Hooks under the bar do not exist for purses ladies, but that's a minor detail. We can't wait to try the jerk chicken during our next visit!",

The picadillo had no raisins in it as it traditionally should and there was no taste of onions, sofrito or tomato paste. Very bland. Secondly, the \"jerk\" chicken is just oven baked chicken with Walkerwoods jerk wet rub on it (not house made). Not marinated. No bueno. The \"smoked\" guacamole had bacon in it, which wasn't mentioned on the menu, and should be considered for people who don't eat pork. The ox tail was the MOST fatty I've ever had. And I grew up on ox tail. The whole dish was corn meal, beans, bone and fat. For $26? You're better off going to Leon's Caribbean or Royal Caribbean for oxtail, more meat and $13 cheaper.",

The food was delicious and the server was nice but then several hours later things began going down hill. My mother began vomiting and running to the bathroom, then my grandmother, then my 8yr old, then my 5 year old, then me, then my husband and lastly my 1yr old. Im 6 months pregnant & had to stay up all night with sweats & intense cramps. God forbid something were to happen to my unborn baby. I spent the entire morning trying to take care of husband & 1 yr old since things set in for them around 5am. Having to watch my child scream & vomit several times was obviously not enjoyable. Was supppsed to take my kids to a birthday party that they had been waiting all month to go to but we are all stuck at home trying to recover. Im so disappointed that such a great night took a turn for the worst. I never thought this would happen to me as I have never had food poisoning before especially while carrying a baby :( Thankfully some of us are beginning to feel better but we sure will not be recommending this establishment to anyone. I hope this did not occur to anyone else or to anyone in the future.",

She never asked if we wanted anything to drink, and overcharged us.  I ate the food that was delivered, my friend requested what she/we originally ordered.  My jerk chicken entree should have been cooked a bit more, the rice and beans were dry, but the greens were tender and flavorful. My chicken was not undone, but was not tender. I understand that it's a newly opened restaurant but if you want repeat customers, you should strive to provide excellent service. This was not even decent.

By night's end we all agreed that this is one special restaurant.  Two of us had mahi tacos, which were reminiscient of the mouth watering ones my wife and I once had in Fort Lauderdale.   Two had fried grouper. I was afforded a taste and concurred with the diners that it was spectacular.  Moist yet fully cooked. Done just right and flavorful. I can't recall all the others (9 or 10 went) but all loved the food. Needless to say we had to try the rum. The rum flights are so worth it. I had 2 and was finding all to be good. I erred in ordering a VERY costly highly aged rum, and the manager was the epitome of gracious and kindly took it back since I hadn't tasted it. Holly was our server, and she too was a pleasure, like everything else. From the greeting as we walked in till we left, the entire staff was very pleasant and attentive. We all agreed we are DEFINITELY going back!",

We visited During the first Saturday Brunch and it was nothing short of spectacular.  Definitely try the Chorizo tacos with fried egg, Larso Tacos and ALL of the empanadas, each was spectacular but our favorite was the Jamaican beef patty with a perfect blend of Caribbean spices. We had the opportunity to try the watermelon honey salad and ceviche trio that were both out of this world.  The Chef Josh and Bob one of the owners stopped by and gave us great insights into the inspiration to the restaurant and history that made our visit very special.

    "text": "Easily made reservations for a Saturday at 6:30 for a party of 4. Automated text messages the day and a half an hour before to confirm/remind reservation time.   Arrived early, our table was ready but we asked to sit at the bar for a while to wait for our friends/grab a drink. Nice drink menu! Lots of rum, cocktails, wine and beer selections. Among our group we had the Mojito Royals, Mutiny on the Bounty, the Caribbean Julep and the house red. Everything was great - but the Caribbean Julep was overloaded with ice and was difficult to drink.   After a drink we decided to go to our table, where we waited probably 10 minutes for our waitress to arrive. Not a huge deal, but we didn't have drinks (water or alcoholic) so it was a bit annoying. When she did arrive she was pleasant and helpful. We ordered drinks (just the house red/white) and the Cuban Sandwich Bites and Pineapple Guacamole for starters. Loved them!  Each couple shared two varieties of the Caribbean Rotis: pork belly and jerk chicken. Warning! The jerk chicken is spicy. You get to taco-like tortillas with each order and it's convenient for sharing. The pork belly was awesome with the mashed plantains. We also got an order of the Jamaican street corn (off the cob in a crock) and it was AMAZING. Along with the tostones and sweet plantains we loved our food.   I would have no problem returning or recommending this restaurant to a friend. Definitely a good spot to meet with friends for drinks/small bites or a meal for date night. 4 stars for slower service after seating and an overload of ice in the julep.",

A definitely great find for a road warrior.  Their jerk chicken tacos were as desired for a taco lover. In particular they offer really innovative hot sauces with mango base, pineapple base, and one other i can't remember. Very different and really interesting and satisfying.",

    "text": "Last night my husband and I stopped at Pirata before the Pens game. We were seated immediately. The decor is nice and it really makes you feel like you are somewhere other than Pittsburgh. The staff was immediately friendly and welcoming and ready to take care of us.   We ordered the banana walnut old fashioned and the rum punch. Both had a great smooth flavor and the old fashioned was unique and not very overwhelming on the banana flavor. As it turns out, our waitress let us know they infuse their own rum. So the banana was not some fake syrup, but True banana.   We ordered a little of everything to get the feel of the restaurant. We started with the conch fritters. They were delicate and spiced perfectly. The dipping sauce for them was creamy and sweet with only a slight kick of heat at the end that was barely detectable. We had to wait a bit longer for this as they had to remake them, and the owner personally stopped over to apologize and took care of us the rest of the evening. Truly exceptional customer service (so important these days especially at a downtown establishment!).   For the main course we got the empanadas, yuca fries, and tacos. Everything was delightful! The empanadas were filling and tasty. Each with a different dough and filling. The dipping sauces complimented them perfectly. They were a decent size as well. My husband devoured the tacos and the waitress let us know they marinate the meat for 12 hours to make sure it is extra tender.   I think they have over 250 rums to try so we will definitely be back to sample more.",

I'm not usually a fan of themed restaurants, but I was thinking about a prior trip to St. Thomas and hoped it would let me escape dreary Pittsburgh. It didn't disappoint.   Spiked ginger beer and amazing conch fritters. I could've stopped there and died happy. Is it allowed to say that the conch fritters were better than the ones I get in the Caribbean? The mustard is great, but the new hot sauce was out of this world. Bottle that and sell it, at least to me.   I had beef tacos that were just ok. They have stiff competition from Tako and Bakersfield, which I love, so I'm not sure that I would have them again. They weren't bad, just nothing as special as the fritters.   I wrapped it up with the flan. Itwas a nice consistency and if you like really sweet desserts (I do), it won't disappoint. I will definitely be back. It hasn't been open long, so you should all go give it a shot and welcome them to Pittsburgh.",

I'd recommend a more upbeat DJ or just sticking with a pre-made playlist, depending on what vibe the restaurant is going for.

The steak tacos were bad though... meat wasn't great quality and they were dripping grease.  The bartender had a warm personality and was very efficient. A disabled man also came in while we were there and the staff was very accommodating without being overbearing which is always nice to see. The bar is  right in the front so you have to fight your way through people to get to the dining area but they did the best job there could with the space.

We chose black bean soup, which comes in a generous bowl, authentic empanadas, a grouper (yes grouper!) taco, and a perfectly-dressed salad full mixed greens, olives, and grilled cheese cubes.  While we had wine and beer, their cocktail menu beats Caribbean with creative combinations.

Naturally, I tried everyone else's drinks, too. They were all delicious and the prices were fair for good drinks downtown.   We mostly ordered lunch sandwiches. They were very generously portioned and super tasty. It was refreshing to enjoy authentic Caribbean flavors. You have to ask for their house papaya hot sauce. It was hot, but soooo so good.   Will definitely be back again. Such a little gem downtown with a good atmosphere. Also worth mentioning, the gorgeous comfortable chairs and nice big tables. Too many downtown spots are crammed and uncomfortable.",

    "text": "We came here after seeing a 2:00 show at the Benedum. We had a 6:30 reservation and arrived a bit early ( after having a coffee and glass of wine at Market St.) but were seated promptly in the rear. It is a fun space, with Caribbean music in the background and a themed movie on the big screen ( on our visit it was  \"Muppets Treasure Island \"). Our waitress was kind and willing to share her opinions; we were, however, surprised at the amount of time it took to get our drinks. My husband had the Around the World  rum flight, and I had their Manhattan. He enjoyed the rum and my drink was slightly sweet for a manhattan but enjoyable nonetheless.   As a meal, I ordered the dry rub jerk wings and collard greens, and my husband the goat tacos and mac and cheese. We split an order of the fries, and after seeing the size of the portions also ordered the pork belly tacos to share. The food was good, yet, as noted, the portions were small for the price. The tacos come in twos with minimal fillings (much smaller than nearby Tako) and the collards and mac and cheese were in very small cast iron skillets. The wings had an excellent flavor, and my husband wondered how they infused the jerk flavor beyond the skin-possibly marinated? The collards have a unique flavor; we loved the infusion of coconut milk and spice and might try to replicate it at home!  We were here on a Saturday night and by 8 many tables were free. We would like to go again, but possibly just for happy hour. We hope they continue to improve and expand their portion size. Interesting new addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene!",

    "text": "Startup...is it still a startup after 7 weeks?  Startup restaurant in an already highly competitive downtown area.    It was good, not great, so I hope it holds on because...  Some intriguing options...a rum bar with 200 varieties of rum?  I feel like this is a good idea...a rum option for the folks who have exhausted the ryes, whiskeys and wines of other spirited competition (see what I did there?  spirited?  like...spirits?).  Caribbean theme too is a bit different than the run-of-the-mill in Pittsburgh.    We sat at a high table along the wall.  The seats didn't have a foot rest, so half the people just dangled their feet off the edge of their seats like toddlers at the grown up table.  The waiter came off rude and disinterested at first but honestly, I just think he was extremely dry.  By the end of the meal we found him quite entertaining.   The manager visited our table and apologized (not that we'd complained) proactively about 'getting the kinks worked out' and explained that he was unhappy with some of the menu and decor (he indicated that the current menu is only a partial of what it ultimately will become).  And in truth, I thought the menu was a little entree light.    Cuban/Dominican/Jamaican fare...we visited on the day Castro died and I had Ropa Vieja.  It seemed fitting.  It tasted vaguely communist, but in all seriousness was again...good not great.  I thought it was well-prepared and tasty, but there's only so much you can do with skirt steak, rice, and beans.    I had a Mojito Royale which was really good, and a Golden Hind...which came across as \"Kamikaze in a nice glass\".  I had another drink, but I'm getting two elderly to remember what it was.  I'm cautiously optimistic about the place.  I'd like to go back and try one of the rum/cocktail flights.  That looked like fun, but wasn't really what I was looking for when we visited.  I feel like there's a place for Pirata once they get their sea legs.  I'll go back and give it another whirl.",

I also think I've had the ropa viejo and enjoyed it.  None of the food is very spicy. You can ask for a hot sauce made in the restaurant that is amazing. Really good heat, really good flavor.  The bar is good. I've only had the beer though, so I can't speak to any sorts of 'island' cocktails.  As a note, mention you're on a lunch break and review the menu ahead of time if you've got a deadline.",

    "text": "I will absolutely be back!   The place is new (just over 5 weeks) so they were still working out the kinks I think. I was here for a business lunch and it was a good spot. It's bustling but not too loud. One thing that amazed me is that even though there is not vestibule, it doesn't get freezing in the front of the restaurant when someone opens the door. The magic of architecture I guess.   The menu is small but has choices for everyone. Our waitress was knowledgeable and pointed us towards adding a side onto the tacos. While it makes a \"meal\" more expensive -- it's definitely necessary. The two tacos, while hearty, would not have been enough for a full lunch.   I went with the pork tacos and the mac and cheese \"pie.\" It was an awesome choice. The tacos were phenomenal. The shell was crispy but flexible. The meat was perfectly marinated and the toppings were perfectly complimentary. The taco stayed together perfectly while eating. The mac and cheese -- it's not really \"pie\" more just like baked mac and cheese. It was a bit spicy but amazing, and stayed hot the whole time which was huge for me.   Our food took a REALLY long time. Like almost an hour long. But the owner/manager came over and told us he was buying the whole meal before we even complained, which I thought was excellent. I'm not one to complain and I probably wouldn't have done so, but that fact that he was proactive left me with an amazing impression and wanting to return. also, the food was well worth the wait.   It's pricey, but for a date night or special occasion I would be back in a heartbeat. I also saw they have bigger rooms in the back that would be great for groups which is cool.",

Our waiters were at our table immediately and the first mojitos were in our hands in a flash...and they were crafted to perfection (just like Cuba, according to one of our party).  We tried a number of the apps, all good...the adobo chicken wings were my favorite (ask to have the cilantro yogurt dipping sauce in addition to the blue cheese).  We also tried a couple of salads...the watermelon and honey one was particularly refreshing.   The entrees arrived as we were sampling a flight of rums. We tried all of the Caribbean tacos...the plantain crusted mahi mahi was amazing, and my friend raved about the curried goat with goat cheese. The jerk chicken was just right...not overly spicy and was a good complement to the heat of some of the tacos. So were the sweet plantains.   Speaking of sweet, we topped everything by sharing a serving of their decadent tres leches, which arrived just as the DJ started to play dance music, giving the place a fun late night beat. Bottom line: I look forward to coming back.",
