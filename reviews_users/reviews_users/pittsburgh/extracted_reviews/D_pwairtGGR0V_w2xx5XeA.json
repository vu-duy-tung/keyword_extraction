You can tell it is home made and the flavor is outstanding. My entree is called \"iskender kebab\" but it isn't served on a kebab at all, but in a skillet over chucks of buttery bread that resembles home fries. Some of the best lamb I have had in a while. Only downside to this place is it is BYOB. I grabbed a six pack accross the street but will bring my own Cabernet next time!  First time I have ever had traditional baklava. Not your normal baklava. Trust me, you have never had this type before! Very good!",

I chose the chicken soup and it tasted like my great-grandmothers (who raised and butchered her own chickens), and used the lemon on the side to freshen. My main course was the chicken shish kabob and the meat was tender and tasty, the rice was buttery and perfectly cooked and the side salad was fresh and crisp. Their homemade Turkish bread was some of the best I've ever had. My sister cleaned her plate with the sea bass and my grandmother spoke highly of the lamb shish kebob. They have such a diverse menu it was hard to choose a main dish, but Daria was such a pleasant and knowledgeable server, she was able to answer questions and suggest plates. We will be back several times to work our way through the menu.",

Molly even gave us additional cucumber sauce to bring home.",

Our waitress was nice, and we were seated almost immediately. We tried the calamari, which could have used a tiny bit more seasoning, but was delicious nonetheless. The Turkish bread was unexpectedly flavorful. My mom tried the Lamb Shish Kebab, and I tried the Lamb Adana Kebab. The kebab was probably one of the most tender and juicy pieces of meat I've ever tasted. The rice really tied the dish together. Overall, Alihan's is a great restaurant for lunch and probably an even better place for a date. I have to try the baklava the next time I come here. I heard it was pretty awesome.",

Because their menu is posted on Yelp it made my choice easy. While turning onto 6th Street from Duquesne Blvd. ( while using the map app associated with Yelp) we noticed a parking garage directly beside Alihan's . Upon entering we were seated and ordered appetizers . Hummus and charred eggplant. My wife ordered falafels and I ordered lamb chop kebab . Service was superb as the waitress described our dishes and offered to answer any other questions that we may have had . Meals were served in a very timely fashion and were delicious. The atmosphere was very classy and modern yet the price was very fair in my opinion. We enjoyed our meal and coffee and did not leave hungry (we took a couple items home ) .  The dessert menu looked great but we were too full to partake.  We look forward to returning and exploring the rest of the menu .",

The very friendly hostess seated us immediately on the patio and returned quickly with water and menus. My daughter (a vegetarian) and I split the cold appetizer combination plate, which had a little bit of everything. Delish! The dish was fresh, attractively presented, with substantial portions, and accompanied by a basket of warm bread. The charred eggplant and the salty feta were outstanding - so good that my daughter ordered a second serving of the eggplant for dessert! The only thing I'd change would be to add a bit more garlic and salt to the hummus.  For entrees, I had the lamb shishkebab with bulgur, and my daughter had the vegetarian saute. Both were delicious. The lamb was tender and tasty, and enough for a full meal plus leftovers to take home. The saute, a mix of vegetables in a tomato-based sauce, was flavorful and satisfying. Service throughout was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed it all.  The meal wasn't cheap, but we found it well worth the price for good quality and portion sizes. We seriously considered returning the next day for another delicious meal!",

We ordered the Chef Borek appetizer and doner kebab with wheat bulgur. The appetizer, goat cheese in fried phyllo dough, was delicious both with and without the tomato marmalade. One order has one piece. The entree also came with salad. Everything was beautifully plated and delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I scraped up every last grain of bulgur.

However, most problematic was that 3 individuals in our party of 4 were served and waited over 10 minutes before the 4th individual was served.  Nothing was explained to us and I finally had to get up from the table to find our waitress to let her know we are still waiting for our 4th individual to be served.....and this individual was only having a salad!!!

My husband is a sucker for a good good Mediterranean place him and I would do anything to find a good kebab place because we love our kebabs more than our abs! Hahahaha! But on a serious note if you're in 'burgh and hunting down for a good place to eat and amazing service look no further alihan is your spot! Try their mixed platter two people can easily share that it comes with all the kebabs in their menu.. full of flavor,tender, juicy,moist all the things one would want for their meat to be! Love it!",

Thank God we found Alihan's. We were travelling with our 18month old and he was still sleeping by dinner time so it was nice to know they delivered to our hotel. We ordered the Mixed Grill, the grilled sea bass, calamari and charred eggplant dip. The calamari was still crispy, the meats were flavorful, but the best part was the grilled fish, especially with a squeeze of the grilled lemon. The food would have obviously stayed at temperature if we had eaten at the restaurant, and it would have been nice to have some olive oil for the bread and dip, so next time we're in Pittsburgh we will stop by. Thanks again for a good meal!",

I had the Iskender Kebab and the stuffed grape leaves - the grape leaves were a little lacking in flavor but the kebab was deelish. My friend had the white bean salad and said it was a bit bland, like the beginning ingredients with which you later make a complete recipe.  All in all, I'd try it again.",

We ordered mixed kebab and Izmir Chupra (an Aegean fish) and Ayran for drink. I left one star out because our Ayran was not good! It was a little bit watery and no salt. I prepare better Ayran at home. Other than that our waiter brought us the wrong fish. We had to wait another 25 minutes for our fish. But then the owner arrived and we learned that Izmir Chupra is not frozen fish! It is shipped from Turkey via overnight shipping! It was amazing and it tastes fresh like the ones we eat in Izmir (I am from Izmir BTW). Owner also offered us Kunefe (a Turkish dessert origined in Southern Turkey) from the house. We will definitely visit here again and hopefully they will not have these issues again after reading our review :)",

He gave a perfunctory apology, but he did not do anything else you might consider appropriate in the circumstances--not even a token gesture of a plate of hummus or something while waiting the inordinate amount of time the simple lunch specials took to arrive finally. He did act like he would pat my crotch for me, but I declined. To prove it was no fluke this waiter spent the rest of the meal repeatedly proving that terrible service is indeed de rigueur. I eventually had to head towards the kitchen myself to ask for part of our meals that were forgotten, and after a lengthy wait we took our check up ourselves to pay. Yes, of course, because despite this waiter making me look incontinent and making me spend the rest of the day at the office with a soaked suit, I was still thoughtfully charged the full price for this experience.   The \"salad\" should have been in a nursing home, it was so elderly. Completely inedible; it probably tasted worse than your average nursing home resident, but with more discoloration.   There was a woman there who seemed to be some sort of manager but she didn't even take her earbuds out when wishing us a \"good day\" as we walked out the door.   I strongly recommend avoiding this place.",

We came in a Saturday night without a reservation and luckily were able to get a table. I would not recommend going without a reservation because the place is very tiny, we just got lucky like I said. It was much more of an upscale restaurant than I had envisioned with cloth tablecloths and napkins. I saw at least 2 tables that brought their own wine, personal note made for next visit. We started off with a hi mmus appetizer because we both love hummus. It came with an when style bread and you could definitely tell it was freshly made. Delicious. Same goes for the entrees, the Lamb Shish Kebabs and the Chicken Kofte. Both came with your choice of rice or bulgar, and both dishes were just the perfect Mediterranean blend if seasonings on perfectly cooked meats. We didn't have room for dessert this time but I definitely want to try their rice pudding, baklava or kadayif!",

I have not been to Istanbul but this place's decor and vibe seems to transport you to the ancient city.  We ordered baba ghanoush for appetizer. It came with a complimentary side of olive oil dip and some fresh bread. I liked the consistency of the eggplant dip (which our server told us they don't call baba ghanoush in Turkish. It has a different name but same dish. Baba ghanoush is the Arabic counterpart of the same dish). I did feel like the baba ghanoush at Istanbul Sofra was much more tastier though.  We ordered seafood ravioli with shrimp on top, lamb adana kabob and chicken saute with lemon cream sauce. The kabob/chicken saute came with rice. The food was delicious. I did not taste the ravioli but my brother loved it. We ended our delicious meal with Turkish tea which was presented in Turkish manner. Our server was a sweet lady who chatted with us regarding the making of tea. Overall, a very pleasant experience.",

Jeweled art around the room, unique shaped lights hanging from the ceiling, and outdoor seating. Chairs outside were a bit weirdly shaped for seating. *Music: N/A* Only the sounds of the city reverberate into the restaurant amongst the chatter. *Food presentation: 4/5* Hummus was cute. The calamari was a basic design, surrounding the sauce. LARGE plates, proportionate to their cost. The mixed kebab is an assortment of well placed meats and vegetables with the rice in the middle and vegetables in the corners. Was nice placement, but it felt like there could've been a better design.   *Flavor: 4.8/5* Hummus and calamari tasted quite fresh. Calamari was soft and easy to chew while the hummus came in a gracious amount.Rice and salad was lightly flavored...ideal for the spiced and flavored variety of meats. Some meats were a bit tougher than others, some were grilled to a light char, and others were right on point in texture. My friends were less keen on the tougher meats, but I enjoyed them. *Price: 4.8/5* Our meal ended up about 22 dollars per person. It felt pretty fair for the type of restaurant while getting an the calamari and hummus appetizers. The appetizers were DEFINITELY worth it. *Service: 4/5* The service was quite friendly, though it seems we were misunderstood at times. It felt mediocre overall, but was easy going when dealing with how to split the payment. *Bathrooms: 3.5/5* It's a small, single person bathroom. I think it was pretty well decorated. It even has a bidet! It's a bit dimly lit and the room was a little moist. There was condensation on top of the facilities, so it felt weird to flush.  Would I come back again? Maybe. Probably not. It was pleasant, a little more expensive than what I'd hope for, but overall a good experience once.  Final thoughts: I was glad to experience the food, but I feel there are better Mediterranean restaurants out there for better prices. I'll keep looking.",

    "text": "I work downtown and have walked past Alihans many of times. There always seems to be a lot of people eating inside and in the summer you can sit outside too! What is nice about this restaurant is its location. It's attached to the Fort Duquesne and 6th Street garage and The Byham Theatre is right a cross the street. I believe that parking is $7 after 4 o'clock.   I made reservations through Yelp for my parents and I for a Friday night. When we arrived around 4, I looked around and noticed practically all of the tables had reserved signs on them. I was relieved to have had those reservations.   From 11 am - 11 pm they offer complementary wine (a red that can't remember the name of and Chardonnay). My dad picked the red and my mom and I went with Chardonnay. They did run out of the Chardonnay so we had to wait until someone went to buy more. They are not skimpy drinks by any means. Half the glass was filled and I will say it was a very good Chardonnay!   Our waitress brought out Turkish bread and a dipping oil that had an olive tapenade in it. We really enjoyed this! For our meals I ordered the doner kabab ($14), my mom ordered the chicken shish kabab ($16), and my dad ordered the chicken saute ($16). For our sides we all went with rice. I will say they did give you a lot of food for the price. When I'm eating at ethnic restaurants I really find it helpful when the menu items have descriptions. If there isn't a picture to show me what the dish looks like, I like reading all that is in it at least and Alihan's didn't fail to deliver that to me.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely come back to try more dishes.",

We came early around 5:45 and were seated right away. The Turkish bread was delicious, I had to force myself to only eat two to save room for dinner. I definitely recommend the hummus-it's homemade. I had the lamb adana with half rice pilaf and half bulgar rice (both were tasty). The lamb adana was seasoned well (they give you two long strips) and their tzatziki yogurt sauce was perfect (light and more stiff). The plate also comes with salad; I couldn't even finish! Great prices and generous amount of food! Friendly service too!",

I ordered the vegetarian saute, which was good, the portion was small, but they also served it with rice and bread. I wasn't a big fan of the rice. My husband had the lamb, which he said was dry.

    "text": "Whenever my friends and I visit the Cultural District to see a show, there are two questions that are first and foremost in my mind: (1) Are we going to have dinner beforehand? (2) If so, where?  As the resident foodie, the task often falls to me to recommend places and convince my friends to try somewhere more novel than Chipotle or Noodles & Co., even if it's a bit more expensive and takes a bit longer.  I always look for places that are (1) well-reviewed, (2) novel, and (3) within our budget (i.e., $-$$).  Alihan's fit all of those constraints, so I came here with two friends for dinner yesterday before seeing a PSO concert at Heinz Hall up the street.   Having reviewed the reviews beforehand, I knew Alihan's was known for their kunefe dessert, so I suggested that we try it, and my friends agreed.  (Note: I rarely order dessert at normal restaurants unless something really piques my interest, since I tend to prefer heading to an ice cream parlor instead.)  Since we were on a somewhat constrained schedule, we ordered the dessert at the same time that we ordered our entrees, which worked out well.  Spoiler alert: The dessert was as great as everyone claimed!  I'd never had kunefe before, but my friends had and they agreed it was good.  I loved the sweet/salty and crunchy/chewy combinations that it contained--it reminded me of shredded wheat with cheese and syrup! If you haven't ever tried this unique and tasty dessert, Alihan's is a great place to do so!  For entrees, one friend and I ordered the chicken adana kebob, and my other friend ordered the kofte (meatball) kebob, since Alihan's seems to specialize in kebobs.   According to my one friend who tried both, they were both very good and tasted very different.  (I can only speak for the chicken kebob, since I don't eat red meat.)  The chicken kebob was well-seasoned and savory but not spicy.  I'm guessing it was toned down to adapt to the local palate, since it usually has some heat to it, but I was okay with that since I tolerate spicy food but don't seek it out.  Both dishes came with a side of rice or bulgur, so we ordered the latter, and it was also well-seasoned.  The grilled vegetables were less impressive, but I did like the sauce (lemon vinaigrette?) that they were dressed with.  Portions were quite large, to the point that all of us left some food on our plates (we couldn't take leftovers with us because we were attending a show afterwards, but otherwise, we would have!).  Aside from the food, we enjoyed the ambiance, which is more upscale-ish for a moderately priced restaurant (though I'm not sure how I feel about the paper covering the table linens...).  Service was very efficient and professional, which we appreciated given our time constraints.  The Greek restaurant next door would do well to take a page out of their book re: the food, service, and ambiance.  Based on our experience, I'd definitely recommend Alihan's for dinner before a show in the Cultural District, if you're looking for a place to eat downtown!",

    "text": "Decided to try Alihan's on a Sunday before a Pirates game. Figured it was right near the Clemente bridge, so we could park for the game in one of the nearby garages. I also saw that they had a Sunday brunch and an extensive delicious-sounding menu.   We pulled into the garage around 11 am, which happened to be RIGHT next to Alihan's (and I think the closest garage in downtown to the Clemente bridge). How convenient!! AND, the event rate was $7! $7 for a garage close to PNC park?! Unbeatable!!!  We were a little skeptical walking into Alihan's - not one table was occupied. But we decided to proceed. Very nice inside - linen tablecloths and napkins. The front doors were wide open, and we briefly considered sitting on the front patio, but decided against it since it was starting to heat up quite a bit outside. They brought out menus, but I didn't see anything about a brunch menu, so I asked. The hostess was very apologetic, said she forgot it was Sunday, and brought some other brunch menus. We had some great coffees, and ordered a hummus app. It was a nice sized dish, accompanied by some really good Turkish bread. I ordered off the brunch menu - a cheese omelet, and my companion ordered off the regular menu - doner, which is basically gyro meat. After I saw his plate I knew I should have gone with something off their regular menu. It was a huge portion of perfectly charred lamb, with a nice side salad and a portion of bulgur. My omelet was perfectly fine, although somewhat generic, and came with a nice side of sliced tomatoes and cucumbers.  After stuffing ourselves, we sat and sipped coffee, watching the procession of fans walk by to the Pirate game since we were a bit early, and the waitress was very nice to let us sit and kept our coffees and waters filled. By a little after noon, a few other people had come in to dine. All in all, I have to say it was a PERFECTLY leisurely way to ensure getting to the ballgame on time, eat great food and drink great coffee beforehand, and get a bargain on close-in parking. Will DEFINITELY do this again on my next Sunday game!",

The hummus and pita are probably the best things here, in addition to the Turkish coffee.  I ordered the cold appetizer platter, charred eggplant, and shepherd salad. I enjoyed the appetizer platter. It comes with hummus, tabouleh, eggplant, wrapped grape leaves, and a few other insignificant things (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sauce, etc.).   Don't order the shepherd salad. It's just a bunch of chopped cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes. I was disappointed. The charred eggplant was simply a below-average dip. Perhaps restaurants need to put down in what form or style the food comes in.  The waitresses are nice. They are all easy on the eyes, too.",

My wife had a shrimp dish with generous serving of perfectly cooked shrimp. I would highly recommend this restaurant... and not think twice about bringing your kids.",

We got there a bit early and they got us right in. The staff was great. Very polite and helpful. We started with Turkish Tea and Calamari. My wife had the North Atlantic Salmon and I had the Lamb Chop Kebabs.  Everything was delicious.

While the place already seemed pretty popular, we were blown away by the quality of the food and how great the staff were.

Quality of food is going to make you feel that you are in a Restaurant in Istanbul. Soft music  at the background is well chosen.

We brought our wine with us and the waiter, though apparently somewhat confused, uncorked and brought us glasses. Then my friend ordered the falafel and I ordered the lamb Adana kabob. The waiter asked me \" are you sure you want to order that?\" I asked if there's something wrong with it. Again, confused, he said that he thought I'd ordered something else. Somewhat disconcerting, I thought. Both dishes were delicious. Falafel done perfectly, my lamb tasty and just enough spice to it. Finished up with baklava and Turkish tea. Yummy!! We will certainly come here again. Would have definitely given it a 5 except for the waiter.",

    "text": "I have two favorite middle eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this is one of them. They are both tied for number one in my mind and I'm waiting for the day one takes the victory.  4 stars only because I love well made Pita bread, but hey that's okay. Turkish bread is cool with me.  This chef knows how to cook. I have dined in Cappadocia, Istanbul, Santorini, and Beirut. I have even dined middle eastern in NYC, most notably Queens, NYC.  This place is the bomb.  My god this chef got the flavors and cooking style totally down.  4 stars only because of consistency, and I look for it.  This restaurant is nicely situated downtown right before some bridge (four years abhi, four years and you still don't know your way around Pittsburgh. SMH).  Anyhow, great location, excellent interior for the size and space, and can actually be romantic. Dim the lights more maybe ton give it that flare (if they're looking for it).  The services was wonderful, and never needed a reservation to get a table (even outside on their little outdoor patio).  First up, of course, the way you test middle eastern food is akin to tasting who makes a good slice..taste their \"plain cheese pizza.\" In this case, it's the hummus.  God almighty it was wonderful. Perfect texture, the right blend of beans, herbs, and the right amount of garlic.  Great start. Next up, the bread with the hummus was a great treat. The tabbouleh was okay, a little TOO heavy on the parsley, but not bad.   Now for the feast.   I got the grilled meat platter and devoured it whole. All the meats were cooked to perfection, the vegetables had the right amount of char and smoke to them, and the lamb was succulent and juicy. The chicken as perfect, and I LOVE Adana kababs and Tawook, and man this guy knows how to marinade meat. My friend doesn't eat red meat so he got the melt in your mouth sea bass..and it proceeded to fall apart like Atlantis in my mouth.   This is a great place to dine in and take out. In fact, it's the perfect post work out meal. A healthy grilled dose of protein with some wheat bulgur (or rice) with a salad...it's perfect!  The wheat bulgur is cooked very well and accompanies every dish. The rice is seasoned and has a great texture.  Love this place, and will continue to come back. Very reasonably priced and awesome value for your buck.  Hate that I was greeted with a \"someone was giving reviews from the same IP address.\"  Won't lie though, they are that good!.",

Seemed like they were shocked that we asked. They only had two. Really? Then pretty much had to ice them up myself. 2. Added a $5.00 BYOB charge to the bill. Really?? 3. Said they didn't have enough silverware to give us clean ones after the appetizers. Really??? We were the only ones in the place!   Why it should have gotten 5 stars? Service:  1. After the initial debacle, the service was EXTREMELY attentive but not fake or annoying.  Food: 1. Appetizer cold plate was YUM! Especially the eggplant, dolmeh and tabouleh. Fried calamari, meh, tasted frozen, (I live on the coast and am used to the fresh stuff so I'm not going to be overly critical here). 2. Entrees: a. Several had chicken kabob and said they were outstanding, including cuz. b. Couple had lamb chops and said they were outstanding (including brother in law from Iran). c. Couple had shrimp, said they were tasty. d. Uncle, (from Afghanistan), had lamb kabob and I also ordered a side skewer. Medium rare perfection!!!  e. My main entree was a grilled whole dorado, OMG especially when eaten with the crispy skin! Rice was tasty too! f. Mom had eggplant parmesan and said it was too spicy. Hey it's a mediterranean restaurant, what do you expect?  Price: 1. Brunch with huge portions plus add ons for 11 people and just under $300.00? That's what Um talkin' 'bout!

    "text": "Food was quite good but the service was so bad that our dining experience could be described as mediocre, at best.  It took us 5-6 minutes just to get menus after sitting down AND I had to ask for them. There were several servers who walked by our table but didn't notice we were empty handed. This happened again as a new party of 2 sat down next to us - also without menus - and the server was surprised they hadn't yet ordered when they asked for menus.  They also forgot to bring the appetizers to the party next to us and ignored their empty entree plates for way too long. All of this made me lower my expectations for my own experience. Thankfully our food came without issue - the chicken saute and kebabs were both pretty good - but I had to remind for my Turkish tea (highly recommend) and water. The waiter also seemed surprised that he hadn't yet cleared our appetizer plates even though he had already brought our entrees. We ended with the baklava for dessert which was pretty tasty.  Throughout our entire meal, the hostess was on the phone taking takeout orders while the waiters were running around panicked. The staff here need more training, or the restaurant needs to be better staffed, especially on holidays.",

The appetizers were stand out with delicious lentil soup, smokey baba ganoush and tabouli.   We were a bit disappointed in our entrees. The falafel was dense, one side of the whole fish was overdone and the grilled lamb patty was flavorful but under salted.   The desserts were very good. In particular we enjoyed the Turkish delight with almonds.   This is a good and average-price downtown restaurant, but better middle eastern can be found elsewhere.",

Don't let the BYO fool you - the atmosphere inside is upscale. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and service was prompt. It's a great place for dinner before a show.  We started with the chef borek, stuffed grape leaves, and hummus. The borek is delicious - do not miss it! Obviously fried cheese in dough is going to be delicious, but the sauce really takes it to the next level. The grape leaves were good, but I was neither here nor there on the hummus (but I am super picky).  For my main dish I got the falafel. Initially I balked at the $17 price tag - usually being a vegetarian means I eat cheap. But when the dish arrived it was clear that it was worth the price. The falafel patties are quite large, and you get 5 of them, all on a giant salad.  Overall a great experience!",

The servers were friendly.  The restaurant is well-lit with white table cloth.  It's a great place to head out for a good dinner.  We got the chicken soup, the lamb shish kebab, and the iskender kebab.  All of them were outstanding.  The chicken soup has so much vegetable and meat, a bit too salty for me, but very warming.  I'd come get some if I ever feel under the weather.  The lamb shish kebab comes with standard turkish rice and salad.  The lamb was very juicy.  I preferred it over the lamb gyro on the iskender kebab.  Although the lamb gyro was more dry on the iskender kebab, the whole dish was drenched with tomato sauce.  The flavor was phenomenon.  The tangy yogurt on top help balance out the tomato sauce.  Great portion size, delicious taste - I'll be coming around more!",

    "text": "Yes.  Yes.  And Yes.  5 stars.  My dad, who lives in Missouri, said that the next time that he was in town that he wanted to have real Mediterranean food.  He and my mom were here over the weekend so we took them to Alihan's.  We went for lunch on Sunday.  There weren't very many patrons but I think it's because everyone was headed to the Pirate game.   My husband and I ordered Mixed Kabobs.  It has all of their meat and chicken choices for two people to share.  Needless to say that the platter was huge!!  I think we might have drooled a little.  It was definitely filled with meats along with two types of rice and side salads.  You almost didn't know where to start.  I started with the chicken and went from there.  Each meat was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly.  I couldn't stop eating the white rice and my husband chowed on the other reddish rice.  I'm not a big fan of rice but for some reason I loved this rice.  The salad gave you a nice crunch to go along with your meal.  I couldn't pick a favorite meat because they all had such different flavors.  We got my son's girlfriend to try lamb.  She is a majorly picky eater but really enjoyed the lamb.  That speaks volumes.   My mom had the Eggplant Parmesan.  I snuck a taste before she took her first bite.  WOW!  The eggplant isn't fried at all like it usually is at other places.  There were nice bites of mozzarella layered in as it was built almost like a lasagna.  The sauce was incredible.  It was very flavorful but not overpowering.  I thought my mom was going to actually lick the plate which is very unlike her.   My dad had the Shrimp and Seafood Ravioli.  I didn't taste the shrimp but I had one of the ravioli.  They are pillows of goodness covered in a rich creamy white sauce.  It is probably one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had.  Despite the heaping amount of food in one bite it still seemed light.  I actually wanted to take some of the sauce from my mom's dish and some from my dad's and mix them.  I think it would have made a third delicious sauce.   Our service was on point.  My parents LOVED their food.  They said it was one of the best meals that they have had.  I can't wait to take others there to try it.",

My mother and I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate and we chose the restaurant based on its close proximity to Heinz Hall.   We noticed a sign on the way in that offered a free glass of wine with an entree (we were pumped!), but we didn't realize that they didn't have a liquor license and they were BYOB, so we were quickly saddened after our first glasses were gone.  The rest of the evening would also hold a few more disappointments for us.  We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night, and they told us that they were already out of all their beef and filet mignon options (bummer!).  In addition, my mom ordered the salmon seafood ravioli and they brought her the shrimp seafood ravioli (however, not the end of the world).  The waitress was really great about it and brought out a piece of salmon for my mom to add to her pasta, but the salmon wasn't cooked all the way through and was actually cold in the middle.  On the bright side, the food tasted great! I ordered the calamari to start and the chicken shish kabob for my entree.  Both were excellent and very filling! My mom also still really enjoyed her shrimp/undercooked salmon ravioli.  The highlights of the evening were by far, however, our dessert (the Kunefe) and our waitress.  The dessert was unlike anything I've tried before (in a very good way), and our waitress was extremely accommodating and professional in dealing with the mistakes from the kitchen.  Considering this, I would probably choose to dine here again!",

The appetizers, entrees, and desserts are consistently high quality and it is clear that they make everything on site.  I have had my share of baklava and it is immediately obvious if someone makes it or buys it.  I can definitely say they make their own at the restaurant which is a sign of the level to which they take the food there.  So far we have tried the mixed grill which was wonderful, the mixed appetizer platter (which could be a wonderful meal in itself) and the iskender kabob which I am still daydreaming about.  Also, every time we have been there, there were many Turkish people there which is always a good sign for a turkish restaurant--if people who have eaten the cuisine all of their lives like it and go back, it must be pretty darn good.",

We missed brunch at Gastropub by a couple minutes after 2 on a Sunday and happened on Alihan's where we were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the hostess/server, Diana, and by the delicious and reasonably priced fresh Mediterranean Homemade Cuisine.  We started with freshly homemade delicious bread and a mixed cold platter which we three shared.  This was almost a full meal for the three and quite interesting and delicious.  Then we followed with a shared lamb shish kebab with bulgur, also interesting and tasty (the guys had the lamb though, not me.  But I had the bulgur, very good).  We fortunately decided to try the desert which I found out were also homemade like the bread.  These were such high quality, not too sweet and absolutely delicious!  We shared the baklava which was made with pistachios not walnuts, and the cannoli which was stuffed with a ricotta like creamy filling, so delicious.  Thank you Diana for making us welcome in our casual attire to your lovely restaurant!",

We ordered a wide variety of delicious appetizers (hummus, grape leaves, calamari, especially chef borek), in addition to the wonderful bread and oil with olive tapenade. We again ordered a wide variety of entrees, some based on the owners recommendations, like the dorado fish, lamb entrees, eggplant, chicken kebabs - all so tasty - accompanied by wheat bulgar ( rice is another option). The portions were a good size, and after bread & appetizers, some wisely decided to share entrees. Alihan's is BYOB, so we brought & they provided glasses and an ice bucket. A few brave souls ordered dessert, which they said were great, but I did not have any room for dessert.  This gem of a restaurant is located downtown. Looking forward to another trip to Pittsburgh so I can again eat at Alihan's!",

However, if you're a tabbouleh lover like me, you may want to choose something besides it-- the version we had was unfortunately slightly sweet, maybe from balsamic vinegar?!? Ive never met a tabbouleh with balsamic or other sweet-ish flavoring and never want to again. The Chef Borek was deep fried dough wrapped around some veggies and cheese - not very tasty or worth the deep fried calories. Fried calamari app was crisp and fine. The entrees were generous in size but our meats (gyro on Greek salad and lamb chop kabob) were disappointingly under-seasoned and bland. Shepherd salad was solid tho. For dessert we shared a rice pudding, which was creamy textured due to the rice grains being properly overcooked, but also bland, lacking spice, richness (not enough milk, cream or condensed milk?) and depth.",

We had a couple people in our group get the turkish coffee, and really enjoyed that too.  It's a little weird since it's inside a parking garage, but don't let that deter you. If you're looking for good Mediterranean food, this is a great option.",

We elected to go here before our Hamilton performance and was not disappointed in the least. The best way to start up is to enjoy a nice cup of Turkish tea, simply wonderful. All the appetizers we ordered were delicious, but the stand out was the Chef Borek. I have to say this was the best i've ever had, absolutely delicious. The pita was made warm and fresh as it was brought to our table with a serving of hummus. Calamari was tender and crunchy. Two of us had lamb dishes and our son had the fish. I can't say enough about how delicious the food was. It truly was a very good meal and we would go back again. Service was attentive and friendly. Score a seat by the window and people watch as you dine.",

The sea bass is tender and is paired with some spice sauce. Not sure exactly what the sauce was, but it was excellent. It comes with a pile of veggies. The veggies only taste okay, but since its not the main attraction of the dish, I will let that slide. I had a side of rice and the seasoning they used made the rice richer in flavor.  I would definitely recommend the sea bass dish. Its very flavorful and tender.",

It's right across the street from the Byham, so it's the perfect spot for a great meal before an event at the Cultural Trust.   Heads up! It's BYOB!! Don't forget your bottle or two of wine! And make a reservation! Although you can walk in too.   To start, we ordered the eggplant baba ganoush. It comes with pita bread. It's simply delicious.    While you wait for your meal - they bring you Turkish bread and oil to dip it in. The waitstaff is super friendly and helpful when your ordering.   For my meal, I ordered the chicken kebabs. They come over rice and a side salad. The chicken kebabs are a generous portion and great pieces of meat. The rice is very tasty as well. I usually don't eat the salad because I want to eat all my meat and rice.   My mom ordered the lamb kebabs- same deal as the the chicken. She enjoyed her meal as well.   We will back to Alihan's again soon!",

The decor was beautiful. It's a great place to take a business lunch or even a date. On your way in, check out the cooler in the back that has all of the Mediterranean desserts. You'll save room at the end! We went for lunch and hummus isn't on the lunch menu, but, we asked and they had no problem giving it to us. All of the lunch dishes were $11. Check out all of the pictures on this Yelp page to get an idea of what you can get. It's actually a really huge meal and we both took home leftovers. My friend couldn't stop commenting on how fresh all of the ingredients were. The food was perfection!  This is one of the best accidental finds that I've had recently! I'm definitely going to throw this one into my lunch rotation.",

We like Mediterranean food but had never eaten in a Turkish restaurant & weren't quite sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. White table cloths and a friendly reception told us we had made a good choice. After sharing a delicious \"Chef Borek\" appetizer of goat cheese & leeks baked in phyllo and served with a tomato marmalade, we each enjoyed grilled kabob-type dinners - one chicken & one lamb. The accompaniments (bulgur wheat and rice pilaf) were excellent. The meat was ground and did not actually come on a skewer. Tasty, but next time we will choose non-ground options. It's a BYOB place, but we were each offered (and gratefully accepted) one generous glass each of complimentary wine with our entrees. We enjoyed a dessert of baklava, along with Turkish tea and coffee. The staff was genuinely friendly and attentive. We will certainly go back - show or not!",

We were seated right away on the outdoor patio.  I would definitely put in reservations if I would go again or wanted to sit inside.  The waitress was so sweet and answered all of our questions.  A frequent visitor of the restaurant was sitting next to us and struck up a conversation.  He said that Alihan's gets all their meat from Amish farmers.  I believe it because it was so wonderful and fresh.  I forget the exact name of the dish that I had, but it was the shaved lamb.  It was so flavorful! The tea was also very lovely and had a nice refreshing taste.  The waitress had asked someone to refill our water and they forgot.  The waitress profusely apologize and brought us some complementary baklava.  It was so flaky and soft and was absolutely wonderful.  I can't wait to visit this establishment again!!!",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised!   I discovered Alihan's while visiting Pittsburgh for work, and walking around downtown looking for a good lunch spot.   I love Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine, and this place caught my eye.  As I got closer to the entrance, there was a lunch menu posted which incuded 6 lunch specials for $10 each.  There are several meat options to include chicken, lamb, beef, there is also a vegetarian option.  I opted for the Chicken Shish which was accompanied with my choice of wheat bulgur, fries or rice.  I opted for the bulgur.  My choice of soft drink was also included in the special. There was a longer wait for the food than I anticipated, maybe 20 minutes, but once the food arrived, I determined it was well worth the wait.   My meal consisted of 3 large chunks of grilled, well seasoned chicken, placed between 2 halves of delicious flatbread, with a side of shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and grilled bell pepper strips.   There was a generous portion of wheat bulgur, which was positively yummy.  I didn't know what to expect, whether the side dish would be hot, cold, seasoned etc.  The dish was served warm with an assortment of veggies and seasoned nicely.   The bulgur was great accompaniment to the other components of the meal.   There was also a side of house made tzatiki sauce.    This was a very good meal and a great value for just $10.  I would definitely return for lunch and would also like to try the more expansive dinner menu, as well.",

Dorado is also quite well-done as well.  They serve a wonderful homemade sort of pita bread served with olive oil and crush olives.    When we went, they unfortunately did not have some of the traditional turkish-style desserts so we will definitely have to go back. Turkish coffee is supposedly quite good from dining companions.  Some limitations of the place are the somewhat odd-ambience. Outside it's lively and busy, but the restaurant itself was somewhat dead on a weekend night. Surprising considering the quality of the food, which was excellent. Would definitely recommend. Reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are for the awkward, cheap use of paper table coverings over white tablecloth and slightly sluggish service. Quiet atmosphere and great food are enough to make up for these limitations, however.",

I loved the dill mixing with all the other flavors in the salad.  For desert, we shared the Kadayif which was a square of shredded phyllo dough with chopped walnuts and a dollop of cream on top.

As stated in other reviews here, everything on the menu here is extraordinary. Get the mezze platter as an appetizer and sample all their amazing tips and cold apps. And the kebabs and rice pudding were fantastic. But if I was going to pick one thing on the menu, The crushed lentil soup Is by leaps and bounds the best lentil soup I have had in my life.

I had Lamb kebab which was very juicy and tasty. You must try Turkish tea which adds more flavor to your stomach. It'll help digest food too.  I'll for sure go there and recommend it to anyone who wants to have different and new cuisine to try for a change.",

Alihan, the owner is always there making sure everything is tip-top. The interior is very modern, everything is very clean! They have beautiful silverware and other things that are gorgeous hand made and shipped from Turkey. Alex is awesome, and Alihan's girlfriend who works there as manager  is so nice!  We dined there 4 times within 3 days we stayed in Pittsburgh , one day we had 2 dinners there ) and everything was consistently great!  Did I mention that the prices are very reasonable ? Dinner for two under $50 with drinks and dessert!",

The patio was all utilitarian, metal table and chairs, like being in a different place, like many euro places I've been to.  so you could choose how \"formal\" you wanted to be.   The menu is extensive, a nice mix of Turkish, italian influenced , fresh fish etc..... i settled on the grilled eggplant appetizer, a Caprice salad with Lamb Gyros, and the Knefe, with turkish tea for desert.   the staff was nice, relaxed,  and there if you needed them.  Take your time, enjoy what Alihan's has to offer. Good food, ambiance, and staff.",

They are centrally located right under a parking garage and make it so easy to get in and out. The food was delicious and plentiful. Get some baklava to eat at home too!",

As we were a group we started with some orders of hummus and labne and were delighted by the delicious Turkish bread! Every single entree was incredible. I myself had the shrimp and ravioli. Some in my party had big salads. Our server was easy going, kind, and made good recommendations. When the bill came we were surprised that it wasn't much over $100 for such a great evening with 6 adults.  You can bring your own alcohol, which we did not know. However each person was offered a complimentary glass of wine (red or white), and that was just what we needed to accompany the meal.",

It's tough to find a healthy option for delivery around here and my go to Chinese place was already closed for the evening, so this is a pretty big deal. Alihan's did not disappoint!   The gentleman that answered the phone was friendly, as was the delivery driver. We tried the mixed kebab dinner and the white bean salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The lamb chop kebab was especially good, I'll get the full order for my meal next time! I loved the wheat bulger, my husband was a fan of the white rice. We both agreed that the bread was fantastic. Overall, I'm impressed and we'll definitely order again!",

For dessert I went with the baklawa which was above average. I guess I'm comparing it to the Chicago baklawa quality which I am accustomed to. Location wise it is in a prime area and will always attract business. Next time if I'm there perhaps I'll try the chicken entrees.",
