The last time I was in they had Deschutes Fresh Squeezed, Sweetwater 420, Dogfish 60 minute, Stone IPA and Founders porter all on draft. Pretty awesome, but they were only $5 a pint! Which is impressive for the quality beer.   They are well known for their wings, but I got the Cuban Reuben sandwich. Combining two of my favorites, and it didn't disappoint. Piled high with pork and pastrami, topped with swiss and a mustard slaw that gave it just enough sauce. The service was great, too. Whenever I would finish or get close on a beer Emily or Alex would ask if I wanted another one. Great place, fairly priced with an above average selection.",

I'd like to watch my team here but unfortunately can't. Besides that, they have a great beer selection and great food. The happy hour deals are fantastic and they pour a great mixed drink. It's tough to get a seat at the bar on a Friday night but probably because it's one of the few very good places in the area. I'll be back just not on a Sunday :)",

A bar area separate from a dining area, separate from an event room, separate from a bottle shop (with an excellent selection, by the way).

Hal's is expanding and because of this I think they've stepped up their game.  The first time we went we got the fish tacos and the spinach artichoke dip.  We again got the fish tacos, but this time shared a steak salad as well.   The fish tacos were much much better and I will now be craving them.  Big fresh chunks of fish, fresh veggies, warm tortilla, and a spicy mayo.   The waitress was better and the beer selection is still the best in the North Hills.   The food could still be stepped up and a little more creative and the noise could be addressed during dinner hours, but Hal's is a good option.",

Its a small place, dark in atmosphere, mostly a sports bar but also a place where you can make reservations to sit down and eat. I usually come here to start the night and watch the Pens or Pitt games before heading out for the night. Its a good place to watch a game, has lots of nice flat screen TV's.  Their food menu is pretty bar generic with good wings, a hefty build your own burger, pizza, and they do have some steaks, calamari, and roast beef type stuff on their dinner menu if you want a heartier meal. I really come here though to suck down the Garlic Parmesan wings. Probably the 2nd best wing I have had in my many wing travels. I usually prefer hot wings but their hot wings just consist of Franks Red Hot Sauce which is kind of generic for me, but the Garlic Parmesan are out of this world. Trust me, you'll want to lick the drippings out of your dish after eating them.  There are about 8 beers on draft, mostly the basics, but they have a wide range of bottles to choose from. Also they have a ton of liquor if that's your thing. I've had some really strong drinks made here, mostly around 5$ for a mix drink and I wasn't complaining due to how nicely made they were.   I was here last Saturday with a group of about 8 people who made reservations for 7:30 and the place was still pretty packed around midnight when we all left. I've never really had bad service here at all, and especially this night when it was pretty crowded and with such a big party we were all satisfied with how fast our drinks were filled and how good the food tasted.   Hal is usually the big tall guy standing at the end of the bar kinda watching over things. He's a good guy.",

Definitely stop in here if you are a beer snob, or if you are just looking to try something different.

He suggested Hal's today for us while we were running North Hills errands & I was game especially after reading Yelp reviews raving about their great beer and bar food selections.  Our bartender gave us a warm greeting & we discovered Stone was their only IPA on tap. Only a few taps here, so the great beer selection clearly comes mainly in bottles. The bar is nicely appointed & also a bit dark - black ceilings & walls - I needed the light on my phone to read the menu in the afternoon.   Menu is bar food basic & not super extensive. I ordered the pulled pork with onion rings & hubby got a build your own burger (which excited him) & onion rings. And these sandwiches were really good! The burger was gigantic & I heard happy noises next to me. My pulled pork was delicious with a perfect amount of barbecue sauce. My ciabatta roll was good but a bit too much bread, so after eating 1/4 of it as a sandwich, I forked the remainder. Onion rings were good, not amazing.   Service impressed when we said we'd split 1 last beer & our bartender drew 2 glasses she filled 3/4 full! Pleasant surprise on the bill that the Stone IPAs were $5 when it's pretty pricey by the case to buy.   Overall this is a nice bar to grab some bar food & a beer.",

    "text": "We've been trying to get to Hal's for quite some time, but it's usually met with a long wait. We finally made it after technical difficulties at two other restaurants forced us into Plan C! Luckily, on this trip, we had no wait.  Mr. J described the interior atmosphere as \"cavernous\". Which is pretty spot on since it's very dark and very loud. Hal's could definitely benefit from some acoustical tiles on the ceiling to buffer some of the noise. I would have preferred to sit on the patio with the fire pits and heat lamps, but it was another rainy evening in Pittsburgh.  The beer selection is vast and there is something to suit every taste from imports to craft brews. There are also about 6-8 beers on tap. Equally nice is the bottleshop next door so that you can grab a 6-pack to go.  Mr. J was craving a hamburger and had a hard time finding the one and only burger on the menu (BYOB (build your own burger) - under sandwiches). I chose the ribs,  but had hopes dashed when the server said they were out of ribs. (Seriously?!) I had to make a quick decision and went with the BYOB, sweet potato fries, and fried pickles.  The fried pickles were good - spears served with a mild horseradish sauce. This was probably the best thing I ate. The burger was your standard frozen patty on a dry-as-a-week-old Kaiser bun. I think the bun may have been toasted, but was so pale in color, I could only speculate. The top bun was also broken in half due to the dryness. Ketchup and mustard were served on the side (annoying) and the pickles were chopped up dill pickle spears. My sweet potato fries were typical Sysco/US Foods frozen/coated fries.  Perhaps their dinner entrees are more house-made, but I wasn't able to find out. Hal's is another place where the 5-star reviews threw me off my game. I wasn't as impressed as most; but for two beers, an appetizer, and burgers under $40, I can't complain too much.  Additionally, I realize this may be a sports bar, but it's rather awkward when the servers are wearing yoga pants and tank tops like they've just come from the gym.",

The staff is first-rate, the food is consistently good, and management makes sure things stay that way without appearing to over-manage.  Its got a very good feel to it.  The menu could use a refresh more often, but if all else fails, order the wings.  They're always great.  Terrific mixed drinks, the draft beer selection is reasonabe, and you'd be hard pressed to ask for a bottled beer they don't have.    Someone else mentioned the noise level in another review.  They are right.  I have an app that measures decibel levels, and on a recent wing night it was measuring somewhere between standing next to a lawnmower and an airplane.  Too loud to talk and way too loud to work there 6-8 hours a day.   Other than that, I can't recommend this place enough...",

The bar had about 15 people there, plus more at adjacent tables.  I sat down and it took a good 10 minutes for someone to take my drink order.  I ordered a Yuengling draft which tasted great.  You can tell they clean their lines which is a huge plus in my book.          I then proceeded to order a to go order of wings and a chicken salad.  The salad order was for my wife who was going to work that night. I specifically requested the chicken on the side so she could heat it up later.           The wait for the food is my only complaint.  I ordered another beer and waited for my food.  I saw a food runner putting multiple to-go orders in bags and placing them at the bar to await pick up.  I watched this individual place multiple to-go bags on the bar.  My order was placed on the bar (without my knowledge).  I sat at the bar for about 25 minutes until a bartender noticed my to-go order and brought it to me. I paid my tab and left the establishment.           When I got home my wings were cold and I had to heat them in the oven before eating them.  The chicken salad also had the chicken on the salad and not on the side as I had requested.           This is a great bar with a great atmosphere, but the service definitely needs improvement.",

I ordered steamed broccoli and the first time it came out with my entree it was swimming in butter. I kid you not, it looked like they melted a whole stick of butter in a bowl and stuck some broccoli in there. By the time I got my corrected order everyone was about done with their food. I got the fish tacos as the main dish, poor decision. Hardest fish I've ever has. I questioned if it was chicken because it was so tough and overdone. Lastly, my friend stopped me from eating my last taco because their was a crawling bug underneath it.   So unappetizing, what a bummer.",

    "text": "My BF and I stopped here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  We arrived around 5:30 and were seated right away.  The dining area isn't very large and within 15 minutes, there was a wait to be seated. (Warning: The entire place is very dark and it is difficult to read the menu without glasses and/or a flashlight.)    The menu has a lot of great options:  sandwiches, salads, entrees, pizza and a BYOB (build your own burger) option.  I went with the half chicken entree and BF went with the Pierogie appetizer, Wings and a house salad.  My chicken entree was delicious. The portion was large and the rub on the chicken was just spicy enough. The chicken was moist and tender.  The side of broccoli was steamed perfectly.  My only complaint is that the entrees do not come with a salad.  It's $1 extra if you want a salad.  My BF really enjoyed the house salad, since all ingredients were chopped.  The wings were a nice size and the BBQ sauce was sweet, not at all spicy.  The pierogie appetizer was a little disappointing.  They were hard, chewy and smothered in a congealed cheese.  We were hoping for some butter and onion.  We would not order them  again.    The prices are pretty reasonable ($8-10 for sandwiches and $14-$20 for entrees). The place does get rather loud since there isn't any separation between the dining area and the bar.    Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and would definitely stop in again.",

    "text": "I always love to check out places that offer the promise of great bar food and a huge beer selection. And so when we were in the area I knew I had to stop and give Hal's a try. Reading many of the Yelp reviews I knew I'd find some things I'd like. And I did!  To be honest, we went there for a late lunch on a Saturday and to have some beer. So my first priority was food. While the menu is limited it does have a few interesting items. I wasn't interested in the dinner entree portion and the sandwich options aren't overly plentiful, we were both able to choose something we liked. The build your own burger was really good and cooked to perfection. The accompanying onion rings were just ok - typical of any frozen rings you'd get in most bars. Not like James Street Gastropub which has outrageous onion rings - just saying. My wife's pulled pork was tasty and is something I'd recommend.  The beer selection is huge (I estimated about 70 different kinds!) but regrettably, the draft selection is limited. I love craft beer but want to drink it on tap not out of a bottle. I can do that at home. Only one IPA on tap (not acceptable) but they did have a few Belgians available. I would love to see more support for some of the local craft brewers here. How about some Helltown or East End or even Penn Brewing? But the Stone IPA is always acceptable.  Atmosphere is typical sports bar motif - about 15 flat screens around the bar all with sports on - it WAS a Saturday after all. We sat at the bar and the first thing that struck us was how DARK it was. We're talking dungeon here folks. I mean dark! Black walls, black ceiling, black bar back....Black. If you're in that familiar physical condition where the very presence of any light causes your head to resume that painful throbbing then this place is just for you. You'll love it here. But me? I wanted to read the menu. And couldn't. Had to use my iPhone light to even make out that there was writing on that menu!  Service was ok - usually I sit at the bar to improve my chances of getting better service and to keep my beer refilled more easily. This wasn't the best but it wasn't anything I could fault them on.  I won't go out of my way to go back here but I will consider a return visit when I'm in the area.",

It was a seat yourself atmosphere and a waitress showed up quickly. We each ordered a beer from their decent selection and the Guacamole and Bruschetta appetizer. Everything was brought out quickly and the appetizer was very good! We asked the waitress if we could switch our bill to outside and it was no problem at all. We ordered another beer and ventured outside to the fire pit for a bit. The crowd was very relaxed and laid back. We decided to checkout the attached 6-pack shop and I was impressed with their selection of single bottles. They even had some of my hometown favorite Hoppin' Frog beer which I haven't been able to find anywhere else in PA. There is a Rare Beer Club that I got some info on too. The staff was very helpful and attentive to our needs. I will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "I wanted to like Hal's, but unfortunately, my last two experiences were disappointing.  I have to say the bar food is not good.  We ordered nachos that were cold and soggy, and the pepperoni rolls were made of that store bought dough, which was given to us raw inside. At first we thought it was the mozzarella so we ate it but it was raw dough - very raw.  Some of the service is also unprofessional at Hal's and they seem to run the show there.  We sat in the back once and watched as they locked a girl out while she was banging on the door to get back in.  It was really distracting because of our seat in the back.  Then, recently, our waitress sat with friends chatting during her shift.  The place reminds me of a college bar instead of a nicer gastropub.",

Really no complaints. Only gave 4 instead of 5 stars because not a lot of options for entrees that interest me, especially considering I come here a ton. The wings are very very good, on par with sidelines if not better, but I'd love more entree options. Still, it's the best bar in the neighborhood to me.",

Good specialty drink options and the food is usually plentiful and good. Really loved the Jalepeno Ranch Chips.  Addictive and a lot for your order. Homemade dressings are good quality. I got the steak salad and asked for blue cheese over cheddar and boy did I get it. Actually removed some because it was so plentiful. Hubby's ribs were very tender and meaty. The broccoli was a little over done. But worth the trip back to try more items.",

    "text": "Hal's was on my Bookmarked list. I had heard great things about the food. I was in the area and decided to give it a try. When we pulled in the place looked fun and happy. The outdoor seating area had lights all around and gave Hal's a welcoming look. I wish it had been warm enough to sit outdoors. The inside was just as welcoming. It was painted with warm colors and the lights were low. We were seated quickly. They have an extensive beer list. They also have a bottle shop next door. If you are a beer connoisseur, this is a great place to try.  We ordered the Cuban Rueben with onion rings and a pizza with bacon, onions, and black olives. It didn't take long for our food to come which was nice since we were starving. Hands down the Cuban Reuben is one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. It is a Reuben but has pulled pork on it. The pork enhances the other flavors of a Reuben-especially the brown mustard. The portions of items on the sandwich were perfect. Sometimes places get heavy handed with sauerkraut and it is the only flavor you get. That is definitely not the case here. The onion rings were large and crunchy. They give you a hearty portion of them.  The pizza was a lot bigger than we expected. It was literally covered with toppings. They are very generous with them. The crust is not a thin crust but leans toward a crunch. The bacon was actually a light flavor and married well with their pizza sauce.  The restaurant was clean and our server was very nice. We will definitely be going back.",

Once we were seated, the service was very good and didn't seem slowed down by the amount of guests in the restaurant.  The wings were very tasty, and they have a lot of interesting and unique flavors - like Fiery raspberry and chipotle Cinnamon - both of which were surprisingly good.   The second time I was there was on a Sunday -late afternoon- and it was pretty empty when we got there.  Our waitress was very attentive, but not in an annoying way, and extremely friendly.  It did seem to take awhile for a waitress to notice when new people arrived and needed to be seated.  The sweet potato fries were excellent, and I enjoyed their pulled pork sandwich.  The prices are fair and you get a decent amount of food.  The beer selection is excellent.",

    "text": "I have visited Hal's Bottle Shop twice with friends who come here probably bi-weekly. The first time, I had unfortunately done a good bit of drinking already at Grist House, so the experience was slightly blurry. :) We ordered Fried Pretzels, Wings (Bourbon Sriracha, I believe), and a BYOP (Build Your Own Pizza). The food was all really tasty, and I enjoyed finally trying my friend's favorite beer (Sofie). Thankfully, I was completely sober for my second Hal's visit. We came on Taco Tuesday, so I got to enjoy $1 hard tacos. These tacos are almost a comfort food as they reminded me of eating homemade hard tacos that my mom would make as an easy dinner in the early '90s. These tacos are about as basic as they come but oh-so-good at the same time. Danny was working in the Bottle Shop both times that I've been here and made great recommendations for beer for my friend (who happens to have an almost identical beer palette to my own). Though Hal's is not necessarily a place I'd hunt out and return to on my own, I'd definitely enjoy coming back with my friends.",

    "text": "I've been here on several occasions and nearly every time I've been completely disappointed. I once ordered a steak. Overcooked by at least two temps (ordered medium-rare, got medium well/well done) and it had absolutely no seasoning.  Last night I ordered the Parmesan-garlic wings and they were literally buffalo sauce with some Parmesan cheese grated on top. Just bad.  I did have a lobster Mac n cheese here once that was pretty good, but it is no longer on the menu. Go figure...  The service is decent but most of the servers have no clue of what's on the menu, how it's prepared or what alcohols or beers they have at the bar, which can be pretty frustrating.  My fiance and her family like the food though, so I continue to tag along and suffer through it.   As a bar, Hal's is a large sports bar/restaurant and it gets so loud that you have to scream at the person across the table from you. If you're looking for good food and conversation in a casual, relaxed atmosphere, there are plenty of better places in the area.",

    "text": "On a stretch of dead space on Babcock Blvd, Hal's definitely delivers. My Girlfriend and I met some friends here for an NCAA basketball game on a Thursday night. Immediately you are welcomed by a friendly and inviting open space, the bar to restaurant ratio is about 50/50 with no wall separating the two. Neither one over powers the other and I wouldn't feel weird bringing children here at all.      The beer selection is very good, as you would expect with a 6 pack shop attached to the other side of the restaurant, liquor is pretty typical of what you would find at most chain restaurants that have full bars. The service was very friendly and helpful.      The only average part of the experience was the food. It's definitely not bad, just nothing to write home about. We had the Salt and Pepper Calamari, which was a tad rubbery but not so much that it ruined the dish, I found it to be a little salty also, but my GF didn't seem to mind. The chicken wings were very good. We mixed dry rub and wet sauces and they were the stars of the show, crispy and juicy. The meatloaf cupcakes were just ok. They had good flavor, but very dense and the mash potatoes were kind of pasty, possibly from not adding enough cream or butter. I absolutely Loved the Sweet Potato fries, some of the best that I've had.     After we ate our dinner the staff noticed that our group was concentrating intently on our Basketball game and offered us a private room with 3 TVs and couches which was very cool.     Overall, I would recommend Hal's. It seemed to attract a large happy hour crowd, which I assume is contributed to the lack of competition in the area. The food is about what you would expect at an Applebee's or TGIF. It won't disappoint, but won't blow you away either.",

I'll probably be back for the martinis and may try something else off the menu.",

Hal has a knack for hiring talented and attentive employees. His staff is kind, it knows the menu, and it does a wonderful job of servicing customers. It is obvious that Hal cares a great deal about his business because he is almost always there.   The food is consistently above average, especially for bar food. The prices are reasonable, the portion sizes are large, and the taste is delicious. The best menu items include the nachos (I like subbing chicken for the ground meat and moving the cheese sauce to the side), the turkey chipotle sandwich (the bread is delicious and the lunch meat is of high quality), the BBQ quesadilla (uniquely excellent) and any of the salads (they are big, filling, and fresh). The drink selection is big enough and the prices are affordable.   Hal's is also a great place to watch a sporting event, especially a Penguins game. It has a loyal following that fills the place for big events and there are plenty of TVs to see the action.   One area Hal can improve is the lighting inside of his bar. Hal's is a great space, but it is a bit dark inside. Additional lighting would brighten his bar and make an already awesome place even better.   Lastly, Hal goes out of his way to make sure his customers' experience is a positive one. No restaurant is perfect but Hal goes above and beyond to fix anything that may not be to the customer's standard.",

When I finished placing the order for 3 dozen wings, she told me the order totaled more than $40.  I mentioned the price difference and she said that was the \"old menu\".  I pointed out that this pricing was on the website, and that she should honor it.   I was shocked that she refused to honor the pricing on the website even though it doesn't take much to update a few numbers on the webpage that's already online.  She forced me to decide to cancel the order or accept the significant price difference.  Stuck between a rock and hard place, embarrassed and unhappy - I accepted the increase, and promptly posted online.  I emailed the restaurant to let them know my dissatisfaction, and will update this review based on their response.   TL/DR: I was forced to pay 30% more than their website advertised for wings because they raised prices and never bothered updating.",

I've also had the Seiten and it's delicious, as is the tuna appetizer, though more was a bit would rock.  One thing I'm not a fan of is the acoustics. When it's busy, it's extremely loud, especially in the dining area. I also find that no matter which shoes I wear, I slip on the floor to the ladies room, regardless if I've had drinks or not.  I will always come back to Hals. It feels good, and the drinks are great. It's a quality local bar",

    "text": "This was the third time my husband and I went to Hal's. The service was good, we went around 5:30pm so it wasn't busy yet and our server was very attentive. However the food was pretty disappointing. We got the nachos with chicken as an appetizer and they were so coated with nacho cheese that we had to scrap most of it off because they were practically inedible. They reminded us of bad bowling ally nachos but they were $10! For dinner my husband got the chicken sandwich which was okay, the sauce he got on it was pretty good. I got the Margherita flatbread (which I usually order at other restaurants) and it was just okay as well. It didn't have a lot of flavor. Not sure if we will be back anytime soon. Hal's nice in the summer to sit at the outside tables and that way you don't leave smelling like fried food. Maybe some things on the menu are good but definitely not everything. I just felt like our meal was not worth the $50 we spent.",

Just from pulling up I knew I was going to love the place based on the way it is setup.  It has a really cool looking outdoor patio area, with plenty of seating.  The inside was very nice too, very clean and modern looking.  On top of the great atmosphere, our service from start to finish was great!  For my meal I went with the grilled buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  Juicy and tender.  The buffalo sauce on the sandwich had a great flavor and paired really well with their ranch, which I got on the side.  The fries were also delicious.  Everyone in my group loves their meals.  I had some of my wife's Chipotle Turkey Club and would highly recommend this as well.  The menu at Hal's is so diverse and has so many options.  I can't wait to come back and try some of the other meals.",

    "text": "I visited Hal's with some friends last Friday evening. We didn't have a reservation and were able to get a table easily around 7:30 pm. Our server was friendly and patient as we navigated around the large menu to figure out what we wanted. We all started off with a beer- it is connected to a bottle shop of course! I went with Goose Island Sophie, which was quite delicious. For food, here is everything we tried and my review of the item:  -Crispy Seitan ($7) with honey sriracha/ fiery raspberry sauces: Really tasty! It did taste a little gummy, but the coating on the outside was super good and crispy, making them delicious. Both sauces are super hot, so be mindful of that! -Fried Pickles ($7): Perfectly fried, and loads of flavor. I didn't love the horseradish sauce they were served with, so I went with ranch dressing instead.  -Spicy Parmesan Garlic Poppers ($9): Def. spicy and def. unique, but also def. not worth $9 for the portion. Wouldn't order these again.  -Wings (6 for $6.50) with sweet chili sauce: Really good wings. Juicy, big, and packed with flavor. This sauce was my favorite out of all of the ones I tried.  -House Salad ($4) with lemon vin: Very large portion! I was impressed with how fresh the salad was- something I didn't expect from a place that specializes in bar food. I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it! -Fried Chicken Salad ($12) with ranch: Also HUGE, fresh, and very good!  Overall, we had a great time and would come back again. Would be a great place to watch a game, and the outdoor area looks like it was would be a really relaxing place to hang out at during the warmer months!",

    "text": "First, the positive stuff. Our server was very friendly. My wife really enjoyed their wings. I had a burrito which was just alright, but it met my expectations.  My main issue with Hal's is the passive aggressive attitude the kitchen obviously has. We ordered pepperoni rolls since others online had said they were excellent. Initially, they came out almost raw and were VERY doughy/under-cooked. The server was very understanding and returned them to the kitchen.   The second time they came out, they were burned to a crisp. Again, our server was very friendly and immediately agreed the new rolls were outright burned. She removed them from our final bill, but the overall experience left a very bad taste in my mouth.  At its best, Hal's was an underwhelming experience. There are tons of sports bar/pub grub places in the area. The poor attitude of a kitchen not owning up to their mistake makes me never want to give Hal's another penny.",

I was curious about the onion rings, which were quite brown, however they turned out crispy and delicious, not the least bit soggy.

I've tried a number of things here over the years - the dinner entrees are fantastic. Pork osso bucco, burgers, half chicken, ribs, risotto - these are all great options that are sure to please. But typically I stick with the apps menu. Frankly, Hal's has the best wings in the North Hills (by far). I highly recommend their more unique flavor offerings - Fiery Raspberry, Smoked Habanero BBQ, Bourbon Sriracha, Cinnamon Chipotle. Also be sure to try the pepperoni rolls.

Every time we order something she had to remind us of the \"extra\" charges. Tonight was the first time in 10+ years we have never tipped  20+% to our wait staff. Since we were pre judge and treated less I have a more important tip to leave now. First impressions is everything and you never know if we will be the ones to give  or deny you your next opportunity! We official have a bad taste in our mouths and will not be back!",

I come into the Pittsburgh area 3-4 times per month and occasionally stop in this establishment for a few beers and get take out.  It's a good idea to ask for another beer when your current one is half full for if you wait till its empty you will wait forever.  I regards to takeout, my food sat in my line of sight of over 20 minutes until someone came over and asked if I needed another beer.  I declined and said I was waiting on my order...then they went to where it was sitting and brought it over.  I asked for it to be remade since it was already going to be cold and the barmaid gave me attitude.  I am done with this place.  Good luck Hal.",

The owner is a great guy, he actually cares about his customers and goes above and beyond to make people happy.

The waitresses/bartenders are both good looking and are actually good at what they do, which is a rare package anymore.

    "text": "Ok, so Hal's has decent bar food, decent atmosphere and a decent beer selection. That's where it ends. First, the service is abysmal. We walked in at 7 P.M. on Wednesday night and stood at the front for 15 minutes before anyone came and got our name for a table. The girl walked up and said \"have you been helped?\", I said \"no\", She said What's your name and how many?\", I said \"Greg, 2\" and she says \"ok, thanks\" and walks away, not to be seen again. No time frame, no nothing. Second, we went to grab a drink at the bar while we were waiting, stood at the bar for 10 minutes before anyone appeared, stood there another 10 minutes before that person found the time to take our order, and was just all around rude. Finally, after an hour wait, we got seated. After the waitress saw we already had drinks, she continued on about her business as if we were good without even asking. We saw her a total of 4 times, once when we were seated, once after we got our food to see how it was and finally to drop off and pick up the check. Management needs to do some serious training on their waitstaff. I was a server for many years and the most important rule is to never blame your bad service on being busy. There are no excuses for this level of bad. By the way, this is the 2nd bad experience I've had with the service here, so its not just a fluke. Train your servers and you have a great little place, continue to allow it and you'll rapidly lose customers.",

    "text": "First visit to Hal's tonight. Started with 6 garlic parmesan style wings. The wings were excellent - the sauce had some bite, the parm was freshly grated over top and there was enough garlic to clear your sinuses, which is how I like them. They were served with ranch dressing and some celery sticks. Very tasty.  My entree was a half-rack of St. Louis style ribs, and I selected mac-n-cheese for my side. It also came with broccoli. The broccoli was very nice - only the florets, no stems, done perfectly.  The mac-n-cheese was pretty good. The elbow mac might have been a little overcooked but the sauce was creamy and thick.   Now to the ribs. The serving was large for a half-rack but the only word I can think of to describe them was \"soggy\". The meat tasted fine, the BBQ sauce was nice, thick and tangy but the ribs had no crust and the texture of the meat was like a pot roast..  I will be the first to admit that might be exactly how they were meant to be, and maybe that's what their clientele likes - it just wasn't what I was used to. I like a little bark on ribs.  For dessert I tried Fried Oreos with ice cream and whipped cream. The ice cream might have been a second-tier brand.  Texture was OK but the flavor was too faint.  The service was good, we had our glasses refilled promptly without asking and our server was friendly and attentive. I would describe the atmosphere as LOUD. One of the loudest restaurants I have ever been in. The layout is one large room, with metal ceilings, brick walls and a hard floor so there is nothing to absorb any sound.   My experience merits another visit as there were a large number of menu items I was interested in - fresh spinach salad with bacon dressing, ribeye, quesadillas, Cuban style pulled pork sandwich and others. I might try a slower night like a Monday or Tuesday to see if it's not as loud.",

So I decided to check out a few other spots from my google search - struck out 3 times before realizing I was in the right place to begin with!  (Apparently many bars in the area can still allow smoking Hal's does not!) ... So I went back, and had a great night.

The \"good\" beer such as the Belgian is obviously a little pricey, but if you're looking for Miller Light or something of that sort, there's always some kind of special going on.  The downsides are that the parking sucks on Friday and Saturday nights and the bar can get a bit crowded as there is limited seating.  My friends and I absolutely LOVE the private room and try to get it as much as possible when we're making plans to hang out.  All you have to do is call ahead and see if it's available.  There are no minimums or requirements to use the room, but I know my friends and I always make it worthwile for them to put us in there.  It fits about 10 people comfortably at most, but it has a TV, couches and chairs.  It used to even have a Wii, but I'm guessing that some jerk broke it because they don't have one anymore.  It's like having a small party in your living room except you don't have to clean up after the party's over.  Hal himself is a nice guy who is almost always there and will go out of his way to accomodate you.",

Can't find a place to park and I feel weird parking next to the other businesses. 2) Too many people on busy nights that you can't get a drink. Not a bad thing, it's just would be nice not have to wait a while to get a refill. I don't mind waiting; it's just a pain sometimes. Too thirsty!!!",

    "text": "We've been going to Hal's the 3 years we've lived here.  Honestly, never had a bad meal. Not even when they are packed because there's a game on.  The parking lot can get a little interesting but only because there are next door to a billiard room.    They have a well rounded menu from chicken wings to risotto!  Truly my 1 and only dislike is the sausage they use on their pizza.  I'm from Chicago and it's not what I consider a pizza sausage, it's more like kielbasa (which might be ok for a Yinzer, but I didn't like it) - other than that their pizza is good and HUGE and in-expensive.    I've met Hal several times as he often delivers the food himself.  Great guy and family man.  Wide array of liquor to chose from and usually a sports game on TV if you are into that.  Give it a try, I think it will be worth the trip.  Whenever someone new moves to town we take them to Hal's and we haven't heard one complaint yet!",

Wings are fantastic and worth the wait.  They are always fresh and never the frozen kind.  Thursday is another great night because next door they have a bottle shop with beer tastings of various craft breweries.....some you know of and others that are new or never heard.  Plus on that same night is $3 drafts in the bottle shop too.  Dan the bottle shop manager is very attentive and will recommend beers for you if unsure of what to get.  During the summer they have an outdoor seating area too.  Hal's overall is a great place to go for food and friends.",

    "text": "Never got seated. We stood first in line for 15 minutes as waitresses and hostesses zipped passed us as though we were invisible. We left for a second and when we came back another couple was first in line. They waived to a waitress and got seated immediately. We waited longer and there were tables available but not cleaned off. When the hostess finally came to us she took our name and said we would have to wait as there were several people ahead of us. That is ironic since the couple that was seated immediately before us did not have to wait for a table and did not have reservations. They were making no attempt to clean off the other tables available and seat anyone which we could not understand. When asked if we called ahead they said, \"Oh there is only one couple in front of you.\" So why were the tables not cleaned off and that waiting couple who supposedly called ahead seated by now? We left this restaurant totally annoyed and irritated by their lack of common decency.   We went to Kretzers down the street from Hals and had a wonderful dinner. The hostess was gracious, the waitresses were extremely efficient and friendly, and the dinner was delicious. So, unless you know someone at Hals do not expect to be seated, as it is obvious they only cater to the ones who come there regularly. We often go out for dinner and thought it would be nice to try Hals for a change.    We will never go back there.",

    "text": "First the good--The food at Hal's is outstanding--love love love the food!  It's delicious and they give you really nice portions.  The pepperoni rolls are soooo good and the Italian hoagie, meatloaf cupcakes and strawberry chicken salad are all amazing!  It's a cool atmosphere and the outdoor seating area is lovely!  The servers are all young and sweet.      However, the service leaves a lot to be desired.   I should say, I have been there with just my husband and we were served quickly, got our food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time but every single time I have gone with a group (or 6 or larger), the service is seriously lacking.   It takes forever to get refills or more beers/drinks, etc. and our food took so long to come out. In fact, our waitress was MIA so long that we wrote our orders down and handed it to her once we finally caught sight of her again.   She was running around like crazy so maybe someone called off or they were short handed so not her fault but I think the management should step up and help out or DO SOMETHING!  Or even if she explained what was going on, that would have been appreciated.  The saving grace is that the food is fantastic but I'm not so sure it's worth the wait any longer.   I may be back for drinks or if I go with a group, maybe we should ask to be seated in groups of four to up our chances of getting out of there in less than 2 hours! And I would never chance going there for dinner if we had plans after (like a movie or concert because chances are we would miss most of it!) I think I may just go to Rum Runners or Seibs in the meantime if I have the choice again.  Or until the service has improved.  Unfortunately, many of my friends have had the same experience as well.",

The interior is well designed and showcases a fantastic bar fully stocked with 8 craft beers on tap and a huge selection of bottles.   Everything that I have eaten at Hal's has been fantastic (BBQ Pork Quesadilla, Fish Sandwich, Soft Pretzels, Fried Pickles, Wings, etc.) The menu is comprised of your standard bar fare, however, its all prepared with a moderate twist which makes it unique. All of the food is very reasonably priced ($8-11) and they have a daily special most days of the week. $1 Taco Tuesdays, $.45 Wing Wednesday, $2 Slider Thursdays.   My only beef with Hal's is that it is too damn dark in there! Turn the lights up a bit, no one likes to use their phone to read the menu.",

    "text": "North Hills Secret!  I went here after a Pirates game with some friends.  There was also a penguin game that night as well.  The parking lot made it look like the place was elbow to elbow.  Once inside we realized everyone must have driven their own car.  There was plenty of room.    We got a table and there were even seats at the bar.  We were greated by a very friendly waitress who got us drinks and menus.  We ordered your typical bar food, wings, fried pickles, and french fries.  The food was great.  We got these garlic parmesan wings that were fantastic!  I would have to say that some might find the french fries a little salty but I thought they were delicious.  They also have a very large selection of bottled beers.  If they don't have a beer that you like then you need to stay home to drink!  The owner even came over and introduced himself since he didn't know us and asked about our food.  I gave the place 4 stars because the bathroom was a little stinky!  it was probably because the place was crowded during the penguin game but it could have used a little refresher!  I will go back to Hal's more often.  I think it is a little gem in the North Hills!",
