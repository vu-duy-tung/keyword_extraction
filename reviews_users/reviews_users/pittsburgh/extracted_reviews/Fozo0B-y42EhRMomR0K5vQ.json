    "text": "This review will be in two parts.   The waffles. Five stars! Holy crap they are good! Crispy, yeasty goodness smeared with nutella and topped with strawberries and bananas. It was delicious and gone in about two minutes. Go to Waffallonia for the food....  ....and take it with you anywhere else to eat it before the obnoxious staff ruin it for you! We were not in a hurry so we thought we would just eat in there. They have about six seats against the walls. The place is TINY. Apparently, it was shift change. Someone's girlfriend was waiting on them and they enjoyed talking to her and making faces rather than making my waffle. What? You used the last dough? why not walk to the cooler and get another tray instead of spending five minutes bitching about it in front of customers! Oh, and, as you are leaving for the day/your break/whatever, don't stand three feet from us (the ONLY customers in the place) and  complain about how no one who comes in tips very well. Last time I checked, you get tipped for doing something OTHER THAN YOUR JOB. Try being personable. Try focusing on making my food rather than talking to your lady friend. The staff = zero stars  In closing, go to Waffalonia and get a delicious waffle. Then, walk out, without tipping, and enjoy it somewhere more pleasant.",

    "text": "Hooray for another dessert option in Squirrel Hill, and bonus points for providing something other than ice cream/fro-yo and cupcakes (I love those things, but more variety is good). This is in the space of the former Dozen Cupcakes, so it's quite small. There are three stools and three little counters towards the back of the shop if you want to eat there.  The waffles are quite good--gotta love the crunchy bits of pearlized sugar. If you're taking them to go, the best way is to order them plain, as Vikram's already said. I ordered mine with speculoos spread, which is this gingerbread-flavored spread--delicious, but not really portable.  I wouldn't get too crazy with the toppings even if you are eating in, because then the waffle goodness gets lost. But if you really, really want to load on your toppings, one of the waffle varieties you can order allows for an unlimited amount of toppings.  I love waffles, and I'm glad they've arrived in Squirrel Hill, saving me trips to either Shadyside/East Liberty (Oh Yeah! and The Waffle Shop) or Point Breeze (for Point Brugge's brunch).",

The fresh bananas were crazy fresh. The batter was sugary light fluffy. Waffle was at right serving temperature not too hot or to warm just perfect. They have an insane waffle maker it looks like it's belgium. Texture of it was heaven for your teeth. The specoulus spread was like peanut butter cream type. The whip cream don't know we're they get it but it's real fresh whip cream, wish I knew that brand. The waffle you could eat plan. Me and my friends left satisfied but I found myself wanting to go right back and eat 3 more!! Waffleonia is a wonderful foodie place. All foodies must come here",

It's worth stopping to try but I didn't find it anything more than an average snack joint. It was pretty underwhelming.",

I got a waffle with the speculoos ice cream, and that was to die for. It's a small shop, but it redefines what you look for in your waffles. My brother got the waffle with the cinnamon ice cream. The speculoos was sweeter whereas the cinnamon was more well balanced. I would have finished the whole thing, but I just finished dinner right before so I couldn't finish my waffle + ice cream or I would be sent into a sugary food coma. Both were amazingly delicious, so if you're a sweet lover like I am, you'll love these as well.",

Although I usually like everything covered in chocolate (especially nutella), these waffles don't need much. They are really perfect with just whipped cream (and possibly some fruit.) The cinnamon ice cream is also amazing and I absolutely recommend it (with or without the waffle).  The space is really small, but if you're taking your food to go or eating when the place is empty, you'll be fine. And for some reason (I don't know why) the waffles at the Squirrel Hill location are better than the Oakland location..",

    "text": "I ate here a few Sundays ago with my girlfriend for breakfast.  We had been wanting to try this place for awhile and often saw a line out the door as we drove by.  However, the morning that we went was perfect for us and we were actually the only two people in the restaurant in the 15 minutes or so that it took us to order and eat.  The menu is located behind the register and seems to be pretty simple and also very affordable.  They have 5 different waffles and toppings combinations to choose from as well as that you get to pick the toppings.  After looking everything over I decided on having the Bruges and a coffee while my girlfriend decided on the Charleroi.  I received my coffee right after ordering and we went and sat down at one of the small bars around the side of the place.  I would say that it probably could only seat about 8 people at a time.  I then decided to try the coffee and thought that it was ok but not great.  Shortly thereafter our waffles came out.  The Bruges came out as a sugar waffle topped with strawberries and whipped cream, just as I expected while my girlfriends sugar waffle came out with bananas and nutella.  I really enjoyed my waffle with my favorite part surprisingly being the waffle itself.  It had a nice sugary flavor to it which I do not know that I have experienced in a waffle before.  My girlfriend thought the same and also really enjoyed her waffle and toppings.   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future, even for an after meal treat.  The waffles far exceeded my expectations and while I do not think that a single waffle itself is enough for a meal, they are definitely cheap enough that you could buy multiple things without feeling much squeeze on your wallet.",

I'd eat them for lunch.  I'd eat them for dessert.  I'd eat them for a snack.  I'd eat them out of boredom (my doctor says I shouldn't do that, but then again, she's never had these waffles).  I'd eat them in the rain.  I'd eat them on a train.  I'd eat them on boats and with goats and in boxes with foxes.  Look, you get the idea.  They're delicious.

Depending on how much sweetness you want, you may find a waffle with no toppings sufficiently good; or if you're up for it, go ahead and indulge on the ice cream, nutella, or fruit!  Prices are decent, though I would be happy if they were a dollar or two cheaper. As other reviewers noted, service is spotty. Once the server was not so friendly; another time he was very happy to help us. Last thing is that the waffles sometimes take a long time, longer than you'd think it takes for a waffle to be made.",

I've heard a lot of great things about this place but only just dropped by the other day for dessert with friends and I was blown away. The waffles were hot and had a hearty scoop of Ice cream sat upon it, and as it melted they filled the little ridges of the waffles perfectly with sweet and richness.   The shop itself is tiny and cozy and smells delicious. There is enough seating for about 7 people but it's a good snack to have while walking around squirrel hill on a nice day.  The sugar waffles are a good medium size but the ice cream topping or whipped cream topping is quite large so I'd advise people not to eat here if they are full from a previous dinner.

I unfortunately didn't see the coupon prior to my visit, so I paid full price for my topping. I decided on cinnamon Dave and andys  ice cream. It's my favorite and I didn't know they sold it outside of their shop in Oakland. It was amazing! The waffle was hot, so the ice cream melted on top and provided just the right amount of sweetness.",

You could walk past this place many times and never notice the skinny brown building that houses the best waffles in the city.   But the moment you step through that door you know you made a good decision. The smell alone is worth the trip but the moment that sugar waffle topped with Nutella ice cream, dripping chocolate syrup, and drowning in whipped cream hits your mouth all is right with the world.   Served on a paper plate at \"tables\" that are nothing more than 2x4s stuck to a wall Waffalonia embraces the hole in the wall charm so sought after by foodies and Hipsters alike making Murray Ave a prime location for this shop.   It's hard to best a date night starting at one of the many ethnic restauraunts just down the street and ending it in the littlest slice of Belgium the city has to offer.   The best part of course is you'll leave spending under $6 I and feel like you got a lot more for what you paid.",

I don't know how good the waffle would be on it's own, but with ice cream and whipped cream ... Amazing! I forget the name of the ice cream but it's the cinnamon-ish one and it started with an 's.'  I bet the vanilla bean ice cream would also be amazing.Imagine i they had green tea ice cream and top it with honey!  YUM! Definitely a must go to place.  I don't even care for sweets and desserts and I finished mine all by myself ;)    They only have a few ice cream flavors (about 6).  I don't know how often they change it or if they do at all, but Waffallonia is next to Cold Stone, so worst case scenario you can get a scoop from there and top it with on Waffallonia's waffle.  I don't think it would be necessary, since they're ice cream is already awesome as is.",

So today I skipped breakfast and lunch to have room for dessert.  The place itself is long and narrow with a few stools in the back against some shelves that are to be used as tables. There is only enough room for 6 people. It smells like warm sugar. The air is sweet and sets off a tingling in your tastebuds. There are several options to choose from and they all start with a sugar waffle. They have things like Nutella spread, Speculose spread, bananas, strawberries, and other goodies to top your waffle. If you a really going for the full experience you can top it with ice cream. That's right . . ice cream. They have 6 flavors to choose from. It's probably a gazillion calories but worth every single one.  I had a waffle with Nutella spread and Nutella ice cream. The waffle is a bit crispy. The heat from the waffle starts to melt the ice cream. It was bite after bite of deliciousness.  I think I need to back and see if my experience was only magical because it was the first time or if it's that way every time.",

    "text": "Oh man. Waffallonia rules. In general, I'm of the mindset that breakfast foods should not be eaten for dessert -- in fact, my hubby and I have an ongoing argument about this topic (donuts being our latest point of contention). However, I was convinced once to give the mighty liege waffle a try for dessert.....and MY.MIND.WAS.BLOWN! The score is now: Tricia, 0, hubby, 1, breakfast-foods-as-dessert, 1. I concede that the waffle can in fact be a delicious post-dinner treat.  These waffles are unlike traditional breakfast waffles. They are thick and doughy with a crunchy, caramelized layer of sugar coating the outside. The waffle on its own is sweet enough to make a yummy dessert, but I always opt to load up on the toppings, because, heck, if I'm eating dessert, I'm going to do it right! I love the waffle topped with strawberry, bananas and Nutella,or a scoop of ice cream (speculoos in particular is to die for!) and chocolate sauce.   The space inside this place is really small with very limited seating, so your best bet is to take your tasty treat to go. The staff aren't the friendliest folk -- most of them seem to hate their job and it shows. Regardless, even their surly demeanor can't take away from the amazingness that is the liege waffle.",

But it's really that good.  The place is small, but I actually like taking the waffles to go. Bobby and I like to split one but I think we will have to start ordering our own waffles soon. We've had some fairly dramatic fork and knife fights.

    "text": "Located in Squirrel Hill, this place is very close to Razzy Fresh (frozen yoghurt), so it is always a toss up between the two. Sometimes the smell of fresh hot waffles draws me in to this place, but other times I am simply craving waffles and ice-cream. I fell in love with the waffles and ice-cream combo ever since I tried it a couple of years back in London and now I am hooked - I need my fix every so often.   Waffallonia makes the waffles to order (i.e. hot) and they have a decent assortment of ice-creams and fruits (vanilla ice-cream ans strawberries with a sugar waffle is the best combination IMO). They also have Nutella, chocolate sauce and some other toppings available.   The reason for the 4 stars is that the place is tiny (hardly any seating space inside), staffed with usually 2 people (waffles take long to make especially since they are to order) and that parking is always a pain (street parking). I usually go at night (around 9:30pm), which is when I can find parking easily and the rush is also less. However, I do rate this place as a must try if in the Squirrel Hill area or if you do not mind driving down.",

The place was small and the sign in front is barely noticeable and I fully expected to see Dozens bakery when I looked through the window, but I was pleasantly surprised to see waffle irons at work.  I have been dying to find a place that serves fresh hot waffles for a long time now. My boyfriend and I tried the fancified versions of the waffle at first, mine topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries and his with a chocolate-hazelnut spread (I can't remember if it was Nutella or some other brand) and sliced bananas.  Regardless of the small \"dining\" area we were fully satisfied with our waffles.  They were warm and fluffy and light so you get a fulfilling snack without it being too heavy.  Perfect snack after the movie while we waited for the bus.  We stopped in on a different occasion after dinner on a cold rainy day to grab a few of the plain sugar waffles to go.  These were perfectly portable and delicious.  I think I prefer them this way, without all of the extra toppings.    One other thing that I like about this place is that they accept cards, which is very convenient for people like me, who never carry any cash.    It's too bad that I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore.  Otherwise, I'd stop by more often.  They need to advertise their shop a bit more because I had no idea that they were there.  I even missed the sign in front.  I love the idea of the waffles being made right in front of the glass window though.",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me by bringing me a waffle home for lunch today. (I wish all lunches could be so sweet!)  Fresh strawberries and bananas lay atop my beeea-uuu-ti-ful waffle. Caramelized sugar adds an ever so slight crunch to these sweet, fluffy waffles. I know you can get Dave and Andy's ice cream served atop of these (not so ideal for takeout which is the only reason mine did come furnished with some! ;)), which I imagine would be even more heavenly. I'm sincerely glad I don't live closer to Waffallonia or this gal would be bustin' out of her jeans in no time flat!",

    "text": "This stuff is as close as it comes to what you find in Belgium. For your first time, I would recommend getting it plain to taste all the sugary flavors. My favorite is the 'Antwerp\" with the Speculoos ice cream! Gaaaah, I've already been there three times, it's a wonderful addiction! The bossman was super cool, laid back and throughly answered my questions while carrying casual conversation with me.  Their interior is SOOOOOO much better than what Dozen's made it out to be. Their menu board is an adorable train station-like departure/arrival board. They also have a cute vintage clock and an awesome divided map of Belgian. I love the stools and wall tables, nice and quaint. This place is meant to pick up a waffle, mingle for a little bit, then be on your way. It is NOT A RESTAURANT, so don't expect there to be multiple tables and lots of space to your leisure. Perhaps they will have outdoor seating when the temperatures rise, but you have to pay the city that. It has a similar feel to La Gourmandine bakery where in France they take their viennoiseries and leave.   So so pleased that this popped up in Squirrel Hill. Don't think it's kosher, though.",

    "text": "About 8 years ago, my wife and I travelled to Bruges in Belgium with our wonderful friends from London and our 8 month old son.  We had a wonderful time and brought back with us a love of many things Belgian.  1.  Fries, the Belgians are brilliant at fries, and as a sign of good fortune, a few years ago, Point Brugge opened up in Point Breeze and catered to our cravings.  2.  Beer, the Sharp Edge has been around for long enough that we have never felt a deficit on this one.  3.  Chocolate, Chocolate Moose, and Eureka and others have made sure that we have access to the really good stuff.  But.....Number 4 True Belgian Waffles have been denied to us UNTIL NOW.  Real Belgian Waffles are NOTHING like their Eggo kin, or even like the waffle press stuff that we can find at breakfast buffets all over.  These waffles are not just pancake batter thrown into a waffle iron.  This is thrice leavened sweet dough with pearlized sugar that results in a layered waffle that is both delicate and chewy in texture.  As I sat in this very cute, very tiny space, I saw a number of folks pass (I assume based on the $3 price for a basic waffle).  This is only because they know not what they miss.  For one thing, the best (and I apologize the the good proprietors of  Waffalonia if this hurts revenue) way to eat these waffles is straight up and plain (they are sweet on their own with no accouterments).  You take them wrapped in a napkin/paper, and you can walk around Squirrel Hill tempting everyone that you pass with their aroma.  This is pretty much the way it works in Belgium--at least in Bruges.  The ice cream toppings, Nutella, etc. are great but not really critical, although as long as the toppings allow you to walk around afterwords, pile 'em on.  The point is that these waffles are designed not as breakfast treats, but sweet treats that you can walk the lovely eclectic shops of Squirrel Hill with (too bad they are not in Shadyside).  These are not your mom's waffles, unless you came from Belgium and your mom had a special waffle press, access to the right type of sugar, and the patience to let her waffle batter rise three times in order to create the perfect waffle.  If all of that applies, I humbly stand corrected.",

Prices are a little steep for one waffle, but the quality is worth it as a special treat, not breakfast every day though!

Having seen several glowing reviews about them throughout several publications, they were certainly hyped up quite a bit before I finally went. I finally made it out for a mini \"Squirrel Hill Day\" (aka \"Diabetes Day\" - a trip that consisted of Rita's, Waffallonia, and bubble tea) and indulged myself in some incredible Belgian dessert waffles. Waffallonia certainly lived up to the hype! Their waffles are slightly crispy on the outside, as they have a caramelized exterior and a soft, warm interior. I got a waffle with Biscoff and whipped cream - both of which slowly melted into the crevices (and into my heart!) Seeing as this was the first time I'd ever had Biscoff spread, I was INSTANTLY HOOKED. To this day, I go to Waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of the stuff.  Only setback is that it's REALLY tiny with very few seats. Then again, I kind of find that sort of thing cozy and urban. Don't worry - the prices are decent and it never gets too crowded.",

Pittsburgh is absolutely wonderful; I can get real mussels and frites at Point Brugge, I can get a ton of Belgian beers on tap at Sharp Edge, Pittsburghers love their fries almost as much as Belgians, and now I can eat real waffles at Waffallonia. The waffles here are delicious; like most people do in Belgium, I simply eat them plain, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying them with toppings (especially Speculoos spread!).  One suggestion for Waffallonia: try to make sure people don't automatically associate these waffles as breakfast food (not that you can't have them for breakfast). In Belgium, I'd say the most popular time to eat a waffle is either 3 or 4 in the afternoon, or late at night after some beer at a cafe. Generally they're best on cold, rainy days (which Belgium has in abundance), so it's smart of Waffallonia to have Dave and Andy's ice cream toppings for tasty summer consumption (the summers here are much hotter).   As for price - despite needing to import the pearl sugar from Belgium, their basic $3 waffle is actually priced pretty much the same as a waffle would be in Brussels or Brugge; it's completely reasonable for the effort and ingredients involved in making the waffles.",

It was cold outside and, though ice cream sounded good, it may not have been the greatest choice. I am so glad I stayed. We got the cookie butter ice cream on top of a waffle with chocolate syrup. The waffle was warm and slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy and delicious on the inside. It melted the ice cream just enough to make a gooey delicious mix. It was so satisfying and delicious that I could have stuffed myself with more. Can't wait to go back!",

Thankfully Waffallonia specializes in waffles and I didn't miss out on this sweet, sweet experience.   To be honest, I was expecting Waffallonia to be a sit down restaurant and was a little surprised how tiny the store was and that there was such limited seating. I got over it quickly.   My preferred toppings were not one of the established options so I went Waffallonia. If you want to create your own experience, the unlimited toppings are really the way to go. It took me no time to decide on bananas, strawberries and a dab of whipped cream. My ice cream selection was a bit more challenging. How could I decide between all the awesome Dave and Andy flavors? Oh, I didn't have to decide. I was able to have a scoop of cinnamon and a scoop of speculoos (which was like a cinnamon).   I thought the portion was perfect. The waffle was large but not too large. The toppings were abundant but didn't overwhelm the waffle. Everything was fresh, hot and perfection. Breakfast bonus: I didn't walk out feeling like I had just stuffed myself silly.   If only they opened a Waffallonia at home in Philly...they could be assured of a frequent customer.",

As soon as I bit into the chocolaty, bananay and waffley goodness it brought my mouth to climax unlike anything any waffle has ever done for me before. I refused to share any of my waffle with my gf because it was that good. And she refused to share hers with me for the same reason. My only regret today is that I can't live here and eat these all day.   We also ordered a black coffee and a cafe latte. They were both very good as well.  Also, it's not over-priced at all. Very very reasonably priced.  In conclusion, while Dio was rocking out over the speakers, the waffles rocked my mouth harder.",

That didn't stop me from ordering a cup of Dave & Andy's cinnamon ice cream, though; I lived in Oakland when the original shop was open and fell in love with that flavor.  After moving away from Pittsburgh in 1986, I never saw it on a menu again and over time, forgot all about it.  Each spoonful I enjoyed at Waffalonia took me back to the 1980s and my many stops at the ice cream shop just up the street from my Dawson Street apartment.  If you're planning on eating in at Waffalonia, expect to get cozy as seating is very limited and the few tables there are very close together.",

I got the waffle with nutella and banana (who knows what it's actually called). The waffle itself was the perfect texture: a little crisp on the outside and chewy (in a good way) on the inside. They slathered it really generously with nutella and put an entire sliced banana on top. For less than $5, that's pretty great.  The shop is as small as it looks - we had enough room to sit, but there are some nice benches just a little ways down Murray. If the shop had been crowded, we'd probably have gone there to eat.

So I squeezed back up to the counter (the place is slightly larger than a closet, but cozy!) and ordered another one. I had more luck this time but only because I think my husband was distracted by the size of the Nutella jars there. I had two deliciously flavorful bites and by this time my husband was done trying to get the lady to sell us a bucket of Nutella so he ate the rest. I love Nutella as much as the next person but honestly the waffles were so flavorful on their own they didn't really need anything. We will definitely go back.",

I ordered the Bruges waffle, and it came piping hot, about the size of a small party plate, with diced strawberries and a swirl of whipped cream on top for about $5. It was the perfect snack for a Sunday afternoon. Only problem was the middle of the waffle was a bit raw. But that didn't stop me from digging in and eating most of it. It was delicious, the strawberries were perfectly sweet as well as the whipped cream and even the waffle had a crunchy sugary top.  My friend got one as well with chocolate ice cream and they do not skimp on that scoop of ice cream. It was large and definitively worth the additional $2. However, I found the ice cream to be a bit chalky in flavor but my friend loved it so go for it if you're thinking about it. What you might not get in quality, you definitely get in quantity.",

It's an in and out sort of place.   You don't expect a lot from it except a solid dessert and it delivers on that.     I'd give it five stars, but the service is crap.  Every time.   Usually just one sullen employee who can't smile or even really greet a customer properly.   They look so unhappy all the time.   And word to the wise - they sometimes try to pawn off the extra (already cooked) waffles.  Don't take them.  The sugar waffle has to be fresh off the waffle iron to really taste great.",

That right there, is their \"Antwerp.\"  Waffalonia's waffles are liege waffles, differing from the Belgium waffles most of us are familiar with. These waffles are a bit chewier and they have a glaze-like outer layer from the pearl sugar they use. I really can't explain the effect that gives, but what I can tell you for sure is that it's magical. Just the waffle alone is great but Waffalonia also offers an array of toppings ranging from fresh fruit, ice cream, whipped cream and spreads (like Nutella and speculoos (cookie butter)). My favorite combo is with a scoop of their vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate sauce (the Antwerp). Their ice creams are pretty special too. The waffles are small but can be rich, making it perfect for sharing. But no judgement if you have one to yourself! Prices are reasonable and wouldn't be any more expensive than a treat from their next door competitor, Coldstone.   One thing to note, this place is rather small and narrow but grabbing a seat along their walls usually isn't a problem. It shouldn't take anyone too long to devour one of these delicious waffles so seats open up quickly.   Waffalonia has become one of my regular stops for dessert and I plan on keeping it that way.",

The gentleman was extremely rude.  He attempted to reheat the waffles that were already made, and I nicely asked him for fresh hot waffles because it was my friends first time.  He took the reheated/already made waffles off and took them off with an attitude and became extremely rude.  I even apologized for asking.  However, I feel I should have to apologize for nicely asking for fresh waffles.  Isn't that your job?! Then he slammed them on the rack. I kindly thanked him twice with no response from him.  After he made our order, I thanked him again and he did not respond.  I know he heard me because there was only 2 other customers who were quietly waiting.  We felt extremely uncomfortable.  My friend was so turned off by his attitude.  Even the people in line commented on his attitude.  I would understand if we were rude, but we weren't!  We were so excited to be there an he ruined it.  I hope he's not a representation of the type of service you'll be getting this summer at the Squirrel Hill location!! Thanks for the great customer service-NOT!!!

The waffles themselves more than make up for that!! I went with the Antwerp which is their sugar waffle topped with ice cream - I got the Nutella flavored ice cream and chocolate sauce. I also added the speculoos syrup which is, trust me, only the best thing ever!! You know those Biscotti cookies that are given out on United? This is a syrup made out of those and is just about the best addition to those waffles. Definitely recommend speculoos on anything you order here. The staff is polite.

I got the Bruges liege style waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it was ok.  Nothing that I'd go out of my way to get again.",

It really only has barstool seating for 6-8 people, so if you want to come here with a group, I recommend getting waffles to go. I ordered my favorite combo - waffle topped with Nutella and Speculoos ice cream. This waffle is so delicious that you think to yourself, \"If I could never eat again, this was a good last food to have.\" I plan to mix things up a little bit this spring, trying more of the ice cream flavors and fruit toppings. However, no matter what you put on top of these waffles, they will be delicious.  Even though I enjoyed the experience, I actually would prefer going to the Oakland location in the spring/summer. This location is a dive with barstools facing a wood paneled wall. I would much rather sit outside in the sunshine in Oakland while eating one of these. However, for the cold fall/winter months, this is the place to go!",

I wasn't expecting to love this place, but the hot waffles with toppings were so much more than I hoped and dreamed.  I ordered the Namur Waffle ($4.80 with tax), which was bananas and nutella on a waffle.  One of the Squirrel Hill magazines also had a coupon for a free topping so I added some Speculoos ice cream ($2 value).  The waffles look so small, but they are actually the perfect portion and don't need to be any larger.  The actual waffles are really unique and delicious and would be good without toppings, really.  If you can, eat the waffles at their little counter space.  They are the best hot.  Otherwise, they will package them to go.  They take credit cards, and there is no minimum.",

For 6$, we chose to get: A freshly made waffle, made right in front of us; delicious strawberry and banana toppings; ice-cream: vanilla bean, chocolate and nutella; and further add ons chocolate sauce and nutella! So incredibly good and worth the buck!   A place has a very casual decor, and seats just about 6-8 people.

They have a number of different options for toppings on your waffle. I got Nutella with whipped cream, and it was bomb.  It's a tiny place, so if a few other people are there you might not have a place to sit, but still worth it for the waffles.

I got Nutella and whip cream and my wife got strawberries and whip.  The toppings were good, but the waffle was amazing.  The yeast batter that they use creates a really tender waffle, while the sugar they use creates a delicate crispy crust.  These are so good, I brought one to my wife in the hospital the day after she had our son as a reward!  She, the ambivalent one, liked them so much.  We will definitely go back for seconds.",

The waffles were still piping hot when I got home, and deliciously light as always.  The fruit is always very fresh, even in the winter...the only thing I would possibly change is to have it open earlier on weekdays!",

    "text": "Waffallonia: Not Your Average Waffles  I was never a fan of waffles as a kid. Perhaps that's because I grew up eating frozen waffle discs compliments of the toaster.  It wasn't until I went to college that waffles became a staple food item.  Choosing to skip on the daily blase offerings of cafeteria items only a freshman could love, I spent a quality three minutes at the \"Create Your Own Waffle\" station more often than not.  On adventurous nights, I'd throw a few scoops of ice cream on top and consider myself a culinary genius.  So when Waffallonia opened up in Squirrel Hill a couple years back, I threw on my freshman 15 jeans and headed on over.  I've been indulging on these sinfully authentic Belgian waffles ever since.  If you're a fan of the Americanized, made-from-batter \"Belgian\" waffles, then your waffle lovin' mind will be blown when you sink your teeth into a Liege waffle.  These waffles get their namesake from the Belgian province in which they were created.  Liege waffles are unique in that they are made from yeast dough (an adapted form of brioche dough to be precise).  This is the smell that consumes you when opening the door.  Another difference in comparing Liege waffles with our made in America waffles is that they are sweetened with pearl sugar.  This sugar caramelizes the outside of the waffle, leaving a delicious, crunchy exterior while maintaining a soft, chewy texture on the inside.  Some of the pearl sugar remains intact within the waffle too, providing unexpected little bursts of sweetness as you eat.  In other words, once you taste a Liege waffle you will literally find all other waffles subpar.   Now, if you were in Wallonia, you'd most likely eat a Liege waffle plain or with a little cinnamon, but thankfully here in Pittsburgh I can still get my fill of waffles a la mode.  There are normally six Dave and Andy's ice cream flavors to...

I've been to Waffallonia like seven times in the last few days and every time I get something different. It's awesome. The dough is sweet and chewy - the waffles have more of the consistency of thick, slightly-crispy croissants than of American waffles.  TRY THE SPECULOOS. It tastes like graham crackers and spices turned into a spread, like nutella or peanut butter-- it's truly awesome.   The only complaint I could have is that the service isn't great about half the time. A couple of servers have put their hands all over my waffle when preparing it (ew) and the plastic cutlery just seems cheap and shoddy (not to mention it's really hard to cut your waffle when you're using plastic knives). I've also seen a server picking a hair out of the waffle batter before. Gross.  Other than that, highly recommend this place to anyone and I'm definitely a hooked customer!

Waffles. Yes, WAFFLES.  I have had the distinct pleasure of enjoying waffles here three times since its opening. Every time has been enjoyable and tasty. The waffles are made with dough instead of batter, which is unique to the traditional American waffle experience. Nutella is excellent, but for a real European treat, try the Spekuloos (a spiced flavor reminiscent of Christmas.)   Waffallonia is themed like a train station, complete with maps and minimal seating. Seating is probably the only issue, but frankly the space is so small, there is little that can be done. I hope to see this business expand in the future and the people of Pittsburgh expand their waffle horizon.",

I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and heard the specaloos was worth a taste. Got the spread and bananas on top of a waffle...warm and cooked just enough to melt in your mouth, served with a knork (knife/fork--smart). Yes, it's small. Yes, there are only like three little counter tops with a couple of stools.

I enjoyed the Nutella waffle so much that I purchased a single waffle all by itself because it was that good!  This place is small only seats about 10 people max so I'd grab your dessert to go or travel light.",

    "text": "This Waffle is so good, that if you eat too many of them, this Waffle'll Own ya. Hence the name.  What to get: Liege Waffle w/Spekuloos Spread. What else: I want to recommend more things but I don't want to spread myself too thin.  Seriously, though, the name is very clever. Wallonia is the name that the Belgians call the Southern (French-speaking) part of the country. One of these days, Belgique-Belgie may split into two... the Flemish and the French. That would be a shame, but if it happens, it won't be unexpected. The title of this dessert spot is a play on the word Wallonia... one which I myself would be proud of.  If you have never been to Brussels and tried the heaven that is churned out at Maison Dandoy near the main square, the greatest Liege Waffles in the world, then this is a very very good attempt at giving you the joy without the travel expenses.  It's not as good as Maison Dandoy, and is second in the USA (probably) to Wafles & Dinges of Manhattan, but other than that, it's the best version of a Belgian Waffle that I've ever tried outside of Belgium. And the fact that they serve Spekuloos (the amazing, delicious traditional Gingerbread spread which has to be imported from Belgium itself) on their waffles (make sure you ask for it) just adds to the experience (I love parentheses) (you can probably tell) (anyway I think this paragraph is just about done, don't you).  The price is not too bad, considering it's in the most expensive fancy part of Pitt, right next to Murray & Forbes. Pop round the corner and try the Chunk Chicken and Pineapple Temptation at Rose Tea while you're here, and maybe a kebab from Turkish Kebab House. A slice from Aiello's too and you're all Squirrelled out in the best kind of way.  As for Waffallonia... It's a tiny little place with not much room to eat (just like the places in Belgium), service is fine, sometimes really friendly, sometimes curt (I mean literally my boy Curt works here, so...), and in general, it's the best dessert you can try in Pennsylvania. Pencil it in, because I hope I'm not writing this review in Vain, yeah? Get it. Pencil. Vain, yeah.  Anyway this review is so so long already. I need to end it.  No more bad jokes, or jokes in general. We're done. Not in this review anyway.  And I'm sorry for waffling so much.",

I am so glad we did!!  I got a waffle topped with Nutella, strawberries, and banana and added a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream to the top and my husband got a Nutella milkshake. Oh my god, this waffle creation was so good, y'all. All the things were mixing and melting together in the best way. It was so good, I didn't even mind that I had paid two extra dollars for a scoop of ice cream- it was worth every cent and a fairly generous scoop.   The food was amazing but I was bummed out that the seating area was so small. A huge group of young high schoolers came in and grabbed up every seat leaving me and my husband to hold our almost two year old son at a standing table. No matter! I will absolutely be back and I can't wait to try something else scrumptious!",

The Charleroi Waffle is also a nice treat with strawberries, bananas and Nutella. Definitely a good sugar fix. Evidently the also offer coffees and other hot beverages which is nice.  The downside is being a small storefront there is very limited seating and I'd venture it could get relatively crowded in the small space which they have. Definitely worth checking out!",

The space is tiny, enough for a prep area, cash register, and two tiny breakfast bars to  eat inside on - which is interesting because I haven't really seen a good to-go method from here.  The variety of simple selections is made complicated by the menu - naming waffles after various regions of Beligum and associating toppings with them. To make things easy, you pick a waffle, and optionally spreads, ice cream, whipped cream, and fruit toppings. There is only one important option: Speculoos, a sort of graham-cracker-butter imported right out of Belgium. If a hearty smear of this on top of a warm fresh waffle doesn't turn your worst day around, you might need to see a psychiatrist.  The ice cream comes from Dave and Andy's. I've had it once and, not being the biggest ice cream fan, thought the portion way too much - but people enjoy ice cream(you presumably would if you ordered it..) will probably rejoice over this. A plain waffle costs $3, and toppings are about $1, but an unlimited-topping waffle is $6, so prices stay very reasonable. Also, be on the lookout for seasonal specials: The pumpkin waffle(with Speculoos AND pumpkin pie spread was out of this world).",

My waffle was not cooked all the way in the middle, and I didn'even blink an eye I just kept swooping that delicious forkful of belgian inspired wonder right onto my tongue. Coffee is priced fairly cheap just drip coffee buts ok in a pinch for coffee. I love lattes and cappucinos so I would love if they had this option on their menu, but that would make it more of a patisserie than a waffle shop. All in all fun little stop great snack to warm you up from your shopping trips down murray ave.   I don't know how it compares to Oh yeah's over in shadyside but after comparing yelp reviews I chose it over the 3rd waffle shop which is close to Oh yeahs (name escapes me). The only gripe I have with some of the shadyside eats and treats places including Oh yeah's are the hours catering to nightlifers. That may be good for business but you're missing business from us thirty somethings who graduated kindergarten and love to enjoy brunch at brunch time (sunday morning to afternoon!) :)",

We only had a week together and this was the first place we were going to go based on how much I enjoyed coming here a few years ago. She got the Antwerp and I got a custom waffle with nutella and vanilla ice cream. We were probably the first customers that morning so the minimalist seating was just fine for us. We greatly enjoyed our waffles, which didn't cost more that six bucks. I'd highly recommend coming here if you're going to be in Pittsburgh. It's worth it.",

But then we discovered Waffalonia, and go pretty much once a week.  It is the perfect opportunity to go on a short walk and eat some absolutely delicious waffles.  I actually don't mind the seating - I don't think the store owners really intend for the restaurant to be a place where you hang out indefinitely with your friends.  Could it be that?  Sure.  But by depriving you of proper seating options (which, btw, I can't say has ever bothered me... my husband and I hang out in there with no problems whatsoever) they make you focus on what's important, and that is how freaking delicious their offerings are.  My husband and I talk until we get the waffles, and then there's just silent munching and mooning over the waffles until they are all gone.  And then we start talking again, usually about how awesome the waffles are and how glad we are that there's a place like this in Squirrel Hill.  Just as a funny side- note, for those of us who grew up in the 80s, try to think of the Animaniacs song, but with Waffalonia instead.",

It is a mochi donut texture when you first bite into it, but then come the little crystals of sugar which add the most amazing sweetness. The Nutella was perfect with the strawberries which were a little sour paired with the sweet Nutella. The whipped cream was super fresh and had the most delicious milky taste.

The waffles themselves are sugar coated so the entire concoction is really sweet. Very soft/smooth ice cream. We got two ice cream flavors on our waffle for $6-7. Great for two people, overkill for one person. You can also add various fruit and nut toppings. Only downside is that the place is really small (only 3 tables) so it could be crowded at dessert rush hour. Be careful taking the waffles outside because the soft ice cream melts very fast even in air conditioning.",

I used to always get my waffle freshly made, but I actually watched a pre-made waffle be put back into the grill to be heated. I didn't think much of it until it came out and wish I had said something. The waffle was not even the slightest bit crispy on the outside, and it was so small! It wouldn't have covered the whole waffle grill. Ultimately, it was just a warm, soft, sweet waffle with Nutella and fruits, something I could have easily made by myself at home. To me, it's the crispy crunch of the outside that's hard to achieve and is what makes ordering and paying for a waffle worth it. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't come back for sub-par waffles unless I'm really REALLY craving something sweet.",

These are made with pearl sugar and they don't need any additional syrup because they're perfect on their own. Buttery sugary yeast goodness. Normally they have a bit of a crisp on the outside due to the sugar caramelizing on the waffle iron but this one is on the softer side and lacks that crisp. Flavor wise, however, the waffle is good and on point. You can add toppings or get ice cream with your waffle. We tried the plain one to compare to what we had in Brussels and it was close!   They make them fresh as you order. Not much seating so it's more of a walk in and walk out shop. Different types of ice cream also available in case you don't like waffles.",

    "text": "OVERALL: if I could only have one dessert in Pittsburgh, I would choose a Waffallonia waffle. There are a variety of toppings available, and best of all, they go on top of a sugary, warm, crispy waffle that may be the best waffle I've ever eaten in my life. Waffles can get a bit expensive, but can be shared between 2 people.  Whenever my friends come visit Pittsburgh, they ask me for food recommendations. Depending on their tastes, I recommend a few restaurants that I think they'll like. However, I always make sure to recommend Waffallonia to everyone - that's how good it is.  The waffles here are the highlight, not the toppings. While the toppings are certainly fresh and tasty, nothing can compare to how amazing the waffles are. They have just the right amount of sugar to be sweet, but not overly so, and are cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, but chewy once you bite into the warm, delicious inside. I've never had a bad waffle at Waffallonia, and I've been here at least 10 times, so they are very consistent as well. As for toppings, you can choose fruits (strawberries/bananas), ice cream (their speciality is the speculoos flavor), nutella, and chocolate sauce.  I don't know how Waffallonia does it, but I do know that I have to convince myself to not come here twice a week, lest I die from excessive sugar consumption. You MUST try this place!",

Waffalonia has changed my life for the better, and how many places can you say that about? No matter how full I am after dinner, sometimes one friend in my group decides he wants to stop by, and once I step in and smell the fresh dough, there's no turning back. You have a separate stomach for dessert and waffalonia proves that's a fact.  The waffles are always nice and warm off the oven, super soft, and nice and sugary. They're so good that they'd taste amazing on their own, but I usually order it with their speculous ice cream. I love how the coldness of the ice cream contrasts the warmness of the waffle, and each bite is just heavenly. The speculous ice cream is my favorite.. it just complements the taste of the waffle beautifully and though it's really sweet every bite just packs a punch.  Another option is to add fruits, but from my personal experience speculous ice cream is the definite way to go. My friend described this place as \"dank af\" and I believe that's the best two word summary you could give it. I'm craving it now just writing about it...",

Their waffles, which are always fluffy, rich, and delicious, are made with pearl sugar, which caramelizes when the waffle is cooking on the iron, giving it a unique flavor unlike American waffles.  I've been to Waffalonia twice--once to this location, and once to the stand in Schenley Plaza--and both times, the waffles have been incredible.  The first time, I came here and ordered one topped with strawberries and whipped cream.  The second time, I went to Schenley Plaza and ordered one topped with speculoos (spread made of ground up cinnamon Christmas cookies) and cinnamon ice cream.  For both of them, the flavors of the toppings complemented the waffles nicely, providing a delicious and balanced dessert.  The staff can be kind of curt at times, but deal with it--the waffles are worth it.  Both this location and the Schenley Plaza one are basically take out only, so if you need somewhere to eat your waffle, you can take it across the street and eat it on the bench at the park by the post office.",

Heads up, though; The waffles are made quite slowly (only about 5 min, but longer than what I had experienced in Belgium). Check out the Speculoos ice cream! It's made locally (by Dave and Andy's) and it's divine.   ...Now if only I could find a place that served frites with andalouse sauce, I would be in True Belgian bliss!",

We walked into the small, Belgium-inspired shop and were instantly hit by the aroma of fresh waffles, syrup, and melted chocolate....mmmhmmm. Using the check-in coupon for a free topping, I ordered one of their Liege waffles and added strawberries and swapped nutella for cookie butter (hardest decision of my life lol). They make the waffles right in front of you, so you see the whole seemingly simple, yet delicate process. My waffle had the perfect crisp and perfectly complemented the fresh fruit, but what I bit into was nutella instead of the cookie butter I ordered; no worries, it was still delicious, just not what I had intended on having. My friend really enjoyed his waffle too. It is a pricey place, for the size of the waffle, but I think it makes up for it in the ambiance and quality of ingredients.",

When you get your waffle, it doesn't look like much on the plate and you might even get a pang of regret for paying the asking price for it,  But once you have your first bite, you won't remember why you ever felt bad about getting it!  That was my first experience at Waffallonia.  Getting waffles or pastries for breakfast / brunch is usually something I reserve as a treat and not something I do everyday, so whatever I get definitely has to be good or I won't return.  But I'd absolutely come back to Waffallonia.    The decor of the place is simple since it's in a small space, but it has a cute travel theme to it with a menu board that looks like an old-time flip arrival/departure board in airports and a bar and stool area for eating. They also serve coffee/espresso options.",

Everything was delicious together except the waffle itself was lacking.  I compare all my waffles to this tremendous place in Seattle called Sweet Iron, but this one wasn't too shabby.  The nutella overwhlemed the flavor of the waffle at some point and if you know anything about nutella, it's pretty thick and difficult to eat when there's too much of it.    Also ordered the hot chocolate which was actually quite good.  I won't be returning to Pittsburgh soon but I'm happy I made the jaunt out to Waffallonia to try it out.",

These waffles are special. They are made with yeast-risen dough balls, NOT pancake batter.  Their own website says it best: \"The yeasted dough is made from scratch out of the best quality ingredients - including pearl sugar imported from Belgium. It's this special sugar that gives the Liege waffle its distinctive flavor and texture. When cooked in a heavy-duty cast iron griddle, the sugar nibs carmelize and create a sweet & crunchy outer shell which envelops the doughy waffle within.\"  I've had the waffles with toppings a couple times, but I'm looking forward to summer when I can take a plain one around town as a walking snack, in proper Belgian fashion.",

The shop is tiny and somehow manages to seat 6 at counters inside. Also at the shop they have ice cream that you can add to your waffle. The flavors for ice cream seemed amazing but I was there for one thing and one thing only: liege waffles. I settled on the monthly special which was a waffle with chocolate syrup, whipped cream and crushed candy cane.  Usually my son and I split a waffle with nutella but  we changed it up that day and the change was good.",

But let's be honest, you're considering Waffalonia for the food not the atmosphere! I had a seasonal special: the lemon and blueberry waffle. The sweetness was over the top. You can taste high amounts of sugar in the waffle and in the lemon sauce. The blueberries were the least sweet of the plated items, but this was simply a result of relativeness. I liked the hint of freshness/liveliness that the berries provided. The lemon sauce added degrees of creaminess and sourness to the waffle which I liked. Lastly, the waffle itself was both fluffy and crispy which made for a pleasing textural contrast. The waffle was definitely on the heavier side.  If you have a sweet-tooth, then Waffalonia is spot you should check out in Pittsburgh!",

I saw that there was a belgian waffle place near to where we were staying while visiting Pittsburgh, and we happened to be able to stop by one night for dessert.  Okay, I lied...it wasn't chance, we may have planned on visiting all along.  Anyway, Waffallonia is a small waffle shop near the top of Squirrel Hill.  Although I only tried the plain waffle, they have a variety of toppings, including strawberries, bananas, nutella, and ice cream.  The waffle was great - just the right king of chewy dough and crunchy sugar you want from your belgian waffle.  Just a quick note here - maybe the fact that they don't open until 11 should be a hint already, but these are dessert waffles, not breakfast waffles, unless you want a fairly sweet breakfast.  So plan accordingly.  They make them right when you order them - we arrived at a bad time and had to wait a while for ours, but also means that when you do get your waffle, it'll be fresh and pipping hot.  Yum yum yum.",

The waffle had a terrible texture - like chewing gum that has been left out to harden. It's not quite hard but it's not soft either. There wasn't a nice crisp crust and a soft inside that waffles should have. He waffle also tasted more like sugar than anything else. The saving grace was the ice cream, but even that didn't blow me away as I'm not particularly a fan of Dave and Andy's. I want to give them another chance, but for $8 for two scoops of ice cream and a bad waffle, I probably won't be back soon.",

Since there are only 5-6 stools there to begin with, this was a problem.  We had the strawberries and whipped cream waffle which was tasty and were going to go for a second waffle but the crowd started bothering us, so we left.

But location-size doesn't matter in this case because it's all about the waffles.  Waffallonia starts its attack on your senses from the very moment you walk by the door. Once inside, the sweet waffle goodness entangles your brain and instantly causes drool. You're doomed from the start.  There are six set menu items all involving the star of the show... liege waffles. If you're not familiar with liege waffles they're light and fluffy yet crispy and made with pearl sugar which adds a hint of sweetness. Because of that sweetness, I view the waffles as more of a dessert, but these waffles would be good at any time of day. Seriously. Waffle cravings can hit you at any time of the day.  I ordered the \"Antwerp\" which is a liege waffle, your choice of Dave & Andy's ice cream, and chocolate sauce. I chose speculoos ice cream mostly because I had never had it before but vanilla, chocolate, and a few other ice cream flavors are available.  The waffle itself was dense yet airy. And the speculoos which tasted like cinnamon, cookies, and heaven plus the chocolate sauce created one of my new favorite flavor combinations. I would have liked the pearl sugar to come through with a little more sweetness but don't let stop you from trying something from this tiny shop.  Waffallonia is a must stop when in Squirrel Hill... before, after, or instead of dinner.",

I highly recommend getting a spread and ice cream. My favorite combination is speculoos spread ( a type of spread made of shortbread cookies) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (where you can actual flecks of vanilla bean).

I was told it got busy later in the evening. It was clean and smelled like I wanted 50 waffles. Don't worry I only got one. I got the Charleroi with nutella, banana, strawberries, & whip cream. I also got a plain coffee. The music playing was all songs I knew, which was nice to bop my head to. My waffle was delicious! I can't speak for the ice cream, but everything else was fresh and made quickly. The place is small, but I love that. Instead of sitting, I stood up while chatting with the guy working there. He was nice! I love having this place in my neighborhood because I can walk here and treat myself whenever I want. It's a plus they're open late!",

    "text": "After dinner on Sunday night, my boyfriend wanted to take me out for a treat. I'd seen the check-in offer, and it was close, so I suggested we get some waffles. My boyfriend was originally thinking bubble tea, but he was happy to try Waffallonia as well.  The storefront is very narrow, but the shop is cozy though tight. The smell of sugar fills the store. I ordered a waffle with speculoos ice cream ($3 + $2), and my boyfriend got the Antwerp (waffle, ice cream, plus chocolate sauce for $5). Since my check-in offer took off the $2 for the ice cream, the person taking our order offered the chocolate sauce for me as well since it would be free, and I agreed. Both he and the person making the waffles were friendly and efficient.  We got seats in the back--there are 2 seats against each of 3 walls. It's a tight fit, especially if a third person drags over another chair. The waffles were ready within a few minutes, and we dug in. I wish my waffle were crisper on the outside and not as soft inside (it seemed a little undercooked). However, I loved the combination of the ice cream with the waffle. The ice cream itself had great flavor, and it was a generous scoop. The temperature contrast between the cold ice cream and hot waffle was great, and I loved how the ice cream melted into the holes on the waffle. I regret the chocolate sauce a little, since it made everything a little too sweet. Overall, though, both my boyfriend and I enjoyed the treat, and the check-in offer is a great deal on already-reasonable prices. I'll be sure to stop in soon!",

We tried to go to Pamela's, but they are stuck in 1974 and they only take cash (bizzare).  We got waffles and ice cream for our breakfast which did nothing for our aching muscles after moving for the last four days.  The waffle itself was actually good.  I wish I had gotten just a few waffles and skipped the toppings, but I do possess all my girl bits so I ORDERED ALL THE SUGARY GOO.  So yep, it was good, waffle was good, ice cream seemed to be of a descent quality and the service was more than adequate.",

The chunks of sugar in my waffle could have been without... makes it feel like the dough is inconsistent or raw, plus the extra sugar seemed excessive. Strawberry bits were good and overall waffle was tasty.  The place is small with limited bar seating. The plates were small and it was difficult to keep it all together without it making a mess.

Wafflonia is a regular dessert place- nothing special (like the organic/GMO free/paleo/non-dairy/ or gluten free desserts). But it makes an exception- Wafflonia is actually really delicious.   They tend to run out of certain ice cream flavors so you have to play around to enjoy alternative flavors. So I got a scoop of strawberry ice cream topped with bananas and strawberries with dollops of whipped cream- all on top of a sugar waffle. My 4-yr old daughter and myself ate it up in a flash. I was impressed. It was that good.",

I rarely buy desserts but I make an exception for those waffles whenever my sweet tooth calls.  That being said, the service is atrocious. I've been here twice recently and for such a lovely dessert the workers are rude af. Twice I've not been greeted when walking in even tho it was empty. Twice the workers have huffed and puffed and looked like they just couldn't be bothered to make my waffle. Twice I've had my waffle thrown, not sat down nicely in front of me, but THROWN down on to the table in front of me. The first time it happened I was so shocked that thought it was an accident. But again last night, thrown on to the table. This is unacceptable. No friendliness or pleasantries at all but rather people that look like they would rather be anywhere else in the world than serving you a waffle.",

There was only one person behind the counter, -who was very friendly and had a great smile- so the ordered items came in with about 3 minutes difference. This may be something to be aware of if you're in a hurry. The eat in area is a counter facing the wall with 6 seats in total. The seat I took was wriggling when I sat down, hope this will be replaced with a new stool or at least get it screwed tightly. Taking out the plain waffles and having a walk around the area would be a nice plan when the weather gets better.",

The seating area has tiny, precariously wobbly stools to sit on-- something more substantial would make a big difference. Also it is very challenging to eat the waffles with that very-flimsy plasticware. Finding a sturdier alternative, or even actual metal, washable utensils for the customers would be a tremendous improvement. Furthermore, their bathroom smells very strongly of mildew and bleach (don't sit near it), and service can be iffy-- sometimes cheerful, helpful and wonderful, other times someone gruff and grim is working the counter.
