I love the chicken and broccoli, shrimp egg rolls, steamed dumplings, and crab rangoon, in particular. I never eat in (there's a few tables), so I always pick up or get delivery. For pick up, my order is made quickly after I call; for delivery, it takes 45-60 mins. They have never once messed up on my order. Definitely check out this place if you're looking for some delicious Chinese take out.",

I even decided to go to them for a big order when entertaining out of town friends and my guests raved. The veggies are fresh, crisp and plentiful, the meat is tender and wholesome looking without hidden gristle and nasty parts ( a pet peeve of mine). Delivery is fast and the prices are right. I used to order from WaiWai down the street, but they tend to have on again, off again quality. China House is always good. The portions are large, too. I love them.",

I took a shot on China House and was so unbelievably surprised by the food. It was easily the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot, as Chinese is, without a doubt, my favorite cuisine, so I've eaten it a lot in my life. the boneless ribs were the juiciest, most tender boneless ribs I've ever had; the rice was superb, and the egg rolls were amazing. It was so good, I wound up eating there numerous times in that month I was there, and still today, I find myself comparing it to the Chinese food here in Miami where I live. Still have not found any that comes close to PA's China House. My father felt the same way, and when he learned he might have to go back to PA in Sept, he taunted me with how he was going to the China House, it was that amazing! On a final note, it was so good, I made sure to bring back a menu from there so I wouldn't forget where it was, in case I go back.",

In my book it's better than Wai Wai a couple blocks down, just because the prices are lower and the food is spicier. There is also a wider variety of menu items available here than other Chinese takeout places in the area, and while that doesn't necessarily indicate superiority I've found that the various dishes actually taste different from one another and the quality is consistent. I don't like it when the General Tso's chicken tastes exactly like the sesame chicken, and that's definitely not the case at China House. Also, the employees are wonderful and they're open super late. What's not to like?",

Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service.

While flipping through yelp, I came across the China House on Liberty Ave. I was less than a mile away and the reviews were good so I decided to give it a try.  First of all, most of the lunch specials are around $5.50 including shrimp dishes and dishes like General  Taos's which can sometimes be a little bit more. All of the lunch dishes come with a generous serving of pork fried rice.  I ordered the chicken and broccoli directly from the yelp app. The broccoli had great flavor and wasn't over cooked. The chicken, although a little chewy, was comparable to most other Chinese restaurants around.   Overall, the portion and quality was substantial for $5.72. I will definitely be returning to try some of the other lunch specials.  Ps. Don't forget your fork and napkins!",

Honestly maybe I just had a bad experience but the chicken was super dry and it didn't actually have any sauce on it, the fried rice was just off for me. I couldn't eat much of either it was pretty bad. The sides I got were good, everything's reasonably priced, and the service was super quick, but I did not eat much of the main course I ordered as I found it just unpleasant to eat. I'll probably try this place again but will dine in as it seems to have some positive reviews.",

Although my friend was the one ordering, it was a bit difficult to determine our orders since the person taking the call said that it was an additional $1 for fried rice and the total came out to $10+ per dish. Gosh! We just wanted sesame chicken with fried rice! She finally said that we wanted the combination platter which came out to $8.29 each.   The food was ready quickly. We were SO hungry! The meals came with an egg roll which wasn't bad. However, they forgot to put utensils and sauce. The food itself wasn't too bad. It was filling and what I had expected. It wasn't anything extraordinary but it was good enough. Lunch is definitely a good deal since the dishes are about $5.50 each or so.",
