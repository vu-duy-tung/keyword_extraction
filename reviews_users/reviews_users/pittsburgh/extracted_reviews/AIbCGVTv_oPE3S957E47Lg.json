This location has a very large parking lot and the restaurant is pretty large.  It was very clean and we were seated quickly.  I had the waitress pick the sandwich for me and I got the sirloin steak sandwich.  As you've read a gizzillion times, it's cut white bread, fries and slaw on the meat.  Although the fries seem like they had been sitting around for a while in the kitchen, I was pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoyed it. It's not a lot of meat, but it's also not a thin layer of nothingness either.  The ratio of fries and slaw with the meat really worked well for me.  The atmosphere was great because Pittsburgh sports fans are enthusiastic.  The Pirates game was on and there was a lot of cheering for their hometown faves.  It's worth the trip for the vibe and for the grub.",

The service is very friendly and fast. Their dessert is great, too.  I hope to come back next year.",

While this Primanti Brothers do not have the classic appearance of the original restaurant in the strip district it does offer the same classic Primanti Brother food. I have tried several of the Classic Sandwiches and my favorite is the Cajun Chicken. This Primanti Brothers is located near our Hotel and we tend to visit several times whenever I am in the area. We are always greeted and seated promptly and our waitress quickly appeared and took our drink order. Once our order was taken our food was prepared and delivered quick. During football season this would be a great place to catch a Steelers game and since the Pirates are back in the mix catch a baseball game here too if you can't make it to the park. As always our food was good and is the reason we keep returning.",

    "text": "Primanti Brothers is a Pittsburgh staple! The Burgh take on the classic sandwiches. You begin with delicious Italian bread which is filled with the scrumptious meat of your choice and then French fries and slaw are piled high to complete these monster sandwiches.   This location has plenty of parking and is relatively large inside. It gives you that sports bar feel rather than a downtown sandwich joint like you get in the warehouse district. The inside is relatively clean and the waitress we had on our last visit was pretty attentive even though we had a large party.   I think the prices are fine for what you get from the sandwiches. That is what partly makes the restaurant a must go. Their reputation could allow them to charge more but they don't do that. This is definitely a hometown fav. Try it when you come through!",

As hubby silently rolled his eyes and urged me to rethink my decision while reluctantly  giving in to my wish to go to Primanti, we drove into a crowded parking lot.  Upon entering this sports type bar, the  loud environment with TVs everywhere didn't bode well with me for such a great experience.. I only came for the food, not the noise. Certainly not a place for conversation, but it appears a place for the Pittsburgh fans to hang out.     I tried the pastrami sandwich done the Primanti way, with Cole slow and fries on the sandwich. Loaded with Cole slaw and fries (not enough pastrami but they do have a double meat version if you are interested) I found the sandwich to be good, not great. The Cole slow was sweet, and the fries were just greasy and so so.  Hubby was kind enough to not say \"I told you so\".  Went for the experience, and won't be needing to do it again.",

    "text": "It's a Pittsburgh institution. You know it by heart. Fries and slaw on all the sandwiches. The locals love it. It's revered nationwide. Perhaps even larger than that. But I can't say I've ever been supremely bowled over by the food at any of the locations.  I think first and foremost for me it's the slaw. Hey, I love cole slaw, be it sweet or otherwise. But Primanti's slaw just seems to overpower everything else on their sandwiches, including the fries, which do their own thing trying to battle it out for top taste when mashed in with everything else you have going on between two slices of bread.  And, like another reviewer said, the Pittsburgher is just not very good at all due to the mushy, salisbury steak-like quality of the meat. There are a couple other local places around here that use the same kind of meat (Portofino's comes to mind with their hamburger hoagie), and I can't figure out why. Why go this route when you could just use good old ground beef or chuck, fry up a patty and cut it in half? It's bordering on meatloaf here, but meatloaf that's trying to taste like a burger and it's just weird.  Other sandwiches I've had here such as the jumbo and cheese fare better. Finding a sandwich that suits your tastebuds might take a few attempts to nailing down the right one. Although, there are plenty here who enjoy it right out of the gate and swear by it. Sometimes hype does indeed work.  The next time I visit, I plan on trying the chicken wings, which is a relatively new thing on the menu. I hear they're really good, and I'm a sucker for tasty wings. All in all, Primanti Brothers is a place you'll either love or wind up scratching your head at, wondering what all the fuss is about. I love Pittsburgh and its endless enjoyable food options. I just always feel like I should love Primanti's more since everyone else does.",

We're native 'Burghers and have been going to Primanti's (the original Strip location) since 1979 and on our way through Moon, we took our two boys to this location to enjoy a taste of the Burgh.  Well.. after the first bite, we knew immediately they had saved their French Fries from the night before and used them on us (we were there at 11:15 am - just after they opened on December 27th).  How did we know????  The fries were cold - they tasted stale - like day old fry oil - they were HOLLOW INSIDE - HOLLOW!!  Terrible - just terrible.  You want to save your cole slaw in the fridge, okay - keep the lunch meat - for sure - bread saved for the next day (okay, if stored properly) - BUT GIVE ME A BREAK - SAVING FRIES!?!?  Horrible.  Pass this dump by and do yourself a favor - go to the Strip District location - been going there for almost 40 years and never had a bad experience.  As for this place - they should have to eat their own OLD FRIES for the rest of their lives.....",

    "text": "Love this place and this location!. Ordered take out for my best friend and I! We both ordered the Colossal Fish sandwich with everything on the side. I know what your thinking \"you cant do that\" But you can and when ordering takeout, If you don't want your food getting as soggy order things on the side. It was excellent a per usual. Though it lives up to its name, it really is colossal! I've dinned in at this location before and I have to say both experiences have been great. The staff is always friendly and prompt to help. My takeout only took 15 mins. by the time I ordered and drove there it was ready. Thanks Primanti Bros for always being awesome!",

    "text": "I basically come to one of Primanti Bros whenever I come to Pittsburgh to visit family. Some of them are different like I know the one in the strip district only has sandwiches. I decided to finally review this restaurant because I really do like the sandwiches and I would actually rate them a 4 or a 41/2 but this location I just had really bad customer service and will not go back to this one when I am in town.  The sandwich I had was the black angus steak sandwich I got it with a an egg and and onion. The ratio of the slaw, fries, and meat was perfect. The waitress did however manage to dump my food all over the place when she set down and basically just walked away. The wait was also pretty long even though it was a Tuesday afternoon and it wasn't to busy. The other waitress in the building seem to be doing fine we just kind of got stuck with one that didn't want to be there.  Overall the food was good or above average just like any of the the other restaurants I just didn't like the service at this one.",

The waitress said the bartender told her the tap was changed today and would be lighter than normal, which makes no sense. The acting manager came by and I asked about it again and was told the manager had been drinking it all day so it was obviously right. Slightly annoyed at this point, received my food which turned out pretty good (honey buffalo wings) but had to ask for my side, sauce and silverware. The waitress seemed steadily more annoyed and didn't refill drinks or return to the table until she was requested through the manager.",

    "text": "We stopped here as soon as we landed in Pittsburgh. This was suggested to us by a Pittsburgh native. We were very satisfied with the food we ordered and with the service we received. Although this place is more like a bar I would take children, but only during the day. It doesn't seem like a place to take children at night.   For starters we ordered the fully loaded nachos. This came with chili, cheese, jalapenos, salsa, and sour cream. It was $7.95 and enough to feed at least 5 people! The chili was very tasty and the salsa was fresh and had a little kick to it.   We then ordered the chicken wings and had honey mustard sauce added into it. This was OK( but it could be because I was starting after a 6 hour flight) the wings came out burnt and it seems they just dipped the burnt wings into honey mustard sauce.   My husband ordered the \"when pigs fly\" sandwich and he was really please. This sandwich was HUGE! It was enough to feed to starving adults (so I would half the order with someone). We also had some cheese fries with our order. The fries came out soggy and the cheese was like cheese from a can. Yuck!   All in all my favorite was the nachos!",

I was accompanied by a friendly but annoying fruit fly. The paper towel dispenser was empty so I dried my hands on my pants.  Someone other than our server brought our sandwiches to our table. He tried to figure out which was which for a minute until we told him to just set them down and we'd figure it out. We also saw him stroll the length of the dining room with tray of food looking for its expectant diners.  The fries on our sandwiches ranged in color from dark brown to black and in texture from crunchy to rock hard. And they were cold. We sent them back and they were replaced by acceptable ones.  It's really sad that the Primanti Brothers once proud name is attached to a place that stinks of corporate greed and apathy.",

    "text": "Went to Primanti Bros for first time last night since moving from Ohio.  We had family in town visiting and everyone wanted to see what the hype was about.  There were 8 of us.Well, first experience of Primanti less than impressed.    After they sat us one waitress rudely told the other that she needed to move the tables.  So we all had to stand back up move the 2 tables down and then sit back down.  Once we sat down one table leg was uneven so the table wobbled the entire time(table next to us had a napkin under one lag to level it out).  This showed lack of attention from management staff.  Told our waitress that none of us had ever eaten here before and asked what she recommended.  Her answer was \"I eat all of it\" we were hoping for a less generic response.  Every person that works in a resturant has tried multiple items and should be able to offer more assistance than that.  So everybody orderes something different.  Nachos and wings were excellent. As for the sandwiches when we asked what the Pitts-burger was she said it was a ground beef patty with the fries and slaw.  I was expecting a hamburger patty which it was not.    Not sure what the meat was.  The turkey sandwich was good.  So the food was hit or miss.   As we were eating a server spilled some drinks, which happens.  However when someone came to clean it up they slipped and used someone in our party to csth themselves and hit them in the back.  Again accidents happen but there was no sorry no are you ok.   Overall service was poor and food was ok.  Less than impressed.  Kind of embarrassed tobtake family to a resturant that is supposed to be a Pittsburgh staple.",

None of the flavors were overpowering, they all melded perfectly together.  The fries in the sandwich and in the basket were a bit bland and needed a good sprinkling of salt, but once the salt was added, it was perfect.  This particular branch was not too busy, plenty of parking, we had an attentive young waitress (Jess) and we were served in a timely manner.  Glad to have stopped in.

    "text": "Man. This was our second try at this location, the first being The day after St. Patrick's this year. Our son goes to school out here and we have been trying to enjoy local flavor, but this place just doesn't do it for me. I had the pittsburger last time and thought all I could taste was cole slaw, which, while good, didn't allow for any other flavors. Thought we would try again today and had a disappointing visit. To start, We specifically went during a steelers game, as as expected, the place was packed. This was what we wanted, locals!! But sadly, it became very apparent that this location couldn't handle the capacity. The women's toilet overflowed and the bathroom floor was wet, the men's bathroom stunk.  The music was too loud to hear the game, our server was friendly enough but she was swamped and we could tell. We were probably there 2 hours and by the time she realized we needed a second beer, we were 10 minutes from being handed the check. The food was hit and miss. Our chili cheese fries came fast and were disgustingly awesome, but that was the highlight. We waited a half hour for our main meals - pittsburger (son says was great), cheeseburger (husband unimpressed and fries were cold) buffalo chicken burger (they forgot the bleu cheese and the buffalo sauce is sweet!?) a kids cheeseburger that didn't get finished (although she raved about the Dole cup of peaches that she said were \"so Fresh!!\"... She's 6) and my buffalo wing salad... Eh. Iceberg lettuce, a handful of tomatoes, onions, cucumber... Very basic. Not in love with the sweet buffalo chicken. I mean, just not anything to write home about. Inadequate staffing on game day, gross bathrooms, sub par food, it only gets two stars for the chili fries and the pittsburger. Going elsewhere next time we are in town.",

    "text": "I feel 3/5 is fair bc it's more like 2.5. We live super close to here and were excited to have a Primanti's right down the hill bc we just love that it's relaxed, good for groups, and good food. Put it this way -our rehearsal dinner was at the Mt. Lebo location in 2016. I digress. This location however needs some improving. The difference in quality of food AND wait staff is noticeable. The food has never been outright BAD, but I have no time for crappy service. It's been a few months since we've gone (compared to probably every other week) because of our last visit. It was a pizza feast night and we ordered two fountain drinks while deciding if we were going to get that, then we did end up ordering it. That comes with a pitcher of pop/soda -which was never brought out to us but it really didn't matter as we had cups already. Long story short, we were charged for the two fountain drinks and when my husband asked the waitress about it, she informed him (with way too much attitude) that it was OUR fault for ordering those prior. I know enough to realize that fountain drinks cost restaurants pennies -that's why you get free refills. We both couldn't believe she was arguing about this so we just said \"okay\" and handed her the credit card. Upon her return she had taken the two drinks off and acted like she did us a huge favor. That was the icing on the cake of multiple less than great experiences we kind of just ignored -drinks never getting refilled, wait staff disappearing for 15+ min and coming back smelling like a cigarette, pizza being significantly less appetizing than other locations, burned wings, etc.  The convenience outweighed all of this previously, but not anymore. If someone suggests going here fine, but I will never suggest it.",

    "text": "This is my first time at a Primanti Bros and it was awful.  Food is below mediocre.  Buffalo wings were gross, the chicken on the salad and pizza were low grade, looked like the cheap frozen type chicken.  I gave it a star because their fries were really good and the BLT tots.  As for our waitress, she seemed drugged out.  She was annoyed with serving us, she didn't set the drinks out but handed them to us (like getting irritated when we didn't grab them/notice fast enough)... she also put her hand out for us to return the menus to her... I'm not petty but if you're going to be a server it's the little things.  Her finger nails were dirty (if you're in food service clean nails/hands is important).  She also was rubbing her eyes and mouth/face, super disturbing hygiene for someone handling your food.  Over all I'm going to say try somewhere else in the Burgh!! Definitely do not reccomend",

Tonight may have made it a last one!!  We came in and it wasn't busy, that's a first for us. I expect to have a little bit of a wait time, or even a little lesser service, because we have small children with us.   However this evening was hands down terrible!!!! We placed our orders, and it took FOREVER!!! Not even the kids food came out to at least help bide the time we were waiting. When it did finally come out that's when it really took a turn for the worst. My Neice ordered the Mac and cheese. I took a small bite to make sure it wasn't too hot. The dish was lukewarm. It was also supposed to come with a side of applesauce. That didn't bother to show up until we were almost completely done with our meal. My brother in law ordered some wings, there was hardly any sauce on them.  We asked for some additional sauce, that too didn't come till the very end.... An when it did the sauce was straight out of the refrigerator. When we spoke to then manager about our experience ..... the freezing cold sauce in particular, he seemed as if this was common practice. I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1, because our sandwiches were amazing as always. Even though it was quite the wait. And I'm hoping that that this was our server Maria's first day....praying that she gets better over time.",

It wasnt busy, yet it took forever for the waitress to even bring us our drinks.  We stopped because we thought it would be quick to just get 2 kids meals and an appetizer.  Boy were we wrong.  I don't know where the waitress went to each time she left our table, but it took too long for her to come back around again.  When another employee brought out the kids meals and our app, the kids didnt have their sides.  When she asked us if we needed anything else, I asked for the sides they picked.  The lady huffed, rolled her eyes and walked away.  A few minutes later, she returned and said if we needed anything else, our waitress would be by shortly.  The nachos were burnt and we never received silverware.  When we asked for it, the waitress seemed appalled we even asked for it and then brought over one set even though there were 4 of us.   It seemed like the staff was annoyed we weren't ordering alcohol, full meals, etc...It wasn't like we were taking up a table for someone else who was waiting...the place was dead.  You would think she would have been happy to have anything, rather than nothing.",

    "text": "I've been hearing about this place for years and finally made it there today. It was well worth the trip.   While not the original location, this location has a great atmosphere, plenty of TV's and a nice outdoor patio. The service was great even during the busy lunch hour, and they bartender took the time to talk about the menu with a newbie like me.   ... and the sandwich. I now understand all the hype. The bread is great with a thin crunchy crust and a fresh bread so soft you leave finger prints in it. I had the pastrami and cheese (I was in Pittsburgh) and found that it was very flavorful, and not stringy or tough like pastrami can get. The tomato and shredded lettuce was so fresh I think they slice it for each individual sandwich, which they actually might.   Fries on a sandwich is foreign to this Michigan boy, but they are delicious and add a nice texture to the sandwich. Fries on this area (PA - souther Ohio - W. Virginia) are... 1) put on everything, including salads; 2) have the skins on and are cut a little thinner than McD's. The skin crisps up a little, but the rest of the fry stays soft.   The coleslaw on the sandwich is... all I can say is Bravo. Not overly dressed, it adds a distinct sweetness I haven't tasted anywhere else. I love my vinegar/Italian dressing/mustard on my sandwiches, any of which were not needed and would actually have ruined the whole thing.   I now know why this is a Pittsburgh institution. I am proud to award it my 5 Napkin Award, with all the rights and privileges that go with it.",

It was around 45 minutes from the time we ordered until we actually got our food. Pretty ridiculous for a few sandwiches and a salad.

I ordered the Sicilian cheesesteak and it was good enough, but nothing special. It came with a side of fries which were pretty pedestrian as well.

I was concerned there would be no seats insude, but I was still able to find a place at the bar.   It's a very loud and fun type of place with a big crowd looking to have a good time. There are a lot of screens around, but the patrons seemed more focused on drinking, socializing and having a good time.   The draft beer selection was fairly basic. I had a Yuengling draft. Service was a little slow at first, but after I ordered my food, it came real fast.   Please be advised the sandwiches are huge.  I got the roast beef and cheese, which was really good and very filling. However, I don't really care for fries and cole slaw in the sandwich.  It was interesting to try this Pittsburgh specialty, but I wouldn't want to eat that type of and which on a regular basis.   I'm giving this place four stars for the festive atmosphere, big portions, reasonable prices and value for the money, but I think the menu is a little too limited for me--mainly just sandwiches, pizza and appetizers, but no True dinner entrees.",

While the restaurant was full when we came in about 9, few additional patrons came in from that point on.  Seating was slow and uninterested.  Having an order taken was slower and even more uninterested.  After verifying our orders three times over the next 55 minutes, everything we ordered had something wrong.  Wrong bread, wrong cheese, wrong side.  We ate and left feeling like any other action would waste more time with little assistance expected from the slow and uninterested.  We didn't expect miracles, but the treatment, wait, lack of waitstaff skills, and wrong orders did not make for a good time.",

Went late (as they seem to be open daily until midnight which is nice!) on Father's Day and was pleasantly surprised that while I spent the day traveling for work away from my kids & family, that they had a free sandwich promo for dads!! Had a beer and burger for $6.50.  Burger was a little slow for a relatively quiet evening at roughly 25 minutes, but it was pretty good for a bacon burger. Juicy and well dressed with perfectly crisp bacon! LOVE THE FRESH CUT POTATO FRIES! Nothing better than perfectly cooked, dirty cut fries.   Plenty of screens and sports. If you want high brow gourmet - stay away, if you want a solid restaurant burger and fries for $6...come 'n get it!",

Unless of course, you were born and raised in Western PA, then I'm guessing you'd award 4-5 stars for the sandwich that everyone around here is eating.    Spoiler alert for the rest of you, it's just not that good.  Two pieces of plain white bread, with a thin layer of meat (corned beef, pastrami & capicola are the crowd favorites), cheese, plain coleslaw, a pile of french fries (yes, french fries) and a tomato slice between them.  Just blah, layered on top of blah, layered on top of blah.  The meatball sub is actually pretty good.  The chili is very good, but spicy, so get the cheese, onions and sour cream to tame the beast.    Limited beer selection, but great prices and I'd never complain about an ice cold 22oz Yuengling Black & Tan.  Good sangria, too!",

And, while Primanti Brothers continues to grow and become more than a local chain the quality hasn't been compromised. Instead, the same sandwiches that made this place famous on the  Food Network continue to pace growth.   What I like about this location is it stays open late even when most of the other area restaurants have been closed for hours. And, while most of the people here after 10pm are drinking in the bar the kitchen remains open late for those looking for a bite, like me. And, you can't beat their incredible happy hour prices. Or, the TVs that litterer the inside so we can watch sporting events.   I still haven't embraced their pizzas, or the wings, but continue to chow down on the sandwiches (sorry, I'm never trying the sardine and cheese though!). There's an endless amount of meats available and definitely something for everyone although I'm partial to the turkey, corned beef, pastrami, sweet sausage and the cheese. If you're going to get the fries as a side sometimes it's a good idea to ask for them to be cooked well done. Most of the time, otherwise, they tend to be too mushy to eat.",

    "text": "I was told that this place from fellow yelpers that Primanti Bros is a Pittsburgh institution, so I really had to try it just because I was a tourist from Hawaii and on my way out of Pittsburgh on a jet plane a few hours later. I made a lunch date here before hitting the airport.  Primanti Bros started out in 1933 in the heart of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the strip District. Since it's humble beginnings in the northeast, this franchise has blossomed into the institution dad Pittsburgh citizens know I love today. It has been featured on TV shows through The Channel and food network and is definitely the darling of the entire city of Pittsburgh PA. I arrived here on a nice casual Wednesday on a late September day around 1 PM and The restaurant was not really that busy, so I was seated right away. You could tell you were in Pittsburgh PA, just because there was couple of Pittsburgh Steelers banners hanging up in the restaurant. I knew I was in Steelers country already, especially because I was in Miami dolphin fan. But that didn't bother me one bit. I ended up staying here about 45 minutes from ordering to paying the bill, and the results here were pretty darn good and delicious. I did enjoy the service, which was friendly and quick. I'm glad I did not wear any Miami dolphins gear that day, or else I would have gotten dirty looks. Maybe. Maybe not.  The overall experience here at Primanti Bros was quite nice and very bar restaurant like. While I would have liked to have indulged in a few rounds of beer, the better part of me told me otherwise. So, I opted for some soda pop which was in the form of Dr Pepper. It was pretty cool that there was free refills of soda so I ended up getting three refills along with the original order. The restaurant is very clean and very mysterious in a lot of levels just because of the fact that it is a bar and I'm sure it has many stories to tell. Well I would have loved to stay and listen to many of the stories, my experience here was just lunch and I would never have thought I would have been here, if it had not been from advice from fellow Pittsburgh yelpers. Thanks y'all! This Primanti Bros location is located at 4501 Steubenville Pike in Pittsburgh, PA. It's definitely near the Pittsburgh international airport, which you can stop by here for a quick bite before hopping that flight out of Pittsburgh, which I happened to do. There is private parking here, and plenty of it when I was here. While I realize this place is popular, the parking spaces that were already filled up is a testament to why this place is popular. The prices here are decently good, especially for sandwiches! The menu had a lot of good options, but I opted for just the basic sandwich and fries.  I ended up getting the Cajun chicken Sandwich, double meat. That ended up to be about $10 for the meal. Add 4 rounds of Dr Pepper and you have one hell of a calorie bomb that was sure to impress! The sandwich was decently good, although the bread didn't do much for me. It was impressive that the Sandwich presented itself tall and mighty. At the end of the day, it was meant to be eating and eating well. It was definitely delicious although I thought I had expected a little bit better. But still it was decently good. While I would like to have tried other sandwiches, I most likely would have to save it for another visit to Pittsburgh. The french fries were ingrained in the sandwich so they weren't on the side like most other places that serve burgers and fries. I thought that was kind of interesting and weird at the same time, but that's how they are. Being that they are a Pittsburgh institution, I would recommend checking them out, but however to try some of their sandwiches before making a decision, as usual.  Hard to say whether I like this place as a five-star experience, being that I am a Miami fan and they are definitely a Pittsburgh fan. I will have to say, 3.5 stars for the ambiance and 4,0 stars for the meal. The service was 4.0 stars and the restaurant was clean and organized. Check em out in Steelers country.  Support local!  B",

I have personally been eating at their various locations for 20+ years.  They offer large portions with reasonable prices. The food is nothing amazing but it's good. The signature item is the sandwich. It's made on two slices of thick sliced Italian bread with fries, cole slaw, and your choice of meat.  The #2 best seller is listed as the cheesesteak. It's kind of an inside joke as the cheesesteak is a crappy steak burger patty.  The locals mostly order roast beef, or my favorite capicola.  If you're really hungry you can add a fried egg. If it's lunch time you can also order a slice of pizza, slices are not available after lunch.  Anyway, if you're visiting the burg' I highly recommend you try it at least once. It's loud and kid friendly and great if your here on vacation or visiting relatives.",

Boyfriend asked for a steak sandwich, for something different and had to wait even longer for his actual sandwich to come.   Sandwiches were pretty big, I got the corn beef and it was good, fries inside. Might not come back unless I needed a big ass sandwich randomly lol. But we were in Pittsburgh all the way from Toronto, Canada so why not!",

We had onion rings they were a bit greasy but good. The dipping sauce was different not bad. Our son had the double meat pastrami with fries and coleslaw on side he really liked it. My husband had the bologna with no coleslaw he really liked the bread said the bologna was salty but good. Server was very nice.",

I was debating between their \"number 2\" fav sandwich and pastrami sandwich and I went for the pastrami.....and....I was NOT impressed at all. Maybe cause it was take out or maybe cause the sandwich is too blend or the bread is wayyyyy to soft to hold all the food together....but it wasn't good at all.   The side salad was TINY. I mean I know it was only 1.99 but it was such tiny salad but it was good and fresh....better than the sandwich for sure. My favorite part about the meal was the pickle I ordered but maybe if I try the food at the restaurant, it might be better? Because even the fries were stale. I really wanted to love this place so I can tell all my friends about it......but it was just a huge disappointment",

The portions are GIGANTIC, and that is an understatement.   We coincidentally came here during a Pittsburgh Pirates hockey game, and it was packed! Everyone was sporting their jerseys, but coming from Texas, hockey isn't a big deal to us. Regardless of the sports on TV, the sandwiches really live up to the hype. Piled high with pastrami, corned beef, pulled pork, steak, or whatever meat your heart desires, there is something everyone will love. The signature coleslaw and french fries on the sandwich really complete the whole meal. It was nice that we came during happy hour too, so half off drinks Mon-Fri 5-7pm.  Our only complaint was that service was pretty slow. We ordered at 6:30pm but they almost didn't give us happy hour prices just because the waitress took a long time to even put in our order. But once the food came out, we were happily satisfied. I highly recommend Primanti Bros to others visiting from out of town!",

I tried the classic New Yorker sandwich which included pastrami, corned beef, mustard, coleslaw, and fries. It was a hefty sandwich, and I was stuffed even after only eating half of the thing.   Come by from 5-7 PM for half off drinks for happy hour. I tried their Long Island which was fairly strong. We also got an order of the nachos for a starter and it, too, was a hefty but tasty appetizer.   One star down for somewhat of a slower pace of service. It was a busy night with the first hockey game of the season airing, so it was somewhat understandable.",

My family has lived in the area for 25+ years and somehow this was my dad's first time (granted he has been working overseas for most of that time). He loved it!  Now, if you are like me and kind of hate coleslaw, you may hesitate on trying the famous sandwiches, which come stacked with fries and coleslaw. However this is not the overly mayonnaise smothered coleslaw that has been sitting out at the summer bbq all day. It's more of a vinaigrette based slaw. But if that doesn't make a difference to you, just take it out and eat it with fries because you can't go wrong with fries. The bread is something to be desired, I think this sandwich could be elevated with a more robust bread, but a hearty sandwich overall.  There are plenty of other items on the menu too, so you'll find something I'm sure.",

The chain restaurant is known for the hearty sandwiches stuffed with fries and coleslaw. I ordered a Pitts-burger (one of their many sandwiches stuffed with fries and coleslaw) and I was not disappointed by all the hype around the restaurant.  Note to non-Pitttsburgh natives: the menu at Primanti Bros claims that the Pitts-burger is the #2 best seller. This is an inside joke regarding Iron City Beer being the #1 seller. (So don't get confused like I did and search the menu for a ridiculous amount of time looking for the #1 best seller that did not exist.)  The service at the restaurant was great but a little slow.",

We ordered the pastrami, and had to get the fries on top because I wanted the whole experience. Lots of fries, not a lot of meat. The bread, as stated by just about every other review, is not sturdy enough to hold all the ingredients, especially once you add the (delicious) cole slaw on top.   I guess my question is:  if you've built your business creating sandwiches that steelworkers could grab a meal and eat all at once...why serve it on bread that doesn't stand up to the juices?  Granted, this isn't the purpose of the restaurant anymore, but I'd think they would at least have bread that could hang.",

Interesting wing flavors.. however: why no buffalo hot?  There was only chipotle and xx hot ?     I love hot and spicy food and ordered the xxhot - they were hot but meh ..

I got a pastrami sandwich with double meat and egg. It was kind of spicy which I like. It was nice and hot and the French fries on the sandwich were nice too.   The place is like and average restraint with a bar. A nice environment. The service was pretty average and the time to get our food was as well. I would recommend this for people to try. I enjoyed my time there and was stuffed by the time I left without spending too much money at all.",

It's your typical Primanti experience, with the typical Primanti fare.   I have never had a problem with service, and actually usually have a great waitress that is usually attentive (or as attentive as you can be in a busy restaurant).  My favorites to get though are the Pastrami and cheese, the Capi and Cheese (sometimes i get crazy and put an egg on top of it), and the Pitts-burger. What I love about the sandwich(s) though is that tangy slaw. Literally tastes good on everything. I tend to enjoy the wings as well. Enough to usually share with someone else and still have room to eat half of my sandwich.  I have ordered online before and it was generally an ok experience. The place was packed so I had to wait a little while but I have no problem doing that.",

I ordered the cajun chicken \"almost famous\" sandwich with an extra egg and onions, and the coleslaw, fries, etc. were as expected, however the chicken was crunchy, which was horrendous. It looked like it was cooked, but I think this is a new issue of \"woody breast\" that stems from larger chickens. Definitely not appetizing, and I would definitely avoid the chicken here, and go with beef or a hamburger patty in the sandwiches. What a disaster.",

    "text": "When I think primanti brothers I think of the original, in the strip district, with years of history behind it. Imagine my surprise when I came across a full fledged restaurant on Steubinville Pike...  I thought ahh, another one to dot this city. But I was amazingly surprised at the full menu. Of course they serve the signature sandwich with the flies and cole slaw, but they also serve a colossal variety of pasta dishes, pizza, steaks, burgers etc.   Upon finding this place I made the infamous Pittsburgh U-turn and went in for lunch. As a veg, I could have ordered a salad just to enjoy a meal. Talking to the very helpful, and beautiful waitress, Andrea, she suggested a pizza without cheese, loaded with veggies. So I ordered  a small (6 cut) with mushrooms, onions, peppers, and black olives. What a great idea, never thought of that. And it was really good. Excellent pizza crust, chewy, crunchy, and yeasty. Good sauce not too sour or sweet. The vegetable were crisp tender. Basically I was eating an open-faced veggie Stromboli without cheese. Andrea stopped by a few times to refill my lemonade, and asked how I liked her suggestion. I thoroughly enjoyed my veg pizza, I would suggest they get a veg cheese and put it on the menu! Looking around I saw people eating the lasagna which looked huge, someone ordered spaghetti and meatballs, that looked great too.   It's great to see a Pittsburgh institute grow with the times, and offer great Italian food at good prices.",

We saw the parking lot was completely full on a Tuesday night and knew they must be doing something right.  Come to find out, it's a pretty popular spot here in the area (and they were also running a Tuesday night pizza special.)  I got the black angus sandwich that was recommended to us by the waitress, because we just didn't know where to start.  Everything looked so good!  The sandwich was very unique, I'll give it that!  A steak sandwich with cole slaw, fries (yes, fries!) lettuce and tomato all stuffed between two slices of white, italian bread.  The cole slaw gave it a good touch and I was also just so intrigued by the fries coming ON the sandwich, but midway through, I realized that whole thing was really lacking the flavor and \"kick\" that I was hoping for.  Kind of bland after a while.  Maybe a better, more flavorful bread, or some different spices on the steak and/or fries would put this meal over the top.  Much potential!  On the other hand, my boyfriend got their single 3-topping pizza w/ pepperonis, sausage, and mushrooms and it was absolutely delicious!  If nothing else, we'll be back for the pizza.  Some of the best we've ever had.    Great chili appetizer, too.  Wouldn't go out of my way to get it again, but it did satisfy the taste buds!",

Fresh Mancini's bread, a very tasty coleslaw, fresh cut fries, and tomatoes.  Care to double up the Prim\"anti\"?  Double the meat and add a fried egg.

But this is seriously incredible that this place gets so much attention for what they serve. The atmosphere is great - but this is about food...which was seriously awful. I'm not a picky eater in any sense so it's rare I just flat out don't like something.   I got their signature \"Pittsburger Cheesesteak\" and fried mushrooms. It looked amazing and I already had the mindset that I'd love it, but it was seriously up there in some of the worst meals ever. The burger (not sliced meat) was EXACTLY like the meat that comes in those Smart Ones frozen salisbury steak dinners. I've eaten those a lot so I know...but I never had high hopes for a $1.50 frozen entree. I ate most of it because I hadn't eaten all day, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It wasn't too greasy, it wasn't under/over cooked and it wasn't just short of some seasoning. It was just cheap meat thrown into a stacked sandwich in hopes it would just blend in and not get noticed.   Cleveland has Panini's which is much like this place but way better and fresher food. It would be one thing if I didn't enjoy the combo of everything on it and I always take into account if the place was having one of those off nights - but it wasn't poorly prepared/cooked, it was just bad quality.",

We had the Kielbasa and the corned beef. Excellent! The price is very reasonable for what you you are getting as well. Be ready for a nap!! Truly a must when in Pittsburgh which I must say is quite picturesque. I will definitely be back to this city!!",

Because the kitchen is in the back, it doesn't have the oil-soaked feeling of the Oakland location. The wait staff is fast, friendly, and efficient, and always check on our party frequently. The menu is also larger; my wife can't help but order their pizza every time we visit.  The sandwiches are still good; bread, fries, slaw, meats. As I have said elsewhere, some of the meats are hit or miss; if you find a good one, like the kielbasa, get double meat and really have something great.",

    "text": "I was just visiting Pittsburgh and I never been to the city before so I came here because everyone said that Primanti Brothers is a rite of passage.  So I went.  HISTORY:  The original one is located in the Pittsburgh Strip District, a really busy area along with the Allegheny River which are dotted with warehouses and produce yards.  The owner, Joe Primanti, invented his famous sandwich during the Great Depression.  This spawned all kinds of sandwiches and the restaurant became a stop for late-night and early-morning workers.  For decades, it was a big food stop for truck drivers. Because they usually had to get their burgers or sandwiches to go, the restaurant started putting the fries inside the burgers and sandwiches so they can eat their entire meal with ease while driving. That eventually became their signature piece for all their sandwiches. Even though it's an eatery for all and is a foodery stop for everyone crazy about the Burgh, the original Primantis still keeps it's super large parking lot for truck drivers to make their routine stop for food. Pittsburgh is a working class city who loves (LOVES) their sports so Primanti Brothers is an insanely popular place to pre or post-game or to game-game while eating and drinking. It's now a chain that is all throughout the east coast but in Pittsburgh it's a staple.  Whenever TV stations (notably ESPN) do an expose on the city, Primanti Brothers is always mentioned, visited and spotlighted.  FOOD: Heavy. They put their fries inside their burger. Um, I guess that's a novelty but conceptually it's like a turducken. Kind of too much.  But excess is the theme of all their signature burgers and sandwiches or you can custom-make your excess.  Add more fries, sauces, an egg, double up on meat, combine different kinds of meat.  Mention the word diet and everyone will look at you as if you're from California, which in this case, is True. But the restaurant, per their menu, states that their sandwiches are only the number 2 favorite.  The title of number one favorite goes to beer.  Not a particular kind.  Just beer in general.  Smile.  SERVICE: Incredibly friendly and they love the question \"What's your favorite?\" to which the answer will, again, be beer.  Another smile.  Tell them you're new and just visiting Pittsburgh, they'll relish the opportunity to fill you in on not just the favorites of the menu but their personal favorites in the city at large.  CONSENSUS:  Definitely not a place to eat if you're dieting, paleo or vegan unless it's a cheat day or you relapse into the world of meat.  But if you can appreciate the hearty sports bar fanfare, you'll find yourself at home here with your stomachs full.  The restaurant, itself, is very welcoming and the bar area is incredibly social, especially if there is a game playing.  As a visiter of the city as a whole, I don't know if this is characteristic to the restaurant or the city as a whole, but, regardless, I will swing by again when I have business in Pittsburg in the future.  I'll just make sure that it is also a cheat day.",

I called my lunch in and asked if I could get it to go but eat it there since I may be short on time. The bartender, who I later found out was the person that took my order was a little snotty about me wanting them to have it made ahead of time. Almost made me feel like I was doing something wrong. Meh... Whatever. The rest of the staff were great ad I still enjoyed my lunch. For the bartender... I am going to drop it a star. I was going to give it four. It's difficult to get a five from me. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and want to eat like a local!  :)",
