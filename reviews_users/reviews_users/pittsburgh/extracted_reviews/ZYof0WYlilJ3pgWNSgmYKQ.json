You won't find the most craft selection here though, but that's not their style. You come here for deliciously thin and greasy pizza and to catch whatever game they have on. I'd recommend the buffalo chicken sub - it comes with buffalo fries on it. And a full size  sub clocks in around 18 inches.",

    "text": "I've been ordering from Milanos for years. I lived on campus at Duquesne University and they were a quick and delicious delivery. When I lived on campus, the delivery guy NEVER came to my building. I had to walk down to the parking lot to get my food. Which is 1/3 of the way to walking to the place so why spend ~ $5 on delivery? On so many occasions they've messed up the order and made the process to fix the order so difficult. Normally we don't call and we eat it anyway. Tonight we ordered two items at 10:02 and should have been here by 10:42. As we anxiously and hungrily waited for the late food, it arrived and the delivery guy was surprisingly VERY kind. We take it inside and the one item was completely wrong. We call and spend forever on hold. It is now 11:20 and we're still waiting for a delivery guy to come BACK to pick the hoagie up and then deliver the correct one. I am also not expecting a refund unfortunately. The food is decent and milanos will always stay in business because of locals and the students. I really wish they'd change their service because I love the food! Too expensive for inaccurate orders and rude staff",

They don't rip you off on the most expensive ingredient of the pizza.  Another reason why I love this place is because they are open late throughout the week.

The vegetables on the pizza were a little too big and kept falling off the pizza. They could have been cooked a little more. I tend to like the bottom of my pizza to be a little crunchier. It was a little on the flimsy/ floppy side. My brother definitely enjoyed it more than I did. The salad was good, but it was just iceberg lettuce and I had a few lettuce cores in there (not the best). The Italian dressing was good. My sister liked her Greek salad. The food was pretty quick, so it's a good spot if you are in a hurry for lunch. The staff was friendly.",

It's your standard freezer to fryer fair and the pizza while at times is good, normally suffers from being over loaded with cheese and under-cooked.

Walk across the street, grab some grub and a drink and celebrate a win or a loss, or relive the concert you just saw.

The female who answered the phone was rude, no hello, thank you and goodbye. She said the delivery time was 40 mins.  The guy got here in 20 mins and of course I was in the shower and had to dry up and go down to pick up the pizza.   How can the pizza get done so quick yet has so much oil that wet half of the box??  This is my guess...  Old cheese pizza by the slice added pepperoni and some more cheese and warmed up with some oil for the crunch but not really that warm.  The fat on the pepperoni did not even turn translucent!!!  Not cooked.  When you take out the cheese, the dough is not done well and it was dry in top.    Next the shrimp pizza by the slice review... Now shrimp was translucent and cheese was not completely melted.  What did that tell you?  shrimp was not well done, cheese topping was not cooked but warmed enough to start releasing oil.  Dump ass me ate some anyway.  Not good!!!  Spinach and mushroom white pizza had uneven dough, and super oily.  Not good.  I throw them out.  I didn't enjoy any of it.  Found it funny with the time line.  Ordered at 10:40pm.  Told it would take 40 min and got hang up by that girl.  Pizza deliver at 11:03pm while I was in the shower.  Picked up the pizza ate some of it and I have a stomach ache at 12:03am.   I had better pizza at Pizza Hut",

Then after we're finished our beer she just does not bother coming back around because she was too busy chatting to one group sitting at the bar.  I would understand if it was busy but the bar was nearly empty.  All around terrible customer service.  Will not be returning here, way too many other great bars.

The pizza tastes like a greasy mix of Pizza Hut deep dish and puffy DiGiorno's self-rising frozen.  I needed about 14 napkins for the two slices I ate.  Yeah, THAT greasy.  Almost like it was fried.  The cheese is Provolone (Where's the Mozzarella?) which is oddly common in this region?  Crust was very chewy.  Overall, not that good.     Honestly, this is mainly a place for Duquesne College kids and Pens fans to pre/post game it.

Upon his arrival to our building, the delivery man proceeded to rapid fire call my phone to the point where you would have thought someone was in crisis.  Upon picking up, he informed me that he was outside.  I had already notified them that I was on the third floor.  I asked him to please come up and was met with an attitude.  After getting back into my office, I quickly realized that they had neglected to deliver the soup that I had ordered.  As anyone would do, I called them in hopes of having him run it back to me.  I explained my issue to two different people, who then immediately placed me on hold.  When person #3 picked up...who was apparently a manager...I explained the issue again, but this time requesting that my soup charge be returned to my card.  The response was \"So what's the problem?\" and another place on hold.  I hung up at this point, because my sanity was worth more than the $5 I was trying to get back from them.  Part of me feels that it is a purposeful stint to get people to hang up so they don't have to own up to their mistakes.  I will NOT be a return customer.  The owner/employees really need to educate themselves on good customer service because it was seriously lacking...and the food wasn't that great either.",

Pizza Milano is the kind of place that reminds me that, yeah, times are hard and things are bad right now, but, America still has a chance--We can do this.  There is no aspect of Pizza Milano for which I would have the audacity to even consider trying to propose an improvement.  The beer selection is unassailable; the pizza is other-worldy; and I, frankly, get a little emotional sitting here reflecting on how that Labatt looks/feels/tastes through all enchanting aspects of the tap-to-pitcher-to-glass-to-mouth process.  Breath taking.  And then there's the non-food, intangible, aspects for which no Yelp review will be able to do even a scrap of justice...  The staff was some of the nicest, most courteous, and thoughtful restauranteurs with whom I have ever had the pleasure of sitting down and turning up.  At Olive Garden, when you're there, you're family...  At Pizza Milano, when you're there, you're some sort intrinsically spiritual combination of Tunnel Buddy/Foxhole Companion/Siamese Twin, that I can't even really describe (without tearing up, of course).  At any rate, I could go on, but, suffice it to say...  Pizza Milano is my Pittsburgh destination for refreshments and fellowship, and I think it should be yours.  I personally guarantee that Pizza Milano will change your life.  Thank you.",

    "text": "Stopped at this place before a Pens playoff game this year. The place was packed as expected, but it didn't take too long to get a seat, pizza and a few beers in before the game.   The seating and ordering situation there is unique though. There is no hostess, so you have to roam and find seats as they open. We shared our table with 4 people altogether. The first 2 left shortly after we got our beer and the other 2 filled their spot shortly before our pizza was ready. Good way to make new friends.   You have to place your pizza order and pay at the counter, then wait for your number to be called. There is no waitstaff. The bar is on the other side of the room, and even when packed, it's easy to get the bartenders attention and order your drinks.  The pizza was good and fairly priced, so was the beer. Medium pizza was more than enough for 2 people. I would definitely stop here again next season.",

The delivery driver threw a fit when I refused to tip him because he hadn't followed my simple delivery instructions (which has resulted in me never getting delivery on various previous orders, so it's important).  He wouldn't give me my pizza, demanded a tip, and we felt threatened.  I explained calmly that I was sorry, but following the instructions was very important, because of the issues that can and do arise.  He ignored me, and kept demanding a tip.  He acted like he had done me a favor by even being willing to deliver my pizza (You're a delivery driver.  That's your job).  Finally, I took the pizza from him, said \"Take care,\" and closed the door in his face (not much choice given his forceful proximity).  He then CALLED ME using the cell phone on file.  Talk about a privacy violation!  I didn't answer, of course.  Then, he texted me, yelling at me.  He sent me multiple texts over the next few hours, all extremely rude.  I was polite, but firm.  I even gave him the out of saying I was going to assume he was just having a bad night, but he just kept on.  Clearly, that's just how he is.  And, he was literally the rudest delivery person I've EVER dealt with.  In Pittsburgh, that's saying something.  The food isn't worth it.  Go somewhere else.  There's no reason to pay to be harassed.  One more call or text, and we'll be making a report to the police.",

When I told this to the woman who answered the phone, she didn't seem to think that to be a problem.  I placed my order.  It was for one large sub.  I was told that it would be 45 minutes, which was no problem.  I was on a conference call for work and received two phone calls from two numbers that I did not know.  Since they were unknown numbers, I did not feel the need to pick them up during the work call.  Once my work call was finished, I called back one of the numbers and it was Pizza Milano.  They told me that the delivery man was at my house.  I explained that I was in my living room, a mere 15 feet from my front door, and no one had come.  She said she wasn't going to argue with me and put her supervisor on.  The supervisor told me that their drivers are from Uzbekistan and Turkey and that they are shy.  They call you from their cars instead of knocking on your door.  I told them that it would be in their best interests to explain to their deliverymen, regardless of where they are from, that they need to knock on the door and not call.  They made this out to be my fault and agreed to refund my money.  The people working there are clueless.  Great customer service indeed!  I am sorry, but I have no choice but to give this establishment 1 star.  I would give them zero if I could.",

I ordered a supreme steak gourmet hoagie without onions due to being allergic.  My food arrived within the promised 30 minutes.  Unfortunately, upon opening my sandwich, I found it full of onions. I called back and explained my order was incorrect.   The woman in the phone said  a new sandwich would be sent to me.  I meet the driver in the lobby a second time and he assures me my food was correct.  Wrong! This time they sent me a steak hoagie, not the supreme one I ordered.  My third call was to request my credit card be credited because,  I was fed up with trying to get food from this place.  The manager was so disrespectful, referring to me as \"honey\".  He refused to refund my money because I wouldn't dig the sandwiches out of the garbage can and return them to his driver.  He expected me to get them out of the trash and go downstairs a third time. I have never been treated so poorly by an establishment.  I worked in the restaurant business for over 20 years. This is not how you treat customers, especially when you don't deliver what is promised.",

The pizza tasted good and I would recommend it is as a quick go to spot when on that side of the city. Though I recall that it gets quite lively during Pens games which is a fun atmosphere.   It has a bar side and a dining side. You can sit at the bar and order a pint/food, dine in the dining area or get it to go. They have about 8 beers on tap and others in bottle/can. The selection was decent. Salads are generous portions and priced well; ordered the $10.99 antipasto salad for the 3-person group and it easily portioned out to 4 salads as an accompaniment for another item. Glad to have this one in the neighborhood for a pizza fix.",

    "text": "A really nice option close to work that co-workers introduced me to. Every few weeks I stop by for one of their lunch specials.  Typically the half hoagie, fries and a drink for $10.99. The half hoagie is plenty as they are huge. I've had the Buffalo Chicken, Italian, Steak and most recently the Seafood. All were good aside from the Steak. It was fairly dry and needed something more.  I really like the Buffalo Chicken and Seafood. The Chicken has good heat and the put waffle fries on it.  The Seafood has a nice garlic butter sauce on it.  I always ask for Buffalo fries with my order.  Regular fries come with the platter normally but if you ask, they will give you the Buffalo fries.    I have not personally ordered the pizza yet but have tried a piece from when my friend ordered it. It's pretty good! I'm going to have to place an order at some point.  Overall I'd like to give the place a five stars but I've never thought much of the service here. They just kind of rush you through the order process then call your number when it's ready. It's not bad service but nothing above and beyond either.",

    "text": "I don't write this post with any pleasure, and I hope management uses this as constructive criticism for the bar and restaurant. Also, in full disclosure, I have been cut off from drinking by bartenders before and even kicked out a time or two in my younger days, and I can tell you in each of those instances I deserved it.  Pizza Milano's is a two-story bar located right next to the arena downtown, an outstanding university, and one of the bigger African American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It should be a lively establishment that serves great pizza, boozes up the casual sports fans who couldn't make it inside the arena for a game, and accommodate the diversity that surrounds them.  I stopped by Pizza Milano's on St. Patrick's Day Saturday around noon time with about 7 of my friends who are all Duquesne graduates. We are all responsible adults in our 30s, and I was pacing myself to make sure I didn't over drink as I cannot stand hangovers and have Memorial Day goals for my body. Even though my tab showed that I ordered 2 pitchers of green Bud Light and some wings, none of the 8 of us were drunk at any point of the 3.5 hours we were in that establishment, and I had the least amount to drink out of all of us as I shared everything I ordered. We were there to ourselves, and we were there to enjoy each other's company, listen to music, and watch the basketball games that were happening across the street while eating food and having a few beers. (By the way, none of us enjoyed the selection of music we could choose from TouchTunes. They filtered out Drake, Kanye, Jay-Z, and anyone the establishment felt would bring \"that type of crowd\".)  Midway through the Duke - Rhode Island game, one of the bartenders started to collect our empty cans and glasses. At the time, I thought that she was being polite as I even said \"thank you\" to her while I was sitting down texting someone on my phone. After collecting everything, the server told one of my friends that she recommended us to go. One of my other friends questioned this, and he went to the bar to ask all the bartenders why we were getting kicked out. Paraphrasing, one of the bartenders then said something on the lines of, \"no, no, no. We are not asking you to leave. Just the guy in the green hoodie.\"  And of course I'm the only black guy in the building, wearing a green hoodie of my alma mater (Great season Gators...tough loss against Texas Tech.)  To be transparent, I never talked to the bartenders when all of this was going down as sometimes it is best to walk away, but I understood what was going down based on my friends' reactions, being livid at the bartenders and encouraging me and each other to provide them $0 for a tip. After paying for their \"services\", we walked next door to Shale's, where I felt welcomed and enjoyed great tasting beverages while continuing to discuss basketball with my friends.  I don't write this to get revenge on Pizza Milano. I'm a businessman that completely understands that a business has a right to makes its own decisions and  that social media can destroy a business. If there is a business decision that was made where I felt cheated and wronged, I have always discreetly addressed the problem with a manager and never blasted the entity on social media. Nine times out of ten, the problem gets fixed, and I show my appreciation by continuing to be a regular customer and tipping well (by the way, everyone knows I tip well. I have customer service job today. I understand how hard it is, and for being in the place for one and a half basketball games, I was going to tip more than 25% to show my appreciation when signing my check.)  I was not aware before my visit to Pizza Milano yesterday that they made the local news a few months back when a manager beat a woman of opposite color on camera. I try my damnedest not to see color when talking to people or visiting a bar or working for an entity as love has no color. But I truly want management to understand how violated I feel. I'm from Alabama. I have been involved in plenty of awkward situations living in the South for 26 years, but it's been an awfully long time since I have felt this violated due to the color of my skin.  I write this review in the hopes of you fixing this problem. You make good late night pizza, and you are in a predominantly African American neighborhood. You can obtain much more business by accommodating the folks that are around you.  Businesses are people too according to current interpretation of the law, with all of the rights and freedoms that individuals have, and you have the right to play whatever music you want and serve whomever you want in your establishment. I also have the right to do everything I possibly can to make sure that everyone I talk to do not give another dime to your establishment ever again until the owner and manager addresses this, and the community you do business in, appropriately.",

I witnessed first hand how terrible these people are yesterday. There was a group of 8 of us hanging out and watching basketball, drinking light beer and enjoying the day. This woman came over to our table, whispered in the ear of another friend and pointed out the one guy in our group (who happens to be a black man) telling him we should go soon because your buddy had too much to drink. His bar tab was $20 as he bought 2 pitchers of beer to share for the table, and an order of wings. In disbelief, i approached the bar and asked for my check. I asked them are we being kicked out for some reason? She said no no not you guys, but your friend in the green hoody should leave as he drank too much. I was so upset and said to them that they know exactly the reasoning. The man was sitting at the table texting and in complete control! He has a masters degree and is a hard working professional, but you're kicking him out because he's black. I left $0 and told every person they should be ashamed of themselves.    Please do not support this racist business. I'm very upset about how they treated my friend, and will do everything in my power to prevent people from going here. I hate to be like this, but these people deserve it.",

We work in customer service and no matter what, the behavior he displayed would not be tolerated here with a customer. I was astonished and disgusted that pizza Milano (whom we order from frequently) employees such a disgraceful person. After he became belligerent, he was asked NUMEROUS times to leave and was told to leave by an employee of mine until he finally left. Not worth the pizza for this type of treatment by a business.

When I spoke to the manager, he said that someone called from my phone number and canceled the order, but I could place it again either online or with him. I said that was impossible because I haven't used my phone to make a call since Wednesday and why would I order again if some random woman can just call and cancel it. Additionally, the story from the manager did not match the one the woman I spoke to gave (about the delivery driver calling and no one answering). I get that people make mistakes, but I did not appreciate that I was blamed for a situation that was clearly not my fault, my receipt is in my inbox, my phone has no calls except the two I made to Milano's to rectify the situation, the money is still pending out of my acct (which will take up to FOUR days to be returned), and I'm still hungry. I am appalled at the way this was handled and I don't know that I will be returning for quite some time.   BEWARE when ordering online - someone can apparently just call and cancel your order without confirming any information and when you call to figure out what's going on, they'll find three different excuses to blame it on you. I went to Duquesne - I have gone to Milano's a LOT, and I have never received service the way I did today from the manager. I will not be back.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places for cheap, good food and drink. Milano's is a low key bar across the street from PPG, so it's a great place to stop by before a game, or to watch one. Their prices on drinks are very reasonable. They don't have a large tap selection, but they have a ton of bottled beers in stock. Bartenders are well versed in different drinks, and are quick to try out new ones. They also give NICE sized shots.   The food here is exactly what you'd expect. It's pretty good, nothing amazing, but hey, you're not going to leave disappointed. The food comes relatively fast, even when it's super busy on game days. It can get super packed though, so be mindful of that!  One of my favorite things to get here is the buffalo chicken fries with nacho cheese on them. It's not insanely spicy, but the buffalo is a nice little touch added to it. I have tried some of their 'signature drinks'  before, but personally I'd recommend grabbing a beer. It's going to be a lot cheaper, and the drinks aren't anything special. But if you're looking to get a mixed drink, their prices on liquor are really good.   Good place to go before a game.",

    "text": "After having lunches brought in as I traveled to different offices this week, my expectations were low.  I had packed my fruit in anticipation on not having anything that I would eat - or ordering from a menu with limited options for me.  So when I saw this menu when it was passed to me, my hopes were raised a bit.  There were a couple salads I would have enjoyed.  I hesitated to order the Tuscan Chicken salad as it really sounded too good to be True.  All the things I absolutely love - and not cheap ingredients.  I crossed my fingers and wrote down my order.  The salad had a generous amount of lettuce (iceberg) and toppings.  It was covered with feta cheese, lots of artichoke hearts, roasted peppers, and lots of chicken.  It filled the entire container!  I started by cutting up all the larger pieces so I could keep on eating once I dug in.  I was really impressed with the quality ingredients and very moist, flavorful chicken.  I ordered my salad without dressing and very truly did not miss it. (In a perfect world, I would have oil and vinegar).  I ate every single piece of food, leaving only some stray lettuce so I didn't  look like a total glutton.    That salad was easily the best I've had all year - and I only eat salads when I go out, so that is saying a LOT!  I hope to have the opportunity to return and order this again.  Doubtful, but one can wish!!",

First we started with their loaded fries with cheese and bacon that the waitress recommended. It was huge and really good. We got a medium pizza and it was delicious and more than enough for two people to split.  There's a large beer bottle selection, not as much on tap.

    "text": "It is probably best to go into the restaurant vs calling in an order for delivery because they are incompetent. The only reason for the 3 star instead of 1 or 2 star is because my friends food was good. But, let me start from the beginning.   We called to place an order for 3 salads. The salad I ordered was a small garden salad with NO cheese. This was told to the first young lady on the phone before we were put on hold. The gentleman that got on the phone next and asked how he could help. We said had started placing an order when he replied, \"Yea, she is new and doesn't know what she is doing. What can I get you?\" Once again, we stated a small garden salad with NO cheese and two other salads (for my friends) loaded with French fries and meat. He repeated the order back and it was stressed again NO cheese on the small salad. Great, it will take 40 minutes to deliver. Long time for salads, but no worries.   At exactly 40 minutes the salad was delivered and lo and behold, there was mound after mound of cheese on my salad. I suppose they heard NO cheese three times and felt it necessary to triple up on the cheese. At that time of the night, I was hungry so I scraped off as much as I could and ate it. Good thing I wasn't lactose intolerant because there would be much more to happen than just a 3 star review. Again the only reason for 3 instead of 2 or 1 is because my co-workers salads were good (they said). Mine was okay but how can you mess up an iceberg salad with cucumbers, tomato and onion...oh yea, add tons of cheese. BTW: cheese is an extra charge on some salads.   I certainly would not order from Pizza Milano online again. One shot and your out in my book. I may visit the restaurant myself, but delivery ever again.",

It might seem expensive but this sub can feed two people easily.  Also, make sure to order it with the mild sauce.  Obviously it is not as hot at the regular sauce but the flavor is much better.  There is also a college special for pizza that is the same deal except with a large pizza that can feed 3-4.    They also have a bar and if you are a Duquesne student they have some good specials.  My favorite is the $5 domestic pitchers and $7 import pitchers.  Being able to get 4 pints of Yuengling for $5 is a heck of a deal since Pizza Milano is the only bar choice by Duquesne University.  They also have $5 shot pitchers on most nights from 10-12, again, for Duquesne Students.    Tip: Perfect for a bite to eat before an event at the Consol Energy Center or for a drink after an event if you aren't a fan of gridlocked traffic.",

    "text": "We happened upon this place after asking for suggestions from the desk at the Marriott.  I'm sure that this is just b/c it is NOT hockey season, and b/c it was day light, but this neighborhood looks pretty rough.  I'm glad we were in a group. The location seems clean, and it had that 'pizzeria' feel to it, which was a plus.  We asked the clearly bored girl behind the counter what was good and she just handed us a menu with no other response....  After much discussion we shared a big house salad, with cheese, and a medium pepperoni pizza (for four girls).   The Salad was pretty average, only covered with 1/2 a pound of cheese.  The dressing (italian) was very, very, very oily.   The pizza was promptly delivered, and it was piping hot.  The crust tasted like it had some wheat flour in it, a plus, and the sauce was mildly sweet.  Overall, the pizza was great (as you would hope) but the lack of service and greasy dressing cost them.",

The neighborhood can be a little shady, but if you're at the Consol and are hungry, this is definitely the place to eat.  Now, if you just want a beer, head next door to Shales... Or, head to shales and bring your Milano's pizza... they don't mind a bit!",

    "text": "The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about $2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy/rubbery and pretty bland.",
