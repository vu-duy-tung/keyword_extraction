    "text": "A well done restaurant and something different than the traditional faire.  First the bar, spectacular when it's warm out, great cocktails and enjoyable happy hour.  I find their wines by the glass robe a step above most Pittsburgh joints.  On to dinner, the wine list is good but more over- priced than it should be. Cautious for the classic wine list bait and switch, \"oh sorry out of the '08 but we have the '09.\" which is aggravating considering how much they pump their wine room.  The food though was fantastic.  Seared foie gras was excellent paired with a chocolate bread which was a touch unbalanced but good flavor profile. The lamb was superb joined with roasted garlic and polenta with a cherry tomato aus jus.  The dessert was a lemon poppy seed cake with sorbet which for a dessert lover that shines away from overly sweet this was very refreshing.  The ice wine was good but a rip-off.  Overall a very elegant meal and a good change of pace from the normal Pittsburgh restaurants we frequent.",

I started with the baby kale Caesar salad and had the grilled swordfish as my entree. The grilled swordfish was fantastic. Others entrees at the table were the salmon, pork chop and strozzapreti. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Our waiter was great too. He was extremely friendly and very helpful when it came to our questions about the menu. I would definitely recommend Eleven and planned on returning. Would love to try their brunch next time.",

There was a server for bread service, two for delivering entrees, and someone entirely separate took our order. The cocktails my date and I ordered were top-notch. Splurge and order the barrel-aged Manhattan; they take already delicious Maker's Mark and age it even further in oak barrels. The presentation on the entrees was gorgeous; my carrots and brussels must have been meticulously placed in an artful arrangement on the plate. The food itself was incredibly tasty, though I felt my pork was maybe sliiightly overcooked for my taste. My date's steak tenderloin, however, was probably the best I've ever had. I felt everything was well priced for the level of service and quality of ingredients. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh, this will be a repeat stop because I'm afraid I won't get such a great experience anywhere else.",

    "text": "I ate at Eleven twice on my most recent trip to Pittsburgh.  The first time - I tried the butternut squash bisque and the scallops - both were very good.  It was what I needed after OD'ing on carbs at Primanti's. On my second trip, I went with the lamb taco - normally I am not a fan of lamb - but the fact that it was pulled/shredded intrigued me.  So glad I got it because that has to be one of the best most unique dishes I have had in a awhile.  I love that the ingredients they list are easy to identify - lamb, goat cheese, tomatillo sauce - those flavors work well together.  The shell did not wrap around the taco - it was more on the bottom so I used a fork and knife to eat the taco.  I was craving another one but instead I decided to try dessert. I asked the bartender for some recommendations and ended up getting the tangerine pudding cake - it was platted with a light blackberry sauce and toasted macamedias and had shaved ice cream on top - yummers!  I never would have imagined that coming together - but it was delicious.  The tangerine was sweet and mild - the blackberry was slightly more dominant in flavor.  The pudding cake had a flan like bottom and the shaved ice cream on top made it chill. Eleven has a killer happy hour - 4-6pm which offers a solid selection of wines, mixed drinks, and appies at very reasonable prices. A Super Tuscan at $6 at the end of a work day makes for the start of a very happy evening. The offering of starters, a tavern menu, a fine dining, and tasting menu - makes this place appealling for all sorts of occassions.   I also like that they have valet for $5 - I was driving around earlier and it seems like so many places did not have valet and were charging $10-$15 in downtown for evening parking. The only thing I was not crazy about are the bar chairs - I felt like I was eating at a distance from the bar.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch on Sunday and had the prix fix menu of an appetizer, entree and drink for $25. Normally we don't eat so much but we decided to indulge. That wasn't the best idea. Keep in mind that the portions are a decent size (not huge, but not small either like I had expected) and the food is luxurious. We would have been good with one appetizer and one entree between the two of us. But anyway.  Eleven is beautiful decorated and sticks to the motif of trendy and intimate, which seemed pretty tough to do because of how large the place is. We were seated on the upper level and felt comfortable secluded and never noticed the rest of the patrons. Our waiter was professional, courteous and attentive without being annoying. He also suggested some vegetarian favorites and dishes we could modify. Our food was delicious and even better as leftovers because the flavors had time to kick in. My favorite part of brunch (aside from being with my boo)? The drink I ordered. The First Snowfall was light, refreshing, slightly sweet and it really felt like I was drinking delicate, little snowflakes. It made me really happy.",

    "text": "I came here w/ one of my favorites this past Thursday night; after walking out I can declare Eleven as one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  We made reservations for 7 PM and were promptly seated; most of the crowd seemed to be of an older demographic, the average age in the restaurant was easily at least 20 years older than me.  I walked in with the intention of ordering their four course tasting menu with the wine pairing, but changed my mind the last second because I really wanted to try their Wagyu Beef Carpaccio.  I ended up ordering their Elysian Fields Farm Lamb and she ordered their Heritage Farms Pork (all of the Big Burrito restaurants push the fact that they use sustainable ingredients, as is evident from the fact that the locations where all proteins are sourced are included in the dish names).  The Carpaccio was as good as expected; would I order it again?  Depends on my mood, and who I'm with.  I've realized I have a larger than average-for-an-Asian hankering for raw and cured meats.  I knew if I didn't get their tasting menu I'd be deciding between their lamb and duck dish (my two favorite land-based proteins), but our server told me the lamb was his favorite dish hands down, so I took his word for it and had it medium rare.  I know some people complain about lamb having a \"lamb-y\" taste, but this lamb was well sourced and well cooked with maximum tenderness and flavor without the off-putting flavor of cheaper cuts of meat.  The roasted root vegetables had just the perfect bite; not too soft which would result in mushiness and not too hard from being undercooked.  The polenta was absolutely delicious and paired perfectly with both the protein and the vegetable.  The pork was a giant chop served on the bone, cooked to a suggested medium rare.  The taste of well sourced ingredients is especially evident when it comes to protein as animals raised outside the typical inhumane dark and cramped living conditions have a richer flavor with a better mouthfeel.  The sliced sweet potatoes were cooked well but their texture didn't resonate with me as a perfect match with the crunchiness of the apple strips and the meatiness of the pork.  Everything else was spot on though.  For dessert we split their banana cream pie.  The deconstructed pie came with house-made banana graham crackers topped with dulce de leche mousse with a banana brulee on the side.  The graham crackers were a bit crunchier than expected but were perfect to cut the sweetness and creaminess of the mousse.  The banana brulee itself of course was a wonderful textural experience with the caramelized exterior of the banana cutting into the sweetness of the soft fruit.  When you do go to Eleven, make sure you are in the mindset and mood to eating simple yet elegantly prepared quality food.  Food doesn't taste as good when you're distracted and the dishes Eleven serves up are worthy of your full attention.",

Being that the city is pretty busy with hockey fans trying to get dinner before the Winter Classic I had no idea where to even start to look for a place to eat. Google maps said that there was a place to eat within sight of my hotel lobby - that would work.  Walking in it looked VERY upscale and it was too early for the dining room, but we could eat in the bar area. Given that we were already in hockey fan gear that was a more comfortable environment anyway.  The food was perfect, very tasty soft pretzels and they had Blue Coat gin which I am always in search for.  The only reason that I could not give Eleven five stars is that once we had our food the service seemed to disappear.  While we wanted a casual meal we did have a only a short time before we had to head to the stadium. The delay in getting our check and getting on our way kind of tarnished the overall experience to that point. Maybe it was the fact that we were not for the home team.  In the end I would eat there again if I was even in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "A weak 4 star, imo. Some dishes are excellent, while others are fairly ordinary. Given that it is a pricy restaurant (most entrees are around $30, most wine glasses are north of 12), this is a disappointment.   There are several better, less expensive high-end restaurants in Pittsburgh, such as Spoon and Legume. I'll go to these, and I doubt I will be back at Eleven.  The place is quite nice, high ceiling, comfortable tables, relaxed but elegant. I probably prefer the room there to the new space of Legume in Oakland. Many suit people, but not exclusively.  Foodwise, this was definitely a mixed evening. - the lamb is delicious, a clear winner, 5 star. The medium rare meat is very tasty, the polenta provides a nice balance to some of the sweeter vegetables, e.g., onions. ($36) - tuna tartare was also very good, fresh and crisp. 5 star (12) - soft shell crab was pretty interesting: I enjoyed the light and slightly spicy sauce it was in. 4 star. - the pork was on the drier side - not remarkable. The slice was thin (whence the dryness), and the vegetables did not do much to highlight its tastes. 3 star - foie gras (in the tasting menu) was far from being the best I've had (but I am picky about that), the chocolate bar (basically, a \"croquant\") was on the heavier side. 3 star.   Two of us had the tasting menu. The portions are smaller, so you don't feel stuffed by the end of the dinner. On the other hand, if I end up there again, I'll just go for the lamb, perhaps with an appetizer.  I should also add that the menu is fairly conservative.",

I had a vodka martini (okay, two) with goat cheese stuffed olives - delicious - and my companion had a bourbon and coke.  The cocktails were well-poured.  We had the rock-shrimp appetizer - nice, light breading and the accompnaying dipping sauce was slightly sweet with a little kick.  We were seated a little early and our server was perfectly lovely, offering helpful tips about the menu and wine pairings.  To start, I had the oysters along with a lovely glass of prosecco, my partner had the scallops.  The beau-soleil oysters were served with a mignonette and homemade hotsauce - a little sweet, a little briny, with a dash of the hot sauce - it was perfection.  The scallops were a big hit - grits and jalapeno relish were lovely contrasting elements to the sweetness of the scallops and saltiness of the ham.  I had the seafood tasting for dinner - the golden tilefish was light and lemony, the crabcake decadent and the salmon (which I was not particularly excited about) was just a big WOW - smoky, perfectly moist, I couldn't get enough of it!  My companion had the pork chop and, given the speed with which the generous portion disappeared from his plate, loved it.  We shared the frozen dark chocolate ganache - caramel fluff, coconut sorbet - sinful, divine.  We left eleven full, slightly drunk and very happy.",

    "text": "My friend and I were in the area for the Winter Classic. We picked ELEVEN for linner (lunch/dinner) because it came up in our search for an American fare restaurant located close to our hotel. Boy did we luck out! The layout/space is distinct and the decor is modern. The dress code is in the range of smart casual to business informal. However, we were in jeans and our game gear and felt comfortable. OK, now to the important part ... the food. We shared the homemade soft pretzels with cheddar cheese-beer sauce and Maldon sea salt for an appetizer and I had the Eleven Burger -- short rib & chuck, braised veal, black pepper bacon, crispy onions and blue cheese with fries on the side. Quality ingredients, tasty flavor combinations and decent prices. We also ordered cocktails that were strong and good. The service was great in the beginning, but after our main course it was poor. We had to wait a looooong time to get  our check.",

    "text": "Disappointed with my first meal at Eleven. Wife enjoyed the Curried Chicken and Sweet Potato Soup and her Salmon entree. Her Baby Kale and Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad had no brussel sprouts and no croutons. My tasting menu had a decent Tuna Tartare. The Striped Bass was solid. Nothing special. Good flavors, but nothing I would order again or lead me back to the restaurant.  The lamb temp was off.  It was cooled for too long, and the portion was tiny - even for a tasting menu. The only bites felt cold in my mouth. It was overcooked as well; however, the flavor was excellent.  I would order that dish again as an entree.  My tasting menu dessert and my wife's warm chocolate cake were both delicious.  Every touch to both desserts were amazing.  We only complained about the salad issue. Our server was nice and apologized.  She said that the brussel sprouts will be on the salad the next time we order it, and that was it. I would have expected a manager to stop by for an apology or for the restaurant to offer to comp something.  We ordered two glasses of champagne, the salad, a dessert, corkage of $20, two coffees, etc.  Something beyond the server apology would have been appreciated. I have no desire to go back at this point, but if i were forced there for any reason, I would order the Lamb and make sure to get a dessert.",

    "text": "This is my favorite big burritto joint.  I've been here several times and never been disappointed.  The valet parking is  helpful, however should be complimentary given the cost of the place.  The interior is gorgeous with an open kitchen, great bar area, tall ceilings and private area upstairs.  The wine selection is better than most and overpriced as is the standard.  The service is as good as any other place in the city from the host to the server to  the bartender.  Dinner starts with an amouse bouche (sp?), which last night was some type of parmesan crisp with a pea mash on top (not that good really and an odd grainy texture).  Then they have a great assortment of bread they make in house.  We started last night with  a lamb taco which was perfectly cooked seasoned tender lamb on a corn tortilla with a nice sauce.  I ordered the filet, which was a prime cut filet cooked perfectly served with  a mushroom black truffle bread pudding (the bread pudding was quite heavy and except for the mushrooms pretty bland).  It's also accompanied with root vegetables in a wine reduction.  My friend ordered the seafood tasting, which we shared.  It was a small piece of salmon cooked well and seasoned nicely with  two shrimp with the head on.  The shrimp was amazing.  It was delicate and had a great flavor, tasted like they pulled them  out of the  water minutes earlier.  The crabcakes were a little below average with too much breading and a little overcooked.  A special shout out to the server Tim who was great and a pro.  Next time I'll try the chef tasting menu and if a group occassion comes up I hear the chef's table in the kitchen is quite an experience.  All in all this restaurant can stack up in any city.",

The regular restaurant side is good too and the food is fantastic, but it tends toward formal dining with service that can be a bit too attentive.  Just depends what type of evening you are looking for.  The menu changes quite a bit but some of my favorites have been the potato and goat cheese peirogies, the crab cake sandwich, and the soft pretzels.",

The ambience is delightful, upscale cozy contemporary. The wait staff are wonderful and ours was passionate about food. The food was both interesting and delicious.  Our party of four, all oyster lovers, were very pleased with theirs.  We had two different entrees, the fish sampler which featured some kind of white fish that I cannot remember, salmon and crab cakes, the cakes being the best of the three; all crab, almost no breading,  with mild seasoning. We all agreed that the pasta with mushrooms and other delictable vegetables and perfectly sauced was better . The best part of the meal for me was the lava cake dessert. Though you can get this everywhere now, I have never had a better one. It was devine.  I would definitely return to this place.",

    "text": "on the whole Eleven was awesome, why? a) i was in pittsburgh, and this is probably as fine as fine dining gets in this city. b) perfect weather outside allowed us to enjoy our dinner on the 2nd floor deck overlooking the river. c) chef's tasting menu (4 courses biatch).   Onto the food. started with an extra dirty martini on the suggestion of my pittsburghian friend. it was gross. i do not do extra dirty. but fear not, they had a great summer wheat on tap. the chef's tasting menu started with a spicy tuna tartar and a salmon carpaccio. yes. i love both of these things. oh i forgot, as a compliment from the chef they served us bluefish on a piece of toast. it was fishy. back to the chef's menu. the second course was halibut over a risotto with mushrooms. The best thing about this was that it was the same portion as my friend who ordered it as his main. by this time i was pretty full. the next dish was lamb which was served medium rare. it was excellent no doubt. (sidenote: i tried my friend's seared tuna which was equally awesome). lastly was some strawberry tart on a funnel cake. apparently they burned the funnel cake the first time so it took forever to come out. oh i almost forgot we got apps. the calamari is amazing, the avocado fries were nothing to write home about, the pierogis were pretty weak, and i wanna say there was one more but it coudln't have been great cause i dont remember it. all in all, it was $80 including tax and tip.",

I have only been here for Lunch, so take this review for what it is worth, it may not apply to the dinner menu.  I have eaten here twice for lunch, once with my wife, and another time for a non cost controlled work related lunch.  I would have to say that in neither case was I impressed with the quality of the product.  In my most recent meal, I had a scallop appetizer in which the scallops had a very palpable fishy taste.  I half wanted to skip the appetizer altogether--and I certainly did not get sick, but it really wasn't very yummy.  The service is great (really it is very good from knowledge of the dishes to the knowledge of the wines), the decor and the ambience lovely, and for all that I know the dinner quality is great, but I have been underwhelmed by lunch.  If you eat there, I hope you have a better experience given the price.",

What I will say is that I didn't know butter nut squash and brussel spouts could even be paired together but it worked beautifully. With that said make sure you try the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb if you're a lamb buff like myself. My girlfiend had the Seafood Tasting and I have nothing but positive things to say about. It comes with crab cakesk, shrimp & grits, and salmon. Everything was delicious. If you're starving then the plate size may not be up to par with your appetite so make sure you order some apps before your entree. I'm not from Pittsburgh but this place is definitely worth a try.",

Two serious problems lead to a three-star rating instead of something higher: 1) white wine served so cold it had very little flavor and 2) it was VERY noisy. The open kitchen means lots of noise; normal conversation was difficult. If you are looking for a restful evening, a quiet dinner, this is decidedly not the place to go. On the other hand, if you like a busy, party feel, it might be just the thing. They could easily fix the wine service problem, but I don't think they will be trying to make the restaurant more quiet.",

We ordered the warm chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert, and it came with a little chocolate \"happy anniversary\" plaque. The check came with coffee truffles. It's an expensive restaurant but worth the price for a once-a-year celebratory dinner. Hubby wanted me to mention that although there is music playing in the background, it is not too loud to have a conversation. Also, the porch and balcony look like nice places to eat with all the plants and greenery. Get your parents to treat you here the next time they're in town.

    "text": "So, full disclosure, we tried to get reservations to the Butcher and the Rye during our Pittsburgh trip to celebrate our one-year anniversary. When we couldn't we looked around and found Eleven and I'm so glad that we did. What clinched the deal was browsing the wine menu online--I saw that they had Pinot noir from Kunde, one of the wineries we visit on our honeymoon in Sonoma! It was a sign. And so to Eleven we went.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the interior is dominated by a large wine storage enclosure that you can see throughout the restaurant. They offer coat check which was convenient on this particular rainy evening. We were seated immediately in the area to the right of reception.   We ordered two glasses of the Kunde (of course) and the Three Greens salad to share as a starter. I'm not often impressed with salads, but this one was delicious! The red peppers are chopped small and dispersed throughout, and the goat cheese vinaigrette is heavenly. Creamy, tart and perfectly coating the vegetables. The plate is large enough to share for sure. Someone also brought around a basket of bread for us to take from. I got the sourdough, but our favorite was the focaccia my husband got.   For our entrees, I had the lamb and my husband had the strip steak. Both meats were cooked medium, just as we requested them. There was some variation in my lamb near the bone, where it tended toward medium-rare but that's difficult to mitigate and I didn't mind. My lamb was well-seasoned and savory, with the raisins, carrots and other components lending a complementary sweetness. The parsnip croutons were interesting--sort of banana bread-ish in their taste and density. I thought they were delicious but I admit I set them off to the side to eat last because they were so sweet instead of eating them with the rest of the components on the plate.  My husband's steak was well-crusted in pepper and served with a delicious sauce. The one bite that I got was delicious, spicy and tender.  Since we virtuously skipped the appetizer in favor of salad, of course we had to order dessert. The warm chocolate cake with ice cream was good but not remarkable. I'd probably try something else if I returned. It's smaller but enough to share.   Overall, a wonderful meal.",

For what you get, I think the prix fixe brunch is worth it. The Bloody Mary here is pretty good, as are the gin cocktails I've tried. My favorite part about brunch is probably the basket of mini breads. The food isn't super unique for brunch - I think we've tried most things on the menu now, but they do a good job.

No wait and it was a great day, so we sat outside. I wasn't in the mood to drink, but friends got the Ruby Red and red sangria which they both enjoyed. We shared the oysters, Blue Bay mussels (comes with kielbasa), calamari, and onion rings. The oysters were tiny and salty, not exactly how I like my oysters, but still decent. (No need for the big plate though.) Mussels were good; I especially enjoyed the soft center of the fried sourdough. The calamari was great, no complaints. I thought the onion rings were just okay; I usually prefer my onion rings to be more substantial (thicker). For the price, the portions of the mussels and calamari were large, but not so much for the onion rings and small oysters. Still, Eleven is a good option for happy hour if you're Downtown!

The waiter/waitresses stood at the bar and alternated between staring at us and making jokes.  The lack of service definitely overshadowed the food. We were very disappointed.",

Our server was excellent, and the food was great. We would definitely recommend this to anyone in the Area looking for great food.  Cons: it was kinda dark for is to see the menu.",

The food was fantastic and the portions were larger than I'd anticipated.  The bread selections were delicious.  The seafood sampler was top notch.   The decor was pretty and comfortable at the same time.  We were upstairs and practically had the place to ourselves.   Which is why I was so sad about the SLOOOOOOWWWW service.  Everything  from drinks to food to boxes to the check took a long time and it just seemed like our server showed up at all the wrong times.  They were polite and all, but absent a lot and not super on top of the flow of service. There is parking across the street and a coat check at the door, but plan to be there a while.",

Over priced for a place that is now lackluster. The wine list is swell, the atmosphere hasn't changed. However, the dining area is quickly becoming dated. Sort of reminds me of an oversized hotel dining experience. I wouldn't put it passed them to start putting lava cake on the desert menu. Sad for a place that was once my favorite for an upscale night of dining.",

    "text": "Went for dinner and ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. The meat menu was superb, the vegetarian menu was inconsistent and left something to be desired. Wines paired well.   Drinks: ELEVEN mules cocktail - Moscow mule made with homemade ginger beer. Fresh, strong ginger flavor and just sweet enough. Recommend.  First Course:  Tuna Tartare (meat tasting) -- tender and well-seasoned. Bf loved it.  Roasted Beet Salad (veggie tasting) -- The endive in the salad was overpoweringly bitter. The best part was a piece of yellow beet paired with the pistachio topping. Overall, mine was just not good. Neither of us wanted to finish it.  Second Course: Wow! Both were great.  The Swordfish (meat tasting)-- cooked so well that my bf kept commenting how much he liked it despite swordfish being his least favorite fish. Eggplant (veggie tasting) -- my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly fried cubes of eggplant sat in a bed of Israeli couscous which surprised me at being nearly as delicious. Even the julienned carrot garnish complimented the dish.   Third (Entree) Course: Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Chops (meat tasting). The smoked lamb belly was reportedly delicious and my bf couldn't get enough. But he likes lamb on the rarer side of medium rare which this was not. The waiter replaced the lamb with a beautiful half-plate presentation. The meat was still a little over cooked for his preference but it was a lot better. Everything was seasoned very well.  Casereccia pasta with kale pesto, burrata, olives, fried chickpeas and roasted peppers (veggie tasting). I had high hopes for this, but we were both underwhelmed. The chickpeas actually detracted from the dish. The kale pesto was fresh and green but not rich or flavorful.   Dessert: Black Forest Torte with mascarpone ice cream and cacao nibs (which added so much!) -- was not dry at all and paired well with the crunch of the cacao nibs and the creamy ice cream.  Lemon Cheesecake -- okay but I think it was ricotta-based and that's not my jam. I usually love cheesecake, though, so I was disappointed.   I do want to note that the service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. We were offered bread several times.   In summary, this is an amazing restaurant for carnivores 5/5. It's less reliable for vegetarians 3/5.",

I felt our waiter was a bit frazzled and slow at first but seemed to settle in as brunch progressed.  I went with beignets for my app which were fresh and perfect. To drink I went with the blood orange cocktail. While it was strong it wasn't as flavorful as I had been hoping it would be. I also must mention the fruit bowl on the kids menu. It was fresh and perfectly ripe and I stole a few berries from my boy. My entree was huevos rancheros. The flavors were bold I really enjoyed it. I also had a mimosa. It was perfectly mixed with about 2/3 champaign and 1/3 oj. I look forward to coming back and trying dinner. Hopefully service doesn't start out as slow.",

    "text": "In short: Everything about our experience was perfect! I will definitely be returning to Eleven in the near future! Read on if you want details.  Booking our reservation: We called and were cheerfully greeted with a \"what's the occasion?\" to which we replied it was a celebratory dinner. More on this later. :)  When we arrived, all of the staff were friendly and welcoming. We were instantly comfortable. We did dress up a little bit but did not feel like we would have been shunned had we been a bit more casual. The whole place somehow balances elegance and comfort. It has many different zones, both inside and out, each with their own unique feel.   Our waiter was so nice and made sure we were completely satisfied with our meal. We neither felt rushed nor ignored. As wine fans, but not quite connoisseurs,  he was able to answer any question we had about their excellent wine list. Personally, I found their selection to be fairly priced and of good quality. Again, our waiter helped us pick great wines, at the right price, that also went well with our meal.   I ordered the pork chops with some Trefethen merlot, and my girlfriend ordered the salmon with some Albarei Albrino.   The wine and bread arrived very shortly after ordering. The wines were served at the perfect temperature in beautiful glassware. They offered three types of bread, each of which was delicious. I would have loved if the bread was slightly warmer. I'm really nit picking here though. I'm finding it next to impossible to criticize Eleven.   We were only a few sips into our wine when our meals arrived. I was blown away by how quickly our food arrived. IT truly was impressively fast.... and delicious!  The salmon was both crispy and flakey at the same time. 10/10! The pork chops were succulent and flavorful. Not even the slightest hint of dryness was detected. I even ordered more bread so that I could soak up every last drop of juice left on the plate. It was incredible. 10/10!  The desert menu was solid. We split an Adelsheim dessert wine and the creme brulee. Both were fantastic. One of the best creme brulee's I have had in recent history. Now, remember when I mentioned the \"what's the occasion\" question? Well, they even went so far as to include a little chocolate \"congratulations\" sign with our desert. Unbelievable.   Our bill was topped off with a sweet, tropical fruit treat, and thank you from our waiter, and a fairly reasonable number at the bottom of the receipt. Obviously, it would always be nice to see a smaller number, but for the incredible service and food that we enjoyed, the experience of an evening at Eleven is well worth the price.  I highly recommend going to Eleven for your next special night out in the 'burgh!  Cheers!",

The soft pretzel /cheese app was fresh and hot and delicious.  My scallops app was done to perfection; not overcooked and rubbery! Yea! The black pepper gnocchi were die for and my daughter's seafood sampler was so, so good.    The service was impeccable.   The bathrooms were pretty fancy too!",

The service has always been superb and this year just felt a little flat/off.  Nothing major just not at the level we have had in the past. But to get back to the food review..... we had 1.5 dz fresh oysters and they were so delish.  The vinegrette served with them is so good!!!!  I had a kale and brussel sprout salad and hubs had the potato and bacon soup.  I think we both licked our plates clean!!!  For entrees, he had the hangar steak and I had the black bass.  We didn't even talk as we were so engrossed in devouring our meals :) We took dessert home to enjoy - I had the candy bar cake which was a mix of chocolate and peanut butter with choc malt ice cream.  He had a banana cream concoction.  Both divine!!!! Plan to go - I've never been disappointed with the food.",

Compared to other prix fixe brunches in Pittsburgh (e.g. Park Brugge) I found their menu more interested and diverse. Duck hash and Oysters for appetizers, and entrees ranging from classics (eggs benedict, steak and eggs) to less traditional (veal burger, smoked lamb heuvos rancheros). Similarly for cocktails - mimosas, bloody marys, and their own refreshing cucumbery twist on a moscow mule.  While everything was good, none of it was outstanding - I feel the execution of the dishes left more to be desired. Flavors were simple, and lacked the \"wow\" factor I get from other high end restaurants in the area.  While it was a great deal for $25, I personally prefer the Brugge restaurants for my Sunday prix fixe brunch. Same price, but I feel the quality of food there is a little better. Nonetheless, it was a solid choice for brunch!",

I chose the app portions, but two others in the group split the trio and got PERFECTLY portioned meals for each of them. The app portions with their accompaniments ended up being a little too much food. The food was good, but not fab. The initial apps we ordered for the group were actually better.

    "text": "Wowser what a bummer. My husband and I came here for happy hour a few weeks ago for our anniversary. The game plan was to sit in the bar, have a couple snacks, then get a table and enjoy dinner in the dining room. Didnt exactly work out that way though.    We arrived about a half hour before happy hour was over. The hostess notified us that it was first come first serve.  Thats fine we make our way into the bar. It is pretty busy but there is a high-top table in the middle of the bar area but no chairs. We look around for some empty chairs. To the left is a table of woman with 3 empty chairs. We ask the ladies if we could use them and they said that they are saving them. Go to the table of businessmen to the right with 2 empty chairs. Same response . So now here we are. Stuck eating standing up. My problem with this is that it is first come first serve. We are paying customers that want to SIT and spend money. The chairs being hoarded arnt making anyone any money. There shouldve been a manager or server keeping an eye on this. Eventually after our food came out, a table got up and we ran over ourselves and took two chairs. Moving on.    Our server seemed terrified and overwelmed. We never got his name. Or really anything about him. He came over about ten minutes after sitting (err... standing) at the table. Grabbed our drink order. Came back about 8 minutes later with two wines. Took our order and wasn't to be seen again until we were ready for our check. He was obviously very busy but maybe someone should have been helping him.    Onto the food. We got the brussels, calamari, shishito peppers, and oysters. All off of the happy hour menu. Due to allergies I could not try to oysters but they were good for the price according to my husband. However the remaining 3 dishes were almost inedible due to the amount of salt in all of the dishes. I am a salt lover but holy moly. We kind of picked over them, notified the server when we asked for our bill and decided not to stay for dinner.    Now I understand this is a long yelp review but I was pretty dissapointed. And yes, we shouldve brought up our concerns while we were dining. Between the hostage chairs, food quality and service it was a let-down. I understand we were happy hour customers. Not dinner customers. But should recieve the same quality food and service that would be recieved in the dining room. We may try Eleven eventually again down the road.",

Ambience is modern and although they can seat many people, it doesn't feel crowded because of the way the space is divided (outdoor patio, bar area with TVs, upstairs with two separate sections). Sunday brunch was excellent with their prix fixe menu. All around, a huge fan of this restaurant!",

For $29 you get a choice of cocktail or juice. The Cucumber Moscow Mule was so fresh and yummy! Choice of appetizer...from six fresh oysters to beignets something tasty for everyone and then an entree ranging from waffles, burgers, omelettes with bacon and so much more. All served with quality sides and attentive service. (Peet's coffee is so tasty too!) What a value! A great place to take visitors or just yourself. I have gone several times and like to keep Eleven's brunch in heavy rotation",

    "text": "Be prepared for some of the most condescending hosts you will ever meet! My husband and I had a reservation at 7/23 at 8:45 pm and we checked in at 8:40 pm. The host told us (without welcoming us and without eye contact) that our table was not yet ready but we can wait at the bar and then check in again. My husband and I made our way to the bar before we realized the host had told us to check in again and did not mention that he would come get us. Don't most restaurants have the host come find you at the bar once your table is ready?   So we made our way back to the host desk to make sure we didn't misunderstood the \"check-in again\" instruction.  The host looked down his nose , which incidentally had a bat in the right cave, and enunciated, \"As I have MENTIONED you will NEED to CHECK IN again... in FIFTEEN minutes, which is when YOU made YOUR reservation for.\" In fifteen minutes? That means 9 pm! We informed the host again that we had a 8:45 pm reservation. The host checked his computer, asked for our last name again, and said our table will be ready in a few minutes. He did not apologize for confusing our reservation and he did not apologize for the delay. In a few minutes, his colleague led us to our table without a single word of welcome. After handing our menus with a stiff and very sarcastic gentle incline at the waist, he left without a single word wishing us a pleasant evening or meal. Meanwhile, the hosts seemed to be very kind and warm to the other patrons who were white. Needless to say, my husband and I are not white.  The hosts really ruined the experience for us. We contemplated walking out but our waiter arrived and his charm and welcoming attitude convinced us to give the food a chance.  The food was delicious but not worth being mistreated for. If it was not for the nasty, condescending, and possibly racist attitude of the hosts, I would give this restaurant a 4-star review.   I hope the restaurant management considers retraining their hosts to be more welcoming and hospitable. After all, the restaurant business is a a business of hospitality and service.",

Bloody Mary, grilled sticky (cinnamon roll with bacon/butter sauce), and smoked lamb huevos ranchero with goat cheese and salsa verde. 2. Bloody Mary, pastrami hash with poached farm egg, eggs Benedict with prosciutto copa and house made English muffin. Quite possibly the best eggs Benedict I've ever had! The muffin was delicious and the egg was perfectly poached: the soft, creamy yolk stayed completely intact after being pierced. The arugula/pink grapefruit salad was the perfect foil for the richly decadent hollandaise and prosciutto. The service was excellent; knowledgeable and readily available but not over-bearing.

Lebanon was light years better and half the price ($85 vs. $200, not that I have any problem at all dropping a pretty penny on a meal). I've been to almost every restaurant on Pittsburgh Magazine's \"Top 25 Restaurants\" list for 2012. I'm sure it made the list for a reason, I just didn't see it.

    "text": "Overall a good experience, just not great one !  The welcome was good. Although the restaurant was completely empty, my favorite time to come, because it really seperates the service from the experience.   I sat at the bar between 3-5pm on a Monday. I was the only guest in the restaurant (btw). Not one single chef or manager said a word to me even though I faced, eye-to-eye, three of them (this is just sad). I greeted my bartender, whom was also my greeter when I walked through the front doors with no one in sight and meandered towards the bar.   I was welcomed traditionally with a drink menu and I explained how I had a Birthday coupon for an entree, that I'd either use it here or down the road at Kaya. The bartender was friendly and offered the food choices and explained the boundaries of the coupon.  The free entree coupon is spot on and amazing - kudos to the purveyors of BigBurrito, a solid and friendly idea for a local chain. My only complaint would be to instruct staff as to how to act for someone's birthday; although, not special to some people it is special to others and in the Sevice Industry making a big deal is seen as par for the course, especially of a guest brings the event to attention. Support the great and awesome promotion with equally high expectations of your personnel).  I ordered a gin drink and then changed it, the bartender adjusted without insult and made a fine Hendrix Martini with cucumber garnish (however, as with any garnish - less is more). It was tasty and I loved it.   I ordered the suggestion: burger, MR with cheese, and I made conversation about the business, atmosphere, etc. Although there was no one else at all in the entire building whom was a guest, the bartender seemed a tad rushed, as if there were more important things to do. I often employ a trick to see how good service can be, a trick which has failed me three times in Pittsburgh and one I think I'll save for other cities - it did not work here either.   Being new to town I did expect a good meal (thus all the talk is about only a few restaurants here worth trying). A good meal I received. The burger was cooked as I ordered and the accoutrements were perfect. The fries were tasty as well. I shared the meal with a glass of Grenache. I recommend it - light, and splendid for a burger and fries.   Unfortunately this is where the 100% tip took a back seat. My bartender disappeared only to return once, as I was barley invested in my meal, to inquire on it's flavor and my state of joy. A young man appeared, not much personality, and after taking up and enjoying the earlier bartender's company I was merely a paying toll member of a food truck line, and to beat the band it was my birthday, I displayed the evidence with ID and coupon, yet I was treated nominally in a restaurant with three guests.   It's what I always say keeps good restaurants from being great restaurants: Service.   I enjoyed my late lunch and birthday wine. I enjoyed the ambiance (I love quiet and classy, and for the brief moment I was there, this was it). I enjoyed the meal. Everyone loves a free entree. What I take points away for is the service: friendly yet vacant; helpful yet struggling; somewhat compassionate but not completely professional and what it lacks it completely fails in charm - a complete lack of charm.   I often dress down for uppity places and up for low style juke joints (throws managers off the scent). It's an even tell-tale sign of the level of service and te steps one takes to achieve success (20% or better).   One of my biggest pet peeves so far in Pittsburgh is the lack of consistency. The service part of the \"service\" industry has yet to take hold in the few places I've been.   Here's to proving me wrong on my next visit with Big Burrito. Thanks for the meal.  Thanks for the times. Overall I rate Eleven a C+, until next time.  Service after all is only outdone by flavor of the meal. And a meal is only as good as the service.",

This time they had a seafood tasting which included a crab cake, scallop and striped bass all with white grits and some veggies- very good but I probably wouldn't get again.  Oh wait- I forgot to mention the Ricotta Cavatelli appetizer we got - it's brussels sprouts, roasted butternut squash, serrano chilies, golden raisins, goat cheese, toasted bread crumbs and whoa!

It was a very good eggs benedict but I would definitely like to go back and be more adventurous and try something else off of the menu (which seems like it changes quite frequently). I got the red sangria for my brunch cocktail and it was delicious as well. I have absolutely no complaints to make about Eleven.

    "text": "This restaurant has been on our list for a little while as it is part of the Big Burrito Group. My husband and I took my mother-in-law for her birthday for brunch to try something unique. I was intrigued with the idea of paying a flat rate for the meal and having a few courses in return. A concept I have read about, but have not partaken in.  We arrived close the end of the brunch and I thought for sure we may not be given a table. To my surprise, we were ushered into the Tavern side of the building and we could choose our own seat. I loved the atmosphere -  slightly romantic, however the use of the old garage doors was superb. Sunday afternoon football was displayed on the televisions behind the magnificent bar which was nice. My only complaint was that due to so many windows on the exterior of the building, the restaurant was quite chilly.   A young man greeted us and explained the ordering process. I ended up selecting Coconut and Sunflower Seed Granola for an appetizer, and a Prosciutto Cotto, Caramalized Onions, and Cheddar Omelet with a side of orange juice (we could have opted for cocktails that was included in the price but went for the juices instead). What I loved about this place is everything is FRESH! Instantly, I knew that the orange juice was freshly squeezed. Prior to receiving our meals, we were served a basket with an array of baked goods - crossiants, blueberry muffins, cornbread, and biscuits - all fresh and made on site with a side of raspberry jam and honey butter, also made at the restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed with all of the food. My omelet came with a freshly made sausage patty that was close to being the star of my meal. Everything was delicious and I would not hesitate to return here for a special occasion.   Overall, this was a wonderful experience. My husband and mother-in-law enjoyed their food and juices almost as much as I did. We did not leave hungry. The price for the brunch was fair considering the amount of food we were served. Our waiter was very nice, slow at getting us our check and returning it to us, but nonetheless, he knew his stuff and was very pleasant. The prices meals other than the brunch seem expensive but if everything is as fresh and well presented as it was for brunch, it might be worth a try.",

We started our meal with the Barrel & Solera Aged Manhattan and Fall Collins. There is nothing bad to say about either drink, and the cranberry in the collins leant a very nice tartness to the drink.  Moving on we shared the Spicy Tuna Tartare that included sambal, avocado, pea tendrils, and papadum (Indian crispy cracker). While the tuna tartare was a bit spicy the rest of the ingredients balanced out the heat quite well. The pea tendrils really shone through even as a garnish.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the main entrees. The Gerber Farms Chicken featured a roasted chicken breast, braised leg risotto, Swiss chard (and with some other greens), and thyme jus. This entree was rich and full of flavor, but by the end I felt overwhelmed with the saltiness of the dish. The risotto and chicken were expertly cooked and so full of flavor and textures.   I had a small bite of the Sea Scallops, and again full of flavor cooked so nicely. It's really hard to find a good sea scallop that tastes good, and is perfectly cooked.",

Neither of us really enjoyed our steak, and the taste of the potato coquette reminded me of sushi somehow.   The Candy Bar dessert almost made up for how disappointing dinner was - highly recommend it. Waiter was attentive, atmosphere was nice, but highly unlikely we will go back or recommend to others.",

This is definitely one of the fancier places I have visited for brunch.  The building still retains some of its industrial roots with a nice modern, classy, and warm atmosphere.    The brunch special here includes juice or cocktail, appetizer, and main entree.  I ended up ordering pineapple juice (lame, should have been more fun and ordered a cocktail), the ricotta squash crepe, and the lamb huevos rancheros.  The meal started out by bringing out a variety of baked goods along with some blackberry jam and honey butter.  It was evident everything here is homemade, and when we questioned our waiter he informed us that the restaurant had its own bakery!  Very impressive and very well done on such a small and simple beginning to our meal.  The ricotta squash while visibly impressive I thought lacked a little flavor. There was no dominate flavor that really shined in the dish.  Lastly, the much anticipated huevos rancheros.  I had been craving this meal for a while, and although this isn't your typical huevos rancheros, it was still excellent! The combination of lamb, goat cheese, egg, and a chip base to the dish all did wonders in my mouth.  The texture was pleasing as well as the flavor.    My wife and mother enjoyed their meals as well. Next time I must try the eleven burger. I have heard from more than one person that this is the best burger in Pittsburgh.  The price here is a little higher than what I typically spend, but the food for sure is worth it if you're looking for a nice place for brunch! I will have to try a brunch cocktail next time I come as well.  This was a great experience here and I strongly recommend this place if you're looking for a nicer place to eat.",

We came here (upon months of my insistence) for a lovely Sunday brunch and boy, was it everything I had hoped for and more! We both got the prix fixe at $25 each, which really ended up being a decent deal considering it included an appetizer, entree, and brunch cocktail. I wound up with the White Sangria, a refreshingly light concoction of chardonnay/plum wines, cucumber, fruit, and rum. Absolutely amazing in the heat of summer! The mimosa was also quite good, but fairly basic.  My appetizer of choice brought me back dahn south! I ordered the beignets, tenderly topped with rose and blueberries. The presentation and idea were perfect, but I felt it could have been just a bit more flavorful. The boyfriend got the grilled sticky, sans bacon (for us plant-eaters here), which ended up being amazing. I'm sure it would have been just as good without our minor change, since sweet + salty = tastebud heaven.  And the entree - mine the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend's the Ratatouille and Goat Cheese Omelet. Both were deeeelicious. The Eggs Benedict was lightly drizzled with black truffle atop an english muffin with a side salad of sliced mandarin oranges and mint. While my dish was fairly simple, it was just so perfect and satiating! No crazy frills here - just a well-done entree. I had a taste of the omelet as well, which was equally as good. The mildness of the vegetables was offset by the rich and sour goat cheese, which acted as a perfect complement. I also couldn't stop stealing fingerling potatoes from my dining partner's plate! (Yes, there was a \"potato tax\" of 3 pieces every time he left for the bathroom or turned around.)  All in all, a great place! Service was professional and polite and the venue itself was light-filled and spacious. I can't wait to go back again!",

They brought out a perfect bread basket for starters - croissants, biscuits, muffins, a bit of every thing. The appetizers looked phenomenal. I had a bit of the egg toast and it was to die for. For my main course, I had the veal burger. Everything about it was perfect... It took all the manners I have to not devour it as soon as I tried the first bite. Perfectly done.  The ambiance was great, too. We were in a nook room on the second floor, which was great for a bit of privacy.  I also like that they were high end food, but had some options for the youngsters. They had a few menu options for kids, making it a great place for a family get together.  Definitely a win from this trip. Can't wait to go back!",

This one is an upscale spot next to the John Heinz History Center.  The restaurant has a nice contemporary decor.  There is a slightly open kitchen.  The main dining room makes a good use of green and there is comfortable seating along with white tablecloth.  The room also has high ceilings.  In some ways, the room reminds me a little of a cross between Tavern and Lucques (though Eleven lacks the inside-and-outside like atmosphere of Tavern).  Eleven's lunch menu is very inviting.  There is a great collection of starters--some nice sounding salads but also scallops and crab cakes.  Their entree section features a mix of gourmet sandwiches and burgers as well as plates with proteins like lamb and fish.  The bread at Eleven was standard stuff--not much of a crust, not much of a chew and even a little bit dry.  My starter was good.  I had the seared scallops, which were garnished with fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, spinach, sorrel, and sauce gribiche.  It was a very generous portion for a lunch starter.  I thought it was good.  Everything tasted fine and a lot of the ingredients were good.  The scallops were nicely seasoned and had a good outside crust.  They were tender, but the scallops lacked the moistness of the scallops at Lola.  I liked the pearl onions and I thought the sauce gribiche was briny, sour and good.  I also liked the spinach.  The fingerling potatoes were too big.  They were not bland and definitely not raw, but the insides of the potatoes were not as tender as they should have been (4 stars for this dish).  For my entree, I had the Elysian Fields Farm lamb t-bones with a salad of radicchio, arugula, endive, fingerling potatoes, and idiazabal cheese.  Elysian Fields Farm is a great producer of lamb (the farm is located just an hour outside of Pittsburgh).  I once had their lamb at Sona and it was exceptional there (they also provide lamb to The French Laundry).  The lamb here was good.  The lamb was like little porterhouse steaks.  There was a New York strip part that was flavorful and juicy but also with a chew and less tender texture than the filet mignon-like portion, which was very tender.  There were two t-bones and they were a tad uneven.  One was seasoned a little too heavily while the other was not as juicy as I wanted.  Still, the lamb t-bones were flavorful and good.  The salad was a very bitter salad with the radicchio, arugula and fennel.  I did not mind the bitterness, but I think some would.  I liked the cheese and they did a better job with the fingerling potatoes here, which were sliced and tender (3 stars for this entree).  For dessert, I had the chocolate-peanut pretzel candy bar, which was surprisingly  good.  The base of the candy bar was a decent though not great brownie.  There was a very good and creamy peanut butter mousse as well as a thin layer of a dark chocolate bar.  There was a decent chocolate ice cream on top as well as peanut brittle and very good pretzel nuggets that were topped with smooth melted chocolate.  There was also a caramel sauce.  The dessert tasted pretty good and while there were a lot of sweet and rich elements, the dessert did not get too rich or too sweet (4 stars for this dessert).  The meal ended with a coconut macaroon, which was mediocre and dry.  Service was good.  My server was pleasant, personable, polite, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.  Prices were about what you would expect to pay for an upscale lunch.  When considering the many high quality and premium ingredients used, this lunch at Eleven was probably a little less expensive than equivalent places in LA.  I liked my lunch at Eleven.  While the food was not exceptional, my starter, entree and dessert were all at the very least good.  The food was not really creative or exciting enough to make me want to come back, but I think this is a good option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh (they had a pretty good lunch crowd on the day I went).  There are several metered spots along Smallman Street.  There is also a paid lot for the Heinz History Center, which is $5 per day.",

    "text": "I was very excited to take my girlfriend to Eleven in the Strip District for a romantic Saturday date-night. As a part time Uber driver I had the pleasure of driving a member of Eleven's staff a few weeks ago (Jennifer). We spoke about the restaurant and the food selections and I definitely put it on my list of must try's in Pittsburgh. Due to a busy schedule I had to reschedule our reservation for a Saturday a week after our original date. This was done seamlessly through the OpenTable app which I've used plenty of times. I had the car valeted and the valet staff was very nice, upon entering I immediately got a bad vibe from the host at the kiosk. I was given a smile but the large 6'0\"+ guy at the kiosk didn't seem very genuine in his greeting. Oh well I thought, let's get seated.   Our table was nicely positioned in the back which I liked, private. Our waiter, a gentleman in his late 30's/early 40s with a brown/reddish beard greeted us. Immediately I could tell he was both apathetic and in a rush to get us out of there. He made minimal eye contact with me and his answers to my questions seemed rushed and short. We ordered a full dinner complete with drinks, appetizer, entrees and desert. At no point did our server seem interested in our experience as he looked over us at other tables with disinterest. We were both dressed nicely in business casual attire and I was hoping to make this a special experience but instead felt insulted. My girlfriend even asked me several times if I was okay or if something was wrong although I didn't disclose my disappointment until days later for her sake. We were one of the youngest couples in the establishment and in my opinion it was either age related or the fact that we weren't dressed up \"enough\" as some men had jackets on but I noticed others did not.   Awful service on an otherwise incredible food experience. This was an expensive dinner but will most likely be my last time bringing my business here.",

If I remember correctly, the walk from the museum to their location on Smallman Street, took around ten minutes. The stroll is lovely - you'll cross over one of the bridges offering impressive views of the cityscape.  An amusing duck breast salad, was followed by a vegetable cavatelli pasta main dish. Both dishes displayed very clean, honest, and fresh flavours. Service was professional - the best I experienced in Pittsburgh - as my waiter anticipated all of my needs quickly and effortlessly. Decor was uplifting, with high ceilings in the main dining room where we were seated. Wine list was one of the best I laid my eyes on in Pittsburgh, too. Many good bottles to choose from in all price points.",

    "text": "Eleven is a beautiful restaurant. It has a sophisticated design I really liked and a big plus were the spacious tables/booths so that you never feel cramped. Service was generally on-point but nothing extraordinary. They forgot to fill my dad's water glass and I wish they explained the wine pairings with the courses in more detail rather than just state what type of wine it was and where it was from.  The food was good but inconsistent. I tried the four-course tasting menu with wine pairings and was overall pleased, but also a bit disappointed. The proscuitto and egg appetizer was a great start and was really well balanced. The egg was cooked perfectly with a great runny yolk. The proscuitto added much needed saltiness to the dish while a touch of balsamic gave a nice hint of acid.  Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. The second course was a pan-seared bass that was good, but not particularly memorable. The third course was a lamb loin chop that I was really excited for (especially after reading reviews about it here on Yelp), but ultimately fell flat due to errors in cooking. I ordered the lamb medium-rare but was served a well-done piece. I had to send it back, and the next lamb I got was medium bordering on medium-well. I didn't feel like sending it back a second time, so I just dealt with it. It was seasoned well and I could see the great potential of the dish, but I couldn't really enjoy it since it was overcooked.  I am glad to say that desserts are well done here and are HUGE. The tiramisu cannolis were great and not as rich as I expected (which is a good thing). The hazelnuts were a nice touch. The chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar was delicious, but be warned... It's really sweet and heavy.  I also got to try the oysters (very fresh) and the crab cake. The crab cake was just fantastic and full of crab meat. It was one of the best I've ever had.  Eleven is a solid restaurant that I would recommend even though I wanted it to be even better. I just hope that the cooking becomes more consistent in the future.",

    "text": "Eleven was very good I must say, but nothing I had was '5 star' amazing. I'll say 4.5 stars.  Let's start with the appetizers. I had the scallops and my girlfriend had the ricotta cavatelli. Both were great, my scallops were wrapped in crispy potatoes and came in a bowl over some ham and bean stew. The stew may have been the best thing we had all night! Shame there were only a few spoonfuls. The cavatelli was also good and was served with roasted red peppers and fresh ricotta and lemon. The lemon was a bit overpowering with the red peppers for my taste, but my girlfriend enjoyed it, and when she's happy I'm happy!  I forgot to mention the bread - they brought around a sampling of breads including sea salt foccacia, semolina, and a raisin bread. All were good, the foccacia was our favorite.  For our main courses I had the pork chop while my girlfriend had the Gnocchi. Both were great. The pork chop was huge! It came with a small bit of apple sauce that was delectable when combined with a bite of pork. The Gnocchi had all sorts of good stuff in it including brussel sprout leaves crispy prosciutto and parsnips. We somehow ate everything!  It was my girlfriend's birthday so we decided to get dessert. I got the tiramisu cannoli and she got the chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar. They were ok, we were so full from dinner it was hard to eat everything. There was part of of her 'candy bar' that was a house made 'crunch' bar with milk chocolate and crispy something (rice?). I was fascinated with that I tried to get the waiter to tell me how to make it!   Overall I give Eleven four and a half stars, it seemed a bit pricey for what we got, but I'm not complaining. All the food was delicious and the wait staff were very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. I now compare every restaurant to 'Salt of the Earth' because the meal I had there is the best I've had in Pittsburgh, so if Salt is 5 stars, this must fall underneath that. I wish there was an option for 4.5 stars but alas there isn't, or maybe I'm just incompetent at yelping. Give Eleven a try! I think next time I go there will be for lunch so I can get my hands on that delicious looking 'Eleven Burger'",

Too much effort was spent trying to complicate the menu vs delivering solid food. For instance, no one at the table could dare eat the short ribs due to the horrid taste and excess fat. Another seafood dish was served cold but definitely needed heat. For a party of four with a bill well over $$$$$$, it was definitely not worth it! Alas, I will try to revisit my review in the next couple weeks as I travel back to the Burgh and try the normal menu based on a friend's recommendation.",

Though hell apparently froze over (it was first week of Feb), I did not want to be imprisoned in my hotel room so I yelped for the nearest well-reviewed place to take my taste buds.  At first I thought it'd be close enough to just walk to.  Silly California girl that I am.  As soon as I stepped out onto the hotel driveway, I slipped on ice.  In front of bumper to bumper traffic.  Sad FACE!  I immediately scrapped that idea and hopped into the nearest cab for a 5 minute ride.    After making it safely (relatively) to the restaurant, I was immediately seated (I was having an early dinner).  The host was a little snooty but it is that kind of place and I was very underdressed.  My waiter, on the other hand, was super nice and... super happy. Maybe it's the Californian negativity but I was kind of caught off-guard by his excitement. Still, I appreciated his attitude, especially after the weird looks I kept getting from the host.  I knew what I wanted to order as soon as I sat down (that's because I had examined the menu online an hour before) - seared foie gras (duh!) and the Eleven burger.  The foie gras was excellent and generous but the burger was huge (no complaints there) and really salty.  I'm not sure whether it was the veal or the bacon that was salty but it was over-seasoned.    Overall, great ambiance, good (not great) food, and good service.  Pretty impressed.",

I came back in October 2011 with very high expectations.  Alas, I was somewhat disappointed.  The space itself is nice - quirky and intimate.  The service is polished and knowledgeable.  The cooking is hit or miss.  I started with the cider glazed plums with gorgonzola and speck.  A nice idea in theory, but I found this dish to be very harshly flavored.  The glaze was extremely acidic - almost astringently so.  The speck was good, but the gorgonzola should have been a sweeter version thereof.  I found it too harsh with the plums, a combination that I would have otherwise thought perfect.    My entree was the Jameson lamb done three or four ways - lamb saddle roasted and sliced, lamb bacon and some other slow roasted cut that fell apart like carnitas.  The lamb was nicely cooked and presented, the beets and potatoes perfectly cooked.  The red onion marmalade was, to reuse a word, astringent.  It caused heartburn soon after I left the restaurant, and I only had a couple of bites.  Does the chef taste his sauces?  Maybe not, based on my recent dinner there.  Had an unmemorable deconstructed banana cream dessert.  Meh.  For the money, I am sure one can do better in Pittsburgh.  I know I will try someplace else next time I am in town. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try Eleven this morning for brunch. We weren't greeted with a very warm welcome to start, and we were almost seated on the restaurant side but our table seemed a little close to the kitchen (open kitchen concept), so we opted to sit in the bar. The dated couches and decor in the bar seemed like it was due for a remodel, but we wanted to give the place a shot anyway. Our service was overall pretty lack luster, we had a few questions about the menu that either couldn't be answered or were answered quickly with a somewhat short response.. We opted to get the price fixe that included a cocktail, appetizer and dessert. The pastries they brought out were great, although the biscuits were a touch dry/overcooked. Both my husband and I thought our food was mediocre for what we paying, and my steak with the crispy farm egg (egg was delicious and great!) was very overcooked.. Our bartender (didn't mention name) was busy chatting at the other end of the bar, so we sadly didn't order another bloody mary (which was also very good).  Overall we just didn't feel as comfortable as we would've hoped for dining in a nicer establishment like Eleven.. The food was okay, and the place has potential, it just fell short in a few key areas.",

    "text": "Eleven is one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh.  This restaurant exudes casual elegance without giving you that desperate \"You are eating in a fine dining establishment!\" feeling.  I dont really know what that means either, but you'll understand if you have been there.  It's beautiful inside, but its also comfortable and welcoming.  You will need a reservation to dine at Eleven, and once you are there you will want to wait in the bar area and have a cocktail if you are able to.  The mixed drinks are all excellent.  Don't dine here if you are in a hurry!  Eating at Eleven is an experience and your dinner will probably take about an hour and a half.  One of my favorite things about Eleven is their bread basket, I believe they make the bread in house.  I highly recommend the beet salad and the Seafood Tasting.  It's incredible.  The food there is consistently fantastic.  I sound like a desperate girl describing all the things she likes about her crush.  I have a crush on Eleven.  I'm not ashamed.  There is only one menu item I wouldn't avoid again, and that was the steak.  It was over $40 and it was good, but my mind was not blown.  You can get a steak anywhere, order something else.  Eleven is not one of those restaurants that will leave both you and your wallet starving.  I never have room to order the desserts but they look fantastic.  This is a perfect restaurant to take a date, a business client, your parents from out of town, or to just have dinner w/ your friends.  This restaurant is good if you have a large party--call ahead and see if you can't reserve one of the dinings rooms.  My friend had her birthday party there and we had excellent service in the dining room.  If you consider yourself a foodie, and you're from PIttsburgh and have not been to Eleven yet you need to realize that this is an Epic Fail, and make reservations for Eleven NOW.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants. It feels like an experience, not just a meal here. They make their own break and have a person delivering it around, you have several choices usually. Some highlights are as follows: -the oysters are great. They serve two sauces, one which is a bit spicy, and it really adds to the oyster flavor.  -they had sea scallops wrapped in a crispy, stringed potato. It was resting in black beans and had prosciutto on top. It may have been the best thing I've ever tasted.  -ordered the kale salad. I normally don't care for kale, but it worked well with the oil dressing and light Parmesan shredded on top of it. -had the New York strip rare. The steak was seasoned and seared extremely well. It was served with Parmesan potato tots that made me drop and F bomb they were so good. The outside was crispy, the inside was smooth like they somehow figured how to mash a potato and coat it in a crispy potato outside.  -they change their menu through the seasons, so if you check out their menu online, don't be surprised if you show up and the menu is a bit different. Nothing major, but I've gone with people expecting to see certain dishes after seeing them on their website, but then being disappointed to see that it wasn't being served. Regardless, I was never unhappy with a meal.",

Everything about the restaurant was impeccable, from the food to the service to the ambiance.  We ordered two appetizers - the raw tuna and the scallops. I loved the scallops - and I order scallops at any place that has them on the menu, so I like to think that I know what's good :) The accompaniments to both appetizers were balanced and well done. For our entrees, I don't even remember what we ordered - my boyfriend got some chicken dish, and I got the fish. Both were very good - the usual balanced, delicate flavors and varied textures.   Dessert was divine and deserves its own shout-out. The banana cream pie was unique and light, while the creme fraiche creme brulee was more \"normal\" but still an elevated kind of average.",

    "text": "Yum. What a delicious brunch! I went here with a monthly brunch club and I think we were all satisfied with our decision to come to Eleven! I had the gnocchi with Brussels sprouts and pancetta. It was delicious. The Brussels sprouts were sliced and the pancetta was cubed and there was a nice amount of gnocchi covered in a nice well seasoned sauce that has a little bit of kick. I was also able to try the beignets which were fried dough puffs coated in powdered sugar. They were good and reminded me of funnel cake. Other guests had the yogurt and granola which looked super yummy. A few healthy dollops of thick creamy yogurt topped with coconut almost granola with mint, apple, and pomegranate.   The table was also served a basket of croissants and muffins with butter and apple jam on the side. The croissants were super flakey and I had a hard time not making a total mess! The mess was worth it though for that flaky goodness.   Appetizers for brunch are $9, entrees are $15, and brunch mixed drinks are $9. You can get their Prix Fixe and enjoy one of each for $25.",

However, my lamb entree was overcooked, and my wife's roasted chicken and her gnocchi appetizer were inedibly over-salted. The white asparagus soup was bland and uninventive. In addition, we had a hard time enjoying ourselves over the sound of whom I presume was the chef cursing and yelling at the kitchen staff. Finally, the decor is hopelessly outdated now. Perhaps in 2005 it was state of the art, but it'd be nice if someone realized a decade and a half has passed since then. 2/5 overall, and we will not be trying again. Hard to understand how this establishment was voted one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For better, more creative food at a better price point with stylish and contemporary decor, I'd recommend avoiding downtown and the Strip and instead looking at some of the up-and-coming places in the East End and South Side.",

    "text": "Have you really looked forward to something and then got disappointed? That was mine and my fiance's experience here at Eleven. We went for lunch, so dinner could be a different experience.   Food: 3.5/5. The food was pretty good. It was quality, but it just wasn't \"top restaurant in the city\" kind of quality. I got the swordfish sandwich, and my fiance got the scallops. The swordfish sandwich came with a salad that was on point. Did not meet our expectations, though. Barely worth the price.  Atmosphere: 1/5. Yikes. This was bad. First of all, there was no music playing. My fiance and I were basically whispering because we could hear everyone's conversations in the entire room. That was weird. The most frustrating part about my entire visit was when I went to the men's restroom. There were PICTURES OF COMPLETELY NAKED WOMEN IN EROTIC POSES ALL OVER THE PLACE. Why! Just why. I get it, it's art or whatever, but the line of art and \"too much\" was crossed. Regardless, the fact that the men's restroom was covered in naked women feeds into the stereotype that all men love to see naked women. This really saddened me. Worst part of the trip. Bathroom art is the platform for a restaurant to speak its values; sometimes you will find pictures of the city skyline or nature or seasonal pictures. This destroyed my view of Eleven, and the reason why I am never going back. The architecture was cool though (I'm trying to stay positive).  Service: 5/5. The server we had was great. Susan was awesome and super nice. She was down to earth, and wanted to have a conversation, but also respected our personal time/space. One of the best servers I have ever had at a restaurant. (Give her a raise, Eleven).  For those who are wondering the dress code: basically look like a hipster or a business person and you'll be fine. I wore a nice sweater (we went in February) and skinny jeans, and I didn't get any funny looks. My fiance wore a sweater and skinny jeans too (we are destined for each other, wearing the same clothing everywhere), and she was fine. These sweaters were not cosby sweaters though, they were more on the hipster side of the hipster/business casual.  Great service. Mediocre experience. Go elsewhere.",

I've always been a huge fan of Eleven and I'll certainly give it another try. But last night's entree was simply not good.  That's not to say the evening didn't have its highlights.  I'm in LOVE with Eleven's Mule.  Of course, show me any Moscow Mule and I'm bound to love it, but their's was especially tasty. I also very much enjoyed the beet and carrot salad, and our starter of Pumpkin Cavetelle was a solid \"good.\"  However, my Seafood Tasting entree was fishy and bland. Comprised of salmon, scallop and crabcake, I [of course] expected to taste some fish. But you know when you get a serving a fish that's too fishy to enjoy? That was the case with the salmon and a bit with the scallop.  Neither had much flavor, so for the flavor to be all fishy, it just wasn't good. The crab cake wasn't far behind in the lack-of-flavor department.  Our server was extremely excited to be working there, so I'll give some kudos to him, but overall it was not a good entree experience.  I did try my guest's Pork Shank and it was amazing, so it must've just been an off night for the fish department.  Sad fish face... 8(",

First & foremost the wait staff was attentive but not in your face, which I LOVE !!  I was skeptical of this place since it is a \"chain\" (Big Burrito) which, by most standards does not bode well to a high end venue.    I am corrected here. Big Burrito chain does not immediately scream high end value, atmosphere and culinary wonderment however, this place breaks the mold. It is upscale in atmosphere, their wait staff are knowledgeable and dressed appropriately.  The bar is FULL and affordable and the place is inviting. Ordered the Eleven burger and seared tuna with greens salad; all were wonderful. The tuna was seared with a salad of cous cous & greens & was delicious. The burger was to die for served with fresh cut fries & cooked just as I ordered !!!  I could have eaten two.   I loved the food and the service here.  I am looking to make plans to experience the chefs tasting menu.  I read/hear its wonderful. As far as today's lunch, it was delicious and service was spot on. I will be back and recommend this establishment; even though it is a Big Burrito chain restaurant.  Kaya (Big burrito too) is horrible but this one (i hope) is trying to break the chain reputation.   So far so good because everything we had today was delicious !! We will be back.  Can't wait.",

We made reservations ahead of time and I don't know if it's because our party of 7 was big so there was no where else to accommodate us or they knew it was for a birthday, but we were seated in like a separate room which was nice! We can be loud, especially all 7 of us together, so it was nice we were partially separated. Throughout the meal, the wait staff was really friendly and patient with us. Deciding took a while and since my grandparents can't speak English, we had to do a lot of translating with them but they all just stood by patiently and were helpful with our questions.   The food was good! The steak tartare was good and so were the scallops. My grandparents both got the tasting menu and they got the white truffle tagliatelle as one of their courses. I got to try some and that was delicious. I loved it! For my entree, I got the ribeye. It was cooked well. The sides were good except the foie gras butter was a bit too strong for me.   For dessert, we splurged. The brown sugar ice cream cookie, banana creme pie, creme fraiche brulee, and the candy bar. They were glorious. I died at the banana creme pie. I pretty much ate the entire thing. The rest were all really good. I think the candy bar ended up being a bit too sweet for me, but not bad. It was like eating a really thick fudgy piece of chocolate. It was good but too big.  We had a lot of fun and had a great meal. Really good for special occasions.",

They seemed deeply unhappy. No smiles. Not friendly. When a large party is dining you expect a bit of a loss of privacy. But the constant barrage of water pouring was intrusive and obnoxious. We could never relax. Between us, we have dined at some amazing fine dining establishments in major cities around the world. Eleven needs to get over itself. There were diners in shorts and t-shirts. Lastly, did you charge us an automatic gratuity and then we tipped on top of it? It would have been nice if that was mentioned. If not, you need to perhaps revisit your pricing. All in all, delicious food served by an unfriendly staff in an uncomfortable environment.",

I left 100% happy and gluttonously full.  A few negatives: Parking is either $5 for valet or $5 for the lot across the street. The price for two cocktails at the bar was a steep $24. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table I reserved a week prior that was on the second floor and had no visible reason to keep us waiting.  Back to the glowing food review...  I'm not sure I've ever had a brunch this tasty before. From the berry jam and whipped honey butter to hot, flaky pastries to grilled sticky to beignets with raspberry and Meyer lemon sauces to smoked pork huevos rancheros (lentils, goat cheese, tomatillo salsa = better than any preparation I had while living in Arizona for six years) - every bite I took was unique, delicious, and memorable. If I hadn't been stuffed to the gills, then I would have ordered everything again and eaten another round of brunch.   Other than Casbah, I'm not a huge fan of big Burrito Restaurant Group's restaurants. I think they are mostly over priced and underwhelming; however, Eleven delivers on pretty much every level: ambiance, quality and execution, service, and overall experience. I intend to save up some \"fun\" money to go back for dinner :)",

Outside of a minor service issue, which the manager quickly resolved, everything was spot on again.  While it's been around for some time, Eleven continues to be one of the staple Pittsburgh fine dining establishments (even better, it's not snobby fine dining either).",

Definitely the best food in Pittsburgh, and it was perhaps the best meal I've had in my 30 years of life. We had the brunch menu, and there were good vegetarian options. The salad was outrageously flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The beignets were divine. I wish we could eat here every day! Everyone should eat at this restaurant!",

    "text": "Went there for a group dinner. The entrance was unassuming but the place was much larger than I expected.  wine cellar looked really nice and the positioning above the dining area was really creative.  The wine list was generally limited with a selection that was overpriced - except for a couple of gems...    Food was a set menu and consisted of several dishes.  I had a series of sushi style bites to start. The tuna tartare on toast was very fresh and had a nice ponzu dressing. The fried unagi in a blanket (I think it was as it was accompanied by the traditional bbq sauce) was a little too salty and the other sushi was very tasty.    The salad was very fresh and the greens excellent. dressing was light and was a great interlude before the salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was really sushi quality.  Accompaniments were light and the whole taste and texture was well put together.  The only thing I would improve on is the balsamic - I expected some more than a drizzle on the side.  It would have been a perfect dish with a little more.    The negative item for me is that the service was generally slow. it took a while to get the wine, open it and serve it.  It also took a while for one person on our table to get their food - for every course.  The restaurant was not that busy so I am not sure what the issue was.    Will go back",

Everything about Eleven is carefully curated from the greeting you get when you walk in, to the service in the bar, to the friendly yet not intrusive service. The menu is varied, something for everyone, though occasionally I find myself wishing there were specials or that the seasonal preparations changed a bit more often. The food is impeccable, and when something goes awry they are always quick to fix it. I prefer to sit upstairs, the downstairs seating is a little \"cold\" to me, for lack of a better word. And the bar menu is also great. This is a place where you can wow your guests.",

Between my fiance and I, we were able to sample their brunch menu very thoroughly.  Chicken and waffle:  the bite sized fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  I loved the spicy pickle.  Blueberry Beignet:  super sweet, not as fluffy as NOLA and wish it came out at the end as a dessert!  Pretty big sizing for one.  Get it to share.  Smoked lamb huevos rancheros:  MUST-GET.  The lamb to spice to egg pairing is phenomenal.  Linguine with lump crab:  A bit vanilla for brunch item.  The zucchini and vegetable was over cooked and created a lot of water, which watered down the uni citrus butter sauce.",

    "text": "My colleague and I dropped by for a quick dinner and got in without reservation. Although we were told they were moving things around to accommodate us....hmmm- does being a pricey restaurant mean acting pricey too? :/ Anyhow, we were offered bread from the bread basket- there were 3 different breads- I tried the semolina and flax and raisin, they were both tasty ( I love bread). However, they were not warm, and as I slathered butter on my bread, there was a long strand of hair (no clue where it came from- butter or on the bread). The server was happy to give me new bread and change our butter and apologized. But hair= always worth a mention. Another disappointment- we weren't offered more bread as our bread cleared and we waited on our mains. Again- expectations from a high end restaurant= excellent service. I ordered the Ricotta Cavatelli- the pasta was cooked perfectly, and the chicken of the woods mushrooms were delicious. However, I would have loved the rest of the vegetables (beans, tomatoes) to have absorbed more of the sauce flavor. Overall, there could have been more basil, and more flavor. For a $24 pasta, it was on the bland side. The portion was generous, and lasted for another small lunch or breakfast (if you're into pasta for brekky!). We were also told the menu changes almost daily/weekly- however, in the last week that I've looked at the menu- it's been the same, so that was surprising. Maybe our server meant seasonally? :/ Another disappointment was the lack of vegetarian options. Potato gnochhi (as a small plate, not a main) and the ricotta cavatelli were the only solid vegetarian options, in addition to basic salads- which my coworker ordered, and thought was an average, decent salad, nothing to write home about.  I had been super excited to try Eleven- but alas I left unimpressed.",

We asked for a different table when we entered and the person at the door receiving us mentioned that \"the floor above also has only a table and 2 chairs\", she seemed displeased that we asked for a table away from the kitchen and infact gave us an impression that she was doing a favor by giving us a different table.  During the meal we asked for a vegetarian salad and they served lamb which we had a bite off before realizing that it isn't what we ordered, the manager came and asked us if we were allright and we decided not to make a big deal and said ok - he just said ok and with no apology walked away. We truly experienced how lack of customer focus flows from the management to the folks on the floor!

Our server arrived with drink list.  Wine was the drink of choice.  I am not a wine person, but there did seem to be a wide selection.  The wine came without delay.  The oysters were fresh and not too heavy on the brine.  The lobster bisque was good, but pretty short on the lobster meat!    The sea scallops appetizer was great.  Be warned that it only comes with two scallops but they were fresh and had a great flavor.  We also had the beet salad.  This was pretty standard.   Good enough though.  The scottish salmon was done medium rare as I like it.  The portions size was bigger than expected - a pleasant surprise.  The brussel and parsnip were great addition.  Desert was the creme brulee.

Great deal for just going to lunch at Mad Mex a few dozen times a year... Got there at 2:00 which is in between their lunch & dinner shifts so I sat at the bar.  Brian greeted me right away bringing over a glass of water and a basket of bread and menus.  I decided on the Lobster Roll that came w sides (I chose the seas at salad) and I ordered a Sly Fox Pike Pilsner.  The beer was fresh & light and had a great taste.  I was only into half a piece of bread when my lunch arrived.   The Caesar salad was DELICIOUS.  It has a fantastic taste and the calamata olives gave it a nice tang.  The kosher pickle spear was a perfect addition.  The lobster roll itself was very good.  The grilled roll was very fresh and the lobster salad inside was good.  This was my first ever lobster roll but not my first lobster.  The filling was mostly claw meat but it wasn't all completely cooked.  There was a distinct springiness to the meat that I don't think is there if cooked completely.  I could be wrong...   Overall, my visit was exceptional. Service was excellent, the place was spotless...  I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner.  Maybe even the next time I'm looking for a special place to bring the wife for dinner...

I started off with the Newton's apple cocktail which reminded me a mojito with an apple kick. Super delicious, I may have to learn how to make this on my own. For the appetizer, I picked the grilled sticky which is a grilled cinnamon bun in the shape of french toast, with an amazing bacon butterscotch reduction drizzled on top. This hefty appetizer was absolutely out of this world and it was hard to stop myself from devouring the whole thing, especially since my goat cheese and mushroom omelette was coming up next. The omelette came with a side of crispy fingerling potatoes mixed with fried shallots and a bit of spicy seasoning and bacon. These were probably some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had, and the black pepper bacon was really something else. The omelette was packed with goat cheese (always a plus in my books) and cooked to perfection.   Overall an incredibly delicious place for brunch with a lot of variety and options. Brunch is absolutely well worth the price for everything you get. Service was excellent and I definitely plan to make this place one of my regular upscale go-to brunch locations.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to go to celebrate my birthday. We chose Eleven because we both had Big Burrito restaurant group coupons, and Eleven's menu sounded enticing. Lately I'm in the habit of going in to try restaurants during the dead period around 2-3 PM for late lunch... The benefit is that places are usually slow and there's no issue finding a table. The downside is, many places are short-staffed during this time, and this is the exact issue we had on our visit. There was just one waiter for the 'tavern' side. Although he was very gracious and polite, he had to juggle 3 tables, the bar, and a gin vendor all at once. It took a while to order dessert because he was talking gin!  But now, to the meal: Cocktails were a must. I ordered a \"Newton's Apple\". It was alright. The apple pieces within were a bit brown and soft... not disgustingly so, just enough to be disappointing. My friend's \"Starry Night\" was much better; I'd absolutely recommend that drink. I ordered the Lobster Roll with a side salad. The salad took up a full half of the plate and was beautiful and colorful, loaded with arugula... My favorite! The lobster roll was stuffed full of a generous portion of lobster. Although it wasn't anything revolutionary, there are some things that are just so exquisite in their usual form. Lobster rolls are one of those things. My friend got the Eleven Burger (a veal sandwich). It too was jam-packed with so much meat. He got a Cesar side salad; again, quite a generous portion. We ordered a dessert to split: the Creme Fraiche Brulee. (I triple-checked their menu to make sure I got all those little accents right, FYI). It came with a Raspberry Almond Macaron, which was preety good, and fresh raspberries, which were Wonderful. Nothing about a restaurant impresses me more than very fresh, perfectly ripe raspberries... Nothing is better. The Creme Brulee itself was fluffy goodness under a crisp, warm blanket of wonderful caramelized sugar. After dessert, the waiter surprised us with a special treat: Truffles filled with a Banana Cinnamon mixture and a chocolate sign that read \"Happy Birthday\"! I loved the combination, and the waiter even ran back and grabbed me two more! My pal wasn't as fond of the truffles, but Banana Cinnamon is a bold combination that isn't really for everyone.  In conclusion, even though at times it was a little wait before we could get something ordered, the experience here was very pleasant and it felt like the staff here put a lot of effort into making things special.",

First of all the space was huge and gorgeous- they can accommodate large parties and also have a beautiful terrace we were able to enjoy our meal on. My husband and I shared a gnocchi appetizer and tuna tartare, both were very tasty but the entrees were what really shined. I had the swordfish which was cooked perfectly and paired with a rich shrimp risotto. He had the strip steak that had a french onion sauce, cheese curd mashed potatoes, and onion rings. Both were large portions and bursting with flavor (I even took a third of my dish home). When we got the dessert menu we couldn't turn down the candy bar dessert- a must for any chocolate peanut butter fan. When we left my husband stated he has a new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

The edemame was different than any I've ever had (old bay, lemon juice, BACON!) and the flavors surprisingly complimented each other very well. The tuna tartare also had an amazing flavor combination. Overall the plates were filling. They were all served within 5-10 minutes of me ordering. The service is outstanding. The best part? It was a truly enjoyable experience. I will definitely be returning with employees and customers alike. Thank you!",

Our waitress was in training, however she was phenomenal and told jokes and became a fun part of the evening. We ordered tuna tartare, plum soup, and crab cakes which were all delicious appetizers. I split the halibut and swordfish which were very tasty. Everyone had clear plates at the end of the meal. I brought a Prantl's cake, which they brought out to show the table and then had sliced in the kitchen. Overall, it was such a delightful and fun evening, which all the staff at Eleven made possible. My parents are quite picky diners and they absolutely loved the restaurant.",

Everything was prepared perfectly and all the flavors on the plate complimented each other perfectly. The soup I had as an appetizer was one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted. The desserts we had were also incredible (We had the molten chocolate cake, hazelnut candy bar, and creme brulee). I had the leven-ade to drink, and it was wonderful.  Also, when the wait staff found out my family and I were there to celebrate graduation, they put a chocolate plaque that said \"Congratulations\" on it!

I had classic martinis and you get to choose the gin you would like...including top of the line Hendrick's, all for the same $6 price. My friend drank Americanos: gin, Campari and blood orange juice, which were top notch. We ordered all the items on the food menu except for the tuna and mussels. (Wish we had them, though.) Actually we had four orders of the oysters and eagerly devoured a dozen of those perfectly delicious bivalves each. The shishito peppers were new to us and a wonderful discovery. Easy to eat, not hot. Just great...will have to find them locally now. Also high marks for the calamari and onion rings. Although the soft pretzels were our least favorite, they were delicious. Warm, cheesy, bread-like. To us, nothing could beat the oysters and peppers, but I am sure there are people who would rank the pretzels their favorite. The bartender was friendly and helpful.  Too bad this is four hours away or we would be there every week!",

    "text": "Eleven does a nice job being inventive but not over the top when it comes to pairing flavors. They cure their own meat, dishes are gluten free and they have a wine storage area upstairs.  Chef Derek Reynolds put a nice menu together here.   We tried the kale salad and beet salad. I must admit the beet salad w cured meat and manchego cheese was the best I ever tried. We then ordered all appetizers - 5 of them.   Scale of 1-5 w 5 being spectacular:  Steak tartare:  3  Tuna tartare:  3 Scallops:  5 (scallops are usually meh, boring... not these. Huge sushi grade diver scallops prepared the most unique way ever seen. This is a home run dish!) \"Spaghetti\":  4 (w lobster and uni) Crab cakes:  4 (all lump, very tasty, potatoes on the side seemed out of place)  Wine:  personally, I would stick \"by the glass\".  Wine list is pretty heavily dominated by Cali wines that are over priced.  We did find a really nice Amarone 2009 that retails for $70 at big box retailers w a small margin on top. Other than that the Mumm Rose Champagne is a good value and nice for a starter or end game after dinner at $12/glass or $60/bottle.    The entrees appear dull at first but take the time to read how the dishes come together and you'll be intrigued. I think the tasting menu is kind of half assed - a vegetarian option for $45 and a meat one for $65 w optional wine pairing at $25. They should ramp this up, give options, allow for add on's (foie gras etc) and ditch the wine pairings until the list catches up to food quality.   The service is friendly and prompt but I don't get the impression that everyone is immersed in the passion/knowledge of food.   We will come back again.",

    "text": "The first thing I noticed when my guests and I walked in was the design of this place. It is really nice. After trying several \"just okay\" restaurants in Pitttsburgh, I was ready for a great meal. My party and I had read many reviews of Pitt restaurants, and this sounded like our best shot at a great \"fine dining\" experience in this city.  We were extremely disappointed. Sorry, but I'm convinced there is no fine dining in Pittsburgh.   We all had the Price Fixe Tasting menu ( quite pricey for what it was, btw ), and none of us liked it. The lamb was too spicy, and the wine pours were really small.Three and a half hours for four courses?  Wow, the pacing of the entire meal was just dismal. I don't think it was the server's fault, though- she seemed to be trying most of the time. Maybe it was the kitchen's fault? I'm not sure, but this was just ridiculous. I shouldn't have my wine pairing glass 45 minutes before it's accompanying dish. Yet we did. A couple of times.   Also, I am gluten free, but usually this doesn't matter at nice restaurants. Eating  out and staying GFree is becoming easier I am finding. So many restaurants have GF offerings and substitutions available.  Eleven, however, was not gluten free friendly at all. Nor did the server even seem aware of what GFree is. After awhile, the Bread cart coming around EVERY FIVE MINUTES got to be humorous. Even to the rest of my party, who CAN eat bread. Seriously, if the rest of the place was as on the ball as the bread guy, maybe our experience would've been slightly better here.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to eat here for years. When I received my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon this year- I knew right away that we were going to come here. We made a reservation on a Friday night for about 6:00 pm. There really weren't that many people here, so a reservation wasn't completely necessary. The service was excellent from the start to the finish. I started off with a Moscow mule, which was delicious. I then had the cold strawberry soup, which was unique and really good. I loved the basil granola that was on top. It was really different and I'm glad I tried it. While we were waiting for our meals, a gentleman came by with three bread options. I had the sea salt and the raisin and both were really good. For dinner, I had the chicken dish which was served with risotto and swiss chard. It was WONDERFUL. I ate the entire thing. It was so incredibly flavorful. The risotto was perfect and so tender and the chicken was so juicy with crispy skin. So good. Brendan had the hanger steak, which he really enjoyed. His came with roasted cauliflower which he normally doesn't like, but he loved it. It also came with a potato and horseradish cake, which complimented the steak so well. For dessert, I went with the three different types of gelato- cherry, guava, and mandarin orange. To my surprise, the three little scoops were presented with an assortment of fresh berries and small baked goods. It even had a piece of white chocolate with \"Happy Birthday\" on it for me. The guava gelato was my favorite- Brendan enjoyed a fresh chocolate chip cookie. As if we didn't eat enough, the waiter gave us little lemon truffles when he gave us the check. So good. We were so impressed and I am really looking forward to returning. I am dying to check out their Happy Hour sometime- their bar has a different menu, and I am curious to try their burgers and more casual menu items.",

The bar is beautiful and the dining spaces are intimate and comfortable, even in an open area.   The food and service we've experienced here have always been exceptional! We've done special occasion dinners here before and today discovered what an amazing lunch spot Eleven can be. Definitely more on the fine dining scale than our typical lunchtime fare and what a nice treat it turned out to be!   My husband ordered hangar steak with fries and I ordered the sea scallops with roasted cauliflower over delightfully peppery polenta, radicchio and crunchy focaccia croutons. Both our dishes were spot on! Interesting, flavorful and well balanced. Honestly, perfect!   Service by Glenn was attentive and personable. We both looked at each other during our meal and said, why don't we come here more often? Well it's on our radar now!",

We came in at the last seating and called ahead, and the person on the phone (I think his name was Elliot) was so polite and well spoken. He was the deciding factor that made us rush in to grab a table.  We sat outside on their beautiful and romantic upstairs deck. Service was impeccable, from start to finish it was friendly, attentive, and elegant. Our waiter answered all of our questions about the menu.  I ordered the Scottish Salmon, served in a cream sauce with (I think) wood ear mushrooms. These were the earthiest mushrooms I've ever had, a very deep and intriguing flavor. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The boy ordered a seafood sampler type of entree, my favorite item being the scallops. For dessert we split the banana cream pie, which is structured more like a napoleon with drizzlings of caramel and meringue chips. I'm not a sweets person but this was very good. And they have a killer bread basket too.",

We started with the scallops, which were so good, but you only get 2 just an FYI. For entree's I had the beef tenderloin and my boyfriend had the swordfish. Both were extremely flavorful and great portion sizes! They had a very large dessert menu as well, so we chose 2. The creme brulee was perfect and came with a macaroon! My boyfriend had the candy bar which was very good too. We both loved the atmosphere and interior decor and the service was excellent. We'll definitely be back!",

In terms of ambiance, Eleven has one of the most elegant restaurants I've dined at.   I stopped in for brunch with my girlfriend and we shared the Steak & Eggs along with the Cresta di Gallo. The steak was cooked perfectly. The dish was very filling. The Cresta was an elbow like pasta which was served with a delicious sauce and topped with mushrooms, pesto, goat cheese, and pine nuts. It was prepared a little too salty for my liking. Similarly to the steak and eggs, it was very filling.  Prior to receiving our main courses, we had a complimentary bread basket and a grilled stickey. The bread basket was outstanding. I've never had w better complimentary item. It came with biscuits, a blueberry muffin, a brown sugar muffin, and a croissant. All four were great!",

I had the foie gras and then the chicken. They hit the right notes with both dishes, which were served promptly at the proper temperature for enjoyment - not allowed to cool down and lose their flavor by sitting on a rack somewhere. Great wine list, and a nice bar to sit at before your meal to have a drink with friends. They know exactly how to mix casual comfort with refined flavors! Will definitely be back soon!",

We didn't order much but their food was incredibly filling!    Their focaccia bread alone kicked up my appetite.  We shared their butternut squash soup ($10).  It was light yet creamy on the tongue.   For entrees, we had the Seared Rare Tuna Salad ($18) and the Strozzapreti ($18).  MOST delicious tuna ever - it was pink in the middle of each thick slice and crispy on outside.  The strozzapreti was the BEST pasta dish I ever had.  The tomato-bean-oregano sauce was delicious.  All the ingredients in the dish were fresh and of HIGH quality - soft burrata cheese, creamy non-bitter rapini (I thought it was spinach!) sweet thick-skinned Castelvetrano olives (looked like small green pepper buds to me), and sharp, acidic tomatoes to contrast everything else in the plate.  The presentation of the dishes additionally matched the upscale ambience of Eleven.    We had drinks (yes at noon!) and dessert as well.  The Spice Cake ($10) was moist and amazing.  I loved their Ruby Red vodka ($10) cocktail.  Sweet and refreshing.    One of the best meals in my life!  Food, service, ambience, and price all 5/5!",

When we first arrived we appreciated the fact that Eleven offers valet parking for $6 since we were worried the lots in that area wouldn't stay open late enough on a Tuesday night.  We were seated upstairs. Our waiter, Miles, was incredibly attentive and caught on quickly that it was my birthday (and made sure to let the dessert chef know to add an adorable happy birthday sign to my dessert). He was helpful in helping some of our party order their entree and he helped us all pick a great wine. When dishes arrived, he made sure to explain any of the sauces or special features of the dish (like how all bread is made in-house).  I ordered the beef tenderloin which was perfect. It was served on top of a bed of a few gnocchi which were also delicious. Everyone at my table thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  Eleven would make for a great dinner for a romantic date night, celebrating a special occasion, or a nice meal with a client as it is a nice, quiet atmosphere. We didn't spend any time in the bar area, but it looked very nice with a few TVs. Our drinks were fantastic so I imagine the bar would also make for a nice time.",

    "text": "As a Big Burrito restaurant fan, I excitedly receive my birthday coupon every March and carefully decide which restaurant to return to or try for my birthday. This year, I chose to try Eleven with my husband.  I did not put much effort into my outfit for my birthday and immediately regretted this decision when I walked into this beautiful restaurant. It's modern and trendy while still feeling classy and elegant. I wished there was a J Crew or Banana Republic next door so I could quickly buy a new outfit and redo my entrance.  Even though I would have enjoyed experiencing the buzz of dining here on the weekend, we came here on a very quiet Monday night. When we first arrived, we literally had a large section of the 2nd floor all to ourselves. Our service for the entire evening was excellent! Our waitress was absolutely fabulous, and I believe her name was Liz.   With an impressive restaurant space and excellent service, I hoped that dinner would absolutely knock my socks off. It was very good, but didn't absolutely blow me away. Though everything was solid and well executed, I did not have anything so delicious that I've been dreaming about returning to have those items again.  We started with the Jumbo Lump Crab Crack, which was very tasty and had a nice balance of crab meat. My husband decided to go big and ordered the Prime Beef Ribeye. The cut of meat was enormous, but I thought that for $52 the flavors and tenderness could be better. As I had a free birthday entree coupon, I decided to have the Chef's Tasting Menu. The menu changes from time to time, but I had Tuna Tartare and Jubilee Hilltop Ranch Strip Steak. Sadly, I can't remember the 2nd course (even though I took a picture of it!). For dessert, my waitress said that I could order something not on the Tasting Menu, so I went for the Banana Cream Pie. Once again, everything was good, but for the price, none of my food was so incredible that I want to go back asap. My favorite item the entire meal might have been the Banana Cream Pie, which was beautiful, unique, and delicious.",

We did the brunch prix fixe ($29 for appetizer, entree and cocktail) and were happy with all of our choices. For my brunch cocktail I chose the Maple Smash which was delightful and I will be trying to copy the recipe at home. Mom had a sweet potato puree soup to start, very yummy. I was decidedly less healthy and ordered the last order of (thank you, Joe, our waiter!) beignets...out of this world. My entree, the steak and egg was delicious, but not quite hot, which I find to be a common problem with brunch. We were way too full for dessert. We left very full and happy...birthday brunch for mom a success!",

    "text": "Eleven is currently my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The menu is fantastic because it is gourmet and interesting without being 'over the top' foodie with things like eye balls and tongues. I'll stick with a regular cut of meat that is dressed up a bit, thank you! Service is top-notch every time from the valets to the person refilling the water. I love all of the little extras offered at the restaurant like a coat check and the complimentary after-dinner treats. Tip: If you don't have cash, you can pay for your valet and tip the valet on your credit card with your dinner check.   The wine list at Eleven is wonderful and I have yet to be disappointed by any of their reds by the glass or by the bottle. They offer a selection that caters to any wine budget, with bottles ranging from about $40 to more expensive choices that climb up to several hundred dollars. In addition to wine, I've had several cocktails and my boyfriend has had scotch, and both have been great.   The food is always timed right and is cooked to perfection, with sides that are just as good as the main course. My only complaint is that there is a lot of gratuitous oil and butter on pretty much everything. I am sure they would cook things healthier if I asked, but I don't like it when everything comes out glistening. I find that the portions tend to be generous, with the exception of scallops. 2 scallops for $18? That's a bit of a racket.   The menu is seasonal, so there is always something new to try when I go, which is great. That being said, I hope the spice cake is never taken off the menu as it is one of the best desserts I have ever had anywhere (I've been lucky enough to get it two visits in a row!).   Four stars instead of five because the ladies room is frequently trashed and there are a few tables upstairs that are bad (a long line of 2 tops where you feel like you have to keep your arms pinned to your side to avoid bumping the stranger next to you on the booth).   All in all, Eleven is superb. It is a bit pricey, but not crazy expensive and never disappoints. I hope that things stay great when Chef Derek moves on to new opportunities in a few weeks.",

Our waiter was very attentive and had recommendations for us for both drinks and dinner. We had crab cakes and eggplant for appetizer. Both were absolutely delicious. We had chicken and halibut for our entrees. The chicken was deliciously tender.  The halibut was very flaky. For desert we had chocolate cake which was decorated with a happy birthday chocolate.

    "text": "I can't imagine any of the Big Burrito restaurants getting anything less than five stars and Eleven is no exception.  I came here for brunch with my friend who was visiting from hotlanta and gave her yet another reason to return to Pittsburgh - the opportunity to dine at Eleven again. We both opted for the prefix because 1) it's an amazing deal for $29 and 2) it gives you the opportunity to sample different bites.   I had an AMAZING bloody Mary, followed by some tasty hash and then finished with an omelet.  I had to box half my meal and was so glad to enjoy this breakfast over two days. The little basket of tasty pastries served with brunch is also worth noting.   Service is great as well.  And you can make reservations ahead of time, which you should do, because this place is always busy.",

    "text": "While not quite in the stratospheric realm of, say, an Aureole in NY or a Citronelle in Washington, Pittsburgh's Eleven is an outstanding dining experience.  The food is creative, beautifully presented, and thoroughly enjoyable.  The service is attentive and professional, but not at all stuffy.  The wine list is extensive and they are able to recommend some amazing food-wine pairings.  All in all, thoroughly first rate.  I opted for the regular tasting menu.  The first sign of good things to come was the homemade bread.  It was yeasty and chewy and it took effort not to keep asking for more.  The first course was a small place of tuna sashimi on a \"lemon miso.\"  The citrus flavor of that sauce was perfect with the meltingly soft fish -- I mean, this was like cream cheese and lox from a parallel and far more elegant universe.          Then there was a porcini mushroom risotto garnished with a piece of taleggio cheese that melted into the rice.  It was exquisitely rich and gooey, and the pinot grigio I had with it balanced the dish perfectly.  What a treat.       This was followed, a plate of salmon, with morel mushrooms, lentils and fava beans.  The salmon was cooked impeccably -- moist but not raw or cold --  and the accompaniments made a great contrast.         Then there was lamb on polenta with some braised romaine lettuce.  This just knocked my socks off -- tremendous flavor.  Normally by this point in a tasting menu I am leaving half of each plate uneaten, but I scarfed down every bit of this dish.  Just first rate.       Desert was a banana tart with peanut butter flavored ice cream.  They paired this with an Australian port.  What a super combination.  The port had these tastes of brown sugar that just absolutely complemented the desert.  I only ate half the desert because I was stuffed, but I finished every drop of the port.       The food was $65 and the paired wines added $30 -- expensive for Pittsburgh I suspect, but a bargain for a native Washingtonian       I've been to Pittsburgh many times on business and never had better than an \"OK\" meal.  Now, at last, my quest is over !!",

    "text": "My husband and I were visiting for our Anniversary and asked the desk where we were staying \"The Renaissance\" where to have a wonderful dinner....they suggested \"Nine on Nine' or \"Eleven\".   We choose Eleven because when we were walking during the day we passed on our way to the Heinz Museum and stopped in...the decor was nice and the young woman at the front desk informed us the dress was Jacket but no tie needed...classy she said.   So, we booked on line through Yelp.   We arrived but had to wait at the front desk while the same young woman explained to the person where to buy a six pack at some package store.  Then while we were waiting we noticed people where in jeans and no jackets...we where dressed or over dressed at this point.  Finally, seated we did enjoy great service from our wait staff.  The wine was Frog's Leap Merlot which was nice rounded aged wine.  I had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras | $18 Belgian endive, arugula, brioche, persimmon, late harvest vinegar....the Foie Gras was over cooked, large portion but the endive had the right touch of sweetness that it was palatable.    My husband had the Tuna Tartare * | $12caviar, Meyer lemon mignonette, pea tendrils, white anchovy which again, was a nice size portion and my husband enjoyed it.  We both ordered the Roasted Squash & Parsnip Soup | $7crispy parsnip.  It was too spicy for me and my husband attempted to consume both bowls but was too much.  The waiter noted my concern on the spices and took it off  the tab.  We both order for our main Jamison Farm Lamb | $34 smoked shoulder, saddle, lamb bacon, local beets, potatoes, red onion marmalade, mint which was the highlight of this entire meal....cooked perfectly, the lamb bacon such a surprise and delight, along with the smoked shoulder left us completely satisfied...you might say it saved the night~  We had Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee sweet ricotta doughnut, poached pears for dessert which was not as creamy as I like Brulee to be.  Cappuccino and Espresso followed which was a nice finish to our meal.  My husband went to the front desk to ask for a cab to be called.  He had to return three time to order a cab which did not sit well with him.  Overall, the wait staff and actual meal were enjoyable with the highlight being the lamb!  Disappointment on dress code not being True to form and the presence of the front reception person lacked higher standards for a fine dining atmosphere.",

    "text": "I'd have to say Big Burrito's take on Contemporary American at Eleven is a success.   I thought my food was very well prepared and delicious. Prior to the start of our meal we were presented with scallops crusted with poppy and seasonings which were really excellent, and to be honest I don't even like scallops very much - they may even have been my favorite part of my entire meal.  I also ordered the three green salad with goat cheese which was really enjoyable albeit not outstanding.  Then again - it was a simple green salad, how memorable can it get? My entree was the seafood tasting which included potato crusted sea scallops, Pacific salmon & jumbo lump crab cakes.  I particularly enjoyed the salmon & crab cakes. For dessert I ordered a creme brulee, which frankly was not very good.  They went to town searing the top.  Way too seared.  Eleven has a wide variety of \"designer\" cocktails which were all very good. I don't really want to give this restaurant a 4 star rating, but it doesn't deserve three stars either.  It may not have been one of the very best restaurants I have eaten at, but I think for Pittsburgh it is pretty exceptional. I read various reviews and heard many opinions that felt Eleven is rather pricey.  While it may be more expensive than many other restaurants in Pittsburgh, I think it should be noted that Eleven is really rather on par with the pricing of other \"hip & new\" restaurants in other American cities.",

    "text": "I live in Chicago, where I have access to a plethora of excellent restaurants, but Eleven is quite simply my all-time favorite restaurant.  My family and I come here often to celebrate big events - birthdays and new jobs and such.  It's expensive, but very much worth it.   The service staff is very good.  From the hostess who will find you a table even when you forgot to make reservations (although especially on Fri and Sat it's a good idea to have them) to the person who brings around the basket of amazing breads (yeah, there's one person who's primary job is that as far as I can tell) everyone is always friendly and polite.  The server is usually attentive and food and drinks come up quickly, although when I was there most recently they did fall down a bit on that front.  Amusingly, if you have food wrapped up to take home (and if you don't have it in you to eat every bite, then you'll want to do that), they give you a claim ticket for it and you pick it up at the coat check when you leave. Thus, your dining is not disturbed by the sight of leftovers.  My favorite thing to order is the vegetarian tasting menu.  You never know what to expect - it's often the thing on the list that you're least sure of that turns out to be the best.  The soups here are transcendently good and if it weren't a fancy place I would pick my bowl up and lick it clean (actually, I do it anyway to avoid missing a drop of the deliciousness, but my parents won't let me).  Also really great salads and lots of excellent vegetables.  Big Burrito makes a point of buying fresh, local produce, which is not only tasty, but also environmentally conscious - yay! They have a really good selection of wines and cocktails, and the servers are great about helping to chose one that will match your meal. And if you can't make up your mind, they'll let you taste some before you order. Also, you can add a set of wine pairings to the tasting menu for (I believe) $30, which I highly recommend doing.  Each one is always the perfect compliment to the course (the sommelier is obviously another very talented member of the staff), and, if you're like me and still learning about wines, it's a great chance to broaden your horizons. Last, but certainly not least, if you don't order a tasting menu (which includes dessert) make sure you leave room.  The pastry chef here is a genius! Whether you like chocolate, fruit, or cheese at the end of your meal, you will not be disappointed - in fact, you'll probably want to order multiple things.  Plus, many of them come with unusual flavors of ice cream that will raise an eyebrow, at least until you try them and discover that they're perfect! Basically, I can not rave about Eleven enough, so you'll just have to go and experience it for yourself!",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of the Big Burrito group (FYI, if you're not on their mailing list, get there ASAP because the birthday coupon/s they send you are well worth it).  Up until recently, I had only eaten at Mad Mex and Soba and really wanted to try the others.  I always knew Eleven was on the more expensive side, but my husband, knowing someone who works there, and having the 'inside' scoop on what to order, we decided to take the plunge, knowing we were in for a $80 dinner for 2 (which turned out to be a good estimation).  Drinks: we got cocktails...Tea-jito and Elev-ade.  Very very very tasty.  Very good.  Appetizer: tuna tartare.   My husband is not the raw fish/tartare type but when he said 'it's your choice honey', I chose it.  Usually I choose to get something I know he likes, but we were at Eleven for gosh sakes...I'm not getting the soft pretzel or perogies. Plus, he needs to eat outside of the box sometimes, and it's my job as a wife to be sure he tries new things.  Anywho...amazingly great.  Not as great as La Casa (which is my all-time favorite) but quite up there.  I'd say if La Casa is a 10, Eleven is a 9.5.  Entrees: Husband was told to get the Eleven burger.  He IS the burger type, and quite the burger connoisseur at that.  He loved it.   I had a bite.  I also loved it.  I should have gotten it too.  Instead, I got the crab cake sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I wouldn't rate it 'Eleven' good.  Maybe I shouldn't have eaten it as a sandwich, but I would rate it as a 7 out of 10.  The whole experience was great, and as pricy as expected.  Only because of my crab cake sandwich would I say that it was only worth slightly less than we paid, but my husband said it was worth every penny.  So overall, I give it a huge thumbs up and we will be going back, but not ordering the crab cake sandwich.",

An appetizer, entree & cocktail for $25!! Cant beat that! My mom ordered the scallops app and I ordered the smoked salmon. Both were amazing, although I did like my moms scallops better than my salmon. As our entrees my mom ordered the Mushroom, Sweet Pepper & Goat Cheese Omelet and I ordered the Rock Shrimp, Asparagus, Ham and White Cheddar Omelet. Both were very very good.

I finally had to flag down another server and ask him to find our waiter so that I could order more wine.    Our food was good, but not amazing by any standard.

We were seated promptly (and they quickly added the additional spots needed) and Tom (our waiter) handled the group with ease.  The food was extraordinary--everyone raved about their orders, things came out quickly and at the end, Tom had no problem doing individual checks!  It was one of the best group dining experiences I have ever had!  Highly recommend Eleven!!",

    "text": "I am not sure how the majority of stars is 5 on this restaurant.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  We got a table upstairs and our waitress Megan came over.  She had 0 personality and you can tell she just wanted to keep making the check more expensive so her tip would be higher.  She didn't even introduce herself, we only knew her name because it said it on the check.  If you are a waitress at a high class restaurant like that one I expect better service.  I ordered the hanger steak and my husband ordered the tagliatelle.  As we waited we were given one slice of bread each.  Was good, but we wanted more because it was so small as if it was a sample.  Our food came, first impression of my hanger steak was this is so small.  Honestly, my hanger steak should of been on the appetizer list, that's how small it was.  My husbands first impression of his tagliatelle was it smelled like semen.  No, I am not trying to be funny it 100% smelt like semen.  I don't know why he tried a bite but he did.  He couldn't eat it, from the smell.  Is this place special sauce semen or something?  Honestly, I don't know how no one has ever said something about it.  My poor husband was sick afterwards, I had to go home and make him and I something to eat. Since his smelt like semen and mine was so small I was still hungry. Never again will I go to this restaurant.  IF YOU HAVE A BIG BURRITO GROUP COUPON GO TO CASBAH 100X BETTER.",

Food: No complaints, solid food very nicely plated and prepared. Service: Professional waiter. Coat check was polite and swift.   Value: Price was actually really fair for what you get. This is an upscale restaurant that warrants visiting more than once. Extra: I was happy with the valet, the coat check, the hostess, the server, and the food. Now with that being said it was not any more amazing than other restaurants of this caliber. I should probably give it five stars, but Eleven does not have \"the its the most amazing restaurant of its kind\" vibe.",

    "text": "My friend and I have decided to make Pittsburgh a \"moms\" trip every year, and this past weekend was our second visit. One of the big things we look forward to are really great meals (without the kids, etc.). A few people from home recommended Eleven so we decided to make reservations. For a few days out, there weren't many options for times, but I take that as a good sign. Our reservations were for 9pm on Saturday and we were seated right away, at a large booth, which was nice. Our waitress was very nice at first and very helpful in regards to the wine menu. She went over many of the different options and really pushed a few of the middle of the road bottles, which wasn't a problem. However, as both my friend and I agree that we'd like to spend the most money on food, over wine, we decided to go with a cheaper bottle of cab and and focus our attention on ordering whatever our little hearts desired from the food menu. Our waitress did not seem pleased when we told her our choice of wine; she genuinely seemed put out. I'm not sure if she makes commission from wine sales or if it was just that we didn't take her suggestions, but she didn't seem happy. Her service was fine for the rest of the meal, but she was not nearly as friendly as when we sat down.   Ultimately, our food was wonderful. We both got the beet salad (very good, fresh) and I got the strip, which was cooked perfectly. Great portion sizes and great presentation; I don't think you feel at all that you're paying too much for too little. I'm not sure we will be back, as there are so many great restaurants to try in Pittsburgh, but I'm not at all sad that we went!",

    "text": "The overall theme of Eleven is balance.  The pork belly was like a gift from God: the saltiness of the grits balanced by the sweet maple gastrique; the soft tender pork belly enhanced by the crispy apple slices; and the brown color of the seared belly offset by the bright greens.  Truly a perfectly conceived dish.  Did I mention that it tasted AMAZING?  The scallops were the only thing that didn't blow my mind.  They were good, just not out of this world.  My main dish was hands down the best lamb dish I've ever had.  If you like lamb, get the lamb.  Again, perfectly balanced.  The lamb, smoked shoulder, mint, lamb bacon, and red onion marmalade could all be tasted in different combinations.  You could make every bite different and every bite equally amazing.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly executed, and beautiful to look at.  Finally, there's a reason the chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar is at the top of their dessert menu.  This is not your kid's Snickers bar, THIS IS YUMMY TIME FOR ADULTS.  It all comes together and again, is perfectly balanced.  The cold sweet ice cream, the salty smooth peanut/preztel filling sitting on a thin dense brownie (acted almost like the crust).  Truly an incredible finish to an amazing meal.  The service was outstanding and probably the most personable service I've ever had.  Our waiter Daniel was extremely courteous, informative, nice, and helped make our night one to remember.",

I do hate it when the change the menu and take someone off I really like but at least it they do change. The seafood sampler is a must try.

We ordered the seafood medley and an AK halibut, both of which were quite good. The only knock is the cleaning of the scallop, which wasn't as we would have expected. The blueberry pie dessert was reasonably sized and quite flavorful.  I would definitely bring friends, colleagues, or a date here again.",

Our larger party was escorted to the second level into one of the private rooms for our meal.  As I oft do when somebody else is paying, I quickly gravitated towards the most expensive items on the menu. For this go around, it was the foie-gras appetizer, beef tenderloin (ok this was second most, but I love beets and horseradish). As can be reasonably expected with any foie gras dish, it represented completely over-the-top decadence, and I Ioved every bite of it. Melt in your mouth and the brioche had just enough crunch and texture to complement the rich treat. Tenderloin was also cooked to perfection and SO TENDER I wanted to cry (and probably did a little). I ordered the sorbet for dessert (since somewhere along the way I've convinced myself that eating sorbet is tantamount to a 3-4 mile job), but regretted not ordering the peanut-pretzel candy bar that my neighbors ordered.

The Service is good -  most of the time very personable and I am glad I came - even wishing I could stay a while - but normally I have to drive back to wherever I am staying.  but the odd occasion, I get a waiter who is full of himself and is doing you a favor by serving you. Eleven is clearly a place \"to be seen\" and the staff seem to know that.  The only other thing is their beer selection - I understand they are all about locally sourced produce and craft beers, but it wouldn't harm to have a few beers on hand that I may have heard of. I am not suggesting that they start pouring Bud Light - Anything but! But I would love it if they had some European Brews on hand, such as Chimay.  A great place to go for a nice night out - no matter which side of the premise you are dining on.",

    "text": "So a friend insisted that I try Eleven, but I was always a little put off by the fact that it was owned by the same people who own Mad Mex (okay, kind of bland) and Soba (decent, overpriced). However, the GF and I actually woke up in time for lunch on Sunday, and we weren't really in the mood for typical brunch food, so we tried out Eleven.  The ambiance is really nice. It kind of gives off a hotel-lounge feel (for Sunday brunch, at least), and it's relaxed yet classy. I'm also a big fan of the seating arrangement.  We both got the brunch prix fixe, which is $25 for an appetizer, an entree, and a drink. I got a Bloody Mary, the crab cake, and spaghetti with shrimp, crab, lobster, and lima beans. Everything was good, but not superb. Dessert (not included in the prix fixe) was good, but I'm not really a dessert person, so I don't remember what I got.  Now, the food was all pretty good, but the show stopper was actually the bread. They freshly bake everything on the premise, and each bread basket has tiny scones, blueberry muffins, croissants, and I think an orange cranberry bread. I'm told it changes daily based on what the baker decides on making, but everything I had was top notch. Seriously, it sounds kind of stupid, but I would actually go to Eleven just for the bread. They could have charged me $10 for each basket, and I would not have minded at all.  I wasn't sure whether to give Eleven a 4 or a 5, and I really wish Yelp did half-stars, but I ultimately decided to bump it up to a 5, because the bread really is THAT good. All in all, one of my Top 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

Not a lot of vegan options, but the chef is always willing to make something if you let him know. I love the seats outside in the front because my puppy is usually with me (and hungry!)

On the good side, they were very good about accommodating our giant party of 16 ( even if it was 6pm on a Wednesday night)   Before bringing out our food, we got these little sandwiches with onions and salmon caviar - tasty! Then came our oysters, from Long Island, served with a nice, spicy pepper sauce and some milder one. For main course, I tried the beef tenderloin, pork chop, and tuna. I ordered the beef medium and it came nicely red on the inside, leaning towards medium-rare which worked fine for me since that's what I usually go with anyway. The fingerling potatoes were a tad undercooked and hard. The pork chop was served on bacon grits, and that was the best part of that dish. The pork chop itself was bland and boring. Tuna was alright, nothing special.  For dessert, I had apricot semifreddo covered with somekindofdarkberry syrup drizzle, it was ok - tasty ice cream.",

Our out of town guests and guests from the Burgh raved about the presentation of each of the courses.  They also loved sampling 3 different desserts for their final course.  Eleven went above and beyond by printing menus for each our guests and placing on each place setting.   It was a nice gesture and a pleasant surprise (we didnt ask the restaurant to do so).    We had fun reading the descriptions as each course was served.    The restaurant even created a unique four course vegetarian childs dinner.

    "text": "My husband and I visited for our first time in Pittsburgh. We were adventurous and ordered the scallop appetizer, neither of us had ever tried them. It was pretty, not a texture I loved but that's not their fault, of course. It came with a small tasty salad. While waiting for food, we were offered some bread. I loved the tomato focaccia! My husband sprung for the steak, which was the most amazing steak either of us have ever tried. The only steak he has eaten without A1. It was served with parmesan potato tots which were fun and delicious. My pork chop was so juicy and beautiful! Turns out I do not like beets and there were quite a few on the plate, but it also came with two of the most amazing onion rings. It only had 3 slices of grilled peach slices, which I was looking forward to more. On to dessert. OMG! We got the banana cream pie. It is not your ordinary banana cream pie! It is heaven on a plate. The only downfall was that my husband ordered a Pepsi, and for each refill, we were charged $3.50. So over $10 for 3 small glasses of an alcohol free beverage. Bummer that we weren't informed. But overall we had a wonderful experience thanks to the fantastic food and our excellent server, Margaret. And to top it off, at the very end of our meal, we were brought two squares of salted caramels which was awesome. It was a lovely dining experience, but even so, the prices were steep.",

I couldn't have been happier with the experience.  I made the reservation on open table and noted that it was her birthday and requested any seating with a nice view or other differentiator if they had it. We walked in and were promptly seated in a nice private booth that overlooked the downstairs bar. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable. He checked on us often, but not too often. I also appreciated that he mentioned my girlfriends birthday without bringing out the waitstaff to sing or any other annoying show.  The food was excellent as well. They brought around breads, and the salt focaccia was delicious. I had the beef tenderloin and she had the roasted chicken. The beef was great and the fingerling potatoes that came with it may be the best potatoes I've ever had. I had a few bites of her chicken as well and it was equally as good. For desert we had the chocolate peanut butter candy bar and it was amazing. They even went out of their way and wrote happy birthday on a separate piece of chocolate for my girlfriend.  Overall eleven was a great experience and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. A class act staff and delicious food.",

Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable on the menu items. I appreciate that he gave us an honest opinion when we asked for suggestions. We had the scallops and pork belly for an appetizer and the lamb and beef tenderloin for dinner. The scallops practically melted in your mouth (and just to note, I don't like seafood!) and the pork belly flavors complemented each other well. My tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare and tasted amazing. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but my husband devoured his dish and said it was the best tasting lamb he's ever had. My drink of choice was a glass of Cabernet and my hubby had a lemon drop martini. Their wine list is a little pricey for the common folk like me (my glass of wine was $16 and many of their bottles started around $80), but hey, it was my anniversary. Finally, we finished off our meal with their peanut butter pretzel dessert, which was out of this world good. If you're in any way a fan of peanut butter, you should definitely try this dessert!  This was by far one of the best \"special occasion\" dinners I've ever had.  I certainly can't afford to go here every night (if only!), but I'll definitely be back!  Quick note: For any girls out there wondering what to wear - I wore jeans and a nice top and my hubby wore jeans with a nice sweater and I didn't feel like we were out of place at all.",

My medium burger didn't have a trace of pink; my friend's medium steak was bloody. Then there were the pierogies, covered with caramelized onions, sweeter than any onions I have ever tasted, as sweet as corn syrup.  Yuk, yuk and yuk.  To top it off, the wait staff couldn't even keep my glass full.  It went empty and sat there at least twice.  My friend is a 'foodie.' He paired the too-sweet pierogies with some prosciutto and declared, 'I get what they're trying to do.'  Maybe food can be art, but I don't want food that makes me think.  I want food that tastes good.  I don't think that's a lot to ask.",

    "text": "After trying a few of the other Big Burrito restaurants, I finally got around to the 'flagship'.  I arrived early (about 15 minutes before 5 PM), and the valets were kind enough to park my car for free since they weren't set up yet.  Off to a good start!    When I got inside, the floor wasn't open yet, so I settled in the bar and was attended to (mostly) by the bartender, although he was understandably distracted with setup.  I settled in the corner with a book and a glass of iced tea, and the tea was fixed perfectly... rarer than one might think, here in the frozen north.  The restaurant itself is GORGEOUS; whoever decorated this space deserves an award.  It is well lit without being bright, warm without being twee, and elegant without being uncomfortable.  All in all an absolutely beautiful place to eat.  Upon getting a table, the wait staff was very attentive... another plus.  My waitress was superb, always being there at the precise moment I needed her, never intrusive.  All this, despite my being the only person at my table - and I know all too well how much restaurants hate single diners.  Rebekah, you were phenomenal.  So why three stars?  Well... all the things I have mentioned were each a star.  Unfortunately, the food was very forgettable.  I ordered the shrimp and grits appetizer.  Presentation was impeccable, but the shrimp were jumbo shrimp and tough as boot leather.  They were served on a thin layer of something creamy (presumably grits, though not like any I'd ever seen) and some collards that tasted decent but were almost tougher than the shrimp.  Tastewise the dish was acceptable (although far from delicious), but texturewise it was a total wreck.    So... on to the main course.  I ordered gnocchi, which is one of my favorites.  The gnocchi themselves were homemade and quite good.  The dish was served with mushrooms, baby lima beans and spinach, and again, the greens were ridiculously tough.  The mushrooms had a wonderful flavor, but the texture of bubblegum.  Once again, presentation won out over edibility... I don't get the impression that anyone in the kitchen actually eats any of the dishes they prepare, or else they would realize that taste and texture are even more important than being pretty.  Dessert was a pineapple cake, which was delicious and served with a very tart, sour sorbet.  The sweetness of the cake and the tartness of the sorbet were well matched, and this would have been a definite five-star dessert except for the presence of... crystallized ginger?!  Who thought this added something to the flavors of this dish?  I think it must have been put on the dish for decoration, but a piece of this in your mouth at the wrong time would definitely stomp on all the other flavors.  All in all, this is a wonderful space; the staff is excellent; if they get a chef who learns how to serve food people actually eat instead of look at, it will truly be a 5+ star experience.  As it is?  An excellent place to see and be seen... not to eat.",

The soup was delicious and a nice departure from the Three Green Salad I always get it. It is also not made with dairy products so it's light!

We ended up splitting the rigatoni mixed with butternut squash and kale, sprinkled with pecorino romano cheese as an appetizer, which was fantastic! I had trouble ordering the main course since there were so many delicious sounding options, but went with the seafood sampler. My favorite was the scallops and sword fish, absolutely delicious! I was also able to appreciate a bite of the beef tenderloin, which was so soft and easy to chew, a must for my type of meat! We topped it off with ice cream and the creme brulee. Highly recommend this place !",

I was able to find parking in the lot across the street and my BF found street parking. I anticipate it is a bit harder during the busy times, but they do offer Valet Parking, which is nice. The hostess was very friendly as well as the bartender. The ambiance is very sleek and nice. Makes for a nice place for a date, family dinner or just a get together with friends. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Every course of our meal was better than the one before, if that's possible! We had a lovely date night and left full, but not stuffed like a turkey on Thanksgiving. We'll definitely be back!",

I would go back for that lobster roll. For dessert we got creme brulee it was creamy and not too sweet. Perfect. Since it was her birthday they came out with chocolates they made.

The happy hour is a $7 menu with select drinks and appetizers. I tried the cucumber mule which was very crisp and refreshing with fresh cucumber and ginger. I also ordered the calamari from the happy hour menu which was quite delicious a the portion was great for the happy hour price.  I finished with a dirty martini which you have free selection of you gin on during happy hour. This was a pleasant surprise and a welcome one indeed. On my visit it appeared that care was taken behind the bar when crafting drinks which is something I look for. I don't want drinks just sloshed together and thrown in front of me. The presentation goes a long way. This seems like it would be a nice romantic date night spot and I look forward to coming back.",

The food has quality that is beyond most of the restaurants in Pittsburgh. Flavors burst in a setting that boasts your typical New York City style establishment without even trying.   Love this place, and the best part is it's not even trying that hard.  It is what it is and I love the effortless quality that 11 brings to Pgh. Dishes that I tried were the lamb chops and steak both prepared perfectly, Seasoned  very well, without any hesitation on my part. Ate it like it was my last meal on earth. Certainly going to miss this place. I hope it keeps up the quality because it really is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh no doubt!  Love it!   Make one in California please for my sake.

That said, I had the opportunity to try a little bit of everything here, thanks to a company holiday party.  There were about 15 tapas-portioned plates due to the nature of the party, but I was a fan of everything I tried-- even down to their roasted vegetables.  The seafood (scallops and sea bass) was more on the uncooked side than I'd normally prefer,  but that could well be my unsophisticated knowledge of how fish should be cooked. The lighting is on ther minimal side, very Manhattan-esque. I'd definitely come back if I'm ever in town again.",

Using those cards at a Casbah or Eleven brunch is so great. It works out to a free app, entree and cocktail!  Anyhow, we had a nice brunch at Eleven and each ordered the aforementioned prix fixe.   Between the two of us we had a Bloody Mary and a Sage 75. The short rib hash and the avocado toast for apps. And the steak and egg, as well as the burger for entrees.   I can say that each dish was excellent in taste and well executed. The short rib hash in particular was delicious and perfectly composed, sized and delivered. The poached egg on top was perfect as well.   The hanger (hangar?) steak was really really good.   The drinks were delicious and the service was very nice as well.

I made reservations for 12 people at 8:00pm on a Wednesday. We arrived 10 minutes early, was told by the host that they were running on schedule, but could wait at the bar while the table was being prepared. We went to the bar, my friend suggested we take a birthday shot, but was told by the bartender they don't do shots here. She didn't even suggest making it straight. They also don't serve red bull or grape vodka either. So we settled for wine, which was underpoured. Then finally after 8:30 we were taken to our table, we should have known then that the service would be slow and relaxed.   The dinner menu is fairly selective so some of my friends chose to order off of the tavern menu, which we appreciated. The calamari was delicious, but a little overpriced for the portion size you receive. Also enjoyed the complimentary bread. I had the sea scallops and they were delicious! We brought our own birthday cake for dessert, the servers put the candles on, lit them and brought it out to the table which was nice. We offered them some of the leftovers but opted to take the rest home, and then the server said it dropped on the floor after she had wrapped it up.",

Food was good overall. Below is what we had: - bread: Out of the three options they had, we like the sea-salted one the most. Having said that, I am a but disappointed that the bread is not hot / warm. If Cheesecake Factory can serve warm bread, I expect any higher-end restaurant to do better. - Oysters: They are small oysters but they are great. Forget about the sauces, you dont need those. - Seafood Tasting: Scallop was perfect. Halibut and crab cake was over-cooked to my liking. The crabmeat they uses were good and big, I just wish that it was more juicy.  Chef's tasting menus - Yellowtail Sashimi: Best Yellowtail Sashimi I had. Fish was fresh. The whole dish had a great combination. It was the highlight of the night. Must-try if you like seafood. - Seared Rare Tuna: Interesting dish, and I like this a lot. Tuna was done perfectly. Rock shrimp was a surprise. Dried tomatoes was a nice touch.  The only issue is the chorizo, which was so strong and over-favored the tuna. I wish the tuna was paired with something lighter. - Strip Steak: It was perfect. (We had it \"rare\" instead of \"medium-rare\") - Black Forest Torte: we later realize that we can pick other dessert instead, though this one is \"included\" in the chef's tasting menus. I am glad we did not change it anything else.",

For those who aren't aware, the Big Burrito restaurant group comprises many of Pittsburgh's popular restaurants - Kaya, Mad Mex, Casbah, etc.).   We made what my dinner partner called an \"AARP reservation\" (dinner at 5 PM on a Thursday), and eagerly arrived at 4:45. Someone took our coats as we came in, and even as some of the first people there, we already loved the ambiance. Service was excellent - my water glass was never less than half full. They offered us drinks immediately, and we tried a pomegranate & egg-white cocktail that was absolutely delicious without being overly sweet. My dinner partner is gluten free, and we had called ahead to inform the restaurant. Everyone seemed to be aware upon our arrival, and we were promptly guided towards safe menu options. We ordered a foie gras appetizer with Calvados prunes - deliciously browned, and very unique - along with a yellowtail sashimi appetizer with uni foam. The portions were relatively small, but not out of place for a restaurant of this type.  We decided to split a salmon entree on a bed of roasted root vegetables. One of the best-cooked, most flavorful salmon entrees I have ever enjoyed. The fish was fresh and perfectly seasoned, and the accompaniments were tasty and balanced. We split a raspberry macaron and creme brulee for dessert, and it couldn't have been more delicious.  Overall, a satisfying, wonderful meal, and one I would love to experience again.",

    "text": "I was here for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and he had the hanger steak and fries (it was his birthday after all!)  My sandwich was so flavorful!  The ham and cornichon played off of each other well and the dijon and arugula contributed with a nice bite to round out the flavors.  I just wish the chicken was a little more tender and juicy; the heart of the breast was, but the edges were drying out.  That's okay - the fries saved it.  I judge a good fry based on whether it needs ketchup.  These do not - they're crisp on the outside and tender on the inside with a wonderful seasoning sprinkled on top.  Ketchup merely enhanced the flavor of the potatoes.  He enjoyed his steak, though would have preferred it to be more well done.  Our server, who wasn't phased by us asking questions and not knowing protocol (like the numbered tags you're given when you get something to go - it's waiting for you behind the hostess stand the the coat check room?) suggested he try medium instead of medium well for that particular cut.  While she was knowledgeable about the food and made a good recommendation, his personal preference would have been for more well done.  Pros: dishes are crafted with attention to flavors, servers are attentive and polite, plating is excellent, coffee service is fancypants! Cons: the host couldn't have been less friendly or more happy to see us leave - we were more casual as it was lunch service, a faux pas apparently, or perhaps we looked too young and riff-raffy to be spending money there. That part will make me think twice before returning, though our server made up for his unpleasantness.",

It has that cool urban loft feel. I love the outdoor seating. I love the huge garage door that opens up the entire restaurant. I love the upstairs intimate dining area. I love the bar area. I love love love it all!   Remember to keep an open mind and an open wallet, because you'll need it!   First off, cocktails....hello! I ordered the Summer Strawberry and my friend ordered the Leven-ade. We were so confused because the waitress set them down in front of us and I had the yellow colored drink and she had the pink colored drink. We thought she had mixed them up.  But she hadn't.  I swear mine tasted more Lemonadie and tart and my friends tasted more fruity. So to solve that issue, we switched! And all was right in the world again....   I had heard over and over again that the portions were incredibly small. So with that being said, and not wanting to be a cheapskate by ordering only an app, I ordered the Asparagus Salad. The portion was big to my surprise...and utter joy. Score one! The asparagus was fresh and crisp with balsamic drizzle and pieces of thinly sliced pork (properly called Lomo...which I totally had to look up the meaning of, don't worry!) and parmesan. Perfection!   I ordered the Tuna because I can rarely resist tuna if it's on the menu. It was perfectly cooked....or uncooked. There's really no other way to order Tuna then to order it rare. Go rare or go home! It was fantastic! It really out shined the mixture of rice below.  I also really liked the slight green olive taste in the dish. Score two!  My friend got the Hanger Steak rare as well and it was equal in amazingness.  I, of course, had to try it!   I'm a fillet girl all the way, but the way the steak was cooked made the flavor just right!   So we left, empty wallets but full bellies. And I'm totally ok with that!",

    "text": "Eleven was one of the best fancier restaurants I've ever been to.  Although my server was a little slow while bringing my drink, the delicious food made up for it completely.  For my first course, I ordered the Hudson Valley Foie Gras, and it was so, so delicious.  It was properly prepared and I appreciated how Eleven made sure their supplier prepared the birds without cages.  It was so delicious, I felt my mouth actually start to drool!  For my entree, I ordered the Lamb Loin medium well.  It was very, very yummy and they prepared it well to my request.  Lastly, I ordered the chocolate candy bar for dessert.  Although it was very good, it did not compare to the rest of the meal and was just a little better than what you would see at any other fine dining restaurant.  Don't let the name \"candy bar\" fool you, it featured chocolate ice cream, frosting, and what I believe was chocolate cake.  I appreciated how, since this was my first time visiting Eleven, my server gave me a complimentary chocolate truffle with my order!  The atmosphere was very nice, although the music skewed towards the louder side, making it a little difficult to communicate with my server.  Other than that, Eleven served terrific food with great service!",

    "text": "Inconsistencies really irk me. For instance, I read Whitley S's review (awesome review BTW) & have to say our experience with the hostess couldn't have been more different! The hostess is the first person you encounter when you walk into a restaurant. He or she sets the tone for the entire evening, & while it can always go up or down from there, that first impression is extremely important.  We arrived for dinner at 5 on Saturday night & were lucky enough to score one of the street paid parking spots right in front of the door practically. $2 to park YAY! Especially when I knew that I was about to shell out a great deal of money for dinner. Hey the little things make me happy.  It was cold out so we both had on coats. We walked in the door (opened by the valet thank you) & waited behind another couple that was speaking to the hostess. When they were finished the young lady at the hostess stand simply stared at us, no hello, no welcome to eleven do you have a reservation, nothing. Just stared like we had horns. Finally I walked up and informed her that we had reservations for 5pm. Of course I couldn't remember which name I put it under, but it was quickly located. No small talk during the process, just silence as though we were really interrupting her conversation with the 4 other people who were gathered at the hostess stand. Then a cursory Michelle will show you to your table. No enjoy your dinner, no may I take your coats, nada. Which is actually really inconvenient as we were shown to an upstairs shared booth with very little room to lay our coats on the seat beside us. But a minor detail, I just hope that management reads these reviews so that the problem can be addressed.   Our server, Brian, was very knowledgeable & very attentive. Water glasses were never empty, as there were at least 4 different servers who were attending to bread, water, plate removal, etc. My wine arrived quickly as did my husband's martini. Both were excellent.   The menu changes daily, with a very delicious tasting menu with wine pairings available in both a vegetarian and a meat option. As it was early (we had 7:30 tickets to a show) we weren't terribly hungry, so opted for two entrees & Chris ordered a salad. Bread arrives with butter and is dolled out, which I actually like. I hate the idea of restaurants throwing away every breadbasket that isn't eaten. It's such a waste! Bread selections were semolina, salted focaccia, and a wheat option.   Chris's salad was very good; the croutons had been coated in balsamic vinegar. Dressing was light and the field greens were very fresh and peppery. I wish there had been a salad option that had more vegetables, I did feel as though my meal was greatly lacking in the vegetable department. They did have a beet salad available but I think the goat cheese in that option negated any health benefits of the beets.   Dinner arrived quickly and beautifully presented. We both opted for another glass of wine to accompany our dinner, which were also promptly delivered. I ordered the seafood sampler, which was a crab cake, grilled salmon, and scallops. I opted to try the risotto instead of the grits that it was supposed to come with, a substitution that was easily accommodated. Chris had the grilled swordfish with sausage and mussels and fingerling potatoes. The seafood sampler was topped with a delicious lemony/horseradishy slaw. I'm telling you I would never have thought to combine lemon and horseradish but it was absolutely divine. Just a small amount but it was perfect and light and just enough horseradish to really feel it in your sinuses. Awesome! I will say it was served with grilled pieces of lemon, which weren't my favorite. The rind on lemon can be bitter. If you weren't careful and ended up with a piece with your fish, it had the potential to really ruin that bite. The scallops and salmon were perfectly cooked and the crab cake was loaded with shredded crabmeat. The risotto was creamy and delicious. All in all, my entree was fantastic. Chris raved about his swordfish, mussels, and sausage. We both cleaned our plates (with the exception of the grilled lemons). The portion sizes were perfect as we weren't so full we thought we might die by the time we had finished. I hate that feeling and love when a restaurant is smart about portions.   For dessert we ordered the caramel popcorn ice cream and the chocolate caramel ice cream. It was beautifully presented as well, and since we were celebrating Chris's birthday, the even included a large piece of milk chocolate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in white chocolate. A very sweet touch that was greatly appreciated. Some raspberries, blackberries, two little chocolate chip cookies, and a little coconut macaroon accompanied the ice cream. The ice creams were delicious, the perfect end to a delicious meal. Be prepared for the bill though. Almost $200 for the two of us (3 drinks each, 2 entrees, 1 salad, 1 dessert, tip).",

    "text": "Eleven is hands-down, without fail one of Pittsburgh's best restaurants. I have eaten here a number of times and have had nothing but great eating experiences.  Here's a tidbit from a review that I did on my blog (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fintrepidmoves.blogspot.com%2F&s=1692c55f8c11f3f0648e4d274291e27dc514592b7d6c1fa6c30178740736ada1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">intrepidmoves.blogspot.c...</a>) back in October of 2012.  \"Seasonal Heaven.... Eleven. was. delicious....I'm a big fan of innovative, fresh food - and that is exactly what this restaurant offered....Being a big fan of beets, I started with a beet salad. These roasted red beets were dressed with a light vinaigrette and were mixed with pumpkin seeds. This was an interesting October touch, unique and delicious, and while overall I enjoyed the meal, the salty roasted seeds made the dish, to me, seem a bit too salty. Didn't stop me from eating every bite though! \"  Dinner is on the pricier side, but well worth it. This is a great restaurant for a special occasion. This summer I went with a group of eight or so people and we had a private room upstairs - one very vibrant woman from Scranton, unfamiliar with the eats of Pittsburgh - just couldn't get over how great the restaurant was. She asked the waiter to have the manager come up so that she could give him her compliments. She told him that she has never been to a restaurant where every single person in a large group like this could speak so highly of each and every single one of their meals.   The only 'disappointing' moment I have ever had at Eleven was when I was at dinner with the group mentioned above - my friend Maura and I decided to splurge on a pricier dollar bottle of white wine - annnnnnd it didn't come chilled. I generally don't complain at restaurants, but as Maura's mother (vibrant woman mentioned previously) said, \"you tell them, it's a 60 dollar bottle of white wine, and it's going to need to be chilled.\" So we took that route - added some please and thank you's - and the bottle was immediately on ice. I wouldn't have expected to have to ask that question at this establishment - but, mistakes happen.  My most recent experience was for lunch at the Tavern (the bar part of the restaurant which has a different menu). Always on a hunt for a good Bloody Mary - I was very satisfied. The bar area is beautiful - high ceilings, dark wood tables and chairs - a very calming atmosphere. I had their famous fried brussels sprouts, and mussels that were to die for.   What it comes down to is that you just can't go wrong with Eleven. The Big Burrito Restaurant Group nailed it with this place.",

The Pimms cup was good but not memorable, but the tea-ojito was well done.  For dinner we went with tuna & lamb.  Both were excellent; the lamb was done three ways; the saddle, pulled lamp, & lamb...wait for it...bacon.  It tasted like bacon, but it was lamb, so that automatically makes it more awesome.  We actually got dessert, too...peanut butter something or other.    Everything is garnished well, plated well, and executed well.  I don't have anything bad to say about the food or service in the restaurant, just expect a $50pp check.

I have been here many times for various occasions, tried many items on the menu, and have yet to find something to be upset about the food, the drinks, or the service.   Their seafood and vegetarian tasting menus are excellent; perhaps the best way to get the full experience. You gotta get a bottle of wine with them, of course, and your server will surely be helpful here. Their fresh bread comes in various kinds and is simply wonderful. Desserts are very good, even the cannoli, which I normally do not get or like as it is fried.  Eleven is a great Sunday brunch place as well. Recently, I tried their brunch on their patio. It was as outstanding as the dinners. My brunch partner and I each got the $25 prix fixe menu, which includes an appetizer, an entree, and a cocktail. We chose the fresh oysters (yummy with their in-house spicy papaya sauce; a must try), goat cheese donuts (nice unique combination of fruit, cheese, sugar, and donut; another must try), eggs benedict with salmon substituted for ham, and the vegetarian omelet. All were excellent and the salmony eggs benedict served on the English muffin were the best I had so far in my current life.  The cocktails were also delightful: try the peachy bellini and the white sangria, which I thought was better. The whole brunch prix fixe was very filling; we had to take almost half the entrees to go.   Let me not forget to mention their fresh berry jam that came with the bread. I could have eaten only that for brunch with the fresh bread.  The servers at Eleven deserve big kudos. They are professional, friendly, and they do know the menu items well. They can make suggestions and I have so far not made a wrong choice by following their suggestions. I hope they continue to serve as an example to raise the standards of service in many of Pittsburgh eateries.    In summary, go there. While I enjoyed escaping the crowds and the solitude during their Sunday brunch, I am happy to see more people packing the place on a Sunday to enjoy and support this fine establishment. Maybe I should watch what I wish for...",

To start, reservations were simple, an online form with three questions.  I got a call same day to confirm the reservation, a nice touch.  We were promptly greeted and shown to our table.  The ambiance is sort of renovated loft meats new Victorian with a nice lighting level.    The wait staff was great.  They were witty and had personality.  They were attentive without being overbearing.  Best wait staff I have seen for a while to be honest.  The first course of the meal was a beet salad.  The course was well prepared and the beets were roasted, pureed, and etc in a very pleasing fashion.    The second course was a plate of porgies with a brown apple butter.   This was my least favorite course but was very well done as well.  The filling was well spiced and paired well with the savory sauce and the tart/sweet apples.   The entree was a plate of roasted squash, root vegetables and croquettes.  They really let the vegetables speak for themselves in this course and I stuffed myself a bit too much by this point in time.  The deserts were a well done Myer lemon pudding cake and a blood orange tart.  Both of which were a perfect balance between sweet and tart and were the perfect size.",

The place is spectacular. There is a loft feel to the place (or may be it is a redesigned loft). The wall of wines is amazing. I tasted a few things here and loved them all. Well to be honest, except the chef's compliments vanilla bean caramel. No fault of the chef or the vanilla bean or the caramel or the compliments. I don't like caramel. Too sweet.  The service is great too, as expected. Get the cheese appetizer. Well I love cheese. I love their sangria too. I can't remember if there were more than one on the menu, but  it was delish - not too fruity, not to alcohol-y, just the right balance. The desserts are to die for!!! Must must must go back! And for brunch too! Heard they are just as good as the dinners.",

The bartenders were fantastic.  Our cocktail- a spicy tequila margarita was amazing.  It was one of the most refreshing cocktails I have had in a long time.

The edamame was no longer on the menu, but it turns out the menu changes pretty frequently. I enjoyed the lamb tacos and a variety of cheeses once again; we added the tuna tartare as an appetizer and nibbled on the variety of breads they offered.  My coworker and I had a pretty heavy lunch, so we topped off the meal with a salad each. I chose the Three Sisters Farm Mesclun while my coworker opted for the Three Greens. Both were great, light, and had some nice accompaniments.   Would go back, WILL go back whenever I am in Pittsburgh!!",

Different tables scattered throughout a couple of levels, 2 different bars, good lighting, relaxed feel.  I consider Eleven a special occasion spot and I was here with a couple of friends celebrating a friends birthday.    The bread basket here is good!  Try the olive bread.    Our table started with 2 appetizers.  The lamb tacos and the grilled peaches and ham.  Not a big fan of the lamb tacos.  Difficult to share because they aren't really tacos more like a heap of meat with some cheese.  The peach and ham was delicious!    For dinner I ordered the seafood tasting menu which came with salmon, crab cake, and mahi.  Good- I ate every last bite.    The waiter was entertaining.  It seemed like he wanted to sit down and chat with us.  He may have been flirting with the birthday girl?    The best part of the meal was the banana cream pie.  I want to go back and get my very own without having to share it next time.  I'm selfish like that with my dessert!  A bit pricey here.",

Incredible atmosphere, an intriguing space with a variety of seating options beyond the normal restaurant and an interesting menu.  Why three stars? The food overall was \"eh.\" The best part of the meal was the bread...seriously - Rosemary sea salt foccaccia....exceptional. More food details: -The chef provide a white anchovies and crispy brussels sprouts taster that was really good -Lamb taco - had instant regret post order (thought smoked lamb would suck...), but it was incredible -The Seafood taster was a huge let down: Salmon with grits was lame and the sauce didn't help; Shrimp were ok but boring and the crab cake was the same as shrimp  After the entree I refused the dessert, but the pastry chef sends out a dark chocolate cashew truffle... it was ok. Eleven has an impressive wine selection - everything is paired for you on the menu if you're up for suggestions.  Last note - the service was frustrating . I had higher expectations at a place like Eleven. How long should a person sit with a dessert menu closed and a credit card out- 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15? Absurd.",

I was just there for Mother's Day and I have zero complaints. The vegetarian tasting was AMAZING. If you are a gin drinker, definitely ask for Uncle Val's. We also had a bottle of wine (Frog's Leap).",

    "text": "I like Pittsburgh.  It isn't trying to be anything else and it really doesn't care what you think.  I like the steel and the long quiet factories and warehouses of the industrial revolution which have become restaurants or quietly stand guard around the city.  I don't know who did the design for Eleven but it's a great space.  A transformed warehouse in the Strip - the space is airy and the lighting and tall windows beautiful.  The walls are a gun metal grey and high on one wall is what looks like a scrolling metal gate.  There are lots of cozy booths and overall the noise level in the dining room is good for conversation.  I was fortunate to be here in summer and all around the outside of the restaurant were the most beautiful pots - cascading foliage of green and burgundy shades.  I know they don't need to do this, but I noticed this detail.  In summer there is a nice terrace that is shielded from the street by these pots.  I love open kitchens.  This is an ingredient based restaurant that has access to the best of Pennsylvania farms. It was fun to see baskets of peaches lining the stainless steel shelves in front of the kitchen.  Of course we had the peach ice cream sandwich for dessert!  The service was great - friendly and just the right amount of checking in.  Wine list offers choice for all budgets.  We chose a Russian River Pinot Noir - Row Eleven and it was excellent.   I appreciated being served the bread of our choice instead of a basket on the table.    They offer a selection and all were great - semolina, salted foccacia, and a wheat with currants.   The menu offered great choice among tasting menus and tasting entrees.  I love this concept and so we had the Seafood Tasting entree. Everything was beautifully plated and excellent.  Perfectly done salmon atop cucumbers and potatoes, Halibut with roasted tomatoes and a crab cake among the best I've had.  I wish more restaurants would do this.  We also had an excellent salad which they offered to split.  For start we had the lamb taco and everything about this dish worked.  Every bite was heaven - pulled lamb, lentils, corn, cilantro....  I was hoping to try the Happy Hour which looked great... All around an excellent meal in a beautiful space.",

We followed with the three greens salad, fava bean salad, halibut and lamb chops.  The halibut was a spectacular dish.  The lamb was only ok -  seemed like a lot of work to eat.

We went there on Sunday after the Pens lost.  It was practically dead...maybe a little too dead.  We got drinks at the bar.  I had the mule...it was awesome.  Very good.  Talking with the bartender I mentioned that I liked Cucumber drinks, and during dinner he brought up a free cucumber Gin drink.  How awesome is that..  We went up to our table.  I got the vegetarian tasting menu w/ the wine, and the boyfriend got the meat one.  He really liked his I think.  Here's my opinion on what they served;  1st course;  Asparagaus Salad.  Good.  I've never eaten asparagus raw but all the flavors were really fresh. 2nd Course;  Fried egg w/ greens.  AWESOME!  Yum...don't know how they cooked that egg but it was perfect. 3rd Course:  Pasta w/ artichokes, tomatoes, and olives.  This was only part of the meal that I wasn't that impressed with.  It tasted very fresh and was good, but I felt like I oould have made it at home fairly easily.  It also wasn't the type of thing I normally would have ordered though.  This also wasn't what they had on the menu for the tasting which sounded better so I was kind of disappointed. 4th Course:  Blood orange tart.  Good.   I also tried the boyfriend's chocolate peanut butter desert and it was awesome.    The wine went well with everything.  I thought the red they used for the third course was a little heavy though and they should have stuck with white.    Service was great.  They also put us in the curtained upstairs booth which was nice.  This was the best dining experience I've had in Pittsburgh in a long time.  In particular the service which I find lacking a lot of places.    I'm only giving it 4 b/c I think they could have kicked it up a notch with the food a bit.",

Since I hadn't eaten at this place for several years, I agreed to go even though I was unimpressed after my last dinner visit and hefty dinner tab. When we arrived for our reservation, the three of us were seated at a large half circle table next to a large party with noisy unmanaged children.  I eventually requested another table.  We were promptly moved which I appreciated.  The waiter then came to the table and appeared to be somewhat hung over.  He took our orders including my coffee order. We were then served cold bread and spreads. Hmm...I would have expected better for a high end \"brunch.\" I then asked for a coffee refill but never got it. I later decided to order grapefruit juice but then again never got it. When the waiter finally came back to our table, he said that the food servers sometimes forget to tell him. Way to throw your coworkers under the bus. I then had to ask for more coffee again. The food was acceptable, but portions were quite small for a \"brunch.\" Our tab for three was close to $80. Doesn't seem like much has changed since my last experience there. A hefty bill for marginal service and half empty stomachs. Yowza. I don't think I'll be back again.",

We wound up seated in the bar, but it was both comfortable and spacious - lacking the pollution of both noise and idiots one might expect to find.  The food is pretty uniformly good, although with a tendency toward the overseasoned.  I pile on salt and I didn't need to salt the steak I ordered and my husband found his burger to be more than a little salty.  Docked one point for the overseasoning and for a slower than average kitchen.  This is not a cheap dinner, although one could probably economize a bit more than we did.  What it is, is pleasant, reasonably good, occasionally excellent food with astoundingly good service.",

I ordered the lobster roll and my husband ordered the burger, planning on splitting.  The lobster roll was good, won't order again though cause next time I want my own burger and not so sure my husband would give up half again.  Did splurge on dessert too - chocolate pretzel peanut butter candy (i think that's what it was called) was worth every calorie.   Typically i end up eating more of the dessert than my husband but we were fighting to see who would get the last crumbs!  Yes, not our most healthful of evening meals but so worth every taste.    Since we sat at the bar, found the bartenders friendly and very attentive without overdoing the service.  White Sangria was just right too.  All in all, a perfect evening.",

Our waiter was very professional and attentive to our requests for a quick meal.  Unfortunately most of the items were way too salty to be enjoyable.  We had a mix of items, 3 off the tavern menu and 1 main course dish.  The calamari appetizer featured decent quality squid with a light breading but all 3 of us thought they were too salty.  I ordered mussels and again the quality of the mussels seemed good but the sauce was over loaded with salt.  My husband ordered the chicken sandwich which he would have preferred with less salt but the worst offender for him were the fries.  They were way too salty to eat and most of them were left on his plate.  My daughter had the dinner halibut meal which for 34$ was fresh and seasoned with less salt but not really better than what you can cook at home with halibut from Costco.  The service however was perfect and because we were rushed for time we did not send the salty dishes back.  I guess I prefer establishments that are able to achieve outstanding taste with quality ingredients, fine herbs and a lot less salt.  Customers can always add more salt at the table if they prefer. The atmosphere is nice.  If I went back I would absolutely ask them to skip the salt!",

    "text": "This was my next best dining experience in Pittsburgh after Soba.  Dinner started with good 'ol Shrimp and Grits.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the grits, while a little soupier then I'm used to, were flavorful and savory.  This was probably a bit heavy as far as appetizers go, but heck you only live once.  My entree was a delicious Striped Sea Bass with mussels and couscous.  It was delicious and the sea bass was perfectly seared to give a nice crispness to the skin.  Bonus points go to their sommelier who made a perfect wine recommendation with a Louis Latour Pinor Noir that really highlighted the Mediterranean spices in the dish.  To satisfy my sweet tooth I capped off the meal with the Chocolate-Peanut-Pretzel Candy Bar.  The sweetness of the chocolate and peanut butter went perfectly with the saltiness of the pretzels.  All in all I had a great meal and would definitely go back if I find myself in Pittsburgh again.",

But it's one of those places that although the check stings, you never feel like you didn't get what you paid for (i.e. that $50 steak will be a giant cut of beautiful aged, grass-fed beef cooked to perfection).  So here's the trick - go for brunch.  Although you should be warned, this is a wasted Sunday kind of brunch (I am can't seem to avoid eating myself into a coma).  It is by far the best value for brunch in the city and a cheap way to get your Eleven fix.  If you have the cash, by all means go for dinner.  This is our birthday/anniversary spot.",

    "text": "I was in town for work, and my husband took me to Eleven for my birthday. What a magical evening! When we arrived, my husband asked if \"table Eleven\" was at all available, and to our delight, it was! That's the sort of private balcony overlooking the bar area. We ordered a couple of cocktails and began our food adventure.   The server was extremely attentive, as were other servers who came to check on us periodically, and the cute boy with the bread basket came over numerous times to replenish our bread. The rosemary-sea salt focaccia is to die for!  For the first course, I started with the foi gras, and my man had a dozen oysters. The foi gras was seared to perfection, and the presentation was fabulous. The balance of flavors from the little bit of fruit and glaze on the plate and the crispy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside brioche, was perfect. My husband loved the house-made hot sauce that came with the oysters. I tried it, and it's very yummy and VERY hot!   We then had the most delicious lobster bisque, which had such unique flavor (I think it was a dash of chili and some Pernod). For the main course, I had the Elysian Fields Lamb which was so beautifully medium rare and as tender as any tenderloin I've had. The polenta was excellent and perfectly seasoned, and the carrots and turnips were prepared so nicely al dente. My husband went sort of nuts over his short ribs. I tasted them and kind of went nuts too. SO good!   As if the meal couldn't get any better, we dove into the dessert menu. I told the server that I wanted the most insanely chocolate dessert they had, and she did not lead me astray with the molten lava cake. I've had many molten lava cakes, and I consider myself to be an expert on them, even having tried making them myself. This cake was downright orgasmic: perfect lava center, house made hazelnut ice cream, chocolate crispy chunks decorating the plate, and a chocolate wafer with \"happy birthday\" written on it. My husband was pretty fond of his cannoli as well. This meal was such a winner in my book. I just wish Yelp had a rating of \"Lick The Plate\" because that's what I wanted to do after each course.",

    "text": "We dined at Eleven for the first time recently and had high expectations. After all, it has fantastic Yelp reviews and a very encouraging average rating. Plus many of our friends who have lived in Pittsburgh longer than us (and whose culinary tastes we respect and are usually aligned with) said great things. Perhaps it was these high expectations that resulted in us leaving disappointed...Eleven just didn't do it for us.  Four of us had dinner on a not-too-busy evening. All of us shared the opinion that we won't be going back. Why? How can such a high-scoring mainstay of Pittsburgh's dining scene fail to impress us?  It wasn't the space, which is great. We loved the little nooks and crannies where tables are placed upstairs. It makes for a more intimate dining experience. That said, the four of us were seated at a table in an alcove that could have easily taken a group of six...needless to say we were a bit too spread out for our liking. That aside, it is a lovely space and the bar area is also really nice. I would go back for drinks at the bar.  What about the service? Service was very professional and formal without being too formal. Apparently the kitchen messed up our order and had to re-do some dishes. Our server was apologetic and the manager came to explain. We hadn't really noticed the delay so it wasn't a problem, but we appreciated this level of attention to detail. All staff were friendly and attentive. What you'd expect for a fine-dining restaurant.  Unfortunately the let down was the food. The crux of the problem here was twofold. First, the serving sizes. The portions were just too big. I guess this is great \"bang for the buck\" if you are happy boxing leftovers to take home. But it just seemed to be far too much food. Second, the seasoning. Everything was way too salty. I love my salt for sure but this was over the top. Ultimately these problems resulted in us feeling too full and uncomfortable at the end. The next morning more than one of us reported having a \"food hangover\" (not of the alcohol kind), which was a shame. As a final point with the food, I would also say that Eleven's kitchen tends to play it safe. Lots of more \"traditional\" preparations on the menu. Not much creativity and innovation (unlike Salt of the Earth or Notion). If you are familiar with the kinds of dishes Spoon (in East Liberty) puts out then you'll be familiar with what Eleven's kitchen does. None of this is bad but I think Pittsburgh deserves more innovation and excitement given some of the newer restaurants in town that are doing (relatively) amazing things.  All in all Eleven failed to deliver on the reputation it has built--at least from what we had read and heard before going there. Will we return? Probably not. There are so many great restaurants on the higher end of the scale in Pittsburgh (e.g., Notion, Salt of the Earth) that there are just better options out there.",

Wonderful soup with a hint of lemon and the fresh (a hint of licorice) kick of basil...oh and the lobster was quite  tasty.  Next was the amazing  Asparagus with soft egg, ramp vinaigrette, and just right \"squashed\" fingerling potatoes.  As I neared my limit I had the Ricotta Cavatelli which was rich and sublime.  Sadly I was getting a bit full so I took this dish home after a small sample.  Best for last (got some dining assistance here): Rosewater Pavola which was a smooth finish to a great meal,  And I am a big big fan of meringues!  The blackberries and mint ice cream (not the green stuff) had a clean, organic taste.  Just think really really fresh.  Oh and my date had the Seafood Tasting and was equally pleased.     What a wonderful dining experience!  I read lots of reviews but was really surprised by the food, and super service (Read raves for Edward and gotta give some props to his attentive service!) I love the use of local, sustainable foods too!",

To the owners of the restaurant, when you decorate with your very unique personal style, you limit the number of people who might identify with it,  much less appreciate and enjoy it. It seems that a restauranteur would want to appeal to a broad base of customers. You do that with your menu but not your decor.",

However, my main course had steamed vegetables drowning in butter... I asked for just steamed! The next plate had an ice cold crab cake on it... I sent this back and settled on a plate of fruit... Which was lovely. The manager was apologetic as was the server... I certainly will think twice about coming back as these were rookie mistakes!",

    "text": "I had been to Eleven about a year ago and loved it so much that I had decided to take my boyfriend there for his birthday. The architecture has a cool, modern hip vibe that invites you to stay and hang around for awhile. And who wouldn't if you're seated facing the kitchen business.   I love the fact that they have a stone oven in the basement so their bread is baked fresh. To top it off they have special bread peeps who have a nice array and some butter to accompany however while very tempting try to resist on having too many so that you can enjoy the rest of your meal.  The last time I was at Eleven I had an entree but this time we both decided to go big and do the tasting with the wine pairings (ouchie on my wallet). Everything was going so well. The wine and food were delicious and the serving sizes weren't too big and I was able to finish all four portions though went into a food coma immediately after.   I do recommend the tasting - perhaps to treat yourself or someone else, maybe for a special event however one thing does bother me about our service. There was already a dessert included with our tasting and before this course our waiter hands us the dessert menu and says that since we both were going to get the same thing we could try something else which we thought was a great idea. Neither of us ended up getting the tasting dessert and getting two on the menu - one was a flourless chocolate cake and the other a creme brulee. Great way to end the meal until I got our bill and there was an extra dollar for each of the desserts tacked on. I probably wouldn't be so sour if our waiter had mentioned this to us when handing over the dessert menus.",

    "text": "I went to Eleven on Monday night for a business dinner, and had a fabulous time. The food was outstanding, the service was great, and the atmosphere was unique and very homey.   We all started off with some wine (the list was nothing special but had some good choices... I had the Shiraz, which I really enjoyed) and appetizers. Between 6 of us, we shared the lamb tacos (unbelievable!), the sashimi (REALLY small - not much of an appetizer unless it is for one person) and the crab cakes (I've had better, but they were tasty and sizable). They came by with a bread basket with three different types of bread, and came back to offer us more bread about 3 times. The breads were all delicious as well.   For my main course, I had the pork chop. Ah-ma-zing. One of my fellow diners asked the waitress's recommendation between the salmon and the pork, and wow was she right that you can't go wrong with the pork. It was so tender and flavorful, with roasted vegetables and a delicious glaze. I am salivating just thinking about it again right now.   And the desserts.... we were full but we couldn't say no. You may not think the cannoli sound like anything special, but they really knocked our socks off. We also tried the pretzel/chocolate/ice cream whatever-it's-called, which was delicious too. But I think everyone was more surprised that the cannoli were so delicious that they were the hit of the night.   I do have two complaints about Eleven. One is that it is pricey. As long as you know this going in, it's not really a problem. Obviously going for a business dinner, it was okay, and it would also be fine for a special occasion. But it's definitely not your everyday dinner location.   The second is the lighting. We had to ask our waitress for a flashlight/pull out our smartphones to read the menus. While the ambiance was nice, we could've used a little more light so we could at least read the menus.  Overall, I definitely recommend Eleven for an elegant and delicious dinner in downtown Pittsburgh. I would definitely go back if I ever find myself back in town!",

    "text": "Is it possible to get a fine dining experience in Pittsburgh?  Before eating at Eleven, I would have said \"No\".  However, this gem of an eatery has opened my eyes to the possibility of top notch food in the Steel City.  The restaurant itself is expansive, with high ceilings, wood beams and exposed brick.  The service, while efficient, seemed somewhat standoffish and cold.  We started with the spicy tuna tartare, which had an excellent texture and just the right amount of heat.  Not to belabor the point, but it was more than a little surprising to experience high quality tuna tartare in Pittsburgh.  Given that it was a whole 12 degrees outside that evening, a nice soup seemed a good option.  The roasted squash soup was well made and had a nice roasted flavor to go with the velvety texture.  The entree selections were slanted toward meat and fowl.  I opted for the NY strip steak.  It came out perfectly cooked and served sliced atop potato-goat cheese pierogis and simply prepared sauteed spinach.  It was clear after the first bite, that the cow this steak had come from was grass raised.  This was a clear example of quality ingredients, prepared with restraint, yielding truly satisfying results.  Dessert was the peanut butter banana split, consisting of an uneven combination of peanut butter ice cream, marshmallow, graham cracker roasted banana ice cream, vanilla bean soup and chocolate.  There was just a little too much going on here.  Eleven is definitely an excellent dining experience, regardless of location, and I will be going back next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

Highly recommend both, but boy liked mine more :). For dessert we split the lava cake and it was by far the best lava cake ever.

    "text": "My fellow supervisors and I came here for a pre-Christmas lunch.  It was kind of our way of self-congratulating ourselves while our minions dined on McDon.... I mean we decided to have a nice social outing with a very fine lunch.    Anyway, the food here is to die for and it's certainly someplace you don't dine at every day.  I mean, when they describe their grilled cheese sandwich as \"Arsenal cheese curds, grass fed local white cheddar, parmesan, and onion jam\" you know you're not dealing with the Kraft American between two slices of egg-dipped toast that you get at Eat-n-Park.  Even the burgers are made of braised veal.  O but this place is far from pretentious as they can certainly back it up with the quality of food and service.  I went for the Maine lobster salad with mesclun greens and believe you me, I don't order lobster very often but this was heavenly.  And for dessert, my boss and I split the chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar.  See, that's the great thing about sharing a dessert.  I had just enough room in my tummy for a little something to fill in the cracks between the parts of my main meal.  And since I'm a type-1 diabetic, splitting a dessert means I only have to take half the insulin to cover it.  So give me a small \"Pump that insulin, Susan.  Pump!\" here.    And just what is a  chocolate-peanut-pretzel-candy bar?  I'll give you a hint--it's definitely no Snicker's bar.  It's a brownie with peanut brittle, and milk chocolate and peanut butter ice cream  So anyway, we had a great holiday lunch here with fantastic food and amazing service.  If you work Downtown, you owe it to yourself to have at least one fine meal here.",

    "text": "Been eating out lots and lots and lots lately.   I have had such good luck with Yelp, but have had more than one less than positive experiences in the past few weeks with highly, highly recommended restaurants.  I hate to give a negative review, but if I had read anything close to what we experienced, I would not have spent a lot (a lot) of money at Eleven.  I am originally from Pittsburgh and now live outside DC.  My husband and 2 sons (age 19 and 16) Went to Eleven solely based on Yelp reviews on a recent visit to Pittsburgh when we were able to take some time away from family events.  I love the Strip, so we  headed to Eleven which, Yelpers, sounded great  - people talked about cozy booths and wooden beams, etc... I was, therefore,  unprepared for the dark, stark, industrial nature of the place.  Yes, it is in keeping with the city and the vibe of the Strip, but I found the whole place to be loud, cold and impersonal.  Opposite of cozy.      The worst thing really was the odor that hit us as we entered.  Kind of a whiff of wet garbage, maybe?  All 4 of us smelled it immediately, and it was not inviting.  The hostess looked at us like we were crazy.  We had a drink in the bar. (There are TV's.  Why?  ISn't this a classy place?)  Smell was in the bar, and in the restaurant but fainter.  Honestly, I don't even remember the specifics of the food.  A lot of it was tasty, for sure. All of it was overpriced for Pittsburgh.  I've been in so many similar restaurants in major cities, I guess Pittsburgh is just catching up.  Maybe I don't like seeing the generic pretentious foodiness in a city that is famous for fries on sandwiches?  That's my problem, for sure.  It was expensive, by any measure.  I was actually angry I spent so much on an experience that would have been considered highly average where ever it was.  Is this a chain?  I would give it 2.5 stars.",

    "text": "I'm in Pittsburgh for work, not pleasure, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try to make the most of my time here -- that's for sure!  From the moment I hopped in my cab at the airport I was asking about the local fare...what to have? what to avoid? can I walk around by myself at night without getting jumped?...the usual.  Seriously, though.  I knew getting a Philly cheese steak sandwich would be sacrilegious (even mentioning it here stirs up some intense Penn city rivalry), so that narrowed the options to something a bit fancier than a deli for my dinners.    Eleven came highly recommended by both Yelp and by the tourist service tent at the convention center.  I just finished my meal there about an hour ago and Yelp had gotten me pretty amped to check this place out in the first place.  Plus, eleven is my favorite number.   Maybe I over-hyped to myself, because I was a bit underwhelmed.  I'm going to give it a four based on the ambiance, the fact that they checked my coat for me, and the service (I sat in the lounge area to the left) was excellent.  I had two waiters to myself who kept peer pressuring me to get more drinks which was much appreciated by the beer-lover in me.  Atmosphere aside, though, I think the food could have been better.    Apps and drinks- Dog Fish Head brewery couldn't make a bad beer if they tried.  It's won a ton of awards and this time round I had the \"Aprihop\" IPA.  IPA lover or not, all beer drinkers (guzzlers?) will like this, as the bitter taste is well balanced by a really subtle sweetness.  Not a \"girly\" beer, though, so don't be fooled.  Paired with this I had the appetizer sea scallops (with fingerling potato, pearl onion, pancetta, sauce gribiche [mmm], and arugula).  The arugula (tender-wilted) and potatoes were cooked just right, but the scallops were more fishy than they were sweet and melt-in-your-mouth.  I appreciated the concept of it all, but considering it was the waiter's no. 1 recommendation, I think it fell short.  Also a bit pricey, but I knew what I was getting myself into.  Main course- I had previously read about the \"Jamison Farm Lamb\" at Eleven, plus locals had told me that lamb was great out here, so that's what I did.  It was a complex dish with a lot of textures and ideas: Anson Mills polenta, fava beans, shitake mushrooms, grapes, garlic confit, olive jus.  The warm and tender grapes paired with the lamb (cooked medium for me) was a really great idea -- I've never had anything like it.  The roasted garlic confit was also really tasty and a smart addition.  The olives, though? Not a jus, but rather cooked kalamata halves.  They were harsh and over-powered the rest of the dish.  Plus, the lamb steak (which comes sliced nicely) was very meager for the high price.  The bed of polenta and the shitakes were good, but I expected that to be done correctly.  I just think the food didn't \"WOW\" me like I expected.    And for these reasons plus the higher-than-needed prices and too-dark eating area, Eleven could have been a \"5\" with its high level of swank and class.  I ended up experiencing a \"4\" (more like a \"3.8\" but who's counting).    Overall: check this place out for sure, just steer in a different direction than I did when making food choices.  Bottoms up, my friends!",

Sweet and light, perfect for the boat-load of calories I was about to consume. I tried to keep the appetizer on the healthy side with a beet salad. With apple butter and goat cheese lightly fried, it was refreshing and delicious! I can't stay away from the mushroom, zucchini omelette with fingerling potatoes and bacon. They must have the best bacon in Pittsburgh. It must have a dry rub and its cut thick and really crispy.

The peaches were in season so they were sweet and the lamb taco was flavorful.  Not usually a fan of lamb, but didn't mind this appetizer at all.  I got the seafood platter as the entree which consisted of the halibut, salmon, and a crab cake.  All were cooked perfectly - not undercooked or overdone.  I think my favorite was the crab cake.  The fish were cooked well but didn't have a distinct flavor at least with the seasoning.  Salmon always has a distinct taste, but I wanted the seasoning to complement it and I think this was missing for both the salmon and the halibut.    For dessert we had the blueberry cannoli and the banana cream pie - I think these are the right names, but you'll be able to tell which ones I'm talking about if they still have them on the menu.  The banana cream pie was not what I expected - it was more of a deconstructed pie, but very tasty.  The banana flavor was subtle and not too overwhelming.  The blueberry cannoli was also very subtle and delish.  Highly recommend this place!  While it may not be somewhere I can go too often b/c it's a bit pricey to make it a routine dinner spot, it's definitely something I'll think about on those special treat type of nights.",

The Tuna Tartare we had came with a Yuzu Mignonette (tart, lemony) and White Anchovy (briny, uber-fishy in a good way), both great accompaniments to the mild, creamy-feeling minced tuna back meat (akami).  The Pumpkin Cavatelli was light on the pumpkin flavor (maybe a hit of fall spices), but served in a light stock-based sauce with Roasted Cipolinis and Smoked Duck Ham (spicing almost like pastrami or pickle brine), was an umami flavor symphony, subtle but addictive.  Cocktails were well-made, I got a Ruby Red with fresh grapefruit juice.  You'll need some adult bucks to come here, but once you make it a few rungs up, you should come on over.",

I am especially fond of the cucumber mule (OMG!) cocktail.   When we have been here for dinner it has been consistently good, with great service. I have heard that holidays like New Years are to be skipped, but I know that's the case at almost any restaurant anywhere.   I am now craving oysters, so I may have to go back this week :-)",

They confused the doneness we requested for our steaks, but other than that, our meals were delicious. My highlight was the pumpkin puree soup. So. Good. It had the right amount of toasted pepitos to add a lovely texture to each bite. My husband had a beet abs apple salad that was out of this world. I mean, who knew beets could be THAT delicious!?  I had the hanger steak with roasted cauliflower and rosemary potato pancake. The cauliflower was a tad underwhelming, but the carmelized shallots that accompanied it rocked my world.   The desserts?  Hell yes.  Banana cream pie and apple pie?  Done and done.    Overall great experience.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, that I love restaurants that have a quiet ambiance and wonderful wait staff.  Luxury really appeals to me and I feel like Eleven restaurant feels like a luxurious little box of sophistication.  It may not look like that from the outside, but I dig the vibe inside of that restaurant.  For my recent birthday, I decided to treat myself to a lovely lunch to celebrate one more year of life on this planet.  I have previously enjoyed their burgers (In my humble opinion, one of the best burgers in the tri-state area, New York and New Jersey!  Later on that...), their Roasted Chicken entree and their Hangar Steak and Fries.  To me, preparing a well roasted chicken with a flavorful and crispy outside and juicy inside seems like basic cooking 101.  Au contraire!  Anyone who cooks will tell you that achieving a crispy skin and juicy inside is difficult.  How many rubber skinned chickens have we all eaten at banquets, Aunt Susie's, your house, your mom's house???  You get my point.  Anywho, all of those meals were just kid's stuff compared to my birthday lunch.  What did I have, may one ask?  Indeed you may ask and I will tell you that I had an absolutely superb lunch of their Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  Instead of ordering the crab cakes as an appetizer, I asked my lovely waiter if I could be served two (yes, two) crab cakes as an entree with an additional vegetable.  He was able to accommodate my request and out came some of the most marvelous crab cakes that I have ever eaten.  (I am crab cake snob.  I don't want no stinking fillers that I can discern within my crab cakes.  I don't want no stinking vegetables in my crab cakes.  If you use \"artificial\" crab meat in my crab cakes, I might just kill you or hurt you real bad!)   I have only had one other crab cake in my life that rivaled this crab cake. (Tasted in Baltimore, MD at a crab festival and I wanted to marry the maker of said crab cakes.)  The crab cakes were heavenly, the fingerling potatoes were wonderfully dressed with a bright lemon based sauce and the sauteed green beans were full of flavor and not overly cooked.  The crab cakes were crab-tabulous!   I can say no more about the foodgasm that I experienced.  About Eleven's burgers.  Can you say braised veal, bacon, crispy onions and cheese of your choice on a ultimate burger patty without drooling?  Enough said!",

I love the upscale feeling, but you can also go in not super dressed up (at least for lunch) too.  At lunch time on MLK, the place was pretty quiet, but I'd imagine you need a reservation at dinner time.  The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was very friendly, especially for a more upscale place.  The actual food isn't particularily creative, but it's delicious.  Everything is fresh and hot, and I really enjoyed the entire experience.  I ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich ($14).  It was a substantial size, and it tasted amazing.  My friend ordered the Eleven Burger, and it looked equally amazing.  Our waiter was telling us that when he comes into work, it's always some new cooking adventure in the kitchen, and he is always excited to try the food.  How many servers and people in the restaurant industry can say they'll eat where they work?  I won't eat where I work!  If that isn't enough proof enough that Eleven is amazing, I don't know what is.  We wanted dessert, but we could not make up our minds.  So our waiter said he would suprise us.  All desserts, at least at lunch, are $10.  They are also all meant to be split, which our waiter was kind enough to share with us.  He surprised us with two ice cream sandwiches- homemade pumpkin ice cream between two ginger snap cookies.  I'm salivating just THINKING about them.  AMAZING.  Highlight of the meal.  I loved Eleven, and it's definitely some of the best dining in PIttsburgh!  Check it out.",

    "text": "I feel at this point that review number 288 for Eleven is the reviewing equivalent of throwing a hot dog down a hallway, but I might as well throw my hot dog, er, hat into the ring.  Located at the lower end of The Strip, my girlfriend and I had Eleven in our sights for a late bite to eat after seeing the Andy Warhol museum across the river. I was impressed to see the valet service out front, and it is probably my first visit to a pure restaurant that had that, mind you we walked here. The interior was gorgeous, with wooden beams running across the high ceiling, and a mix of cozy rounded booths and tables in the main restaurant area. A huge display of wine bottle towered above the entrance and iron work decorated the walls. I was surprised to see TVs over in the lounge area of a place this high end, but I think it just speaks to the sports madness of Pittsburgh.   As it was my girlfriend's appetite that primarily brought us here (I was still fairly full after some pre-museum street food), I just chose to get a couple appetizers instead of a main, going with the beet salad with duck ham to start and then a pork terrine plate.  The salad came very quickly. The duck \"ham\" was delicious; the mild flavoured duck paired well with the maple cure that it received and which also gave it a ham-esque taste as well. The cornbread croutons added just a hint of corn flavour and sweetness, as well as a nice crunch to the dish. The smooth Humboldt Fog cheese complemented all of the other ingredients with its richness and a hint of sweetness, while the molasses vinaigrette tied it all together with just a bit of tartness to cut through all of the other rich flavours and balanced it out.   The pork terrine was like a personal-sized charcuterie plate, with a few slices of the terrine, pickles, baguette slices and pickled eggs. The pickled eggs were cooked perfectly, with no overcooked green-grey areas around the yolk, and a pleasing tartness to them. The bread and butter pickles were a good choice as I feel like dills would have made the plate as a whole too lip puckering. The terrine itself was delicious, similar to a mortadella, but much, much better; its smoother, less compacted texture and little bits of veggies mixed in were winners.   Service was attentive and friendly over the course of the meal.  If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I'd love to come back, although this time I might pull up to the place in style.",

Scallops: mouth-watering deliciousness that you shouldn't miss out on 3. Swordfish: Must order.   We skipped dessert, but somehow found room for complimentary macarons. And oh, so glad we did.

    "text": "How have I not reviewed this place before?  It is always in my list of the top 5 restaurants in the burgh whenever I am asked and I was pretty certain that I had.  From that you can probably gather that I come here a decent amount with the most recent time being on a Wednesday afternoon with my father for lunch.  We had made lunch reservations for 12:30 and arrived some time around there and were seated immediately.  Upon entering the restaurant it was easy to see that we didn't need the reservations but I would rather be safe than sorry.  The inside of Eleven is pretty cool and very open as it has been built inside of an old warehouse.  It is two stories tall with dining on both floors but with an open plan where you can see the ceiling pretty whenever you dine at.  There is a lovely fireplace whenever you first walk into the restaurant and to the left is the bar and the right the main dining room.  The bar is a pretty nice place and I have seen them open it up in the summer where there garage doors of the warehouse used to be.  On this occasion we sat at a small two top in the main dining room where at the end you can see into the pastry kitchen.  They is also a large two story wine cellar near the entrance which is cool to look at.  Since it had been awhile since I had been to Eleven for lunch I decided to order the Eleven Burger as my entree with blue cheese as my cheese of choice.  Before our lunch was served the waiter brought out the bread basket.  Inside was one of my favorite premeal breads, a salted foccacia which pairs perfectly with the butter that they have there.  There was also some rustic Italian bread which was good as well.  Whenever the burger came to table I was reminded of why it is my favorite burger in Pittsburgh.  It is piled pretty high with all of the goodies inside of it and I have to cut it in half just to be able to eat it.  The burger has braised veal on the bottom, meat in the middle and then is topped with the cheese that you choose, bacon and some crispy onions. This last time that I visited the burger was as good as every other time I have had it with the burger being cooked perfectly and the bun slightly toasted.  It also comes with some seasoned fries that I always enjoy as well.  My dad ended up going with the Flank Steak for his lunch entree which also came with some fries.  He told me that the ends of his steak were a bit chewy but the middle was awesome.  I guess that is what you get whenever they oversear a tougher cut of meat.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  Eleven is one of the most consistent and best restaurants in Pittsburgh and I am not sure that I have ever had a bad meal here.",

The reason I gave Eleven 3 stars is to the actual food. We ordered beignets and the grilled sticky. When I see that beignets or donuts come with a [Meyer lemon] curd, I expect the curd to be inside, but these beignets had the curd just on the plate. They were good beignets but if they had filling I would have enjoyed them more. The grilled sticky was also good, but nothing special. The grilled sticky is the result of combining a cinnamon roll + texas toast in one. I though it was a bit too sweet, but quite crispy. I feel like I could've gotten the grilled sticky anywhere.   I also ordered a main dish of Eggs Benedict. The citrus salad that came with it was measly and super sour, so I was not a fan of that. The poached eggs were overdone, the hollaindaise was bland, and the English muffin was too toasted. I wish I ordered something else because I was not impressed by the Eggs Benedict at all.   I heard that dinner is much better, and I think i would go back to try it, yet I wouldn't get my hopes up.",

Most recently, a friend and I stopped in for happy hour after work and enjoyed some Eleven Mules and oysters on the half shell. I had the salmon special and the roasted cauliflower was AMAZING (especially for cauliflower, of all things). My friend got the Eleven Burger with goat cheese as usual; she can't get past that on the menu because it's so good. If you're looking for a nice place where you can be sure the dinner will stand out, Eleven is the place to go.",

Recently went to a birthday and had beef tenderloin. It was way bigger than I expected and it was amazing. Also had beet salad, which was good but had it before and it was better last time with the lettuce and goat cheese. This time had like a coleslaw Apple concoction underneath that wasn't very tasty. The three greens salad is very good.   It is pricy, but it's worth it.  Their happy hour special from 4-6 is okay- could offer a bit more specials or half off drafts, which they do not offer.   Desserts are very good and always changing.",

    "text": "I'm a solid 4.5 here (Yelp, I need half stars, I just do)- our experience at Eleven was fantastic.   We braved the snow and rain and made our way to Eleven to enjoy a quiet meal before heading over to the Benedum to see Hamilton.  Our coats were whisked off our shoulders and we were immediately shown to our seats.    Our waitress, Katherine (I think...) was attentive and very personable.  Her and her teammates made sure our water glasses were never empty and our wine glasses were equally full.  In fact, we decided to split a glass of wine since we still had to head to the show, and she served it in two glasses - great service!  She also asked if we were headed to Hamilton and made sure to get us out the door in plenty of time.   The wine list was great -- I was impressed to see a few of our favorite bottles available, we didn't get a bottle, but if we didn't have other plans we likely would have.    The food was equally impressive.  Our appetizers were tuna tartar, which was minced versus diced and I didn't think I'd favor it, but I did.  It was like someone laid out my favorite sushi filling for me to snack on with some chips.  Only negative?  You need more of the wafer/cracker/chips to finish off the delicious tuna!  We also had the fig and ricotta salad.  It was good, but I didn't catch the smoked flavor described.   Our entrees were well-loved by both of us - I had the halibut and my husband the lamb loin.  They were seasoned to the t - we each ate as much as we could!!  The halibut was unique in that it came with red peas.  I didn't love them but I didn't hate them - they had to be in the right bite to make sense.  The rest of the accompaniments were well-paired with the fish and the entire dish was composed well.  The lamb was beautifully presented and each bite was as good as the last.  I loved the polenta cubes!    I don't think there is much more that I can say other than go here.  Just do it.  It's worth it.",

Parking: valet, the lot across the street (price can range depending on if there are events or not) garage on the block behind is a flat $6 on weekends  Tip: sign up for the big burrito group mailings to get a packet of coupons in the winter AND to get one for $30 off an entree on your birthday!    Reservations: highly recommended. Use opentable and earn points towards dining certificates   Brunch is a prix fixe menu with a cocktail or juice, starter and entree. I had an insanely delicious and spicy Bloody Mary to sip/chug during my meal. A complementary basket of mini muffins and croissants was brought out with some hibiscus jam and apple cinnamon butter.  For the starter, I went with the deconstructed salmon everything bagel. Scallion cream cheese, diced egg, red onion and capers were available to smear on a perfectly toasted everything bagel. I had the prosciutto onion and cheddar omelette with fingerling potatoes and a side of bacon for my entree. The potatoes and bacon were crispy and perfect! The omelette didn't have as much prosciutto as I would like but it was so flavorful and filling!  Head to the bar for some post brunch cockstails and ask for Brian!  Update:  Finally got down here for dinner:  HH: 4-6 $7 drinks and bar snacks   We shared the calamari that has this spicy sauce and the crispy fingerling potatoes with cheese curds. Both were fried to perfection, not over done at all. The calamari wasn't chewy at all and the cheese curds were gooey. And holy moly that garlic aioli!  I had the mushroom and onion soup as well. It came with a pea pesto that was out of this world. I shamelessly licked the bowl clean using a piece of the house made focaccia bread. My entree was the medium cooked hanger steak topped with flaked sea salt. It came with a potato croquette and some roasted cauliflower. Had to get dessert of course so I went with the dark chocolate cake!",

    "text": "We spent all afternoon drinking beer and then attended the Steelers/Pats game at 4:30 during which we drank more. So I didn't have any, let alone high, expectations for Eleven. As long as I didn't wretch all over the place from an errant smell (warm mayonnaise, ugh), I was going to score this place high.   We'd walked by the establishment several times as our hotel was located adjacent to it. It's a lovely building with romantic ambiance. The front door escaped us our first try (yes, I know I said we'd walked by it several times, clearly we weren't paying attention), but we eventually backtracked and found it. Again, to our credit, it was near 8pm, dark and gloomy outside. Unlike the night before at Union Station, the host took one look at us and deemed us worthy only for the bar area before we could even request a table. We were neither dirty, smelly nor excessively inebriated. I may be small but a bucket of Bud Lights isn't enough to take me over the Edge of Impropriety. He simply judged us by our layered outwear and decided for us that we would not be sitting in the dining area. Thanks for that.  Thankfully, the bartender was a very polite lady who was more than happy that we found seats at her bar. We ordered drinks and the calamari to start. Both were served quite quickly and we were left alone to enjoy our libations and watch more football while sharing the appetizer. I wasn't expecting a spicy sauce. It was very tasty but oh boy did it have an after burn that lingered on the tongue. It was one of those heats that was pleasantly tasty so you keep dipping into it until all of a sudden your tongue is aflame. I recommend this dish but only to those who don't require a side of antacid.   For our main dishes, I asked for the Crab Linguini. It has a citrus hint to it and luscious light cream sauce. But it was a rich dish that necessitated a take-home bag for half. (note: I ate the other half cold the day after and it was still possibly even more delicious than when warm.) My best guy ordered the Strip Steak. It was fired a beautiful pinkish color and served with a generous pour of jus that he said was divine (my word, not his. I think his word was \"mmmmmm\")   After a long day, we opted out of dessert and chose an early bedtime instead. We snagged our to-go bag from the abandoned host stand and enjoyed a very short walk to our hotel. In the end, we were happy we chose to dine at Eleven. The food was yummy, the bar was cozy and, if not for the host, it would have been a perfect end to a fun day in Pittsburgh.",

I found this on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try because of the great reviews. We arrived about 30 minutes before closing. The host was hesitant to seat us in the finding room but eventually did so. The interior of the restaurant was beautiful. Lovely decor. The menu had a nice variety. I chose the hanger steak and my partner chose the roasted chicken. Both dishes were superb. The chicken was sealed to perfection-- this was nice and crispy while the meat was succulent and satisfying. The risotto paired perfectly with it. The steak was flavorful and cooked perfectly. We tried the red sangria which was delicious and not overly sweet. Our server, Jon E. was probably ready to leave for the night but still have impeccable service and didn't make us feel rushed. Thanks for a great dining experience to redeem our view of the Pittsburgh culinary scene!",

You can taste the rich flavors of the heirloom tomatoes with alaskan halibut, the juicy and sweet plum and peaches in a salad with duck breast.  The lamb loins melt in your mouth as they are just so tender and properly seared.    The only thing I would suggest is to go lighter on the sauce.  Cut down the salt and cream especially so you can taste the real food taste.",

To start off our meal, we ordered three different kinds of cheeses off the build-your-own cheese board. The cheese was definitely \"smelly\", so if you are a fan of very cheesy cheeses, then you are in for a treat! Then, we split the tuna tartare for our first course. I can truly say it was the best tuna tartare i've ever had, and I'm a huge seafood fanatic. The fat of the tuna paired perfectly with the smokiness of the sauces along with the texture from the added pretzel chips. For our main course, I had the Halibut, and my date had the Chicken Risotto. Both superb. We finished off our dinner with the deconstructed Banana Cream Pie, and we were not disappointed. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and accommodating. I particularly enjoyed the servers walking around with servings of bread and butter, rather than being given a tempting full basket of bread to fill your appetite before your meal. This is a perfect location for a date night or special occasion. Overall, I highly recommend eleven, and will certainly be returning in the future.",

    "text": "Went here with a client for dinner.  We opted to do the spring tasting menu.  It did not disappoint.  It was the first day of spring with the snow coming down but that menu was a bright spot.   First course - Spring vegetables / Peas, , radish, pickled cipollini, marinated burrata, Prosciutto, pea tendril puree, sea salt focaccia, parmesan, Meyer lemon & pink peppercorn vinaigrette.  So fresh and bright, it was my favorite dish of the menu.   Second course - Ricotta cavatelli /  fava bean, pistachio, mint, rabbit sausage, goat cheese.  This was ON POINT!     Third course - Sea scallops / carrot puree, roasted carrots, black barley, Aleppo pepper oil, crispy caper.  Great texture and flavor but I do not enjoy scallops.   Fourth course - Elysian Fields Farm Lamb /white asparagus, english peas, morel mushrooms, spring onion, salsa Verde, crispy garlic.  There was a heavy hand on the salt on this dish, but that is the only complaint.   Dessert - Strawberry Shortcake.  My client loved this!  For me, it was too sweet but this is not a dessert that i would order if I was given a choice.  I would roll with my client's reaction on this one.    Overall, an excellent spot.  Gorgeous interior. great cocktails offerings, and wine list, including wines by the glass.  The Tempranillo was delicious!    Would come back in a heartbeat.  Thank you for the hospitality.",

Great for couples and adults celebrations  However, Based on my experience on Monday lunch time, I made a reservation for my 40 birthday. Very disappointed .  It was on Sunday, I did the reservations two weeks before. I waited for my table 20 minutes. And then, I waited for my smoke salmon, a bagel, cream cheese- 15$ - and lettuce salad -plus 15$ ,  45 minutes ( don't have lunch service on Sunday). They can't manage big crowd and keep the services, and believe me you're paying for at least a good service. I don't think I'm going to come back again",

The food was delicious I got the Ricotta Cavatelli it was so rich and creamy. I also got the 3 greens salad which was fresh and crispy - i wasn't a fan of the orange goat cheese on the bottom of the salad. i would have preferred a crumbly cheese not a thick consistency similar  to mayo on the bottom of a salad. The only reason why i knocked off a star was because i found the food unremarkable. I really enjoyed everything i got but nothing was like wow i need to come here again. I did think the ambience was super chic and good for a business dinner but no so much a ranting and raving about food place that i need to add to my repertoire of favorites.",

Come hungry or don't come at all, because the \"appetizer\" itself is like a normal sized brunch entree at other establishments. They also give you a free, really really amazing basket of fresh baked goodies- still thinking about the scones.   Highly recommend the smoked salmon and oysters for the appetizer, and the steak and eggs (very generous portion, steak cooked well, and loved the \"fried\" egg- almost a Scottish egg) for entree.  Reservations were easy to make for a larger party of five on opentable. The vibe here is sophisticated but not stuffy. Love the spacious circular booths and very high ceilings. Without a doubt, I'd come back here for brunch next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

Not only were we graced with the presence of Ben Roethlisberger (see: Pittsburgh Steelers) sitting around the corner from us, but Taylor Lautner (see:  Twilight) joined him soon after.  We had a pretty good time gawking at them until Lautner's body guard accused us of trying to take pictures of him (as if!) and they closed the curtain on the private room.  Anyway!  This place is desperately trying to be NYC style, and doing a pretty good job of it.  The decor is schnazzy and the big booths are cozy for a group.  The service was wonderful.. very attentive and accomodating.  The menu was sprinkled with the names of farms where the produce and meat come from.  The food was pretty good, but nothing memorable.  And the prices were definitely NYC - entrees anywhere from $23 to $55.  For Pittsburgh, this place deserves four stars.  Don't get me wrong, I love PIttsburgh, but it's just not really a haven for fancy food (see: Primanti Brothers).  I'd recommend it for a nice night out on the town.  Who knows, you may be even sitting next to Roethlisberger himself...",

The atmosphere was very sophisticated/modern and there is ample space between tables to feel that your meal is private and you are not crammed against someone else. They brought out fresh bread which was delicious. My partner and I shared the seafood tasting and gnocchi dishes, but which were a decent portion and absolutely delicious. All the seafood was cooked perfectly. For dessert I selected an in season sorbet, which was served with fresh berries and cookies. The sorbet had outstanding strong flavor and was an excellent option for a lighter, but flavorful dessert. The menu is a bit pricey, but seemed comparable to other nice restaurants with similar quality of food. This would be an excellent place for both social and business meals and we will definitely return.",

For my husband's and my appetizers, the waiters brought out tuna tartare rather than the steak tartare that we had ordered, and the lobster risotto had a 1.5-inch piece of shell in it. One waiter looked nervous and acted as if he were working his first-ever shift. He was teamed with another waiter who looked more experienced and apologized for the incorrect appetizer. For my main entree, I ordered the seafood tasting. Its salmon filet was a decent size. The crab cake had much meat in it but was a bit spicy and dry. My one scallop was tasty. I liked the baby kale. I was not a fan of the trumpet royale mushrooms, which were hard to cut and chew. My husband's strip steak was cooked the way that he wanted. Its accompanying parmesan tots were high-quality tater tots. For dessert we enjoyed an upside-down pineapple cake. Based on the two appetizers that were messed up, the entrees that tasted good but did not blow us away, and the waiters' awkward service, I am unsure if I will return again soon.",

    "text": "Eleven is a fine upscale restaurant with a lively, engaging atmosphere, adventurous and interesting dishes, and a large selection of wine, beer, and cocktails.  My wife and I were visiting from Cincinnati, and enjoy an upscale restaurant now and then. Reading the reviews on Eleven drew us to it. We were surprised and delighted when we were able to get a 7:30 reservation for Saturday night that very afternoon. I appreciated that we could reserve through Open Table right on the Yelp app. Very easy. We arrived about 30 minutes early, ready to get a cocktail, but they were able to seat us immediately. Once we walked in, it was clear why we were so readily able to get seating: this is a large restaurant! For this type of restaurant, I am used to smaller, more crowded rooms. This appears to be in a converted factory or warehouse, and the large main room with high cielings, exposed rafters, and contemporary decor and furnishings was fun and comfortable. The wine storage room hovers above, encased in glass, calling to you to try its selections.  We were seated next to an open kitchen, which was boistrous but not noisy. The guest is brought into the open kitchen experience on purpose - this was not bad seating. We rather enjoyed seeing the action and feeling the bustle.  The service was competent but did not rise to the level of the food. We were not ready to order cocktails when our server first visited (my wife was not sure she was ready to try a cocktail with frothed egg white). After a second quick check, we decided on our cocktail order, but the server did not return for about ten minutes. Once we ordered the cocktail and some oysters, we were given only a few minutes before we were asked for our orders. I was expecting some explanation of featured dishes or recommendations, but our server got straight to business - maybe that's just how it's done at Eleven, or how it's done in Pittsburgh, but the pace was a little fast for the evening-long experience we were prepared for. We decided on the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. The dishes were brought out at a somewhat irregular pace, but all were served at the appropriate temperature, and all of the service was absolutely courteous. There is the matter of the bread service - at unpredictable intervals, a woman came by to offer us bread. Once, after our appetizers (about 20 minutes after we were seated), again about 10 minutes later, and again when we had our dessert. Good bread, but a strange serving style.  We chose a plate of four oysters to start, two for each. Two were of average size, and two were unexpectedly small. They were excellent with the hot sauce.  The Chef's tasting menu was excellent - tuna tartare, grilled swordfish with couscous, sun-dried tomatoes, and pickled jalepano slices, lamb, and a fantastic selection of desserts. Despite the dessert listed with the tasting menu, we were presented with the opportunity to select any of the desserts, and our wine would be paired appropriately. The paired wine selections were very well chosen. These were wines I would have never chosen on my own, but the pairing with the dishes made them a unique experience. Mind that the paired wine selections were half-size pours. This is entirely appropriate for pairings with a multiple course meal, but don't expect to get four glasses of wine.  In conclusion, a fine atmosphere, outstanding food, and competent service. Considering the overall experience, Eleven does not entirely justify the prices it charges, but it's close. For the price, I would expect a higher class of service, atmosphere, or more adventurous dishes. It is absolutely worth a visit.",

    "text": "I was so excited to go back to Eleven. I was there last fall for a business lunch and it was amazing, I couldn't wait to try dinner. Now that dinner is over, I am feeling a little let down. For the price you pay, I expected better. It was a bunch of little issues. My husband's fork was dirty, their was sediment in his wine, the tables were a little cramped. The food was good, just good. When you are paying $36 and $42 for your entrees you kind of expect them to be amazing. I had the Seafood Tasting. It consisted of what was probably a 3 ounce crab cake, a 3 ounce piece of salmon, one tiny scallop and a couple of sliced trumpet mushrooms, no starch. I had hoped for maybe risotto or roasted potatoes with it. My husband's lamb was good, but for $42, he expected more than two small chops. We also had to listen to the woman at the table next to us complain about her steak for nearly the entire evening. But I had to agree with her, if you are paying $52 for a steak, it better be epic. For two starters, two cocktails, entrees and two glasses of wine, we paid $180 including tip. Unfortunately, I can't say it was worth it.",

I'm trying to be thorough about my Pittsburgh food experiences, though, so here goes.  I've been here three times, and each time was slightly less interesting than the one before.  The food averaged to the same quality, but I had expected more creativity and change over time, especially for such a high price.  The food ranges from average to very good, but rarely tops out at excellent (I say this having tried the chef's tasting). I do recommend it, but only because Pittsburgh is sorely lacking in the romantic food date genre.  Docked two stars because the quality is inconsistent, and it's definitely overpriced.",

    "text": "I'm eating dinner at Eleven as I write this, and I have to say that it is one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh.  I had the tasting menu with wine pairing, and the wines were well matched with the food.  Everything was pretty solid, including the service, but I actually felt that they were too attentive.  They weren't extremely busy, and one of their many servers would approach the table every few minutes.  I found this a little awkward, since I was alone and just wanted to eat, although other people might appreciate the personal attention.  Also, the place has some bizarre, concept, surrealistic erotic prints hanging on the walls and is going for the \"East Berlin Hotel Lobby\" decor, so I kind of felt like I was in one of those Mike Myers \"Deitur\" Saturday Night Live skits from the 1990s (\"Would you like to touch my monkey?\")  The best item on the tasting menu by far was the dessert, although the paired dessert wine tasted like straight-up grape juice.  The plates were very seafood-heavy, and they love radishes, the menu is scattered with radish dishes, which is interesting.  I've never been a big fan of the radish, but they don't seem to get used much, so it's a nice try.  The presentation of the food was really good, but I was left a little unimpressed by the flavor.  It's expensive for Pittsburgh, even more than I thought it would be going in.  Overall, though, the wine pairing was reasonable, getting four and a half glasses for $35, when they are charging about $10 for most of their glasses.  If it were a little cheaper, this would definitely be a four-star place.",

    "text": "First review! Let me preface this review by saying that I do not typically criticize restaurants, but Eleven was definitely a bit of a let-down for how highly rated it seems. After all, though my dining companion and I came later on a Monday night, the dining room seemed busy and remained full for much of our time here.  Our experience at Eleven definitely took off to a promising start. The hostess allowed us to book the Chef's Table for two, even though it typically is intended to seat 4-6 people. While it did not give us a particular insightful view of the kitchen, it was definitely offset in a nice cozy alcove with plenty of space to accommodate our voracious appetites!   Unfortunately, our server was not especially friendly or enthusiastic, so we did not get much advice for the appetizers we decided to order before venturing to the Chef's Tasting.  Half-Dozen Oysters | Not too shabby. We were not given any details about the origin of these oysters, so I can only comment that the ELEVEN hot sauce was a very spicy version of cocktail sauce!  Seared Scallops | The scallops themselves had a nice consistency, if a bit rubbery, but they sat on a strange stew of peas and ham that I did not especially enjoy. The heartiness of the flavor seemed to overwhelm the typical delicacy of seared scallops and we left much of it on the plate.  Chef's Tasting Course #1: Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras | Since California's ban on foie gras, I have not had it nearly as often, so I was really looking forward to this appetizer. Yet, though I can normally be convinced to love seared foie gras dish at any price point, I can honestly say that this is one of the worst preparations I have ever tasted. The foie gras itself was far too well-done; of my admitted generous portion, only the very center had the soft, buttery consistency that defines the dish, while the outer portions were a little too much like...liver. It also sat on a strangely incongruent piece of rough breading that added little to the melding of flavors, but our server did not seem to appreciate my asking about what it had been. (Turns out--carrot cake!)  Chef's Tasting Course #2: Seared Salmon | While both my dining companion and I usually enjoy salmon in any form, this \"seared\" salmon had a nearly fried crisp that masked its usual flavor. This dish's saving grace was its bedding of rich polenta that paired surprisingly well with the stark vinegary greens on the side. It was paired rather oddly with a Pinot Noir.  Chef's Tasting Course #3: Jubilee Hilltop Ranch Strip Steak | When our server presented us this grass-fed steak and--exact words--\"tater tots,\" we probably should not have expected too much from this simultaneously rare and stringy cut of meat. The tater tots far outshone the meat itself. Less said the better.  Yellowtail Sashimi | My dining companion was so unimpressed by the steak from the third course that he did not finish it. We did not want to create problems by sending it back, but we added an order for the yellowtail sashimi appetizer to close our meal on a better note. The three slices of slightly fishy yellowtail atop cucumber salad was definitely not the worst nouveau-sauced sashimi either of us have ever had, but again, it was not especially amazing either.  Tasting Menu Dessert for Her: Flourless Chocolate Cake with Bourbon Ice Cream | This dense, rich mass of chocolate was both well presented and delicious! :) Kudos to the pastry chef on this one.  Tasting Menu Dessert for Him: Brown Butter Ice Cream Sandwiches | My dining companion adores ice cream sandwiches, so he may have been a little biased, but I can agree that the combination of oatmeal raisin cookies, cold ice cream, and graham crumbles was indeed magical. Plus, the kitchen did remember to include a piece of chocolate with a message that I had called in earlier--so bonus points there.  Ambitious Dessert to Share: Creme Fraiche Brulee | At the end of the meal, we both commented that dessert was by far the highlight--so much so that we had to try our luck at another. The creme brulee and accompanying jelly macaron were both good but not wonderful. Perhaps another ice cream sandwich might have been better!  Ultimately, the Chef's Tasting Menu & Wine Pairing, while delicious in theory and in description, did not exhibit much innovation or character. We enjoyed elements of each course, but none of them stood out as being particularly memorable. Of the five wines we sampled between the two of us, only the first (2011 Semillon) seemed worth an individual order.  Had our service been more consistent or friendly, I would have been tempted to rate our dinner a 3.5 or 4; however, for how much we were both looking forward to our fine dining experience at Eleven, we just felt underwhelmed at every turn. Maybe we came on an off-night, or perhaps we are just spoiled by LA dining, but I would definitely not make Eleven a priority on future trips to Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Eleven is one of those places we frequent for happy hour on the way home from work. We've tried nearly everything on the happy hour food menu (updated on a fairly regular basis) and I've been a big fan of everything. Currently, the shishito peppers are a great option. They're not too salty or oily, and garnished with just the right amount of manchego. I'm not into the dipping sauce that accompanies them, but that's purely preference, as the peppers are good enough on their own. The mussels are usually excellent, with an ever-changing broth that pairs well with the daily bread varieties that the servers will offer. For $6, you really can't go wrong. Same applies to the happy hour drink specials...I definitely recommend the Eleven Mule!  We've also tried both the tavern menu and dinner menu, but honestly, neither blew me away. The Eleven Burger is highly-rated by so many people, but I honestly didn't like it...at all. The burger, itself (ordered medium), was just chewy and I couldn't taste the meat under the excessive pile of toppings. I could barely get through the bland onion straws that overwhelmed everything...including the blue cheese. Such a disappointment. I'm hoping to try the lamb burger soon, as we often see it pass by, and it looks excellent. Also, as someone from Baltimore, I should've known better than to order the crab cake sandwich. A lot of bread, a tiny amount of crab cake (looked like claw meat, as well). Poor choice on my part, but at a place like Eleven, I really expected a more impressive effort.  The dinner menu is a bit stronger, but it'll hit your wallet pretty hard. Is it worth it? I'm still undecided. I tried the lamb chop (which doesn't seem to be on the current menu). It was good, but dry, which is probably one of the reasons that I haven't been tempted towards the dinner menu again. They did have an excellent tomato salad (also not on the current menu), which is actually what convinced us to stay for dinner in the first place. The atmosphere is definitely fitting if you're looking to impress on a date or business dinner, and the staff is excellent and usually very nice. The menu reads as fine dining, and certainly is priced as such, so come prepared to spend quite a bit. As mentioned before, our verdict is out on whether or not it's worth the cost, but I'm willing to try the full-on dinner experience again at some point. Until then, we'll continue to enjoy the excellent happy hour drinks and bites, nice bar staff, and inviting atmosphere. At a minimum, it's definitely worth stopping in for that.",

Anyways, we got the jumbo crab cake as an appetizer. HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN! It was the most delicious, freshest crab meat I've ever had. There were these fingerling potatoes with them that were so incredible.  My boyfriend got the tenderloin and I got chicken. Our food was exceptional... So amazing.

I ordered medium but it was cooked well, I didn't complain because it was still juicy and tasty.  Also, usually after eating huge burgers, I typically feel awful and want to lay in bed until I die, but this burger did not put me into such a death like state, which makes me think that they don't add unnecessary amounts of sodium and their ingredients are high quality.  The service was fine, nothing to complain about, but nothing to brag about. I found no one at the restaurant to be super friendly.  The place is gorgeous, would like to return for something other than a burger.",

Both times the food was phenomenal and the service was impeccable. I decided for my birthday dinner that Eleven would be the place to celebrate. We got there a few minutes before our 5 pm reservation. We were greeted warmly and immediately seated. I love the vibe at Eleven. It is chic yet warm and relaxing. We were promptly greeted by our waiter (I am sorry that I cannot remember his name - I am so bad with names - he was fantastic). He was friendly, informative, and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We ordered apps and drinks to start. I chose the sea scallops which were perfect and paired with a red flannel hash. I had never heard of red flannel hash before and all I have to say about that is...where have you been hiding red flannel hash? Wow...what flavors...beets (never a fan but now I know how good a beet can be), potatoes, amongst other miscellaneous good stuff. Who knew? I got the Sangria as well which is light and was a delight! The hubby got a beer (I cannot remember what he chose but it was terrific). He got the sashimi for his app which was fresh and refreshing. For my entree I chose the pork chop that came with grits. The meat, of course, cooked perfectly. And the grits in stick form and oh so delicious! The hubby got the steak and it came with mashed potatoes. Again the meat was perfect and the potatoes were creamy and amazing as well. Both pieces of meat fresh and tender and juicy. For dessert I got the spice cake in a little bit if apple cider with vanilla ice cream...wow! The hubby got the chocolate cake and ice cream...wow! And to end the meal a Carmel in sea salt that the pastry chef prepared...I just don't have the adjectives to describe how fabulous everything was. From beginning to end it was a truly awesome dining experience. Eleven, never let me down...so yummy!",

I'm sure within minutes he was annoyed with us, but hey, we were a group of friends celebrating a birthday and enjoying ourselves.  So, on with my review!  We started at the bar where we waited for some of our group to arrive as we were the first there.  The drinks were really great, but our bartenders lacked so much personality that it was sickening.  I dont know why, but we seemed to be an utter annoyance to the guy serving us, and at this point we were just 3 or 4 people sitting at a bar ordering cocktails, so I'm not sure what the attitude was about, but whatever.  We paid our tab and went to our table.  Once we were seated, we had a really good experience for the most part.  Our service was great I thought (bless that poor man! haha!), and I really enjoyed everything I ordered.  The carrott soup was incredible, and my entree was delicious.  In my opinion, considering how loud and difficult I'm sure we were, our server did a great job and I never really felt like he was burdened or impatient with us.  We sat in a semi-private area (thank God) which was really nice, for us and those around us, and it was the perfect setting for our group.    The valet parking situation could be improved, but I dont really have any complaints- it just seems like there may be a more efficient way to do it and the waiting space and valet stand is really cramped and can get uncomfortable if there are a lot of people waiting.  There seems to be plenty of self parking available, but valet is really reasonable and makes it easy.",

We decided to just order dinner, no appetizers, although the apps sounded very good. We ordered the Swordfish , it was very tasty and fresh, coming with fresh green beans and multicolored peppers. The Seafood Sampler, which was also tasty, however the piece of swordfish was small and only one sea scallop, but a very large crab cake. The crab cake was good, filled with lots of lump crab, just wished  a larger piece of swordfish and maybe 2 scallops, and a smaller crab cake. The vegetable for this dish was \"creamed corn\", but not the typical creamed corn, it had andouille sausage in it. Also ordered was the Beef Tenderloin, one was ordered medium-perfectly cooked and seasoned appropriately, the other ordered rare and came also perfectly cooked. The potato gnocchi were light and airy, with great flavor, lovely wild mushrooms with the dish. The blue cheese that came with the dish was not subtle. We opted forgoing dessert, since we were full , but the dessert menu looked extremely good.",

On my last visit to Eleven (and I do mean last) my wife and I thought we had been transported to some other universe. Grumpy parking valet, grim hostess, uncaring waiter who wanted to be somewhere else. All of these things so unlike all of our previous visits.   Maybe I could try to overlook these shortcomings as a bad day or their personal problems. But, when the rack of lamb was served I was sure Rod Serling had to be lurking somewhere in the shadows. The lamb (my very favorite entree) was rubber. Could not be cut with a steak knife.   It was our anniversary and I didn't want to make what my wife would probably define as a scene. Also, I was so flabbergasted by the entire disastrous experience I said nothing. When the waiter took away the uneaten rubber lamb I was sure he would ask why I hadn't finished my tire. But no, nothing.   It's sad since I had enjoyed the place so much in the past. Well, nothing lasts forever.",

    "text": "Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher this year, I decided to go to Eleven to redeem it.  Two friends accompanied me for my visit on Sun., 12/13, and I was able to given them each a $10 off voucher, so we all were able to receive a discount on an otherwise pricey dinner, which is always nice.  Overall, we were quite impressed with our experience, as the details below will show.  Although we all decided to forego appetizers, we were served bread from a bread basket containing three varieties.  Of the three types we tried, I enjoyed the sea salt focaccia best.  The only thing that's a bit strange is that, instead of placing a basket on the table, they dole it out by the slice, but you can request two slices at a time if you so desire, as I did.  The night of our visit, the entree list was pretty seafood heavy, so all three of us ordered seafood entrees.  My friends ordered the seared salmon and the walleye pike ($28 each), and I ordered the seafood tasting ($36).  The seafood tasting consisted of a crab cake, a sea scallop, and salmon topped with shishito peppers and salt and vinegar chips over some seafood chowder.  The crab cake was generous in size and consisted of lump crab meat with no pepper and very little filler.  It was definitely one of the best crab cakes I've had, which is saying something given that I went to high school and college on the Eastern Shore of MD.  The seared salmon was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, just as salmon should ideally be.  The sea scallop was also very large and meaty, and tasted appropriately (I must confess I'm not a huge scallop fan).  The chowder and chips made for a nice presentation and accompanied the main components of the dish well.  The only component of the dish that I didn't really care much for were the peppers--but then again, I'm not a big fan of spicy green peppers.  I tried bites of my friends' entrees, and they were both delicious, as well.  After finishing our entrees, we sprung for dessert.  I was torn between the warm dark chocolate cake and the candy bar desserts ($10 each), so when my friends ordered the former, I went for the latter.  I'm really glad I went for the candy bar dessert, since it was absolutely delicious!  It consisted of chocolate olive oil cake, chocolate malt ice cream, and peanut butter sauce, and they even included a piece of white chocolate on which they wrote happy birthday because I mentioned that it was my birthday.  I also tried a bite of my friends' dessert.  While it was delicious, I enjoyed the candy bar dessert more, so I made the right decision.  Needless to say, my friends and I very much enjoyed our dinner at Eleven.  The quality of the ambiance and service matched that of the food, making for a comprehensively wonderful experience.  I've since learned that the head chef will be leaving in a couple of months to start his own restaurant.  I wish him great success in that endeavor, and trust that the new chef, who currently heads Casbah, will be a worthy replacement.  If you're looking for a classy place to dine, I highly recommend Eleven--it easily makes my top 10 restaurant experiences in PGH.",

The presentation of the smoked salmon app classed-up what is essentially a deconstructed lox bagel, but the taste is otherwise standard.  My gf's linguini with citrus butter, garlic, zucchini, spinach, and crab really just tasted like lemon juice.  Probably avoid that option.  The fried chicken and biscuits was rich and savory.

We decided on the $30 brunch deal which gives you a cocktail or fresh juice, appetizer, and an entree. Fresh biscuits and jam come to the table as well. We all loved the biscuits! Yum!! I went with the cinnamon roll and eggs Benedict, with a mimosa as my cocktail. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the cinnamon roll because it was probably one of the best ones I have ever had. The eggs Benedict was also yummy. My cocktail tasted like fresh squeezed juice which I loved. Very refreshing. Both of my friends enjoyed their entrees as well and we didn't leave anything on our plates :) Our server was friendly and effiWe can't wait to return when the weather is warmer.   Updated review for dinner: I came here also for my birthday dinner-servers were polite and friendly. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but they do offer valet parking. Food was amazing! Dinner is very pricy if you are willing to spend the money on a fancy night out. Luckily we had a bday coupon. I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the steak! Delicious!",

We also ordered a side of the beignets to share. Sweet little squares of dough sprinkle with powdered sugar, toasted coconut and a kumquat puree to help cut the sweetness. We also had the oysters, short rib hash, steak and eggs and burger.   The brunch cocktails included in the price are great too. They don't skimp on the alcohol in them, which is the norm for a fixed price menu. At least what we have experienced in the past.   Our server Nicole was fabulous. Very attentive and super sweet. We love Eleven, and have recommended it to many people. Great food, wonderful service and fantastic food. We will be back.",

For dinner,  I went with the linguini. It was served with crab. The dish was very flavorful but not heavy. It was excellent.  My husband ordered the swordfish. It was served with black risotto. The swordfish was seasoned & cooked perfectly. So many unique flavors. It was probably one of the best fish dishes I've had.  Our server celebrated my birthday by bringing out homemade hazelnut truffles. Also, an edible happy birthday sign.   The restuarant has a limited menu which is good. It gives them the opportunity to perfect the dish. Also, dining area isnt large, so you get the service that you deserve.   The food at Eleven was top notch. I just wish it wasnt  so pricey. I could enjoy it more often. The food is great but $40-50 a plate great? Ugh I'm still deciding but damn it was good.   I would go back again. I would love to try the brunch. Also, since the menu is seasonal & the food is so perfect, I would love to stop in to try the new menu.",

The people are welcoming. We went there on our anniversary. Not only the waiters congratulated us for the special day, the dessert also had a \"happy anniversary\" chocolate.   The food is delicious. I liked the soft, light butter for the pre-meal bread. We tried the Valentine's day tasting menu and most of them are really good.  Prime Beef Tartare is one of the best I've tasted. I meat is soft and fresh. Black Mission Fig & Smoked Ricotta is made of crispy lamb, chicory, thyme honey, Banyuls vinaigrette, pistachio. The combination of different tastes made the dish interesting. Black Truffle Cavatelli and Swordfish were not as good as the previous two. One was salty and the other one was dry. (Or it is because i am full by that time so i am more picky. lol) Not on the tasting menu, the lamb chop and butters squash soup are also very good choices.",

    "text": "We had dinner here on a Saturday night, making early reservations for 6 PM. The hostess station was awkwardly overstaffed when we arrived and our greeting was sterile. Not off to a great start.  We are seated upstairs and the ambiance is interesting. It overlooks the bar, so for better or worse the television is within view. Our waitress comes and we are told there are no specials as the chef likes to mix things up. The chef changes the menu frequently. She mentioned the chicken and beef tenderloin were traditional choices.  I ordered the swordfish because the accompanying forbidden rice & rock shrimp risotto intrigued me. Hubs ordered the beef tenderloin. My in-laws ordered the pork chop and lamb loin.   A man walks over to offer individual options for bread--raisin, focaccia, and two others that don't come to mind. The bread was good, but awkward that we were given a piece of bread each and he never returns.    Our crab cake to share, which was delicious, with a mild cocktail like sauce at the base.  We waited a long time for the entrees to arrive. We were finished with the appetizers long before and the entrees didn't arrive until 7:15 or so. Hubs finished his beer before the food came. The waitress apologize as she said the kitchen was backed up by two larger groups, but the restaurant wasn't packed. During that time she didn't even offered to send the bread back to our table. Boo.  Food comes and it was amazing. The swordfish and risotto were cooked perfectly. The flavors of the risotto was savory and the pieces of shrimp very noticeable and delicious. I did find that there was too much salt and olive oil that took away from the food. I had a bite of Hub's beef tenderloin and gnocchi. The beef was tender and flavorful and the goat cheese complemented it well. The gnocchi was more pan fried and had a nice crunch to it. My mother-in-law enjoyed her lamb. She rarely eats more than half her dinner and she was almost joined the Clean Plate Club had it not been for a piece of brussel sprout and carrot. She had us try the polenta as she was in awe with the texture and flavor. It had a cornmeal taste and felt like comfort food. Yum. My father-in-law had the pork chop and we were in awe with the lovely presentation. It was hearty and he enjoyed it.  For dessert, Hubs and I shared the warm chocolate cake. The hard later of chocolate on top made it difficult to eat. With the entrees so sizeable, the dessert was disappointingly small. Not a bad thing if you're trying not to over indulge after dinner.  The food is legitimately good. It's expensive, but factoring in the size of the entree, it was well worth it. The service was average. It was a long wait for the food, with several awkward incidents during our experience.",

We were greeted with doors opened and coats checked, which are small details that always add to the experience for me.   We started with cocktails that were excellent. I had the Starry Night which was refreshing and a great mix of flavors. I the ordered the cava which was also great. The have an extensive wine list!  We started off with a cheese plate. You can pick from a big list of cheeses and they bring you a delicious platter. We also had the blue bay mussels which were some of the best I've ever had.   For the main course, I enjoyed the tenderloin with gnocchi. It was a very large cut and cooked perfectly. My friend ordered the linguine and said it was excellent and loaded with seafood!   For dessert, we shared the warm dark chocolate cake and trio of ice cream. The cheesecake ice cream was MOUTH WATERING and I loved the espresso anglaise on the cake.   Overall, excellent experience. Would absolutely recommend Eleven, especially if you're celebrating!",

I had the heirloom tomato salad to start. If you love fresh tomatoes then you'd love this. For dinner I ordered the seafood sampler that comes with halibut, crab cake and one jumbo scallop.

There are two floors of the restaurant including an outside patio and a bar area. When we arrived, We were seated right away and ordered the red sangria and maple mash for drinks. Both cocktails were absolutely delicious and very well made. They also bring out a bread basket with freshly baked mini pastries that are made at the restaurant with homemade jam and butter that is absolutely delicious. For appetizers, we had the pork belly and beignets. For main course, we ordered the eleven burger and the steak and egg. The entrees are definitely on the heavier side though so be prepared if you order either of these.   Pork belly 10/10. This was recommended to us by our waiter and I will definitely order it again next time I go to brunch here. The pork belly comes with cornbread and a perfectly cooked egg.   Beignets 10/10. On the sweeter side but very delicious.   Eleven burger 10/10. Burger cooked perfectly, comes with bacon, your choice of cheese, crispy onions and fries.   Steak and egg 10/10. cooked perfectly and comes with grits.   This place is definitely the best brunch I've had in Pittsburgh. Can't wait to come back and sample some of their other items.  Tip: this is part of the big burrito group so if you sign up they send you a $30 gift entree for your birthday.",

The fries were delicious and the lobster had a LEMON zest which I DON'T like on my meat but it was good.  I wish it was more garlicky, cheesy or had a seasoned mayonnaise on it.

    "text": "I'm giving Eleven 5 stars because they handled our party of 20 so well! I can't speak to the average dining experience for a couple there though. Our large group had a private room upstairs and they made sure to have an adequate number of staff to take care of the large party. They were regularly refilling wine and water and food came out timely and to the right seats. We had prix fix menu. I tried the onion saffron soup. It was a unique taste and I enjoyed it but I think some people in our party found it a little strange and didn't finish their bowls. The appetizer combo- including a scallop was tender and tasty. I had the salmon entree which was well put together. There was a desert selection with mini pastries that were all enjoyable. The restaurant, outside of our private room on the second floor, was very dimly lit. I wouldn't mind but for some folks it may be a bit dark.",

He understood that we were short on time (had to catch a flight), so he allowed us to review the dinner menu, and he put our order in exactly at 5 pm!  Drinks: I ordered the Kentucky Sunset - a mixture of bourbon, cherry liqueur, hops (and another ingredient). It was delish! Felt niiccceee.  Food: I had the Virginian oysters and oysters from Massachusetts. The Virginian oysters were very bland;  not briny at all. However, the oysters from Massachusetts were very tasty. I loved the briny, mineral taste. The Virginian oysters were on the happy hour menu and the Massachusetts oysters were only offered full price.  I also had the Swordfish. It was served grilled and with forbidden rice and shrimp risotto. I rarely finish an entree, but this was so good that I had to finish it! The swordfish had a great sear to it. The forbidden rice was seasoned well. It was simply a well-executed dish.  Eleven will definitely be on my return list if I ever visited Pittsburgh again. The restaurant has a very chic and classy feel to it. Great for happy hour, dinner with the girls or date night.",

From start to finish their meals never, ever disappoint!   I started with the beet salad, which sometimes doesn't sound all that exciting on a menu, but of course they found a way to bring in such a depth of flavors and texture that I almost asked for another!   I added scallops to the ricotta cavatelli and it just made this already amazing dish next level.   I tell myself to try a different dessert every time, but the banana cream pie always wins!   Another amazing meal and time at Eleven! Such a gem here in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Returned here for dinner before the fiance's graduation the next day.   We both went with the Chef's Tasting Menu.  A lovely woman came around more than three or four times with the nightly selection of breads which included a honey wheat that was the only one worth noting.  Considering the fact that they make the bread I would have hoped to have something that was at least warmed up a bit.   What we sampled:  Foie Gras Torchon     sage waffle, apricot, Riesling, rhubarb       One of the best foie gras torchons I have ever had!  It was a huge portion though and the amount of waffle did not complement the size, but luckily it tasted wonderfully on the honey wheat bread.  Soft Shell Crab in Dashi      I don't remember the other accompaniments, but I do know this was my least favorite dish.  The crab was fresh, but the broth made a nicely fried crab soggy.  Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin Chop   Anson Mills polenta, fava beans, morels, grapes, garlic confit, olive jus        Oh my!  Out of control flavorful and the polenta was so good!   Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bar  peanut caramel, white chocolate crunch, chocolate mousse, milk chocolate ganache  Lemon Pudding Cake  coconut milk granite, jasmine tea syr up, blackber ry compote, macadamia nuts       They gave us the option to change the dessert and since I knew that two of the same desserts would mean half of the tastes we decided to get something refreshing and of course try the chocolate bar.  This was the best call they worked so well together rich and light playing off of each other!  They were also nice enough to add a piece of chocolate with congratulations piped on it for the graduating man!  Overall the service was efficient and helpful (changing up a menu item to satisfy a pescatarian).  I thought that the price without the wine pairings was reasonable for what we received though I don't know when I would be back for dinner since I am obsessed with the bread basket at brunch.",

Quite a posh eatery with high ceilings and elegant decor.  We came here for Sunday brunch, which they had a prix fixe menu for $25 (appetizer, entree, and a drink).  We started our meal with complimentary baked goods like croissants and muffins that came with a side of homemade marmalade (roasted pineapple with lime).  Yummmm!  Then unlike most prix fixe menus, this menu had many options to choose from.  For appetizers, they had items like oysters, truffled egg toast, serrano ham, shrimp salad, crab cakes, etc.  I got the crab cake that was alright (I've had better).  For entree, there were choices like lobster roll, vanilla bean belgian waffle, lobster & caviar omelet, and even shrimp pasta.  I got the lobster & caviar open-faced omelet with mascarpone.  Interesting concept and nicely prepared.  For brunch of this calibre, $25 was a bargain.",

Often the chef's samples impress me despite ingredients I would never seek out. The service is slavish and witty. Ask for balsamic vinegar with the bread because it tastes sweet like it costs $100 per bottle, which it might. When they ask which type of bread you want, say one of each. The burger is a must at lunch. They have the best salmon I have found in Pittsburgh. The seafood tasting has been great each time I have had it. The desserts are works of art. The crab cakes are great.  If you are reading this and considering eating here, just do yourself a favor and make it happen. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "First time at Eleven on Saturday night for my girlfriend's birthday. We had an 8 PM reservation and were pleasantly surprised by the valet parking as parking in the Strip District can be a hassle. The restaurant is deceivingly large compared to what one expects when approaching from outside. The decor was \"efficient\" with the ever-present dim lighting of fancy restaurants.   We ordered cocktails: the Eleven-ade and the Prohibition Martini, which, while delicious, were quite pricey. For appetizers we tried a raw goat's milk cheese as well as the butternut squash ravioli. The cheese plate was mediocre and I was a little surprised to see a wedge of what appeared to be canned cranberry sauce accompanying the dish. The ravioli were absolutely delicious and I would have happily eaten a full serving of those for my entree.  My girlfriend ordered the seafood tasting and I ordered the NY strip (medium rare). I was very impressed by the quality of the seafood... the shrimp and grits consisted of what appeared to be U10-12 prawns and the crab cake was full of lump crab and not just breading. The steak was cooked perfectly and accompanied by pierogies, which I thought was a classy Pittsburgh spin on the traditional steak and potatoes. With our entrees we enjoyed a bottle of Amisfield Pinot Noir from New Zealand. The wine list was not what I would consider \"expansive\" compared to other restaurants, but they did have a good selection to pair with the menu.  For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake and the ice cream/sorbet. Paired with a glass of tokaji and port, this rounded out a wonderful meal.  The only reason I give Eleven four stars vs. five is due to the knowledge of our server. When asked questions regarding some of the dishes, he struggled to provide input.  I definitely plan to return to Eleven in the future and agree with the other reviews that rate this restaurant as one of the best fine dining options in Pittsburgh.",

Was a little strange to pull up to a nice restaurant on an otherwise industrial looking road, but once inside, you could never tell you weren't in San Francisco or some other, more hip city.  Nice ambiance, and good acoustics (meaning not having to shout).  We sat down and got some tasty fresh baked bread.  Amuse of goat cheese with some sort of berry smear.  We both had the three greens salad, which was nice.  Not outstanding, but heck, it was a good salad.  But the entrees were fantastic.  I had the lamb, and it was delicious.  A little on the salty side, but then again, my cravings are for salt, and not sugar, so that was OK by me.  My dining companion had the bass, and said it was quite good.  Finished off with the coffee and doughnuts, which was their version of coffee creme brulee with beignets.  Very nice finish to a very nice meal.  Overall, great service, great food, and great ambiance.",

    "text": "I have been to Eleven several times since moving to pittsburgh and i figured it was about time for a quick review.  yet again, Big Burrito Group never fails to impress. I have had dinner there more than a couple times, but since this  establishment has already been reviewed over 100 times, i will just touch upon my most recent visit (Saturday Nov. 26, 2011) where my wife an i just sat in the bar area and ordered off the tavern menu.   I want to not that you can order off of the whole dinner menu if you like after 6pm (i think, might be 5:30).   We each grabbed a couple beers, they have a 'winter solstice' lager ( i forget the brewery) which was great and very cold off of draft.  The wait staff in the tavern area is great, never rush, and are helpful at getting you seated in a decent time frame.  seating here is a first come first serve with about 6-7 four person tables and about 12 bar spots.  We split the goat cheese and onion perogies, with veal jus on top, which were were very tasty and were perfect size to split for an appetizer.  For dinner, we each got the eleven burger.  To call this culinary  creation a burger does not due it justice.  The menu describes it as : Eleven Burger $16.  braised veal, black pepper bacon, crispy onions, fries with a choice of cheddar, Maytag Blue, goat cheese, Emmenthaler Swiss.  I know,  a $16 ;burger', but it is more than worth the cost.  you will take one bite and all other burgers that you thought were standouts will quickly fade from your memory.  Quite simply, this is the perfect modern interpretation of a what burger can be.    Had to pass on desert this last time as the burger and beers were very filling, but complementary chocolate macadamin bark was great (as was the complementary champange we had due to an over order or miscommunication  at another table).    There many reasons why Eleven is considered to be one of the best, if not the best, restaurant in Pittsburgh and their 'tavern menu and service' is just another one of those very reasons.",

I know it's going off the menu soon for the season but the peach whiskey tea is one of the best drinks available in pittsburgh. The food is really good too. The Salmon was great, the pork chop was good, and I thought the foie gras was forgettable.I like that they rotate the menu every day and source a lot of things locally. This may be a nit-picky thing but I'm put of by the bench seating. I think that's pretty tacky for an upscale restaurant. I also don't like the fact that they don't seem to have tables for two. If I'm on a date having a nice meal, I think it's odd to sit at a six-top. Generally I think the service is good not great but was underwhelmed last time I was there.

He also mentioned that they like to use a lot of local ingredients in their menu with seasonal offerings.  This place definitely did not disappoint.  I liked the decor in this place.  It looks like an old converted warehouse with exposed brick and wood beam ceiling.  Modern look with a good vibe.  I think it can get a little loud if you're taking clients there. That might be something to think about if you need to talk business.            We started with the cheese platter, blue bay mussels, sea scallops, and a prosciutto platter special.  They were all very excellent.  I especially liked the prosciutto platter.  As for the entree, I had the pork chop.  This was really good.  I really liked the fact that it came with pork belly.  Yum.  Tasty.  As for everyone else, they all ordered the beef tenderloin and they all agreed that it was good.       The ambiance, service, and food were all great.

My meal, which was in part shared with the others I ate with:  oysters, Pumpkin ravioli, cod, lamb (a saddle cut of shoulders and flank), pumpkin creme brulee, and a cheese platter that held some an amazing triple cream brie that I will probably never forget.  It was an evening of eating food as slowly as possible because the scent and flavor were so fantastic I forgot all about hunger or anything else for that matter.  Our waiter was also fantastic- obviously very knowledgeable about what was on the menu and funny too. When we arrived we commented that we were cold and the heat was turned up right away- this was both relieving and impressive.   The atmosphere of the place was pretty fantastic on it's own. I can't see myself being able to afford the type of meal I'm reviewing on a regular basis, but it was a great introduction to a few things I'll return for in the future.  For alcohol  we had both a red and white that were excellent ( though the names escape me) but the wine of the night that stole my heart was a Sauternes from Bordeaux that I plan on buying as soon as I can locate a  merchant selling it.  All in all a fantastic place. I will return.  Menu is on line for details.  Appetizers $8-$20  Main course $ 20-$60 (some main courses were tasting meals)  Wines and liqueurs- $8 on up to OMG...",

First of all, sitting upstairs is an entirely different experience from sitting downstairs. It's so much prettier and more regal to sit downstairs (we were upstairs and it almost felt like a bar setting). Second of all, the service was absolutely terrible. When I wanted more bread, I had to ask at least 3 times. We waited over an hour between our appetizers and entrees. We were all starving and our food and waiter were no where to be found. Although we enjoyed the conversation among our table, it was a bit ridiculous that our meal (not a tasting menu) lasted 2.5+ hours (and most of the time we spent ravenous waiting four our food). The food itself was good, but not spectacular. The lamb taco was lacking flavor. The sword fish was very good, but there were two tiny pieces of sausage in the entire dish. The seafood platter was good, but the center of my scallop was cold and the salmon had an extremely strong flavor. The crab cake was delicious and was basically pure crab meat with no filler. One of my dining partners got the chicken dish and one got the lamb chop - both said they were only \"okay.\" The desserts were fairly good (we tried the peach cannoli, a peach dish with blueberry ice cream, and a chocolate dessert). When we wanted the check, our waiter was no where to be found. We looked over downstairs and he was shmoozing on the floor below. Overall, it was a mediocre experience. I much prefer the other Big Burrito restaurants, which is unfortunate because I was so excited for my experience at Eleven.

The meat part of the fois gras was cooked perfect but I believe would pair better with something else than the crunchy cracker and a few pomegranate seeds. The wait was extremely long between appetizers and main course with no explanation or apology. Unfortunately, that's what sticks out when I reflect on my dinner at Eleven.",

(Our server did seem a bit off; however, I feel like this may have been because our chemistries just didn't mix. I'm assuming he was an outlier.) Starting with the bread basket, I was most impressed by the lightly salted focaccia bread. For my entree, I went with a vegetarian dish - the Riccolina pasta (elbow pasta with walnuts, kale, and pumpkin). This was positively delicious and more filling than I had expected. Eventually, I had to give up trying to finish it. For dessert, I went with the creme brule. Sadly, I did regret this decision as this dish was predictable and seemed to pale in comparison to the more inventive choices. (Also, the custard was a bit warm and the texture a bit watery.) Other than that, I left satisfied and will definitely be making a return visit.",

    "text": "Oh, Eleven, Eleven how I love thee!!  You truly are the restaurant love of my life - you are the whole package - fantastic food, phenomenal wine list, great service, relaxing and classy decor and ambiance - you have it all.  On our most recent visit I told our server about my loft idea should I ever win the lottery and she liked the idea so much that told me that now she hopes that SHE wins the lottery because she is going to steal my idea! That being said my darling, we need to talk, about size.  I remember the first time I had the Eleven Burger for my birthday in September 2006.  It was the first ever gourmet burger that I had ever eaten and I fell in love - it was the best burger in town and not only was it delicious with braised veal and bacon on top with white cheddar and the crispy onions but it was HUGE and only $11.  I couldn't even finish it and took half home.  Fast forward to 2015 - I still love the burger - I will challenge anyone who says that it isn't STILL the best one in Pittsburgh and I even defend the now $16 price tag and the ever shrinking size, but still earlier this month when we were there for brunch I took half of my burger home.  So, imagine our surprise when we used our annual $10 off coupons (and I always feel a little dirty even using coupons at Big Burrito establishments because, well it's FINE dining, but hey, I frequent the restaurants enough that I feel that I've spent a fair amount of money to support getting some perks once in a while).  Anyhow, I digress, imagine our surprise when our burgers came out and they were so small that we joked that soon the burger was going to be the size of a slider.  We just had the burger at the beginning of the month, and now the other day it was even smaller than before (the incredibly shrinking burger).  So, I wondered, given that I politely had our coupons displayed for the server to see, were we perhaps given the $10 off coupon size burger?  Say it isn't so, but even if it is...(cue the music)...And I will always loooooove you!!  I will always love yoooooou!  But, please don't give me \"coupon\" portions again.  LOVE YOU!",

    "text": "I've done the vegetarian tasting menu twice now. My first experience (over a year ago) seemed elegant, with proper service and a no-trouble attitude about veganizing the tasting menu; the food was solidly \"good,\" but not memorable. The second time (recently), it was a bit more difficult to squeeze the vegan knowledge and ability out of the staff, even though I did call ahead to ask if a vegan diet could be accommodated when I made my reservation. Our server seemed casual and inexperienced, though friendly and he did eventually come through with the information I needed to decide on my meal options. Again, the food was just \"good.\" I do realize that Eleven is considered one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants and if I were weighing it against Pittsburgh establishments alone, I might add a star. But I feel that its reputation brings it into the major league, allowing me to unapologetically compare it to the world beyond Steelers Country.   The distinguishing features of Eleven, I think, are in the breads (try them all, best breads in the city!) and and wine pairings, which I believe are very well done. I've also attended a happy hour here, and I thought the cocktails tasted expertly crafted. You might also say that the architecture of the building is remarkable.",

We arrived early for our reservation, they took our coats and seated us right away upstairs in an alcove that overlooked the entrance.

Our waiter was slightly snotty but he was very quick to take our orders and check on us throughout the evening.  I had to try the red sangria as I heard it was fabulous and it sure was. The bread is made in house and so tasty that you need to make sure not to fill up on it. My date ordered the pork belly-not my thing but he raved about it.  I ordered the pork which came with beets, cheesy grits (fantastic), onion rings and molasses sauce. The flavor combo was perfect and it melted in your mouth. My date ordered the swordfish which came with scallops, calamari and pasta which he too enjoyed.  I wish we had saved room for dessert as there were so many great options including a seasonal ginger snap, pumpkin dessert.  Can't wait to go back!",

For the price of the meal, sometimes I wish the service had something a little more special to it.  One great, if underrated, feature is the variety of bread choices they have.  When the server comes around to ask you what you'd like, don't be afraid to try a few different varieties.  Their tasting menus are great choices and you should get plenty to eat over the various courses.  The portions aren't huge, but the flavors are rich and complex, which helps to fill you up.  Both their seafood and meats are high quality selections and cooked perfectly every time.  The bar area is very chic, almost like something you could find in Las Vegas.  Their wine menu is extensive and there are some good, decently priced offerings (again, considering the overall price-point of this restaurant).  This would be an impressive date restaurant.  If you get cold easily, you might want to dress with long sleeves or bring a jacket or shawl or something.  There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, and depending on where you're sitting and how the A/C is blowing, you might get a chill!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner!  I was drawn in by their swanky website and delicious, fresh-sounding food.  The valet was only $5, which I thought was amazing compared to the $10 you find in Chicago.  We were seated immediately, with a reservation and the hostess asked us what kind of water we wanted.  It was brought out promptly, which was nice - it feels good to at least have something to sip before the server arrives.  Our server was both speedy and knowledgeable.  I was concerned that one of our appetizers and my entree would be too similar in flavor (and thus repetitive/boring), but he told me that this would not be so - both were made of lamb, but different cuts and uniquely prepared.  Indeed he was right, and I'm glad I listened to him!  I began with the Pear-secco cocktail: pear vodka, pear nectar, and Prosecco.  The drink was elegant and refreshingly not-too-sweet.  It tasted like a fresh pear, and wasn't too sugary or watered down.  I savored it throughout the meal.  Our first bites were of oysters - they were about $2 each, so we sprung for 4.  They were served on a bed of ice with two different hot sauce mixes - one more traditional and one specialty housemade.  I preferred the traditional, but actually chose to eat neither with the oyster.  The oysters were fresh and succulent on their own, no sauce required.  For appetizers, we shared the grilled peaches and the smoked lamb taco.  The lamb taco was absolutely excellent - there was a tortilla buried under smoky, juicy lamb, creamy lentils (in the place of refried beans), and flavorful salsa.  We were nearly licking the plate at the end.  We were both a bit underwhelmed by the grilled peaches - the peaches themselves were nice, as was the goat cheese and berry drizzle, but the \"Surryano\" ham didn't do it for us.  And that's not a typo, it really is Surryano ham - never heard of it.  It was too....smoky, perhaps?  It had a dusky flavor that was unappealing to us both, which greatly affected the enjoyment of the overall dish.  But to be fair, when you separate the dish into its components, most of them were excellent.  For my entree, I had the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb, which the server highly recommended.  It was truly excellent - juicy, luscious, and would convert someone in an instant who claims not to like lamb.  The accompanying polenta was wonderfully creamy.  My boyfriend got the Heritage Farms Chicken which he enjoyed very much - I took a bite and found it to be juicy!  No dessert, since I had a cake waiting for me at home, but the server brought out two caramels sprinkled with sea salt (DEE-LISH) on a plate, and someone had drizzled chocolate on the plate to spell \"Happy birthday Meredith!\"  It was a lovely personal touch, and sweet that they threw in something special.    It's a pricey meal, but it was unquestionably the best we've had in Pittsburgh so far.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has something to celebrate!",

    "text": "Setting the stage: Anniversary, first month in Pittsburgh, searching for great restaurants, got the tasting with wine pairing to celebrate Quite excited to get to Eleven due to the good reviews. My husband has the meat pairing and I had the veggie. For each round of courses one of ours was delicious while the other was just interesting. I would say that the food was 3-4 stars for being unique though not all great. The problem was with the wine. Each wine pairing was poorly explained and mixed between the two of us (really every time). As a huge wine lover, I was disappointed and kept thinking you just don't pay $200 for a meal for two for that kind of service. The waiter had said he was new so I figured I should just let the manager know he needed a bit more training. So frustrating. Explained the situation to the manager and didn't even get an apology. The waiter later apologized but never the manager.  I could imagine a situation where appetizers and wine are great, however it is just not worth the money for the pairing when the service is bad.",

    "text": "After never eating here before, I decided to be a little risky and surprise my girl by taking her here for Valentines Day. I had made reservations a few weeks in advanced and had flowers that were to be ordered on our table. Being a little nervous that the flower coordination would get mixed up with our reservation time, I called a few days in advance to let them know that flowers would be coming. I had reservations for 9:15pm, we got there a little after nine and waited a few minutes for our table. Luckily to my surprise I didn't have to say anything to the Hostess as my flowers were at my table waiting for me. Big relief and big thank you to the staff for getting it right!  We had a friendly waiter, I believe his name was Dave though his name might of slipped my mind after the drinks we had but he was a great waiter. We had lots of questions about the cocktail menu and the dinner/valentine special because we have never been here before but  he was very courteous to us and gave advice where he could. It was a busy night being the occasion but it never felt like he wasn't around.   To start, my girl got the Red Sangria and a wonderful blend of apple, lime, orange and mint tickled her taste-buds. I opted to get the Bluehound gin and tonic with white peppercorn, grapefruit and mint. It was also very delectable and thirst quenching. For our appetizer we decided to get the Tuna Tartare. I'm use to eating Tuna in a can so for both of us, this was rich with taste as it was topped with anchovies and caviar. For our main course, the lady ordered the Salmon which was topped and drizzled with some kind of potato cream, brussel sprouts, beets, and apple slices. As a salmon lover, the sides didn't really seem appealing to me but it ended up being pretty tasteful after sneaking a few bites of her meal. She loved it and didn't leave much on her plate. I on the other hand choose the Grilled Swordfish. My was it tasty! I would definitely get it again. It came with a handful of clams and mussels and some kind of potato pasta-ish type thing. All were very good and both meals were of nice portion size.  Throughout the dinner, a girl with a basket of bread came around about 3 times offering us different types of bread, all very yummy and enjoyed thoroughly.  We were pretty much full from our meals and appetizer so we opted to get some dessert drinks as my girl got a wonderful Sherry Cream and I finished the evening off with a glass of the Couvosier VS.   Overall feeling...I would definitely come back to the place. I would love to try their happy hour or something else next. I hear their burger is quite amazing.  It's not as romantic as say the Grand Concourse, but perhaps due to the night being a special occasion and it pretty packed that could be the reason, but we were entertained with great food, and a great waiter and huge props for getting the flowers on the right table for reservations.  Happy eatings my fellow Yelpers! Yours Truely, The Shaw...",

From the first step in the door with the welcoming fireplace and soaring ceilings, to the soothing sage greens and wood, to the inlaid tables, to the professional and friendly service, to the exquisite food.  Five celebrated a special occasion together this afternoon....Eleven made it even more special.  We started off with the roasted beet, Belgian endive, Maytag blue cheese, hazelnut salad.  It was beautiful!  Gorgeous jewels of golden and ruby beets sprinkled with soft, salty and sharp bleu cheese, crisp, crunchy endive, sweet hazelnuts, lovely apples and a drizzle of molasses vinaigrette started us off beautifully.    Entrees....well, 4 out of 5 voted for the strip steak salad and all raved about the beef!  I opted for the lobster roll sans the roll, please.  Beautiful mesclun, which I understand was the first of the season and locally grown, was piled high with succulent chunks of Maine lobster dressed with a fresh lemony vinaigrette.  The lobster had been cooked perfectly...tender and sweet.  Absolutely heaven.  Oh!  And the housemade, fat dill pickle rocked.  Mmmmmhhhmmm.  On to dessert.  We were a little more diverse in dessert selection, but only marginally.  3 out of 5 ordered the molten lava cakes that were accompanied by hazelnut ice cream - housemade, of course!  All three wore happy little chocolate smiles the rest of the day.  Our 4th was all smiles over the apple crumble pie with roasted cinnamon ice cream and I....well, of course I had the creme brulee.  In this case it was pumpkin creme brulee.  Warm, toasty spices infused the lovely, soft custard with that gorgeous, crunch of bruleed sugar on top.  I do love a good creme brulee....this ranked right up there with the best.  A round of coffee and those adorable little macaroons brought to the table left us all happy as clams.  Delightful.",

It's more comfortable than the overly fussy dining room. Plus the tavern menu offers one of the best burgers in town, along with a rotating selection of other goodies. Staff has always been tremendously friendly & knowledgable, and it seems like they don't have a lot of turnover, which is a good sign.   Brunch is also great but the real treat is happy hour from 4-6pm. $6 top-shelf martinis and lots of little snacks.",

I have enjoyed the pumpkin squash soup, the beet salad, the crab cake sandwich, the pork huevos rancheros, and chicken sandwich served with the killer fries, just to name a few items. BJ has tried the New York strip and eggs, shrimp, leek, ham & cheddar omelet and loved every minute of it. We always swear that we are going to try the Eleven burger or the grilled sticky. But something else always manages to catch our eye. They also serve a bread basket with a yummy croissant and random tiny little muffins with an ever changing delicious homemade jam and flavored butter. Kudos to Eleven for serving up the best brunch in town!",

Food was fabulous, all local foods bought fresh daily, which is also why the menu changes daily. My business colleagues enjoyed their dishes very much.  Some of the favorites included mushroom soup, foie gras appetizer, lamb, seafood trio, scallops.  We each tried a different dessert. The banana cream pie is one of the best things I've tasted with amazing flavor of banana, caramel, and various textures achieved by incorporating small meringues, a caramel wafer which separated the banana custard from the caramelized bananas on top which were flambeed to perfection.  My second favorite dessert were the apple beignets whose fried, sugary outside crunched and then revealed a fluffy, doughy center which melted in my mouth with subtle flavor.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive.  Water was refilled promptly and each dish was timed, served at the right temperature and simultaneously to all diners in our party.",

Crab cake was very good, great spice, needed a sauce, a little dry and over cooked. Scallop delicious and perfect. Asparagus tasty, but too much lemon zest. Grits delicious and perfect. Harmonizes the dish and brings everything together.  LOL this sounds like an episode of Chopped :)  What brought this down was the bread. After reading the reviews I was expecting a wonderful bread option. it was extremely difficult to get the bread person to come to my table. She seemed to neglect me because I was dining alone. She would serve others and pass right by my table. It was really annoying because I was very hungry. The portion size was also very small, so more bread would have compensated. The piece she did bring was stale and cold. This was a major bummer, because I wasted carbs on some old bread. My high expectations and this lack luster bread course really brought the experience down for me.",

    "text": "As far as contemporary fine dining goes, Eleven sticks with the Big Burrito formula pretty closely. Nothing they serve is entirely challenging but for a lot of Pittsburghers, it probably appears that way.  Either way, there's no way to argue about the quality of the food. The ingredients are seasonal and local and the cooking is inspired. Eleven is probably the most upscale of the Big Burrito restaurants but the stuffiness that comes with that atmosphere is wholly missing.  I love being able to order food off a restaurant's menu and recognizing the name of the farms that supply their proteins.  The service at Eleven is exceptional and the food is great. A lot of people seem to have a problem with Big Burrito but I think they are wholly responsible for a lot of the fine dining scene in Pittsburgh. Mad Mex, as laid back and casual as it is, is a great way to introduce your palette to flavors that will lead you to bigger and much more challenging flavors. Eleven is Big Burrito's attempt at the prize at the end of that journey and I think for most people, it's sufficient.  For a more in-depth review you can read the article on my web site. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featinginpittsburgh.com%2F2011%2F02%2F02%2Feleven-brought-coma%2F&s=73e23276b08b97cbc182d40c52e2e0e73d0a5252c102abf1e35ff4f374fdf782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinginpittsburgh.com/2...</a>",

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon the place after walking through Pittsburgh for the day...sweaty and disgusting, we did feel a little out of place for the ambience.  Both being industry professionals, we were very pleased with the experience. Upon arrival, we asked if we could sit outside. The hosts were very accomodating and led us up to a private balcony overlooking the river. The breeze was delightful. The wine list was impressive and the cellar overlooks the restaurant. Very nice.  We opted to eat off both the bar menu and regular menu, creating our own tasting. We started with the housemade soft pretzels with beer-cheese fondue: Light and fluffy, not greasy. Maybe saying that these pretzels are better than the Philly Pretzel Factory is pushing it, but delicious nonetheless. My boyfriend had the foie, which had a chocolate cherry tart and strawberries. Borderline desert/savory: very interesting.  Second course: Strawberry gazpacho. Light, refreshing, delicate, tart. slivered cucumbers. Everything I could have asked for in a strawberry gazpacho. We also had  the soft shell crab sandwhich, which was good, but wished the buffalo sauce was an innovative as the rest of the meal.  Overall, good food, service and ambience. If we're ever in Pittsburgh, we'll be back and definitely reccomend it to our friends.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place a four or five but couldn't. I'll explain. First and what really killed this place for me was some bad mussels with my stripped bass. I could smell something fishy and it should have been assumed it was my bass since it tends to be fishy anyway. But the first thing I grabbed was mussel the was to soft, salty and brinny. I almost spit it out but for some sense of dignity which I regret I didn't. I don't blame anyone specific but my plate should never have come out of the kitchen of a nice restaurant that had slow service.   That one small thing is all I can think about after I left but I'll talk more about the rest my experience.   Food: I started off with a duck and endive salad that was seasoned very well but needed pepper which I never got because I was not asked how my meal was until late into my main course. But I digress. Salad was OK. My stripped bass sounded great on the menu. Without getting into the mussels again I wanted my dinner to be as good as it sounded but in the end was just bland. The house special hot sausage it came with tasted like plain chop meat and the rest followed down the same path.   Service: started off very helpful but after ordering I was more or less ignored. I made a point of taking off my plate all remaining mussels and moving them about a foot away which at and decent restaurant would have been seen as a subtle hint to ask if my meal was OK.   In the end this place has great reviews and I wanted to give it one but in the end it was really one bad mussel and poor service.",

Entering the place increased my expectations since the interior was great (even though from the dining area you could see the whole kitchen which in general I find it not good - even though many people think it is good)! However, soon after we sat on the table the bad things came up.  First of all the service was slow.  Secondly the quality of the food that you expect from such a place is the best.  However, I really think that it was among the worst foods I ever had in Pittsburgh.  We tried simple plates (chicken and pasta) and not only they were nothing special but they were also badly cooked (e.g., extremely salty).  The waiter did not even ask if we wanted cheese on the pasta! The only good and tasty think was the bread (I am a bread-lover)!  Of course the place is overpriced.  The average price for the entree is about 30-32$ (however I would not rate it more than a 10$ plate).    In conclusion the only good thing about the place is its interior.  I do not think I will ever go back to this restaurant, unless if I have to (e.g., a business dinner/lunch etc.).",

    "text": "I went to Eleven on Friday night for a late dinner and got some delicious food but rather bizarre service.   We made a reservation, but got there a bit earlier than expected, so we asked the hostess about getting a table overlooking the bar if one opened up, and went to go sit in the lounge to have a drink.   I had a delicious Red Ruby martini with pomegranate and blood orange, and the bf had a Pear-secco, which he enjoyed.   We didn't have to wait as long as expected, and were taken to a table on the upstairs patio. It was a nice night, but the space was pretty generic and there were open tables in the area we'd asked for, overlooking the bar, so we asked to be moved.   When we got to our new table and started perusing the menu, I noticed that the tasting menus weren't there, which I'd read about online. I finally asked about the tasting menu and the waitress said that they don't serve it on the patio, and asked if I'd like to see it. I did, and it was what I ended up ordering (the vegetarian one), but I felt the whole situation was weird and uncomfortable. I just wished the waitress talked a bit more about the food in general. She never talked about what was on the menu, told us about what was good or tried to elaborate beyond the most basic answers to questions we asked.   The bread server, on the other hand, told us all about the three different bread selections, the type of wheat used in each bread and what made them unique. It was more in line with what I was expecting from the waitress and left me thinking, \"someone needs to give this guy a promotion, stat.\"  The meal itself was very good. It started with a taste of grilled cheese from the chef, then I had an artichoke soup and mushrooms on toast. I then had a small bowl of fettuccine in an olive sauce, which was a bit too olivey for my tastes, and a delicious grilled mushroom on black rice. I had the wine pairings with the dishes, which I liked--and it ensured that my glass was always full--and I got the chocolate peanut butter pretzel for dessert, which was a bit crunchier than I was expecting, but tasty.   I'm sure our experience would have been different with another server and another host, and overall I was really pleased with the quality of the food and the thought put into the dishes, especially the vegetarian tasting menu.",

These were actually more filling than I thought with the potatoes.  I had the Black Bass, which was succulent with a well matched polenta.  For dessert, we shared the creme fraiche brulee.  This was little and flavorful.  The only issue was that top of the brulee was so caramelized that it was difficult break into small pieces.  However, this was the only flaw that I could find in the entire meal for the night.  This is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh to appease your inner foodie.",

For entrees, we all ordered something different - I had the fillet, and wowzer it was the size of my arm and  so delicious - an excellent cut of meat.

    "text": "Another success from Big Burrito.  This place is new American at its best (in Pittsburgh).  I went twice in a weekend (both celebrating graduation with different people).  The first time I ordered the beef carpaccio which was prepared perfectly, in fact, I've never had better.  My date ordered a lobster tail in risotto.  The lobster was cooked just barely enough to warm it--perfect.  She ordered it again on our second trip.  I then ordered the pork porterhouse which was perfectly cooked to a medium rare, by the chef's suggestion.  She ordered the seafood tasting which consisted of scallop, rare-seared tuna, and a crabcake; all were perfect.  On our second visit we brought two others, one a vegetarian.  The vegetarian ordered the seafood tasting menu and loved everything except the fried tofu course (a regular tasting menu is also available, along with wine pairings for both menus).  I ordered the antipasto which was excellent, however, I would not suggest anyone ordering it by themselves--Eleven should specify on the menu that the antipasto is meant for two because I don't see how one person could possibly eat that much meat, cheese, and pickled vegetables.  I then ordered the strip, perfectly cooked to rare.  It did not beat my experience with the pork porterhouse just a few nights prior though.  The experience around the table was all positive--the veal and lobster was well appreciated as was the roasted chicken.  The wine selection is extensive, as should be expected.  The desserts  are another shining feature of this place.  All are made to order (the molten chocolate cakes takes about 10-15 minutes from the time you order).  Unfortunately, this is not the best New American food I've had and honestly it is pricey (especially the wine), and hence Eleven takes a 4.  Regardless, this is about the best dining experience in Pittsburgh.  Bottom line--if you need to celebrate, impress a client, or impress a date, go here.",

    "text": "Went here with my fiance tonight for our Valentine's Day dinner. We booked our table via opentable, and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table once we got there.  We were seated upstairs in a small 'private' section with 4 other tables of two each. It was a nice quiet area to be seated at.  My fiance had the vegetarian Vday tasting menu, while I had the crab cake appetizer and the beef tenderloin with bone marrow for my main. The crab cake was disappointing - we often go to Monterey Bay on Mount Washington for what we think of as superb crab cakes - so this was really very underwhelming taste wise. Not sure what kind of crab was used here. Although, the presentation was great with fingerling potatoes and a delicious sauce. The beef tenderloin came very medium rare, and was very tasty. The dish as a whole was good, although the jus on the bone marrow was a bit too salty for me, and the cheese that was served with the dish did not really complement the other flavors of the dish as a whole. My fiance's tasting menu was great from the start. The sweet potato soup and the risotto were the best parts, but as a whole, all tasting portions very well presented and tasty.   For dessert, my fiance had the lemon cheesecake with his tasting menu and I had the spice cake. The spice cake was amazing! Not too sweet, and the ice cream and other elements went together perfectly! The cheesecake was also great - again not too sweet and overwhelming. Due to a mix up with our order by our server, we also got a 'free' black forest cake from the non-vegetarian tasting menu. It was also very good, but the best of all three was definitely the spice cake.  Our server was the only one serving our table in that area, while the other four tables were served by another server who was very passionate, enthusiastic and very professional. We wished we had him! Our server was bad right from the start - his demeanor and customer service was completely off - and he screwed up our dessert order and neglected us throughout the dinner. He also 'forgot' to have bread sent to us, and cleared my unfinished cocktail without asking. I do not want to say more as I don't think his service should be representative of the restaurant as a whole.   I want to give this place a 4 for the food and a 1 for the service (based on the server that we got tonight) but I will be fair and give him and the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.   So I guess, to summarize, great food that's worth a try, though I can't guarantee all choices will be perfect. Prices of food were standard for a restaurant like this, but the cocktails are more expensive than usual.",

The lobster was fresh and tasted like it was just caught that day. My Hanger Steak was very good also.  After we finished she was presented with their chocolate, peanut, pretzel candy bar. (brownie, peanut butter mousse, peanut brittle, pretzel and milk chocolate ice cream) It even had a piece of chocolate on top that said Happy Birthday!

Will definitely be back.",

Comfortable seating, unique 2 floor design with great tables for large or small parties.  Brunch offers up a $39 pre fixe menu which includes an appetizer, entree and alcoholic beverage. The Bloody Mary is perfectly spicy and I've had some great brunch meals here including oysters, vanilla waffles, omelettes, and a delicious sticky bun. Meal comes with fresh bread and butter/jam.  For the real experience though, you have to come for dinner. Expertly crafted cocktails, nice wine menu, and a decent beer list - although their beer selection could definitely use improvement. I've been here for special occasions almost a dozen times and haven't been disappointed. My go-to is the different iterations of the bone-in pork chop with varying sides.",

Our visit was fairly late on a Wednesday night but staff welcomed us warmly and worked together seamlessly to make our time there fun.  They have a really nice wine list, too (Yeah!)  Because it was fairly late, we ate lite.  I ordered the Kale Ceasar and as a huge fan of white anchovies, I wished that there were more than two but the salad was crisp and perfect.  My husband had the steak frites entree.  The steak was cooked to order and the fries were crispy and hot.   Such a lovely surprise as we wandered around downtown Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "This restaurant is probably the pride of the Pittsburgh natives.  From the surface, they have it all.  Cool vibe, dim lighting, open kitchen, sleek decor, specialty chef, etc.  It is definitely a more formal place and I would consider it \"Fine Dining\" so that is important you know that before you go.  It is the kind of place that doesn't have specials because the chef is constantly changing the menu to fit what is in season.  It is also the kind of place where a bread boy walks around with a basket of goodies and rations them out to each patron.  That's all fine and dandy but to some extent I just wanted him to leave the basket of bread and take a hike.  Moving on...Our server was annoying.  She was stalking our table and she didn't come across as sincere.  Hard to explain but she wouldn't just allow us to enjoy ourselves.  We had a 6pm reservation.  I mean it isn't like she was trying to turn our table....I think she was just bored.  When my husband made the reservation they asked him if it was a special occasion and he told them, yes...our 8th year anniversary.  Just a note to management...don't ask if you don't plan on acknowledging it.  We have been asked in the past but then brought out a little box of chocolates, given free desert, etc.  But here?  Nope.  We got hassled by the waitress.  I ordered the pike which was pretty good.  It was served with brussel sprouts and sauteed apples and all types of other colorful things around the perimeter of the plate.  It was good, not great.  Hubby ordered the salmon which is served just pan seared but raw on the inside.  He requested that it be cooked through to medium well.  Well, guess what?  It was pinker than a newborn baby.  He didn't enjoy it at all.  He told the waitress and she quickly offered to have it cooked through so we waited and it came back in crumbled pieces of cooked salmon.  It tasted much better but again, no apology from management.  That is just my pet peeve I guess.  We passed on dessert because none of them stood out to us.  We grabbed the check and left.   There are some good things about this place but they could use some fine tuning.",

Since I'd heard so much praise about Eleven, I decided to entrust it with my Sunday brunch experience. It didn't disappoint.  The prix-fixe brunch special that a lot of Big Burrito places seem to have--one appetizer, one entree, and one juice or cocktail for $25--is a great deal. For my appetizer, I had the goat cheese doughnuts. That sounds bizarre, I know, but the goat cheese is subtle, and gives the lil' rings a nice tanginess. I also tried my brother's appetizer of choice, the grilled sticky, which was like a hybrid of a cinnamon roll and French toast in caramel sauce. The bread basket Eleven served was also yummy, with biscuits, mini-muffins, and a croissant, plus house-made vanilla butter and raspberry preserves. I had the Ruby Red Greyhound as my cocktail, which was gin and grapefruit juice, and it was delicious.   That was a lot of carbs and sugar, so I sadly abstained from the vanilla bean waffle. The mushroom and red pepper omelet, however, was a fair enough consolation. We had absolutely no room for dessert.  The service was great, and the atmosphere of the place was really pleasant. Thanks, Big Burrito, for being so consistent with good service and food at your multiple restaurants.",

Eleven was one of the only places that didn't incite a storm of complaints.   We went for brunch and got the brunch prie-fixe options, each of us choosing a drink, appetizer, and entree.  From the fresh squeezed orange juice to the perfectly medium rare steak, the whole meal experience was amazing. They provided complimentary croissants and muffins, made fresh daily (which were amazing as well).  In terms of appetizers, I'd recommend the seafood or the hash. The salad is slightly unorthodox (for us anyway).  I think any of the entree options are great, though the steak and eggs came with a deep-fried poached egg, which was as amazing as it sounds.  The server was polite, the ambience was fancy, and the timing of each course was perfect - the entree was up in a timely manner after we all finished our appetizers (and every dish came out exactly at the same time).  So overall, A+ for everything. It wasn't even the most expensive brunch place you could go to, but it's one of the best places you could go.",

Regardless, there have been a bunch of conventions and shows in and out of town, so I made a reservation. It is recommended, but you could probably get away without, since they also have an upstairs floor.  For food, I started with the three sisters salad. The salad was a bigger portion that I expected, and it had just the right amount of dressing (and I don't usually like dressing on my salads). As my entree, I ordered the seafood combo. Oh man, was it delicious. It came with two perfectly cooked scallops, a round and fat crab cake patty, and a piece of salmon. I love seafood, so this dish was perfect for me. All of that was served on a bed of risotto that complimented the food very well. Last but not least, DESSERT! Even though I was stuffed, dessert deserves a separate stomach, so we ordered the candy bar and the orange (i think?) pudding cake. Both were delicious and highly recommended by our waitress.  Overall, the service was great. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu items, and I trusted her recommendations. The food was delicious, and the ambiance was nice. The food/drink is a little more pricey than what I would usually pay, but I would go again for a special occasion.",

They have a great brunch deal - any appetizer, main course and cocktail from their menu all for $25.  This also came with a complimentary bread basket which was a nice touch.  I decided on the bloody mary for my drink - now, I am normally a fan of some spice in my bloody mary's, but this was too much for even me!  I really enjoyed the muffin in the bread basket, and decided on the beignets for my app and eggs benedict for my main.  The beignets were very fresh and hot and the eggs benny was pretty good - I have had better and I found the ham/bacon on the bottom to be a little salty and was a little strong tasting.  This restaurant has great atmosphere and service though.  If I am in Pittsburgh again I will definitely put it on my list for a dinner place.  Also, I think that it is normally pretty pricey for dinner, so I really recommend it to anyone as an upscale brunch spot but without the price tag.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. The first few months after I moved up here, my boyfriend and I were regulars in their bar. Once a week we would hit the bar, try out a few drinks, and order a crap ton of appetizers.  Before I discovered Meat & Potatoes wonderfulness, Eleven was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their bartenders are awesome and the food is just to die for. It is so. damn. good. Based on last summer season's menu, we had tried every appetizer they have and a few entrees. I am just a big fan of samples lol so I love ordering a bunch of different apps.   Out of all of Big Burrito's restaurants I think Eleven is the best (though I have not eaten at Umi - yet). They make the best cucumber martini my boyfriend said he's ever had. And their Leven-ade is super delicious. For food, you HAVE to try the roasted chicken entree if you have not yet. It makes me want to hug my own face, it's so good. The skin is crispy, the meat is juicy and tender, and the risotto once was really good. The other time it was crunchy.  When it's a nice day and they have the big windows open - omg, do I love it. We used to hang out there for hours. We haven't been back recently, but something tells me the food is still spot on.",

    "text": "Have been here several times and have nothing negative to say. From the pre-dinner cocktails to the cheese plate with port for dessert, the Eleven experience is certainly one that you can make memorable. I know a lot of people complain about the prices, but this is fine dining. Not Primanti's. You are coming here, one hopes, to enjoy the best quality food and beverage the area has to offer. And for the unrefined palate, some of the dishes may seem off putting. Foie gras scares a lot of people when the find out what it is. What they need to learn is that it's delicious!  Especially if you happen to be there when the chef has prepared it torchon.  If you have money to spend, order what you like and ask the sommelier to pair the wines for you as you go. Yes, it's pricey, and the wine is served in a full portion, not tasting portions. So maybe Uber into town if you are going to do that. If not, just try the suggested chef's tasting menu with pairings. It is a great deal for what you get.     The service here is wonderful. I've never had an ill interaction with the staff here. They are attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, and respectful from the time you enter the door to the time you leave.   We have been here for several special occasions and plan to keep coming back for more!",

    "text": "I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. I reserved the Chef's Table, which means the chef prepared a 9-course meal customized for us based on our like/dislikes, and we sat next to the kitchen so that he could present each of the dishes to us. We also had each dish paired with wine.  I did not give them a whole lot to work with during the interview. I told them that we eat a lot of seafood, but also enjoy vegetarian dishes as well as red meat dishes (so essentially I was saying we eat everything). I said that I strongly dislike bananas (which might sound weird, but I really cannot stand the taste/smell/texture of them).  I also said that we are willing to try anything once, and the chef should just have some fun and bring out some of his favorite dishes. I have always been impressed with the food here, but this time in particular I was blown away.  We started by taking advantage of their gin selection and ordered some gin and tonics. We later realized this was unnecessary and that there would be more than enough wine to go around, but we didn't realize how generously poured their pairings would be.  The nine courses included oysters, scallops, halibut, oxtail, fois gras, lamb, and 2 desserts. Each of the dishes came with some unique toppings that were combined to create some sensation flavor pairings. For example, the scallops (my favorite dish) were served with heirloom tomatoes, lardo (cured strips of pork fat), and tarragon, all over smoked corn grits. The foie gras (my boyfriend's favorite) was served over zucchini bread with fig, blackberry, and red wine vinegar. I could have never dreamed up these combinations, but I am so glad that our chef could!  The meal was not cheap, but it was well-worth the price and was a great way to celebrate the special occasion.",

Food: 5 stars   My boyfriend and I started out with the Grilled Peaches and the Yellow tail Sashimi. The Grilled Peaches were heaven. The combination of the goat cheese, peaches, Serrano ham and a balsamic reduction: Wow!   For our entrees - I ordered the Halibut. It was cocked perfectly and the cream corn complimented it wonderfully. My boyfriend got the lamb. It was just like lamb should be - rare to medium rare and tender.   For desert we had the Peach Marscapone Cannoli. I have to say this is probably one of the best cannoli's I have ever had.   This restaurant really highlighted the fruit that was in season and did a wonderful job. A highly satisfying meal.

I really think we found the best (and maybe ONLY) classy brunch place in the city.  (we are from Philly...).  What a very cool space!  The ambiance was airy, open, and yet every table had a private feeling.  Our server was excellent, and I couldn't believe what a great value!  In Philly or DC or NYC this brunch would have been well over $300.  They have this Prix Fixe brunch menu for $25 where you get a brunch cocktail, an appetizer, and an entree.  Yes Please!  I had the spicy bloody mary with pickled veggies, nice and spicy, and I LOVED that there was a pickled carrot in my glass!  Cool!  The mimosas were also delicious.  My appetizer was the oysters, nice and fresh, with a unique Eleven recipe hot sauce to accompany them, habanero/mango sauce.  I was surprised how well it complimented the oysters, which were fresh and delicious.    My entree was the Eggs Benedict with a truffled hollandaise sauce.  I think they made the english muffins in house, they were AMAZING...and they used two whole muffins! It was served with a citrus salad, fresh oranges and grapefruit with mint, it was SO refreshing and a perfect way to cleanse the palate after brunch.  And finally, the grilled sticky.  This amazing dish requires its own review really... HUGE slices of brioche, like over two inches thick, grilled and glazed with a bacon butterscotch drizzle over the top. WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW.  We ordered two for the table, on top of everything else, because that's how good it was. WOW.    I don't know when I\"ll be back in Pittsburgh, but I'd love to try out the dinner menu here!",

    "text": "I have never been so angry after eating at a restaurant. This is my first yelp review since 2009 but I had to start with this place, our experience was just awful.   We arrived at 8:45 WITH a reservation. The place was half empty yet we were sat in a back room on the second floor with two other couples. There was no music and the tvs were off so it was fairly awkward. The rest of the restaurant looked trendy, but this room seemed like just a place to have staff meetings. We asked to be moved to one of the five open two-tops we could see in the main room below but we were told that they were already reserved. Only one had been filled by the time we left at 10:00.    The server was completely clueless about anything on the menu which is surprising for a place this expensive ($200 for two people). He was unable to answer basic questions about the food and drink menu. The service in general was terrible, when we left the hostesses just started at us and didn't say a word, and the two valet guys did the same as they watched us try to hail a cab.   The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the lamb loin chop which was ok but very small, definitely not worth $38. My girlfriend got the prime strip steak which was not good. The menu said that it came with pickled peppers, but a $45 steak that tastes completely like pickles? Are you serious? Also, it came pre-sliced which was a bit of a surprise as well.   The waiter recommended the tasting menu yet when we ordered the first course a la carte he informed us they were all out. Why would he even suggest something if it wasn't even available? We got the oysters instead which were great, but they were raw; thats more of a testament to the quality of the oysters than to the chef.  Overall the food was terrible and the service was even worse. I would recommend avoiding this place at all costs. $200 down the drain. Definitely will never come back here.",

I was intrigued by their vegetarian tasting menu, but it fell flat, along with their regular tasting menu and a la carte dishes.  I came here with my husband and two other Pittsburgh family members that we see a few times a year.  The tasting menus (vegetarian and regular) were blah.  Good but not great, and definitely not worth the price.  The a la carte choices were more well received, but probably because they were less expensive.  When our check came, we were definitely not impressed.  We could have had a much better meal for our money.  BIg Burrito - this is an embarrassment for you!",

However, my boyfriends steak was cooked rare when he had asked for it medium. He couldn't even eat the middle of the steak it was so rare (I don't mind rare, but when you order it one way it should come that way). Besides that the food was top notch. For dessert he got creme brulee, and I got the peach crostata (both were very very good!).   As for the service, we sat with empty glasses for at least 20 minutes, and bread was never offered to us. We also sat with finished plates for a long time waiting to hear about dessert. It was not even that busy at the time we were there, so not sure about that.

I love the urban, upscale feel of the restaurant. It isn't pretentious, and everything from the decor to the flatware is tasteful and elegant. My husband and I most recently came here to celebrate our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed.  I started with a glass a of the pinot blanc/pinot gris blend from Alsace (one of my favorite regions for white wines in the entire universe), and it was delicious. They had a good wine list, which is one of my favorite things about Eleven.  I started with the tuna tartare, which was delicious. It kept with tradition, while still being inventive and fresh. I loved the caviar on top! I had the seafood tasting this time around because I was feeling indecisive, and it was lovely to be able to try a little bit of several things. The portion size was perfectly adequate for me, but then, I don't like feeling overly stuffed when I leave a restaurant. The salmon was cooked well (there is nothing worse than overcooked salmon), and the scallop and crabcake were delicious. My husband had the pork chop, and the glazed beets in the dish were outstanding.  Next time, I look forward to exploring some of Eleven's cocktails options as well as more of the menu items.",

    "text": "Ho-lee SCHNIEKIES.  I went to Eleven on a Saturday night during a weekend visit to Pittsburgh. I'd read the menu and it sounded terrific, so I decided to give it a shot. AND I took my 11 & 9 year-old kids with me (they're adventurous sorts, they are).  Often, I can tell how a dining experience is going to go based on how my kids are greeted. I take them to a lot of \"foodie\" places and if they're welcomed with smiles, which they certainly were at Eleven, that's usually a good sign.  We were seated upstairs, near the bar, at a relaxed table with soft lighting. Terrific atmosphere, very nice, but casual--there was no air of pretense here at all, though again, everything was very nice.  We started with drinks, and I had the restaurant's signature Moscow Mule. They make it with house-made ginger beer that REALLY has a great bite (I'm super-picky about such things and hate it when ginger beer is too sweet) and cucumber vodka. The pairing was PERFECT. A lovely cocktail ... we were off to the races.  Then, friends, there was the food. I started with roasted pumpkin & potato soup that was crowned with homemade pumpkin seed granola. On an evening when the weather was raw, biting, and damp, this was more than welcome. Warm, creamy, and just a bit spicy, it was the perfect beginning to the meal.  Dinner was magnificent. My son had the roasted chicken, which was moist & tender (he said it was one of the best things he'd ever eaten and told me that it was so good, his head might well explode--this is a compliment of the highest order when you're 11). His meal was complemented by risotto, wilted Swiss chard, and all was served in a shallow pool of thyme jus.  My daughter, not to be outdone, got the Walleye Pike, which was pan-seared (absolutely tender and perfectly cooked) and served on wild rice, with dried cranberries, pecans, pea tendrils, and toasted chili puree, with cider saffron beurre blanc (and yeah, she ate the WHOLE thing). It was wonderful.  I had the beet salad, which was lovely with goat cheese vinaigrette and baby kale, but the coup de grace were the sea scallops, which are easily among the better things I've ever eaten. Two monster-sized sea scallops were wrapped in potato (I have no idea what evil genius thought this up, but DUDE) and served in a delicious bed of tasso ham, Sea Island red peas, and smoked onions. Holy CATS. So good.  I'm a fan of Big Burrito's restaurants, in general, but MAN! This was an experience I'll not soon forget. I might even drive up to Pittsburgh again soon just to have dinner here.  Just extraordinary. Oh! And the service was top-notch, too.",

    "text": "*Sunday brunch review*  The $25 price fixe brunch is a great deal!  For the price, you get a cocktail, an appetizer, and a main course.  I had a mimosa which was just perfect, the right ratio of OJ to champagne.  For my appetizer, I got the Three Greens salad (because I figured I should eat some veggies before gourging on what was to come...), which actually was wonderful.  I could have eaten just that and been satisfied for a normal lunch.  They also brought us a complimentary bread basket full of mini goodies like biscuits, muffins and croissants.  I had a mini biscuit with honey butter and it was delicious.  I wish it had been warm, but otherwise it was a perfect texture.  For my main course I had the shrimp and scallion omelet which came with bacon (they make it themselves! awesome) and potatoes.  The BACON....O.M.G.  It had a pepper rub on the edges and it was very meaty.  It could have been a tad crispier but I think that's because it was so thick.  It was so good and the dish came with THREE pieces which I ate all of (snort, snort...I'm a little piggie!).  The omelet itself was wonderful as well, but I could have eaten just bacon and the delicious side of potatoes and been happy.  The service was really good, too.  I was impressed.  Although I would note that there's no reason to take away perfectly unused silverware between courses...I support being green and not re-washing clean silverware for no reason.  Anyway, this was by far the best food I had in Pittsburgh.  I am glad we didn't go for dinner because of the recent \"meh\" reviews and considering the price, I would have been sad if it wasn't amazing.  But for brunch...it's a great deal and some awesome food.  Very impressed!!",

It was delish! Well made, great service by a beautiful bartender.  Let me point out the lunch was perfect for a one hour lunch break. Plus this place is just so clean and just a neat setup. Yes it's a tad expensive. I think it's worth the stop. ;)",

My date and I shared the ricotta cavatelli and tuna tartar to start, both were delicious and exceeded our expectations. A member of the front of the house brought a basket of bread to choose from, it was difficult to only chose one. For dinner my date had the halibut with polenta, the consistency of the polenta was next to divine, I could have made a meal of that alone. The texture and flavors and the way they intertwined has made me crave it ever since. Dessert was amazing as well, sorbet and creme brulee. Only 4 stars as I had to send back my martini 2xs as it wasn't made properly. The first one was delicious but the following one tasted of hair spray. All in all an amazing atmosphere and impeccable dishes.",

We had dinner reservations for 7 but arrived a half n hr early and were seated right away. Our watress was very polite and knowledgeable. We started off with some cocktails. I had Eleven Mules and it might have been the most refreshing, delicious mule I've had. For our entrees, My boyfriend had the eleysian farm lamb cooked med-rare..AMAZING. I had the seafood tasting with my salmon cooked med-rare and it was perfect. The scallops were so good that I wished it came with more than 1. But the meal itself was the perfect size portion. For dessert we decided to go with the white chocolate panna cotte which was recommended by our watress. We were not disappointed!  :) Can't wait to go back!",

I found a few of the dishes slightly salty for my palate.  We had the roasted chicken and the scallops.  They were perfectly cooked and paired well with the white wine we had.    The service was the kicker here though.  Despite excellent food we found the service quite slow, particularly for a lunch spot.  It took 15 min before we could order and another 15 minutes after we were done before we could ask for our check.  We only had an hour for lunch and had hoped to have dessert as well.  Our food was brought rather promptly after we ordered, and I believe took less time than getting a waiter to take our order :)    Give yourself time if you go here for lunch.",

The spring salad - I could've eaten as a meal.  At my table we had chicken with risotto, hangar steak with asparagus, and salmon with fresh vegetables.   All were large portions and enjoyable. Dessert was a trio of sweets: chocolate peanut butter graham cracker, bananas over a cookie, and pound cake - at that point we went from satiated to uncomfortably full.  We were eating on the outside balcony.  The view was beautiful.  As the sun set, the manager was very prompt to lower the blinds to shade us.  The wait staff tried hard to meet the requests of the guests. Another waiter would have expedited beverage requests.  Utilize valet parking ($6) rather than dealing with the parking lot across the street ($5).  $10 for a mediocre mojito ... $8 for a beer ... ugh",

We also split a three greens salad. (We didn't want to fill up too much before our main course.) The cavatelli was the ultimate comfort food. There was something familiar in the tase, but also original in flavor. It was the perfect combination of nostalgia and inventiveness. (This meal is vegetarian fyi.) I sampled my husband's steak and it was amazing. Best steak I ever sampled! For dessert, we ordered the \"candy bar\", a delicious chocolate cake with a peanut butter frosting, served with chocolate ice cream. They personalized it, with \"Happy Anniversary\" written with chocolate icing on a piece of white chocolate. The food was awesome and the service was equally outstanding. We will definitely be coming back!",

Prior to coming we checked open table to see if we should make a reservation. There were all times available so I didn't think it should be an issue. When we arrived the hostess would not seat us at an actual table and said there was \"plenty of self seating in the bar\". There wasn't. We had to squeeze in at the bar and it was less than ideal. I don't understand why she wouldn't seat us when there were plenty of available reservations like I said and looking at the actual dining room plenty of open tables. Anyway, the food itself was really great. We had the steak and eggs and the breakfast sandwich. I might be back provided I can actually be seated next time.",

    "text": "All-around great restaurant!  My wife and I were in town for a weekend from DC so we came for brunch on Sunday.  We utilized their valet parking service for $6 because alternative parking was $12 due to an event at the convention center.  The valet attendant and hostess were both inviting and we were seated at a large booth that was among other diners, but also allowed us to have a private conversation.  The server was attentive and genuinely wanted us to have a good experience.  They had a prix fixe brunch menu that included a starter, entree, and brunch cocktail for $29.  It seemed like a good deal on the surface, and based on the quality and portion size it was well worth it!  We shared one prix fixe meal and ordered an ala carte starter to share.  We had a moscow mule that was tart and delicious.  For starters, we had the avocado toast and short rib hash, both were excellent.  The actual toast for the avocado toast was a dense bread that may have been a bit too dense, but the overall dish was still very good.  We shared the Eleven burger for the entree and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The veal pattie was tender and juicy and the bacon was perfectly cooked.  One detail that I liked was that they served the pickle spear on a piece of lettuce so the juice didn't spread across the plate and make the bottom of the bun soggy!  Another testament to their hospitality was when we asked the food runner for a second plate so we could share the burger, she offered to take it back to the kitchen and cut it for us.  It was nice that I didn't have to deal with butchering the burger in an attempt to cut it in half; they simply whisked it away and it came back on two plates with half a burger and half the fries on each plate.  The service, food, and ambiance were all outstanding at this restaurant and I strongly recommend dining here!",

We started out with an appetizer of spicy tuna tartare with drinks from their specialty cocktail menu. My husband had their manhattan and I had their Moscow Mule which i switched out the vodka for hendricks gin with no problem. Both drinks and the appetizer were delicious. We also experienced the bread person that comes around and the sea salt focaccia  is worth every single carb/calorie.  Our waiter, Brian I think was his name, did an excellent job spacing out our courses to finish our drinks and app/bread before our entrees were served. I had the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with mushrooms, asparagus, and tons of flavor. So delicious and melted in my mouth!!! My husband went for the seafood tasting. The crab cake was the largest I've seen with large chunks of crab, the scallop was perfectly medium rare and melted in your mouth like butter, there was also halibut and grits that were also excellent. We each had a house wine, chosen by our waiter,  that paired with our meal these were roughly $10-13/glass and both delicious! For dessert we each had creme brulee that came with fresh rasberries, a french macaroon, and a little chocolate badge with 'Happy Anniversary' on it. We each had a glass of champagne for toasting. :)   All in all an excellent experience. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful. I was told by a friend when I asked about dress code was that I would find people in jeans with heels all the way up to floor length gowns. This was actually very True as i saw both and everything in between.  We will definitely be back in the future!",

I attended with a party of 3, and our table was a little to big for us. If your party is between 2 and 5 people, prepare for an awkward seating arrangement. Furthermore, our waiter and busboy were both a little awkward,  and uninformed on some features of the menu. Not a huge issue, everyone at my table found their farces pretty funny anyway. These two are my only \"negative criticisms\" of the experience, if that.  We started with the crab cake and the sheep's milk gnudi. The crab cake was delectable, and far more crab than cake, which speaks to the high quality of the establishment. I usually don't like sheep's milk, but the gnudi was not too sour for me, and it's balsamic sauce complimented it very well. I had the Gerber Farms Chicken, which was absolutely delicious. The white meat of the chicken wholesome and juicy, and the meat from its leg was mixed into the risotto, the swiss chard functioned as a perfect counter to the heavy starch and protein. The bird was locally sourced from a farm in Ohio. Fresh is best! My girlfriend ordered the Red Snapper, and her mom ordered Swordfish. both tasty.  If you like chocolate, ORDER THE CANDY BAR. Beautiful plating and balance of chocolates, caramels and peanut butter. Perfect to share for 2 or 3, or have it to yourself if your'e brave enough.  Eleven is a great experience for a sit down meal, or bar vibe. I will be eating here a 3rd, if not 4th time in the future!",

    "text": "Eleven was our first dinner experience in the city, and for us, truly is as good as it gets!  The interior decor is classy yet not overly stuffy, and the lighting is flattering to everyone and everything.  As requested, we sat in a booth on the first floor.  There is a second floor that completely opens up to create an \"open air\" space weather permitting, but the weather was not permitting on the night of our visit.    For cocktails, my husband chose a scotch, and I chose a French Pinot Noir.  Much to my delight, the Pinot Noir was a generous pour, and I did not have to order a second.  As starters, I chose Ricotta Cavatelli (blistered cherry tomatoes, garlic, basil, burrata and tiny pasta) and my husband had the gazpacho.  Both were very good, but mine was the best!  We also enjoyed their bread basket with my favorite being the raisin pecan bread.  The entrees were Lamb Loin for me, and Beef Tendeloin for him.  They were fabulous as well as the other accompanying items--take a look at their menu.  I cannot do it justice, other than to say I wanted to lick all my plates clean!  Although we had more than enough food, we had to keep the winning streak going and try dessert.  My husband ordered banana dream, I mean cream pie, and I ordered the trio of sorbets.  The pie looked like a dream pie, and had I not eaten so much, I would have wanted my own piece.  My sorbets were flavored watermelon-strawberry, cocunut-lime, and passion fruit served with a side of fresh berries and 3 small delicious cookies.  This was the best sorbet I have ever tasted.  Flavors were on the sweet-sour side, and reminded me of margaritas, sans tequila.  And we both had a shot of their house made limoncello --totally hit the spot!    Service is excellent, and their timing is down to a science.  Our server was quite attentive yet not intrusive. Never did we not have a new set of clean silverware for each course, and there were plenty of bread basket visits, and drinks filled.  Wish we were in town longer as I definitely would like to come back for happy hours and to dine on the second floor open air style.",

This is what I want 'American' cuisine to taste like.  The dishes we had were all superbly executed - cheeseboard, steak tartare, swordfish with forbidden rice risotto, ricotta cavatelli, 'Candy Bar' desert. Truly enjoyable from start to finish. Oh, the in-house breads (semolina, cranberry and focaccia) were as good as the dishes. The atmosphere was amazing and the service on point.

The service was excellent attentive but not over bearing. We were seated where there were tables for two in a row and I didn't feel like we were on top of the tables next to us. The noise level was good too. The menu was varied too, it seems like so many pgh restaurants are meat heavy lately ...many great options at Eleven",

They offer valet parking for $5.00 but my son showed me on Penn Ave you can park your car for free after 6 pm and we were only a couple of blocks away!  We were seated immediately upstairs with a view overlooking the bar. Eleven does have an outdoor patio as well as Tavern downstairs with a separate menu. Dress is business casual.  We had a new waitress serve us and she did an excellent job. We learned that we could \"swap out\" the sides that came with our entrees. With that in mind I ordered the wild Alaskan halibut but chose the sides that came with seared salmon entree. My son also ordered the halibut and my daughter opted for the roasted chicken.  We were given a choice of three different types of bread prior to our meal. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and made sure our waters were filled as well as any other beverages we ordered.  The main entrees are generally small but there is enough with the sides to give you a delicious meal. All meals were pretty well seasoned but very good. We each decided to opt for a different dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It came with banana slices on it as well as cookies and caramel slices.  My son had the ice cream sandwich that had real cheesecake in it. My daughter had the chocolate cake which came with peppermint ice cream and chocolate candy.  We were given peanut butter crunch truffles with our check. Service and food were excellent. This place is pricey however, I do not mind paying a bit extra now and then when a special occasion warrants it.  Eleven is open for lunch during weekdays only but open for dinner nightly starting at 5. This is truly one place we will visit again when the occasion warrants it.",

    "text": "A spur of the moment trip to Eleven turned into one of the best meals we've had in Pittsburgh.   I've heard of Eleven in passing and have read a few reviews on Yelp, but we'd never made our way down there until last night. Glad we did!  I had a reservation for 6:45 and we were promptly seated, we sat on the second level. I myself really enjoyed the conversion from warehouse to restaurant. The work done in the building is exceptional in and of itself.  We both looked over the drink menu, I opted for a Victory Festbier and she opted for the Starry Night cocktail. While I myself am not a fan of cocktails, I sampled the Starry Night and it was exceptional, the garnish of sage absolutely put it over the top. I could smell it from across the table.  Being as we'd never been, we of course had to try a little bit of everything. We ordered 3 cheeses to start; Uplands Pleasant Ridge Reserve, Chickabiddy and the Goldette Tommette. The cheese plate was served with breads, honeycomb, walnuts(a few were a little bitter due to over roasting) a cracker of some variety and an unidentifiable delicious jam.  Next I opted to have the Three Green Salad. Initially at first I wasn't enjoying it, it required a bit more vinegar in the vinaigrette. However once I discovered the red pepper goat cheese on the bottom of the plate along with the caper berries it all came together. She had the Sweet Potato Puree which was delicious. I don't like sweet potato but upon trying it..maybe I do! I'd also like to point out that the Sweet Potato Puree was piping hot.   Entree time. She opted for the Seafood Tasting and I the Elysian Field Lamb Loin. Our food arrived promptly and was very hot. The plates of food were both very attractive to look at and the plating was nice. My lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare. Seasoned adequately. The side with the patty pan squash, the wax beans, green beans and the Israeli couscous was very nice. I liked the peppery seasoning which the sides had. The raisins and pickeled onions just put it over the top.  She enjoyed the Seafood Tasting however made a point that the crab cake was mediocre at best. However, the scallop and the halibut were very good. The halibut was cooked perfectly. The sides which accompanied the seafood tasting were nice as well.   For dessert I had the Cashew Blondie Sundae and and she had the Blueberry Pie. The cashew brittle on the sundae was absolutely awesome. Crunchy, sweet and salty at the same time. The blueberries in the blueberry pie tasted as if they'd been picked yesterday. Very fresh tasting.   The entire experience was excellent. Great food, great service and a great environment.",

My girlfriend and I also ordered oysters for an appetizer and they were the freshest, most real piece of seafood we had ever tasted. It is almost like they had just taken them out of the ocean and put them directly on our plates. The sauces served with them were also savory.

    "text": "This past Sunday I took my mother here for brunch and we had an amazing time! Eleven's Prix Fixe menu included an appetizer, an entree, and a free cocktail or juice for $29. While we waited we enjoyed croissants, cornmeal muffins and biscuits with honey butter and pineapple jam that was utterly fantastic! I ordered the beignets that were served with a raspberry compote topped with granola and glaze, the polenta waffles that came served with *the* most amazing peppered bacon, and their sangria cocktail. The beignets were amazing and the waffles were very nice, if not a bit sweet (although, that was my bad for ordering two sweet dishes in a row *can't wait to go back and try the salmon salad*). My mother ordered the pistachio sticky bun and the prosciutto omelet breakfast that came served with potatoes and that peppered bacon again. Both dishes I tried (with or without permission) and both were delicious! My only gripe would be the cocktails. My sangria and my mother's mimosa were both made with *very* dry wines - not our bag, but definitely not a deal breaker. Out of everything, what we enjoyed most were the portions. While the food was lovely it wasn't sparse, proving that fine dining can be beautiful, delicious, *and* filling! After seeing the value of Eleven's brunch menu, both my mother and myself are eager to return for dinner!",

I got the oysters (you get six pieces), proscuitto omelette, and maple smash.  With the oysters, you get this awesome hot sauce, which I asked for on the side with my omelette since it was so good.  With the proscuitto omelet, you get a side of either bacon or sausage.  For their cocktails, they use top shelf liquor, bulleit for the maple smash.  Excellent brunch spot and I hear dinner here is great as well.",

There's valet parking in the front. The restaurant inside always makes me feel like I'm in the Great Gatsby era--it's dark and there are amazing lights and the seats are so plush. But the real standout, and the reason I keep coming back is the food. Everything that I've had, from seafood, to steak, to pork chops, has been amazing. They also circle the tables with different bread options that are to die for.   The desserts are good too! Everything is good. Go make a reservation now.",

The couches, bar, and high-top tables were all open. I had two of the sangrias on the happy hour menu; not only were they delicious but they were beautiful! I also decided to try the calamari which was super tasty. I'm usually not one to get calamari, but when I return, I will definitely get it again. I paid just $7 for the calamari and each of my drinks. One of my friends tried the Soft Pretzels, and the other ordered the Blue Bay Mussels which both ended with clean plates/bowls. I love the calm and chic atmosphere this restaurant provides. I'm excited to return bringing more people and trying different dishes on the menu.",

    "text": "Eleven was finally the first restaurant through my Pittsburg adventure with a quieter setting. We thought we'd splurge a little on our last meal yet it was still pretty affordable.   Food: the food was definitely more elevated than the few other spots we hit up while on our trip. For $30 we got an appetizer, entree and a drink. We started with the Eleven Mule which was cucumber vodka and some ginger beer, very refreshing. They gave us a basket with assorted baked starters which was a little bit on the dry side. When the main course came it was definitely delicious and the perfect portion. The breakfast sandwich (which I asked to be all separated) was delicious, especially the bacon!   Service: We asked for everything to be served at once and boy did it come at an incredible speed. Waiters were all very nice   Atmosphere: Finally a place where we could just have a normal conversation without screaming. I mean with the decor and vibe of the place you definitely wouldn't find the louder crowd here. I'd recommend this for brunch, a nice business meal or romantic dinner for sure.",

Recently went with some friends to celebrate getting a new job. As always, the food was out of this world. The beef tenderloin was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. We also got the cheese board for the table and it was really good. The waiter was good and attentive enough, just not very personable.   I can't remember the wine I had, was fairly good. The food is always worth it but the wine sometimes is hit or miss for the high prices.   Overall, very good experience though. There was 4 of us and everyone was very happy and full by the end of the night. (Have also been here for brunch and it was excellent!) Can't wait to go back!",

I NEVER LEAVE 1 STAR REVIEWS!  My friend decided he wanted the Eleven burger which he has had before. We were getting takeout and so he called and it went to the bar. Kind gentleman (I won't say names) answered and proceeded to take the order. When he was asked what kind of cheese he decided he wanted 2 kinds of cheese. The gentleman said he thought that would be a really \"sloppy\" burger for takeout if they would put 2 kinds of cheese. Eh ok appreciate the concern but we would like 2 cheeses (really not a huge change). So after a back and forth of him saying that he just didn't think it was a good idea and us continuously asking, I suggested to tell him to put one cheese on the side to solve the issue. He then said well I'm not sure we can do that. What? We aren't calling Wendy's. This is a $15 burger. So my friend repeated with \"you can't just give me the other cheese on the side?\" and then he said \"well this will be an upcharge\" and he replied with \"that's fine can you tell me how much\" and the gentleman said he didn't know. OK FINE you work at the bar I get that (however you can order all food at the bar) but you can't just look at the computer and see what extra cheese is going to cost? By the end my friend just ended up saying \"Ok, how about I just call back\" and immediately the guy says \"oh no i mean we can do all that for you\" but we just said no thanks and ended the call.   Literally all we wanted was 2 kinds of cheese and we would have paid for it. I usually don't get dramatic and say \"I won't be back\" but I don't know if I will this time. They've taken a good amount of my money, and this was just a very sour moment.",

Coincidental name/timing aside, we were promptly taken upstairs to our table for two in a narrow dining section overlooking the bar. We immediately noticed and remarked about the classy, yet industrial, feel of the entire restaurant, which is obviously intentional in such a large building on the south end of the Strip district.  In looking over the brunch menu, we rather easily decided on the Brunch Prix Fare, which included a choice of appetizer, entree and cocktail. We were both eyeing up the Grilled Sticky, a cinnamon swirl brioche with bacon butterscotch and icing, as well as the Eggs Benedict and a mimosa.   However, our awesome waiter recommended only getting one Sticky because it was easily large enough to share. We took his advice and substituted the Grilled Salmon instead. Thank God, because he was absolutely right! As delicious as the sweet monster was, we barely finished the entire thing together. The sliced salmon with mini everything bagels and cream cheese complimented it very well and the delicious Eggs Benedict topped off the entire brunch rather nicely.  For only $25 a person, the excellent food and service was well worth a Sunday morning visit. On a scale of one to ten, I'd say it's a...well, you know.",

I also had half a dozen oysters as well. The place itself is bog with dark wood and nice lighting. It looks really expensive, but the prices aren't too bad. The oysters were nice and clean, and my cocktail while needing to be stronger had a nice taste to it. They have regular seating, and also some couches as well. We opted for the couch.

    "text": "On a scale from 1-10 - this is an Eleven (well maybe an 8 :-))   We had some really good food here.    I had an opportunity to select a place for a group dinner (8).    I chose Eleven based on the reviews and the groups 'likes\".     I am actually going to review two aspects of this place.  The Bar Area - Happy Hour   I really liked the bar area.    This is a very trendy place where they have plenty of seating and a more casual area tha looked very comfortable.    I could see myself meeting my folks just to sit around the bar.   The bartenders there were good mixologists.   The area was inviting and with good conversation that gave you the feeling you were at a party.  Maybe this evening was different but I really liked it and give it a high mark (especially after I sampled some of the appetizers.  The Restaurant  We were escorted upstaris when our table was ready.   I made our reservation on Open Table thru Yelp for 4:45 PM (after work dinner) - the restaurant had limited openings.    We were not rushed and was seated around 5:15 after several cocktails (see bar review above :-)).  A couple of things you must be prepared for...   They have great appetizers but according to others in my group - they have great bread.    This place has servers walk around with large baskets of various types of bread.    Our poor bread guy visited our table so many times - I am surpised he just did not leave the basket.   I believe there 6-8 varieties.  Appetizers Really good Oysters.     We had several appetizers but I remember the Oysters.   They were fresh and the sauces that accompanied were very good.   (We actually had 2 orders)  Food: I ordered the duck wanting to do something different.    The duck was not greasy and cooked perfectly (I actually asked for the Chef to cook my meal to his recommendation to maximize the flavor)   It was accompanied with white bean medley.    It was awesome.  Desert - I know chocolate lovers will go with the chocoloat - but the Lemon-Blueberry Cake is awesome...  It is light and great with coffee.  I highly recommend you save room :-)  I give this restaurant high marks.    There was one issue that hurt the review a little.  Two individuals in my group ordered the same meals (steak) but at different temperatures (Med Well vs Med Rare) ...   Unfortunately - the mixed them up and this caused a delay because one took a bite into his meal.  (not really a big deal - it was handled very gracefully but we had a couple of folks waiting for food)  Drinks - Around the $5-7 range Appetizers - $6-15 - Yummy Dinners - $25 average - Yummy  All and all a good night.",

I'm not talking about \"it had the best combination of toppings,\" I'm talking about \"it was melt in your mouth tender.\"   Their wine selection is phenomenal. I've been here twice and gotten a glass of the reisling both times. I went with others who got sav blanc and a Malbec and both were enjoyed as well.  So there are two sides of the restaurant. There is the tavern side and the \"normal\" side. We have eaten on the tavern side both times as the other side is a bit more fancy ( both in atmosphere and menu). Service is great. They come around and offer you slices of three types of bread (varies daily) and butter. Our waters were always refilled and our servers were very attentive.   I'll be back!",

Everything about this restaurant is outstanding-  the ambiance is very sophisticated and  wonderful, the service is educated, informed, efficient, unobtrusive and helpful. We have dinned here numerous times for business and for pleasure. We have had outstanding lamb, veal, pastas and seafood.  Chef Stevens never disappoints and when we get the tasting menu and often we do it with the wine pairing it is a dining adventure. Sometimes we ask the chef to add an extra course to the tasting menu and he always obliges with something superb.  I should mention that the deserts are amazing. The experience is EXCITING AND WONDERFUL.",

    "text": "Eleven tries really hard, but ultimately very little that I ate there succeeded. The menu and ingredients look exciting, but the person preparing the food and creating the recipes doesn't seem to have a chefs idea of what goes together well/how it should be cooked and seasoned. I've never written a dish-by-dish break down of my meal before, but I feel like like Eleven warrants one, so here goes:  First, someone comes around with a bread basket. This bread basket turned out to be the highlight of the meal, and there was a cherry poppyseed bread that was excellent. After this, we started with the tuna tartar, which was also good - however, there was a raw oyster, out of its shell, on top of it, which was a sign of the weird choices to come. What were we supposed to do with this oyster? You're not going to chew it with the tartar, but slurping a dry, raw oyster from a fork instead of a shell also seems strange. I love raw oysters, and really all raw seafood, but one just lying over tartar is kind of unappetizing. I also got a kale Caesar, which had really good dressing, but too much of it, WAY too much Parmesan, and an insane amount of pepper - again, good ingredients, but not quite right.  Then came the entrees. The entrees are where this slips into a two star review. The entrees took beautiful ingredients and made them tasteless, which makes me sad. I had pasta with shrimp and uni - I think uni is the most magical thing in the world, and it needs to be treated very, very lightly. I couldn't even taste this uni, at all, because it was drowned in butter. The sauce for the dish, from what I could tell, was simply a stick of butter, Paula Dean style. It was bad.   My boyfriend got the grilled swordfish, which, again, had great ingredients - but when you see fish with chorizo on a menu, you kind of assume it will be lightly sprinkled with chorizo, not served atop a sausage cake almost as big as the fish. The fish was flavorless and cooked to death, but it wouldn't have mattered if it wasn't, because the chorizo cake totally overpowered it. The shellfish with this dish were tough.  All in all, the menu reads like someplace really exciting, but the people in the kitchen just don't seem to get how to meld flavors together, and every dish just seems like a waste of beautiful ingredients. The meal actually made me a bit depressed - definitely disappointing.",

That day, the basket included 2 mini banana muffins, 2 mini blueberry muffins, 2 medium sized croissants (large enough to split in half), 4 cornbread biscuits, and fresh butter and berry jam. The bread was super good and very filling! Would have been nice if they had warmed the basket a bit before giving it to us, but still delicious.   For food, our group shared appetizers: Grilled sticky ($11) - huge, perfect for sharing between 4 people; the bacon was subtle but perfectly accented the cinnamon swirl brioche. Our table's favorite dish!  Beignets with meyer lemon curd ($9) - There were 4 beignets on the plate and were plated on top of the meyer lemon curd, yummy.   We each ordered individual entrees: Eleven burger, medium rare, with goat cheese - good, but a bit dry; fries were excellent! With all the appetizers we had before, I only got through half of my burger and took the other half to go. Not the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh, but delicious.  Eggs benedict - My friends said this was just okay, probably would skip this  Would return to try lunch or dinner or to have the grilled sticky and bread basket again.",

It's kind of a passed-over location at the edge of the Strip close to downtown, but that doesn't seem to diminish its popularity. And it makes for a quick walk from a lot of hotels.  For a solo meal at the bar, this was a pleasant place. Long list of spirits, with a mix of the generic and considerably better options. The Eleven burger is a truly excessive concoction of burger, braised veal, bacon, onions, goat cheese, and a bun that managed to hold all that together without overwhelming the thing with starch. Awesome.  I'd like to come back for a real meal, but why do that when there's the option of having a scotch and burger at the bar?",

    "text": "I went to Eleven tonight with a group of nine friends to celebrate a buddy's birthday. One of the most pleasing things about Eleven is the leisurely pace of your meal. You are given ample time to survey the menu and the wine list, chat with your party, and of course, to enjoy your meal. To me, this is something that sets Eleven apart as an experience to look forward to.   My friends weren't in much of an adventurous mood, so we ordered pretzels and pierogies off of the bar menu for appetizers. The potato and cheese pierogi was tasty, but the pretzel was truly a treat- a salty, tasty gem that is unlike other pretzels you'd come across on similar bar menus. The cheese dip also had a unique, welcome tang to it.  For dinner, I went with roasted chicken served with sauteed Swiss chard and risotto. The chicken was delicious. The skin was crisped perfectly, and the chicken was quite moist. I'm not a huge fan of greens, but the Swiss chard was all right as a complement to the chicken and the creamy risotto. A little more sauce with the dish would have been nice, but overall, the dish was a winner.  My girlfriend and I shared a molten chocolate cake for dessert. The cake was rich and moist, but it was surpassed by the hazelnut ice cream and crisp chocolate wafers it came with. Next time, I will probably skip the cake and just go for the ice cream and chocolate wafers. Dessert was worth it for the crisp chocolate wafers alone (think a Nestle Crunch bar except about five times better).  Eleven is an outstanding place to celebrate a special occasion. The food and service are both excellent. A waiter or someone with an awesome bread basket never seem to be all that far away. Sooner or later, I will return. Hopefully, they'll have some more comfortable chairs upstairs by then...",

I went to Eleven with two friends to try their Sunday brunch--collectively, we tried: the grilled sticky, the scallops, the crabcake, the huevos ranchero, the eggs benedict, the Eleven burger, and the pumpkin mascarpone cannoli (with delicious pears).  Everything was unbelievably well-made. The ham included in the eggs benedict  makes me salivate to reminisce about; the tartar sauce on the crabcake was perfectly complimented by not only the crabcake itself, but the white anchovies served with it; the Eleven burger was MONSTROUS and well-worth the price (don't leave without trying it); and the dessert was more than a satisfying way to end the brunch. Along with some complimentary pastries with both a butter and an apple jelly as well as included drinks, I would be sorely mistaken to not give this place 5 stars on Yelp. The service was great, the food was great, and you'll see me here again (once I get the money to pay for an expensive brunch again)! Times like these make me upset to be a broke college student.",

I have had both the strip steak as well as the bass for an entree, the bass was okay but the steak was delicious, certainly what I will get when I go back next time.   Dessert is done well here, especially the chocolate molten cake, and the macaron that comes with the creme brulee is spectacular. The peanut butter candy bar sounds amazing, but truly is just above average. needs some more peanut butter.   Would highly recommend, especially for a nice occasion/business dinner.

I'd also like to add that this is based on lunch only.  I've never ventured here for dinner.  Let's start with what I love: their Riesling, the soup specials, and the sample cookie that comes with the bill (and well their desserts, in general).   I happen to love a creamy, pureed soup.  The fewer chunks in my soup, the better.  And they have some tasty pureed soups.   They do change them fairly frequently and last fall, they had a butternut squash soup that was excellent.   Also, with your bill, they always bring you out a mini-cookie.   I love this.   I get a sweet without feeling overly indulgent.  That's not to say that I haven't sampled their chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar, which is awesome.  What I don't love is the entrees on the lunch menu.  Since I don't eat any red meat, my sandwich options here are limited.  I hear they have one of the best burgers in Pgh but not my cup of tea.   The lobster roll is good but not great and I'd say the same with the crab cake.  Some of the lunch meals seem so large and heavy and I just wish they would offer a lighter vegetarian fare.   Would a gourmet grill cheese be out of the question?!  I'm perfectly content to order the soup and the three greens salad when going here but sometimes that just gets old.   More options, please!",

Strange, occasionally over-effusive, service once seated for a late dinner.  Excellent food.  I had the tuna tartare and the pork chop.  Excellent salt caramels, as always.",

I just celebrated my birthday there and they went to great lengths to make it wonderful: impeccable service, delectable food and drink, and lovely ambiance, even giving us our own small dining room off the main dining area. If you have an occasion to celebrate or are looking for the perfect Sunday brunch, Eleven is the place!",

    "text": "Very underwhelming experience. We ordered the tasting with wine pairing and a few appetizers to start. The tuna tartare had a mush-like texture and was flavorless. The yellowtail sashimi unfortunately was not much better. As for the tasting, not one of the dishes were memorable or worth the price we paid for them. The dessert was probably the best part of the tasting. Overall not bad service but the food was certainly disappointing.",

    "text": "Came back to Eleven for a work dinner and left very impressed.  The happy hour drink specials were excellent and service in the bar area was much improved from my previous visit to this establishment.  I was able to enjoy a Ruby Red on the comfy couches while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive.  Once upstairs for dinner I ordered the tomato salad for an appetizer and the tenderloin for dinner.  Both dishes were exquisite.  Red, green, yellow, purple tomatoes with just the right amount of dressing and garnishes.  The tomato salad was a hit with all 3 people that ordered it.  The tenderloin dish was also great.  The meat was cooked perfectly to order (medium well) and the juices still flowed clear and tastefully.  The bread selection that was brought around was also good!  I would certainly suggest it to folks who are looking for a higher end dining experience and I definitely plan to come back for happy hour.  For me personally as a dinner option the restaurant is priced beyond what I usually go for but a once in a while splurge does sound like a tasty treat.",

    "text": "Full review in Blog:  Calling the restaurant I was informed that the Chef's Table was generally for groups of 4-6, but if no one had booked it for a given night they'd be willing to seat a solo for the standard price of $100 for 9 courses - placing my reservation a couple weeks in advance I was glad to find out that Mondays were generally quiet and I'd have the table all to myself.  Somewhat disappointed as my only vantage point of the action in the kitchen was through a small slit in the tiles, I was promptly greeted one of two servers who provided the cocktail list and filled my water.  Professional and courteous I will note that service throughout the evening was mostly competent, albeit not overwhelming - a course was delivered without silverware, water reached empty twice, plate clearing was a touch slow.  Fortunately, as part of the Chef's Table experience I had the honor of receiving all of my dishes (and excellent descriptions of preparation and ingredient sourcing) from Chef Chad himself.  Shortly after the chef's departure the bread-lady arrived with a woven basket featuring three house-made breads.  Browsing the online list and realizing Eleven takes orders for breads and confections all I can say is that the bread basket gives me a good idea why - all three of the options were excellent.  From a sweet yet toothsome Currant Semolina Sourdough, to a rustic and aromatic Carraway Wheat, to a heavenly moist Sea Salt Focaccia each of the options was excellent...and while my primary server wasn't always on the ball, I was never for want when it came to bread.  The third course of the evening would provide the first \"wow\" of the tasting - an impressive accomplishment given the simplicity of the dish.  Served proudly and with great description by Chad the House Cured Prosciutto with Three Sisters Mesclun, Vin Cotto, Olive Oil was sublime - the nutty notes of the silky pork only enhanced by the slightly bitter greens, acidic yet sweet vin cotto, and smooth olive oil.  A new passion of the young chef I was even given the opportunity to see the curing area after my meal - a small section of the wine vault with meats aged anywhere from a week to nearly a year - a return visit for charcuterie at the  bar would certainly be on my agenda if I lived locally.  The final savory of the evening would be my favorite, as well.  Large in portion and bold in flavor, Elysian Field Farms Lamb - Sous Vide with Crispy Lamb Neck, Anson Mills Polenta, Golden Artichoke, and Mint was marvelous.  Nearly raw yet sizzling hot, the lamb itself was not as gamey as would be expected and the crispy wrapping of neck lent plenty of texture and savory flavor.  Acting as a bed to the butter-knife soft lamb was a chive laden and creamy polenta with the slightest hints of mint and mace.  Flanking the protein along with a savory lamb jus were crispy artichoke hearts - pan seared and creamy within, a vegetal composition not unlike the lamb in terms of presentation.  I was next greeted by the pastry chef who presented me a trifecta of her favorite desserts from the menu.  Titled on the menu as \"Tasting\" the trio contained miniature versions of Eleven's Famous Peanut Butter Pretzel Candy Bar, Banana Cream Pie with Tapioca, and Brioche Bread Pudding with Cinnamon and Strawberries.  While I will note I'd have preferred received all three as separate courses (time and temperature reasons only) I will also note that the lady has talent - each option was stunning.  Creamy peanut butter with chocolate ganache and salty pretzels, caramelized bananas with hand whipped cream and graham crackers...and oh the Bread Pudding.  With finger-thick slices of buttery brioche caramelized and doused in a salty cinnamon caramel reduction, the only thing that made it better was the ice cream, a smooth dollop of spicy cinnamon that melted slowly over the hot pudding.  Looking back on dinner at Eleven the word the two words that come to mind are \"American\" and \"Competent.\"  To be fair, in my experience I've never really had a tasting menu that I would call \"American\" without pronounced flourishes of French or Mediterranean - the Chef's table at Eleven was almost like going to CUT or a similar high end steak house and getting a tasting...the food varied from very good to excellent, but certainly did not re-invent the wheel.  For $100 the quality, presentation, and ingredients were certainly worth the price - but at the same time, I can't say I would rush back.  That said, Chad is an excellent Chef with a lot of potential and the space at Eleven is beautiful - I'd certainly go back for some a la carte selections and dessert anytime.",

    "text": "Rude pretentious host. As soon as my husband and I walked into the restaurant he looked at us from head to toe and back up again without making eye contact as if we were beneath him. Sat us at a table and handed us our menus with a limp hand and again without making eye contact then walks away with his nose up in the air. After reading other reviews I see this is a problem with others as well. I have no idea how he still has his job insofar as he is one of the first people you see when entering this establishment. Our food was amazing and our waiter was great. In the middle of our dinner, the pretentious host decides to straighten out the table next to us for no apparent reason and bent over and basically stuck his ass in our faces. Maybe to steal my husband? Lol I have no idea.  Unfortunately, I would never come back here again after being treated like shit from the tall male host.",

    "text": "My friend got drunk on his birthday and kept repeating \"I want lobster!\" over and over, so the next day I decided to take him out for a lobster lunch. I couldn't bring myself to go to Red Lobster so we came here.  Since Eleven was the only Big Burrito restaurant I hadn't tried, I was pretty pumped. We came with one of our friends who was coincidentally celebrating a new job, and were so overtaken by the sheer classiness of the establishment (the lounge area is baller) that we had no choice but to go all out. No mind that we looked extremely out of context in our ultra-casual attire and I'm pretty sure some suit lunchers may have thought my boys were serial killers--we were here to be fancy, goddamnit! Martinis, bloody marys, a round of oysters, tuna tartare, and goat cheese ravioli to start. The tuna tartare was topped with anchovies and caviar and had a nice lemonyness--probably the best tuna tartare I've ever had, though I'd like more caviar (I'd always like more caviar, duh). Ravioli were a bit dry, but tasty nonetheless.  After apps, I got a BLT. My friends got a chicken sandwich and a veal burger (yeahhh...the lobster didn't even happen). The BLT was pretty good with a juicy green heirloom, thick crunchy bacon, and a bright aioli. But I kinda make a better one at home, and I wasn't a big fan of the accompanying fries (too thick and soft for me). My friends said their sandwiches were amaze and they looked it.  The bill for me and the birthday boy (2 drinks, 2 apps, 6 oysters, and 2 sandwiches) came to $81 pre-tip. Which for a lunch is, in a word, exorbitant. While the food was really, really good, I would personally put it toward the bottom of Big Burrito's offerings. I prefer Soba and Kaya, which are both more affordable, and if I'm gonna spend the big bucks, I'd rather go to Uni. At the same time, I don't think it would be fair to give it any less than 4 stars just because BBG has raised the bar so high, and I liked it enough that I'd visit again for dinner.  Update: I came back for brunch, and it passed the test! Total steal at $25 for a cocktail, appetizer, entree, and basket of pastries. And ridiculously huge portions (the flatbread was so filling, I literally had two bites of my cavatelli and had to eat the rest for dinner that night). Again, it still doesn't beat my favorite Big Burrito brunch (that would be Casbah), but I'm still a fan.",
