My sashimi was as fresh as possible, which is the most critical requirement (in the East End, one must carefully avoid some other sushi stops).  My son ordered the basic sushi platter, so we didn't give Chaya the chance to show off it's creativity, but his sushi was fresh and well prepared. The dining area is very comfortable as well.  PS - it is BYOB.  We stopped at East End Brewing first for a growler of beer, and the crisp waitstaff at Chaya had beer glasses on our table within seconds after we were seated!",

In my last visit, I got a toro (nigiri) and was quite disappointed. It was a thin slice of not so fresh toro for the same price that I paid for a fat piece of toro at an upscale place in DC. Really Chaya? Other than that, it is good. Highly recommend staying away from the \"fancy\" rolls. Devote the space in your tummy for the simpler stuff. Chaya does that really really well.

The sushi was good - not spectacular.  The nice thing is that  the rolls were cheaper and smaller in portion size so you could sample a few.  I also liked the selection of nigiri.   The attitude there - from the menu warnings to the inclusion of a  tip calculator with your bill is really weird.  When you open the menu, you are confronted with a list of about 7 or 8 rules of engagement.  These range from a refusal to split a check to a line that says they occasionally at their discretion add in a 17% service charge (not table occupancy related).  There were quite a few of these and it seem like an awful lot for a place that only seats about 25.  It's BYOB, yet they charge $2 for every wine or beer glass and then an extra $3 for chilling or ice.  They didn't open our wine but just left a bottle opener at the table.  The restaurant was fairly empty, yet all the prime booths and the Sushi bar seats were demarcated as \"reserved\".  We were the last people there and nobody ever came to claim the special seating.  They remained set and reserved until about 30 minutes before closing when they cleaned them off while we were eating.  The restaurant is almost eerily quiet except for the occasional whispering among the wait staff. It seems like you aren't assigned any particular server as they all hover around your table waiting for you to want something.  When they aren't  doing this, they huddle in the corners and whisper to each other.  It's distracting with the lack of music.  Really weird place.  The final strangeness was that the bill is proffered in your typical black check book that contains a list of tip calculations in fluorescent green.  For a place that seems to average about $70 for two people with tip, I don't think the weirdness is worth it.",

It's extremely small inside so make sure you go in small groups.  They are also very picky about your entire group being there before you are seated.  The service is quick and friendly and the waitresses will make suggestions for you if for some reason you can't decide between two rolls that look equally amazing :)  The rolls are all very consistently good and the fish is always extremely fresh.  The menu is very traditional - there are a few rolls that have a bunch of different ingredients but it's not a \"fusion-sushi\" type of place that seems to be getting popular.  The sushi is very affordable, especially for the quality.  Now if only I still lived right around the corner...",

The menu was varied and interesting, and the sashimi was delicious, fresh, and perfectly cut. I got the larger plate of sashimi and it was very generously portioned.  It's expensive, yes, but I expect that with good quality fish outside of the west coast. I will be returning for special meals--it's a little too pricey to be my every week sushi joint.  Other comments about the wait time were accurate--definitely go early and have the whole party there.  The BYOB policy is annoying. We just decided to forego wine or sake rather than deal with paying to use a glass. In my opinion, places should either charge a corkage fee or be BYOB only--not do both.  Edited: Went back a second time with the parents and was not disappointed. Great sushi rolls! Simple ones tasted really good. The shrimp tempura was also excellent. The chicken katsu was so-so, so I recommend sticking to fish. This place is a little difficult for the non sushi-lover or non fish-lover, but I really enjoy it.",

    "text": "I agree with Chuck S.   Chaya is absolutely the best Japanese restaurant that I've found in Pittsburgh.  The place is really small and cozy so that it doesn't feel like you're in a chain restaurant.  The service is excellent, quick and friendly.    Oh, and the sushi is amazing.  The amount of rice that the chef uses is perfectly balanced with the size of the fish.  It's not a bloated rice ball with a small piece of fish.  The rice was perfectly packed so that it was solid, but airy enough to come apart easily when you bit into the nigiri sushi.  The rice was not too vinegary as I've found in a lot of the sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh.   Also, the menu is quite authentic and has many choices that you wouldn't see at the majority of restaurants in Pittsburgh.  They have onigiri balls, nabemono and much more.    Expect to wait a bit if you go at peak times.  It is a small place that has about 8 tables and a sushi bar that fits 4 people.  However, it is definitely worth the wait.  Also, the BYOB is great allowing you to bring in your favorite beverage.  Corkage is $2 per glass for wine and beer I believe.    Prices are very reasonable.  For two people, it cost me about $50 with the tax included.  We were able to get the deluxe sushi dinner and the sashimi dinner combo.  The dinner combos came with your choice of edamame or fried chicken (common bar food in Tokyo) plus salad and tsukemono.  You would be paying the same prices at another sushi restaurant on Walnut or in the Waterfront and the fish is not as fresh or delicious.",

After reading Yelp reviews, I was excited at the prospect of good sushi within walking distance from my new apartment, so I went for a sushi dinner with a friend.  I will grant the enthusiastic reviewers that the sushi at Chaya is better and more Japanese than the Chinese-run sushi restaurant around the corner.  It is, however, still mediocre sushi: no flavor, a bit dry, completely unmemorable.  I even disliked their unagi rolls, and if you've read any of my other sushi restaurant reviews, you'll understand what a blow that was.    On the upside, the restaurant is pleasantly decorated and the service is fast and friendly.  Their miso soup was also quite good.  Perhaps their non-sushi entrees are better?",

The service is hit or miss, but in general good.  I think most of my problem encounters have been when I have ordered to go.    The sushi is smazing, my personal fave - the spicy tuna hand roll.  And the prices are fairly reasonable.  I've had a lot on the menu, and can't say there is anything that I wouldn't recommend.  One of the major highlights of the sushi experience here is the freshly grated horseradish/wasabi.  It makes the experience totally different from the expected wasabi paste.  Please, just don't do what my mom did - not believing me in how the wasabi should be used (dip your sushi into the soy sauce that add some freshly grated horseradish onto your piece of suchi), she did what she normally does with wasabi - dumped it into her vat of soy sauce.  NOT a good idea - it washes out the flavor and don't expect the good stuff when asking for more wasabi.  They'll take one look, shake their head internally, and give you the cheap paste the next time round.    Enjoy!!!!",

On occasion, though, when I read another review extolling its virtues, I'd contemplate going back. It'd be awfully convenient to have a neighborhood sushi place.    Tonight I returned to the familiar cozy little dining room once more. Almost everything is as I remembered (the price went up, but I shouldn't begrudge them for keeping up with inflation). The best thing about the meal is still the fried chicken that comes with the dinner set.   Unfortunately, the negative aspects also are as I remembered.  The salad dressing is overly watery, and the sushi combo is still a let-down. The selection is pretty run-of-the-mill sushi fare: tuna, salmon, shrimp, some roes, and eel. The cut ought to be fresh, as it is purportedly flown in, but the taste was just not there. The fatty tuna pieces did not have that melt in your mouth feel nor did they have that suculant sweet taste. Instead, they looked a bit dried out and tasted bland.   Overall, I was disappointed. I would have liked to return to the days when I had a reliable neighborhood sushi joint. Well, perhaps in another three years, I'll give Chaya another shot.",

The other sushi restaurants are owned by Koreans, Chinese, etc. Does it make a difference? Hell yes.  I used to eat here at least once a week when I lived in Pittsburgh. The sushi is spectacular and fresh, but like any fresh ingredient, there were some occasions where I was disappointed with the quality. But only because it wasn't the BEST tasting on THAT particular day.   The wasabi is homemade unlike most restaurants that use a powder mix. Compared to other sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh, they have a greater selection of fresh fish including, Fatty Tuna (Toro) and live Uni if you're into that.  Don't worry, it doesn't wiggle. Instead, they crack open the sea urchin shell to reveal the yellow...uh, I dunno. I don't care for Uni.  The restaurant is super small and cozy which also means long wait times, particularly on weekends. You sometimes get the evil eye from the staff on those busy days, basically indicating that you should leave now so others can sit.   If your idea of sushi is fancy rolls and sauce, then I'd recommend Nakama instead. If you're into real sushi, I'd definitely come check this place out.",

As for the maki, the fish seemed quite fresh and the menu has a nice variety of cooked, vegetarian, and raw rolls.  However, the inside-out rolls had a rather thick layer of rice relative to filling and the rice did not completely cover the nori, which detracted from the aesthetic.  That might sound overly picky but part of the appeal of sushi is in its presentation. The vegetable tempura and the Murray Avenue rolls were especially good, but the Squirrel Hill roll was unremarkable.    I'd definitely come here again given the price--$17 after tax and tip for 3 good-sized rolls is a great deal, but if you're looking for perfectly executed sushi, this isn't the place.",

Before your meal, the appetizer they give you is three pieces of fried chicken. IT IS SO GOOD. Cool appetizer (:  I definitely recommend anything from their sushi / sashimi menu. It's always real fresh and well made. Get the sushi and sashimi combination. 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 california rolls, 7 pieces of sushi, 2 pieces of crab meat equals one satisfied and full customer!  Their donkatsu is also so good! Get it when you're super hungry because they give you so much!   Seriously, everything about this place is so good. The tempura, the udon soup, even their salad! Their ginger dressing is so good.  Everyone go. Worth the money.",

    "text": "So we went to Chaya for the first time this evening around 7:30...and by the time we left, there was a line out the door (literally)!  The atmosphere is very authentic, although I'm wondering how many people run into each other with the door AND the curtain for the entrance (really, do ya need both?).  The food tasted alright....and was presented on very pretty authentic looking plactes.  I wouldn't say this was the best food that I've ever had, but I also wouldn't say that it was terrible.  A lot of their dishes came with a side of fried chicken...is that really Japanese?  I honestly don't know, but it wasn't bad.  By the end of the night, the staff, consisting of four women, were literally running around...my guess is that they're not used to a crowd?  The service wasn't great or personable, but just like the food, it was just okay.  All in all, it was decent enough, but it's not a very convenient location, parking is a hassle, and there was nothing that'll cause me to really want to go there again (although if I ended up there, I'd be okay with that too).",

I don't see how you can be disappointed in Chaya, unless you were expecting something other than what it is. I do wish they had a liquor license, but BYOB is actually more affordable. Speaking of, Chaya is surprisingly reasonably priced.",

The prices are a tad expensive, and the quality of the seafood does not reach the standards of coastal cities, but there is nowhere else in a radius of 5 km where you can experience sushi of this quality. The deluxe chirashi for example is loaded full of fresh fish that was mostly satisfactory although the ikura was a bit oddly colored and suspicious in texture. I'm not sure if it ought to command the price of $35 but it satisfied a deep craving for quality seafood that I had been harboring for days.",

Tonight I gave it one last shot with a carry-out order for visiting family when I didn't have time to travel to my preferred sushi destinations in Shadyside or on the South Side. Big mistake. They had a single sushi chef for the house. My promised 25-minute wait (absurdly long to begin with) became nearly 40 minutes. This store has so much potential, beginning with the location, but it's pretty clear the owners are willing to skimp (including on the wasabi portion). It would be tolerable if the product were special but it just isn't.",

There were 5 or 6 on my plate and they were huge and oh so good. They tasted fresh and were excellently fried. My wife got the sashimi variety platter which looked and tasted fantastic.

Most other Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh have servers that don't speak the language.  They do have rolls at Chaya if thats what you are looking for... Generally, when I ate out in Japan the sushi was one ingredient sushi so that's what I am used to.

Knowing fully that wherever I go, nothing will fulfill my pretentious standards from my summers in San Francisco, I still attempt to remain open to whatever options this city might offer. And so, I've tried it all, from the egregiously overpriced option in Station Square, to the fishy (pun!) deals in South Oakland, and everything in between (including the all-you-can-eat turned all-you-can-poop travesty along 51).  Chaya was, in my opinion, pretty alright. I got the chirashi--the fish was good, the rice was tasty, the salad and soup were standard. Because lately I'm into lists, two things set Chaya apart from its competitors:  1. The wasabi is home-made. Yes, sweet Lord, yes. This delicious treat does not come from a tubed container, and it is recommended that you do not mix it in with the soy sauce. Rather, apply it directly to your sushi. Or, eat it plain like I did. It's delicious.  2. The management is warm and friendly and eager to refill your tea. I'm sure this experience may change depending on the night, but it definitely made our meal feel much more relaxed.  I'm not going to rave about this place (except for the wasabi), but it's worth trying.",

You can get the \"Trust Me\" tasting menu at Sugarfish, one of the country's best sushi restaurants. The preset menu includes an assortment of the BEST cuts of sushi fish direct from the market that very morning.

The restaurant is small, they were understaffed for a Friday night, and there was a long wait (over 40 minutes, and they don't take reservations unless they know you - that is, we were told they don't take reservations, yet while we were waiting, we did observe a reservation being seated, so the details are not clear).  Also, it was expensive for what it was.  The meal was not unpleasant, but for the price, the food quality was not up to par.  Another thing I'll mention is that for a restaurant as popular as this one, there is no excuse that they do not have a liquor license (it's BOYB), particularly when the food type being served is so well complimented by beer and/or sake.  In my opinion, they should spend a little bit more - hire another employee so they're not understaffed, get a wine and beer license, and buy fresher fish (or waste the old fish/rotate stock more frequently) to ultimately provide the customer with a higher quality experience.  They have these options, and chose not to do them.  I'm sure they make plenty of money, judging by what they charge and how busy they were, and it's our money that supports them as customers.  If you're willing to accept less quality, that's what you'll get, so my advice would be: just don't go there until they improve service and quality.     As a customer, I choose to demand a better product, and won't be back.  If it were cheap, it might have been worth it, but it's just a bad value.",

I don't know if it was just the night we went (a Wednesday night) or that we went kind of late (around 8:30) but this was literally the LEAST fresh fish I've ever seen used in sushi, in my life, ever. I can be pretty sensitive to smells/tastes, but my husband can eat just about anything. Still, even he didn't want to finish the salmon sushi/sashimi (which is usually our favorite). It was brown around the edges and had a very, very bad aftertaste that tasted how the Jersey Shore used to smell. I was legitimately worried we'd have food poisoning, because we did eat a few pieces due to hunger. Thankfully it seems we've avoided that, but needless to say, we will not be going back.   To try to end on a positive note, the food was not overly expensive and the waitresses were very nice. The restaurant looks okay on the inside as well. And, hmm... let's see... the green tea was great. But none of that makes up for serving old, rotten fish. :( I wanted to like this place SO BADLY. Oh well.",

I think it's Japanese owned, which is rare nowadays for a sushi restaurant, unless i've been fooled and its Korean or Chinese owned, but the sushi chef spoke Japanese as did the servers. The servers wear kimonos too which is cute.   The meals (soup, chicken kaarage, salad, tempura, and main entree - noodles or sushi) are great, and they come with alot of food. It's a little pricy, but you get good quality with it.",

Anyway, I got a tofu appetizer, 4 rolls and several pieces to share with another person and I don't remember our check being too bad! For how much we ordered, we got pretty full and satisfied. However, I remember feeling underwhelmed by the size and quality if fish. Also, the rolls didn't arrive at our table in the best form; the presentation was okay. They gave very little ginger, and they only had regular soy sauce vs. less sodium sauce. But I think I was craving sushi so bad I didn't really care.  I will most likely go again because it's really close to where I live and it satisfies the craving so...",

Gyoza: these were the highlight of the meal. Fried on one side steamed on the other, and the dumpling sauce was great.  Tuna Poke: where's the sesame oil? And the pieces were mush, like they were left over cuts. I dipped it in the leftover dumpling sauce for flavor.   Sushi & Rolls: tuna belly is normally the highlight of a sushi dinner out and we got excited when the waitress came with the plate and a blow torch in hand. Unfortunately she proceeded to over cook the belly. Further, it did not have the melty quality that it should, and the rice below fell apart in our fingers. That was actually a theme of the dishes we had: crap sushi rice. I mean, seriously, Whole Foods makes better sushi rice than this place. Tastier rolls too. We got a double salmon roll that actually had a fishy taste. And the yellowtail was chewy and stringy. Tuna avocado was surrounded by an overly thick layer of flavorless and crumbly rice. Ick.   We left extremely disappointed.",

    "text": "After nearly 4 years I've finally ventured out to Chaya.  What took me so long?  I'm always mildly hesitant about seafood when I'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving.  Three of us ordered a roll combination platter to split as well as our own food.  I ordered yellowtail cheeks, my friend ordered eel, and my last friend is boring.  First came the salad.  It was pretty standard, but any sign of vegetation is a good thing for the college male.  Next up was their karaage.  Ohmygoodness it was the best karaage I have ever had.  Now I've never had karaage in Japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and I was scared it would be a letdown.  The flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over.  Drool.  Miso soup was also pretty standard.  The roll combination was a disappointment.  Yes, we had it coming for ordering a platter of rolls, but it was only b/c the sushi/sashimi platters would have either been too big (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's).  In retrospect we should have just ordered a la carte Nigiri...  I noticed halfway through the meal they had Anago available that night too...  My yellowtail cheeks were delicious.  Personally I love fish cheeks (as well as the part of fish right by the tail when I order fish whole).  It's super tender and rich and tastes so delicate.  My end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly.  I would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the roll combination and I had picked up a piece of Toro and a piece of Anago instead.  Service was excellent and the their timing was impeccable; they have it all down to an art.  The next time I'm back I completely want to try their Omakase.  In Japanese it means \"It's up to you\" with \"you\" being the chef.  I was slightly disappointed when I saw my companions throw their wasabi into soy sauce and completely mix it up.  That is not how sushi should be eaten.....",

On my way through Squirrel Hill I'd passed Chaya several times, but as I'm usually there in the early afternoon and Chaya is dinner-only, I'd never had the opportunity to try their fare.   Most of the time I check websites before going somewhere, to get a feel of their menu and pricing, but this time I failed to do so. As soon as we were seated I picked up the menu and was a bit startled at the pricing. It's expensive, though not outrageous for quality sushi. I just felt bad that I'd dragged my boyfriend somewhere that was a bit too expensive for us at the moment, him being in school and me having lost my job to downsizing a few months ago. Still, we stayed put and decided to have dinner. I was impressed with the fact that they provided chopstick rests and a bottle of shichimi on each table.   Chaya's menu is standard sushi and classic Japanese. It's comfort food made with an eye for quality and detail. When not ordering a la carte, your meal includes an excellent mixed salad (mesclun greens, perhaps) with ginger dressing, a bowl of rich, heavy miso and three pieces of Japanese-style fried chicken thigh. By the time our entrees arrived I was already slightly full.   We ordered the sushi roll plate (salmon roll, tuna roll, California roll and an eel hand roll) and the negimaki. The California roll, usually the General Tso's of sushi, was excellent, as were the two other rolls and hand roll. Everything was plated nicely. The negimaki was perfect and the portion was decent, the beef and onions on a hot plate atop a bed of sprouts and garnished with broccoli.   This isn't the place I would direct people to if they aren't willing to pay for quality and atmosphere. It's a bit on the pricy side, and there are plenty of places in Pittsburgh that serve sushi at a much lower cost. However, the authenticity in both the food and arrangements is worth the price, even if I have to put it in the category of an occasional treat or celebration venue. Our meals, plus tip, were around $25-30 a piece, and we were choosing the less expensive options.  Alcohol is, apparently, BYOB only with appropriate corkage and glass fees.   Had I more disposable income, I'd have gone for the omakase. It's a shame I came to this place with so little cash.",

Usually, I go for the delicious rolls, but last night I opted for the Chirashi dinner (basically a bunch of sashimi on a bed of sticky rice). Yum!  The dinners come with soup, salad, and fried chicken! And all for around $20/person (that's without apps), so not too shabby as far as sushi goes. I plan on making many visits in the future.  Oh, they are apparently moving up the block (literally...just one block up the hill on Murray Ave), so if you don't see them at the original location, don't panic!",

So for my last meal on my Pittsburgh visit, I figured this spot would be perfect. It was just as good as I remember. Simply delicious. I had the Chirashi (this dish is always the True test of good Japanese food) meal with the salad and soup. The salad dressing was absolutely amazing. I drank the watery leftovers at the bottom of the bowl! The Chirashi was fresh and light, per the usual. I had a couple Toro Nigiris, as well. Actually, I had one, which was orgasmic, so I ordered a few more.   The food here is well prepared and presented. The fish is fresh - I saw the sushi chef cutting a fresh fish during my meal. The service is very polite and sweet. No complaints whatsoever. Give it a try!",

    "text": "SETTING: Probably the most authentic Japanese as you can get in Pittsburgh. From the get-go, I noticed the flower arrangements, the wooden tables and furniture, and the Japanese music lightly playing in the background. Chaya was beautiful and the establishment made quite the impression. The traditional decor and warm atmosphere was exactly what I needed to help me relax and enjoy some Japanese comfort food.   FOOD: We shared the Regular Sushi & Sashimi Combination. The course starts with a miso soup and small salad, then a small karaage (japanese fried chicken). Finally the platter comes out, an assortment of sashimi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, etc) and california rolls.   Miso soup and salad were pretty standard, as they should be. I love chicken karaage, so I was a bit disappointed that it was a bit small (four bite-sized pieces). That being said, they do a great job with creating a tender and juicy appetizer. The Sushi and Sashimi combo definitely featured fresh and good quality sashimi and sushi. Overall, it's not exactly filling if you're sharing between two hungry people, but is is a perfectly light dinner.   SERVICE: Kind and professional staff. They are very attentive and come by when every dish is served to ask how we like it and if we need more water. I believe all the waitresses and the sushi chef are Japanese as well, and they were very gentle and created a wonderful dining experience for us.  IMPRESSIONS: As much as my hungry stomach may disagree, particularly when it hijacks my mind's sound decision-making, I'm always about quality over quantity. Chaya is quality. Not just the food, but from top to bottom. The atmosphere, the staff, and of course, their dishes all create a remarkable casual dining experience.",

    "text": "Chaya is the place to go in Pittsburgh for authentic Japanese food. Upon entering the restaurant, I was instantly transported back to Japan. You know it's the real deal when the waitresses are wearing kimonos and the owner/sushi chef is chatting with patrons in Japanese. To further enhance the authenticity, they gave my friend and I warm toilettes to wipe our hands. Our waitress was so nice and did not rush us into deciding. My friend I decided on sharing the Deluxe Sushi and Sashimi combination. The course started off with a tasty Japanese salad with ginger dressing and miso soup (which was a tad underseasoned of miso). The next appetizer was Japanese styled fried chicken. Although the pieces were small, they were perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection. I highly recommend adding the lime that comes with it to further enhance the fried chicken.   When the star of the course came, I was excited. The presentation was very simple and divided the sushi by section. The platter included 6 pieces of maki, 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of California roll, and two pieces of different sized salmon roe. The type of fish offered were: salmon, tuna, fluke, shrimp, and yellowtail. I was very impressed by the freshness of the fish and the appropriateness of the thickness of the nigiri and sashimi.   I would give Chaya 5 out of 5 star for not the following two reasons. I didn't think that the California roll was made correctly with the rice around the seaweed paper being too thinly layered. My other reason is that I've had better (curse my food background in NYC). For Pittsburgh, this is definitely the place. My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I highly recommend getting a combination because the progression of the meal is an experience. When the sushi comes, it immediately grabs your attention even though it's not filled with fancy vegetables.",

I visited Chaya a whole lot in college, and when I was back in town for a few days it was at the top of my places to visit.  Something I should note here is that Chaya is not good for large groups.  They only have a few tables/booths that can fit more than 4 people and those can fill up, so either take a small group, go early, or be prepared for a potential wait.  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, and you can't get seated until your entire party is there.  I haven't had anything from Chaya that I haven't enjoyed.  When I started going here I actually didn't eat raw fish, and I really liked the tempura and the katsu dons (rice bowls).  Now that I have added sushi to my diet, I can also recommend Chaya's - the fish is fresh, the sushi is well-constructed, and this is one of the rare places that uses fresh wasabi.  If you're visiting with a friend or can convince one of the people in your party to split something, the sushi boat or the combination dinners with sushi and a soup are fine choices.  If you order the dinner set (which I recommend), entrees come with miso soup, salad and fried chicken.  Chaya was just as good as I remembered - outstanding food and friendly service.  I'll definitely try to eat here again the next time I'm back!",

This is among the top of my list as far as variety and quality. They have a huge nigiri menu, so definitely check it out if you're in the mood for fresh fish as I was.  The green tea - not the $.50 tea bags that other restaurants try to pass off. Good, authentic matcha powder in a delicate cup. Definitely recommended.  Areas of improvement:  Service could've been better. My cup of tea was refilled once, and the restaurant wasn't super packed.

    "text": "While having a not-so-great meal nearby in January, my friend mentioned that just around the corner, we could have had much better karaage and better food for a similar value. I just had to come the first chance I got, which unfortunately wasn't until ... 8 months later!  The restaurant is brightly lit (YAY!) and looks super traditional and Japanese, and so do the servers in their traditional clothing. Love the atmosphere.   The Chaya special combination dinners for 2 are absolutely the best value I've seen in the city. For ~$20 each, my friend and I sampled a variety of delicious food.  1. Salad. Delicious ginger dressing, fresh vegetables, well dressed. 2. Sushi - a 6-pc california roll to split and 4 pieces of assorted nigiri each, all fresh, good quality pieces. They weren't assembled very well (ie rice fell apart when picked up) and the vinegar was lacking, and the fish wasn't pressed properly, so they should probably hire a new sushi chef, but this is the best quality fish I've had in pittsburgh so far. 3. 3 pcs of karaage - absolutely perfectly marinated and fried, super flavorful and very juicy. Definitely lived up to their hype. They didn't come with sauce though... but they were good enough on their own. 4. The final soup took a while to come, but I was surprised our crab soup actually came with a whole snow crab (for the entire set for $40, I expected a few pieces of canned meat at best), and bunches of veggies and udon.   Service was great - very prompt and friendly, and patient with our indecisiveness.  We dug into our first bowls, sipped the delicious soup, only to find a hair wrapped around a tofu in the soup.... It wasn't a big deal, but they handled it amazingly and made me like the place a lot more.  For sushi, the individual pieces are a little pricey (though justified by the quality). But the service and atmosphere and the combination deals definitely make me a fan.",

    "text": "From my point of view, the food is not authentic Japanese. Japanese restaurant is famous for polite and good customer service and great well-made food. In Chaya, the price does not match the food quality, nor the customer service. Comparing to other non-fast food sushi restaurants, Chaya has no advantage but higher price.  About their customer service, my friends told me one time when they just finished eating, and just chatted a little while, the staff came to ask them to leave in order to save seats for other guests. I thought perhaps this was tolerable. When I was waiting with my friend during busy hours, I saw at least 3 tables were empty in about 25 minutes, but the waitress completely ignored us. After waiting for a while more, I had to ask the staff if we could seat  and they told us they need to clean the table, but I saw the tables had all been cleaned up already.",

The servers were dressed in full authentic kimono (most places don't take the time nor expense to also wear the obis), the bamboo and other decorations created a nice Asian environment.   There were so many polar reviews...seemed folks were either really happy or not. So I didn't really know what to expect. The sushi rolls were priced modestly, but they are for the smaller rolls versus the \"regular\" sized roll. The flavor was good and it hit the spot.  I am so glad we went and I will be going back when I return to Pittsburgh! It is so nice to have a decent Japanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill!",

We sampled a handful of apps, including their egg custard, various pickles, and soft shell crab.  The custard was solid, the soft shell crab was accompanied by an awesome dipping sauce, and the pickled vegetables were great!  We also went with the beef udon dinner entree.  Yes, it seemed a bit odd that it comes with pieces of fried chicken, but wow that's some unique fried chicken.  By the time we got to the udon, we were both approaching full, yet the first taste ensured we both made room to enjoy.",

They also have an assortment of otherwise-hard-to-find appetizers, which are solid, but I would recommend the sushi above anything else. I you get the seared tuna, you're in for quite a treat.",

The second thing you notice are the beautiful kimonos that the servers wear. I haven't been out to try anything new lately, and this was a wonderful experience to inspire my interest in \"trying new things\" again.   The food came out at a steady pace with appetizers and our main meals. Presentation is stunning on all accounts.   I'm a vegetarian so I ordered fried tofu, vegetable tempura roll, and avocado roll. My friends ordered beef udon, gyoza, regular sushi and sashimi, Edamame, and various other little things. Despite not eating meat, I could appreciate how beautifully prepared everything was. If you've ever watched a Studio Ghibli film, you know how absolutely perfect all of the food looks - from the steam rising from a soup to the crispy edges of fried chicken and the perfectly placed grains of rice on a sushi roll - our food was exactly like that. It was almost too pretty to eat!   Service was polite. The food is affordable. There's no fuss here. It's quality food, accessible from various bus lines and parts of the city, and an experience I look forward to having in the future.",

My bf had sushi deluxe including fat/lean tuna, salmon, sea urchin, eel, etc and it was huge! The food was a bit pricey but deserve the price (as they even charge for hot water...). Next time will try their matcha cheesecake and sukiyaki!",

I've been happy with all of the sushi rolls I've had, and have been told that the sashimi is also very good. The service in the restaurant is pleasant and the food is packaged well for takeout. Each roll I've had has been eight pieces and are reasonably sized and filling.   I would keep in mind that Chaya has weird hours and their regular entrees are pretty expensive. The appetizers and all of the sides are average price for things like a side of soup, or vegetable tempura.",

If this is important to you in a restaurant, then I strongly recommend getting over here. We started with their green tea, which I was happy to discover, is a \"bottomless\" green tea (i.e. you can get your cup refilled). Perfect on the chilly night we went.   The server was helpful in guiding us towards and away from items that are authentic but perhaps not to Western palates. However, my dinner partner and I were up for a challenge, so we tried the natto (fermented soybeans, a specialty in Japan that is not typically beloved by westerners). It was certainly an experience! My dinner buddy LOVED it, and I found it very interesting and pretty good.  Next, we had some salmon sushi, which was buttery, fresh and perfect. We tried the shrimp and egg pudding for two, which was a favorite of mine. The warm pudding mixed with the perfectly-tender shrimp was great.  We had a yellowtail cheek, roasted, which is a favorite of my dinner partner's. Even I was impressed by the melt-in-your-mouth roasted fish. For those who are not used to this particular dish, there is not a huge quantity of meat, but the meat you do get is known to be the best morsel of fish you will ever have! It was very good!  Prices were a little higher than some other places, but the quality and service were relatively commensurate with the higher price. I'll be back - and I certainly recommend this place.",

We ordered the fried chicken to start with, and it had a nice taste to it, and seemed to be freshly made. Adding a few drops of lemon juice on it made it seem more flavorful. Then the sushi came out and it was delicious! We tried the Avocado roll, Salmon roll and the tempura roll. It seemed to be very freshly made, and even the rice had a nice texture to it. The wasabi was just right, strong and fresh. The place is also BYOB so it works out cheaper and the fact that there are many liquor stores nearby, helps!

From the more traditional and intimate space to the nostalgic dress of the waitstaff, you almost forget you're still in Pittsburgh. Their menu is large, and depending on what you order it can easily come out to $30 or $70 per person. I personally found the fish to be tasty and fresh, and I did end up feeling pretty full from the Salmon Lovers combo. I do wonder if the Regular sushi or sashimi combos would have been enough, which are also not cheap but still a bit more affordable.   They have a ton of other things besides sushi, although most are still probably 50% more than I would like to pay for them. The hot pot, tempura, some of the noodles, and traditional combination dinners are probably good to get and better than your typical hibachi place. The salmon teriyaki was done nicely and was very flavorful. Finally, most entrees come with a small but very tasty and tender chicken karaage that's totally worth getting on its own.",

The Dinner comes with a cutlet, rice,  Kara-age Fried Chicken, soup and salad for $16-17. Perfect for sharing if you want to save some money.  One of my favorites is their Udon. The Nabeyaki Udon comes with two shrimp tempura that are nice and crispy. It's also full of vegetables (I think it might have been enoki mushrooms, Napa cabbage, shitake mushrooms, tong ho). The broth was wonderful and the noodles had a great texture.  I've also tried their Omakase Mini Kaiseki Dinner which was $47 a person. This is where I deduct a star. It was both expensive and not worth the price. The sushi and sashimi they give you for this are average whereas I know some places in Manhattan give you all different kinds in their Omakase for less. The broiled fish was also a little dry. I won't say the food wasn't good because it was, but the quality definitely doesn't match the price.  For dessert I recommend the green tea ice cream. They roll little rolls of green tea ice cream in matcha powder. The mochi ice cream is also delicious. Both are kind of overpriced but perfect to end the meal.",

    "text": "I gotta say - I just don't get it.  This place has a lot of good reviews, many of which claim that the food is the highlight of the place.  Maybe they were having an off day, but I just don't see it.     We ordered a roll combo and a deluxe sushi combo with the dinner set-ups.  The total was $49 before tip with just water to drink.  We started with the ginger salad - a small handful of spring mix with a glop of ginger dressing.  The dressing was bland and I really sort of missed the crunch of the traditional iceberg.  The soup had a weird aftertaste that I just couldn't place.  The fried chicken bites with lime were pretty good, though I didn't really understand that whole course as part of a sushi dinner.     The roll combo was pretty basic - a California roll, tuna roll, and salmon roll plus a eel hand roll.  Nothing fancy and nothing special.  They were actually a little skimpy on the fish if you ask me - it might have been high quality, but I couldn't taste it because it was overwhelmed by the rice, etc.  The eel roll was the best of the bunch, but again, not a lot of fish in it.  The deluxe sushi platter came with two roe offerings, a tuna roll, and some basic nigiri.  Again, nothing really to rave about.  My roll combo also suffered from a strange temperature issue.  It almost seemed like they rolled it up and then placed it under a heat lamp for a few minutes.    The decor and service were also nothing special, so again, I just don't get all the four and five star reviews.   I didn't hate it, but I have definitely had better sushi around town.",

I suppose that because people are the 'last call' they do not get anything fresh?  Should I have cooked and brought my own rice?  This was unfortunate, and my date and I both looked at each other thinking the same thing as we took our first piece from the roll(s).  And I wouldn't of given a rating had she not asked me disappointed if my sushi tasted a 'little different'.     Also, not sure how I feel about sitting in the waiting area while there are fifteen (15) tables available at 8:00 at night.  The only reason this restaurant received one (1) star was because my date looked beautiful and was a pleasure to be with.  Otherwise it would have received a -0-.  Do not do me wrong, the restaurant was in fact clean, with polite servants and was well air-conditioned.  Looking at this fairly,... this might have been a one time occurrence, non-recurring obviously, but because I will not be giving it another chance I do not see the chance for an improvement.  I cannot stand giving these types of ratings.  I think it is well justified.  Especially because I love and know my sushi.",

    "text": "Horrible. I should've listened to the other reviewers. There's definitely something strange about the way they run their business. To all the families out there with children - they will make it difficult for you.  I called before going because we have 4 young children. I asked if it would be busy around 6:30pm because we will have a party of 6. The person over the phone said, \"Probably not because it's still early - but no guarantees.\"   Upon arrival, I noticed there were couple 4-tops and a couple 2-tops open, so it wasn't packed. No one else was waiting. The first hostess said that it would 10-15 min to seat us - no problem we thought... then soon after, another hostess (who has a particularly loud voice) - said that she could seat us at a 4 top (for the 6 of us). Mind you, there were already two larger groups there eating with tables to accommodate them (4top pushed together with a 2-top). We said we'd wait for one of the larger tables to open up. The hostess with the loud voice seemed incredibly annoyed, still trying to sell us on the 4 top - saying that people may eat slowly and she can't predict when they will get up. We didn't mind the wait and still held our position and said, we'd like to wait for a larger table. She AGAIN approaches us a minute later, saying \"we don't have high chairs or booster chairs...\" We said it's okay... Then she tries to sell us on the 4 top again. I'm not kidding you, she came  back to us another 3 times, trying to push us to squeeze into a 4 top. It was almost as if we were inconveniencing her by wanting to eat at the restaurant and she was presenting the situation as \"If you want to eat here, you have to hold your baby, and squeeze the rest of you on this small 4 top...\"  About 10 minutes go by, and a table of 4 get up. Perfect set up for us 4top + a 2 top right next to it, to push together. The hostess with the loud voice refused to seat us there. She wanted to squeeze us onto the very 4 top she tried to sell us on the minute we got there. She said it's a \"Friday night\"... Basically saying, she wanted to keep those tables open for others that MAY come. There wasn't anyone else waiting!  My husband flat out asked her, \"Do you not want us to eat here?\"  That's how flabbergasted he was. He then asked for the manager - which of course, she was... We decided to leave and give someone else our business. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  As we were outside of the restaurant figuring out where to eat, I decided to go back in and ask for the owner. When I walked in, I saw her talking to the sushi chef in the back. When she walked by, I asked her who the owner was because I wanted to talk to him/her - and she pointed to the sushi chef and she said reluctantly, \"He said we can push the those tables together...\" WHAT THE?!!! I looked at her... blinked a couple times... and walked out.  My husband and I believe that we were not seated because we had 4 kids, instead of 4 adults. That means, to take up those seats, the manager didn't think we'd ring a up a high enough bill - because kids typically do not eat as much as adults. There were two other larger groups there, with adults - one table holding a baby... why were we not treated the same?   Lastly: WHAT RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE HIGHCHAIRS??? Some of the most upscale restaurants we've been to have excess number of highchairs and booster seats. CHAYA, it's just sushi.",

The teriyaki steak was not what I was expecting but then again - how do I know if I have ever really had an authentic teriyaki.  The steak was broiled and came with a very thin steak-juice like sauce.  I'm more accustomed to a thicker sauce which is more prominent in the overall dish.  Not a deal breaker by any means.

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh on business and chose two Japanese restaurants that sounded good according to reviews. Before I give my review I just want to talk about reviews I have read. Most bad reviews seem to be about expense. Most good reviews are about really good food. I was looking for good Japanese comfort food including good sushi. The menu I found on line had some of my favorites such as shishamo, ika natto, maguro no yamakake, moro-Q, so I knew this was a Japanese run restaurant. I only had the chance to go to one and this was a gem. I understand they recently moved to a larger space. It was still full - a good sign. It is BYOB and the odd part there was a charge of $2 to rent an empty glass for sake or beer and $4.50 to rent an ice bucket. I had never seen this anywhere and considered it odd. Since my total bill was well over $200 just for food, these rental fees were a bit annoying. The only other \"bad\" thing may be just a personal opinion. There was a slight odor of grease in the air from fryers, which is still on my clothes and jacket this morning. I don't like that, but it has nothing to do with whether the food is good or not. I think they need some different ventilation.  The service was also great - very attentive and helpful. They all worked as a team, so several came by to see if we needed anything or to make suggestions. Finally, the food was excellent, just as I remember from all of my trips to Japan. The uni was truly fresh and was either California or Japan imported, since it was so sweet.  They didn't have another favorite (ika shiokara), but had a similar dish using baby (3\") whole squid. Just as delicious! The nigiri rice was perfectly formed and the nigiri were the correct/perfect size and all the fish was very delicious. The sauces were perfect (Japanese style to enhance flavors - not overpowering to hide flavors as is found in so many lesser quality restaurants). The hamachi kama was also wonderful.  Even the wasabi was real wasabi, not the powdered kind. That was a real treat. If I really like a place I would try to sit at the sushi bar next and the sushi chef appears to have lots of personality. That also means the sushi bar was totally full. Perhaps I'll have a chance next visit. If I am back in Pittsburgh, you can be sure I will go there again!",

The house salad was fine and I am told the gyoza were good.  The complimentary fried chicken was fatty but not in a good way and had no flavor except for oil.  The tempura was okay, a moderately light coating, but could have been lighter and the vegetables were all over-cooked, like they had been pre-cooked.  The chicken in the Don dish was overcooked and dry and the sauce was barely present with no dipping sauce for the tempura so it was a very dry dish.  Another persons tempura dipping sauce that I did try had no flavor.  The staff were all nice and quickly reactive, but not very proactive.",

The prices were inconsistent, with some rolls costing $4 and others $14 and nothing in between. How is it that an eel roll costs $4, while a dragon rolls costs $14 when it is defined as \"thinly sliced avocado on top of eel roll?\" Maybe the roll is 3x the size of the eel roll? I don't know. Also, the tempura udon was a rip-off at $13 a la carte.  I guess I would've let these things slide if I weren't so dissatisfied with their service. At the end of our meal, we had a couple cookies from the bakery next door (Allegro Hearth--highly recommended) and the server told us that outside food is not allowed and that they would be charging us $2/person for bringing it in. WTF? I understand their policy on no outside food, but how about a warning? And this isn't even like we brought in our own wine or a cake that they had to slice for us. We each had half of a cookie and it ended up costing our table the amount of 2 sushi rolls. Ridiculous.",

I am tired of having sushi here and realizing the specials are only a venue to unload the oldest fish.  Special pricing should be a chance to try something new and different.  Instead, what we have run into here at every sushi place, bar none, so far, is an avenue for using specials to dump old fish and I resent it.  If you run specials, it should be because you have gotten shipment on an unusual buy, or gotten a good price on that particular fish, not because it's old and you need to get rid of it. So, yes - this place is OK - Kiku is more reliable for freshness, but neither is as good as the most reliable neighborhood joint in other cities - Chicago, New York, etc.",

It's easy to tell the chef was well trained in how to prepare fish, everything was very clean and well prepared. Their sashimi and sushi are very fresh and the combination dinners are worth the price.  The staff was very attentive and respectful and service was great. The food was prepared incredible fast, there was hardly a wait for anything. It was surprising to see this restaurant so packed on a weekday night but obviously it's because it's a place people want to come back to often.",

    "text": "Chaya is a cozy Japanese place that despite having a very complete menu, falls short in executing a tasty meal.  I came in for a simple deluxe sashimi platter. The dinner set came with a salad and fried chicken appetizer.  The salad was a typical Japanese salad with sauce, and the chicken was alright. It was boneless, which was a treat, but had nothing special.   The main was the sashimi, which to my disappointment came in a pretty small portion. There were maybe 12 pieces total, which is quite expensive at 35$. However, the biggest disappointment was probably the sashimi itself. The fish did not taste very fresh, knife skills of the chef weren't great (I had some scrappy pieces), and I had quite a few bites of tendon. I also want quite sure how the fish was prepared, but their taste wasn't very clean...the fish tasted really old and dirty.  Also, having hot rice served with the sashimi was a real setback. The temperatures completely clashed, and the loose rice did not pair well with the more slimy texture of the fish. I think sushi rice needs to be considered here...  I had a dessert before I left, which I enjoyed. But it was basically an off the shelf ice cream mochi, which you can get basically anywhere.  Overall, the place is very complete and stands out as a higher end sushi place, but the fish quality, serving preparation and small choices in dishes really downgraded the otherwise impressive menu items.",

It's got a pretty traditional Japanese vibe that not a lot of other places in Pittsburgh have. I've had the teriyaki salmon, broiled salmon, fried chicken and fried tofu at Chaya.   The fried tofu had a good texture but the sauce was quite different from the typical agedashi tofu sauce i'm used to. It was a bit more on the ginger side. The plating was adorable though.  (I didn't photograph our actual order of fired chicken only the 3 pieces that came with the The texture of the fried chicken was actually quite good, especially with the lime to cut the oiliness but there was no dipping sauce! :( In california, I'm pretty sure every place I've had karaage has some kind of mayo based dipping sauce that really completes it.   I barely remember the salmon it was well cooked with some nice crispy parts and was pretty soft but there was barely any flavor to it in my opinion.  Being from California, I was raised used to eating at a lot of Japanese places so my opinion might be a bit harsher! I've got to say Chaya has the environment down, but the food was overall pretty bland and overpriced. However, I still give it a good rating just since there aren't many other places in Pittsburgh like it and the service was great as well.",

Cons-   HOWEVER, the service provided by the wait staff was less than professional. My friends and I were spoken to an a loud, obnoxious, unprofessional manner. Kicker - I was celebrating one of my friend's birthday. So - this type of unprofessional behavior made things worse.   Customers BEWARE !!! do not come here if you want good service!!  For starters, I was asked if the bill would be made together or separate BEFORE I ever even ordered my meal. I don't think my friends and I even ordered a drink when that waitress asked us.   Anyways, my friends and I continue on - looking over the menu - when one of my friends had a question regarding two items on the menu and the differences. We were able to flag down a lady for assistance - she was an older lady not wearing a komono- she explained in a really loud voice and animated manner - the difference between the two. I felt she didn't have to say in that way nor that loudly - it just seemed unnecessary and I professional.   Anyways food is ordered and received. My friends finished first. So I told them to start eating the dessert which was macaroons I brought from Gaby Et Jules since it was my friend's birthday. Then that same lady without the komono stopped abruptly by our table - and said very rudely that we can not eat outside food at the restaurant and if so it is $2 per person - she said it loud - and obnoxious- this was my friend's birthday! I can afford to pay $2 a person - I felt the lady should have just told us the rule - professionally  because obviously we didn't know - then she essentially gave my friends and I an ultimatum - saying If we don't put away the food then she will be charging as that $2 each - like ??? She didn't give an opportunity to asborb the information - really create an awkward atmosphere - I did not like it -  Then to top things off - they don't take American Express!   Chaya - I hope you take ownership for your unprofessionalism and do some self reflection- to effect a change ! This is unacceptable.",

We had a really large group tonight, so that may have also played a part, but this review is basically for the past 3-4 times we've been.  Traditionally, what has set this place apart is the quality of their ingredients and the overwhelmingly incredible flavors that they have been able to achieve with simplicity and traditional Japanese techniques. Tonight, well, it was pretty mediocre.  We arrived as a group of 9 - 6 adults and 3 fairly young kids, and the hostess sort of rolled her eyes at that. Until today, we were always greeted with a smile and a genuine sense that they were happy to see us. We were seated fairly quickly, though, so we just let that go.  Ordering wasn't too bad - we all wrote out what we wanted and didn't make it hard on our server by going round and round. We had one list, and everything came as ordered.  Here's where it gets a little sad for me - I've written several reviews of this place before and it's sad for me to say that I think that the quality of the ingredients has dipped a bit. The fish was a bit \"mealy\" these past few times, and the availability of unique off-menu specials like fresh uni is pretty much a rare thing. It wasn't bad, but it was just average. That's a big letdown for me. This area is a bit of a haul for us, it's BYOB, and parking stinks - we have always overlooked these inconveniences because of the amazing quality and service the extra effort (and price) provided. It just wasn't there these past few times.  Oh yes, the gyozas and chicken kara-age were pretty good; as was the beef negimaki. It's just that the rest seemed so diminished from what we've had before.  As we left, we heard the staff apologize to some folks waiting for a table, saying that \"unfortunately the big party that just left took much longer than normal.\" I guess our almost $300 check wasn't worth it to them. Oh well - it will definitely be a while before we go back to see if things have changed. Maybe other folks can take advantage of us not taking up space.",

We had the tuna roll and added spicy sauce to it, the eel roll, the squirrel hill roll, the spider roll, and the tropical tempura roll. 9 rolls and 2 teas cost us about $60 which isn't bad in my opinion. The sushi menu is listed on the table rather than in the menu book. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The decor looked traditional and the other dishes around us looked so delicious! We will definitely be coming back.",

The sushi is usually fresh, the wasabi is freshly grated, i believe they hand-make their Gyoza. However, a complaint; I assume the woman serving tables who is not wearing a kimono like the other 75% of staff is the owner or manager. She is disruptive, loud, and at times, very rude to customers. It makes me uncomfortable the way she bosses around the other servers. The place is small, so it's very noticeable. It would be nice if she could be slightly more quiet and professional.",

I agree with others, this place is expensive.  and therefore, only Super Deluxe Sushi Dinner set pays for itself with uni, scallop and raw shrimp.  You can get decent udon and tempura from other places with cheaper price.   No Sundays, no lunch and weekends are too crowded. I normally go on weekdays.    It is a Japanese-owned restaurant, the language gave it away.  I think the owner is here often too, 3/4 of the waitresses are wearing robes, and the one bossing around wears a T-shirt. It's a reasonable guess.  The owner's English is so-so. She is a good person, but sometimes just hard to communicate with.  I only want to point this out, because i think this place's review is suffering from the awkwardness of the owner.  I honestly think that the other waitresses are more professional and the owner is often making things worse, though she does not mean it.",

    "text": "Chaya is an extremely impressive Japanese restaurant: the food is great, the sushi is leagues better than anything else in Pittsburgh that I've found, and because it's actually run by Japanese people who make pretty authentic stuff.  The menu is a little intimidating, especially if you're not tremendously versed in Japanese cuisine, because it's surprisingly long, and I just didn't know what the hell to order. In the end, I ordered a Deluxe Sushi & Sashimi Combination Dinner, and my girlfriend ordered two rolls and a tempura appetizer.   All the dinners come with a salad, miso soup, and some pieces of kaarage (fried boneless chicken). The salad is pretty average. The miso soup is quite good, but nothing to write home about. The kaarage, on the other hand, prompted me to write this review. These three pieces of juicy, tender, crispy chicken morsels were simply the best fried food of any sort I've had in the last year. I'd highly recommend that everyone opt for a 'dinner' rather than 'a la carte;' the $3 they charge on top is well worth it.  Moving on, the tempura was very well done, with everything evenly and lightly battered. Oftentimes Japanese places will be very heavy-handed with the batter, which makes for unenjoyable tempura, but Chaya's tempura was right on the mark.   As for sushi and sashimi, my combination came out with a very respectable amount of food. Then again, it was $32. In any case, the quality of the fish was very good, but not quite top-notch. It was easily the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh, but I have had better elsewhere. I really enjoyed their tuna, eel, and salmon. The quality of the sushi rice is simply superb. They either make their own ginger and wasabi, or they use a better quality, because both are far better than the norm, especially the ginger. My girlfriend's rolls, a Cali roll and a JJ Roll (tuna + cream cheese) were pretty mediocre, but the rice for that was amazing too.  Hands down best Japanese place in Pittsburgh, and I really wish I could give a 4.5, but I rounded down because it's a very solid restaurant, but it didn't astound me for the most part. Still, I'd recommend.",

I went back the other night to try their sushi and their snow crab hot pot which were delicious as well.  There were a few sublime mouthfuls in the meal that justify the price and also the effort it takes to free crab meat from its shell.  Chaya seems like the most authentic Japanese place in Pittsburgh and I love the cozy small restaurant feel it has to it.  I see myself being a regular here and wish I had found out about the place sooner.  The dinners may seem expensive but are worth it as they provide soup salad and fried chicken with the meal as well for a slightly higher price.  The wasabi they use here is of a higher quality and is just another signal that the restaurant focuses on authenticity and quality.  Its only open for dinner but still I'd like to try their entire menu!  I hope to go sometime to get the sushi boat they have for 3 or more people or the kiseiki dinner for which you have to make a reservation.",

Just to be fair, I'm a huge fan of japanese food, and it's become a religion for me to find good places. So I'm pretty picky about my japanese food.   I will be going there again, for sure, just because it's the best(?) place to go in Pittsburgh? Maybe if I get something good next time, I'll change my review.",

The sushi was fresh, but not really creative. I guess this place gets good reviews for having \"fresh fish\". But why shouldn't a sushi place have fresh fish? I don't think this restuarant should be rewarded for having something it is supposed to have. I don't think I will go back unless i am specifically in the neighberhood.",

The dining experience if colorful especially when the owner's wife is there.  She's super friendly and a bit eccentric but I love her.

I'm never a fan of sitting alone, but the server came over and was immediately friendly.  He noticed that I was wearing a race shirt and we started discussing our running history (his was far more impressive than mine!).  I wasn't starving, so I opted to grab an appetizer and a roll.  I went with the veggie tempura and an eel, cucumber, and avocado roll.  I found the tempura to be just right, but I wasn't in love with the tempura sauce (then again I'm not exactly an expert).  The sushi was fantastic and I was upset I didn't opt for more.  After completing those I considered getting some nigiri, the waiter was happy to make recommendations.

We strolled in for a date night on a Thursday around 6pm, and were seated immediately.  The restaurant is pretty small, so I'd imagine there can be quite a wait on weekends.  All the seats are pretty close together, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors!  But it's not a big deal if you have a good attitude.  The interior is bright, with lots of little Japanese accents in the decor.  The servers wear kimonos and sandals, and were very helpful to us.  Our server recommended an alternate appetizer, saying it was more popular (and, presumably better) then the one we had ordered - and she was right on the money!  Also, a woman who I believe was the owner came around to check on us a few times, and she actually moved my soy sauce dish closer to my right hand, saying it would be easier for me that way.  It wasn't an intrusive gesture - it felt sort of like a kindly mother giving you a little pointer.  Not being interested in paying $2 per person for BYOB, we just had water and I had an iced green tea, which came in a can but was still very tasty.  We began with miso soup and salad, which was the standard fare that you can expect at any sushi place.  Our appetizer was the \"giant clam cooked in its shell\" or something to that effect.  And indeed- out came a platter with a giant clam shell, with some sizzling bubbly goodness cooking inside it.  Why was it sizzling?  Oh, because it was on fire!  Well, the clam wasn't on fire, but there was some fuel source on the plate, and there were beautiful flames licking the clam shell and making our appetizer bubble in a most delicious looking way.  Not only delicious looking but delicious tasting, we loved the appetizer.  The clam is cooked in some sort of spicy mayo sauce, and it was pretty darn delectable.  I was licking my plate with my finger to get all of the sauce after we had eaten all the clam pieces.  Yummy!  I'd order that one again if I didn't want to try so many other things.  Most entrees looked expensive, so we decided to stick with sushi.  Their roll selection is simple, and I'd imagine it is also traditional - no crazy rolls here, just fresh fish and vegetables prepared simply.  We enjoyed the Sunrise ECA roll (eel, cucumber, avocado), the Mix Roll (tuna, salmon, whitefish), and the Tropical Island roll (shrimp, tuna, avocado, and radish sprouts).  The rolls are small, just six standard size pieces, but it was plenty of food for us along with the appetizer, soup, and salad.  The sushi was very good, clearly fresh, and pleasant to eat.  The rice seemed a bit dry to me, and the presentation wasn't flashy like you see at other sushi restaurants, but it was a satisfying and highly inexpensive dinner!  I think I would rather get sashimi and nigiri next time to really enjoy the quality of the fish, but the rolls were very good too.  Our bill was only $30, but I know next time we will try new things and it will cost a bit more.  Still, it was a lovely neighborhood restaurant with traditional, fresh food, and that's the kind of place where I'd like to return and give them more business.",

It doesn't have fancy rolls like you expect from other places so I could understand why some reviewers have been unhappy with the rolls. in fact, when we first moved to pittsburgh, my friends told me about it.  my gf hated it because she's more into the decadent rolls with all the toppings and sauces (like nakama)   However like places in japan, the quality of fish is the most important attribute of this restaurant.  I've tried every sushi place in town and it has the best freshest fish in town , hands down!  now i cant keep my gf from going back to this place every other weekend when she's in town. we're going to be very sad we cant eat at this place anymore.",

The place is only open for dinner from Mon-Sat (don't people eat out on Sunday??!!).   We didn't get seated immediately because one of our friends hadn't arrived yet. When we told the waiter that she might not be coming, we still had to wait for another 15 minutes, although there were a few empty tables. I was kind of upset coz I was starving by then...   We ordered the sushi set (tuna, salmon, shrimp, fish egg) and soba. My friends ordered tempura and chicken teriyaki. Our waiter warned my friends about the chicken--they're free-range, so expect dryness (and they were dry!). The sushi was surprisingly good! I wouldn't say that they're the best sushi, but I enjoyed them. The soba was OK. The tempura was crunchy and not oily at all. The chicken teriyaki wasn't tasty at all--not because of the chicken, but the whole thing was tasteless. The sauce was very little and it didn't look appealing at all.   We had to wait for quite sometime for the food to arrive, but our waiter was kind and informative. I'll probably go there again if I crave for sushi... Otherwise, Murray Ave still has other gems.",

My favorite was a spicy sunrise tempura roll, but everything I tried was great.    So we had some edamame, just to have something to snack on with our beers.  Now my friends brought some Hoegaarden, but I wanted to try to mix it up a little so, Dos Equis accompanied me through the night and boy was it a great night and surprisingly went very well with the sushi.  Started off with spicy tuna and avocado roll and spicy tempura roll. It did take a little bit of time to get the order, but it was great once it arrived.  Normally I would/should just end with that, but I thought I might as well try something else of the menu.  Well the sunrise tempura roll was awesome, thoroughly enjoyed it.    Overall the service was very friendly and food was excellent.  This is the perfect spot for good sushi without all the overdone theatrics and spoofs of some other sushi joints.",

Orders come out at typical speed for a sushi bar.  You'll wait a little longer when they are busy.  Rolls are a perfect size - not to big, not too small.  Sashimi is a good sized too.    Japanese food is quite excellent as well.  I always have a hard time decided what to get here.  My only complain with Chaya has been with their ventilation systems lately.

When you order any of the meals, which they have a good selection of and is very authentic, there is always a starting salad with japanese ginger dressing which is excellent, a piece of fried chicken that is succulent and also a small bowl of miso soup that is just the right flavor.  The sushi here is always fairly fresh and they carry some of the harder to find fish such as fatty tuna.  The only negative we find with this restaurant is the small seating capacity and combined with the popularity and lack of the ability to make reservations, sometimes it is a long wait.  If you want good Japanese food in Pittsburgh, definitely visit this place.",

    "text": "My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed.   We started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received.   Misoshiru was very under-salted.   My unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.  My fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.  Why does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion.   Ideally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back.   We've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places.   Disappointed. :(  Good points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service.",

I thought I would have to choose one or two of the three though we spotted the sushi and tempura udon combination for two - perfect. There was a lot of food: salad w/ ginger dressing, an assortment of about a dozen sushi rolls (I was pretty full by then..), tempura, some fried chicken pieces and then a bowl of udon. I was stuffed!

All the pieces tasted fresh tonight, (including the uni which I believe had gone bad on my first visit)  Glad I went back, and I'll be back again.

    "text": "Ah, Yelp. ya let me down, big time.   High prices. Small portions. But worst of all, tasteless sushi. Perhaps I'm spoiled as a New Yorker by very many excellent sushi restaurants (and Pittsburghers who love this place spoiled by a lack of other Sushi venues in the 'Burgh), but my experience here was really poor.  The Deluxe Sushi was more expensive than in New York, yet consisted of fewer and tinier pieces. I'd like to say their tagline should be \"New York prices without New York quality\" but they don't offer New York quality or portions; perhaps it costs a lot to transport raw fish to Pittsburgh?  So if you're visiting friends or colleagues in Squirrel Hill and someone suggests sushi, wait til you get back to NYC or California.",

    "text": "I would admit that this is probably the only Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh that offers a more traditional, non-Americanized Japanese cuisine.  However, for their price (15-20$), the quality is sub-par at best.    I believe they are most known for their sushi, oft used in japanese society meetings - which i found them fine.  Their fried items (tonkatsu, tempura) seemed too oily - likely a result of reusing the same oil, the rice too dry (kiss of death for me for any japanese eatery) and the miso shiru too salty.  For a price around 20$... It is unacceptable.  In Japan, Chaya quality would be par with cafeteria food.  Would you seem justified in paying 20$?  Unless you are dying for sushi, I would recommend going to Kiku for a similar price range (may be slightly more expensive).",

    "text": "Y'know, in all the years I've lived in the neighborhood, I'd never been to this place.  Indeed I think the only Japanese restaurant I'd been to in Pittsburgh has been Kiku.  I finally tried this place the other night when my friend Karen and I decided it was just too hot to go to the Three Rivers Arts Festival.  So I'm not big on sushi 'cos there's just something about raw, uncooked animal flesh that doesn't set well with me.  For those of us who aren't sushi fans, they have a lot of other things on their menu and --yikes-- it can be a little pricey!  Oh but it looks all so good.  Well I kicked off my meal with some miso soup and believe me, I enjoy a good miso soup!  Whereas Karen did go for the sushi, I went for the Unagi Kabayaki or broiled eel which was really good.  I also opted for the complete dinner which inlcuded salad, a fried chicken appetizer, and the miso soup.  As I said, some of the items on the menu are a little expensive but the complete dinner I had was only about $19.00.  I topped my dinner off with some Mochi, which is green tea & red bean ice cream.  Just so you know, Chaya doesn't serve alcohol but they do have BYOB.  But I suggest you try the oolong ice tea like I did, which was very refreshing.  They also have a whole bunch of Japanese soft drinks too.",

    "text": "Pretty solid Japanese food, I must say. I'm originally from California and I go to school in New York so I've tasted some pretty good Japanese food before and I would definitely say that Chaya is among the top contenders. Is it the best Japanese food I've ever had? No, I wouldn't say that at all. But is it Japanese food that is enjoyable? Yes, I would definitely vouch for that.  I think my slight issue is that I feel like the prices are a bit more on the expensive side. I don't think some of the items on the menu are reasonable at all, but I mean, I suppose they can charge whatever they want since they're one of the better places I've had in Pittsburgh. Service is very nice and always coming by to ask how the food is and if you want any water refills so at least that is good.  If you want traditional Japanese cuisine in Pittsburgh and you have some money to spare, I would definitely say this is a place to go.",

    "text": "This is the best sushi place I've been to in Pittsburgh. It's pretty pricey for poor college students like me, but as a once in a while very special treat, I don't mind at all. I went here with a guy friend and we definitely came at the perfect time--around 6?--as we were leaving a huge rush of people came.  Chaya was so cute--everything in it is Japanese themed, from the origami on the wall, to the kimonos that the servers wore.  We ordered the dinner special for two which cost around $38 dollars and included salad, sushi, tempura, fried chicken, and udon.  I was so full by the time we finished the sushi, but I still made room for the udon and the tempura. The sushi was great. It was all the usual nigiri, but everything was very fresh, unlike a lot of sushi places in Pittsburgh. The friend chicken was definitely a treat. It was hot, tender, juicy and just plain delicious.  The tempura was crisp and delicate. I was a little surprised that no sweet soy sauce was given, but that wasn't a big deal at all. The udon was tasty as well. Not the best I've had, but still very good.  I really liked this place because unlike most of the sushi places in Pittsburgh, it wasn't a Japanese fusion place. It seemed very genuine and the food was great and fresh ^_____^   I will definitely be back for special occasions :)",

The service was insanely slow- beyond ridiculous. So brutal.  Also, there looked like there was only one Sushi chef on a busy Friday night. The sushi and sashimi were well below average, both not smelling or tasting freshly.  Also, it wasn't a \"cheap\" place. All and all I was thoroughly disappointed with the ridiculously slow service as well as the sub par food. Yuck!",

I stayed in Japan for a month and the atmosphere absolutely reeks of Japanese sensibility. Slightly cramped and personal but not too personal.  The sushi is divine and it's been described a million times before me. Each piece is a perfect cut and perfectly constructed. The temperature is just below room temp so it melts in your mouth. The ingredients are some of the freshest in the city.  Don't just go for the sushi. Try some of the other dishes, you might be surprised and like them. The inclusion of fried chicken, while seemingly odd, is an accurate accoutrement in Japan.  Love it, love it, love it.

It was apparent that our server was very busy and had too many tables but she still provided decent service. The menu is simple and we ordered sushi and some dessert. The sushi was very good. Not the crazy sushi that has become all the rage with rolls as big as your fist, just plain old simple sushi focused on good fish. It was a nice change of pace. The rolls were reasonably priced as was the rest of the menu.  We both said we would definitely come back and we liked the atmosphere.",

Having lived in Seattle last year if I were comparing to everywhere I've been I would probably rate it 3 stars but good sushi is hard to find here.  My friend and I shared a sushi/sashimi combo and ordered a couple of rolls.  Everything was very good and seemed fresh.  Portions and prices were decent.  Definitely a good value for the price.  Not the best quality sushi I've ever had, but for Pittsburgh it's the best I've seen so far, but I haven't tried Umi yet which seems to be a lot pricier.  Ambiance was nice and service was good.  Food came out quickly.  I appreciated the other reviews on here alerting me that the restaurant was BYOB and so I came prepared with my own beer.  I kind of like that aspect of this place since Japanese places that do serve beer usually have a pretty limited selection.",
