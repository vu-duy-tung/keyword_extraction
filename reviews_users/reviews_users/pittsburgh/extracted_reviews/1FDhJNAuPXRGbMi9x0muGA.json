    "text": "Oh joes. It's a cookie cutter of a place. If you have been to one you have been to them all. But when it comes to a bucket of crab they do a good job of it. We sat outside and enjoyed the sunset over two great buckets of lobster and crab. But really. I enjoy going about one time a year and they always provide good service and a relaxed very casual setting. It's a little pricy but hey it's crab. This joes is clean and has good service with the food flying out right behind it.  The only bad thing about almost all the joes I have been two is the shrimp is always over cooked. I can tell they toss it in with the crab that takes longer to cook to speed things up but it just comes out a little tough. So avoiding the shrimp in the buckets the other shrimp is always good including the stuffed shrimp. I also really enjoy the crab dip and key lime pie when I get it. For a chain it's a great place and this one in station square is very good.",

I have never been there before and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place was. My boyfriend had the king crab meal. They got him a bib and brought out this big bucket of crab legs, he loved it. I didn't really want crab legs so I ordered the garlicky mussels, some type of steam pot (with crab rice, hush puppies, and shrimp & bacon skewers), It was great especially the shrimp concoction. My daughter got some pizza and fries I think (normal kids stuff). We all shared This Ice cream turtle thing, there was more than enough of it for all of us. Everything was absolutely fabulous and our water Jake was great. We sat outside which has a kids little play area, gives the adults some time to talk and keeps the kids busy. Great place would definitely come back!!!",

It was 6pm when do they change their oil? For the overall quality you are given the value is 2x what you should be paying. It's on par with Red Lobster, the only difference is they shove everything in a pale. My 4 yr old like that...If I was that Pelican I would have flown away if I knew better.

    "text": "I think I liked my experience at this location a shade more than I did at the one in Robinson, if for no other reason than I just got down and dirty, y'know?  Instead of trying to order civilized, traditional fare like crabcakes and fish filets, (what kind of flake orders chicken or steak at a seafood restaurant???) one has to indulge in a bucket or steampot  to truly capture the gist of JCS.   So I went with an Arctic Bay Steampot; a metal pail filled with queen crab legs, a split lobster, shrimp (complete with shells, legs...and eyes!), potatoes, a sausage, and a cob of corn all dusted with that arcane seasoning that makes anything taste exotic: Old Bay.   It's work I tell ya. You have to be careful. Spines from the armor of these critters will rend you, and when the seasoning gets inside those lacerations, your nerve endings scream. This time I was more savvy however, taking my time, imagining myself to not be in a chain restaurant but seaside with Bourdain on some trip, eating everything out of a bag on a bench.   It takes a stretch of time to get through everything. I had this innate need to save the best things for last, but I ignored it, going for the lobster midway through the meal. Yes, you're cracking and twisting and zipping, dismantling the poor, dead things like Magnus taking down robots sometime in 4000 AD. All you want is that meat--a nice, intact, large portion of that meat-- to drench in melted butter. Your fingers wiggle in anticipation of that perfect morsel.   It never seems like enough, though. You fill up on the boiled potatoes, corn, and dessert, but you still want more seafood. You slurp on the empty shells just to get one more taste of the ocean, obsessing over creatures that fishermen drown trying to catch for your enjoyment.   Kay did allow me to try one of her mussels and a couple of her scallops, which I rather prized after baptizing them in that clarified butter.  Speaking of dessert, The Crabby Apple Crumble hit the spot, the grainy cinnamon ice cream serving as the ideal cap for this snug, full-bodied, rectangular twist on an American classic.   So I guess I kinda like JCS. Like I said, get a bucket or steampot, don't cogitate over it, and make sure you can afford it. Our bill was $84.56!!! Yipes!! Thankfully Kay had a $25 American Express gift card to give me some breathing room.   P.S. This JCS is a little hard to find. It's behind the former Island Cafe (now called Steel City Slammers). We had a heckuva time trying to locate it, wandering up and down Station Square like Mr. and Mrs. Magoo. Luckily I had their number in my cell phone.   P.P.S. We had no issues with the service.",

    "text": "One of my favorite place to eat, JOE'S!!! Forget Red Lobster, if you want quality seafood and you are not by the ocean, this is THE place. One this occasion I wanted crabs (duh) and muscles. So what did I order? A steampot naturally! This pot contained legs, scallops, muscles, and the standard corn and potatoes.  As is tradition, I asked for a side of Old Bay and a bottle of malt vinegar to create my own paste, which I greedily dunk the meat in. The server, Nicole, was very patient as I requested these things and when I asked for Sweet N Low for my iced tea, I wasn't upset when she explained that they didn't carry it.   I got a side of hushpuppies to accompany my feast and was not disappointed in the least. I believe I may have converted Darren when he tried one after he told me he didn't like hushpuppies.   Growing up close to the Chesapeake Bay area, I have perfected the art of picking crabs and managed to get all of the meat out of almost every leg segment in whole. Darren loves watching me at work, never using a fork, and rarely using the nut crackers, or what they call crab crackers. These scallops were the best I have ever had! Seared on only one side and deliciously soft and juicy on the inside. The muscles were also amazing! I was saddened that I didn't have an endless plate of scallops and muscles. I have to say that I did have a pleasant surprise. When I was finished I looked under the plate that was in the pot and noticed an extra scallop and extra muscle! It felt like getting a small bonus!    I got the chocolate cake for dessert. It was huge! The flavor was ok, but I took home the few bites I couldn't finish and discovered that the cake tasted better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT AT JOE'S AGAIN!",

So, we opted for a booth inside.  This place is so kitzy.  Even the tables are a designer's worst nightmare.  They have beach junk everywhere.  Both times, our service was fairly attentive.  On our recent visit, I went crazy and got a Crab Daddy feast.  Three kinds of crab legs:  Snow crab, Dungeness crab and and King crab!  I honestly don't know which was which.  My bf even had to train me in the use of the crab cracker and the claw.  Love, love, loved playing with my food.  Nothing more fun than eating with your hands.  What a mess!!  It came with my choice of seasoning, I picked Chesapeake Style which is basically Old Bay Seasoning even on new potatoes and corn on the cob.  BJ got the Skillet Paella.  The skillet had clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops and sausage a tomato basil sauce served over rice and topped with crisp calamari.  No mess here.  He was cheating!  I believe there are three very important elements for a great dining experience.  Service, atmosphere and quality food.  Joe's Crab Shack seems to get by without any of these three......LOL",

We started off with the Great Balls Of Fire appetizer, which is jalapenos, cream cheese, crab, breaded and fried. Each is freshly made per order. They had Outstanding taste and worth every bit. For Dinner we had The Grill Daddy Feast Steam Pots, that consist of Alaskan King Crab, Snow Crab, Shrimp, Red Potatoes, Corn on the cob, all in a Steam Pot of a well seasoned Broth. All had soaked in the tasty seasonings making everything in it mouth watering good. Both types of Crab were sweet and meaty, the whole pot was outstanding. Watch those Kings though, they like to prick you with their sharp thorns, and mine got me good. But I pushed onward. My son said to say that the Fish Fingers and Fries for kids was a great pick for any kids. Our server Lisa did an awesome job too. Basically, We have never had a bad visit to Joe's.",

    "text": "Oh God. So. I have never been to a Joe's Crab Shack. Though, I've heard stories about it. Mostly from my family. Namely my Mom. Every year around my brother's birthday I get this hour and a half long phone call from my amusing and horrified mother because my brother asks her to go to Joe's Crab Shack for his birthday. It's kind of funny to me. Probably because I don't have to partake in the festive activities. They're in Michigan and our birthdays are two days apart from each other. But I get this phone call and hear a whimper: \"HE RODE THE PONY AROUND THE RESTAURANT WITH A PARTY HAT ON.\" And then I laugh for a solid five minutes and ask her how the fried fish was.   I finally got to try Joe's Crab Shack on my own venture though with sister. Just not in Michigan. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of options around Station Square for fine dining and almost everything was a chain. So it was a toss up between Hooters, the Melting Pot, Houlihans, and this shizzle. Your utensils are presented in buckets. But we weren't going for fancy. Together we split an order of hush puppies, some kind of crab nachos and a side salad (to be healthy, you know). The hush puppies were way more cake like than I remember them supposed to be. Maybe the cornmeal just wasn't moist enough. And there were actual chunks of corn in them, which is a huge mega turn off for me because I hate corn. HATE. Because they are niblets and I'm WEIRD. But I will eat cornbread and other various things made of corn. The crab nachos were made with a mayo like paste. Kind of tasty but also kind of sickening and too heavy.   If we want to talk about sick, that was my drink. I can't remember the name but I remember exactly what it was: Landshark beer with tequila, lemon and hot sauce. The waiter joked saying, \"It might be too SPICY for you!\" It wasn't too spicy for me. It was just disgusting tasting. While MJ was trying to convince me 'to heal the world' in the background, I realized, you know, I'm not really missing out on anything. We don't actually need a Joe's Crab Shack in New York. This place kind of sucks. At best, it's just another Red Lobster minus those cheesy biscuits.",

The one entree was not up to standard but since server constantly disappeared could not say anything . I definitely feel that this is turned me away from Joe's crabshack the food was all right but it was difficult to enjoy when the other entree it was not edible. Was there a half hour before the server reappeared. Would love that they would see this and reach out to make said love to go in detail with the management. Have to say this company's guest relations text comments very seriously and has changed my mind and I will give them another shot",

    "text": "It isn't that I didn't enjoy my food and the service.  It just didn't live up to my experience at other Joe's I've been to.  I have been to Joe's in two other cities and had better, more memorable experiences.    To some extent, we felt rushed.  Only a few minutes after taking our drink order, the server came back three times asking if we were ready to order.  I felt pressured to make a choice.  The drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal.  Too quickly.  We had barely dug into the appetizers when the entrees were brought out.  Usually this isn't that big an issue, but when you are having one of the hot pots, you basically have to start eating it right away (because who likes cold crab legs or clams?).  We were there on a Saturday night, so perhaps they are set up so they can have a quick turn around and get a lot of people through with minimal wait times, but I personally like to take time to savor my meals.    If you like food with a kick, I highly recommend the \"great balls of fire\" appetizer.  Filled with flavor, but with just the right amount of spice to not kill your tastebuds.  For an entree, I had the Joe's Classic steam pot.  It was tasty, but didn't seem as flavorful as I had expected.  My dining companion had chicken tenders and he thought they were very tasty.  It is nice that they have options like steak and chicken tenders at a restaurant that focuses on seafood.  Many similiar locations have far fewer options.  Overall, food was decent and service was OK.  There are just a lot more restaurants that I'd prefer to visit again (or for the first time) before I'll come back to Joe's.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure Joe's Crab Shack is one of Pittsburgh's top seafood options, even if some new restaurants have come in and started competing with them for the seafood crown. If it doesn't sit on the seafood throne overlooking the entire city, it definitely rules in Station Square. In fact, the only reason I've detracted a star from Joe's is that I personally think they could use a few more non-seafood items on their menu, but considering the words \"crab shack\" are in the place's name, I really can't hold too much of a grudge on this one.  That said: if you want crab, get on over to Joe's and take a seat somewhere in their eclectic, funky, beach house themed dining area. You'll get an entire bucket of it - as long as you're willing to lighten your wallet a substantial amount. Their steampots, which feature mixed seafood samplers, are also very popular. And of course, most of the appetizers you can get to go with the bucket of crab or other enormous seafood platter are also seafood based. (I highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms.)  My meals and the service alike have never disappointed when I've visited Joe's. I do have one word of caution for my fellow casual dieters out there: nothing is small. If you want to eat healthy during your night out, a salad here will not help you reach that goal. Even the margarita glasses are gargantuan in size; it's hard to even wrap a single hand around them, and they're so heavy at first it may take two hands to pick up the glass without taking the chance that you'll drop the entire thing. The smallest menu items I know of are things like the Sunset Salmon, a well seasoned strip of salmon with potatoes and green beans. It's simple, but yummy - I recommend it.  If you have the time and the money saved to satisfy your craving for some really good fish, this is your home sweet home for a wonderful evening out. Everyone else? Better learn to love seafood quickly. Or just try one of the Square's other restaurants.",

We ordered 3 different appetizers, all were PHENOMENAL! The crab nachos were my favorite. SO SO GOOD.  Our waiter was so awesome, he unlocked the door to the patio, had us jump the fence and took a picture of us in front of the river in 5 degree weather.

    "text": "Say what you like about chain restaurants. I despise almost all of them. Almost. There are certain standards expected that chains rarely have the skill set to pull off. Chain diners don't fall into automatic failure, and Joe's Crab Shack also remains unaffected.   Shack, it's in the name, so you can't complain about the decor. Having been born on the east coast, my mom is from Maine-dad from Maryland, I know seafood. And you can't complain about the seafood here. The clam strips are gigantic and delicious, not sure how they could go wrong unless they were frozen, small, chewy bits of fried dough. Which they were not. The corn was very sweet for this time of year, that troubled me, but didn't stop me from eating it. The Snow, Queen, and King crabs were all delicious as well, stay safe and get old bay seasoning version.   Now the reason for three stars. There is zero beer selection. For anyone that would like to drink a delicious draft beer paired with seafood, you will not find the non chain/shore town seafood house selection. Just the normal collection of crappy, watered down pilsners made from corn and rice. To bad they didn't start stocking Mad Dog 20/20 to match, I would have ordered a fruit punch one. Or perhaps some Boone's Farm, Colt 45, or PBR. Hold on a minute, I take it all back. I've just been informed that they have PBR.",

We were seated by the window which gave us a nice view out onto the river. Our server was friendly and made conversation easily.  My dad and I shared a Classic Steampot and the Blackened Mahi Tacos. I thought the steampots came with both corn and potatoes, but our pot was missing potatoes. My dad wasn't bothered enough to say anything. The food was cooked well, but all the seafood and meat was too heavily seasoned and too salty for me. The only exceptions to this were the corn in the steampot (I ate the half covered by the husk, and it was delicious--crunchy and sweet) and the chips that came with the tacos. My dad and I also found that there wasn't nearly enough pico de gallo to eat with all the  tortilla chips.  It was a nice meal, but I'm not big on seafood so I probably won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I rate this a 3 because it was an OK seafood chain experience. I try to avoid chains whenever possible, so I probably wouldn't go here again, especially since I was not blown away by the food.  We took the Monongahela Incline down to Station Square from Mount Washington. Now I've learned to go the other way because Station Square is a tourist trap! There is no local flair at all...your choices include a Hard Rock, Buca di Beppo, Houlihan's, Subway... We had never been to a Joe's Crab Shack so we decided to give it a try.   Our server Colleen was great. She happily answered questions about the menu and was very cheery overall. Great service really makes the meal and she did a great job. Plus, she shares my name and we had a little giggle about that.  We decided to go with the Mussels as an appetizer. The mussels were ok, but they tasted a little overdone.   We decided to split The Big Hook Up, which included Fish and Chips, coconut shrimp, crab stuffed shrimp, hush-puppies, coleslaw and their signature \"Great Balls of Fire\" which were deep-fried balls of dough stuffed with cheese, crab and jalapenos. It was plenty of food for the two of us to split, but I didn't really think about how the majority of it was heavy and fried. They gave you a sizable portion of each and everything was good. The Great Balls of Fire were definitely a favorite while the hush-puppies were very disappointing (I LOVE HUSH-PUPPIES) and very dry.  We sat outside so we had a pretty cool view of the waterfront and loved that we got to see a train go by while we were eating.   Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but it was an OK experience for a seafood chain.",

Anyways, I thought the amount of food and the taste of food were great! I took my family here this past weekend and everyone came back full and satisfied! We ordered 2 steampots, the crab nachos and the jumbo coconut shrimp. Surprisingly, it was enough for all of us (granted, my sis doesn't really eat seafood so she was happy with her hushpuppies and fries...). I really recommend the KJ steampot because it came with loads of goodness: snow crab, scallops on a stick, clams, 3 Maine lobster claws, an ear of corn and potatoes. The garlicky sauce was yummers! Although I did see in one of the pictures posted here that it should have come with some tubs of clarified butter. We did not get those. Oh, well.  The crab kit that everyone got was super cute and the buckets at every table were useful. I liked the setup and the speed of the food coming was fast as well. Our waiter was friendly enough but kind of slow at responding to things...e.g. I asked him for a knife since it didn't come with that as part of the table setting. He just stared at me for a few seconds and left. After 15 minutes, he came back with a huge bucket of knives. Lol, one would have been enough but at least I got my knife!  The atmosphere was lively; it certainly a popular restaurant in Station Square. It smelled fishy and the furniture looked slightly damp. I just wish they provide free cheddar biscuits or something...",

This and red lobster are the reasons some people dislike seafood.   Gobs of potatoes, some not even cut.    A few unpeeled \"medium\" shrimp on the bottom and a sausage.  I almost don't want seafood again.    The place is empty.   No disrespect to the people that work here other than management.  Speak up ....  maybe not.",

My friend had the mahi mahi and I ordered the KJ Steampot, which had crab legs, mussels, and scallops.  I asked for mine with no mussels.  The waiter said that was fine but that I would not then get extra scallops.  I understood, I just really hate mussels but liked scallops.  It took FOREVER to get our food, so long that the manager came over and completely comped my KJ Steampot which was unexpected and nice of him.  So nice, I feel bad about this next part:  my friends mahi just sucked.  It was cold.  I think it must have been waiting for my meal to be served.  I could have made smething better at home.  then again, I could have hand reared the mahi mahi fish from egg to dinner in the time it took for our food to come out.  The presentation of my KJ steampot was cool, the scallops were on little sea shells.  They were also completely over cooked so they were chewy, and the flavor of the butter garlic sauce over powered them.  Basically there were a vehicle for garlic butter.    The crab legs themselves were also VERY overcooked which made them really hard to eat, the crab meat kept flaking in the shell and overall...just not amazing.  Also no happy hour except on Tuesday.  I will possibly be back, but it will be a while before I return!",

I came here with one of my good friends around his birthday, and he's a guy who pretty much always finishes his meal when he goes out. But this place was an exception. We had plenty of food to take home. We also paid enough for it; this place isn't the cheapest!    All said and done, I think it was worth it. The crabs are good, of course, but so are the other dishes. Their specials and platter options make it pretty easy for you to try quite a few different foods between your appetizer and main dish. It's in a cool spot too. I'd recommend it.",

I chose to have it seasoned with Old Bay. My girlfriend and her friend split a Steampot with mussels, shrimp, and clams. Both of our steam Pots were pretty dry. Definitely over cooked and not seasoned very well. We were all a little underwhelmed with our food. Even my crab was pretty dry. I was happy with our server as she did what she could and was pretty pleasant.",

On one of my many trips there i ordered my fave steampot and asked to hold the andouille sausage and add shrimp and mussels because i dont eat met.  My server Roxanne was awesome and understanding and relayed my order to the cooks. Unfortunately they (the cooks) didn't follow Roxanne's request and my steampot definitely had sausage in it. The kitchen Manager Kevin not only apologized profusely, but had my order replaced and took it off our bill. The thing that i appreciated the most was not that he took it off the bill or replaced my food but that both he and Roxanne was genuinely concerned that i not be upset and that i had an excellent experience. For that i hope Kevin and Roxanne get kudos, accolades, and accomodations for going above and beyond the call of duty and continuing to make me love Joe's. I also think they need a raise! Lol",

There are several different steampot mixes and each one comes with an assortment of seafood, which includes lobster, crab, shrimp, crawfish, sausages, potatoes, and corn.  My biggest issue was that the seafood wasn't too fresh. It was also heavily seasoned, which seemed to intentionally mask the age of the seafood. The restaurant was also very loud and chaotic.  Joe's didn't meet my expectations of other restaurants with the same concept that I have been to in California.  --  taste / 3 aesthetics / 2 vibe / 2 service / 2 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 2.4",

Then we ordered the Classic Sampler for $12.49 which had a bunch of different seafoods, my fav was the bacon wrapped shrimp on a skewer.    Our entree was the East Coast Platter w 2 nice fish filets, fries and other seafoods on it.  A bit pricy at $19.49 but still pretty good.    Service was a bit inattentive- more concerned with texting on her phone instead of taking care of customers but ultimately we had what we wanted, mostly when we wanted, so I can't fault the restaurant for that.

It may or may not look like a rundown piece of trash boat but the food is unbelievable. I mean this Joe guy should be president I am that impressed. I might actually drive an hour here in Pittsburgh and risking an accident to eat this food. Garlic bread was scrumptious and the rice with broccoli was divine. Joe my friend keep this up and you will go places. I mean I probably ate several families of shrimp but that's the sacrifice Joe makes to keep this business running or good reason. Also they have 10$ hats which is a steal and you know damn well I will represent this restauraunt well. Way to freaking go guys. Mwuah. P.S. no shellfish were harmed during this review.",

    "text": "Sunday was a beautiful day - high of 78 without a cloud in the sky - and I was craving seafood and a pretty view for lunch. I had never been to a Joe's Crab Shack before, but my husband runs by this location frequently and mentioned that it would be a good place to hang out by the river.  Station Square seemed a little busy (for Station Square) so I hopped out of the car before my husband parked to grab a table. I wasn't surprised that the inside of the restaurant was very quiet - only 5 or 10 parties - but I was surprised that the outside wasn't even full. The two of us were seated at a large picnic table - that could seat about 8 people - and enjoyed the beautiful outdoors under a large awning.   I started with the Southern Spiked Tea, which was a good sized beverage served to the brim of a mason jar. The alcohol content was low, but it was a tasty drink. For my meal, I ordered the Seaside Platter with a side of Hushpuppies. The food was as I had anticipated - descent fried seafood on the pricier side. Our final bill - for my drink and meal and my husband's meal - came to $55. If we had eaten in the smelly (fishy) interior on a crappy day, I would've been crabby about this cost, but I thought the view and weather alone was worth a good amount.  Though not blown away by the food, I was delightfully surprised by the service. Our waitress checked back with us multiple times, bringing us several refills and a couple different condiments. She wasn't the most bubbly or friendly girl but definitely did her job efficiently.",

It's an all day happy hour that is totally worth it. I had the Queen Crab the last time I was here and it was all types of awesome. Also try their hurricane drink. Your taste buds will thank you.",

That kid was also a little dirty, too. So was my shrimp. Yick to uncleaned shrimp.The hush puppies were pretty good.  They did have a list of appetizers that were half off during happy hour which is a good deal...but they should be that price all the time for what is offered.

    "text": "This is my second visit to Joe's Crab Shack. My first visit was not an entirely unpleasant experience, but at the same time it wasn't that great either. My rule of thumb is to give a restaurant two chances, and JCS won't be getting a third.  We arrived at approximately five o'clock on a Saturday. We were greeted by at least three people at the entrance and were told we would be seated shortly. The restaurant appeared to be about one third full and it took a few long minutes for the help to determine where we would be seated, which ended up being a booth about 15 feet away. Why the wait?  Upon being seated, we were warmly welcomed by our waitress, and our drink order was taken. I ordered a specialty lemonade with strawberry and kiwi, my friend ordered a beer and a glass of water. In a few minutes our waitress returned with a soft drink and a glass of water. Upon informing her of her mistake she quickly returned with the proper beverages, and told us to just keep the soft drink, no charge. She then took our order; I ordered their seafood platter and my friend ordered a shrimp dinner. We also ordered calamari for an appetizer. After about a 10 to 15 minute wait, I told my friend that the calamari was forgotten. About two minutes later, the runner arrived with our meals but no calamari. There were no condiments on the table, and our waitress was not nearby so I got the attention of another waitress to get us some ketchup. About a minute or so later our waitress returned and asked if we needed \"ketchup or anything\", I told her I already had another waitress getting it for us. She then asked if we ever got our calamari, I told her no and she offered to find out \"what happened and get it for us\". I declined the order as we already had or meals but she offered it free of charge. A nice gesture on her part and she informed us that the manager was going to talk with us. In a minute or so the manager approached us with the calamari, and said \"Here's your calamari, can I get you anything else?\" No inquiries about how our service was or how our food was. In fairness our waitress did inquire about our food several times. I declined to tell her the truth but I would have told the manager had he asked.  My seafood platter seemed as if it had been sitting under the lights; the six shrimp on the skewers were a bit dry and a bit difficult to slide off, the broiled fish portion was dry, the breaded fish was breaded fish, and the little popcorn whatevers were mostly breading. The calamari was standard issue. The flavors were standard seafood chain/Red Lobsterish. No lemon was present on my seafood platter. The entire meal was lukewarm at best. Pretty underwhelming. We declined dessert.  When I got the check, I looked it over to make sure that we weren't charged for the unordered soft drink or the forgotten calamari and we weren't. However the specialty lemonade that was about 50% ice was eight dollars! In total, our bill was over 52 dollars, and had we been charged for the calamari it would have been over 62 dollars.  Sorry for the long review, but when I patronize a restaurant that charges 62 dollars for a dinner for two, I expect a much better experience and much higher quality food than what I received. Joe's Crab Shack has failed me twice, and I won't be returning for a third disappointment.",

As someone who doesn't love seafood, I didn't think there was anything for me, but I was pleasantly surprised with their food items and ended up loving everything we had. First and foremost, our server was fantastic. He was incredibly knowledgeable and really friendly. He was on top of everything throughout our lunch. My sister ordered the corona margarita to start, which was tasty. For lunch, my dad ordered their platter with fried fish, clams, crab cakes, fries, hush puppies and coleslaw and he loved everything. My mom ordered the steak with shrimp and she also was really pleased with her meal. My sister and I split the coconut shrimp entree (around $16), as well as the garlic bread appetizer. The garlic bread was pretty good but the coconut shrimp entree was incredible. I did think the price was steep, until I saw how much shrimp you received with your order- 12! They were fried to perfection and the entree was plenty for the two of us to share and we even had some shrimp leftover. The coleslaw was fresh and tasty. The fries were seasoned perfectly and were delicious. The hushpuppies were a little smaller than I was expecting, but the flavor was perfect. The manager, Jeff, came by to check on our meals which we all really were impressed by. He was really friendly and we all appreciated him stopping by to see how our experience was. Overall, I was really impressed with Joe's Crab Shack and I will absolutely return for more delicious coconut shrimp!",

If you're looking for a seafood place to know your socks off, this isn't your place. But if you want to get a seafood craving out of your system, specifically crab legs, then this is your place.",

The bad, was served the wrong shrimp and had to wait for new order with no compensation. Broccoli was very bitter and coleslaw was icky.   The ugly, waitress Alex lied to us. was there for my daughter's 18th birthday, mentioned a hundred times lol. She ordered a non alcoholic version of shark bite (blue pineapple juice) and they explained it had to be in a different class so they put it in a class with led lights that delighted her. She asked if she could purchase the actual cup and was told waitress would check. My daughter asked for a refill and was told it was 1.50 and we agreed. at the end the waitress made a fuss about how the drinks and cup would be comped for her birthday.. Spoiler, they were not. When questioned she stammered about the first drink was really like 2 because it was in a different cup and the costs were less than taxes and she trailed off and just walked away. $9 not such a big deal but it dampened my kids day! and lost them a customer",

After ordering our app. we were told that they let it sit in the window too long and they had to heat it back up, meaning they threw it in the microwave. While waiting for our app. our \"steam pot for 2\" arrived. When we received the pot we asked if that was really the two person portion to which we were emphatically told it was. Then our server came and took it back bringing us our app. We asked the server if that size was right because we had seen many pots go by us that were much larger and she told us that it was the right size. Once done with the app. she brought out the same small pot as before but this time it was nice and cold. About five minutes later she came back to inform us that what she brought was indeed the steam pot for one and that she would bring another. Upon getting the bill we see that she charged us for both single pots instead of the cheaper pot for 2.   Needless to say we are very disappointed. There is no way that we would go back to this establishment given the poor service along with the sub par food. If you are looking for a good place for seafood in Pittsburgh try somewhere else because this is not the place to go.",

She disappeared for an inordinate amount of time then came back & said she had no tables free & it would take 10-15 minutes to clear a table. Mind you, this was at 2pm, the place was not very busy & I had just seconds before seen 3 tables free & clean on the patio, which is why I requested one.  She argued w/me on that point (great customer service).  I said my children are very hungry, can I put in their order while we wait for a table?  She replied bluntly, \"No.\"  I then said, \"So you're willing to lose the business of our whole family because you won't seat us outside when there's several tables available?\"  She shrugged her shoulders & went back to her \"other business.\"  Highly recommend you avoid this place unless you like your seafood with a huge side of ATTITUDE!",

Yes, I know most of the shrimp is frozen and prepared elsewhere and shipped to the 200 or so Joe's all over the country. Maybe it's the atmosphere, location, I think it's all of those reasons, and the food. I did a quick tip and proclaimed the burger with the fried shrimp and Cajun mayo one of the finest burgers I've ever had. Think about it, a juicy quarter pound burger still pink on the inside, a handful of tender fried shrimp on top of that. Purple onion, tomato, shredded lettuce and a huge dollop of spicy Cajun mayo that tastes so good it makes you want to swear. That's not all, the salads are amazing, the crab pots are good but not my thing. Onion rings are a Joe's specialty, I'd walk across broken glass and hot coals in a two dollar pair of Old Navy flip flops for those onion rings. Leave it to me though to go to a seafood place for a burger, but i say build a better burger and they will come. For an appetizer I love the spicy stuffed mushrooms or the crab cake. Not the best crab cake mind you, but it will do to take away the craving. I wash it all down with a super sweet and salt around the rim \"Shake a Rita\". It's not a meal I'd eat weekly or even monthly, but when the gang says let's go to Joe's I'm the first in the car with mouth watering!",

The first time was for lunch before we boarded the Gateway Clipper steamship. This place instantly became a favorite of my two boys (ages 4 and 7). Months after I visit, I ask my oldest son what was his favorite part of the visit to Pittsburgh and he says \"eating at Joes Crab Shack\". The food here has always been good, I cannot remember what we ordered in 2008 but I know it was great and the service is better then most places and that is amazing for a chain. Our 2nd visit was for 4th of July weekend and we ate there on the 3rd, not overly busy and we were seated right away. I wasn't too hungry so I figured a burger would be a light fare. I ordered the Surf and Turf burger thinking it would be skimped on becuase most platters with seafood the portions are stingy. But here that burger was a mouthful and then some, I literally sprained my jaw trying to open my mouth wide enough to take a bite into the burger. I was beyond full with that meal. My kids ordered off of the kids menu and ate almost all of their food (not an easy thing to do as they are picky eaters), so that is a testament of the quality of their food. Joe's crab shack has now become our family's place to go to eat out as a family, just like how my family did when I was a kid. We live near the Gaithersburg, MD location and frequent that location because of the good times and food we enjoyed at the Station Square location.",

Since it WAS a Bachelorette party, we decided to order the most ridiculous cocktails on the menu. I had something called \"Gone Fishing\" which was bright green, had gummy fish floating in it, and tasted just like the Jungle Juice of my college days... though it wasn't nearly as strong. My fault for ordering this, should have stuck to sangria, which was enjoyed by all.  I had the trio of shrimp as an entree, all were good, my favorite being the crab-stuffed shrimp. The portions were huge and I couldn't finish.  After our meals, the staff came out with a plate of whipped cream and told the bride she had to find the cherry without using her hands. After her face was sufficiently covered with whipped cream, they revealed that there was no cherry to be had. Ok, I get that this place has a \"zany\" vibe, and I'm all for a good time, but what the hell? No young woman on her big night out wants to mess up her make-up and make a fool of herself in front of all of her friends and a restaurant full of strangers. Save the antics for kid's birthday parties!",

    "text": "Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?",

    "text": "I visited the station square location on Wednesday around dinner time, since they offer all you can eat shrimp for $20. Not only did I love the surroundings of this location and the city view, but my entire experience was awesome. I've also eaten at other Joe's stores, but this one had impressed me the most. First and foremost, the store is extremely clean. This is one of the major things I notice when out dining. After being seated, I ordered a pineapple pina colada which is served in a carved out pineapple. I highly recommend this drink!! They are fabulous! For dinner I ordered the all you can eat shrimp, steamed. I didn't have to wait long for my food but I assume they expect and have shrimp ready on those days. The staff was pleasant and the manager had made sure everything was to my liking. He actually was kind enough to show me a better way of opening the shrimp so I could spend more time eating them rather than peeling them. If you're in the area and are in the mood for some seafood, I highly recommend this spot. The prices aren't bad and it left a great impression.",

I asked for advice on a non fried seafood portion that wasn't huge, but the hostess couldn't think of anything.  The sandwich was mediocre, and the fries were soggy and limp.  I wanted a salad rather than fries, but the hostess wasn't able to figure out how to order that instead, and rather than wait I just went with fries.  If you go here, go hungry, know the portions are huge, and skip the chicken sandwich.",

We put our names in at the front door as there was about a 15 - 30 minute wait.  We walked around Station Square enjoying the fountain show and the music.  When we were seated outside, we were thrilled at the atmosphere, picnic tables, lots of elbow room, buckets of silverware and napikins, buckets for shells and crablegs.  Our waitress took our drink orders and we read over the menu.  Our drinks came back really fast, a Pina Colada for my mom, and a Sangria for me.  We both ordred Steampots of Crab!  Talk about fantastic!  I got Joes Classic, with crab, shrimp and sausage, potatoes and corn.  My mom got one with three different types of crab in it.  We laughed and ate, and laughed some more.  This was one my best restaurant experiences.",

The dinners were served 90 minutes later. Each of the six entrees were lukewarm. The fries were cold. The shrimp had no old bay seasoning. Popcorn shrimp was void of any flavor whatsoever. On a scale of 1-10, this meal rated a 3 at best, one level higher than Long John Silvers. At $150 for six meals, we would have been better off ordering a pizza and had it delivered to our boat.
