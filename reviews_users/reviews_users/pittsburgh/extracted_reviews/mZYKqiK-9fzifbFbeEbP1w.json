It wasn't amazing where i would remember as superb.  Food wise it was decent. The wine menu was accommodating, this is also were we had the best from our server, as he did a good job on suggesting a pairing that fit most of our groups dishes. The portions were on the smaller side with enough but hungry, which is a good thing unless you love to stuff yourself.  Pricing for what it was i felt a little high. Not as high as some places i would highly recommend, but it simply isnt memorible enough to spend what we did.",

    "text": "My work team had a belated holiday lunch yesterday at McCormick and Schmick's. Though I work in South Side Works, I haven't eaten here in over a year so I was happy to come back and get a fresh perspective of the restaurant, especially since my previous opinion was pretty indifferent.   The customer service was good. A table for 10 was set up in a nice section of the restaurant before we arrived. We were promptly seated and had an efficient waitress. All went smoothly with service except confusion over who received which entree. Three co-workers ordered the same meal but with different substitutions, and each person received the wrong entree which resulted in some confusion and awkwardly passing plates of food around the table to correct the issue.   I ordered the Ham & Brie sandwich with Blue Cheese and Apricot preserves and a side of Sweet Potato fries. The fries were very tasty - though is it possible to make Sweet Potato fries not tasty? - but I was disappointed in my sandwich. The bread had been toasted/grilled unevenly. One side was brown and crispy while the other side was mushy and buttery.  The sandwich was loaded with ham but only had a small slice of Brie. The blue cheese was nonexistent, and I could only taste the apricot preserves in a couple bites.   I have a couple co-workers who are obsessed with the scallops and crab cakes here at McCormick... But as a restaurant option near many corporate offices, they should offer a great lunch. However, though they try to be creative, I would still rather get a sandwich or salad at Panera than pay 50% more here.",

Things have changed.  Spoiled iced tea, cold crab bisque, oil slick root vegetables...oh my!  Not to mention, you ran out of mashed potatoes!  What kind of restaurant runs out of mashed potatoes!!!  Our final bill included the Shrimp Trilogy, Swordfish, cocktail and a bottle of S. Pellegrino and the grand total was $82.93!  Yes, you read that correctly, we complained 3 times, had two items deducted from our bill and it was still $82.93.  The server tried her best.  Unfortunately, we won't be back.",

You can't get a better deal than that!  I don't know about you guys, but I go to happy hour to eat AND drink!  It's dinner time...and I get hangry (hungry + angry) so food must be consumed.    You can also get an array of apps for only $1.95 like crab cakes, spinach dip, fish taco's, etc.  There's also \"fancier\" apps for about $5 like mahi cakes, mussels and pierogies (um, what?  ok!).  They're probably a good serving for one person, but for that price you can order a couple for the table.    The drink specials aren't that great on the other end of things, definitely not dirt cheap like the food.  They're from $4-7 dollars for beers, wine and the fancier drinks.  Meh.  If you're dining in for dinner, the food isn't bad, but nothing too memorable.  I've had the Ahi Tuna, which is good, but not as fresh tasting, and cooked a little more than I'd prefer.  The sushi is also just kinda meh, again, just not as fresh tasting as some of the local joints we have around.    I'll just stick to stuffing my face on the cheap for Happy Hour!",

Just bread not butter or olive oil on the side nothing. Waited one hour and a half for appetizers meanwhile a table that had been sitting since before we got there was waiting an hour just for their dessert. There are literally three tables being served on. The waiter forgot what we ordered and brought out the wrong dishes and no spoons for the soup. The salad was missing ingredients. This service was terrible and I can't believe we sat through it all. Charged us incorrectly for our meal at the end too. I've been to restaurants where I've had to wait a while due to low staffing but I'm usually compensated with bread or drinks or something or even being told at the beginning what the situation was. I remember walking in with my parents and we told him we'd like to order immediately so we can leave sooner and the waiter laughed. Now I know why. My steak was supposed to be medium and it came out well done. Overall this was bad. I don't care if my waiter had a peppy happy attitude because his service was terrible by giving us excuses...we didn't come to dinner to listen to someone tell us how busy the day was and how they send all their staff home early. Don't come here it's terrible all around.",

Our glasses were empty most of the time and we asked for the dessert menu as our food arrived because we knew we wouldn't see him again for who knows how long.  I'll never eat here again.

Along with it being overpriced (and mostly every other restaurant in this area does this), you have to pay for parking.. Which is not covered by the restaurant. If my husband and I are spending at least 85 dollars without alcohol.. $3 parking should be covered. Would also have appreciated not being solicited to buy into their rewards card... Too nice of a place to be in this area and trying to get people to sign up for a random card for points. I got the ribeye which was good, a little over cooked. My husband got the Mahi-Mahi, also good.. Very mild if that is what you like for fish. Perhaps my expectations are too high, but you don't feel like you're being treated as if you're spending a large amount of money.",

The fish was dry and hard and kind of grey looking. Potato and veggie was good. The manager came at my request and offered to have another swordfish grilled. I questioned whether he thought it would be any better because I felt the quality of the first one was poor. He thought it would be better. It wasn't. Basically they tried to undercook a bad piece of fish to make it juicy.  So my rating for everything is a 1 bumped up to a 2 for removing the cost of the dinner. I would have given a three if they had realized they had bad swordfish steaks and suggested a fish they knew would be of high quality .  I left hungry.",

When we asked our server if we could get them, she checked and came back with a yes.  We expected to pay the normal entree portion and did not mind doing so as it was what we had wanted.  When the bill arrived, we saw that they charged us the 1.95 per taco happy hour price.  Needless to say, we appreciate what she did for us and applaud her being so kind, helpful and generous unexpectedly.   We will definitely come back since she took such good care of us!",

The Mussels where like tiny gum bands and many shells where missing the mussel. Really a rip off for what you get. Now onto my freezer bag of PEI Mussels from Trader Joes = Large tasty, great mouth feel and not rubbery and a big bunch for less than $6. That being said I did add a 1/3 cup of my own white Italian wine, Garlic and more butter. But aside from that every shell had a giant gem of a mussel and not a tiny, over cooked microscopic gum band.  Sad excuse for a appetizer - McCormicks & Schmicks.

Anyways, we started with the seasonal spring sashimi and oysters. I liked the assortment of delectables on the sashimi plate; it offered a fresh contrast between spicy, bitter, and fatty. My group really liked the oysters. The couple of oysters I tried were fine.  For the main entree, I had another seasonal special: the Cobia with crab chimichurri. I was underwhelmed with this dish. The Cobia was thoroughly cooked through and did not have enough flavor to be served as a feature; hence the chimichurri! I thought this was a great idea fir a pairing. Unfortunately, the chimi was not very flavorful. It was nowhere near as good as the chimichurris I've had at Gaucho and Cure. Also, I did not taste or see any crab. I think the idea behind the dish is good, yet it needs to be executed better.  The dish came with a cheese pancake and a fried, stuffed jalapeno. I actually found these two items to be better than the fish. I think the jalapeno was stuffed with ricotta or a similar cheese. I wouldn't have mind a few of these as an appetizer!",

    "text": "What happened!?   I went back a couple of times, the second thinking the first was just a bad timing sort of thing but this used to be my favorite spot. The music is loud and I think they updated the paint and decor but I was just so distracted by the lack of care and the music being too loud for a cozy restaurant. I just couldn't believe this was the place I used to bring friends dates family and recommended it to everyone.   I ordered my usual strip steak and it was ok but not cooked perfect like the medium I desire. Every time  I went before it was always perfect. I get a caesar salad and it was bland and romaine tasted like a store bought bag. Beer was still good and wine was fine.   As for service, this is where I got confused and frustrated. Servers here used to be very friendly and had great personality with small talk and knew the menu like the back of their hand. The two prior times I thought I was being pranked. Different server both times but both had trouble finding their way back to our table. Ten minutes for a drink order of four and the place is half empty? A half hour for our food!? Then another twenty to have them ask if we wanted coffee or desert and then got our check.   I haven't gone back and have no plans to. Hopefully I get word of mouth that it's back to what I once liked about it and will maybe try it again. Third times a charm?",

I tried to flag folks down, they avoided eye contact as they buzzed in and out of the kitchen a from behind the bar. I asked a server for the wifi password, he said, \"Sorry, I don't know it,\" and walked away. I actually had to call him back and ask him to track it down for me. My food arrived quickly, (cashew crusted tilapia with no visible cashew coating) and the green beans and couscous were barely warm, luckily the fish was hot. I think there are far better places to try than McCormick and Schmick's.",

Others seem to agree: it was basically empty on Friday night at 7pm.  We really wanted to order combos (me: fish+shellfish, him: fish+steak), but none of the options had what we wanted so we stuck with just fish.  I had a pan seared halibut with lobster mashed potatoes. The fish was just ok. The mashed potatoes were ok, and then they poured this super salty gravy over it with the lobster. Disappointing for the most expensive fish and side dish on the menu.  My husband had the wagoo special with andouille sausage mashed potatoes. His fish was just ok too. I didn't try the meat potatoes.  The cocktails we tried (one was some type of mule) were better than average, and when we asked for one of them to be modified on the second round, the bar did a nice job with the request.   The service was good although our server didn't always have answers for many of the questions we asked, and she was a bit over the top happy. It was an \"honor\" to get us more napkins? Uh. She admitted that it was her 2nd or 3rd day, but she was unaccompanied, and I never saw her interact with a trainer or supervisor.",

    "text": "I love seafood so naturally a place that serves both seafood and steak can't go wrong. The decor in this place is beautiful!! High ceilings large booths, white cloth tables and even certain seats that have drawn curtains.   I first came here with my sister last year before a movie. Our server informed of us of the day's specials as well as his opinion of the wines we were interested in. We order a bottle of Blackstone Merlot and a dozen Virginia oysters. Delicious! The oysters were sweet and tasted as if they were bathed in purified water. Even with a squeeze of lemon they didn't lose their ocean flavor and pungency.   For an appetizer we enjoyed their fried calamari \"Fritto\" that is served with marinara and some kind of lemony cream sauce. The tasted light and crispy and even better once dipped in the sauces. My favorite was the lemon cream sauce. Besides squid there were various  types of vegetables like cauliflower, carrots and peppers. For our main course I selected a basic Caesar salad and my sister chose the same. The dressing was thick but their wasn't enough for the salad. when I asked for extra dressing our waiter brought us a small dish with only enough for one salad but we made it stretch any how. Towards the end of the meal we decided their was still room for desert.  My favorite part about this place is their upside down apple pie. It has a wonderfully buttery crust, warm soft apples drizzled in caramel and cinnamon. The topped it with a small scoop of french vanilla ice cream also drizzled in caramel and cinnamon. It complemented the pie so well and slowly melted from the apple pie warmth. The ice cream was very creamy and not watery or flavorless. It cost $10 a slice but is so worth it, my taste buds have never enjoyed pie more than they have at McCormick's.  With all the lovely decorations, warmth, and intimate environment i would list this place as a great spot for personal time away from the hustle and bustle or just a relaxing eat for you and your loved ones. I sometimes go here just for the apple pie ;)",

We still decided to give it a try while we were in town because my boyfriend's parents had heard the lobster bisque was great. We all ordered drinks which took forever to come out. (the bread came out and we were all on our second piece of bread when they finally brought the drinks). The waitress said \"these are all handcrafted and the bartender apologizes for taking so long.\" Carry on.. we placed our order. The lobster bisque was o-kay. I've had way better. It was very thick and greasy....It would be nice if the menu stated what the dishes come with (ie.. the steak and shrimp comes with... broccolini and potatoes) Our waitress seemed annoyed having to explain every dish comes with ____ which sounds petty for me to complain but it makes a difference in choosing whether to order sides or not. So the food came out without the broccolini and without someone else's side. The waitress apologized and said \"the chef apologizes\".. the portions of the food were small.. Seriously, the steak was in 5 little slices, the lobster was cold, the potatoes were cold and hard. I had ordered the shrimp scampi plate and the pasta could use more garlic, the shrimp was completely unseasoned. I also got a side of grilled asparagus which also was unseasoned. For dessert, we ordered 2  for creme brulee, only 1 came out. The kitchen had ran out of creme brulee (it wasnt even busy that night!!), so we got a complimentary choc mousse cheesecake and another apology from the kitchen. This place is not worth the amount of $$ we spent for dinner. It's a \"higher end\" seafood/steakhouse, but the quality is very chain restaurant-ish.",

    "text": "I am writing this review on behalf of my family because we had a terrible experience for thanksgiving. While the food was great the service, the logistics of our seating and table was despicable even with our early planning and reservation. My grandmother and grandfather live in Pittsburg and were looking for a good location to accommodate 30+ family members for thanksgiving dinner. We have enjoyed dinners at McCormick & Schmick's before and it seemed like a perfect choice with their thanksgiving dinner option.   My grandparents went to get lunch and discuss reservations options for a group of our size months before thanksgiving (in September). Upon making the reservation they were guaranteed three large tables next to each other. We were cautioned to have our group arrive on time, so we could all be seated, but besides that they guaranteed they could accommodate us and make our holiday wonderful.  As planned our large group arrived early or on time. Upon arrival we were told to gather at the bar as they readied our table. After 30 minutes (after our set reservation time passed) of waiting at the bar our group was over pouring onto tables around us, but we were finally seated. We were sat at two tables near each other and one table separated. It was as though they had not planned for our reservation or arrival at all. The table in between ours was an 80th birthday party. The group was clearly not in a rush, and I have no idea why the hostess anticipated they would be leaving quickly or on time for us. Since I have been a hostess at a large chain restaurant I know the intricacies involved with these reservations. Large parties especially special events should always be blocked for longer time and not dependent upon each other leaving.   When we addressed the manager with out unhappiness in our reservation she was flippant and annoyed. She simply said, well I am sorry the other party is still not done eating. This should never have been a problem in the first place. Thanksgiving is a very important night for restaurants and we were appalled that extra time and thought was not given to the seating arrangement. The manager and hostess not only made us wait a ridiculous amount of time for our reservation but sat our party separately.   The meal was good as expected, but the reservation, wait and attitude of the manager on duty put a bad taste in our mouths for the rest of the night. We will not be eating there again and I caution any other large group or special occasion to think twice before making a reservation.  A side note- I am mentioning last because I do not think this is necessary but should be noted- the manager did nothing to compensate us for the aggregation that we were caused financially or in specials or sides. Our family would still have been separated on thanksgiving, but we would at least have felt the manager cared about our situation. I would like to say I was shocked there was no remedy but after our experience with the staff I am not.",

Their location is convenient to SSW foot traffic and the combination of seemly tasty (though pricey) offerings displayed on the menus mounted outdoors along with the \"OMG - something new and modern here in the 'Burgh!\" factor was the initial draw of our small party.  Once inside we were hustled through a mosh pit style crowd surrounding the bar (I guess we're all desperate for something new in Pittsburgh) to a tiny bar table as the only available seating.  After our first round of drinks we were advised the actual wait for a table in the dining area would be considerably longer than initially expected.  Despite our cramped seating and jostling of the fuddled crowd we ordered another round and forged ahead dining were we sat.  Between the ambient chatter of the crowd and loud music we could barely hear ourselves think let alone comfortably speak with one another .  My sisters new fiance (eager to make a good impression on his future mother-in-law), made it clear to the waitress upfront that he would be taking care of our bill for the evening, but in True Rodney 'No Respect' Dangerfield style was consistently ignored throughout the evening, we were served incorrect drinks several times, the appetizers ordered were never brought out (yet were included on the bill), his dinner order was presented incorrectly twice... I could go on.  On some level it was comical how many things were going wrong and all we could do was laugh - as the saying goes 'doody happens'.  Admittedly, the wait staff was pleasant and appropriately apologetic.  The restaurant was beautiful inside (though not particularly unique) with lots of warm wood, white linens, soft lighting, and golden accents. The mark up on a glass of wine was ridiculous (you could buy a bottle for what they charge you for a glass in some cases), but the food was good.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on the service - perhaps they were just getting off to a rough start.  I'm sure we'd have had a different experience on the dining side of the restaurant had we waited for a table or made reservations, but I haven't felt inclined to return.  Our group consensus was that the price paid in money and aggravation wasn't worth that two hours of our lives.",

The food was ready they just had one server running back and forth to get it, so some of it came out cold. Our bill was over $600. I was surprised a manager never stopped over to apologize, offer dessert, anything for the fiasco our dinner was.  First time visiting this chain and we will not be returning.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at the Pittsburgh, PA Southside location for our second wedding anniversary. We had a reservation for 8:30 on Saturday, and showed up around 8:15. We had to push through a very heavy revolving door, and walked up to the greeter. She told us that our table would be ready right at 8:30, so we went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. We found two seats at the bar. The bar top was dirty, with a wet menu and the ticket from a previous guest at our seats. There were two bartenders, a male and a female, arguing over something. No one greeted us. Behind the bar, there were soiled glasses, utensils, and rags all over the place. Servers were frantically coming up to the bar to get drink orders while the bar tenders ran around and yelled. It was very tense. After 5 minutes, the bartender took my drink order of a Sam Adams. My wife asked what kind of wine she had, and the bartender grabbed the wet menu and flipped it over and gave it to her. When my beer arrived, the hostess came to take us to our table. I told her that I hadn't paid for my beer yet, nor had my wife ordered her wine. She said that it would be fine, and that she'd transfer the beer to our dinner check. When we were seated, a frantic male server came to ask my wife if she wanted something to drink. She ordered a glass of wine. He asked me if I had paid for my beer, and I explained what the hostess told me. He said it would be a few minutes for the wine, as he had to go to the bar to get it. I told him what a bad experience we had at the bar, to which he apologized. He came back moments later with the wine. He explained the menu, but never offered his name. We ordered appetizers and dinner as we enjoyed the bread and our drinks. Throughout most of our dinner, he was standing at the table next to us talking to another customer about his other job as an IT person, and about a business that he owned on the side. He only came back to us once ask if we needed more drinks and to inquire about our food. We still never got his name. My wife's dinner came with creme brulee, and she inquired if she could substitute for anything else. He told her no, and did not offer me any dessert options. He brought out the creme brulee and the check, and continued to talk to the guest next to us. At one point, one of the 4 hostesses came out to clear some tables as she ate a muffin. We paid and left. We asked if they validated parking, to which a hostess said \"nope\". One hostess said \"thanks\" as we were walking out the door.   The food was great. The service left much to be desired.",

While the service was painfully slow (i.e. 15 minutes wait for our $70 bottle of wine), the food - almond crusted rainbow trout with chive butter and macaroni and cheese - was very good. My hunch is that the service was slow because EVERY table was occupied and there were also several parties waiting to be seated. I actually liked M&S much more than places like the much-heralded Salt of the Earth (which I have been to three times) because the preparation was simple and you can enjoy the fundamental flavors of the fish without it being \"disguised\" by 16 other disparate ingredients.",

What a disappointment. It is very expensive and everything is a la carte. I suspect much of the food is corporate-produced, and most of the fish farmed and frozen. The \"wild\" salmon and halibut specials went for $36. I had steelhead trout that was overcooked, with sauteed chard and mushrooms for $22. Splurged on creme brulee that tasted like it came from a mix. The wine list is ultra overpriced. We had a cocktail at the bar while our daughters went shopping, it was OK, but the bartenders seemed asleep. The very worst part of the experience was the service. In a word it was awful. He must have been in training, either that or he was deaf. He asked our table of 4 if we wanted bread twice, when it finally came, it was a tiny piece. We didn't even bother to ask for more. Did I mention it's very expensive? Should have gone to the Cheesecake Factory down the block, which I loathe.",

Definitely not worthy of 4 stars, but this Christmas dinner that we had here was taking the place of the Christmas Day Dinner that my recently departed Gram would prepare.  So it had big shoes to fill.  There weren't many restaurants that were open on Christmas Day, and this was the one that seemed to be more middle of the road with a touch of elegance.  For a Pittsburgh joint, the decor and ambiance is pretty spiffy.  We arrived promptly at 3:20 for our 3:30 seating, and we had to wait approximately 30 minutes before we were seated.  A tad annoying when you have a reservation.  Another item that ranks high on the annoying list is that when we were finally seated closer to 4pm, we were ready to order the courses, the server announced that they were out of ham.  That indicates incredibly poor planning on the part of the restaurant?  To run out of ham on Christmas Day at 4pm in Pittsburgh?  The likelihood that they would have Christmas ham on their menu is the only way we were able to convince my Great Aunt to dine there in the first place.  After our orders were placed, the service improved significantly.  The food was decent, but the prime rib was a bit too fatty for my Great Aunt's taste.  I ordered Medium Well, and it wasn't served that way.  I held up a visibly chunk of red meat for the server to view, hoping she would say something, but she didn't notice.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their seafood dishes, but I think it would be a tough sell to have an encore meal there next year on Christmas Day.",

If you can get the wait staff to break from the script, they are usually quite friendly and eager to please.  As with many large \"upscale\" chain restaurants, butter seems to be the ingredient that is frequently overdone.  McCormick & Schmick's is no different.  They offer a 50% discount on lunches to employees of the South Side Works, and if I didn't benefit from that, I would never pay their normal prices for the food you get.",

We ordered an appetizer a bruschetta with veg and shrimp that was good. We had high expectations after that. I ordered the  cashew tilapia, which used to be pecan tilapia, and it was not as tasty as the pecan, but ok. My husband ordered  the fish stew and was surprised when it arrived. The waitress told us it came with a lobster tail on the top. Well it wasn't a stew at all and contained a few small shrimp, a few clams, muscles a tiny cob of corn mostly potatoes and to top it off the lobster was thermidor all mushy and unappetizing. . For $ 28.00 into even close to a value. Because our waitress disappeared,my husband flagged down the manager. She apologized and stated that was the recipe sent by corporate! They need to rethink that dish,as it is awful. They also need to bring back pecan tilapia and forget the cashew  coating not as tasty. It has such a nice atmosphere, but I can see why it is not crowded like the other restaurants we visited prior. The manager did take it off the bill, but by then our dinner was a disappointment. We eat out often and won't go there again. Come on corporate! There are so many delicious recipes, get out the cookbook!",

    "text": "This place is  located in a pretty fun place, south side works.  I  like the interesting shops in the area and a few restaurants.  Unfortunately, many of the restaurants are national chains like this one.  However, this place knows what it is doing.  You won't be blown away, but I've never had a bad meal here.  I went today with a couple friends and sat at the bar.  The space is nice enough with plenty of seating and high ceilings.  The bar area is pretty nice with a few hightops scattered about.  On the weekends this place can get pretty busy at the bar.  Today we were the only ones there.  The bartender Jen used to  work here and then she was at the Library down the street and now she's back again.  She's competent and friendly enough.  She said she makes a terrific bloody mary, so we ordered a few.  The bloody mary was very spicy and very strong.  It was a  good bloody mary and certainly wouldn't take more than two of these to wake you up in the am.  We started out with a nice very fresh sourdough bread with butter.  The sourdough was great.  I'm thinking \"Breadworks\".  I tried a smoked salmon appetizer that was served with red onions, capers, and chopped eggs.  It was very much a brunch dish.  The salmon was tasty and their were plenty of toppings.  The salmon was served on these crispy crackers with some type of flavorless sauce.  When  you  bite into the crackers the whole thing basically explodes.  It's not a very user friendly way to serve the salmon.  This would have been much better with just a bagel and some cream cheese.  I tried a friends \"Firecracker\" rolls.  It was basically a chicken egg roll.  It was okay, but not memorable.  He also ordered a reuben which he said was good.  I tried one of his fries that looked good, but was kind of mushy instead of crispy.  I had a tilapia which was served encrusted with some type of nut (pecans maybe, don't quite  recall).  It was cooked perfectly and quite frankly a little too big for a lunch portion.  Served with a nice tasty rice pilaf and some green beens.  This was good, but heavier than I would have liked with the topping on the fish.  Overall this place does fish quite well.  The dinners are a bit overpriced, but again it is a franchise.  This is a perfectly suitable option in the south side works.",

I had an ahi tuna skewer. It was ok - not much flavor. The stir fried vegetables were very salty. My friend order salmon cakes but a different salmon dish arrived.

The post both menus outside and there is a big up charge for the same food if you come for dinner.  They do have WiFi but you need to get the \"code\" in order to use it. They do not validate parking like some other restaurants in this area.  My girlfriend had the seafood trio which she enjoyed and they gave her a free dessert. They were offering a chef's special Sun-Thurs evenings for $24.99 which includes a choice of soup or salad, entree, and dessert. I opted for that one and settled for the breaded tilapia with sweet potato cous cous. and green beans. There were only flakes of sweet potato in it.  The meal is served with bread and there was plenty to eat. Our waiter was busy with other tables so it took long to get refills on our beverages but other than that it was good.  I learned that if you are an AARP member you can present your card and save 10% off your check. When we got our check it didn't have that discount and my whole meal was broken up in charges instead of one bundle. Took a while to get it straightened out but we managed.  Again I will visit this place if I find the need to. My preference is lunch since you can get most of the same items a lot cheaper.",

The happy hour menu from 5-7 features a solid list of starters and entrees all for 9 bucks or less.

We ordered a draft beer and glass of wine from the happy hour list, as well as truffle fries (skip these unless you have a picky eater, very basic), calamari (yum), 6 oysters (still thinking about them) and 6 cocktail shrimp (good size, cocktail sauce was great).          All together it was less than $40 with tip. I'll be there next Thursday to try $2.50 oysters Rockefeller. The staff here are very nice and my only complaint is that they may have been slightly understaffed.

    "text": "I know McCormicks and Schmicks is a chain of seafood restaurants.  I know that I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain restaurant.  Yadda, Yadda, Yadda!  However, any restaurant that offers food at certain higher price points should deliver food that taste better their fast food/casual dining counterparts.  Thus, my dilemma after a recent visit to McCormicks and Schmicks .  This wasn't my first time at the rodeo.  Generally speaking, I love all things seafood.  (Sea squirts and things of that ilk, I'll leave to Andrew Zimmern)  But shrimp, crab, lobster and catfish are some of my personal faves.  I know that this sounds greedy for just three people, but we ordered the Shrimp Kisses, Coconut Shrimp, Fried Stuffed Mushrooms appetizers; Buttermilk Fried Shrimp, Cashew Crusted Tilapia with Jamaican Rum Butter and Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac & Cheese\" for entrees on this particular occasion.  The Shrimp Kisses and Fried Stuffed Mushrooms were tasty.  However, the Coconut Shrimp and Buttermilk Fried Shrimp had batters that were too heavy and somewhat rubbery.  During other visits, the Buttermilk Fried Shrimp had a much lighter crust.  Who knows what was going on in the kitchen that day?    I say this because my daughter Muff ordered the Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac & Cheese\" for an entree and it was served sans the shrimp and Andouille sausage.  Once we pointed this out to our server, she said that that was kid's Mac & Cheese and a kid received the Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac & Cheese\".  The Cashew Crusted Tilapia with Jamaican Rum Butter was also tasty.  Our server also vacillated between being very attentive and missing in action...  Okay...   So, I don't know if this was an off day or what... But inconsistent food quality, inconsistent service, inconsistent food preparation can kill a restaurant.  All of the McCormicks and Schmicks that I have been to have had a nice \"clubby\" feel and that's perfectly fine.  But, the food and service really need to be tightened up a little and the menu should probably be updated.  Better quality everything should be expected at the prices that they charge.  All I could think about was Donna Summer's \"She Works Hard For the Money\" lyric that says \"So you better treat her right!\".  I didn't get \"right\" treatment and I work hard for my money!.",

Although my swordfish was good, my husband had steak & lobster that he was not happy about to say the least.   Thought there was something wrong with the lobster not being cooked right.  Well I guess he was right because several hours later he was very sick.   Onto dessert ...  I got the chocolate truffle cake.  It was good until half way through there was paper in it !!!  My husband had some type of pecan pie that was still frozen in the middle !  Will never ever go back.",

The lobster bisque should be served with baby aspirin it is so rich creamy and chunky with lobster ..... worth clogging your arteries.  If  you have never eaten fresh lobster ORDER it here .... they will even clean it in the kitchen for you.  I love the king salmon.  The staff are very knowledgeable about the menu and willing to alter order to meet dietary needs.  The warm bread made onsite is addicting.  You can't just have one slice.  Order the apple pie for dessert ... it comes with Dave & Andy's cinnamon ice cream.  Alex is my favorite waiter.",

Our waitress was very nice and she was training a nice young man. My husband and I copied the agree on appetizers so we ordered salads. My husband had the Caprese salad. It had heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella slices, fresh herbs, and some swirls of balsamic vinegar. It was wonderful!!  I had the Chopped salad without the tomatoes. It had bacon, blue cheese, green olives, and a white balsamic dressing. It was one of the best salads I've ever had. I would go back just to eat that salad.  I ordered the Ultimate Grill for dinner. It was scallops, crab stuffed shrimp, grilled shrimp, and a portion of salmon. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The scallops were cooked perfectly as was the grilled shrimp and grilled salmon. I'm usually not a fan of stuffed shrimp because the stuffing usually isn't good but this was amazing. The stuffing was mostly crab. I definitely cleaned my plate! The hubby ordered the Shrimp Triolgy. It had Shrimp Scampi, Stuffed Shrimp, and Fried Shrimp. It came with green beans and squash risotto. He enjoyed the Stuffed Shrimp as much as I did. The Fried Shrimp was very lightly battered and crispy. He wouldn't share the Shrimp Scampi so you know that was his favorite. LOL. I didn't think I would like the squash risotto but it was very good. The squash wasn't squishy which I really liked my hubby's plate was cleaned as well.  Fantastic food and fantastic service. A perfect dining experience.",

My party of two arrived just after 6pm on a Monday to a mostly empty restaurant.  Our friendly server approached within a few minutes, but the time in between drink order...drink...meal...check was lengthy to say the least. Not a huge deal, but what is a huge deal is that the mussels I ordered were awful. At $7 I wouldn't usually complain, but that was exactly $6 too much (I'll give $1 for the half-slice of bread). For those of you that have had gross mussels they're the WORST. I expected more from a seafood restaurant.  Bummer.",

    "text": "I went here recently for a bachelorette dinner, and the night started on a high note: our party of 13 was seated quickly and we were all pleased to see \"Congratulations Tiffany!\" at the top of all our menus!  Unfortunately, that was about the only thing that was remarkable about this place. We started out with 4 servers - 2 seasoned employees and 2 new employees that they explained were shadowing them.  This created a little bit of confusion when ordering drinks and dinner because we weren't sure who to order from!  Our drinks came quickly: I ordered the Raspberry Mule and was underwhelmed -- too much ice in the glass. I probably only got 5-6 sips out of my drink before it was gone and transformed into a glass of water.  The caravan of servers was back soon after to take our orders.  I debated between a couple of items, but ended up settling on the Seared Ahi Tuna -- seared tuna is one of my favorite dishes and I was looking forward to a nice tuna steak! Unfortunately, what I got was more like the ahi tuna appetizer at Outback.  There were about 10 very thinly sliced pieces of tuna on the plate, with a tiny (and I mean like, maybe 1/4 cup) serving of sticky sushi rice and a tiny serving of seaweed & cucumber salad.    The cost for this appetizer-worthy dish? $27.99.  I was honestly appalled and disappointed that I paid so much for so little. I could go to Wholey's and get myself a couple of nice tuna steaks for the same price!  I noticed that the other dishes that our table got were a little more fairly-sized for the price, however this was the first time I've been to a restaurant and really felt ripped off.  They'd be better off moving this dish to the appetizer menu and cutting the price in half.  I don't see how they can justify the price for such a small portion.  While a few others in our party ordered dessert, I decided to get a coffee. They brought it out almost immediately, but with no cream.  Remember how I said we had 4 servers earlier?  Well now, suddenly, POOF! There was no one around.  And the restaurant was about 3/4 empty at this point.  I waited probably 8 minutes before finally grabbing a server and asking for cream.  Minor detail, but I would think that a dish of cream would be standard when serving coffee.    I want to come back to this place for their happy hour, I've heard its AMAZING. But if I ever find myself back here for dinner, I'll be sure to order something a little more meal-worthy.   My total bill for 1 cocktail, 1 beer, 1 coffee and 1 entree:  $50.06 (before tip)",

The food menu is not your average bar food, and all of it is under 10 bucks, including seafood. The burger has been made the way requested, not over/under done. For $5 you get an average sized burger, patty was actually thick when I think about it, and it comes with fries and a pickle. Not bad! considering you get the same meal at a McD's but this one's much better quality. The beef carpaccio, now that's a steal and it's superb. Have also had the mussels, tuna, calamari, and it's all been delicious. The drinks are made well, and are also under 10 bucks. For a cocktail?! can't beat that. We usually sit at the bar, so service is not an issue. The restaurant is spacious, as is the bar area, so you won't feel cramped. They have tv screens showing sports or CNN. The background music is usually upbeat, dance (on that trendy side) without being obnoxious. I've mainly gone at the beginning of happy hour, it's not been crowded at that time, can't say how it is after. Their happy hour is 7 days a week, not just M-F, love that! Hours and menu are on their website. The location is great, being near shops, a movie theater, and other restaurants if you want to hop around, or walk along the waterfront or catch an outdoor concert. If you're in the mood for a nice, finer type happy hour, this is a good option.",

We were about to spend $100 and waiting 20 minutes to be formally greeted other than water is uncalled for. With a $100 check the server should receive $20 tip. I refused to pay a server that nice of a tip and have to sit there and wait.  We went to our local pub and ordered apps good and multiple beers.

    "text": "The food was okay but the service was smidge lack luster.  I'm not from the area and me and a friend came here. We asked to be seated and then the hostess asked us if we had reservations and we didn't so she asked us if we were there for happy hour. After we responded no she said \"are you sure\". I felt offended by this. On top of that, I didn't feel very welcome. I felt like because I wasn't dressed the same as everyone else that they were judging and staring at me. The biggest thing that bothered me is the fact that the only available option of drinks was alcoholic and they didn't have any other drinks besides water. It was offensive to me because I don't drink due to the abundance of alcoholism in my family. Just wasn't that satisfied. Probably wouldn't go back.",

Our server was very new, not familiar with upscale dining, but very nice and sincerely committed to our service. The food, a wedge salad, fried shrimp, and shrimp scampi was all very good. The wine list is a somewhat shrunken version of the list from a year ago, but adequate nonetheless. The dining room has been redone and is pretty attractive now. Overall the experience was much better than the last few times and we will likely return.",

But now they are no longer associated with Landry's and the quality is improving.  I went in for a quick lunch and sat at a table in the bar. The bartender was very friendly and provided excellent service. I had the small portion sea bass. It was delicious and a fine size for lunch. The edamame and mushrooms served with it were very flavorful.   I look forward to trying this location again.",

My husband chose the McC's seafood trio meal,  Stuffed shrimp, Fried shrimp, Salmon mashed potatoes and veg.  He loved the salmon. The best he's ever tasted.  I ordered the Crab Legs which came with roasted potatoes.  The legs were cut in half so it made it very easy to eat. 3 full legs gave me plenty of meat. They were delicious! I would have preferred the mashed potatoes over the roasted.  We finished the meal with a fabulous Creme Brulee.  Our server, Richard, was great. Everyone was really friendly, from the Hostess to the Manager, who stopped by to check on things and remove our very empty dishes.   We always enjoy strolling around the South Side Works after a delicious meal on a beautiful Pittsburgh evening.  We'll be back again soon.",

This visit was a celebration for my mother who LOVES seafood, we shared a few appetizers and dinners.   We sat at the bar and had wonderful service by Tim & Tom, the bartenders were spectacular and the food was below average.   Our seared tuna appetizer had an excessively fishy flavor and was retuned to the kitchen, the jumbo lump crab tower was gray crab which had an aged flavor my wife's crab legs were very hard to crack and peel as they appeared freezer burned. The fried shrimp were perfect & the easiest preparation item.    We Will not be returning to this location.",

However, I feel that the South Side location is often times overlooked. I went here on a Saturday evening. While the wait for The Cheesecake Factory was two hours long, McCormick and Schmicks barely had half the dining room filled.   While any of the seafood dishes I've gotten were great, one dish I wouldn't recommend is their Filet Mignon. We ordered it during our last visit and it was tiny and overcooked; I wondered how they even let it leave the kitchen because it looked like a piece of charcoal.   The food and service here are rather consistent and the space is very large. Come here if you love seafood.",

Then a manager took control and put the order in while I waited at the bar. The bartender didn't say a single word--didn't offer water or a drink as I waited. That was rude. On to the food...the scampi is good. Well seasoned, not overly oily or buttery as most Scampis are, and a healthy portion of jumbo shrimp. Some believe the price is high, but at $23 I think it's priced about right. Maybe they could add bread or something, however I don't think they're known for fresh bread anyway. All in all I would definitely order t again.",

Crab cake sandwich with fries.( huge sandwich with home made pickles and seasoned fries) and shrimp scampi( generous portion of shrimp on top of linguini noodles). Everything from the sourdough bread to the entrees were served to order and hot). The atmosphere was great and we even had the chocolate basket for dessert.

Although the sparse wait staff was welcoming and friendly, the food was a gross disappointment. The shrimp cocktail was not deveined and the crabcake was not fresh. The beer battered fish and chips were the quality one might find in the freezer case of a discount grocery store. The perch and crabmeat entree special was overcooked and tasteless, as were the mushy brussel sprouts that came with it -- well overpriced at $36 for the entree. My husband's scotch and soda initially was delivered as scotch and water -- when the correct drink was delivered it came with an explanation that the bar equipment was not functioning and could not produce soda -- so they had to use the soda pop fountain to make his drink. I frequently take business clients to lunch at the McCormick and Schmick's downtown -- thankfully, it is a world apart in terms of food quality. Sad that this location has gone so far downhill. We will not be returning.",

He had water glasses filled and food on the table before we got to our second rounds of drinks. He not only was prompt, funny and attentive, he was beyond thoughtful.  He asked the chef to bring out one of their banana fosters dishes on the house! He said that when your having a bad day, you just always need something to make you feel better. I truly cannot say how amazing Thomas was that made this Friday, experience and happy hour, one of the most memorable!   This restaurant was a great experience and can not wait to return.

We started off with the stuffed mushrooms, which were very enjoyable.  The sauce is creamy and it was stuffed with plenty of crab. I had the beef with twin lobster tails and my companion had the swordfish and shrimp moqueca.  We enjoyed both of our dishes.  The lobster was good but didn't wow me. The sauce for the beef medallions was nice and was done perfect to my specifications. The grilled veggies was a nice accompaniment. The curry coconut broth for the Moqueca was lovely, reminded me slightly of a Thai dish but very tasty nonetheless.  The sauce was easily sucked up with bread.  The chocolate bag was the hit of the night.  It's huge for one person so be sure to share!",

We were the only two at the bar. She then proceeded to badmouth customers that were there that did not leave her a good tip because they obviously did not have a good experience, no surprise there!! My husband then said, \" What happened? \"You had a bad night?\" She said, \"what?\" he said, \"well it sounded like you were having a bad night because the way you were talking to that guy you were complaining about a table that you had.\" She said, \"Yes well it takes all people\". She then retracted and tried to appear somewhat amused... we however were not, our experience had already been ruined!!   Writing this review because I want for Jenn to understand that you just never know who is watching and listening. it is important for every customer to have a pleasant experience despite what your experience has been at the last table.   We will not return. :(",

Absolutely terrific night and the staff were made sure that is was indeed excellent. Nicole our server was perfect, the manager greeted us and they even beautifully printed our daughters occasion on the menus.   Service was absolutely  top notch with an explanation given of many of the dishes since it was our first time. A lovely menu with a nice body of wine, and delicious entrees. Both the meats and seafood were all done perfectly and of our group of over a dozen there were rave reviews all around.  At no time (on a otherwise busy night) did our group feel rushed. Appetizers, main course, and desserts were top of the line. I highly recommend the bourbon-glazed salmon along with the upside down apple pie.  The food was terrific and the whole experience was a definite 5 star. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I took my family to this restaurant to celebrate my daughters graduation from the University of Pittsburgh. Reservations was at 9:15 pm. Instantly when we walked in we were told that due to graduation that out reservation was going to be backed up. Just by looking at the tables I would say the were 60% full. So we went to the bar area to have drinks. No problem. We finally got seated around 9:30. The first thing our waiter said was he would only take out drink and appetizer order since the kitchen was backed up. So we ordered drinks then felt appetizers were needed because who knows when we were allowed to order our meals. Dining room at this point was 30% full. The water brought out bread and butter. We all helped ourselves to that. My first bite into the bread and butter I realized it was not butter. It was cream cheese. Yuck! I stopped the waiter and asked for butter. He said that is all they had. Are you kidding me!  Out comes the appetizers. Oysters, seared ahi tuna and stuffed mushrooms. Oysters were minuscule. Stuffed mushrooms were cool to the touch. Seared ahi tuna very good. The waiter kept pushing the freshly flown in fish selections. My son and I ordered the same dish. Mahi Mahi with andouille sausage. The worst fish fish ever. Fish was extremely over cooked. The sausage was small pieces that were whipped in our mashed potatoes. Fish was dry as a bone. Many times I had to stop eating in hopes that I could swallow what I just ate. It was that dry and over cooked. Best part of my $38.00 dollar dish was the spinach. Go figure. After spending over $350.00 for a for 6 plus tip was over $400.00.  Money for great service and value-- no problem. After dinner the consensus was we will never go back to this place again. Daughter will graduate in two years with a masters from Pittsburgh and I guarantee the celebration dinner will not be at this restaurant.",

We arrived early and upon going to the bar it took far too long to get an order in and even longer for the drinks to arrive. The bartender would take a drink order and then disappear into the lounge area to accommodate her tables, leaving us waiting. This trend of waiting for things continued throughout the evening. We were gracious enough to delay our reservation time so the restaurant could accommodate another large party, but it didn't help us at all. Drinks to the table took absolutely forever (a family member went to investigate to find them sitting on the bar), trying to get our order taken was painful, and we had to repeatedly ask for items. After everything came several of the entrees were less than impressive and we had to essentially clear the table for ourselves by stacking plates at the end of the table. Despite the fact that it was a Saturday the restaurant was essentially empty except for us and the private dining event, and now I know why. The manager did come to the table but was unable to reconcile our displeasure about the various glaring issues.",

    "text": "We enjoyed Christmas dinner here this year.  Not many restaurants are open, so we were excited to be able to dine here.    First off, McCormick & Schmick is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was an uber cool, high end fine dining experience.  In reality, it's merely a 1/2 step above Red Lobster.  When we arrived, the lobby was jammed packed.  We were seated approximately 30 minutes after our reservation time.  We were lead to a table smack dab in the middle of a high traffic area.  We protested.  BJ always requests a romantic booth for two.  So after standing in the middle of the restaurant ackwardly for 5 or so minutes, we were finally taken to such a table.      Service was friendly from Val.  BJ got a Sierra Nevade brew and I ordered a festive beverage from the cocktail menu.  My Poinsettia was sweet beyond belief and tasted sort of like perfume.  We shared a chopped salad which was fairly good.  We also shared a crab tower, which was nice.  But we have had a similiar type appetizer at Bahama Breeze that is SO much better.  BJ wanted to be different, so he had mussels and the clam steamer for his meal.  He liked his choice and said it was okay.  I wanted to be different, too.  So, I had the lump crab cake with southewest jicama slaw and poblano cream.  I was quite put off with the appearance of my dish.  I didn't care much for the brightly color cream slopped on my plate and the slaw was down right nasty.  The crab cake was alright.  For dessert, we pondered our choices.  Nothing sounded very special, but our server was all about the carrot cake.  Surprisingly, it was the best part of our meal.",

I wasn't feelin' the fish during my recent visit, so I selected the walnut and greens salad followed by the roast chicken.  The salad hit the spot, with lots of blue cheese, candied walnuts and spring greens.  The bread brought to the table was warm and delicious.  The half roasted chicken was presented on a bed of mashed potatoes and spring vegetables (yellow squash and zucchini) and was perfectly cooked.  The potatoes sopped up all of the meaty juices from the chicken, which made them extra delicious.  When I visited, the bar area was hopping, so those happy hour specials that people keep mentioning in other reviews are probably worth checking out.  However, my sole goal was to eat, not drink.  I've found M&S to be  one of those chains that you can pretty much rely on no matter what city you're in, especially if you're a seafood lover.",

    "text": "Corporate accounts only. I took my partner here on a monday night for bday dinner. I was hoping for a nice fancy seafood place above and beyond the ol RB exp. The place is very nice inside, we were seated at a nice booth, the waitress was really good and came to check on us almost too much. Calimari app was pretty good - reminded me alot of the stuff they serve at that italian olive place. For entree I ordered the glazed salmon with mashed potates and green beans and my partner ordered the scallops and spinach over sweet potatoes.  The salmon was real good- it had crispy edges and an almost carmelized glaze, kinda small, but cooked just right. The rest of my meal sucked. I could tell that the beans were previously frozen. They were crunchy almost uncooked and covered in oil. Same story with the mashed potatoes - premixed prob frozen and reheated to the point they were almost gummy. Towards the end our waitress disappaered even though there were only two other tables. We sat and waited for her for some time before we could request the check. Overall,  I was really disappointed in what i got compared to what i paid. I could have easily spent as much money at another place and gotten more, much better quailty food. If you have a company credit card and you're looking to woo potential clients then maybe this is the place for you. Make someone else pay for substandard overpriced food . YMMV.",

I'd have to say it was a typical McCormick's lunch experience - great service, good to great food at very reasonable prices given both the quality of food and service/experience.   Here's the lowdown on the grub: -calamari - somewhere between good to great -Walleye (on the lunch menu) - pretty good -Trout (on the dinner menu) - exceptional -Filet - pretty good for a seafood joint -Apple Cobbler Dessert - only place in the world I eat Cobbler b/c it's really good here  As usual, I recommend McCormick's for lunch 4 star, really recommend their happy hour (5 star) and would pass as a dinner choice (3 star).",

The positives: The food was very good, fresh, and perfectly prepared. Nothing earth-shattering, just good seafood. The negatives: There are too many tables packed into this restaurant. At any given time, you are sitting less than 2' away from another person. It's almost impossible to walk through the restaurant without making the difficult decision posed in Fight Club: ass or crotch.",

No bread was brought to the table although it was to ever other table in the establishment it seemed. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted chicken which comes with linguine alfredo...which amounted to about 4 bites of pasta. The food came out cold. For the money you are much better off going to the Cheesecake Factory, which is where my wife and I were going to go until we found out the wait was over an hour. The best part of the meal was the shrimp kisses appetizer. At least those were good. Will not go back. Have been to other McCormick's throughout the country and this one is definitely subpar.",

    "text": "A Happy Hour Gem! I came down here to catch their Happy Hour on a Monday night before heading to a movie. What a selection they have for both food and drinks, all at great prices.   To start off with we had the spinach dip and potato skins. The multi-color chips were plentiful and complimentary to the dip that was both creamy and cheesy. Yum. Could have passed on the potato skins; even though they had a bit of cheese and bacon on them and a sprinkling of scallions, the only flavor that stood out were the potato and scallions. Still, a bargain at two bucks for 2.   I also had the $2.95 cheeseburger. Pretty decent size ( a half pounder) and well cooked as long as I order it a temp below my desired temperature to compensate for overcooking.   The beef confit sliders were tasty and tender but slathered with too much of their 'asian BBQ sauce'. Next time I will be sure to get it on the side.   Lastly the salmon cakes were really fishy tasting. No apple or fennel flavors as described on the menu, so that was kind of disappointing.   While I didn't order any drinks from their happy hour drink list, they had 3 different wine selections, 2 cocktails and 1 Blue Moon Seasonal draft selection. I applaud it merely for the variety of drink options.    I have yet to try anything on their dinner menu, but I am looking forward to doing it soon :)",

We asked again and was told everyone's is taking long tonight.  We said we were leaving and the waitress offered to THEN get the manager.  I waited for her for ten minutes at the hostess table while she carried on a laughing conversation with another table and then literally walked right past me .... Got tired of being ignored and the waiting game so I explained myself to the hostess and walked out the door....another table was right behind us.  Another table was complaining to the hostess that they waited just as long and their meals were not edible.

    "text": "I never get tired of seafood. Fresh crab, lobster, and halibut are some of my favorites. My favorite fish by far is Chilean sea bass- its best prepared pan-seared with natural jus, or a bit of citrus buerre blanc. My second favorite fish is salmon; I really enjoy the subtle sweetness and soft texture of the meat.  I've been to a lot of different seafood restaurants in and around town, but somehow, McCormick and Schmick's had eluded me- until now. I had the opportunity to have lunch at the seafood restaurant in the Southside Works, and let me tell you, it was delicious.  The entry-way (where that bar is located) was clean and spacious- probably a great place for a happy hour excursion, or colleague-meeting after work. Besides being expansive, the bar-area was impeccably clean.  When our party arrived, we were seated in a large, empty (it was 2:30 in the afternoon) dining room. Our booth was very comfortable, and I was impressed with the spotless glassware, white tablecloths, and linen napkins.  Our waitress, Natasha approached our table with a smile, and went over some of the menu items.  I chose a lunch salad to start, with candied walnuts, mixed greens, blue cheese crumbles, and balsamic vinaigrette ($7.50). We also ordered the Lump Crab Tower ($12.95) with mango, avocado, and orange vinaigrette. Other appetizers included Coast to Coast Tuna ($14.95), Shrimp Kisses with Jack Cheese and Bacon ($11.95), and a Lump Crab Cake with Fire Roasted Corn Salsa ($13.95).   My salad was tasty- the lettuce fresh and cold. The candied walnuts and blue cheese were a great combination. The sweet, zesty vinaigrette woke up my taste-buds. The lump crab tower looked like an edible piece of art; ripe, succulent pieces of mango coupled well with large, sweet chunks of crab and oily, ripe avocado.  Entrees  I opted for a piece of grilled salmon. It was served simply with blanched green beans, whipped potatoes, and citrus butter ($13.95). I ordered my fish medium, and it came perfectly cooked and piping hot. The beans were bright green, well-season, and al dente. The potatoes were bursting with flavor, and had a delicious creamy, buttery, texture. I had a chance to sample the Salmon with Rigatoni, Asparagus, Mushroom, and Artichoke dish ($13.95). Large ribs in the rigatoni caught the rich, pesto-cream sauce. The moist salmon and differing textures in the veggies made for a mouthwatering pasta dish. Although I didn't get to taste the Salmon over Orzo with Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto ($14.95), and Cedar Roasted Atlantic Salmon with Northwest Berry Reduction and Roasted Veggies ($14.95), they looked equally tasty. Other entrees on the lunch menu include Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac and Cheese\" ($12.95), Blackened Chicken Linguini with Mushroom, Peppers and Cajun Cream Sauce ($11.95), and Crispy fish Tacos with Cilantro Aioli ($10.95).  Rarely do I have a meal in a restaurant when everything is truly outstanding. On this particular day, our food was cooked perfectly, and we received stellar service.  Kudos to McCormick and Schmick's for running such a tight ship... I'll be back for another great meal soon!  Chef Chuck Kerber",

We had Cashew Crusted Tilapia and a Perfect Combination [my combo:Crab Cake - Ahi Tuna] The tilapia was fresh and tasty. The crab cake was good, but smallish. The first piece of tuna was over cooked, but the waiter quickly replaced it with one that was perfectly seared and was excellent.  The tuna portion was also a little on the small side. However $22 for a crab cake and a piece of Ahi tuna is reasonable. Butternut Squash Orzo was a welcome side to the perfect combination. Maybe my 3 star review is a reaction to the presentation of the food. Crab cake/Tuna/Orzo/Veggies did not 'fill' plate, no garnish...seemed empty. Four parts floating on white porcelain rather than connected and presented as a whole-  Have eaten at many M&S in many cities through business trips and the food is consistently well prepared. No different here on the South Side.",

    "text": "It feels upscale.  You get the sense that it's \"fine dining\" or, at least, fresh-made food served by people who care.    Um, no.  My wife and I stopped for lunch at M&S today after business on the South Side.  Relatively empty, even at 12.00n.    The server was pleasant and attentive enough. I appreciated his solid service.  I ordered a caesar salad and the fish and chips.  My wife ordered a mixed green salad and the trout.  The romaine lettuce is my salad was turning brown at the edges and I found only TWO croutons, neither of which had any garlic flavor (though promised on the menu. Clearly the lettuce was days old.  My wife's salad has several rotten (not just brown but rotten) pieces of greens.  How hard (and expensive) is it to serve FRESH salads?  The fries (chips) on my plate were cold, even though they were UNDER the fish.  I had barely a tablespoon of tartar sauce for the healthy portion of fish that I was served.  The fish was good.  I also received a small (half-cup or so) of cole slaw that was one step from frozen.  Like the salads, obviously days old.  Nothing on my wife's plate, not the trout, the green beans or the pasta, was seasoned at all. Very bland and tasteless.    VERY disappointing.  And I suspect that the server knew this because when he cleared the entrees he asked \"Can I get you anything else?\" and NOT \"How was lunch?\"    Not that I'm cheap, but my wife turned back the salad without eating but a bite-full yet the waiter made no effort to take it off the bill.    VERY disappointing.  $50 for lunch.  Thank God we had a $50 gift card.  I was out only the $10 for the tip.",

Our reservation was honored and we were seated in a booth. My seat was quite wet, so the hostess had to get a towel and dry the seat before I could sit down. The seats were pushed so close to the table that it was quite uncomfortable. We weren't able to push the seat back because other customers were seated at the table behind us. After waiting for nearly 15 minutes, we were greeted by our server. He was pleasant and knowledgeable of menu offerings. The server promptly served us water and fresh bread. We then realized that we didn't have any napkins. After waiting for more than 5 minutes for our server to return, I finally asked the hostess for napkins. She retrieved them and apologized. My dining partner ordered fish & chips. He said it was very good, except it was a bit greasy. I ordered the fried shrimp. It was piping hot when served, but it, too, was a bit greasy. Our used plates and silverware were not removed from the table until we were presented with our check. We were properly thanked by our server.",

    "text": "When you've made mutilple visits to a dining establishment you expect the level of service you receive to be about equal.     I have bi-polar dining experiences with McCormick and Schmicks. My first ever time there the waiter was charming, funny and attentive he brought me extra breakdand lemon wedges upon request. The sauce that the garlic mussels in was so good I had to finish all of it, long after the mussels where gone.  After eating the crume brulee I obsessed over it for days.The ambience of the resturant on that date created a romanctice mood.  I have also made several trips in between the first and last time.   However on my very last  visit I took my younger sibling to a breakfast buffet here.  It was disgusting I was T.O at the garbage they were feeding to these little kids.  The plates were dirty,  and everything had a refrigerated taste even the pasties. My heart breaks that any establishment would serve nasty left overs to children.  Needless to say McCormick and Schmicks at least in SouthSide works is now on my do not dine list.",

I explored the extensive menu and came to the choice of almond crusted rainbow trout.  The trout was fantastic and the sides were different and exquisite.   The staff was attentive and friendly.  The knocks on this restaurant would be the portion sizes and the price.  Overall nice experience though.",

    "text": "My friend and I had dinner here on a Friday night, and we chose to sit at the bar. Jen was our bartender and she took very good care of us. We started with the coast to coast tuna which was a nice take on an Ahi tuna 2 ways (seared and tartare). I had the caesar salad with anchovy as my salad course. The salad was amazing, I will say that they gave me way too many anchovies and I had to remove some, but no harm done there. For our main course, I had the scallops and my friend had the filet mignon. I was very impressed with the scallops - they were out of this world! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a nice sear on the outside and slightly transparent in the middle. The potato crab hash was a great accompaniment as well! My friend gave me a bite of his steak and it was also cooked exactly as he requested - medium rare with a nice warm red center. All in all, we had a great experience and it was nice that the manager, Amanda, stopped by and said a few nice words just to make sure we were completely enjoying our dining experience! Kudos to McCormick & Schmick's!",

    "text": "I have eaten at the Downtown location on several ocassions thanks to different business meeting.  Going on my own dime was timed to Happy Hour accordingly.  This particular location (Southside Works!) is easily spot-able from the street and the bar area while a tad crammed still felt welcomed.  This review is strictly based on a bar-seating and Happy Hour Pricing experience, so take it with a monetary grain of salt.  Drink specials were out of this Universe.  The quality of the drinks made, the grade of the liquors used, and the balance between mixers and alcohol was perfect.  I had their Hard Lemonade (which packed a punch!) and the Mellon themed drink.  I did get to sip the Peach Puree feature drink as well.  All three of them were an excellent value at their price brackets and service was super speedy.  On the food front, I still can't get over how cheap their Happy Hour specials are.  You get decent sized portions, Mc&S caliber food, and quick service.  It definitely can't be beat.  While I'm all about trying new places ... next time I'm back in the Southside Works and my friends want to do Happy Hour, this place has my vote, we can always dabble with the dinner or dessert location, haha.",
