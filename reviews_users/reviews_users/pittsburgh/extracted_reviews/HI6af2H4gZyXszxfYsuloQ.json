    "text": "Today was my inaugural visit to Saga. I had heard all good things about this place, and I LOVE sushi, so I was excited to finally try it out.   The interior of this place is beautiful! They have a hibachi section, a large front bar (which I'd assume is a great place to be on a Friday after work), and a main dining area. This is where my friend and I sat for lunch.   I ordered an asparagus and vegetable roll and it came with a salad. I wasn't too fond of the salad or the ginger dressing that came on it. I had two bites and didn't finish it. I probably should have stuck with my original idea of adding a seaweed salad. I'll know for next time for sure to do that.  The asparagus roll was average. The vegetable roll I'd give a B-. There were a lot of Asian vegetables in there that made for an awkward taste. I left half of them on my plate.  I give my rating an A-OK because I'd love to go back and try some of their other rolls. The food overall was good, just not anything I'd order a second time around. It definitely has a great atmosphere and good service that would bring me back there and give it a second try.",

The problem is the horrible service AND management. The same short woman is always there w a smug look on her face and never does anything to make customers happy. We had a large group for my graduation there, literally had to track down the waitress every time we needed anything, and they didn't even bother to apologize! So, since I liked the food but not the service, I started just getting food to go. They even screw that up!!!!!!!!!!!! I waited almost 30-40 last night for 2 sushi rolls. They hadnt even been started when I came back after 20 min like I was quoted. I doubt the hostess (who was in PINK leggings, quite unprofessional!) even put my order in since it hadn't been started. I expressed my unhappiness to the manager and she brushed it off like it was nothing. Customer lost! Id rather get sushi from Giant Eagle than give my money to this place again. so disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope their owner checks these reviews from time to time, they should really know their  business is being ruined by a very poor manager. She is the only one I ever see there so she must be the only one.",

While our cook was fun, the waitress was nothing special. The filet was cut in pieces that were too big. The most disappointing thing was to see a birthday next to us where the staff abandoned the singing of happy birthday halfway through leaving one lone waitress to sing the last two lines. We had two birthdays in our party and decided to skip asking them to sing and leave to have dessert elsewhere.  I don't know what happened to giving a shrimp appetizer with meals either. Overall we way overpaid for a mediocre dinner and a little entertainment. I will stick to Benihana or Ichiban in the future. Quality has never been a let down at those locations.",

After a long hiatus, my friends and I returned to Saga for lunch.  It was VERY busy.  I suppose that should say something about it, and to be completely fair, Friday during lent probably didn't help.  The waitress was polite but overworked, so she spent a lot of time apologizing for how long things were taking.  And for not having napkins.  And for not bringing soy sauce.    The sushi was actually pretty good.  But it's just as good at least two other places within a 2 mile radius, so it'll probably be another long hiatus before my next visit.",

    "text": "Saga Hibachi is one of my favorite places to go. The hibachi chiefs are very funny, and they even poke fun at themselves from time to time. They really go out of their way to engage and entertain the customers. I generally order the Traditional Chicken Hibachi which costs $18. It is served with chicken, rice, noodles, and mixed veggies. As a big-guy, with a big appetite, rest assured that you will have plenty of food on your plate.   This is the first place I have ever ate sashimi. Please note that sashimi is plain raw fish. It is not sushi - it is not wrapped into rolls, mixed with rice, or any of that stuff. It is simply raw cuts of fish. I have become a big fan, especially the tuna sashimi. If you have never tried it, spend the $5 next time you are at Saga.   Great atmosphere, lots of fun. Prices are high, but you get a great deal of food, plus entertainment...so well worth it.   Parking can be a challenge. I usually park BEHIND the restaurant and simply walk through Barnes and Noble to get there.  4 Stars for sure...Great Place!",

Lots of apologies from our server Nikki but no results. I finally asked for the manager. Ray the bartender/acting manager dropped by. More apologies and finally my dinner. He was offering 10% off of the bill for our inconvenience. Any more discount would require the owners approval. They have him the authority to discount by 25%. Ray and Nikki did all that they could. Shame on the non-present owners for the disrespect to their diners. Understaffed and undertrained.",

So we planned to go for hibachi and then across the street to the movies.   We sat down, ate, and it was delicious. No complaints. The drinks, the food, the show. It was awesome.   Then... we went across the street.   I swear to god we sat through the previews and about ten minutes of the movie before I ran to the bathroom and vomited. I also threw up in the car and at home. So did he. It was horrible.  I will say that one of my fiancee's students (he is a teacher) worked at the theater and noticed we were leaving already, told her manager what happened and refunded our tickets so we got to see the movie a few days later! they are awesome!)  Then, when my fiancee called the restaurant they told him we were lying and hung up on us!  I emailed management from their website who told me that they didn't believe their workers would do that and they would look into it. I never heard back.",

    "text": "My one previous experience with hibachi had been good but underwhelming as far as the ambiance of the setting.  I'm not asking for an entirely authentic setting, but there's a few basics that it was lacking.  Enter Saga.  Beautiful setting with three separate sections, the restaurant, the bar, and the hibachi seating section.  Good decorations, clean lines, and clean overall.  The seating felt nice and \"private\" within the realm of hibachi seating.  And the service was good.  The food was the only thing where I found myself going \"eh, meh.\"  In the almost two hours that I was there I head \"Saki time\" or \"More Saki, More Fun\" every ten minutes on the dot--if not more often.  Which is all fine and dandy if you want to drunken the customers and hibachi cooks but keep away from my rice & noodles please.  The portions were huge, which I was expecting and hoping given their pricing schedule.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned while the shrimps were super plump and yummy.  But then ... there was the rice and noodles ... some bites were supper good and some bites all I could muster were flashbacks to \"more Saki more fun\" since that's all I could taste.  Overall it's an solid A-Ok.  I think once I develop a palate(sp) for Saki it wouldn't bother me as much. :-)",

    "text": "Never.  Again.  I can't say that I was particularly enthused when my friend decided he wanted to celebrate his birthday at Saga in Robinson, but I went along with it because it was his birthday pick.  I figured we'd at least have some fun seeing some shrimp getting thrown around and having some saki getting squirted into our mouths.  Unfortunately, our experience there was nothing of the sort.   First, we had a reservation for 7pm and our entire party of 7 people arrived promptly at that time.  We were still stuck standing in the lobby for a good 10 minutes while our table was prepared.  When we finally got seated, our server took our drink orders and returned about 10 minutes later with a tray full of styrofoam cups.  She said that they were in the process of washing some glasses.  Ok  Understandable.  Weird that a restaurant of that size and caliber would not have enough drinkware on hand, but understandable I suppose.  A while later, she took our orders which included a variety of sushi appetizers and seaweed salad.  Those came somewhat promptly, even tough one of my dining companions received a seafood salad instead of his seaweed salad.  After our appetizers, soups and salads came out, that's when the waiting started.  And the waiting.  And more waiting.   It was obvious that *someone* had forgotten about our table.  The barely post-pubescent manager came out and \"apologized\" (without making actual eye contact with anybody) saying that the chef had grabbed the wrong ticket.    We waited over AN HOUR for a Hibachi chef to come to our table and start cooking!  I know that if you order appetizers, your food is obviously going to be slightly delayed while you have those, but an hour AFTER appetizers is just ridiculous.  The only reason I think anybody even ended up coming over was because the people sitting around the grill with us complained that they saw other diners who had come in after us and were already served and leaving the restaurant whilst we were still waiting for our chef.    When our chef finally came out, it was the most blase, boring hibachi 'performance' I had ever witnessed.  I mean, yeah he die flip an egg into his hat and make the grill flame up, but that's about it.  No theatrics, no conversation, just cooking.  If i wanted that, I could have gone literally almost anywhere else and left the cooks in the kitchen.  Finally, when dinner was finished, and the waitress had made about a million excuses as to why everything sucked so bad, I realized that the reason they probably are lacking clean dishes and drinkware is because she hadn't taken any of our dishes away and just kept bringing out fresh glasses.   I had four empty pop glasses in front of me alone.  After a while, someone else started taking everything away.  In the meantime, one of the employee's phones was on the server station behind us and it kept going off making this alarm sound.  It did it no less than three times.    After dinner, that awful birthday song started playing in our section (though it was a reprieve from the incessant phone alarm) and the server brought out this fried ice cream thing to the other people sitting at the grill with us (it was one of their birthday as well).  Ironically after an entire meal of nothing getting taken away, she had no silverware with which to eat this creation.  We mentioned that it was also our dining companion's birthday so they brought out another fried ice cream thing and the awful music started playing again.  What the server failed to mention when bringing out these ice cream creations, was that they CHARGE FOR THEM.  Neither us nor the people sitting with us were aware of that.  Too bad the poor birthday girl didn't even get to try it since she had no damn silverware.  I believe, that came off the bill.   Two hours into the fiasco, it was finally the end, we were pretty unhappy with the entire experience from start to finish.  The manager did give us 15% off, but really, Saga is so overpriced as it is, the small amount we saved because the meal was so bad was not even worth it.   On the way back home to Oakland, I had to make an emergency stop in Greentree because after all of that, the food made me sick!  I can also confirm that at least one other person in our party also go violently ill that night.   Between the horrible service, the boring Hibachi chef, the poor management, the phone alarm that kept going of, the awful birthday music and food poisoning, I will NOT be returning to Saga.  Ever.",

Ordered a few rolls for lunch and also got the hibachi steak and chicken combo. Ginger salad came out absolutely drenched in dressing. Steak and chicken were both diced very small and steak was chewy. Food reminded me of the Chinese food court options at the mall.   At the end of my meal, the bill came and totaled $30. Now I did get some rolls (albeit very basic ones like California roll) but still, this was ridiculous for the food that came. If it had been better quality, then fine I have no problem paying this.

An asterisk indicates an approximate time (though events are in the correct order).  6:58 - Arrive for 7pm reservation  7:01 - Entire party arrives (they only seat complete parties)  7:09 - After 8 minutes of waiting, our party of 7 gets seated at a hibachi station.  7:10 - Another party of 4 gets seated at our table. Both parties are celebrating a birthday; we bond.  7:12 - I marvel at the next table. Looks awesome. Everyone's laughing at the chef's jokes as he flips bits of food through the air into peoples' mouths. Later, I'd note sake-squirting and other fun, interactive tricks.  7:13 - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT  7:16* - Drink and appetizer orders taken. WAITRESS OFFERS ALCOHOL TO TEENAGE GIRL. When confronted with the girl's True age and the lack of carding, waitress gives a giggle-shrug and says \"Oops! Well, you look 21!\" Oh, she LOOKS 21. Then it's fine.  7:18* - Drinks come out in Styrofoam cups. They're out of glassware. No biggie.  7:19* - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT. Also, we place dinner orders (though we kind of have to shout, why is the volume so loud?).  7:30 - Appetizers arrive. One of the three orders was wrong. Someone orders a second beer which never arrives, though it takes a while to figure that one out.  7:33*, 7:35*, 7:40*, 7:42*, and 7:45* - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT. Holy crap, this must be THE place to celebrate a birthday!  7:50 - Still no sign of our hibachi chef. Party that came in more than half an hour after us gets a chef.  8:04 - Someone complains to a waitress. We're getting hungry and rather pathetic looking. The hunger mixed with constant repetitive electronic music has worn down all my emotional defenses. I am psychologically primed for cult recruitment, or a Guantanamo interrogation.  8:07* - BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. An alarm is going off! What does it mean? No staff is in sight. It's too quiet to be safety-related. It sounds like...an alarm clock? I hunt down the noise and find a lone iPhone sitting under a plastic bag. I pick up the offending device and ask whose it is. NOW I've got someone's attention, because a staff member rushes over and says it belongs to a coworker. She scurries off to find said coworker.  8:10* - Kid in a tie comes over and apologizes for the delay without making eye contact. No introduction, so I just *assume* he works there. He says there was a mix-up with their paper ticket system and a chef went to the wrong table. A hasty retreat is beaten by the bearer of bad news.  8:15 - Been sitting without a chef for over an hour. Contemplating leaving, but it's just so amusing th--BEEP BEEP BEEP. There's that iPhone again.  8:20* - Someone finally notices two paid checks that have been sitting on our table since we sat down. They, along with some dishes etc. get removed. I'm no logistics expert, but I think I know why they ran out of glasses and had to use Styrofoam.  8:25* - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT  8:39 - A chef today! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! Rejoice this way!  8:39 to 8:43 - Chef performs uninspired and perfunctory hibachi show. No throwing food in mouth. No jokes or laughter. No squirting of sake or tossing of shrimp. He bounces an egg on a spatula for a few seconds and then stores it in his hat. Awkward and boring.  8:44 - Chef starts dumping food on our plates. Show's over, he's just cooking now and ignoring us completely. My mouth hangs open--mostly from stunned disappointment, but in part out of some naive hope that a shrimp is coming its way. No such luck. If I want food in my mouth, I'm going to have put it there myself. Like a sucker.  8:45 - We all eat quickly. Food's unremarkable; mine's a little overcooked. Too hungry to care. It's been over an hour and a half since we sat down.  8:50* - The birthday girl in the other party gets a treat! They bring out some fried ice cream just for her! ELECTRONIC MUSIC, OBVIOUSLY.  I point out that it's my friend's birthday too, so they go off to find another dessert.  8:51* - After a solid minute of confusion, the birthday girl gives up on her treat. Why? No utensils.  8:56* - MORE MUSIC, and my friend gets ice cream. Still no utensils. He uses a fork.  9:02 - Checks arrive. We found the missing beer! It's on the bill.  9:03 - Hey, wait a second. Why are the birthday treats no one ordered on the bill? They charge people having birthdays for stuff that comes out automatically. Not cool.  When the dust cleared, they took 15% off the bill. I still felt pretty disappointed and ripped off.  Oh, and 2 out of 7 people got food poisoning later that night. Don't order steak.",

    "text": "Maybe the majority of the previous Saga Yelpers were hangry. Maybe the establishment is working to improve its poor wrap. Either way, we had a pleasant dining experience here. A free Groupon deal lured us in the door so, admittedly, my expectations weren't too high but Saga delivered. The food was average hibachi fare equivalent to our usual Ichiban. Every single staff member - the person who seated us, our server, hibachi chef and even the bartender who bid us goodnight - was pleasant and attentive. Our server refilled my husband's drink no less than 4 times (yeah, he's perpetually parched) and the chef did his best to entertain our quiet table of four. We will definitely be back to try their sushi happy hour.",

We were so hungry and Ichiban was closed so we stayed. My steak was cooked medium (I asked for well) and the noodles and rice was just a big YUCK. So disappointed. This was the 3rd time I have been here and have it another shot but now I know I will never come back. I had so much food left over on my plate with the steak all tore in half, you think the server would have asked how things were? Nope. Worst $30 I have ever spent.",

No wait, which was nice, but we were seated and within a minute the guy is there for our drink order ok that's good right? No. He then says you order now the others are waiting. We rush to order. Now we wait. Finally here comes the guy to cook the food! No drinks, soup or salad. The cook just cooked. No entertainment at all. Literally just stood there cooking. Despite the fact that I had three kids there. It was terrible and it wasn't the first time it was terrible. All this disappointment at the bargain price of $107.00 without ordering alcohol or desserts. It was me and 3 kids. Such a shame",

    "text": "Everything is good if not a bit overpriced.  The restaurant is very clean (I look for this if they serve up raw fish!) and the service is always very efficient but a bit on the cold and perfunctory side.    My go to items here are: Signature roll - basically tempura shrimp roll with fish roe and shrimp salad on it.  It's a goofy item but it always hits the spot.  Tuna sushi - very nice serving of raw tuna on rice.  Hard to complain about this.    Gyoza appetizer - always a crowd pleaser in our family.    As much as I like coming here, I always have to deal with the Teppanyaki operation next door.  Which is a bit of a techno Benihana experience.  Actually, it's a nightmare.  But, it's clearly a crowd pleaser so I'm sure that's why it's kept up by the owners.  The music, the lights, the awful showmanship like squirting Sake into the mouths of the adult patrons lined up around the fry table and shouting goofy stuff like: \"MORE SAKE, MORE SEXY!\" and then singing: \"NA NA NA NA, NA NA NA NA, HEY HEY HEY, SAKE TIME!\"",

    "text": "Today, myself and several of my coworkers called to order lunch from Saga at Settler's Ridge. We are pretty regular customers of the establishment as we all enjoy the sushi roll lunches. Much to my dismay, when I asked to place an order for said lunches, I was told that, since today was a holiday, they were only doing dinner prices all day long. That, in and of itself, is ridiculous.  Yes, today is President's Day but the vast majority of Americans who don't work a government or banking job, it is just another work day. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was given over to some dude who said there was no manager today and he couldn't do anything.   The food here is OK, just OK. The service is bloody awful. Good luck getting out of here on time during your lunch hour. This latest greedy action today pretty much cements that, from now on, I'll go to one of the other sushi places in Robinson like Ichiban or even Market District.   Stay away",

    "text": "Completely disappointed. Normally, we go to Itchiban but tonight I suggested we try out Saga. Thursday evening, place was pretty dead as there was only two other families in the restaurant sitting at different hibachi tables.  They placed our menus down on the corner row of the empty table. I opted to move to the front so my son could see the show better (basically the only reason we came was for his entertainment) after sitting for 5 minutes a waiter came back with waters and placed them in front of the seats we were sitting in. He stated that we could not sit there, and we were to sit on the side, unless they did not get anymore customers at our table, and then we could move to the prime seats.... Okay then. My husband returned back from the bathroom with my son and we sat for another 5 minutes before a group of two came in and opted to sit on the smaller portion to the side. We then sat for another 5 minutes. Not once was I offered to order any appetizers, which we did want to order. At this point, I have been waiting for others to fill our table for 15 minutes.  I ended up walking out. Lack of service and waitstaff dictating where I sit in an extremely dead restaurant. We ended up going to Itchiban. We had our order placed and appetizer order in within the first 5 minutes. I won't be back again.",

We arrived a little early but they seated immediately. Our waitress came and took our drink order and came back with our drinks and tool out app order and sushi order....not a single person came back to us for 45 min. When our waitress did return my friend politely asked about our app and the waitress turned around and snapped that she has a party of 20 and she will get them when she can. I was personally so shocked!!! She came back a minute later with the sushi app that had clearly been sitting for some time. An our after we had been seated we had no drinks and our chef arrived....the chef was awesome and the fabulous bus boy refilled all our drinks. I wish we could have tipped them directly as our waitress was horribly rude and nasty until she gave us our check. We all of course tipped her but were very disappointed in how she treated us, if it wasn't for the rest of the staff we would have most likely left",

I went into this expecting a lot worse than I ended up getting.  (If anything, it was the other parties at our table that were woefully disappointing.  Not a lick of excitement for fire and shrimp among them.)  The \"show\" put on by our chef was pretty par for what you'll find at any hibachi place around the U.S., and he was even one of the peppier ones that I've seen at that.  The food was good, and I paid about what I expected to for steak and scallops.  The no-prices-on-the-drink menu situation was a bit sketchy, however.  Service was efficient, restaurant seemed clean.  Next time I'm craving hibachi grill, I'd like to try a Pittsburgh area restaurant that has a higher rating, just to see if it really is all that much better.",

I was 10 minutes late meeting friends who had already sat and ordered for me. When I got there our server, Jay i believe never even asked me if I wanted a drink. He was so rude and would drop things off and literally just walk away as fast as possible. Never asked how anything tasted, never checked for refills and honestly was really rude with us. When we paid, he ended up bringing back all of ours and directly said to us \"you have to tip more\" then stood there and watched all of us awkwardly dig more money out for his service, staring the entire time. So awkward and literally awful service. Not to mention the sushi wasn't what it usually was. They just didn't care I guess. I'm probably gonna switch to ichiban for a little lol.",

However, I will NOT be going back and I recommend to all yelp-users to go to a different Japanese restaurant! I called ahead about a groupon deal I saw and the manager told me they would give me the discount. Upon arriving at Saga, I wanted to verify the groupon and the man at the front desk told me once again that he would honor the deal. When we received our bill, they did not take off the groupon discount, so I asked a woman about it. She proceeded to tell me that it would not be honored, and that she didn't care. I was talked down to after asking her name and for her manager. I will never go back to this restaurant, I am in complete disbelief at the way that they treated a person who once loved hibachi food. I would give 0 stars if I could!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR YOUR MEAL",

The last time was Friday, my family of 4 had hibachi dinners (although in dining room not at the grill because kids are afraid of the fire). Experience was horrible! It was literally over 20 minutes before our waiter came to get our drink order. The couple that came in after us had their meals on the table before our drinks were ordered. Our meals were good quality but the service or lack there of was disappointing for a meal over $100. The wait was so long that we accidentally broke a soy sauce container that fell off our table onto the floor. The waiter literally came over and stared at it for 15 minutes before a young bus boy came from the back room with a broom/mop and the waiter stopped him from cleaning it until he threw newspaper on it! I swear the waiter seemed high on drugs. Then to top it off the waiter added an \"automatic gratuity\" saying that was their policy for party of 4 or larger. Dining here with always 4 guests sometimes 9 we've never had \"automatic gratuity\". I'm afraid we will not be back with service like this!! Oh and PS-they we not busy. It was off peak time and only 2 other people in dinning room with only 2 grills going.",

    "text": "Suddenly seeking sushi, the weary-eyed travelers stumbled upon this Saga.   If this Saga were a Martini it would contain:   1 part Hibachi 1 part Sushi  1 part TGI Fridays 1 part amateur, dry staff   This martini would be assembled by staff members who were clueless where the reference \"shaken not stirred\" came from.   The biggest problem with this restaurant is the staff. From the hostesses to the waitstaff we're dealing with amateurs here.   The hostesses are in desperate need of customer service training. Too busy to annunciate their words, too busy to welcome you, too busy to smile and too busy to look up from their paperwork; customers are an inconvenience. If they weren't so clueless, I'd teach them to spell the word E-X-P-E-N-D-A-B-L-E.   The waitress was sweet, genuine and efficient. One complaint: I inquired about the size of an appetizer and she attempted to flag down a nearby waiter. With three chefs in sight, the nearby waiter apathetically replied, \"I don't know\" and walked away. The waitress apologized and I ordered something else for the sake of time. Again, the waitress was great, but failed to use the chef as a resource located within feet of her.   The quality and the meal was disappointingly average. Gourmet grocery stores have a similar product when prepared on request and assembled in front of you. If I had nothing else to compare this to, I'd have given Saga a mitigating 3 star rating.   Verdict: Whaddya expect from a chain-resturant? This Saga is to be (dis)continued in my book. Go fish.",

    "text": "Still spending a lot of time here in the Pittsburgh area and have tried almost every spot within a few miles from my hotel.  This place was next on the list.  I came here in the mood for sushi, but we also ended up deciding to sit at the hibachi.     This place looks like just about any other hibatchi place that I have visited, nothing special or amazing sticks out from it.  The music that was playing was pop and some country songs came on. I personally really do enjoy music that is set to compliment the atmosphere, so I was somewhat dissappointed on that front.   We were the only two at out table ( we got there pretty early, right after work) and service was quick and friendly.  I did end up ordering a spicy crab roll that was good enough that we ate it all, but not knock your socks off great.  I ordered steak and chicken, and my friend ordered steak and shrimp.  We got the usual soup and salad that comes before.    The guy who prepared our food was fun and entertaining.  The food was ok, i just think they skimped on the good veggies ( over run with onions, and not so much zucchini), and I asked for no onion, but it was all mixed in ahead of time ( which I don't normally see) , so i got a boatload of onions.  Its ok, I'm not allergic, just don't care for them, so I just picked out what I wanted.   THere was a lot of food. Too much to eat.  I had another meal in leftovers, but couldn't take them back to the hotel due to no fridge or microwave to eat later.  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll only get one meat....     Not sure if I'll come running back here - unless I am in the mood for hibatchi, unless I find something in the area better",

    "text": "We decided to drop in at Saga on a Sunday evening for a family dinner (parents visiting). The place was pretty dead, and the staff took some time to organize which empty table to seat us on. I think they need a dedicated host/hostess at all times (not only during peak hours).  Once we were seated in the Hibachi section, we were met with a great waiter - he kept checking in on us and seemed sincere. The Hibachi chef was a playful dude - did his tricks, cooked some tasty food, sprinkled water on us (to prevent us from heating up near the fire), and tossed veggies and squirted sake (not together) in our mouth. Maybe a little too playful for me but entertaining.   I found the Hibachi food at this place much better (tastier and perfectly seasoned) than some other places I have tried (Ichiban and some other restaurants in LA). The shrimp is my favorite, next is chicken and then steak. My wife tried the salmon and seemed to like it too. All the Hibachi entrees come with noodles, rice, veggies, soup and salad and the portions are big i.e. you do not go hungry and you get food worth the money.   The restaurant is good sized, with a bar and separate seating for Hibachi and Sushi. The interiors look modern and clean.   The last time I was here, I received terrible service as our waitress did not seem like she wanted to be working. Though the sushi was fresh, tasty and ample (Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, Shrimp roll), it spoiled my experience. As my recent experience was a positive one, I will give Saga another chance and hopefully the service can impress me as the food definitely does. The three stars round up for both my visits (service and food).",

The pounding electronic polka was in full effect as was the suburban strain of the much maligned yuppie, but that's a piece of social commentary for another day...  Kay and I began with a quintet of Lobster Rolls, which included tempura lobster, cucumber, avocado, mayonnaise, lettuce, and...caviar (!). I'm not sure why I keep ordering sushi because it all tastes the same to me, unless it's atrocious, and this wasn't in the least, each ingredient adding up to make for a flavorful wad of grains, veggies, protein, and roe. And that's all sushi is; a doughy clump of...whatever-you-can-think-of that's often greater than the aggregate of its elements, isn't it?   Wanting to avoid doing the teppenyaki thing since we weren't feeling sociable and had experienced it before elsewhere, I haphazardly chose the Salmon Katsu for my entree. Not knowing just what in blazes Katsu was, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it primarly consisted of some of the dandiest fish fingers I've had in some time. Coated in a crispy, sweet breading, the filets within were pink, juicy, and fresh. Escorting the fish was a bowl of rice and teriyaki sauce. Nooot bad at all.   To save my salt-of-the-earth ass, I cannot remember what Kay ordered. Our day had been a protracted one, and our week had been bludgeoning, overstimulating.   We did not *sob* order dessert.   Aside from Saga's overly trendy climate, I really have no qualms about our Friday evening meal here.  P.S. The service was satisfactory on our end, and the restaurant was spic-and-span.",

All of the sushi we order is quality, but you should definitely try one of the pricier \"deep fried\" rolls. My favorites are the saga roll or delicious roll.

During the chef cooking,  our waiter was M. I. A.... even though everyone needed refills. He actually didn't show up until everyone was nearly finished & needed boxes.   The price of the meals is ridiculously over priced for what it is.  You can go to a Chinese buffet and get the same thing and then some for MUCH less.   I visited the restroom before we left....

    "text": "Let me start out by stating that I very much enjoy this restaurant as a whole, and have had mostly positive experiences.  That being said, I recently ate at this place and had probably the worst/most bizarre service i have ever had. Our waitress was on drugs. Like super drugs. Not like normal everyday drugs that a person can still function on. I'm talking about the kind of drugs where you apparently can't stand up straight. Hardcore mind-altering drugs. She started out the interaction by telling us that she was actually not a waitress but a bartender so she didn't know what she was doing and told us multiple times before even asking if we wanted anything from the menu that she wanted to go on break. So she told us numerous times that if we didn't see her around it was cuz she was on break somewhere. We started by putting in a sizable order of sushi and then went on to order our meals.  We ended up getting our meals (full hibachi orders) and ate the entire things without ever seeing our waitress again. She didn't refill waters. Didn't check on us at all. We never got the sushi we ordered. It was nowhere in sight. After waiting probably half an hour with no service I had to go find our waitress at the front of house and ask her for our check and to not worry about the sushi since we never got it. She then proceeded to tell us that if we didn't take the sushi that she would end up being stuck paying it and tried to sway us to not take it off the bill. After we nicely insisted that it shouldn't be on the bill because we never received it, she tried to offer us free alcohol as compensation. At no point did she apologize or take responsibility for the bad service.  She ended the interaction by asking if we wanted her to \"sneak some sushi\" to us. Nah. We're all set.  Please run if you go here and get Amanda as a bartender.",

The Hibachi Steak Entree is pretty fantastic.   There was nothing ordinary about it - super flavorful! I had a great experience during my first visit.    Thanks Saga!",

    "text": "We went out on a Tuesday night for a close friends birthday.  We had a Groupon (photo attached) for two meals for $12.  We asked the waitress what all was covered under the Groupon, and she said any adult entree was included. We were with a party of 6, and they said we could use two.  The six of us were crammed in the middle of a table with two other couples on either end.  One of the couples was cool, they interacted with the chef and us and the other party. The other man was a typical yinzer, and continually dropped the 'f' bomb in front of our mixed company.   Three of us ordered the shrimp and steak, and the other three chicken.  The chef was good.  He was personable, interacted with all of us with out being intrusive.  The waitress was a bit huffy, and seemed perturbed that we weren't drinking alcohol. She did keep our glasses fairly full.  Our night took a substantial downward tumble when the bill came. Suddenly, the two meals for $12 became $25 off per groupon.    We questioned the waitress, and she said that though the groupon shows two meals for $12, it was a $25 credit for $12.  We asked to see a manager and a young man named Chris came to the table.  We showed him the groupon, and he said that we had to 'read the fine print.'  We did that with him at the table.  No where did the groupon state that it was a $25 credit for $12.   We asked him who his supervisor was, and he mentioned Stephen Chen.  He was unable to be reached by phone. The 'manager' excused himself and returned after a few minutes.  He said he spoke to Jason, the kitchen manager, and he said that no further discount could be given.  Chris also said that if we didn't pay the bill, they'd call the police.    We never said we weren't going to pay. We just wanted the discount that was advertised on the groupon we purchased.  We reluctantly paid the bill and requested that the 18% gratuity be removed so we could pay it in cash.  The waitress huffed away as the 'manager' rang up the bill.  We asked to speak with Jason the kitchen manager and we were told he would not come out to see us.  Never again, Saga. Bait and switch is an old school sales ploy, and we're on to it.  When I showed the Groupon, live on my phone to Chris, he said 'it doesn't matter what it says, this is what it means....' He also said that what Groupon puts on their site isn't his responsibility....  We found four other groupings that showed exactly what they were (pay $15, get a $40 credit).  Photos attached of those, also.   Finally, there are no lights in the bathroom.... Just a dark blue hue from the men's room. It's like a Miami Vice crime scene.  These hibachi restaurants are a dime a dozen.  Pick. Different one.",

This place is local to us and while its not the best sushi joint around it does have a decent noodle dish: chicken soba.   Decent because it is flavorful even though the noodles aren't soba noodles; the noodles are your typical ramen style.  But, aside from the False labeling, it is the only item I have ordered from the small selection of cooked items not from the Hibachi.    Again, this place is okay.

We came in late on a Sunday night to a pretty dead place with only two other groups in the restaurant. This time round we decided to try Hibachi and were promptly seated by a friendly waiter who paid great attention to us all through the dinner service (different from my previous visit).  Our Hibachi chef had a bizarre sense of humor as his idea of showing us a good time entailed throwing pieces of food and sake at us. I did not particularly appreciate this as everyone at our table was well dressed for our night out and the oil stains on the clothes wasn't something we were looking for.   The food this time round was decent..nothing to rave about. We got the hibachi dinner which started off with the soup and salad followed by an entree of your choice. The entree came with fried rice and noodles both equally oily though the fried rice was tastier. I got the chicken and shrimp entree which was good. My husband got the steak which wasn't the best and my mom the salmon which she liked.  Overall though I had a better dining experience, the food did not hit the mark with my taste buds. This leaves me to contemplate if I should give this place a third attempt or cut my losses and look for a new culinary experience.",

My friend recommended we eat here for dinner after shopping in Settler's Ridge.   The inside of the restaurant is pretty. Nice decorations and sparkling floors. Our server was nice and gave us some ice cold water to start with. I needed some time to look over the menu (just a couple minutes), however, she disappeared for about 15 minutes before my friend and I actually placed our orders.   I ended up ordering some sushi (spicy shrimp avocado roll) and hibachi chicken. I really like how for only 6 bucks, you get 6 pieces of sushi. At some restaurants I've been to in the past, 6 dollars worth of sushi means only 2 pieces! Also, hibachi gets you a lot of food for a pretty good price. The hibachi chicken came with salad, soup, noodles, fried rice, vegetables, shrimp, and the chicken. They also offer yum yum sauce to pour on your meal (the sauce is addicting and delicious).   The food did take a little long to come out but was worth it. The chicken was very flavorful and not too salty. The texture of the noodles was perfect, and the veggies/salad were very fresh. The sushi was good too.   I would highly recommend Saga for lunch or dinner- the food is great! Now I want to eat hibachi more often thanks to them!",

In the end, all of these hibachi places are the same menu and experience, so I base this solely on the fact that Saga includes noodles with their hibachi selections, and I find their sushi to just be a better taste and quality than Ichiban offers.  At Saga you will get the complimentary squirts of sake into your mouth, they will springboard vegetables into the air for you to try to catch in your mouth and of course, the onion volcano. Some chefs are more energetic than others, but I think that can be found at any hibachi place.  I've been to Saga many times and it's always a good meal and a decent hibachi experience. I actually really love to go just for Sushi and sit at the Sushi Bar. The Sushi chefs usually will make a little something extra for you to try and it is always good.  If you are in the Robinson area and in the mood for hibachi or some Sushi, go to Saga.",

Saga in Robinson often fills that void, as it's an easy stop on the way home from work for me and my coworkers.  My experience is limited to the sushi, so I can't speak to the hibachi offerings... though they do always smell ah-mazing.   Saga's sushi menu is extensive, offering some combinations you don't see anywhere else, and you can't beat the happy hour prices or  1/2 price deals on Mondays (bar only).  I highly recommend the Sex Salmon appetizer on any given day.  While it may sound odd, I promise its delicious: crab stick (kani) wrapped with sashimi salmon and drizzled with ponzu sauce.  You receive 4 pieces per order, and for $5 during the bar happy hour, it's a steal!  I always order this as an appetizer, but I like it so much that sometimes I order a second portion with my sushi!   Some of my favorites are the Sweetheart Roll, Magic Roll, and Fantastic Roll, but I'm also always just as happy with a spicy California roll or yellowtail scallion roll in front of me.  I will say that sometimes the bar seems understaffed, but I'm usually here during off-hours and before the dinner rush which could explain it.",

After another 10 minutes the chef finally came out. He was very friendly but his food was horrible. He pulled out the chicken steak and scallops and the steak looked like it was weeks old. It had a grey film on the bottom before it was even in the skillet. It took 25 minutes to cook the food when it normally should not take that long. One of the steaks was extremely thin and it was only cooked for no joke 10 seconds. We asked for medium and it was rare. The chicken was cooked for way to long and had the texture of rubber. This was absolutely disgusting. When we asked for a discount on the food we didn't eat they were extremely rude and would not give us a discount. I will never be going back here again this was absolutely ridiculous. I will be going to ichiban every time after this",

Had some time to kill before a movie on a Friday night, the service was actually very fast so we didn't end up killing too much time at all! We were seated right away (opted to skip a hibachi table), our waitress was very friendly. We started with some drinks, they had a bunch of holiday specials so we went with the whiskey sour punch fishbowl which was kind of funny (though very good). The menu otherwise seemed to be your standard hibachi menu. I went with the hibachi chicken which included miso soup and a salad. The entree itself was great, a good size and great flavors. I really liked the shrimp too. It was a lot of food for $17.",

I decided to order the chicken and shrimp on the hibachi, they give you both noodles and fried rice along with a mix of vegetables.  I noticed Saga gives you large portions and I had a lot of food to take home.  I was very pleased with environment of the restaurant, the service, and food.  The price was standard with the prices of other hibachi grills, and I will probably be back for lunch sometime.",

    "text": "The food here is starting to go downhill and the service is basically non-existent. We sat at the hibachi table. The waitress took 20 minutes to just bring out waters and sodas to our table. The chef was dull and tried to make up his lack of people skills and culinary ability with an over-abundance of sake. Despite popular opinion, I am very fond of the ginger sauce that comes with the meal. When I politely asked if I could have one of each, ginger and yum yum, (instead of double yum yum like everyone else at the table) the chef treated it like gold and questioned if it would go to waste.   When it came to refills on our drinks, the waitress was nowhere in sight until everybody finished their meal and she brought the checks. She only returned with refills when she came to collect payment.   I normally add a 20% tip wherever I dine. To my surprise, the two of us had 18% gratuity added to our check already which I disputed with the waitress. On the menu in very fine print it shows a party of 4 or more gets automatic gratuity added to the check. We only had two. Her explanation is because we sat at a hibachi table with two other families that we didn't know, our table was over the limit and subject to the service charge. Be weary: Upon further inspection, the website still shows parties of 6 or more have to pay the added gratuity.   We paid and left. When we got out to the car, the waitress ran outside and knocked on our window and asked why we didn't leave another tip beyond the added gratuity.  I recommend going to Ichiban instead, even though in my opinion, their food isn't as good. At least the service is better.",

There was a generous amount of fish with each.  The thing that impressed us the most was the sushi rice... throughout all of the dishes it worked beautifully.

    "text": "It's another mediocre Asian cuisine place in Pittsburgh that is still packed, despite being mediocre. First off, I must give credit to the eye catching decor and festive ambiance. It's quite loud in there and you will leave smelling like hibachi from head to toe. Service was pleasant enough, but I feel so bad seeing how overwhelmed the employees seemed. A groupon gift brought me here, and after seeing all the unhappy reviews about the advertised vs. actual promotional value of the groupon, I did some research to make sure. Upon arrival, there was a sign at the counter clarifying about groupon use, which I assumed was placed after the restaurant received so many complaints.   I started off with a plate of ika fried squid, which comes with a side of pungest sauce. Personally, I did not like the pungest sauce with the squid, I think it would've been better with a spicy and creamy sauce. The squid was overly fried to the point where it tasted rubbery. The panko breading added a nice crisp, but the toughness and dryness of the squid itself was such a turn off. For entree, I had the chance to try the ton katsu and beef udon. The ton katsu came out in a huge portion, but again too overly fried and dry. The beef udon was flavorless and the noodle was NOT udon, it was more like glass noodle.   Overall, I was not a fan of the food here nor the long wait, despite calling in advance to make a reservation. Definitely one of those hit or miss venue that I would slap the \"try at your own risk\" label on.",

    "text": "I've been to several Saga's. This one is closer to where I live, and I've been to the one in South Hills whenever I decide to meet family, friends, shop, etc. The Saga at the South Hills Mall is FANTASTIC! This location is Average.   The restaurant is always dirty, and the sushi the last couple of times has only been average. The raw fish tastes warm, not fresh which alarms me.  The hostess's aren't enthusiastic. I've seen inappropriate gestures of the people working at the bar. The waiter we had last time was really nice and friendly though.   I should have realized that we should go somewhere else or to a different location the past couple of times when its dead on a Friday or Saturday night. I do not recommend this location, definitely try the others!",

However their staff was clueless about the sushi, making it hard to order what we wanted. Some more training for their staff and i would give them 5 stars. They need to learn the difference between the basics such as sushi and sashimi.....etc....",

    "text": "I love hibachi, but I'll never go back to Saga. The service was absolutely horrible, the hostess and waitress were both extremely rude. It took twenty minutes for the orders at our table to be taken, and then the waitress started to hand out to-go containers while everyone was still eating. Food was also thrown at me. My younger brother, who is underage, was offered saki. He refused several times before eventually accepting, because the employees were so insistent. The tables, chairs, and floor were all greasy, probably due to their habit of throwing food at customers. On the upside, the food was pretty good. I wouldn't go back though.",

    "text": "Finally a hibachi restaurant where I don't constantly sit in a state of red alert, fearing being impailed by an escaped steak knife. These hibachi artists are highly skilled. You would think that all Asians would be naturally gifted with the ability to twirl knives but unfortunately, it's not always True. I literally think these guys could cook my meal with Nunchucks. The service is the combination of a resort day spa and a Chinese message parlor. Hand and foot, head to toe. Just the way I like it. And the sushi, oh the sushi. Sushi here is like witnessing a miracle. The first bite feels as if I just watched a kitten run into a burning building and carry an infant out on its back white carrying an American flag in the mouth. Pretty sure I just came thinking about it. The sushi that is. I could go their everyday if my wife said we could afford it. And if I had a wife. Love saga, even if I can't  understand the accent.",

    "text": "The sushi was pretty amazing, and the avocado salad was great too! The reason I gave Saga a lower rating was because of the cleanliness of the place. It was a very nice looking restaurant, but wasn't as clean as I thought it should be. We sat at the sushi bar, the counter and the place mats were dirty and sticky. The floor was filthy, in much need of a good polishing. The bathroom especially was the worst, soap residue was on the wall, the garbage can was filthy, along with everything around it, also the paper towels were out too. That was pretty disappointing, being that the look of the place was nice. Someone needs to make those hostess check the bathrooms and clean them a little more often.",
