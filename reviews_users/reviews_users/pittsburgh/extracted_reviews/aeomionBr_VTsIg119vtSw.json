Unfortunately there are downsides. Portions are rather small for the price. I had falafel which pretty much lacked any flavor, tasted more like sand + cardboard. My partner had a gyro with very thin strips of meat, which he said also lacked flavor. In summary, nothing close to yummy, bursting with flavors, wonderful traditional Greek food.",

This place closes sorta early-ish so I'd think of it more of a lunch or carry out place than a True dine-in establishment.  Though I certainly did enjoy my cafe experience.  Enough options to satisfy the Greek connoisseur, but simple enough to appeal to the dumbos like myself.  The falafel sandwich was absolutely fantastic.  The hummus had a nice zing to it, which was appreciated.  Portion sizes were plenty.  Some of the entrees cost a bit more than what you'd expect to pay (paying in the teens for some dishes), but as long as you stick to the simple sandwiches, you'll certainly receive a fair value.",

I awoke from my midday nap with obvious hunger in my belly, and I was craving something from the land---you know, made with vegetables and animals grazing on hillsides, like the pictures I've seen in books.  Anyway, I headed down to Pastitsio for a gyro ($8, with a \"salad\"). The gyro perfection was indeed perfect, but the side salad was weak and sloppy wet with a flavorless oil sauce, like my Uncle Red's toupee they found after Katrina hit town. The gyro was definitely flavorful, and not obscenely enormous like some places make them (Rodos Greek Cafe). But the salad was so bad, I knew I need to get home and Yelp to all my homies in the L-Ville.  Service was fine and average, no complaints. And the atmosphere is hip metal tables, exposed brick, and yuppie hipster prices. There was a lovey-dovey couple next to me romantically sharing some rice pudding(also overpriced).  My main gripe is that I don't feel I got $8 of gyro and salad--it shoulda been $5. And the menu had too many options.  I'm a simple man, as you can tell by my picture. Cheap Greek food should be CHEAP. Now, back to whoopin some ass...",

Tried the lemonade, which was cheap *and* actually made with lemons, delicious.  Took home a pound of dolmades - vegetarian grape leaves.  The dolmades were a touch dry, but didn't last the day anyways.  I'm interested in heading back in a month or so, seeing how the place progresses as they're open longer.",

    "text": "Great Greek food deli that adds to the character of Lo-La (Lower Lawrenceville)!  I have been to Pastitsio ever since it newly opened and have enjoyed coming here ever since.  It's a tiny little deli with spare indoor seating and outdoor seating on an adjacent patio.  The place is bright and decor is streamlined and clean.    The lamb souvlakia dish is an excellent standout and my personal favorite whenever I stop by for lunch.  The lamb is locally sourced and tender, the rice pilaf is flavorful and deliciously textured with mixed grains.  The tzatziki sauce is light, refreshing and creamy and perfectly complements the meat.  The side salad is served with a fantastic homemade Greek dressing made with high quality olive oil.  The pastitsio and moussaka are delicious and I love the spanakopita and baklava.    Chef Matt is super friendly and really cares about his food and ingredients. While I was in there talking to him one day, he brought it up that he caters as well (duh, it's on his website but I didn't think to look there) and I decided to have him cater my son's birthday party.  I couldn't have picked a friendlier and more helpful catering service to do this.  Matt went the extra mile to help me pick out dishes and set up the food for the party and offered all this at a reasonable price.  Our guests raved about the food.  The hummus, salad and pita appetizers were delicious and all our guests wanted to take pastitsio, soutsoukakia and baklava home with them!  I'm not sure why this place has gotten negative reviews.  It is, after all, a deli trying to serve home-cooked good food at restaurant quality levels so being critical of the service when there are only one or two people working the place is slightly unfair.   I'll definitely be a regular here.",

T'was criminal, really, that I hadn't been to Pastitsio before since I only live up the hill from it. I seem to always stop by when they're closed! (That being said, they do have slightly strange hours.) I stopped reading the menu as soon as I got to FALAFEL SANDWICH and, pupils dilated, saliva dripping, just repeatedly pointed at the words until I received my sandwich. While the ten minute wait for my sandwich might very well have been the longest ten minutes of my life, every bite was sooooo sooo worth it. Everything was just amazingly fresh! From the cucumber and carrot salad to the veggies in the sandwich, it seriously tasted like they just uprooted their produce in the back upon receiving my order. The best part, however, was the falafel itself. It was certainly unconventional in that it tasted much richer and more moist than falafel I've had elsewhere. If only I could replicate everything in my own kitchen! Alas, I'm forced to return again and again on an empty stomach (though leaving fully satiated).  I really thought I had had the best falafel in town at Kassab's, but Pastitsio seriously gives them a run for their money! Now, I just need to get them to deliver lunch to my workplace... (and cater my birthday... and maybe my wedding... and my bat mitzvah...)",

The food was simple and the flavors were right on. Meats come from local farms and ingredients are fresh.

The service is really good too. Crystal and the owner, Matt, are very attentive and friendly.   I highly recommend the specials whenever they are on the board. Their falafel sandwich is great, and make sure you try all the salads, from the house to the beet to the wheat salad.   The one tiny downside to this place is the inside decor. I don't like the aluminum-ish tables and would prefer nice wooden ones, but I understand that the place was made for take-out. They have some nice pictures up and a beautiful wooden bench on the side, which I sit on whenever I am taking food home with me. While the inside might do with a little added warmth, the out-door patio is pretty sweet to lounge and enjoy all the great food.",

We had the falafel sandwich ($6), grilled veggie sandwich ($6), zucchini soup ($3.50) and some dolmas ($2). The dolmas we just grabbed out of the fridge and were not too exciting, but if you find most dolmas too slimy you'll like that these are dry. Also quite small and high ratio of leave to contents. Then the soup came out and was delicious. Simple balanced flavors.  But the sandwiches are why I'm taking the time to write a review. The pita was thick and spongy. The falafel was the lightest and fluffiest I've ever had. They mash it in the sandwich so it's shaped more like a panini than the Noah's ark style that I usually see. I don't go for simple grilled veggies often, but that sandwich was also great. Not too oily, not too stiff. Finally, the side salad included was so good it would stand on its own. The vegetables were fresh, the olives were as large as the tomatoes and nearly as juicy.  Highly recommended.",

A party of two that came in 30 minutes after our party of two received their food before we did and our food took forever to come out.   Water was hardly ever refilled and they were out of 3-4 items on the menu.  Why are they on the menu if you are out of them?   There were at least 3 people working for only 4 tables. I don't understand how the service was so bad. Also, a couple came in and had a reservation and the waitress who had no clue what was happening told them they could wait for the next table.  They ended up leaving after waiting for 30 minutes past their reservation.   Greek Stop in Glenshaw is far better service and food and is worth the 20 minute drive.   I will not go back to Pastitsio",

The salad that came with it already was also very good (included lettuce, carrots and olives) but I was glad to also have the True horiatiki). Really nice souvlaki which included juicy char grilled chicken breast, onion, green pepper, repeat on a simple bed of lemon rice. Also perfect tzatziki! This place is also super cute and pristinely clean with real little flower vases on each table. Will be back for sure and this time to dine in.",

    "text": "So...  I went when Pastitsio first opened and was a little disappointed. There weren't many options, the portions were small and pricey and my bf and I were just \"meh\" about it. I haven't been back since that visit until today....  All I have to say is that I am disappointed in MYSELF that I didn't return to this place sooner! It is super close to my house, and I had no idea I could have access to fresh, DELISH hummus all the time. Hummus is a food group for me, and being a vegetarian, it is one of the only things I can order at a lot of restaurants/bars besides salad. So I love it, I never get sick of it. Pastitsio's does it FRESH and RIGHT! It is so good paired with their warm pita! You can also buy containers to go, and now that I know this, I will probably be back frequently!  They also have an array of fresh (vegan/veggie) salads like Tabboulah and potato salad with olive oil, not mayo. They have daily specials (bf got the carved chicken sandwich) and many other fun things in their to-go fridge. BF loved the salad dressing as well!  Plus, they were so friendly when we walked in! Super nice people, they brought everything to our table on nice plates, and just made the extra effort. Can't wait to be back for my weekly hummus fill!",

The gyro received praise.  I thought my chicken was decent, and the salad & dressing were fresh... however the rice tasted off to me, like it'd been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit of a disappointment since our server had recommended it mixed with tsaziki sauce.  Speaking of whom, our server was very sweet, attentive, and didn't rush us after we'd finished eating (even when the place got full).  I will probably give Pastitsio another chance; it's close to work, and I'd also like to check out the homemade hummus & pita that another reviewer mentioned.",

At first I thought it was nice that the kitchen was open and you could see your food being prepared. Then the smoke came and clouded the whole restaurant.   Then the food came...or should I say the kids meal came. The portion was barely enough to feed a 12 year old. However - the food here was good! I just wish I had more. The falafel was soft and the salad was pretty good but I wanted more than a few bites. I guess it's a good strategy - make them want more!",

I emailed the restaurant to make a reservation at 7.  When my group showed up they had no idea what I was talking about, even though I had received a return email confirming my reservation.  The place was empty inside so we still got a table without a problem.  It took over 20 minutes for them to get us water for the table and over 30 minutes for us to order.  The food we ordered was extremely simple - 2 salads and 2 gyros.  How that order took well over an hour to serve us still blows my mind. When we did get an appetizer they forgot to serve the break with it.  They never once came to get us refills, to the point where we had to walk in the kitchen and ask; even then it took another 10 minutes to get a glass of water.  When the food finally came we were even more disappointed.  The food was exceedingly average at best.  The worst part was one of us ordered the gyro plain with no sauce.  Not surprisingly they put sauce on it but had to audacity to scrape it off and still serve it to us.  Unbelievable, it came out with remnants of sauce and who knows what on the pita bread.  We immediately sent it back and received attitude from the server when we did.  After having to ask for a box and the bill and waiting another 20 minutes we were finally out of that awful experience.  The service was terrible and the food was extremely average at best.  We will not be going back.",

I also recommend their baklava, which I consider some of the best in Pittsburgh, but the reason I like it is that it's not as sweet as others make it -- so your mileage may vary. Their moussaka is also good, but we rarely choose that over the pastitsio.  The staff is really nice and laid-back. The portions are not giant Pittsburgh portions, but they're appropriate and I think the price is totally right for the quality and freshness of the food.",

    "text": "Another great Lawrenceville spot.  This is a very nice, small greek cafe with a cute little enclosed patio. The owner has been rocking this spot for nearly 10 years. Hard to miss if you're in the neighborhood and want to have some really good Mediterranean food al fresco.   My partner and I were lucky enough to have been part of a small, intimate Yelp event here, where nearly everything on the menu was showcased for us. The owner explained almost every dish, talked to all of us and served us up some really great food.  First, we had a sampler plate of the appetizers: spanakopita, falafel, dolmathes (my fav), eggplant puree, and hummus. Everything was really great, I even tried the eggplant puree (not babaganoush) and I don't even like eggplant. Next we had this twist on a salad - it was tomatoes, red onion, feta and kalamata olives on a hard barley bread called a \"rusk\". This reminded me a lot of taboule, but the grain being a hard bread that softened in the tomato and olive juices. Crunchy bites, mixed with feta and tomato - it was really nice. We had shrimp and feta over linguine for an entree. Luckily, I can never get enough feta cheese. Nice plump shrimp mixed with feta with a light tomato sauce - more cheese than sauce, so think lighter than traditional Italian style sauces. This would be great to eat on the patio in the summer.  If you go to Pastitsio and you order nothing else - order the greek yogurt. They make this stuff in house, strain it and remove the whey which makes a very creamy and stiff yogurt. This was amazing, almost like a soft serve ice cream with a very slight vanilla flavor, covered with pretzel pieces and strawberries. The owner said it really holds up in the summer months, cool and refreshing. Gimme a glass of water and a serving of this on a hot summer day, man! Too cool for school. It was the perfect desert to top off our little culinary tour of what this place has to offer.  Go there - tell em your cousin Benny sent ya.",

I have yet to try the rice pudding but I plan on it.  On my first trip I had moussaka. It was like lasagna and was delicious. The side salad is nothing to write home about but the oil dressing was perfect and had that light, handmade touch that makes real dressing so much better than the bottled stuff.  On a second trip it was insanely busy due to their recent Groupon involvement. The service was slow but I had the feeling they simply weren't use to the amount of people coming in. Either way, my lamb gyro was delicious and the pita, as others have said, is perfect. Served warm and fluffy with a bit of crispiness on the outside.  Definitely give this place a try. It's an interesting place to dine because Stamatis changes the menu so often and uses high quality, local ingredients.

Very authentic greek food (and I've eaten A LOT of greek), with incredibly fresh ingredients. You can tell the chef puts love in his culinary endeavors. The BYOB is helpful as well! (no corking fee). Our waitress did a good job. No complaints about service, and the greek music is a lovely ambience. The soup was delicious and very flavorful, and the lamb pitas were some of the best I've ever had. Don't skip the Baklava or Greek Yogurt, Walnuts and Honey desserts either - they're worth it.  Will be back in the near future!",

We were seated outside immediately upon arrival and our waitress was pouring us waters and opening our bottle of wine within minutes! (It is BYOB!)   We started out with the hummus appetizer and the saganaki They both had a fresh and homemade taste to them! I highly recommend trying the two together.   We were served their house salad before our entrees came and they were perfect. The dressing was very authentic! Out of our entire party the highlights of the entrees were the shrimp dish with the basmati rice and the lamb gyro.    We finished off the meal by splitting the rice pudding and baklava. Again, they were both noticeably homemade and delicious.   The reason for four stars instead of five was due to the quality given for their price point. We will be back!",

    "text": "Pastitsio is a lovely and tasty little Greek deli in the heart of Lower Lawrenceville.  The indoor space is very small and makes it look more like a take-out joint, but I love eating on the outdoor patio, which has lovely tables and big umbrellas for shade.  Matt (the owner) and Crystal are both super sweet and take extra care to make sure you have an enjoyable experience eating there.  For the most part, their food is delicious.  They make AMAZING chicken pitas and the salads are always super fresh and on point.  Their ingredients are always fresh and sourced as locally as possible.  Their food is extremely reasonably priced given the quality of the ingredients and the care and love that is obviously put into making it.  You can get a delicious chicken pita -- probably the best I've had in the city -- and a fresh side salad for just $7.  For some dishes, the portions aren't huge (and if they are, you will pay more like $10-15 per dish) but they do have good deals and coupons from time to time.  Definitely try it out if you're looking for lunch in Lawrenceville!  I get takeout from here all the time.",

First off the menu is VERY small & they only have a couple vegetarian choices. The portions of food are very small & it's a little pricey for the amount of food they give you. My husband & I eached ordered a falafel sandwich & split an appetizer & we both left still hungry.  The falafel sandwich came with a very tiny side sale that was actually really good, the salad dressing was the best part of the whole meal. I was not a fan of the falafels. They did not have a crispy outer shell like every falafel I've eaten. They were really mushy.  Also, it was kind of weird that the appetizer that we ordered came out after our entree. We got the entree first & the appetizer came out about half way through our meal.  On the up side service was good. Our waitress was very nice.  However I most likely will not be back. The quality is not bad it just wasn't my thing.",

    "text": "I cannot believe I've waited this long to come here!  I passed it on Butler for months and months and never went in, but always thinking I had to go.  Now to think of how many delicious meals I have missed out on makes me sad!  I tried to order the lamb sandwich but they were out, so it could have ended badly.  But don't you worry, they still had veggies, so I opted for the roasted veggie sandwich.  It. Was. Incredible!  I loved the soft doughy pita, the delicious perfectly roasted roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant with a creamy saziki sauce. Of course, I also couldn't resist a beet salad side.  When you order a beet salad you never really know if you'll get (I mean, unless you read the menu...I just see beets and get excited!), greens and beets or just beets.  This time it was just beets, but it was still great with a slight taste of orange and vinegar.     The place is super tiny, but wasn't too crowded.  The one negative thing was it was hot as hades inside.  I believe it was probably around 40 outside, so when I walked outside it was refreshing.  I even started fanning myself with a City Paper at one point!    Other than that, killer meal and I will most definitely be putting this on my lunch rotation in Lola!",

Shortly thereafter, two more gentlemen arrived and our server asked for our menus because he said he didn't have enough.  That was a little strange.  He took our drink and appetizer order and didn't come back for 15 to 20 minutes.  We had to ask for my husband's drink three times. It began pouring and we had to bring our drinks and appetizers inside.  Our spanikopita sat within viewing range for 10 minutes before the waiter delivered it separately, after being cued by my father-in-law.  An half of an hour later, we finally had the opportunity to place our order.  During the next 30 minutes, we sat with dirty plates on our tables, hoping he would come back so we could order drink refills.  At one hour in, my husband finally got the server and asked him how much longer we would have to wait.  He said five minutes.  We were about to walk out when the food finally arrived. The food was ok, just ok and over priced. My son's chicken, which was a small portion over rice, cost $18.  My soup was amazingly flavorful, the one caveat to a terrible dining experience.   No apology from the waiter.  No explanation.  No offer to pay for drinks or comp anything.  I felt very bad for the second table of gentlemen.  They had to wait even longer than us, and at about 45 minutes in, the server informed them that they had run out of lamb.  We are never going back.  There are too many amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh to give them a second chance.",

To start we had the hummus app. It was not on their menu but we asked the server about a possible hummus app and she of course made it happen with no problem!   The hummus was delicious, a very nice serving and was accompanied with fresh warm pita, zucchini, carrot and pepper sticks.   For the main course, I had the vegetable pita with no tzatziki, which the server assured me would be vegan friendly. It was soooo tasty! I'm not sure the spices that were on the pita, but it was honestly delicious! Yum!   My lunch pal had the original gyro, she also said it was very delicious.   I would be happy to come back and eat again! We left full and happy, not to mention the prices are very reasonable!",

The space is cute and they have an outdoor patio if you'd rather eat outside.  The food is extremely fresh.  Depending where you sit, you may even be able to see them make each dish from scratch.  At one point, we saw them cutting up a watermelon and commented about the freshness of all ingredients.  The watermelon ended up on our plate as a post-meal cleanse.  The hummus is out of this world - so fresh.  The falafel is amazing as well, perfectly cooked - never too dry.  The gyro meat is homemade and so much better than anything you will get elsewhere (way less greasy).  The salads are fresh and the dressing complements them well.  I have ordered lamb, chicken, and shrimp entrees, and have been blown away each time.  I could not recommend Pastitsio enough.  It is BYOB, so if you are hoping to enjoy some wine with your meal, bring it with you.  They will provide wine glasses and will uncork your bottle free of charge.  They do serve soft drinks and water.  I also want to add that there are ample options for diners with celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity.  The server was knowledgeable of which dishes were suitable for her dietary needs and was flexible in what they would offer (i.e. lettuce wraps on gyros, etc.).",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays with my wife for lunch.  We happened to be in Lawrenceville for the afternoon due to the Joy of Cookies and so we knew that we would be having lunch in the area.  Both my wife and i remembered passing Pastitsio before although in its previous location and thought it would be place to eat.  So we headed on over and sat down.  The inside of this place is quite small with seating for 20 people although to be honest if there was 20 people inside, it would be tough to move.  It has an exposed brick wall on one side of the dining room, an odd mountain mural on another and is painted a baby blue on the third.  The chairs were stainless steel while the floors were tiled.  For lunch on this day my wife and I decided to start off with the hummus while i went with the falafel gyro for my entree and she went with the chicken gyro.  The menu describes the hummus as a puree of chickpeas, sesame and lemon served with vegetables and pita bread (big enough for 2) while the falafel pita was described as fried chickpeas put in a pita with tomatoes, lettuce, pickled onions and tzatziki sauce.  Our hummus came out first and the menu wasn't lying by saying that it was big enough for two .  The hummus itself was decent but what I really enjoyed about the dish was the carrots, bell peppers, celery and cucumber which came with it.  After we had finished with that some salads came out next.  Neither my wife nor I had known we would be getting one but we were both happy about it.  There was a nice mix of lettuce, cucumber and carrot that was dressed lightly and tasted quite fresh.  Interestingly this may be the first salad that I have ever had which had dill in it and I liked it.  After finishing the salads and with my wife and I already starting to feel a little full, our entrees arrived to the table.  Both gyros looked good and we quickly dove into them.  My gyro consisted of 4 falafels, all of which had a good flavor to them.  The tzatziki sauce here provided a nice base for the gyro as it was flavorful without being overpowering.  Meanwhile the pickled onions provided a nice little pop of acidity to the dish which really helped to bring it all together.  Overall i thought it was a good gyro and I know that my wife liked hers as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  All of the food that we had here was good and both my wife and I left feeling quite full.",

    "text": "My mom and I went to the Pgh Vintage Mixer this afternoon, we were having a girls date out!   We were trying to decide where to eat an early dinner in Lawrenceville. I've been eyeing up Pastitsio for a few weeks. They follow me on Instagram via my twistburgh account, so I definitely wanted to check them out!   The restaurant is small, but very cozy. Our waitress was so friendly. The restaurant has a great atmosphere.   To start, we order the Saganaki (Pan fried kafalograviera cheese and finished with a savory brandy. Vegetarian and gluten free) it was delicious! Heads up, if you check in on Yelp  - you get a free order of Spanakopita (2 squares of crispy sheets of phyllo layered with spinach, herbs and feta. Vegetarian.) The spanakopita is to die for! They also gave use grilled pita that tasted amazing  .  For our entrees, I ordered the Chicken Souvlakia (Marinated chicken with garlic, olive oil and lemon, severed over basmati rice. Come with sides salad. Gluten free.) You can either order the lunch or dinner portion in the afternoon. My mom ordered the Lamb Souvlakia (Marinated leg of lamb with garlic, olive oil and lemon and severed over basmati rice. Come with sides salad. Gluten free) - these entrees were amazing. It was the perfect amount of food for an early afternoon dinner. The lamb and chicken were cooked perfectly. The rice was delicious as well. The side salads were wonderful. It was literally the freshest salad I've ever had.   For dessert, we ordered baklava to go. I can't wait to try them later.   This place is BYOB, so I'll definitely be back with a great bottle of wine!",

The moussaka was perfectly prepared and the hummus was addictive. Even the rice pilaf was mouth watering. The meal went from fantastic to epic when the dessert came out. Their galaktoboureko was heaven. Never had it served with a lemon wedge before and shame on me. The lemon added a whole different dimension and boy was it worth it. I can't say enough great things about Pastitsio....make sure you come with your favorite bottle and your favorite group of friends!",

    "text": "I really went in with high hopes and an open heart.  I feel sincerely let down.  I love Greek food, but I did not love my experience here.  The good: The bench along the wall is really comfy seating.    Despite being small, the big window makes it feel much more open.  The spanikopita was good.  It was just this side of burnt, but it was delicious.  The not so good: Dead plants. Everywhere.  The flowers on the tables were all dead/wilted.  The plants in front of the windows were dead/dying.    There were really pretty tablecloths, but they were covered with sheets of paper.  I've seen this before, but usually just the top of the table so you can still see the tablecloths.  It felt redundant to have real cloths you can't see topped by paper ones (some of which were dirty but set for the next guests to sit at anyway.) Maybe just remove both cloths and have a bare table?    BYOB is cool, but maybe think about having something simple like iced tea available, or maybe mint for the water? Something that still feels home made but is more than just iced water.  I felt really unwelcome when I said I was eating in.  The employee (server/host?) did not seem happy to have company. This played right into me ordering and changing my mind as I handed the server my menu and how she rolled her eyes. She did not seem at all happy.  I felt anxious and awkward the whole time I was there.  The Avgolemono soup.  I was excited when I checked online to see it on the menu.  It was the last meal I got for my mother before she passed and I couldn't wait to enjoy it. It was dreadful.  Absolutely awful.  It was the worst soup I've ever had.  At first  I thought it was just bland, and I added some pepper and squeezed a lemon wedge into it, and it was edible.  It was edible if you ignored that it tasted like plastic, and that it was either made with orzo that had gone soft by sitting too long, or with rice that had gone soft and puffy by sitting too long.  It was just warm enough to eat and that means that it was re-heated.  My guess is that it wasn't the first time this batch had been reheated, and my stomach proved me right.  I don't get a sour stomach often, but this was the worst case of it I've ever had. I was too intimidated by the server to send it back and I paid for it.  Even my iron stomach couldn't handle however long that soup and been sitting, probably in the fridge and then reheated for dinner and back in the fridge again.  It left a taste on my tongue for hours that neither water nor strong tea could get rid of and on the ride home all I could think of was brushing my teeth.   Can we talk about music choice for a minute? It felt like the worst of the 50s and 60s grating, loudly, over the speakers.  I truly wish I'd checked out the tacos next door.",

    "text": "I decided to start with lunch for the first part of my cookie tour. This Greek restaurant opens at 11 so I ran in there to get out the cold. Yes, Yelpers you get one free spakopita with your check in. That is a square of phyllo layered with spinach, herbs and feta cheese. It is on their appetizer menu where you would get two for $6.00 if you wish.  I noticed on the menu that both their chicken pita and their lamb pita are both home bred meats from various farms. Throughout the past year I've been enjoying homegrown food wherever I visit so I opted for the lamb pita. This place is very small and takeout is available. Seating was not a problem for me since I got there when it opened.   It did take a while to get the food but as the saying goes \"good things come to those who wait.\" I got my spakopita first and literally it was so good I was craving another. However, knowing I would be \"cookie logged\" today I resisted the temptation to buy the appetizer.  My gyro came with a side salad and a sauce which my waitress told me was very hot and spicy. I really appreciate her telling me this because I can't handle things like that. Both the lamb gyro and salad were delicious! The salad really doesn't need any topping. It is good as it comes. As I was eating she brought me out my \"cookie\" which was homemade from scratch baklava. This small piece was so good I just had to buy a couple of pieces to take home with me for later.  They also offer vegetable, vegan, and gluten free items on the menu. It is Greek so you will find the traditional Greek fare along with some different things  This is one place on my I will return bucket list. As I noted it does take some time for your meal to be prepared but if it is delicious it is well worth the wait. Located near Arsenal Middle school towards lower Lawrenceville this place makes a healthy addition to the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I am pretty torn while writing this review. This review is solely based on a to-go order I placed over the weekend. I cannot speak to a sit down dining experience at this point. First things first, if you have a large party this is not the place for you. I noticed two 4 top tables and three 2 top tables inside. They do have a patio which is great during the warm summer months, but not so much of an option during winter. I was the only person in the restaurant at the time I placed my order and it took probably 15 minutes for it to be ready. I only saw the owner and one other person in the kitchen. This is the True definition of a mom and pop shop that offers fresh and local ingredients in each of their dishes.   I ordered a gyro to-go and that is usually my go to at Greek restaurants. I was surprised to find out that a side salad comes with the pitas. The salad was fresh and I probably could have crushed a whole bowl of it. I had pretty high expectations for the gyro after eating that delicious salad. First, I noted that the gyro meat was nice and thick without overwhelming the pita. After my first bite I immediately thought something was slightly over seasoned with dill. I'm not sure if it was the gyro meat or the tzatziki sauce, but something in the pita was seasoned a little too much. Unfortunately, Pastitsio will not be my first choice when I'm craving a gyro.",

He ordered some chicken dinner, and I got the Greek salad with gyro. The Greek dressing was very flavorful, and the salad had loads of colorful veggies. My salad was delicious and I was completely full after I ate it. We also ordered a side of hummus and pita that was yummy, but i wish it came with some veggie sticks along with the pita.

It was hot, creamy from the eggs, tart from the lemon, and delicious. We had chicken and lamb souvlakia for our entrees. The proteins were moist and well seasoned, the salad and its dressing was beautiful, and the rice was ok. The rice was a bit too crisped up for my taste, like it had been left on the stove or in the oven for too long.

Yogurt, hummus, baba ghanouj, pita bread, kebab are some of the first foods that I tasted which weren't soul food influenced besides pizza or Chinese food.  The sharp, often acidic flavors mixed with piquant spices really appeal to me and the food served at Pastistio knocked me out.  Don't go looking for just gyros (which they have) because there is so much more to their menu.  My daughter and I have been to Pastistio previously for their Palakari, which is a mixture of Red Winter Wheat, Black-eyed peas, shallots and Red wine Vinegar, orzo salad and gyro platters.  Delicious!  On our visit for the prix fixe dinner, we had a mezze platter with falafel, pita bread, tzatziki, hummus, roasted eggplant puree, dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves), spanakopita and olives.  Whew!  I feel full and just got tired from listing all of that stuff.  We were also served the Dakos Salata, which is a Greek take on the Italian panzanella bread salad.  Pastistio's is served over a piece of barley rusk which provides a nice nutty counterbalance to the tomatoes, feta cheese and other acidic ingredients.  For our entree we were served the Shrimp and Feta (Shrimp seasoned and sauteed with a white wine & fresh tomato sauce with angel hair pasta) and for dessert we were served a homemade whole cream yogurt with strawberry & lime spoon sweets.  The owner, Stamatis (Matt) Bournias and his staff provided excellent service and wonderful food!  ! (Fantastic!)   ! (We will be back!)",

The kind of homemade where you never want to eat another spanakopita again because another can never compare.   The patio on the side is also a nice spot to enjoy the outdoors away from sidewalk traffic, with good people watching.",

I truly would recommend anything on the menu, always get FETA. Sit outside in the warm weather and enjoy!",

    "text": "The gyro here is pretty tasty.  The ingredients are fresh (and local) and the flavors are good.  Each component is very tasty on its own: the warm soft pita, nicely seasoned lamb, yummy tzatziki, and fresh veggies.  It was all very good, but didn't knock my socks off when assembled together--still tasty though.  I plan to come back and get another gyro or try out the falafel.  $10 minimum on credit/debit card purchases kind of stinks, but I understand why businesses do it.",

    "text": "I was passing by on my way to Coca, but decided to stop in here instead as it was empty.  I was taking out for lunch.  The ambiance was typical of a deli.  A counter, two refrigerated cases, one with the drinks, the other with sides, and a couple of tables.    I ordered the falafel sandwich, a side of hummus, and baklava.  I am very picky about falafel, and this was amazing! She made it right on the spot.  I was perfectly moist and flavorful, and it was flattened out to fit in the sandwich, which made it much easier to eat.  The pita was soft and thick.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious.  It came with a side salad which was an average side salad.  Romaine with some chopped veggies and vinaigrette, nothing to rave about.  The hummus was okay.  It was a little dry, but the flavor was good.  The baklava was delicious.  It was a nice, large piece.  The top was flaky and the bottom sweet and moist.  The nuts were not too large but not difficult to distinguish.  Overall, it was very good and I am definitely planning on returning.",

It was really cool to sit outdoors under the stars and the food that was prepared by Chef Matt was just wonderful! The appetizers, Patitsio, Chicken skewers, and Spanikopita was delicious.  The salad was fresh and the dressing that went with was very tasty. The seasame cookies and special grape dessert from Alex was amazing as well! I will definitely be recommending Patitsio to my friends!",

    "text": "Love love love this place. Awesome greek food, using fresh, local ingredients (you can taste the quality), with fantastic service (the two women at the counter were really lovely). When I first saw the prices, I balked a little thinking them pretty high for what I assumed was just a run-of-the-mill takeout gyro shop. Boy was I wrong! This is not your everyday takeout fare and the menu goes far beyond the standard takeout greek. Greek yogurt made fresh in-house with grilled pomegranate? Yes, please. I assume they mostly do a takeout business because the seating area is pretty small but it was actually quite nice and, from the looks of it, they have a BYOB policy (very cool). Definitely try this place. I recommend the house salad with lamb (this is not your ordinary house salad...there are amazing roasted vegetables and dolmas on top and the dressing is delicious and light). My boyfriend had the chicken gyro and was still talking about how yummy it was the next morning.",

The falafel sandwich was the best I have tasted since I visited Greece.  The chef/ owner came in straight from the Lawrenceville Farmer's Market while we were there for lunch.  The freshness of the produce shows in the incredible favors.  They make their own yogurt in house!  I can't wait to go back with a group and sit on the patio with some growlers of beer from East End Brewing and enjoy this delicious food again.",
