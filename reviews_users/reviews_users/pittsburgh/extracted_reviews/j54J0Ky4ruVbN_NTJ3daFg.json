    "text": "My favorite Italian place in Pittsburgh. The food here is consistently delicious and the servers are always attentive. Girasole has a seasonal menu, but it also has some staples, such as penne marinara and linguine rustic. In addition to the seasonal menu, it also has daily specials. I most recently had their special pasta, which was linguine with bison bolognese, roasted pepper ricotta, and roasted pine nuts. The linguine was a little on the softer side, but the bison was chewy and created an interesting contrast in texture. The meal also came with bread and salad (which I switched for wedding soup). The bread with olive oil and vinegar was my biggest weakness. The olive oil and vinegar comes in a little cruet and is the cutest thing. The bread was soft and soaks up the olive oil and vinegar very well. The restaurant can be very crowded, but all in all, the food is worth it.",

Time to snap back to reality.  In bay area terms, this is a solid Italian restaurant, offering familiar items such as gnocchi, polenta, and risotto. I actually quite like the way they prepared their pasta, and the dishes come in quite an American portion too (read: big).  However, the food itself tasted a little less fresh than I'd like. Maybe the harsh winter was to blame, as it was still quite chilly in May when we revisited lately. Either way, after living on the other coast and longing for good Italian food, this does satisfy a little bit with the well-prepared pasta, but it also leaves me longing for more.",

    "text": "Went with the boyfriend yesterday for valentines day dinner, which I guess I should've expected would be crazy. We walked inside past about 4 people standing inside the \"heated dormer\" and 2 people shivering outside. We got there about 5:55 and our reservation was at 6. The I assumed owner who was an older Italian man in a suit came over and told us we'd have the next table...so we stayed inside standing ON TOP of the table in the front. A few other people were standing there too. When a few people left the owner came back and sat us but he'd also said hello to another man who said he'd had a 5:45 reservation...I wasn't sure what was going on, but assumed he had it under control. We were led to a table against the wall that was situated behind two other tables. This place is small and they had no problems with CRAMING you in there! I had to turn in a few different directions to take my coat off without hitting someone. The waiter couldn't even stand next to the table because there were only about 6 inches between us and the next table. So he stood behind me and took my order. From speaking to a cousin who went a few Saturday's ago that's normal there...wow...  The wine bottles were mostly upwards of $40, so we opted for 2 glasses for 9.50 each, which was perfect anyways. I got the spinach and ricotta raviolis in a tomato cream sauce!! They were delicious!! I also swapped the salad for the wedding soup, which was awesome too!! Boyfriend got the salad and loved it! I then got the tiramisu, which is my favorite!! I must say it was good, but I wasn't really impressed for an Italian restaurant. The lady fingers were a little dry.  Overall I would go back, but it would have to be at an off time, like a week night or something. I don't like not being able to see my waiter even because he can't fit between the tables. I mean like tighter than the Cheesecake Factory tables but tables in the isle way as well...ridiculous...it also was awful there was no where to stand or any sort of order as to how people were seated.",

When we arrived, several patrons had still not been seated even though the owner had verbally told them a certain time. Some of the customers had \"reservations\" at 8 and we still not seated. I don't know if Girasole was overwhelmed that night because of Pittsburgh restaurant week but it was difficult to find the hostess/host.   On the food side, I ended up not getting any of the dishes offered during Pittsburgh restaurant week because I wanted to try their traditional Italian dishes. I got the white clam sauce which was delicious. However, my favorite part of the meal was actually their side salad. I also loved how their olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dispenser was all in one for their complimentary bread. I also chose to try their Turkish coffee gelato which was the best coffee gelato I've had in awhile. I definitely will come back when it's less busy and hopefully I can change my opinion about the service.",

First off, we had a reservation for 8, and my friend and I called to see if we could get in early. Pie (the sweet Owner who greets every guest with a hug or a handshake) said he would try and squeeze us in. Upon arrival the restaurant was PACKED but, he did everything he could to make us feel welcome, including opening our bottles of wine before we sat down.   After waiting for a bit, we were seated at a small table and immediately greeted by a friendly server. The menu seemed to be special each night so we ordered those dishes but, I would recommend looking at the pasta dishes before ordering one of the specialties. I saw these come out and boy did they look good. I will come back here and have already told my friends about how good this place is!",

Finally, a man came over (I think the owner) and gave an open table to people who didn't have a reservation.

We arrived early  at 6.25 and were standing behind a party of 6 who DID NOT have a reservation.  The owner Mr Girasole sat the party in front of us at our table set for 7.  When my niece spoke up and said,  \"that's our table\", he completely ignored her and sat them down instead.  He did not even offer an apology or try to make it right in any way.  He just said we had to wait. Well needless to say, we did not wait. We went a block away to The Yard and had a fantastic meal without having to wait for a table, and they were packed.   They say NY is a rude city.  We NEVER experienced anything like that in our lives.  We will never attempt to go back to Girasole and our niece will spread the word and will never recommend that place again! That one star is only because we don't have the choice of negative stars!!

    "text": "A friend told me about Girasole. She is Italian and said it's one of the best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. My husband surprised me and took me there for my birthday. It was a beautiful evening so we opted to sit outside. Later we were very glad because the restaurant was packed inside. It's a small restaurant but it was still a little crazy to see how packed it was on a Tuesday night. That's a sign of a great restaurant.  I started off by ordering a Bellini. It's my favorite adult beverage. I think it was 90% champagne, which was fine with me. We ordered our meals and chatted and people watched while we waited on our food. They brought our salads first. The salads had mixed greens, chick peas, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, carrots, and goat cheese. It was delicious!!! Next our entrees were served. I had ordered one of the specials-Seafood Risotto. It had lobster, shrimp, scallops, and octopus. All of the pieces of seafood were large. No skimping there!  The risotto was cooked perfectly and had an amazing flavor. It was some of the best I have ever had. The octopus was on top and it had been grilled to perfection.  My husband ordered the Linguine with Clams. The noodles were homemade and were also some of the best we ever had. There were so many clams that he had to use two bread plates to hold all of the shells. The sauce-white wine, garlic, and butter-was so good that we were dipping our bread from our bread basket into it.  For dessert we shared a piece of coconut cake. There were two layers of the lightest and fluffiest cake I have ever eaten. Between the two layers was a vanilla custard. It was iced with white icing and then covered on coconut. In my world there is no such thing as too much coconut.  I was beyond pleased with the food and the service. It is now on my list as a favorite.",

(My original review is below. Read it before ordering Here).    No I did not bring up potatoes with waitress as she recommended them. When food is as \"off\" as it was at your restaurant, I make the assumption that if this food is served and offered as high quality, we are not on the same page regarding freshness and quality, and a critique would not be understood and considered rude.  The potatoes were not \"made to order\" as you know.  A square was cut from a pan that was stored in  your frig overnight. Even if freshly made (they were not) the dish was dry and flavorless.  Made worse by reheating.  The steak was more or less cooked to order - it was med rare - but it was not high quality and was flavorless.  I didnt think it appropriate to get into a discussion (in a restaurant where one really cannot hear fellow diners anyway) about the rightful expectation that a $36 steak would be better than what i might \"fry\" at home from the corner market. Actually, it wasnt even that good.",

It's got a very classic Italian looking cellar-esque vibe going on that I really dig but this place is just too small. You are constantly being bumped into by staff, without apology for your entire dinner. It's almost like bumper karts at an amusement park but you picked the kart that doesn't work and you have to sit there miserably getting slammed by everyone for the duration of your meal. Our waiter had an air about him, and wasn't very polite. No response to please or thank you, just drop off without speaking and on he went. It was all business and he probably didn't care about us because they seemed very under staffed. The bread was good, the wine was good, the salad was fine and the spinach/ricotta ravioli with tomato cream sauce was good but it didn't blow my mind. When I wasn't being slammed into with oil from my salad going all over my sweater it was almost enjoyable.",

The wait staff was bumping into us constantly, spilling drinks on us, and it just didn't make for an enjoyable experience for a rather pricey meal.  Where we sat should not have even been a table. Sadly this is not the first time that I have experienced something like this at Girasole. I am tired of this type of experience at this restaurant, especially after being a customer for many years.  I've found another Italian restaurant in the city with amazing service, great food, and space.  At some point, you just have to say enough is enough. Different leadership might go a really long way.

    "text": "I've been a fan of Girasole since it opened.  I love the quaint, cozy atmosphere and the food has been great 99.5% of the time.  A place for a gathering of friends to chat loudly across the table at each other.  I enjoy both lunch and dinner,  but the evening meal's much more fun.   A seasonal menu offers a variety of traditional dishes, as well as daily specials.  House favorites are the gnocci with mozzarella, polenta with escarole and ravioli are great.  Summertime brings great seafood specials like the seared scallops.  In the fall, definitely try the pumpkin ravioli in a light cream sauce.    With dinner, a glass of wine and dessert, you can drop about $45 per person.  The atmosphere is a modern dressy casual, with jeans, jackets and cute summer dresses.  The one room establishment is small, making intimate conversation difficult when you're practically sitting on top of the table next to you.  Definitely not recommended for parties over four.   In addition, if anyone in your party has difficulty climbing steps, I would suggest going somewhere else.  You need to climb down about 7-8 steps to get inside.  Street parking is available throughout the area, there is also a parking garage and two metered lots one block away.",

    "text": "I like Shadyside because there are so many places to eat.  Some spots are popular, and others (mostly on the side streets) are not.  Regardless of which restaurant you choose, most eating establishments on Walnut Street serve good food. Girasole is an authentic Italian restaurant off the beaten path.  During the summer they have outside seating, if you prefer.  When we arrived, Girasole was half-full.  The space isn't large, and the wait staff, and patrons had a difficult time moving about the restaurant because of the closeness of the tables.  We were seated near a wall with small floor fans (it was muy hot) and began to look over the menu. There were all kinds of Italian classics; Antipasti, Gnocchi, Spaghetti; it all looked good.  We decided to start with the Antipasti Salad.  As we were waiting for our starter, a small basket of bread arrived which we quickly devoured. The Antipasti came, and we quickly dug in.  The plate was covered with Italian olives, prosciutto, marinated artichoke hearts (the real ones, not canned) marinated red peppers, salami, and bean paste.  All of the items on the Antipasti were fresh and delicious; I especially liked the sweet prosciutto, and the bean paste, which was garlicky and perfectly seasoned. For our entrees, we decided on the gnocchi, and Italian chicken with couscous and veggies.  The gnocchi was served with a sweet marinara, and gobs of melted mozzarella. \"Would you like fresh grated cheese sir?\" Yes, of course, and keep it coming. The gnocchi weren't over-cooked.  The potato-pasta held the sauce well, and wasn't too heavy. The Italian chicken was tasty, with large chunks of artichoke hearts as well as other veggies.  The couscous was flavorful, and the red sauce had an extra kick. We enjoyed some homemade tiramisu for dessert; a small portion served with fresh berries and powdered sugar- just enough to satisfy my sweet-tooth. The food at Girasole is carefully prepared and flavorful.  The atmosphere is intimate, and can become a bit loud if you come after 6:30.  The service is good, and the prices are a bit above average. Give Girasole a try if you're in Shadyside, and be sure to try the tiramisu!",

The reason for my 4 star rating is that in my many visits to Girasole, I could rate it a 5 on one visit, and a 3 on the next.  Believe all the reviews about reservations.  Jimmy's friends get seating priority.  He also loses track of who has been waiting longest, so if you take his advice to have a drink next door while you wait, you will be forgotten until you return, and will restart your wait all over again.    Once you get a table, the experience turns more positive.  The beans and greens appetizer is always perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The Girasole salad could be great, but they often dress it too heavily.  Last night I had the lamb shank and saffron risotto entree and it was delicious.  I have never had pasta here that wasn't perfect as well.  Finally, if you get manage to save room for one of their wonderful desserts, do so, as they are consistently great.",

It is tucked away in Shadyside, under, I might add, one of the best places to get ice cream in the city.   We went for lunch, on a weekday, and the place was packed but we were given a table quickly and the service, overall, was fast and friendly. Their lunch menu did not have a lot of options - but I would rather see a place focus on a few items and do them really well than spread themselves over several mediocre offerings. I opted for the potato gnocchi in a marinara with fresh mozzarella and my husband ordered the penne in marinara with roasted chicken... bot of us were really happy with our entrees. For me, the star was the salad. I am never a real fan of salads in restaurants but this one was excellent. The lettuce was fresh and perfectly balanced - garbanzo beans, Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds, shaved red onion, and nicoise olives (the only thing that I left on the plate) dressed with a house sunflower vinaigrette dressing.   I'd certainly recommend this for a casual lunch/dinner -- I really want to head back if only just for the salad! In warmer months they also offer seating outside.... for dessert, head upstairs for some amazing gelatto.",

My mother's friend insisted on going to this place even though I am on a very restricted diet (basically I can only eat meat, fruits, vegetables, and nuts) so an Italian joint did not seem like a good fit. I didn't want to be a jerk, so I said that I'd look at the menu when we got there and then decide. While I'm trying to quietly figure out if I can even eat at this place, the drunk owner starts yelling across the restaurant, \"You don't sit down now, there won't be a table! What the heck you lookin at?! It's good food!\" My mother's friend yells back, \"She's on a special diet!!!!!!\" Embarrassed beyond all belief, I just wanted to leave, but again, my mom's friend insisted on eating here. They were able to work with me (as the owner's son, our waiter, made sarcastic comments about my requests) and the meal that I special ordered was actually very good, but I still wish that we hadn't given our money to such a trashy owner and his son. I personally would not go back, even though the food was fantastic.",

    "text": "The first facial expression that I saw--a smile--as I walked up to Girasole, a Shadyside neighborhood Italian-inspired place, added promise to a departing customer's words, \"We'll come back.\"   In Italian, girasole is the word for that showy flower whose dark face twists at the sun and perhaps it was my love for sunflowers or perhaps the comfortable-looking seating that lead me to eat al fresco. At other outside tables, pairs of women lunched, gossiping and flashing diamonds while at other tables, men in shorts lounged with their knees spread. Waitresses hurried between tables. Nearly every customer wore black sunglasses.   I put on my own sunglasses while the host (and owner?) greeted and seated me, and then collected my order. I've been to Girasole a few times previous and feel that the service is perfunctory if the staff doesn't know the customer, but warm and caring when the customer is a regular. A waitress brought me a basket of crusty Italian bread, followed by Girasole's house salad, a mix of greens topped with blue cheese, chick peas, kalamata olives (with a pleasant bite!), vinaigrette, and trademark sunflower seeds. After the salad, I was served polenta with mozzarella, escarole, and cannellini beans: a peasant dish that balances a light red sauce with bitter-ish escarole, and with rich cannellini and mozzarella. I notice that Girasole gets mixed reviews here on Yelp for quality and portion-size, but each visit I've ordered the polenta and found it well-executed and too much for one meal (I take home the sauce and later serve it over pasta).  When I departed, I said to the host with a smile, \"Thank you. I'll come back.\"",

As many have mentioned before, the restaurant is really small (think twice about coming without a reserve on a weekend!).  The tables are closely packed, and much like communal seating, you'll become quickly aquainted with your neighboring diners :) That being said, the intimate ambience also gives it a romantic vibe, and while you enjoy the deliciousness that will be served to you, you will soon forget about the close quarters.  We tried the pumpkin ravioli (creamy, semi sweet and salty with a hint of sage) and the polenta (baked with escarole and mozzarella), and paired it with the San Calisto Montepulciano.  I am absolutely in love with the vinaigrette that sits atop their house salad- question for the owners, do you bottle and sell the dressing?! I will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "I struggled with a star rating for Girasole.  Overall, I'm a definite fan of the restaurant and will be back for sure.  Here's a couplepointers for people though if you're considering going.  1) Call a day or two ahead and plan on going to dinner a little on the early side 6/6:30 if you want to not wait a while.  The place doesn't take reservations, so you need to get your name on their list for any given night as soon as possible. 2) They maximized their use of their small space. There really didn't feel like a whole lot of breathing room between many of the tables, so if you're going in winter, layer up and maybe not wear your bulkiest winter coat.   Ok, now for why you're actually reading this review, the food and environment.  Yeah, Girasole was a little loud, but for the space they have (and i'm sure they have more tables out outside in the summer), it's a tucked away gem. It's quaint and cozy for all its crampedness and I give the waitress my girlfriend and i had a pass because of the busyness. We were there for our anniversary dinner. We both got the the soup of the day, the Chicken Pastina soup, which was simple but very comforting and warmed our bones on the cold night. She got the Pumpkin Ravioli, which drew rave reviews from both of us (go with the brown butter sauce) and is a delectable dish my brain is still trying to comprehend.  I got the Linguine Rustic, which was quite good but missed a little final \"kick\" of flavor (i didn't notice the garlic in the dish that much and there seemed to be a bit too much oil on the bottom, like the chef had plated up just a smidge too much of the sauce) which i remedied by adding a little pepper.  It wasn't overly salty, like another review on here has mentioned, but it just didn't have that final \"wow\", and was more of a \"that was a solid pasta dish...i'd get that again\" dish.  Overall 4 out of 5 stars.  It's worth checking out and I'll for sure go back.",

    "text": "If I could give this place no stars, I would.   My boyfriend and I made a reservation at this place a week in advance after several recommendations from or friends. We arrived early to our time and were seated promptly by the owner, who acted as the host.   Unfortunately, our table for two was buried between the wall and three other larger-party tables. At first, it didn't seem too bad, comical even, to have other people shift around to let us shimmy into our seats. However, as the night wore on, our patience grew thinner as even the waiter could not walk over to our table. The staff had to pass dishes through the other table of 8 to ours. My boyfriend had to stand and walk over to the blocked space between two tables where the waiter met him and took our order. I did not speak a single word to the waiter the whole evening.   The food itself was decent. We ordered the bruschetta and the spinach and ricotta ravioli. The ravioli came with what appeared to be tomato soup, nothing too extraordinary. I was too turned off by the poor seating arrangement and lack of care to appreciate the dishes for what they were.   At the end of our meal, after the large party had left, we asked the waiter to speak to the manager. The host from the front came over and we began to voice our complaints. Before I could even finish my first sentence about the horrible service, Mr. Gerasole interrupted me to brag about his restaurant having operated for 17 years. He went on, saying that his face on the waiter's shirts, he wasn't going to \"win\" with us, and how we shouldn't  have any complaints with the food. When we tried to speak up again, he stopped us again, shaking his head condescendingly and sighing exasperatedly. My boyfriend, who doesn't usually voice his concerns, began to argue with him, begging him to please listen to and understand our concerns. All we got in response was his laughter. I told him this was no laughing matter and he got upset and forceful with his words. He told me that if I had had a problem with the table, I should've said something in the beginning rather than waiting the entire meal to speak up. I had placed a reservation a week in advance, showed up early to my allotted time, was hungry and did not want to wait for another table. What would even be the point in making a reservation? When we asked whether he was blaming us for the poor service, he denied vehemently. Then, he asked us what he could do and I said you could pick up our check. He responded with laughter again, saying that it would be useless since it would do nothing for his establishment. I lost all respect for this man at this point. He offered to buy us a drink or a dessert when we no longer had the appetite nor wanted to spend another minute sitting there in his restaurant.  The absolute worst cherry on top of the whole damned experience was his racist commentary at the end of the night. As we were waiting for the gift certificate he so graciously offered after refusing to cover our check, he started smiling and saying that Indians were good negotiators. This was obviously directed at my boyfriend, who didn't react. I spoke up, saying that I disagreed and did not feel his comment was appropriate. Immediately, Mr. Gerasole rolled his eyes, let out a huge sigh, and said \"here we go again\". He then bent over and said to me \"This is going to be tough, but I bet you I can guess your nationality\". I couldn't take it anymore. My boyfriend stopped him there and as soon as we got the certificate, we walked out.   Mr. Gerasole, a word of advice. Listen to your customers, treat them with respect, and show some humility. Not only did you ruin my date night, but you also imparted an unnecessary burden on that unfortunate middle table as well. I hope no other customer has to tolerate the treatment that we experienced. You're right. I will not be back.",

The \"pink\" sauce as I call it reminded me of an amazing old world Italian joint in Hoboken NJ whose vodka creme sauce remains as the best I've ever had.   Service was great and the bread was incredibly fresh.  Very tight quarters, however, and I was a little put off by the messiness around the kitchen which I passed on the way to the bathroom.   Other than that, it's definitely worth a meal or two when your are in and/or around Shadyside.",

Back to our weekly date night location as a married, harried, and growing couple.   Sure, there are tons of hip new restaurants popping up where you can get squid egg foam over crostada and herb gastrique or whatever the cool phrase is in Brooklyn...but this place remains a constant source of amazingly prepared food, in a unique setting. Is it loud sometimes? Sure. So were the restaurants we visited in basements and stone walled spaces in Florence. Is it cramped? Sure, sometimes it is, but it's a small location and the kitchen rains consistently spectacular because they are cooking for a small number. It's not the olive Garden / Lidia's / Bravo where you have an acre between your guest. I'll take perfectly prepared, home made Italian where I have to bump elbows with my neighbor any day over canned gravy and a ton of space. (Last time I was at a smaller table, the group of four next to me included two members of the Penguins...so the proximity was actually kind of fun.)  Jimmy, Patti, Vito and their family have been bringing delicious, authentic food for 20+ years in an area that is becoming increasingly inauthentic and commercialized. Thank you all for being a Shadyside tradition! And see you tomorrow for the risotto. :)",

Very cramped inside (I had to continuously move my chair in and was repeatedly bumped by waitstaff who never apologized). We had to wait outside for a while before being seated. The food was a let-down, but only because of the hype I had heard. It was okay, but just okay. The dessert was good, but nothing was worth the price. I hear they have a vocalist some nights, maybe we'll go back for that and dessert, maybe a glass of wine, but only if we're in the area. Overall, okay, but not stellar.",

Don't skip the appetizers and don't mind the close eating quarters. The low lighting and the low rumble of close conversation adds to the romantic atmosphere.

We were seated 40 minutes past our 8:30pm reservation without any type of apology or real acknowledgement. At one point the host nastily said \"I cant force people out of seats\" when a member of our party went to check on the wait. 2. They randomly offered some of our party wine while we were waiting, the host asked \"red or white?\" and brought out some glasses of house wine while we were waiting on the sidewalk. Then charged us for them. It was such a strange thing to us since he both offered and gave us very little option in what we were offered to add them to our bill at the end of the night. 3. They were also out of tiramisu.    Overall not impressed.",

Food was great, and the service was wonderful! I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli (x2!) which came with a house salad.

Also, to fit the crowd, patrons were packed in, 3 people at 2 man tables, table of 6 in a 4 man table, etc.  stuff was getting knocked off the table left and right with The lack of room.  I counted at least 3 breakages.  Would I come back? Only on an 'off' day.  Oh, one other thing. The wait staff has a habit of yelling to each other across the room.

Late spring, strolling along the cobblestone streets window shopping when the sky darkens, and the clouds open up. Huddled under an umbrella, his arm around you to warm you from the sudden chill, you scamper down the few steps and duck into the warmth of Girasole.  You're immediately greeted like family; with a glow in the background as if a huge fire were burning. The small space is filled with lovely folks laughing, and sharing wine; eyes twinkling as they listen to the live music being played by the gentleman walking around strumming his guitar singing loudly.  The menu is simply simple Italian. The wine list is the sweet red table wine offered immediately after you sit down. The desserts are so worthy of the extra calories. Home made and delightful.   Almost as tasty as that good night kiss.",

    "text": "I reccomend Girasole to anyone who wants to try something different and not empty their wallets. It's the perfect date night restaurant. I've been here many times, sometimes for lunch, other times for dinner. I prefer to go there for lunch.  They have a rotating menu that incorporates seasonal ingredients. For example, the fall menu has pumpkin ravioli in a sage cream sauce, whereas their summer menu features squid ink linquini in a light cream sauce with lobster. (both are delicious!)  My \"tried and True\" at Girasole is the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a tomato cream sauce. I always end up sopping up the extra sauce with my bread. Don't judge me.    Every pasta entree comes with unlimited bread and the \"girasole\" salad, which is topped with gorgonzola, garbanzo beans and sunflower seeds. Yum! (If you do not like onions, be sure to request to have them removed from the salad, otherwise you will be tasting them all night).   All in all, Girasole is one of my favorite restaurants in town. I docked it a perfect rating because after several weekend dinner reservations, my party was ALWAYS forced to wait over an hour. I understand that at a small business, wait times can be unpredictable. But there are other small(er!) restaurants in Pittsburgh that do not have this problem. I believe that up to a thirty minute wait is acceptable. But an hour each time? No.  Either stop accepting reservations or change the way you accept patrons.   This is why I really like their lunch. The prices are cheaper, the portions are absolutely perfect, and it is never crowded.",

    "text": "OVERALL: Given the popularity of Girasole, I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.  SERVICE: Despite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.  FOOD: Disappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start.   Fortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.  My steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned.   Desserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.  AMBIANCE:  Probably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.  FINAL VERDICT: Probably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss.",

We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it, but it was just really crowded.

Once seated servers are pleasant and nice,  The food is poor. Verges on disgusting. I had their much-beloved squid ink linguine with lobster. The pasta was mushy--way overcooked. Far too much cream and cheese. Lobster meat suspiciously tasted like it was recently thawed out from a frozen state. Didn't finish this dish.  My wife had a chicken special. Dry. Boring. Bland.  Maybe we just had a bad experience (it was a busy Friday night 8pm). The popularity of the place and the plethora of positive reviews and high ratings indicates that this might have some great moments, but unfortunately not this time.",

Seems to get busy and loud during lunch, and the space is pretty limited, so I'd advise making a reservation.  The  ravioli were quite delicious, and their sauces have very distinctive flavours.  Ingredients were fresh, and everything tasted homemade like a good ol trattoria. Service was friendly and very efficient even during rush hour. Definitely recommending it, and would love to come back next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a nice place to celebrate our 23rd anniversary. Researched various reviews on Yelp and finally decided to try Girasole. We arrived at around 7:30 on a Saturday evening to find a full restaurant, but our timing was apparently good because we were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant is small and seating is tight. This is not unusual for Shadyside however and was to be expected. Being a Saturday night there was quite a bit of noise and it was a little hard 2 have a conversation over dinner. On a positive note it was clear that everyone was enjoying their time and the food that we saw being ordered looked terrific.   The menu is simple consisting of a limited number of rustic pasta dishes as well as daily specials. We ordered an appetizer of beans and greens with homemade sausage which was very popular as everyone else around us also was ordering it. For good reason as it was absolutely delicious. For entrees I ordered Gnocchi, which were light and fluffy and came in a delicious tomato sauce with bits of fresh mozzarella cheese infused through it.  Simple,  but really good,  one of the better pasta dishes I have had in a restaurant in some time.  My wife ordered a filet mignon special.  The steak was cooked to order and was nice and juicy, but a little under seasoned according to my wife. It sat on a base of truffle infused mashed potatoes and was topped with roasted portobello mushrooms. Delicious at $35. Entrees come with a  house Salad,  dressed with a simple Italian dressing.  Fresh and tasty.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but personally would probably consider coming back on a weeknight when perhaps it was not so busy.",

    "text": "Girasole is a small Italian restaurant off Walnut Street that serves up decent Italian food.  I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  Most patrons appear to be late 20's/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  Tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  I'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  Anyways, on with the food.  Their menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  Everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  Their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 PM).  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  I ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.  While we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  Butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.  The wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  I picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and I don't like my salads soggy.  The ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  It was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  The pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  The steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.  I've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and I don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.  I would probably recommend Lydia's over Girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either.",

I even called the day before our reservation to confirm and was told we were all set. We arrived 10 minutes before the reservation to people waiting on the sidewalk to be seated with every table filled. The owner was confrontational when told him we had a reservation and said he could not kick people out of their seats. He took our phone number and said he would call us when a table was ready...he never called. Basically, reservations mean nothing here. Even if the food is great, the customer service is terrible. Pittsburgh has a lot of other fantastic restaurants, don't bother with this one.",

There were people seated from as close to the kitchen and all the way up the stairs by the sidewalk. There were hopefuls milling about a bit to get down and place their name for a seating. When we were able to reach the desk, the wait time was 50 minutes.  We went to Mercurio's for a while, took a stroll around Walnut, and eventually sat down by some very convenient benches nearby. After what we thought was 'adequate' wait time, we peered a bit over the fence and down towards the man (who we think may have been the owner). After a bit, he nodded at us, and started moving a couple of tables around inside. We took that as a signal, meaning, \"Come on down. I'm wrestling these tables apart for you.\"  We ordered the carne special (steak with alfredo for $30) and the torcia ($15). I wouldn't say that they were the best that i'd ever had, but they were pretty good. The vegetables are fresh; the pasta was just right and sauced/souped enough to my liking. The service, provided mostly by Diane, was excellent. She was friendly and attentive, despite the throngs of customers. The crowds are loud, the atmosphere very.. cozy.. and the walkways very narrow, and, yet, the food and drinks keep coming, accident-free. It seems like it could be highly stressful for the servers, but Diane was smiling every time she came back. Awesome.",

Given that we arrived shortly after 4pm, I doubted this place would be busy--and it wasn't--which worked out perfectly, in light of this place's size and popularity during normal dinner hours on the weekend.  Based on the recommendation of my labmate and other Yelpers, I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, and it didn't disappoint.  The pasta was perfectly tender without being mushy, and the filling was savory and delicious.  As Rachel C. pointed out in her review, this place is quite generous with the sauce, which is great because this was the best part of the dish!  It was a tomato cream sauce that was delicious in its own right, but that complemented the savoriness of the ravioli fillings well.  After finishing my raviolis, I asked for some more bread and used it to sop up the remainder of the sauce.  My dish also came with the Girasole salad--a tossed salad dressed with sunflower seeds (how cute, in light of the meaning of the restaurant's name!)--that served as a great appetizer to the meal.  About the only part of my meal that wasn't noteworthy was the bread, which was fine, but just your standard Italian bread.  Since he wasn't as hungry as me, my dining companion ordered the bruschetta, which also came with a salad.  It wasn't your standard bruschetta, however--it consisted of what looked like chopped squash with prosciutto on toasted flatbread.  I'm not sure how much he enjoyed it, since he left a fair amount of the squash and prosciutto on his plate.  However, I wouldn't count this as a strike against the dish or the restaurant, since he can be a pretty picky eater.  I didn't taste the bruschetta in its entirety, so I can't pass my own judgment on it, unfortunately.  As others have mentioned, the dining area is definitely small and intimate, and the tables are quite close to one another.  However, this wasn't a problem for us since the restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we were dining, due to being there on an off hour.  We really liked the ambience, which I'd describe as rustic but classy, and it didn't feel like basement dining even though it was.  The waitstaff all seemed quite jovial with one another, which was fun to observe.  I have no complaints about the service we received.  Overall, we had a nice experience here, and would definitely return.  Given the popularity of this place, if you want to avoid some of the problems mentioned in other reviews due to the small space, I'd recommend going for lunch or during an off time.  This is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at thus far in PGH, so if you're in the mood for this type of food, give it a try!",

It started out great; we had a reservation and were seated and served right away with friendly service.  I ordered the chicken of the day (walnut chicken with butternut squash ravioli). The chicken was very standard, nothing special, but the butternut squash ravioli was absolutely delicious! Sadly, the chicken was the main part of the meal and the ravioli, a side. I got to try some of their tiramisu, and it wasn't the best, but it was still delightful and surprisingly light.   But afterwards, around rush time, the small restaurant filled up quickly. The servers stopped coming around, it got real loud, and people kept bumping into you. It gets hard to maneuver around to the restroom as well. They finally got around to grabbing us the check, but told our big group to split it amongst ourselves, do the math, and write it all down for them to run. It took forever to get it around to everybody. It would have been much easier if they split it for us ( I know how much of a hassle it is, I have worked at restaurants for years. But we were a group of young adults. If it were me, I would have known everybody would have wanted separate checks and have had it ready ).  Overall, it was an okay experience!",

I had read that reservations are sometimes hard to secure, but my boyfriend and I walked in around 6:30 and were seated immediately by the owner.   The atmosphere is great - definitely a little loud, but we had no issue hearing each other over the chatter. Really cool copper dining tables and stone walls. The highlight of our meal was the polpette appetizer - meatballs with tomatoes, chick peas, creamy tomato sauce and topped with marscapone. Absolutely delicious and tastes unlike any other Italian dish I've had. We also really enjoyed our entrees (chicken special of the night - stuffed chicken over risotto and brussel sprout hash) and our cocktails. Word to the wise - the \"Stormy Root\" cocktail is delicious but the Jamaica's finest ginger beer is harsh! Only order if you're ready for a strong drink with a real bite.  We will definitely be back - our total was just over $100 for four cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees and our server, Kristen, was wonderful. Great experience overall!",

Small and often cramped with clamoring patrons, loud because people are actually talking to each other and not on cell phones, yelling because it is a family run business. For those out there who have never been to an Italian Sunday dinner, this is not the place for you. Out of this wold wafting from Chef Jen's kitchen.    Girasole has charm, family, excellent food and the biggest hearted proprietors in the city.  Along with everyday lunches and dinners I have had a baby shower their, birthday dinners, and funeral lunches. When a family member wad in Shadyside Hospital and could only eat Girasole gnocci with butter and cheese, they always had it ready for a quick pick up.   When O leave Girasole's, I not only feel like I've eaten one of the best meals of my. , life, but also that I have just had a fantastic experience.",

Starting with the cozy but lively ambience and a delightful welcome from Patti, their take on modern Italian cuisine impressed all of us. Our festive table had diverse tastes including carnivores, picky vegetarians, adventurous epicureans and lactose-averse diners but they satisfied us all.  Vito, our charming and efficient server, patiently provided recommendations and the chef accommodated all our needs creatively.  I highly recommend first sampling any of their delicious appetizers with their well-blended cocktails. Be sure to order the antipasto- the Prosciutto was delicate and melted in my mouth. Later, Vito helped us choose perfect wine pairings with our meal.  His service throughout the night was unparalleled.   We selected entrees from both the seasonal menu as well as items from the daily specials.  All of the entrees were served in generous portions. I had the chance to try many dishes that evening and all of them were exquisite. Cocoa fettuccine, black truffle ravioli and the fish special (Salmon and lobster crepes with Gruyere) were especially tantalizing.   Special thanks to Patti, who went out of her way to be attentive to our needs. We are already planning our next visit to this wonderful restaurant.",

Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....  Had the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa.",

With  excellent food and service, you can't help but fall in love with this place as I have.  The dishes are prepared with Italian love and care. The service is pleasant and cheerful. The decor and atmosphere invites a guest to stay as long as possible.  Although being a smaller restaurant they do fill up quickly, because of word of mouth popularity, and excellent food, so reservations are highly recommended. The food is well worth the wait on a long waiting list.   The Gnocchi dish is to die for !!  They offer an excellent small wine list by the bottle. A few by the glass, but the bottle is so well worth it to complement any dish you choose.   I am on the email newsletter list and keep up to date on all the specials and new menu's.    Adoro questo ristorante !!",

Ambience was very old school Italian with copper table tops and grotto like room.  Service was very good.  Wine was good (I had the Pinot Noir) but a little pricey at $13 per glass.  They do allow you to taste the wine before you commit to ordering it.  I had the breaded veal chop for dinner ($40).  The flavor was very good but the chop was noticeably dark and overcooked on one side and probably shouldn't have been served.  The meat was very tender but a little on the overcooked side.  Probably would have been moister if they didn't overcook the one side.  They of course served the overcooked side face down (disappointing).  The bruschetta appetizer was very good. The mussel appetizer was average.  My wife had the ravioli ($27) and she said it was very good.  One of our party had the cocoa fettucine with pistachio, cauliflower and gorgonzola.  He said it was very good.  Another ordered the gnocchi and I had a bite and thought it was good.  We shared coconut cake, tiramisu and cheesecake for deserts and all were excellent.  I would definitely go again especially to see what the new menu has and also to see if the dinners were consistent from one day/season to another.  Overall I think the value was average for the prices.  Not great but not bad.  Hopefully my next time the rating will go up to 5 stars.",

    "text": "I have tried to like his place. The food is average for Italian. The bolognese is flavorful, the duck was good, but the ravioli are watery. If it was just on food alone, I would probably give it a better score. My biggest issue is that the owner is so unprofessional. It is a good old boy's establishment. Every time I've been here, I have seen him move his buddies with no reservations ahead of numerous reservation holders. I know, because last night I was with one of his buddies. We skipped the whole line. It was embarrassing, I thought we had reservations.   I heard him on two separate occasions try to talk people out of waiting for a table. Rather than saying \"it is a two hour wait\" and letting the patron decide, he was rude and  the comments were \"we don't have time for you.\"  Then, he asked a couple in the middle of their meal to relocate so that he could seat a large party.   Finally, he yells at his staff. Not just a little snip. Screams at them. This is a tiny restaurant. Everyone can hear. He had assigned a waitress 16 people at once, at multiple tables. She was overwhelmed. He screamed at her for 5 minutes in front of everyone.   The food is not that good to get away with treating patrons and staff that way. It was uncomfortable to watch. He has single handedly ruined every experience at the restaurant. I don't care if he is the owner, someone needs to teach him how to be respectful and professional. It is an embarrassment. Go to Alla Famiglia. Better Italian, and you won't get screamed at.",

I am very aware of the limited seating so when I called today for a reservation I clearly inquired if the host was actually taking my name and would honor the request for a table for 2 at 7:30. The owner assured me that he was taking my name and if we didn't have immediate seating it would be a 15 minute maximum wait. Upon arrival the owner did not have our name and rudely stated that due to the limited seating we would just need to wait our turn. He took our phone number and never called us, as promised. I hope that I will remember this unprofessional management, despite the fact that I so enjoy dining in this neighborhood establishment, and I will sadly not any return time soon.",

We lucked out when the wineglass-toting host was able to seat us within a few minutes of entering.  My Italian wedding soup was delicious, but I was a little underwhelmed by my entree. My fish was a little tough, the arugula pesto was a bit too salty for my taste, and the lobster risotto was a little bland. I may have just ordered the wrong dish.  Aside from my lackluster entree, the accommodating service, hearty soup, and and alluring atmosphere still make this restaurant an excellent choice for a cool evening out in Shadyside.  I will be returning to Girasole and hope that I'll have an entree that will inspire me to bump up my rating!",

She was very accommodating.  We ordered our appetizers, I split the beans and greens with sausage with my significant other.  Hard to go wrong with this appetizer.  We then ordered our main course and I went with one of my favorites, Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli that comes in a tomato cream sauce.   The pasta's rock at Girasole.   You get the soup or house salad with your meal.  I had the salad because it is one of the fresher and better salads in the area.  The salad has a combination of fresh greens, some chickpeas, olive and a great house made dressing.   If you are in a hurry and don't want to dine this is not your place.  We came with a small group to enjoy the food and each others company but one in our group kept wondering about the time and was annoying.  Just come enjoy the food and the people you are with.",

The food was excellent -- three of us had orecchiette pasta with marinara sauce, one had mussels, and one had ravioli.Seasonings were excellent, and portions were large. The house salads or soup that came with the pasta dishes were wonderful. We enjoyed our waiter; he was quick and friendly. Prices were very reasonable. So why the three stars? The restaurant was packed and incredibly noisy. But that's not the problem. The problem was a guitarist who went around the room, singing old popular songs at the top of his lungs (he probably had to to be heard) and frequently off key. We had trouble talking across the table even when he wasn't singing, but as soon as he started up again, conversation simply had to stop. It was incredibly annoying to us and to others in the restaurant -- there was quite a bit of eye rolling going on. I really enjoyed the food at Girasole, but will probably never go back, which is really too bad.",

I have lived in shadyside for almost two years but only heard about this place last month and I am so thankful for the random girl from my friends party that told me about this place! You don't find places like this everywhere. Especially not in Pittsburgh. The appetizer (veal meatballs) was outstanding. It came in a savory sauce with a nice side of raisin bread of some sort. The pasta was homemade and perfect. I got the linguini and my boyfriend got the ravioli and we were blown away by it all. Not to mention the vegetable bisque soup that came with our meals. So yummy and even better with the bread they served upon being seated. I even ordered dessert here which I often don't do. But I got chocolate mouse cake and it was to die for!!!! I ate the entire thing. Fruit, whipped cream and all. I am not ashamed. We can't wait to come back here and try more menu items. The live music was a great touch. If you don't like louder places with lots of chatter and music then you may want to turn away; but you will be making the biggest mistake of your life if you do. The lively atmosphere and kind staff paired with amazing food was the perfect Sunday evening date. Highly recommend.",

Not a lot of pasta options and those that were on the menu weren't homemade.   It's unlikely I will return because the food was mediocre, the service was very slow and the prices were high.",

I called ahead to make sure it was okay to bring a young child at dinner time and was told enthusiastically to definitely come. There are many vegetarian options and they are very tasty. Everyone from the host to the servers are attentive and kind. The ambiance is lovely, and the atmosphere is lively yet cozy. It's one of my favorites in Shadyside!",

We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle.",

    "text": "I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.  It was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting. The owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar. Finally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations, walked in after us, but knew the owner. Very poor form on the owners part. 2. He said we would \"be taken care of\". I was thinking maybe an appetizer or wine, something for promising us a table with reservations and then having us wait for over an hour. But when the bill came there was none of that. We still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Oh how I wanted to like this place, I love little restaurants like this, the rustic stone walls, the small tables, etc, they do have one drawback, when busy, they can get LOUD and this place gets very LOUD.  Service - Aloof, unknowledgeable, friendly, but overall you would probably get more professional service at your local IHOP than we did. I asked for a pronunciation on the menu, they didn't know, I asked about a product, said they were unsure what it was, and then we had to ask for the bill from a busboy after waiting and waiting for a long time. 2 Stars  Value - NO, sorry this place is expensive and the food does not match the price. We split an appetizer, had two entrees and one ice tea bill was $64 and one of the entrees was simple Polenta. 2 Stars  Food - Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, but when you pay $30 for an entree you expect a really well prepared and executed entree. In this case I had traditional osso bucco, the shank was excellent, the marrow delicious, the risotto Milanese over-cooked and sub par. The polenta entree was good, but the polenta was actually very plain tasting and covered with a slice of mozzarella cheese. Salads were horrendously over-dressed and our appetizer was $13 for one sausage link and a pear and taleggio crepe, it was good, probably the best dish of the meal, but I had to marvel at the cost. 3.5 stars  Bottom Line: 2.5 stars.",

Its basement space just off Walnut in Shadyside is cute when you're looking for a romantic restaurant, but quickly seems overcrowded when you have more than a few tables full. It's especially bad for a large crowd (I brought a party of 12 from my dorm one time, and they really struggled to set up tables for us). A friend has told me he's had issues getting them to honor table reservations, too...  On the bright side, the food is reliably very good, and the prices aren't even very high. There's sometimes live entertainment, which can either be annoying and too loud or fun and festive, depending on your expectations. I love that they have seasonal menus! I'm still thinking about last year's pumpkin ravioli...",

The Owner/host responded by shrugging and showing me a random piece of paper. I told him I didn't know what that meant and he laughed. Apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated. I told him I was just asking how long the wait was and he responded that he was sorry it didn't say it right. My husband and I left and I said we wouldn't be coming back. He shouted out the door at us with a full restaurant and a large wait \"What the hell is wrong with you.\"  I'm generally not one to make a scene and I regularly go to busy places, but I really felt like the response we received here was super rude.  In a city with expanding options it's too bad this establishment can't provide better service, even if they won't be able to seat us.",

The ambiance is neat, but like all other reviewers have said, it gets loud.  I think it contributes to a classy, European feel though.  My boyfriend and I don't talk too much when we eat so the noise wasn't a problem.  I had the spaghettini which has spinach and clams.  It was watery, but didn't water down the taste so it's forgivable.  My boyfriend had the ravioli (I forget what the filling was, but I don't think it was vegetarian).  The sauce with the ravioli -- a vodka-type sauce -- was tasty and great for dipping bread.  Despite NOT ordering the cheapest items on the menu, we were still perceived as cheap college students (maybe we should've dressed up a little?).  The waitress gave us the check immediately after we finished without interesting us in coffee or dessert.  A shame.  We were planning to order tiramisu, but we decided to watch our waists anyway and just paid and left.  Tsk tsk.",

The decor is very nice, with exposed brick and beautiful paintings. The tables are extremely close together, while this provides and intimate atmosphere it is quite hard to navigate to the restroom or when leaving. The menu was very small. I had the spinach ravioli which was excellent. The house salad that comes with the dinner was great--dressing was homemade and delicious. The service was pretty good.

    "text": "Love finding these hole in the wall spots in my backyard, I call Pittsburgh. My friend had taken photos for Pittsburgh Magazines Blog, and demanded I go and try it. Let me tell you, Italy has arrived in this place. The owner, was there during our time and they display outside seating, as well as indoors. Their indoor seating is I feel below street level with brick walls, and community art hanging on the wall. Which rumor has it, you can buy.  As recommended I made a reservation, and was seated immediately. Big up, right there not including the atmosphere, very rustic, very homey Italian to me. We were greeted by our server, and I ordered a water with one of their \"special, owner loves this drink\" my friend ordered another specialty drink. I noticed the prices and strayed away from the appetizers, so I could order my entree and dessert. When our bread arrived I noticed this neat little oil holder, it was shaped like a jug, with a grape mold that held the balsamic vinegar. I WANT that thing. I almost walked away with it, pocket pinched it, but here comes running; in my conscious, knowing that my awful deed would have split all over my purse, knowing my luck. Any-hoo, haven't met a place to go wrong with bread. My drink that I ordered wasn't my kind of drink, there were bitters involved, and my taste buds and bitters don't get along. I told the waitress, and she agreed and said not everybody likes the drink, I'll take it off your bill, and I ordered another, which was amazing.  As for their menu, they do have specials that coincide with the season. They have to make a bang for their buck, can I please recommend they print that seasonal menu on another kind of paper..other than computer paper?! I was a little bummed out about that. I ordered the cocoa fettuccine, with pistachios, leeks, cauliflower, and Gorgonzola. This is a late post, but I can still taste this pasta. HOUSE MADE pasta, you can't go wrong. This pasta was just amazing. absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering as I type, Now you know this is a good place, if I'm drooling. The love I have for this restaurant is intensified if you have tried their spinach and ricotta ravioli, in this creamy tomato sauce. That you could tell was authentic, or well their own recipe. I seriously can't get enough of this place. On to dessert, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry gelato. Real chunks of raspberry and white chocolate, it was just an awesome ending to a great meal. This hole in the wall is the place to be.",

    "text": "I was looking for a spot for my coworkers and I to have lunch in Shadyside and came across Girasole. I had never heard anything about it before, but it was close to our office and had decent reviews, so we decided to check it out!  Upon arriving, I realized that I had walked past this charming little place many times without noticing it! It is directly next to Eden, and is right off of Walnut. I LOVED the entire feel of this cozy little place. The sunflower door handles, the stone walls, charming art work and unique bronze colored tables all made me feel like I was stepping into a little corner restaurant in Italy! It is very tiny inside- I felt lucky to be visiting during a non-busy time of 11:30 am and not a Friday night at 7pm.   Our server was friendly but did not give EXTRAordinary service. I felt as if she was a little rushed with us as she took our orders and did not speak entirely clear. My co-worker had to ask for clarification a couple times when it came to the question, \"Soup or salad?\" because she had asked it so quickly. My other co-worker also wasn't impressed when she reached over one of our plates in order to retrieve another plate. I, on the other hand, am pretty forgiving with minor mistakes and did not take offense to that at all. She was attentive to our table, refilled our waters when needed and cleared the table of our dirty plates as soon as we finished our salads/meals.   I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli. We had the option of soup or salad with our lunch and I chose the salad. The salad wasn't very large, but consisted of spring greens, thin slices of red onions, pine nuts, chickpeas, one baby tomato, an olive and shredded carrots. I found the vinaigrette to be wonderful- light but packed with flavor. The pine nuts really added a much needed crunch to the salad as well. Our table was also served a small basket of bread. The bread was fresh and fluffy and very good, but nothing spectacular.  The spinach and ricotta ravioli was delicious! The ravioli were rather large and only came with 4 for the lunch portion. It was plenty though! raviolis were filled with spinach and ricotta and were cooked perfectly.The sauce was creamy and packed with delicious flavor. As many other yelpers mentioned, they were heavy on the sauce, which I LOVED. I really enjoyed dipping my bread in the sauce and eating forkfuls of it- very tasty!  Will be back!",

The waiter/waitress plates your dessert after handling money.  Do you know how dirty money is? But after watching that could you at least but a fork in front of a person instead of leaving 4 forks on the dessert plate and never bringing a share plate out.  The food was ok., even though 2 of the orders came out wrong. Mistakes happen In the beginning of any new job. The starter salad is delicious. We had a appetizer that was also very good.

I had the Risotto, which had spicy sausage medallions and red/yellow peppers and onions. The risotto was just soft enough and melted in your mouth. It was a perfect dish of buttery and spicy and was worth the bit of cold weather to get there. As I drank my Chianti and some local root beer, the place filled up with people of all ages and lively conversation. I ended the night with the white chocolate almond panna cotta..forgive me if I don't spell it right...basically a smooth, rich velvety custard with whip creme and blueberries and a little biscotti on the side..amazing!

Everything else about this place is bad, but not bad enough to keep us away permanently.  1) Location. It's horrible. It's in a basement and is very very very small. The tables are extremely close together (you're practically sitting on top of the people next to you and sharing conversations). It makes for an uncomfortable meal if you can't get over it.  2) Parking. I just hate street parking (parallel parking, what?) There's a parking garage up the street on Bellefonte which is fine if the weather is nice. One time we did it in the frigid cold and that was dumb. Lol.  4) The wait staff is slow and every time we go they've been extremely un-attentive. Never count on a drink refill here.  5) Their house salad is weird. I'm a simple girl. I like a basic salad (with ranch which they don't have). Girasole's salad is a mixed green with sunflower vinaigrette topped with sunflower seeds. I just don't like it.  It's better than olive garden in some respects, I guess.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants I've tried in Pittsburgh! My friends and I ordered bruschetta and aioli mussels for appetizer and both were great! For the main course I got the linguine rustic. I imagined the portion to be small, but it turned out to be a good size. It was delicious as well, no surprise there (: the main course also came with either a salad or chickpea & sausage soup. I got the soup and loved it, but if you're not a fan of tomato-based soups then it might not be for you.   Overall, I had a great time there. Although the place was a little small and the tables are pretty close to each other, it still felt very cosy and welcoming. Definitely come here if you're looking for good Italian food!",

The atmosphere was okay and the restaurant was very crowded and cramped. It is byob but there is a $7 corkage fee per person (quite hefty). I got the linguine rustic and I can not recommend it. However, my friends' food looked a lot better but my dish was watery and bland tasting. Not only was the dish unappealing but the prices are definitely on the more expensive end.",

Yes the restaurants was crowded and people were seated on top of each other. The wait staff was fine. Beware this restaurant is not handicapped accessible. The owner did help my husband with his walker and he was gracious.  I have been to much better Italian restaurants and I won't be going back to this one.",

    "text": "This place has been on my want-to-go-there list for nearly as long as its been open.  I've since moved away from Shadyside, making it more and more unlikely that I'd ever go.  I was meeting a friend for dinner in the area last week - dinner location was up to me, and, when searching restaurants in the area on Yelp, Girasole popped up and I thought \"ah, here's my chance!\"    I called ahead for reservations - that was probably a smart move - it was pretty busy.  Dinner was AMAZING.  My friend got the spinach ricotta ravioli and I got the linguine rustic.  The starting salads were really good - the toppings added a great flavor to the greenery and the dressing was nice.  But my dinner - I was blown away by my dinner.  This was probably the best clam-sauce pasta dish I have ever had.  My mother used to make pasta with clam sauce when I was younger, so generally, if a restaurant has it available, I get it.  Most places, however, don't usually do a dish like this.  I now live in the North Hills, but honestly, I would totally consider driving down into Shadyside just to get this again.    My friend also said she loved her ravioli.  She said she doesn't normally go meat-less but she was very pleased with her selection.    I'm so glad I finally made it to Girasole, and now am kind of sad I didn't make it a higher priority.  I'll definitely be returning, hopefully sooner than later.",

The atmosphere is inherently romantic, except that the popularity of the restaurant combined with the small space makes it difficult for it to be an intimate outing on a weekend (I've been there on Friday and Sunday evenings for dinner, not sure the situation on weekdays). Sometimes it can get pretty loud.  However, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine.  I've tried three entrees:  1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pasta  2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for me  3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had. Dipped the bread in the extra sauce, this will definitely be my order moving forward!",

Found this neighborhood gem which became increasingly and surprisingly crowded for so early (5:00ish) on a Sunday. We got a table outside since it was so beautiful out and had a drink which was nice (their selection was better than the standard I expected but didn't venture into craft cocktail territory) and started with the antipasto which was a nice selection of meats and vegetables. I had the risotto which was terrific and my husband had the gnocchi which he said was good. Service was attentive and our questions about ingredients due to food allergies were answered expertly.  Overall I think Girasole is a great find in a neighborhood that seems to have more than enough bars serving boring bar food. Go to Girasole where the locals who love nicely prepared Italian food go and become a regular who appears to get treated like family.",

Like elbowing the table next to you tiny. But still so much charm! I guess they loosely take your reservation, so don't expect to be seated the minute you arrive. As expected, the place draws quite the crowd of people, we couldn't believe the swarm when we showed up. How awesome! Means they do it right. We went in the summer time and luckily got seated outside on the sidewalk, which was definitely the largest area with the most privacy. Our waitress was super kind, happily talked through my vegan options. Said the kitchen would be happy to make a pasta primavera and she mentioned they had tons of amazing fresh vegetable. She was sure to ask what they should omit, if anything. The side salad was amazing, too. Very fresh salad with tons of fixins, tomatoes, onions, chickpeas, and blue cheese as well. Bread was also provided. Even though they now have a full bar menu, they still allow for BYOB, believe its $8 a person. The owner (older gentlemen) was super sweet in his full suit, sipping his vino and checking on the tables. Happy I finally got here to try it!",

Waitstaff is fine as are the portion sized.  But what's not to like? Well, at Girasole reservations for 6:30 does not mean that you will get seated at about 6:30-6:45, but rather you will likely get seated sometime that evening, which could 1-2 hours later. While waiting for your 'reservations' we saw several group with 'reservations' being turned away because they were too booked. This appears to be the norm here and the owner can get quite testy if called on it. The noise level is a bit much as well and I would not want the table near the main entrance.",

It consisted pieces of spicy sausage mixed in a tomato based broth with chick peas and spinach (I think). We added some shredded parmigiana cheese on top and wow....  My main course was homemade orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. It was very tasty but not overpowering.   You will need to review the menu before you go as they do have a limited selection and the menu rotates seasonally.  The place is small and was packed so the service suffered a bit.

The food was decent but the taste was not anything to drive me back.  Our waitress was really friendly and helpful with choosing items off of the menu.  She was probably the best part of our experience.  I ordered the Gnocchi and it wasn't bad but it didn't really knock my socks off; I felt like I could have made the same dish at home with store sauce.  We also ordered a Burrata appetizer which was pretty good.  My boyfriend ordered the Linguine with clams and had the same \"average\" experience.  The taste of the food was like something I'd order at a pizza shop, for half the price.  I think it's a good early-stages of dating place because the lights are dim and it gives off a romantic vibe.  The food being a pretty basic taste level would also ensure that each partner is at least satisfied.  I could easily see it being overcrowded because it is a small space.  We went on a Thursday night at 8 and didn't have problems getting a seat.  I tried Girasole and scratched it off my list, but I don't really think I would come back.",

The Eatery is almost in a basement type setting, so you really get that classic Italy vibe. The food was good- but it did not blow me off my feet. One complaint, which can be easily fixed, is that the pasta was slightly overcooked in the Linguini with Clam sauce. This is an easy fix- and understandable considering the pasta seemed homemade. Could probably use more flavor too. I also ordered the Polpette, a dish with meatballs and vegetables; but it was kind of advertised as a pasta dish. I was slightly confused when the pasta was MIA, but I was pleased with the high-quality taste. Moral of the story- Stay away from the Linguini and Clams, and don't order the Polpette if you want pasta.   All in all, I think Girasole is a great place that deserves a try. It has a great ambiance, in a cool area of Pitt, and has good food. Check this place out!",

(We were one of the only tables)   We started off with some wine that our waitress suggested. She was attentive but not overwhelming throughout the entire meal. We all started with soup or salads that came with the meals and were both delicious. Then for the main dish, while it wasn't a huge menu, it was a hard decision. I ended up with the Linguine Rustic and couldn't get enough! It was so fresh and enjoyable. Everyone seemed to love what they got so you can't go wrong here.    We finished with a slice of cheesecake and lemon cake and what a way to finish. They were both heavenly! This place is a great atmosphere and even better food! We will be back in the near future but it is small so we will probably come at an off time again.",

    "text": "Have been coming here for years - Girasole remains one of my very favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. It is a very intimate spot - given its limited capacity, it gets packed quickly on weekend evenings. They do take reservations, but you may still need to wait. But they'll call your cell phone when the table is ready.   Have a bar, but also allow BYOB ($7 corkage fee).   The food is always extraordinary. While I've never had a bad meal here, I make a point to go in the fall just to get their pumpkin ravioli, which I fell in love with some years ago. Pro tip: if you ask, they will make it the a sage cream sauce, which in my opinion is superior to the brown butter sauce it normally comes with.   One final note - a few reviews remark on the apparent rudeness of the co-owner/host/maitre'd, Jimmy \"Pie\" Gerasole. I suppose everyone has bad nights, but I have a difficult time imagining Pie being rude to customers. In fact, he's another reason we keep coming back - we've always found him warm, friendly, charming, and funny - and a wonderful part of the Girasole experience.",

However; one problem this causes: there's no sort of dress code, and apparently we live in a society where dudebros think it's acceptable to go out to a nice restaurant wearing a tanktop. I don't care if you're trying to show off the guns, take that crap to Mario's, this is a nice restaurant and I'm not trying to smell your tanning oil and pits.   Wouldn't be a problem if people had a basic level of decency, but gentlemen should be refused service if they lack sleeves or closed toe shoes. Keep your pits and feet away from the rest of us trying to enjoy a nice Italian meal.",

After seeing pictures of Girasole we decided to try it. First off, the surrounding little strip of shops is adorable & perfect to walk around in before or after you dine. As we came upon the restaurant I instantly loved it! It's very similar to reading in NYC when the restaurant is in the bottom floor of a brownstone. We went inside & it's perfectly cozy & smells amazing! The owner is either walking around making sure all is running smooth & above is happy or sitting at a table by the door to greet everyone coming in or on their way out. I can't exactly remember what we had to eat at our first experience here, but I do remember it was delicious! We couldn't wait to come back. So we came again to see Andrea Bocelli a couple weeks ago & Girasole did NOT disappoint again... we started with the meatball appetizer which was SOOO delicious! Then we got the Mezza Rigatoni which, oh my goodness, was to die for delicious & the steak dish with mushroom risotto & asparagus, again oh my!!  This place will forever be worth the drive from Buffalo... it's probably good we don't like close lol! Keep up the amazing work Girasole, you have the best Italian food around!",

Though the reviews were great and food looked yummy, it wasn't exactly how I pictured it. Wasn't aware that the restaurant was SMALL, but we didn't mind sitting outside on a nice sunny day. The menu consisted of simple list of seasonal items. I ordered the spinach ricotta ravioli while my mother and brother ordered the spaghettini with clams. Bread basket is given to much on and a small salad is served with your meal. Very fresh and clean.  The disappointment started to set in when our food came in. My ravioli only had five pieces and didn't have much filling inside. Can barely taste the spinach. The tomato cream sauce looked old also. The spaghettini my brother and mother ordered looked really good and I wish I could've ordered that instead. They seemed to enjoy it very much.  Italian food is generally expensive, but the quality I was served? Not worth it.",

Bread and butter were immediately put on the table and as soon as a glass of wine made its way to my hand, I was in a happy place.  The atmosphere is fantastic--tons of happy, chatting groups of people. The food was fantastic. I got the ravioli, which appeared to have been made in house (different sized pieces) and served with a delicious, creamy tomato sauce. YUM.

The best part about this salad is the gorgonzola. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. The sunflower vinaigrette is nice and lite, and I never leave feeling gross or overly stuffed. Definitely the best salad on Walnut Street.  For dinner, the polenta is nice. Again, it's lite and you can avoid that icky, bloated feeling at the end of a big, Italian meal. The polenta is baked and then topped with a lite red sauce, escarole, mozzarella, and beans. Great combination. The pumpkin ravioli is nice in the fall-love the brown butter and sage.  Girasole ventures away from the traditional, Pittsburgh Italian cuisine. They are all about fresh, bold flavors. It fills up quickly, so go early for dinner or call and ask for a reservation at this sweet, authentic spot perfectly located on Copeland off of Walnut (right across from Starbucks).",

I had ordered the gnocchi and to this day, I salivate when I think about it. It was thick, saucy, cheesy, seasoned, and delicious. Their wine list is seasonal and equally as delicious! I had tiramisu for dessert and I am usually not a fan because I cant get over the wet-cake texture of it. Girasole's tiramisu was much more massed and dense. If you're into that, I definitely recommend it.   The atmosphere is cozy to put it nicely. Unless you're renting the entire place out for the night, I don't suggest going with a group. It has very NYC bistro feel to it. The owners are amazing - I'm probably bias because they remind me of everyone of my Italian cousins and uncles.   If you can fit it in before this summer flies by even more, try and sit outside and enjoy the weather. You almost forget you're in a city full of sports loving Yinzers and instead are sitting at a side street cafe in Italia!   Don't forget to do a limoncello shot!",

My review is based on an aggregation of numerous different dining experiences at this restaurant, so I feel that it is about as unbiased as a single person's review can be.  The owner is usually on site. He is mostly helpful and professional. He's somewhat impatient.  The food is delicious. Everything from the salad to the entree to the dessert is well prepared and very tasty. Portions are reasonably sized. I don't think you could be disappointed in this category.  On weeknights, the atmosphere is calm and very pleasant. On Friday and Saturday nights things get crazy. There is often a wait and seating is tight. Don't expect much interaction with your server and stay out of the way.  My only beef with Girasole is one that I see at most good restaurants: poor treatment of young people. As a college student, you get a crappy table and a server who can't be bothered with your existence. In contrast, families and older couples get excellent service.  I would highly recommend Girasole for small family gatherings and special nights. Students may wish to save their money, as may those looking for a relaxing evening.",

    "text": "Having lived a short three blocks away from Girasole, this is the perfect date night place! It's BYOB ($7/person charge) and is romantically quaint, hidden gem of Walnut Street. I have ate here on a number of occasions - whether its been on a date, with family, with girlfriends, or picking up takeout - Girasole ALWAYS delivers. I have yet to come across Italian that beats it in Pittsburgh. The Spinach Ravioli is my go-to. The salad to start with sunflower dressing and garbanzo beans is amazing.   I've tried quite a few 'fish specials' as well. Always worth the shot.   Not interested in BYOB? Girasole's Pinot Grigio is always nice.",

    "text": "Girasole is a cute little Italian restaurant in the heart of Shadyside. The service staff is friendly and professional. The owner is typically around and often serves as the maitre d.   The food here is consistently good. Almost immediately after you sit down, you're welcomed to fresh Italian bread, which you can enjoy with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.   The menu is literally seasonal (there is one set menu for each of the four seasons of the year) and I haven't observed many changes over the years.  All the main courses come with a simple but delightful salad, which basically consists of garden greens, Gorgonzola cheese, sunflower seeds and a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette.   The potato gnocchi are excellent and the spinach and ricotta raviolis are also wonderful.  All in all, Girasole is a pretty good restaurant - and the only improvement I can suggest is that their bread would be so much more enjoyable if they warmed their butter so it is spreadable.",

I was promptly met by the owner who immediately stopped what he was doing to seat me, which was nice because the place was crowded.  No problem.  I was happy.  I ordered the fish of the day, which was walleye on a portion of tomato risotto with greens.  The fish was super fresh and delicious; the risotto was nicely prepared and also delicious.  But the greens were bitter and overpowered the whole thing.  If it weren't for that, I would have given Girasole four or possibly five stars.  It kinda ruined the experience.  With two chiantis and tip, the bill came out to $54.  Having said all of that, I'm going to give it another try.  The gnocchi looked interesting as did several of the other pastas.  Maybe next trip.",

Finally got around to it tonight as we were looking for a nice patio dining experience on what is presumably one of the last warm autumn evenings of the year. The patio is somewhat tight, but pleasant -- we were able to get seated within a few minutes. It's on a side street to Walnut, so it's quiet and appears to be non-smoking which is a huge plus.  The entrees (pumpkin ravioli and grilled chicken with gnocchi) were delicious, as were the appetizer salads. They have a decent Italian wine menu, and a selection of mixed drinks too. Overall, we had a good experience, although the servers seemed rushed and this made the experience somewhat less pleasant.",

    "text": "THE SHORT VERSION: You must eat here! The Pumpkin Ravioli was the best thing I've EVER put in my mouth. Homemade spinach ravioli stuffed with pumpkin smothered in brown butter, walnuts and pancetta is to die for. Sweet meets salty goodness! Creamy pumpkin--yum! And this is coming from someone who HATES pumpkin.   THE LONG VERSION: First, the regulars know you don't need a reservation. I would call ahead and see what time to come but if you don't want to wait long come before 5 or after 8. I think the guy walking around with a glass of wine is the owner and he could give a shit if you have a reservation. He may even take waiting customers out of order. But it really is worth the wait.   Second, the atmosphere is tight. Don't bring more than four people. Lots of two topper tables make it for a cozy romantic evening. Just be prepared to knock elbows with the neighboring tables. It was a nice October evening when we came so we were able to eat outside which is much better for those of us who don't like all the coziness and noise :-)  Third, the food!!! From the appetizer of antipasti to the cheesecake dessert --- this was the best experience my mouth has had in a long time. I read the reviews about the house salad but wasn't prepared. This is not your typical spring mix with tomatoes and Italian dressing. Be prepared for Gorgonzola cheese, sunflower seeds, Kalamata olives and more. The only thing they could improved upon, and this is minor, is to have a few olive oil choices and to warm the bread. I had the risotto with smoked mozzarella with hot Italian sausage, peppers and onions. Creamy, smokey flavors were finished off with the heat from the sausage. Super yummy! My husband was the one who ordered the pumpkin goodness! We finished off the dinner with cheesecake and cherries (because they were out of most of their homemade dessert by 9:30 when we ate). The cheesecake was yummy but the drunken cherries on top where a sweet surprise to finish up the dinner.",

Perfect little house salad, ideally dressed. The linguine clams was celestial. Al dente pasta, sweet clams, enough buttery clam sauce to finish off all of the excellent bread. Food: 5 stars.   A few rain drops on our heads (sitting outside) until the very attentive host moved us over to a cozy table under roof. Great spot to enjoy a world class tiramisu and a scoop of deep dark chocolate gelato. Ambiance: 5 stars.   Food and ambiance - what else is there? There's Gwen. If you Google \"Waitperson, professional grade\" there'll be a video of this lovely gracious young woman being herself. Warm, welcoming, knowledgable, timely, delightful. She made a splendid meal experience simply perfect.   To quote the Terminator: We'll be back.",

The ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade. The only issue I have with the place is the owner. He is in charge of seating people and barked at us that there were no tables. We sat outside under the heater and enjoyed our meal there. He definitely put enough of a damper on the vibe of the place that I won't be returning. It simply isn't worth it.",

It's a tiny place and seating in the winter is limited so we understood. We went to a nearby bar to grab drinks while waiting for our reservation.  After 45 past our reservation, we hadn't heard anything from Girasole sp called to inquire.  The owner yelled at us for calling and said they are a tiny restaurant and would let US know when THEY were ready for us. Very off putting.   We finally got seated around 1.5 hours past our original reservation time.    The place was tiny but the service was great (only reason for the 3 star rating). Might be a better place for a smaller party but it was a mistake trying to book for a group larger than 4.  Food was good, but not the best Italian I've ever had. Large portions and a great wine selection. Price per person in our large party for an entre, glass of wine and gratuity came to $40.",

Both were ok, the Linguine seemed a little bland to me and some of the clams seemed like they were from a can? The rigatoni was much better.  The pasta was cooked well and the meat sauce was very flavorful.  I was wishing for red pepper flakes the whole time though, but that's a personal preference really.

I called just to simply see if they were open on Christmas Eve. A man answered the phone and when I asked if they would be open his response was, \"No, we are a very, very holy family. Holy holy family.\" THEN HANGS UP ON ME. Needless to say, we will NEVER dine at Girasole again. So extremely rude. Cannot justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner.",

The quaint, semi-hidden spot right off of Walnut Street accompanied by its warm and inviting atmosphere make it an excellent people pleaser. The menu is fairly small and changes seasonally to assure fresh and delicious ingredients. The wine list is extensive and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli is usually featured and always delicious. Another plus is that it's open for lunch as well and offers a slightly cheaper selection. Regardless, though, it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food and experience. The only downside is that the venue itself is tiny and it would definitely be difficult to accommodate a larger party.   One of my favorite things about Girasole is that the owner is also often the host! He has such a bold personality and really makes the whole atmosphere more homey and authentic feeling. To add to this mood, there is often live music in the restaurant--usually just a single violin or guitar player. My favorite experience at Girasole was one late summer night when it was beginning to cool down and I took some friends of mine from Cleveland to have dinner there. I knew they would enjoy Girasole but the wait was long so we wound up sitting outside on the patio even though it was a little cold. A man with a guitar went around the restaurant singing beautiful songs to each table and eventually made it outside. Since we were the only table outside we took our request and sang the best rendition of Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" I've ever heard!   Girasole is a wonderful treat amongst Pittsburgh's restaurant scene and never fails to deliver a delicious meal and a wonderful dining experience!",

Would recommend as a place to eat, as the food is quite satisfactory, but maybe not if you were looking for a quieter, more ambient place to dine, as the restaurant can get quite boisterous.",

Our server was professional and polished. She was super pleasant and met all of our needs.   We started off with the mussels and lamb meatballs. Moved on to a few entrees; duck with blueberry compote over polenta, ravioli in a creamy marinara, and tortellini in a creamy sauce with pancetta. Ended the evening with the coconut cake. Everything was absolutely delicious.   10/10 will be back many more times.",

Upon arriving at Girasole's, it was PACKED, but we didn't have to wait too long before the proprietor found us a table. In the meantime, Pittsburgh natives chatted with us and suggested popular dishes (the consensus is that everything is delicious).   We got the Bruschetta to start - omg to die for, so delicious - bursting with ripe tomatoes and the perfect blend of herbs and cheese!  My date got the squid ink linguine, and I got the ravioli. The pasta was fresh and so tasty, not to mention piping hot!   We had great wine pairings based on the suggestion of our server, and the proprietor and a friend sang while playing the guitar (while sporting a glass of red wine in hand).   It felt very authentic Italian, and cozy. If I lived in Pitt, I would be back all the time!",

An older gentleman greeted us, which I assumed was the manager. He asked if we had a reservation, and we didn't.   He seemed to glance up and down at us, noticing that we either looked like students or weren't well dressed, and shooed us out of the restaurant saying that they were full. We were so confused because we wouldn't have minded waiting, but he didn't even give us the option to put our names down on the waitlist.   Then, a few minutes later as we were about to turn the block, he came running out the door saying they had one last table for us to eat. Super confusing and rude service, and not sure I would come back again if I'm going to be judged for my appearance before dining here.",

It was overly crisp- couldn't break off or cut the pieces. The entrees were less than acceptable. My clams in a white sauce were tasteless- and there were only 8 clams (they also forgot to provide a bowl for the shells). My daughter's ravs were bland and tough (not al-dente...just undercooked). The place is small and loud and the VERY LOUD music was so overpowering that no one could hear each other speak!  After the so so dinner we opted to leave before dessert- wanted to get out of the noise! The only positive I can say is our server was pleasant and attentive.",

Then, we asked for the soup of the day (chick peas, mushroom and sausage) and chicken noodle was brought out to us. We asked for more bread after our meals were served and never got it.

We made a reservation the day prior and were seated at 7 with no wait (they will not sit you until your entire party arrives). The space is small & intimate & there are tables in unique spots (we ended up sitting back near the kitchen). I frankly liked this the most, it felt like the most spacious area of the place. Our server, as busy as he was, was extremely attentive and informative on menu items. I am a picky eater with some dietary restrictions & I was really happy with how accommodating this restaurant was with menu swaps, without me getting into detail. My entire family ended up ordering the same thing - the rigatoni with meat sauce & I ordered the linguine with marinara & shrimp. Our meals were accompanied by salads also.  The food was delicious, I think my noodles were made in house & were cooked perfectly, the sauce was great, and the shrimp was prepared perfect- not over cooked in the slightest. My family all seemed to agree that the ravioli was some of the best that they had ever had.   I can truly say Girasole is one the best Italian spots in Pittsburgh. A restaurant that is constantly packed , even the weekend after New Years must be doing something right. It definitely has stood the test of time.",

While some might feel congested, I liked the homey feel and the food only further added to that comforting, homey experience. Because the space is so small, I highly recommend making reservations in advance. I've heard reservations aren't always honored here, but I think it's always worth a shot.   The menu is short and simple and it changes based on the season. I visited Girasole in January and every dish my table ordered was delicious and oh so comforting, perfect for the bitter cold temperature outside that evening. Of the dishes we ordered, the ravioli in tomato cream sauce was the table's favorite. The salad that comes with the meal was also quite nice and far more than just lettuce and dressing. Also, save room for dessert! We ordered tiramisu and panna cotta and both were out of this world!  Girasole is definitely a win in my book for great Italian. I plan to visit once per season to get a taste of each of their menus!",

Although we had reservations for 7 pm, we had to wait over thirty minutes for our \"reserved table.\" They need to have a better understanding of how to hold tables or just don't take reservations. The restaurant was very crowded and there was no room to wait. It was just a disorganized, chaotic mess. My party ended up going to Starbucks across the street to wait, while we left one person in the restaurant.   The food was fine nothing extraordinary. The bread was not warm. The house salad was normal. I had the cocoa fettuccine with gorgonzola, pistachio, and cauliflower. The dish was good, but a bit oily for my liking. They were out of tiramisu for dessert, which was disappointing. I got the pistachio cheesecake, which was ok. Overall, I will not be back as the service for getting seated was terrible. They need to learn proper manners when dealing with guests who have reservations.",

As for the wine pairing, I believe I got the PINOT GRIGIO, or whichever was the second choice on their whites that was recommended for the dish I ordered. The linguine rustic was tasty and a huge portion size, but quite salty. The wine pairing was delicious though and complimented it very well. I should have tried the SQUID INK LINGUINE instead, or the GNOCCHI that other yelpers are seemingly raving about.  Anyway, I really liked the decor and feel of Girasole. The price point is pretty high, so expect to spend at least $20 here. Additionally, the noise level of the restaurant was waaay too loud for me that I could hardly have a conversation, I guess that at least says other people like to come here.  I hope I can give Girasole another chance..",

The most recent visit was more so on the disappointing side than anything. It was a busy Saturday night, we had a reservation for 5 which I made a week prior. We ended up getting stuck right on the corner where the kitchen meets the hallway, with an extra chair shoved on the end of the table. The hostess practically flung the menus at us and additionally, our hors d'oeuvres plates. In the past, I always left here feeling satisfied from start to finish...but this last visit left a poor taste in my mouth (thankfully, not literally). I'll most likely come back, but I think the staff could use a little fine tuning on the customer service skills.",

It is BYOB so feel free to bring your favorite bottle to enjoy with your meal.  They have a rotating seasonal menu that offers daily chicken, fish and meat specials.  Each meal comes with a house salad and a side of bread.   The restaurant is great at accommodating your dietary needs. I came with my family for my graduation and they were able to accommodate my mom who has Celiac (an allergy to gluten) without any problems!     I have to admit, if you come here it's definitely for the food. The restaurant is small (which creates a romantic setting) and the tables are very close together (which helps you make friends with your neighbors)! The servers do a great job of tending to their guests and making the best of the situation and the restaurant can feel cramped, loud and chaotic if you are not ready for it.  You are definitely better off making a reservation, but keep in mind that t doesn't always guarantee that your table will be available at that specified time.   I recommend going to Girasole on your next date night with an open mind and taking the time to enjoy the food and atmosphere, since that is what makes Girasole one of the best restaurants in Shadyside!",

The atmosphere was quaint but the noise was so loud. We had to continually ask one another to repeat themselves.   The meal itself was nice but nothing outstanding. Each meal comes with complementary bread and a side salad. A plus is that the menu is quite seasonal. I had the roast chicken with brioche stuffing, brussel spouts and pumpkin whipped mashed potato and my friend had the scallops with chorizo, farro, shrimp and a pea puree. The later was 1/3 the sized of mine. Portion sizing here is definitely not their strong suit. I highly advise asking about this before order, especially for men!  Service-wise the waiter was attentive and helpful. However, I was a little thrown back to observe the waitresses placing the complimentary bread into the basket with her bare hands... I was not impressed. Are a pair of tongs really that difficult to find in a restaurant??  Overall, Girasole is a nice place but over priced and very noisy.",

We made reservations ahead of time for dinner on a Saturday night. Upon arrival at the designated time, we were informed there were two people ahead of us. They wrote down our phone number and told us to go get a drink somewhere else, and they would call us when our table was ready. It was a little chilly, and being pregnant I could not \"get a drink\", so we window shopped and walked around for about 30 minutes.  We were both so hungry we debated about how long to wait or if we should just find another place. We found another place. And it's a good thing, because we never received a phone call from Girasole telling us our table was ready.   I was very disappointed because I had heard good things about this restaurant and was really looking forward to my meal there.",

    "text": "While Girasole serves delicious and authentic italian food, it is not for the faint of heart! The owner here can be very intimidating and if you're here during peak hours like Friday or Saturday night without a reservation? Forget about it.  The owner is the one who seats guests, but from what I observed, he doesn't have a very official seating system. I wasn't very confident that he was truly seating guests without reservations in the order in which they arrived. I understand that certain party sizes will be seated before others, regardless of arrival time, but even still, it didn't seem very legit. They'd benefit greatly from an experienced hostess. We had a reservation and were seated 45 minutes after our time. There was a group of 5 that arrived without a reservation a few minutes after we arrived and they were still waiting for a table after we finished eating and left nearly 2 hours later. God bless their patience!  The restaurant is very small and they cram as many tables and seats into this place as possible, making it very difficult to get around everybody to get to your table and exit. You cant get in and out of this place without at least a half dozen excuse me's. I know that more tables = more money, but they could definitely stand to remove a few tables to improve the comfort of their customers. But maybe this kind of atmosphere is their goal? A loud restaurant with close seating...very family like. Either way, I'm not sure it's for me.  The food here is very good and worth returning for. I had a garlic sauce pasta that was cooked to perfection. My husband had pasta with meat sauce that he said he really enjoyed. My friend and I shared a chocolate cake that was rich, moist and perfectly sweet.  In the summer, this place is likely more tolerable as they have outdoor seating, so I might give it a try again come summer. But as for winter, if you want a place where you can have a conversation, good luck being heard over all the noise. If you like your personal space when dining, this joint is not for you! If those things don't bother you, enjoy!",

The menu is diverse yet not too huge to be confusing. We tried the salad and soup that came with the entree (love that!). We liked them both. For main course, I had the Italian cheese omelet and my husband got the polenta. I liked my cheese omelet, it came well shaped and the balance of the three cheeses were good, although I would prefer less of the blue cheese. My husband enjoyed his polenta as well (in general I am not a fan of polenta's texture).   Would definitely return to try pastas and other items on the menu.",

The restaurant is so small that you're literally bumping elbows with the next table while attempting to eat, it was uncomfortably cold as they sat us at a table right by the door, which was constantly opening as there is no waiting room so we were hit with bursts of cold air every 5 minutes. Not to the mention the noise does not make for a pleasant relaxing ambiance. Our server was extremely snooty and acted put out that we were even there. There were no water glasses on the table and he never offered or even served us water, the bread basket for four people was extremely meager and we asked twice for a second basket which he took a half hour to bring, my friend had no fork in her place setting which it took five 5 minutes after asking the server to bring one while her hot meal sat waiting. The server offered no suggestions on the menu and when finished he simply threw the check on the table without even saying saying thank you. As far as the food, the meatball appetizer was not even great, Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza meatballs and Ricotta's blows Girasoles away, I don't understand why everyone loves this place. Honestly Olive Garden is better HA! We will never go back!",

    "text": "What a production! I don't even know where to start...  The place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time, Saturday at 7pm.  The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait.  I did appreciate that tip from her.    Sure enough, we showed up and it's PACKED!  The unfortunate thing is it was cold, so eating on their patio was not going to happen.  Therefor, people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front.  But when I say tiny, I really mean no space at all.  An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation.  Thank God we did, I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain't got reservations.    So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst, because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food.  Of course we ended up with that table!  Thankfully, our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable.    We started with the mussels app.  It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels.  I'd say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce.  The bread actually became my best companion that night... more on that later!  I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese.  I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner.  I LOVE SAUCE!  I know some people aren't into that, so I'll warn you if you like light sauce, you WON'T be happy.  After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week (I know, I'm on an Italian kick!) it didn't hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato.  The sauce though, delicious!    Much to my husbands chagrin, I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate!  He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which I didn't have have a bite of... but the SAUCE.... oh my!  Orgasmic!  I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing!  I kept dipping my bread into his sauce, with him increasingly getting annoyed.  Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce... maybe!!  It was soooo good!    But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal.  I had noticed the older dude/owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time.  I thought that he was pretty rude, but kinda funny, in a typical Italian way.  Well, I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo.  Then the older dude screams \"get outta here you F*%& A@#hole!\" and then shoves him!  Whoa!!    I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee.  Come to find out it's his son.  A woman, who I assume was also part of management (maybe even a family member!), came over to our table and apologized, joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert.  I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated.     I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business.  The good was great, but witnessing that, you wonder how long you can work like that.  Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant!",

    "text": "Most times, I absolutely love a little place with a lot of character...  unfortunately Girasole manages to provide both but not in a good way.  While the dinning room itself has some great traits (stone walls, coppertop tables, etc.), diners more or less are forced to eat almost on top of one another.  As with most small joints, Girasole has the stereotypical quirky owner that is completely passionate about their business, unfortunately in this case, the owner slugged down 3-4 glasses of wine in what seemed to be an hour...  shouting up the stairs outside at patrons and ushering them around like cattle.  Relative to the food, I was super excited for a seasonal menu.  Going against my biggest desires to get the risotto, I decided on the spring chicken dish (hoping for some lighter fare as well).  Ravioli, chicken breast, sauteed greens and a seasoned broth.  While attractive looking, the ravioli seemed like they came from a frozen bag, the chicken breast was dry and the broth was bland.  While the greens were decent, there were barely enough for a few bites.  Maybe everyone else sees something I don't, because this place seems to be constantly packed.",

    "text": "Girasole, an Italian eatery tucked in a side street off of Walnut in Shadyside, offers up some decadent and authentic dishes to the Pittsburgh area. The inside made me feel like I was in the downstairs of an old rustic house in a small Italian town. The menu is on the smaller side, but that did not make choosing our food easy because everything sounded so good.  We landed on the squid ink linguine with lobster and the \"carne\" dish, which was a filet.   Squid Ink Linguine- 3.8/5 I always wanted to try this dish and what better opportunity? The linguine was cooked fine and it was dressed in a cream sauce, topped with plenty of lobster. The taste was mild, with most of the flavor coming from the lobster. I wish the noddles absorbed more of the cream sauce before serving, and the lobster was dry and tough, but as a whole the dish was good.  Filet- 4.4/5 This was a good choice. I was SHOCKED to see three(!) filets come out on this plate. I must not have noticed on the menu, but this also came in a white cream sauce. I was skeptical at first but i must say, it brought the dish together with the roasted fingerling potatoes and rapini and I found myself soaking up the sauce with every bite! Very tender (ordered it rare), it was worth penny ($40).   Some tips: it is BYOB but they charge a $7 fee per person. This is the same fee whether you bring one beer, a bottle of wine, or liquor, otherwise they have a full service bar. There are really nice tables outside on the patio that i wish we requested. They can get pretty busy so give yourself some time (i could hear them yelling in the back that they were falling behind, it could have been just the day we went. glad to hear they were aware and working to fix it though!). This is a great spot for a celebration dinner or special occasion, we'll be back for some great Italian grub!",

    "text": "How have I not been here before?!?!   We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals and went home stuffed (with leftovers too).     Food - I started with the soup of the day - a tomato and tiny meatball concoction that was well balanced and hearty.   Then on the entree - a filet mignon crusted with cocoa nibs and a cocoa nib pasta with a cream sauce and broccoli.  The steak was perfectly cooked and the cream sauce was a nice compliment.  I couldn't really identify the cocoa nib in either the steak or the pasta, but they were both delicious.   Dessert was a blood orange panna cotta.  Perfect texture and just the right amount of sweetness to end the meal.  Overall a winner.  A mention also needs to go to the chicken and polenta dish that one of my companions ordered.  I almost never order chicken in a restaurant because I can't stand to pay for a dry piece of chicken.  This chicken, though, was succulent and flavorful. The sauce and polenta melded together for a creamy accompaniment.  This is a chicken dish I'd order.     Service - Excellent service throughout the meal.  The server was prompt and attentive, taking a little extra time with the details.  For example, she noted that the salad contains two love 'em or hate 'em ingredients (red onions and gorgonzola) and made sure each person actually wanted them.    Atmosphere - This would be a great date night spot.  It's a small and a little crowded basement space, but it's got a really nice feel to it.    Overall, I loved it and I'll be back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Girasole from all the hype and the fact it is literally always busy! Maybe that's why I felt only 3 stars about it... I set the bar too high before going!  We went to Girasole on a Friday evening. Granted, we didn't have reservations, but we were a party of 4 and it was somewhat late by the time we got there (about 8 pm). We asked how long the wait was fully expecting it to be too long & we would have to give up, but they told us only a couple minutes while they waited for a table to get up. It ended up taking about 30 minutes and multiple walk-ins came after us and were seated. Again, we didn't have reservations so we expected to wait, but we were told a couple minutes that ended up being 30.  They sat us back by the kitchen. I'm not normally picky about this, but the kitchen at Girasole is LOUD. Lots of plates slamming, and even had a wine glass broken with glass shattering all around our feet and backs. Also, we were weirdly seated under the AC, which kept dripping on our shoulders. It honestly felt like they shouldn't have even had a table there but tried to cram one more in.  Outside of the wait and table placement, our server was very polite. They seemed stretched very thin, though. It was hard to get her to come back to the table. Granted, she took care of everything when she did come by, it was just infrequent. The food was good, but expensive for what you got. Basic, albeit very tasty, pasta dishes priced as though they were complex or included expensive ingredients.   It's unlikely I will return to Girasole again. I'm sure we ended up with the perfect storm of things to disrupt our experience, but there's just too many other great Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh I'd rather spend money (and calories) on.",

    "text": "Very good. Food and service are excellent. We had the antipasto plate and It was soooo good. I got the meatball dish and the meatballs were so soft and good! Flavor was amazing! My boyfriend got the gnocchi and It was delicious as well. Admittedly I've had better gnocchi but the sauce It was in made up for it. Their sauces were incredible. The only thing about this place you need to know is that IT IS SMALL. And I mean small small. If you sit inside and It gets busy just know you'll be sitting back to back or right next to someone so much you have to shift chairs and tables around just to leave. I get that it's a small face but didn't really enjoy having an older couple give me and my boyfriend dirty looks while we were on our anniversary date. Otherwise it's great food, the owner is very nice and walks around, and service is quick. I'd definitely come here again but sit outside or at an off time!",

The space is small and intimate, and it always brings me back to my travels to Italy. The service even makes you feel like you're in Italy (if you know, you know). At peak dinner hours, it can be a challenge to get a table but it's well worth the wait. In the summer I really enjoy sitting outside on the sidewalk tables and people watching while sipping a glass of wine.   My go-to is the potato gnocchi, but the linguine rustic is a very close second. All entrees are served with either a cup of soup or a salad. Their house salad is phenomenal; topped with sunflower seeds, Gorgonzola, red onions, and sunflower dressing.",

The recommended coming later in the night so we arrived at 8:00 and were seated right away. The restaurant is small so be prattled to wait if you do have a larger party and want to visit around 7 or 7:30.   We started with the mushroom bruschetta. Great dish to share. Each entree comes with soup or salad. The dinner salad is really large and flavorful. For dinner I had the spinach ricotta ravioli - delicious! The only downside is the portion is small, but the with the mushroom bruschetta it was enough.   This well worth making the trip to Shadyside. The food is delicious and the intimate atmosphere makes for the perfect date night.",

The rich tomato cream sauce is so tasty that I wish the portion size was slightly larger so that I could make the meal last longer. The pasta entrees come with either a soup or salad on the side--and I highly recommend the fresh house salad!   My only qualms with the dining experience are with the size of the restaurant. It is quite cozy so probably not the best option for large parties as seating is limited. Also, while I've never had problems with my dinner reservations, I know of several people who had to wait outside for long periods of time despite having a reservation.",

The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. We came for lunch.  Drinks: cocktails available and a large wine selection. I enjoyed a cappuccino which was delicious.  Food: they give you complimentary bread and have oil and balsamic on the table which was sooo good, I felt like a glutton piling this into my mouth.  We got Caesar salads which were good, they had walnuts instead of croutons which were really good, also had white sardines on it for those of you who like the fish (i am sure you can ask for it without the sardines). We ordered the clam pasta which was just okay, a little bland and missing something but we couldn't put our finger on it, i would pass on this. My dad got the chicken Marsala with prosciutto and this was insane! Probably the best chicken i have ever eaten out in a restaurant and i hold high standards for this type of dish. Hands down incredible and recommend.",

    "text": "Went out of our way to go to this wonderful restaurant as we found out so did many other patrons. First of let me say if you are going don't go unless you got a reservation. Reservations are very loose. We got there just before our 6 and still had to wait. Although I will say it was faster than I thought about 10-15min. Dinner took about 1:15-1:30. Which is why he tells walk ups 1:30 and will tell you these people all called for reservations. The owner was your typical older Italian guy.(In his 80s- Fabulous he still takes an interest and serves as a host. I can see how his attitude can rub people the wrong way but he is just trying to be honest which some take as rude) lucky for us it was a nice evening and we were seated on the patio. He does ask those checking in to go up on the sidewalk where he can see you. That is for the comfort of those eating on the patio and the servers trying to serve them. I wish some people would have realized this. It does not take all 4-6 of you to stand down there to check in. Think about how you would feel if you were one of those patrons on the patio. It is a small place but can easily hold 50 people inside and another 15 .outside. Those that listen to his directions are quickly seated. Onto food. Husband enjoyed a beer. They ran out of tall drinking glasses so I got a small warm water with lemon. Later brought us the tall glasses with Ice.Bruschetta for appetizer-very tasty House Salad could have used more dressing on it. Had to ask for our basket of bread. Husband had Gnocchi-very tasty and large serving. I explored and had the squid linguini with a light cream sauce and lobster( plenty of it) . So glad I tried it. It was very good and lady table next to us had it too and also was happy with it. The little boy behind us had mussels and said he loved them. We had tiramisu for dessert and Americano and Cappuccino. We shared the tiramisu and it was plenty for both of us. The bathrooms are way in the back you actually walk pass the servers station and kitchen to get to them. We were wondering with the crowd how they manage people when it is cold out. The place is too small to have an indoor waiting area. Would love to see them move into a more customer oriented space. Maybe they can find one in the North Hills.Wink Wink. We will look forward to going back in the future. Saw a friend there who says they been going there for 2 years and everything they have ate taste great.",

The owner is there every time I'm there which to me, symbolizes the hospitality, down to earth, and homey feel. It's cozy, pretty casual, and normally busy. I highly recommend a reservation! They don't do real reservations, so there is still a chance of a wait; however, it puts you near the head of the line. They offer outdoor seating which is nice when the weather is warmer. Oh, and BYOB  The food is a good portion, on the larger side (I always take half to go!), and delicious. They change their menu every so often to keep with the season. The prices are on the higher end, but I think it's worth the spend if you're craving good Italian food. This time I opted for the orecchiette (aglio e olio, rapini, and sausage) $18; the sausage was tasty and the sauce (garlic and oil) was light. All their pastas come with a salad or soup. There penne, potato gnocchi, and risotto are popular choices! To finish off, we had the coconut cake which was fluffy and topped with the right amount of coconut and icing. Perfect way to finish off the meal. I look forward to trying one of their special menu items!",

The filling of the ravioli was light yet flavorful but what really tied together the dish was the blush sauce - I wish I could buy jars and jars of this! (Definitely good for dipping with the bread they give you) The gnocchi as well was well-baked and paired well with the fresh mozzarella.   However, I've called and made reservations here multiple times but have still had to wait 20-30 mins so be sure to factor that into your dinner plans. There's lots of stores to walk around nearby if you do find yourself waiting to be seated.",

I understand that it's difficult for a restaurant to know when its guests will be leaving, then proceed to hold a table (after all, it's a busy Saturday night), which potentially takes time and business away from other patrons. Why not eliminate reservations all together, and switch over to a system such as the NoWait app? That way, patrons can \"get in line\" at their earliest convenience, then walk around Walnut Street until their table is ready. Customers won't be upset that their table isn't ready at a set time, nor will they have to stand around waiting in a massive cluster outside the small doorway. It's just a thought. I love your Italian food, the pasta with the seafood cream sauce is to die for :)",

The owner is so courteous and I love how he visits from table to table, having a glass of wine with the guests.  Reminds me of my grandfather's generation of Italian relatives.  I wish I still lived in Pittsburgh, I would be at Girasole on a very regular basis.  Everything is good.",

The food was absolutely amazing - the mushroom bruscetta was out of this world and the polenta was to die for.  It's fairly unusual to find vegetarian Italian food so remarkable.  Service was great, especially for such a small space.  I'd recommend Girasole for special occasions.  It's a cozy little spot.",

While I think $27 is robbery for a small piece of breaded salmon and won't be going back for that reason, it still was a good meal. We also had the rigatoni, which was excellent. The place is very small and has a casual feel that doesn't match the high price. But when in Shady you can throw some SOS out there and folks will line up to lick the plate, LOL. Still, pretty solid. Just can't come back once you know they charge that much for average salmon. Wine was nice, but very small choice...",

I had the special, bucatini all'amatriciana, which was fabulous and you could tell the noodles were homemade! Bruschetta, rose, and fresh table bread were all delicious. Only basic thing was the Penne with chicken, nothing special and could be made at home.  Overall one of our favorite easy Italian places in PGH",

    "text": "Came to Girasole with my girlfriend for our two year anniversary after receiving a recommendation from a friend.   For being located in what is basically a basement, the interior of Girasole is special, due to the fact that it is tastefully adorned with interesting art pieces, plenty of sunflowers, and has the feel of many of the restaurants I enjoyed while studying in Italy.  My date and I enjoyed wine by the glass, a cut of incredibly fresh filet mignon which rested on a flavorful bed of risotto, and cheesecake for dessert.  I forget what night of the week we came, but a gentlemen with an acoustic guitar walked around the restaurant, tastefully serenading tables with an interesting blend of music which ranged from the Beatles to James Taylor to Dean Martin.  I will be dreaming about this meal for quite some time and am almost afraid to come back to Girasole for fear of sullying my incredible first impression.  The only downside to Girasole is that you are packed into the small dining area with many other guests which creates a very noisy environment. Probably not ideal for a first date if you're looking to have conversation, unless you like yelling all night. Fortunately for me, I didn't need to discuss much with my doll and seeing her beautiful face enjoy a great meal and music on our anniversary was more than satisfying for me.",

I think Pittsburgh has absolutely wonderful food, and I truly became entranced with the culinary scene while attending Carnegie Mellon and checking out local fare. Luckily for us CMU kids, Shadyside was a hop, skip, and a jump away. Therefore, it was naturally the perfect neighborhood to dine and shop.  I had the opportunity to attend two group birthday dinners at Girasole. Both times the food was authentic. The place itself is very small and intimate, so it has a very nice, cozy, if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here, the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner, when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave, and said to our group, (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) \"why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service?\" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this, but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible, most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job. That is the prime reason why I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

As the wait approached 40 min I went up to him and asked how many reservations there were and if he had any idea how much longer it would be.  He looked at me, mumbled a sentence with the word \"ridiculous\" and said he didn't know.  I politely told him it wasn't a big deal and said he could remove our name from the list.  As we were leaving he came out the door and said we could sit outside (it was 50 degrees with a chance of rain).  Only reason I'm leaving this review is because my mom was all worked up and felt disrespected.  I just can't support business owners like this.  Go elsewhere.",

We were welcomed at the door and seated at a table in the back. We immediately loved the decor. Our waitress came over and offered us water right away and took our order for any drinks.  She returned in a timely manner with our drinks and took our order. I ordered the Pumpkin Ravioli. My friends each had a pasta dish, one with shrimp, one with meat. We read the Yelp reviews to be nosey. I can see what Judy means about space. It's very tiny. But don't let that our anything else in that review deter you from visiting here! Our food was the perfect temperature and I loved the Pumpkin Ravioli! It was the just the right amount (I believe 5 raviolis, maybe 6).. I'm not sure.. I was hungry and we were literally on time restraints for me to really keep track of details. My friends raved about their pasta dishes. We got our check and it was $62.. three different dishes, one soda. Maybe a tad pricey, but when the company is paying.. the price doesn't seem to bother you. As we left, a gentleman sitting by the door said \"Good night, Thank You\" and was very friendly. My experience was a great one. It really is a cute little find and great options to choose from. I'd say GO! Definitely!",

I made reservations for dinner here 3 weeks in advance for 6:30, which isn't even prime dinner time in the city. Upon arrival at 6:25, I gave my name to the host and was rudely informed that I would need to wait. Thinking he had misunderstood and thought we didn't have reservations, my sister clarified that we had 6:30 reservations and was practically beheaded by the man, barking that we would need to wait because he \"can't kick people out.\" Well maybe you shouldn't have let them sit at a table that should've been reserved for 6:30 and we wouldn't have this problem. We proceeded to wait outside until 7:20, never once did we receive an apology or were we checked on to give us a time estimate as to how long we would be waiting. By 7, other groups who had 7 o'clock reservations had joined the throng of patrons waiting outside for tables despite making reservations. At 7:20, the host finally emerged and shouting unkindly that he would \"take the first party of 5.\" Despite clearly being the first to arrive, another group of 5 was taken and seated before us, at which point we went to The Elbow Room for dinner instead. We were actually treated kindly and respectfully at this restaurant, and I will never attempt to eat and Girasole again. I discourage anyone from going to this restaurant - no restaurant is ever forced to take reservations if they find it too difficult to manage. When you do accept reservations, I expect a table to be reserved for me, not to wait on the street indefinitely for up to or over an hour. That is not too much to ask. In addition, to the host who felt the need to tell \"it's not my fault!\" - it isn't mine either.",

It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\"Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\"...\"Sure, what is it?\".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole.",

    "text": "I have been to Girasole numerous times although this is my first review of the place. My most recent visit was on a Saturday night and we did think ahead and make reservations. This definitely helped limit our wait time for a table. On this particularly beautiful Saturday night Girasole was packed. My party of 4 were seated at an outdoor table. The ladies brought a bottle of their favorite vino and were charged a small per person corking fee. My friend and I enjoy all types and styles of beer and weren't sure what to have when the waiter recommended and Italian import call Baladin. This was truly a tasty beer but we both felt like we had been scammed. It was a $28 bottle of beer. I have had some expensive and tasty beers but never for $28. I wish the server would have said that it was a $28 bottle since it was not listed on their menu. The ladies both had pumpkin ravioli which I tried and it was exceptional. I ordered the polenta entree which was like butter in my mouth. Although I did discover a glass shard in the polenta when I was eating it. I brought this to the attention of the Host immediately. They promptly made me a new dish of polenta and didn't charge me for the dish. They were also very apologetic. I would normally give this restaurant a 4 star rating due to the high quality of the food and normally great service. I was just disappointed with the human factors of this dining experience. I would recommend this place to just about anyone especially for lunch. Hopefully my next visit I won't feel like such a sucker...$28  BOTTLE OF BEER!",

    "text": "Girasole is probably my favorite restaurant in the Walnut St. corridor.  I specifically want to talk about their salad.  I know this charming and cozy Italian restuarnt is not a one trick pony (their various Raviolis being especially exceptional) but their signature Girasole Salad is really something special.  In Italian the word \"Girsole\" means \"Sunflower,\" a flavor that really comes through in this salad.  Not only is the salad sprinkled in sunflowers, the dressing is made of some blend of sunflower oil and vinegar and really makes the salad stand out from its peers.  I have thought this dressing so deliciously tangy and unique, I've bought it from the restaurant in a bottle on more than one occasion.  Served in a generous helping, you can order the salad with chicken or shrimp, which are always tender and succulent.  Red onions and gorgonzola really complete the flavor experience.  Really, it's the number one salad in town.",

We were also seated by the grumpy older Italian guy with the glass of wine as also mentioned by another poster. I found him interesting and humourus. Having a close Italian friend growing up being in the restaurant reminded me of dinners at her house with her big extended family. Everyone talks loud but are all laughing and having a great time. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was awesome. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli and the sauce was to die for. My husband and daughter both penne with marinara sauce, one with sausage and one with chicken. They both loved it. We were served by Vito which I believe is the grumpy old guys son. He was attentive and took good care of us considering how busy he was. We loved the whole feel of the restaurant and would definitely go back again",

After pushing our way to the front of the crowded entrance to inform the host we were here, we found a crowd of people standing there complaining that they haven't seen the host in 10 minutes. The host finally came to the front and I said we had reservations. He asked who else had reservations for two, which no one did except for me and my girlfriend. Without asking for my name we were seated right next to the host's podium where he had to pull out the table so we could fit to sit down. We were practically sitting on the laps of the couple next to us. The waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations. Aside from the poor service and chaos, the food was pretty good. I had the risotto which was a little bland but the sausage and mussels made up for it. Also, I was surprised by the limited number of seafood options. I will give girasole another chance at a less busy time but was not impressed.",

Girasole was, as advertised, a very charming cafe with many things to recommend it.   The food was good, but it lost some points with both of us for quality of service and the limited nature of the menu. Our waiter was attentive--until the entrees were served. Then he disappeared. Not only did he disappear but every other server went deaf. They were not so busy that this was necessary. For the size of the restaurant and the number of servers it should not have taken an additional 20 minutes after we had eaten to have plates cleared.  There was a busboy but he was kind of useless.   My husband had the ravioli and I had polenta, both of which were very nice, and we shared a slice of rum cake that was excellent. My suggestion to anyone going there is to look at the online menu first. What you see there is what they will have, period. If nothing looks good it may be a good night to try another spot.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to going to Girasole for weeks, and finally went with my boyfriend for a special date. However, upon arriving the owner ignored me for a solid five minutes in trying to give my name for a table. As soon as a regular came in, the owner tried to greet him, but the patron very strongly suggested that the owner take my name first. The owner gruffly took my name and number. We went somewhere else to get a drink because it was going to be a 45-minute wait. The restaurant never called us, so we ended up eating elsewhere.   Trying not to let the first experience color our opinion of the restaurant we went back a second time with open minds. This time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway. The drink prep table was so close behind me that I couldn't even sit comfortably. (I wish I had reached around and heavily helped myself to the liquor the way the meal went...) The main portion of the restaurant has ambient lighting and a romantic feel. However, our table was cast in the bright glare of the kitchen pass-through window that was basically at the end of our table. The service staff couldn't fit past our table in order to pick up the food. They kept tripping over one another repeatedly and often were yelling so loudly to one another that we couldn't even have a conversation across the table. We then witnessed a fight between the chef and the owner at which point I literally burst out laughing at the absurdity that we were actually seated there. The owner saw me laughing and made some joke about having the best seat in the restaurant and getting to hear the kitchens' comments. Obviously the \"best seat\" part of his comment was sarcastic, but I don't think he has ever sat at our table to realize how horrible it truly is. He thought I was laughing about the chef's comments... absolutely clueless.    I will absolutely never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. For a restaurant to care that little about its customers to seat them basically within the kitchen says a lot about the owners. It is very clear that getting the highest number of people through the door is more important than their customers. Also to top it off they pretend like your experience has been splendid! They should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table. What a horrible experience!",

    "text": "This place is a nice little retreat, and a great place for gnocchi. It's not my favorite Italian restaurant, but it's up there.  The space is in the basement of a commercial building off Walnut on Copland. (for locals, Jen's Juice bar was above it.) The stone walls and low ceiling feel a bit like a wine cellar (which works) but all the hard surfaces and open kitchen mean it can get very loud (doesn't work so well.) On a busy Friday, don't talk about anything you wouldn't want strangers to hear - they are mere inches away!  I don't order pasta unless it's fussy or unique - most places use dry pasta anyway and usually the items are things I can make at home. That being said, I love gnocchi and it is made fresh here. The difference between the dry stuff in the store and fresh is night and day. My favorite dish - a simple gnocchi w/ marinara and fresh mozzarella - is heaven on earth. Sometimes simple is best.  They have one of the best house salads in town - a wonderful vinegarette dressing on mixed greens, garbanzos, sunflower seeds, and blue cheese. It's a nice touch, but the portions are generous enough that it could be offered a la carte - say $4 for the salad and knock $2 off the entree prices.  Around fall, look for seasonal specials like butternut squash ravioli w/ walnut pesto cream sauce.   If I'm in the mood for beans and greens, gnocchi, or maybe a seasonal dish, I'd go here. The entrees didn't captivate me as much. For Italian entrees, I prefer Piccolo Fiorno. Choose the right dish, and I expect you will be pleased!",

The old Italian guy(owner/manager?) who is obviously drunk had a loud verbal argument with a waiter where they threatened and shoved each other right next to our table. This made everyone extremely uncomfortable! Other reviewers used nice words for the atmosphere, but it is extremely cramped and loud, not the intimate atmosphere others claimed. We got our meals at 8:00, it was good but not great. Not worth the price!  The old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress. Besides the uncomfortable environment he created, he really just got in the way as this place is extremely cramped and hard to walk between tables.  So my friends got desert, and I caved and got tiramisu, it was very soggy like it had been frozen, not good.  So be aware they added an automatic 20% gratuity to the check. The problems were not necessarily the waitress's fault, this place is just poorly run.  I can't over state how uncomfortable of environment it was between the cramped seating and the verbal and physical altercations between manager/owner and employees.

Within seconds, greeted by our waitress, whom it was super patient, kind, warm, friendly. Red Wine and Beer for drinks.  Started with the Pane di Fungo, completely all the right combinations, balance, textures, etc. Wanted to get the spinach and ricotta ravioli, but they were all out for the evening. it did not even matter, ordered the Rigatoni which was cooked absolutely perfect al dente. Also- not over sauced, just the right balance there as well. Salads came before, which were super good with the gorgonzola on top. Timing of everything was perfect too, from drinks, salads, appetizers, dinners, and asking if we wanted dessert.   Next to Dish on South Side, this is my next, new favorite, romantic, intimate, quaint spot in Pittsburgh.   Owner was dining at a table in the front, and wished us Happy New Year as we left. Cannot go wrong with Girasole, doing it up right for Pittsburgh diners who know and appreciate what good True food is.",

Call ahead and put yourself on the priority seating list, if possible! While many people waited in the foyer, we were seated immediately. For reference, it was 6:30pm on a Friday.  There are plenty of vegetarian options, and I settled on the risotto, which is cauliflower-themed this time of year.  Loved it! The texture of the rice was perfect, with mellow-sweet cauliflower and toasted pine nuts. There was a balsamic reduction on top that took it to the next level for me - it's rare to find a meatless risotto that achieves such complexity. The salad and bread that come with every meal were also good.  Instead of wine, we had cocktails - I went with the Nerina as I was feeling adventurous. A high-level craft cocktail worth its price, especially if you like bitter flavors.  Will definitely return for another special occasion!",

Management: Worst ever...took a 7:00 reservation for 3 (on a Sunday) several weeks in advance, then sat us about 7:45 - letting a group that was behind us in line sit 20 minutes sooner, solely because they had one more person (hello? the bill for those 2 Moms + 2 teenagers compared to 3 adults?)   Special dishonorable mention for Maitre d' (or owner?) who was openly dismissive of/hostile to those in line. He made a point of confronting the unwashed, saying he can't kick people out, which I completely understand and support (not the way he did it, but still).  Given that fact, however, he can't then take a bunch of 7:00 reservations when he clearly has no reasonable expectation of having any tables available at that time. We were one of many groups in line, all with a similar experience.   I want to stress this is a cool restaurant, with great food. Just not sure it's worth the hassle. Either TAKE the reservation (and, per Seinfeld ... KEEP the reservation) or just go first come/first served.",

We were surprised to see that get them all right even though we saw him drink periodically while seating people.  Food were great, love the red sauce, we ordered penne with shrimp, linguine with clam sauce, veal meatballs for appetizer.  We loved everything mostly, the linguine was bit too salty for my liking, but it was good because the pasta was fresh.",

When we arrived the place was packed but, I was not worried because I had reservations for 4.  Well, we were not even greeted.  I had to chase down someome to let them know we were there and had a reservation.  They basically ignored me.  Soon after we arrived more people came in that had reservations.  They ignored them as well.  I have no idea why we even stuck it out an hour after our reservation time but we did.  As we were waitng the old man sat some 2 tops before us that did not have reservations.  I said to him why not put two two tops together?  He said, \"ugh we can't do that.\"  I was now livid because we had reservations and this is now 45 min. after our time.  So, then I said we can even split up but, he then proceeded to tell me that he had obligations to the parties of 2!?!?!  They didn't even have reservations!!!!!!!!   Apparently, reservations mean nothing!  Do not offer reservations if you are not going to honor that obligation.  Obviously, we will never go back!  Also,  after I told people about our experience they had a similar one there.  Not quite as bad as ours though.  Apparently, the old man caters to his friends and regulars.  Which is a good thing but, not at the cost of other patrons.",

I asked if they were taking reservations and he said nothing till 10 in a very rude tone. I said ok thank you have a.... And he hung up on me. Won't even bother checking this place out if that's how they treat customers. I will give your neighbors the business because they were not rude to me on the phone.   Update ** my fiance found this on yelp - he knew I had a negative review but ensured me that it probably wouldn't happened again so he called. Same treatment - he was blown away and it is incredibly frustrating when someone hangs up with out any  goodbye or have a nice night. He just. Barked that they had nothing available and hung up. This place really needs to get someone else to answer their phones because I feel like telling everyone to not waste their time on this place.",

The restaurant is small. In the summer, tables are added outside to accomodate more diners. I will say that it was quite crowded on a very cold fall day, and there was no area to wait for our reservation, which was about 15-20 minutes late.

My friend ordered the linguini rustic, and he was disappointed because it was not what the waitress described. She said it was salty but the pasta was bland. The spinach and ricotta ravioli was very good though, and the sauce was flavorful. Each entree came with a soup or salad which were very good. The sausage and mushroom soup was very rich and delicious.   However, our waitress did not warn us about the cork charge. We knew it was BYOB so my friends and I brought a bottle of wine to brunch. She took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything. Online, another reviewer said it was a $7 cork charge which I though was very reasonable. Because of this, I did not ask the waitress what the cork charge was.  However, I learned it was a $7 PER PERSON cork charge when I received the bill, which I think is ridiculous. Most restaurants charge per bottle, not per person. So if I came by myself, it would be a $7 cork charge. I came with 3 friends so the cork charge was $28! If you come with a party of 10, it will be a $70 cork charge!!!  I may or may not come back. If I do, I definitely won't bring any type of alcohol.",

After many years the place is still busy, there's a lively vibe and people of all ages who are clearly enjoying themselves.   The next good sign was the relatively short food and wine menus. We picked a cab from the server's descriptions, and it was perfect. The beans and escarole was a yummy starter, and the ravioli was... well let me say that I'm not easy to please when it comes to Italian food, and especially pasta. But they nailed it.   Delicious, good sized portions, and the service was friendly and impeccable. We had time to enjoy the food, wine and ambience.   My only complaint is that their espresso machine wasn't working that night, but I have no doubt it'll be running the next time.   Oh and towards the end of dinner, from our table on the sidewalk we heard accordion music coming from inside. It looked like a friend of the family had stopped by, the owners and their guests were having a blast. I felt like we were in some forgotten town in Italy!",

The drinks were good, not great, but the gnocchi was super tasty.  We felt right at home, along with the many regulars who were warmly welcomed by the host, a wonderful and thoughtful man. If you want great Italian food, make your way to Girasole.",

The gnocchi were tasty but the best was the ravioli - spinach and ricotta in a tomato cream sauce. All the comfort you could want. Tasty cheese cake as well.   Price was a bit expensive - all told we spent $100 for 2 including drinks and dessert. Definitely a good place to go for a slightly upscale meal without any snootiness.   Bustling and fun environment - we didn't have to wait for a 2 person table on Saturday night, but larger parties would.",

    "text": "Yes, this restaurant is as good as it gets!   This is not your run of the mill, saucy, cheesy laden Italian fare.  NO, this is classic and clean.  The ambiance reminded me of a little trattoria in Florence.  Tiny with warm brick walls and air filled with great aroma's that would remind you of being in Nonna's kitchen.  My mother and I were visiting my daughter who is attending college in Pittsburgh.  We arrived from NJ late but wanted a very nice dinner.  I remember Girasole from another time I visited the city but didn't have the opportunity then.  Too bad really, I've been missing out all this time.  When we arrived, the nice lady took our name and said it was going to be a little while for us to be seated.  There was no wait, it was immediate!  It was so busy in the restaurant but the lovely ladies who served us made the time to be extremely pleasant and attentive.  We first ordered the Antipasto, it was great with prosciutto, soppressata, cheeses, grilled artichokes, olives and roasted tomatoes.  Mom and I ordered their Linguine Rustic and my daughter had the Gnocchi.  OMG, I have had linguine in clam sauce before, but NOT like this.  It was homemade pasta with so many clams in a wonderfully light clam sauce/both.  I tasted the Gnocchi and they were like little pillows of air.  We enjoyed our dinner so much that we decided to make reservations for the next night (Good Friday)  On Friday we got there a little earlier than our reservations, but no problem we were seated immediately.  Our first course was the bruschetta with ricotta, mint pesto, buttery pine nuts and grilled artichoke.  It was a great start.  My daughter and I ordered the Mushroom soup, it was so delicious I really wanted to order a container to take with me.  It was full of mushrooms and a hint of white wine and parmesan cheese.  We all ordered the scallops, mom and I had it with the polenta, my daughter does not like polenta and the waitress advised they are accommodating and changed it out for the gnocchi.  Well, this dish did not disappoint at all, buttery, sweet and tender large sea scallops over creamy, cheesy polenta and topped with spicy arugula.  This is a dish that I will definitely be returning for.  The owner was so sweet both nights giving us a plate of home roasted peppers.  Yummm is all I can say!!!  Next time in Pittsburgh this will be my go to place for wonderful Italian food.  Thank you, Girasole for make our weekend memorable.  Lisa",

PIE, the owner, greets you at the door, you are introduced to his wife, Patty, who is pleasant and welcoming.   Now the server welcomes you and you instantly start chatting.  The place is tastefully decorated, warm and welcoming and now the food arrives. I had the Swordfish special and I can honestly say I have never had a better pieces of fish. My husband had the Pasta Aolio with fresh clams and spinach.  The house salad was quite a meal in itself, fresh greens topped with gorgonzola, it was delightful.  This will definitely be a regular dinner spot for us.  Definitely a 5.",

My mom and I wanted to try out a new Italian restaurant and while a lot of the Italian restaurants are closed on Sunday's, Girasole was opened! It was on my list of restaurants to try and we were not disappointed.   They opened at 4 and we were the first ones to be seated. It did not take long for the place to fill up because it is pretty small inside. I wouldn't suggest bringing a large party here. Though it may be small, I loved the atmosphere. I loved the stone walls and fancy European paintings on the walls.   Our waitress was excellent and very accommodating. I ordered the potato gnocchi with mozzarella and a whole lot of sauce and my mom ordered the ricotta cavatelli with brown sauce and pine nuts. Instead of the lamb meatballs she substituted it with shrimp. We each got salads that were very delicious and a pretty decent size. Some of the toppings included, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato and mozzarella to name a few. The bread they brought out was also very fresh!  We were in and out very fast, the service was prompt and we like that! Keep in mind parking is going to be tricky and you may have to walk to get here but it is worth it!",

We ordered a variety of apps to share and brought a few bottles of wine to share. The BYOB was $7, a little steep -- especially since we also had people drinking single bottles of beer. Didn't realize this until the bill came.  As far as main dishes, our group was really happy with everything. I had a short rib special and it was phenomenal -- even as leftovers the next day. We also ordered a few desserts to share. The tiramisu and lemon desserts were the biggest hit.  Service was great. We were there for about two hours and wouldn't have changed a thing.",

I ordered the penne. It was topped with marinara sauce with small pieces of hot sausage, topped with shredded cheese of course! The entree came with a fresh salad with a light balsamic dressing.  It's a BYOB, with a $7 cork charge. The prices for the menu items are not bad for the portions they serve( salad and bread were included with our meal). However, the menu is not extensive, which I prefer (easier to decide). The atmosphere has a nice Italian charm to it, and the dining room is on the smaller side. So it is very easy to feel crowed. Overall, I give it a thumbs up and will return!",

I work in a family owned business and customer service-- I would never even think of acting the way he did.   I had a reservation a week in advance for 7 pm. We arrived before 7, but no one acknowledged us for over 15 minutes. By the time the owner/host came over to seat people, he took two other parties in front of us who DID NOT have reservations and who arrived AFTER us. At this point, I walked over to him and said, \"We had a reservation for 7 pm, but it seems other people are being seated ahead of us.\" At this point, the OWNER started yelling at me in front of everyone at the restaurant. Keep in mind this is a small restaurant and there were several others crowded around the area where we were waiting. He started yelling at me and saying, \"what do you want me to do? Remove people from their tables so you can sit there?\" I politely said, \"No, that's not what I'm saying..\" and then he started yelling again and saying things to the other customers about me! I was so embarrassed so we walked out and left. I should have spoken up for myself, but it truly wasn't worth arguing with this man.   I have been to this establishment several times. The food is nothing special, but I like to give business to small business owners. I can assure I will NEVER go back, and I will NEVER recommend it. If you're looking for a friendly staff, definitely stay away from Girasole.   Truly disgusted with his behavior.",

We couldn't have had a better experience.   8/24- we went again with another person who had celiac and same experience- this place is a gem!

    "text": "Most restaurants don't even come close to having as much soul as Girasole. They've created such a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere in such a tiny space, and I find that the noisy closeness actually produces more intimate dinner conversation because your fellow diners--although right beside you--are also engaging in conversation at a normal volume. The result is a wonderful din that provides all the privacy you could ask for in a warm little stone room full of delicious smells.   I've been to Girasole several times over the past couple of years, and they've never disappointed me. I've read the other reviews that talk about bad service and an unpleasant host, but every single server and especially the host have always been such wonderful, real people doing great work. I've had nothing but exceptional service, and the host always seats us well and very quickly even when there doesn't appear to be an empty seat in the place. The host is a lovely fixture and quite a character--just what any authentically Italian American restaurant requires. The staff is very down to earth and not at all pompous about the high-quality, honest food. You feel like a part of their family as soon as you step inside.  I was especially amazed that my friend was able to make a reservation for 9 people on my birthday--9 people is like 1/4 of the restaurant. I cannot believe anyone who says that they don't accommodate reservations. And they took really good care of us, which I know can't be fun or easy on even the best server.  Now, the food! Let's start with the free stuff. The never-ending complimentary bread is perfect. The oil and balsamic vinegar with a dash of salt makes it heaven--just as good if not better than the NOT-complimentary bread served throughout Italy these days. The house salad that comes with every entree is also so divine that I could never even dream of swapping it for one of the soups. It has chickpeas, sunflower seeds, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, plus red onions and gorgonzola which are optional. And I'd give them my first born for the vinaigrette recipe.  The entrees are mostly seasonal with a few favorites that stick around all year--the spinach ricotta raviolis for example. I have several friends who have declared this dish to be their final meal choice without question. I agree that the tomato cream sauce should be illegal. One of the chicken of the day specials was particularly memorable as well--probably the best chicken marsala I've ever had by a long shot. The pastas are always winners--just take your pick.  Finally, their cocktails have got to be the most underrated in the city. The \"Italian Man\" in particular cannot be rivaled in my humble opinion. The bourbon, averno amaro, carpano antica, bitters, and flamed orange peel are in perfect harmony, and I fail every time to recreate his rugged beauty in my own kitchen. If I'd give up my first born for the vinaigrette, I'd sell my soul to be able to make the Italian Man cocktail.   If you're still not convinced, visit on a Tuesday night when they have a live singer guitarist who is worth sticking around for. Just request anything by Van Morrison--you'll leave very, very happy.",

We had thought about getting reservations but the hours that came with my gift card said No Reservations.  The decor of the restaurant was very nice. They had copper tables in a cramped type of environment that is very European.  We decided to forgo appetizers this day and instead got drinks.  I had something that resembled a manhattan while my dining partner had the Bellini and both were good.  Since my dining partner and I both ordered entrees we were served with a dinner salad.  It was one of the nicer salads that I have had with Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds and chick peas amongst the greens and a nice vinaigrette paired with it.  For dinner I had the pumpkin ravioli while my dining partner had the porcini gnocchi.  The pumpkin ravioli was absolutely delicious although only receiving 5 for the price that was paid was a bit disappointing.  The gnocchi was much more substantial though and just as tasty.  For dessert we had the lemon cake which was fantastic and came with fresh raspberries and blackberries as a garnish.  When all was said and done it was by far some of the best food that I have tasted recently and all of my concerns from previous posts were undone with the service being great and having no wait for our table.  The bottom line for me is that this restaurant had wonderful food and not too high of a price point and I will definitely be back.  I would recommend that you go early on a weekday though as the seating is very limited.",

There was NO organization as far as a list or order and because of that the owner kept seating locals and our party -- as well as another from out of town -- just waited in the street. Tables were finished and bills settled, yet not bussed and cleaned quickly. One such table on the sidewalk was a folding temporary table like those found at Office Depot for $20. The owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us. I understand waiting and being patient, I even understand taking care of your regulars, but to treat \"out of towners\" in this manner is UNACCEPTABLE! By 8:30 or so we just walked off in disgust and found a friendlier atmosphere to dine in and were accepted with open arms. Is the food good at Girasole? WHO KNOWS, we didn't get a chance to sample anything and after the wait, we could care less about the food. Personally, I can't imagine enjoying what might be a nice meal when folks are treated like we were. GET ORGANIZED WITH A SYSTEM OR LIST, COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE WHO ARE WAITING PATIENTLY, DON'T CRAP ON NON-LOCALS, AND DON'T MAKE FOLKS WAIT THAT LONG WHO HAVE A RESERVATION (and if we have to wait, talk to us and share the situation and DON'T seat locals in front of us who arrived much later). Sort through and read the many other reviews and you will see a similar trend in the owner's pathetic seating protocol (or lack thereof).",

    "text": "What is there to say about Girasole? An Italian owner who wanders around the restaurant (often with a glass of wine) greeting friends and customers and kibitzing with staff; a friendly staff; and fantastic food. Seriously, the food is great. Order anything on the menu & you won't be disappointed.  The best part about Girasole, though, is the intimate indoor & outdoor atmosphere & the wine. Pours are generous, and there's a fantastic selection to choose from. If you're having difficulty, your server will be happy to help you, too (ask for Ryan). Did I mention the wine? Seriously, the pours are generous, and if you MUST bring your own, bring a lot, because the corking fee is very reasonable.",

    "text": "For my 100th review...I'm taking it back home.   Girasole is a lovely little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street. They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it's definitely ideal for a date in the summer. Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive.   My friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans. The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy, plump fresh tomatoes . We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness.   We also split the bruschetta, which came styled with ricotta cheese. It was also delicious.   I picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which were large little pillows of warm goodness. I think there were only 4, but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce. The herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish.   Everything at Girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor. Anytime I'm home I come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun. Classic Italian food.",

The only issue we had was when patrons waiting to get in would hold the door open and let in the 45 draft of chilly air.  We had to ask three times to get different patrons to close the door.  Management should not have allow diners seated near the front door to suffer like that.    The tiramisu was unique - and fabulous!  If you don't know the area, make sure to check the location of parking garages because street parking is very difficult to find.  BTW, the copper-topped tables are really cool.",

The food is amazing, the atmosphere fantastic and the waitstaff, attentive. It feels like you are eating dinner in a wine cellar-super cozy. A great place for a date!  To the negative reviewers: If you have a problem waiting then don't go to a tiny restaraunt on a Friday or Saturday night and expect to get seated immediately. Or have some patience.  My recommendation: call and make a reservation for a little earlier than you would prefer to eat. Go check in, the owner (a very charasmatic little italian Pittsburgher) will take your number and then go across the street to Alto and have a drink or two and relax. I highly recommend eating here- the specials are always great and the sunflower seed dressing is to die for.",

    "text": "As a starting point, this is my first Yelp review, ever. But I thought that the rude behavior that my boyfriend and I were subjected to at this restaurant needed to be highlighted.  We decided last minute to go to Girasole for our anniversary dinner. I have been to Girasole several times before, and before I say anything else I will note that the food here has consistently been excellent. It is also the only decent Italian restaurant in the Shadyside area.  We headed over around at 8:45, knowing that the place would likely be crowded on a Friday night and that we would need to wait. When we walked into the restaurant, we were barely acknowledged by who could only be the boorish owner, who was apparently the one in charge of seating people. The place was packed, and we were literally standing on top of the patrons whose table was closest to the door. In order to ease the space issue, at the next moment I get (which is about 10 minutes later) I asked the owner approximately how long the wait would be, thinking that we could perhaps put our name down and stand outside to wait. Before I could even finish asking, the owner barked QUITE loudly at my boyfriend, \"Well I guess you guys better leave!\" Which we did.  I find it unfortunate that the owner can treat patrons in such an outwardly offensive manner and still be able to maintain a successful business.",

    "text": "My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \"list\". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \"out of towners\" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before).   We subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.",

It was cooked beautifully and has great taste.   The customer service was great when we arrived to the store.

I've been driving around through the more urban areas thanks to Garmin's preference of ease over safety -- and I drove past a Little Italy sign.  Perfecto!  But it just looked like a shopping mall -- and I didn't see anything Italian, other than someone wearing an MTV's Jersey Shore t-shirt.  Anyways, near me was Girasole -- with takeout.  So this review has nothing to say on service or atmosphere.  The food, however, was really good.   The side salad with the entrees was excellent -- with a lot of extras, such as chickpeas, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, etc.  Most side salads are just dumped from a Costco \"Bag of Salad,\" but this was really nice, and could stand alone as its own entree.  The gnocchi was pretty soft and light -- the ravioli tender and juicy -- and the sauces were excellent.  Again, these were eaten out of a container, on our moving boxes, with no wine (spare your gasp, I know).  I think the prices are a bit on the higher end of the 'burgh, and would've expected a bit more for the price, but overall pretty satisfied.",

The ambience is such that it can be romantic for a date, yet also allow for families and larger parties to have a good time.    The food was above average for pittsburgh italian, 4 stars for sure.  It just is difficult for me to find many, if any, restaurants in pittsburgh that can match the quality of restaurants in philly or nyc.  I had a special that had scallops, shrimp, on a polenta bed with spinach, and it was as tasty as it sounds.   Most of my friends enjoyed their meals.  The issue came with wine.  They have a unique concept of serving their own wine while also allowing you to BYO.  They do serve a corkage fee, however, they absurdly charge a per person, per glass charge instead of one price for the bottle! It's a CORKAGE fee, charge for the bottle! Between 8 of us, we spent nearly $70 on 2 measly bottles of wine, that is absolutely ridiculous.  I could have drank one of their wines and it would have been cheaper (but not better).  And when I inquired about it, they went with the thats our policy line, though, the waitress did subliminally acknowledge the absurdity of their policy.  Overall, still, worth visiting for the above average italian cuisine with solid specials and pleasant ambience.",

The pace was very good and we were not feeling ignored or rushed.  Once again, our waitress provided a real service by honestly answering our menu questions.  We went with her recommendation of Meza Rigatoni and the Risotto.  The ragu for the rigatoni was perfection and the pasta, spot on - el dente.  The risotto was a bowl of passion, skill and delicious ingredients, the best we have tasted.  I was considering walking into the kitchen and hugging people.  My wife and I are travelers and we spend an embarrassing amount of our budget on dining out.  Trust me when I say this place is a must visit.  I have fallen in love and I can't wait to go back!",

The texture of the ravioli shell was perfect - slightly al dente and thick, perfectly complimenting the fragrant tomato cream sauce. And I had just tried making a batch of my own risotto and failed (it was much too soft), so I could appreciate the precise crunchy-to-creamy ratio of Girasole's risotto. It tasted even better as leftovers the next day. And staying True to their name (girasole means sunflower in Italian), their fresh salad was served with crisp roasted sunflower seeds.  So why the three-star rating? You know the feeling of gazing into a cozy home on a cold night, with your nose pressed against the window, longing to come inside and rest by the hearth? That's how I felt the entire time I was eating here. The restaurant's interior is enchanting - warmly lit with charming artistic details. I was so excited to experience that atmosphere, but no - we weren't allowed to. Even though we had made an 8 PM reservation, they seated customers without reservations inside, and put us at a ramshackle table beneath a flight of stairs outdoors. There were not even enough chairs for all three of us at that table. I had to grab a chair for myself, and just as I was getting comfortable in my seat, one of the waiters rudely told me to move. In fact, it seemed like my chair was always in some waiter or customer's way; I had to keep moving it throughout dinner. The table was extremely unstable, and our waitress had to put something under one of the legs so that our food and candle would not fall off. I'm not even sure what she used because it was so dark. Next time, I'm ordering take out from this place - love the food, but I'd skip the makeshift service and overcrowded environment in a heartbeat.",

Since I am a vegetarian, I asked the host if we can see a menu before asking to be seated.  I don't think this was too much to ask but the older gentleman who was the host that evening practically asked me to leave.  He told me that if I wanted to know what they served, just look at the people's food while pointing to the food at a couples table that were sitting right next to us.  He practically put his hand in their food.  I explained that I was vegetarian and just wanted to see the vegetarian options and he shouted that if I'm looking for vegetarian to go next door to the restaurant.  I was appalled!  I turned around and looked at my sister who was just as surprised to hear such rudeness coming from the host of thisrestaurant.  I then turned around and walked out.

    "text": "My dining experience at Girasole's earned 5 stars for atmosphere, presentation, service and deliciousness. The owner gave us a warm welcome and the food and service truly were exceptional. Based on conversation in the taxi ride back to our hotel, the 5 people I had invited to dinner agreed. We also agreed that everyone was uncomfortable ordering  from a menu with no prices on 3 out of 4 of the main courses, the \"secondi\" selections. The menu states there are 3 market priced items. Inside the menu is a sheet of paper with the current date describing the days meat, chicken and fish specials. Prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either. I find that to be extremely disrespectful, not only to the diner who is paying for dinner but also to the guests. As dinner was my treat, I felt very awkward asking for prices. My waiter (the owner's son) asked the table if we had any questions about the menu. Really? Since the restaurant doesn't print prices I find it extra rude that the waiter doesn't mention them. Note that risotto, the only entree with a price, is $20. The beef turns out to be $35. It's fortunate for the waiter that a 20% gratuity was added to my bill because I wasn't feeling too generous when he delivered it. Putting the price disclosure issue aside however, I would happily rate Girasole 5 stars and I will recommend it to friends.",

    "text": "I have never been so irritated while waiting for a meal. I wish I could write a review on the wonderful food that I've heard is served there, but I guess I'll never get the opportunity. Myself and four friends called and made a reservation at 6:15pm for a table at 8:30pm. We were told that there would be a table waiting for us and when we arrived at 8:20 to sit, we were told that the next table would be ours. Around 8:45 I spoke with what appeared to be the \"hostess\", and she was practically useless and told us that they didn't accept reservations. Why we weren't told that when we called, I'm not sure. After she somewhat frantically looked around and asked if we had talked to \"the man\" who we presumed to be the manager/owner of the restaurant, she told us that it would be about 20-25 minutes until another table was available. We left, very irritated and hungry, and I immediately created a yelp account because of the terrible service and attitude from the people who work there.",

    "text": "They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded.    Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner.  Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table.  Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate!  Pasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great.  $20 for noodles and meat sauce...   Dinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices.    Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had.     Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent.  I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!  Overall a very disapointing night out.",

Usually very reasonably priced under $20 and HUGE portions. Besides, the Girasole salad with chicken is one of my all time favorite salads. IT's also a cozy little place for a friendly dinner. Not one of your romantic restaurants though, because it is small and gets loud. Make reservations ahead.",

The food is fantastic - any of their raviolis will do.  Service is attentive, and their pastas come with soup or a hefty salad.  Reasonable prices, given the quality.",

    "text": "I've been going to Girasole's for years with my family and friends. I've had basically every vegetarian and fish dish, always to a great pleasure. The wine list is short but excellently prepared, the chianti is always superb - sempre!  For those who complain about space clearly do not understand the dynamics of a small restaurant space that would rather have a few tightly packed tables then actually take tables away. Either people would complain about their not being enough tables or that there isn't enough room, Girasoles choose the latter. Dinners are too spoiled in Pittsburgh, they expect good food to be accompanied by enough space for a family of 8, not to mention they have a fear of being close to fellow dinners - though I have no idea why?  I recommend going for lunch - particularly if you don't like crowds. You'll most likely get to meeting Phi or Geno which guarantees great conversation and a great experience.",

Risotto is always a great choice if you're in doubt. Wine selection is delicious, too!  The decor is warm, with beautiful copper-topped tables and intimate seating. Waiters and \"Mr. Girasole\" are friendly (and offered me a free apertif when I mentioned it was my birthday last year!) but not plying.   Honestly, I haven't found a better restaurant in Pittsburgh -- although I wouldn't bring a group here. Seating is tight and the prices are on the spendy side.",

Seats around 48, so everyone was a little close to each other.  Didn't matter though because there is enough conversation in the air to keep things private. Menu was varied with enough choices for all food tastes.  The lamb meatball appetizer was a great surprise, as were the mussels.  They were the most tender and flavorful I have ever eaten!  Both will be ordered again.  The cheese tortellini with pancetta and peas was a huge hit, and I was sorry that I opted for the penne and sauce.  Not familiar with Italian wines, but the chardonnay version was delicious.  Saw some people bringing their own wine, which was a surprise. Made reservation, which was necessary for a Saturday night.",

    "text": "I am from Pittsburgh, but now live in Detroit and I think about Girasole often as a special place to go when you want some great Italian comfort food, and a loud, bustling atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and you'll often see Mr. Girasole walking back and forth, checking how you like your meal and pouring more wine.  This small and very quaint Italian restaurant is located in the heart of Shadyside.  You have to walk down about 6 or 7 steps to get to the door, so if you are handicapped or elderly, it may be a tad tough.  It is a little pricey, but for good, Italian like your Mamma makes, it's worth it.  I had the pumpkin ravioli and the house salad.  I loved the salad dressing--it's light and delicious and the pumpkin ravioli was excellent as well.  I really chowed on the thick slices of Italian bread and they willingly brought lots more upon request.  We had a party of 9 and were happy to have made a reservation in advance.  Go early on a weekend evening as the wait looked treacherous by the time we left the restaurant at 7:00PM.  Girasole reminds me of eating in my Italian Grandma's basement kitchen!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the servers were a bit slow in providing basics like water and silverware in the beginning of the meal.  Otherwise, Manga! Manga!",
