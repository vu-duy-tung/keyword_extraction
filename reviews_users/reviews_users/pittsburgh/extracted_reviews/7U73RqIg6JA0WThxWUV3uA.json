The soup dumplings, which used to be one of the strongest menu items, are now bland and overcooked.  The last time fresh spring rolls were ordered they were obviously old and had been sitting in the refrigerator for several days. We've tried to order several items the last couple of times only to be consistently told that they are unavailable, leaving us with more run-of the mill choices that could be obtained at any other number of Chinese restaurants in the area.  This had been a nice option for us with a child who is only interested in \"Americanized\" Chinese, since they offer both that and more authentic dishes on the menu. However, with the prices being significantly higher than other area restaurants and the food quality being just mediocre at this point, we will not be going back.",

It is not a fine dining place so do not expect a romantic dining experience. It is more like a Chinese restaurant trimmed for Americans. Anyway, our server, Marlene, (yes we asked her name) was one of the best servers we had at a $$ restaurant in the US. She answered our questions, helped us finding what we were looking for at the menu and explained what we should expect from our meal. Regularly checked how we were doing. She made our dining experience better.",

The quality of the food here is about average, but the prices are more expensive than most Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. I've had their wok menu items, veggies, skewer items, and mapo tofu ... I would say the best item I found to be was the mapo tofu, which was perfectly soft and was not too overpowering. Really liked the spiciness of the dish as it was on a level higher than what other competitors in the local area had it and was reflective of the Szechuan nature of the dish (really spicy). In short, it seems to be more of a place catered to American tastes than to those looking for authentic Szechuan cuisine although I will say ... they do have a Chinese menu now for those who are looking for more authentic Chinese cuisine.",

Today large numbers of Chinese guests and no nonAsians. Not surprising since the cook is from Chendu (near Sichuan) and he seems imprevious to requests. Every time that I have visited with guests, we asked the dishes to be less \"hot\" ie decrease the numbers of red hot peppers and as far as I can tell, the dishes remained \"hot\" and the number of red peppers seemed excessive given our reguest.   The prices are relatively high compared to Red Tea House and Sesame Inn. That said, I love Sichuan food and \"hot\" dishes. Simple Chinese dishes are great including steamed pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, the small soups (eg seafood corn chowder)  and large bowls of noodle soup. And I recommend these dishes for nonAsians - they are delicious and low-priced.  The hand-pulled noodle dishes are exceptional and compare favorably with Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill. The wok dishes are the delicious highlight of the restaurant.  I will expand on my review once I have sampled more of them. Service is outstanding.",

    "text": "With restaurants such as Jade Grille, it's disheartening to see people continue to disregard Pittsburgh's South Hills. Carrying every bit of the culinary swagger and swanky ambience of East End restaurants, Jade Grille could easily compete in a larger metropolitan area. This much was in evidence one frosted recent weekday evening when Kay and I decided to pop in for dinner.   Housed in what used to be a bank, one might feel initially unwelcome due to the elegant, nightclub-ish interiors that are punctuated by overhead lamps that resemble miniature suns and a vault door that leads to a private room. However, when you're greeted by a waitress who looks like she moonlights as a roller derby queen, you'll feel less self-conscious about your pocket t-shirt and carpenter jeans.   As I often do when I dine at Asian restaurants, I gravitated towards the smaller dishes since I tend to find them more provocative. First at bat from JG's sushi bar was the Sashimi Ceviche. Tender, buttery, raw, fresh, and refreshingly cold chunks of slippery tuna, salmon, and yellowtail were garnished with red onion, tomato, jalapeno, and cilantro, all of which was dressed with a lemon juice and ponzu. Bold flavors abounded. There was sweetness, zip, bitterness, nip. Texturally dynamic, velvet contrasted with crunch as the juicy and the saltish mingled, each component bringing out the best in each other. A standing ovation was in order for this pleasantly palate-clearing warm-up act.   The whimsically-named Dan Dan Noodles (I know a slew of Dans) were deceptively hearty despite the modest portion. Laugh at me for saying so, but I kept being reminded of a chili or a spaghetti topped with pork bolognese. The thick, glossy, soft, oily, noodles themselves were topped with a mixture of spicy minced pork, which is where the simple beauty of this rich, addictive tapa lies. You're damn right I was left craving more of it.   And there was more to eat. A trio of skewered ruddy quail eggs wrapped in bacon and glazed over with some sort of barbeque sauce helped to extinguish whatever bellyfire remained. Almost candylike, their squishy, plush innards and crisp, salty hides had me thinking of Devils on Horseback, that classic Yuletide finger food of the British Isles.    Also acting as an exercise in caramelized cunning was Kay's more conventional (JG has a section of their menu devoted to Americanized items for the timid) Honey Walnut Chicken, of which I gladly ate up a brittle, succulent, nectarous sample.   Let Jade Grille take you on a tour of the Asian continent within the safe environs of one of the nation's coziest suburbs. Hop on a trolley, and get your skinny hipster butts over here for lunch or dinner this instant!",

    "text": "Jade Grille is by far one of my favorite restaurants around Pittsburgh.  The first time that I had food from here was when I was visiting a friend who lives in Mt. Lebanon and we ordered take out.  My partner and I loved the food so when we were craving Chinese food the other night we \"made the trek\" from Brighton Heights to Mt. Lebanon to dine at Jade Grille.  Parking was easy to find even on a Friday night and we were seated right away.    We ordered several things to share and still had leftovers to take home.  We started off with the Jade Spring Roll which are rice paper wraps filled with avocado, cucumber, shrimp and basil that comes with a peanut dipping sauce - you get 2 for $5 and they were delicious.  We also had the Go Go Shrimp which are crispy fried shrimp in a spicy honey sauce which had large chunks of chopped red pepper - this was my favorite portion of our meal that night - the portion was large enough for us to both have a significant amount and take some home for later.  For our main course we shared King Kong Roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese topped with eel and avocado, and the Cumin Style Beef which is listed under Wok Authentic Chinese Cuisine on the menu - this is a spicy dish where the meat is crusted in cumin then stir fried with dried peppers, onions, peppers, and cilantro - the beef was tender and the spice level was great though we did ask for some chili oil on the side because we love spicy food.  We had enough to take half of the Cumin Style Beef home as well.    Overall, while the prices may seem a little steep to some, given that we both were full by the end of our meal and had enough to take home, I think that the portions and the quality of the food are well worth the price.  They also have a nice selection of sake, wine and beer.  Our server Marie was fantastic - friendly and a great server.  I look forward to returning.",

You will not regret this), avocado salad, and salmon skewers. They have an awesome $10 for $20 Yelp deal, too. FYI they have a Chinese menu that's not printed! You've got to be in the know. Found out only because I asked the waitresses to which dishes were some of yelp pictures referring.  I went here with a few friends after running a local 10K. Wow. It was just what we wanted after a hilly run. Great drink selection. Large menu. My friends really enjoyed their sushi rolls, soups, and spicy chicken over rice. Our waitress was very patient and attentive, too. Last random comment, the seats in the booth were super comfortable... :-)  Hope to return soon!",

The hostess and wait staff seemed very disorganized and confused this evening. When getting led/sat at a table, it felt like we were being taken on a tour through the dining room. Let me add, the restaurant was not a full house.     Once seated (oh yes, I timed this), it took 7 minutes for our server to greet us and get our drink order. 5 minutes for us to get our water and iced tea, and another 6 minutes for us to receive our beer. The app did not come out before our entrees, rather it came out with it. We were obviously not being attended to, as was everyone else around us.    The food tasted good. The sushi could have been wrapped tighter. The service could have been A LOT better. The prices were a little steep.    A little tangent for this one.. Now, I understand it is hard to find good help when owning a restaurant or any other establishment, but when you start hiring the friends of the other sucky employees you already have, you are up to a lot of stress and heart ache.

Needless to say the steamed dumplings and crab rangoons were cold and soggy. The sushi was great, except for the fact we had already eaten assuming the delivery was never going to arrive.

They did forget to give me eating utensils and napkins!  (thank goodness hotel gave me those when I went downstairs).  As for the food, very good!  I wanted carbs so the Japchae was great!  And I started with the sui mai dumplings - those were delicious.  You'll see that the prices were a bit pricey but they didn't charge for delivery and the online ordering was a breeze using YELP.

    "text": "Swung by here for lunch on a Saturday.  We were seated and serviced quickly in the mostly empty restaurant, and service was attentive and super efficient throughout the whole meal.  My S.O. and I ordered the SPICES CHILI POT with vegetables, the DOUBLE COOKED pork, and the CUMIN STYLE lamb.  Each dish came with a choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup or a salad and a bowl of rice.  I appreciated the choice of brown rice, which most traditional Chinese restaurants don't provide.  Portion sizes for our dishes were on the small side, even for lunch portions.  Although all three plates were decent enough, we found the flavor to be a bit off for each.  The double cooked pork was both our favorites by far, though I would have appreciated much more black bean flavor than was added--I felt that the pork was pretty bland on its own (besides its intrinsic porkiness) and wasn't able to absorb much of the flavor at all.  My fiancee is a pork belly slut and therefore had no complaints.    The spices chili pot was rather lacking in spices--namely, chilis for heat and Sichuan pepper, which was largely absent in the dish.  I definitely appreciated, however, that they accommodated my vegetable-only order of the dish, which isn't a choice on the menu.    The cumin style lamb was the biggest disappointment.  My fiancee complained that the lamb itself was lacking its distinct grassy lambiness (\"This could be beef, and I wouldn't know the difference.\"), and I complained that it just didn't taste as the traditional dish ought to--the flavor was all cumin and nothing else--no coriander, no pepper (black, white, or Sichuan), no sesame, no soy...just...straight up...cumin, overwhelmingly so.  The name of the dish shouldn't be taken so literally.  The meal was worth it with the great Yelp deal, but unless I find myself in the neighborhood, I won't be back.  Sichuan Gourmet is too much more convenient to us in the city and too much tastier and authentic.",

    "text": "It just happened to be a coincidence that the section of the street that this restaurant is on was closed this past Saturday due to a street party.  It was hard to get to the restaurant but I had parked on a block behind Washington.    We were greeted and seated very quickly and we had to go over the menu a few times because there were a lot of choices to make between appetizers, sushi, noodles, hot pots etc.  The menu has a really nice variety of Asian dishes and it was hard to choose from them but we did eventually make our choice.    They had a good choice of beers on tap and even had a variety of special sake.  We had started with the garlic and basil deep fried wings and the steamed dumplings which didn't take that long to come out.  The wings were cooked properly, through and through.  The sauce and spice were very good.  I can't say I've had wings like this before, saucy yet crunchy but the sauce along with the basil was such a unique taste.    The steamed dumplings were as expected but the meat had a very good taste.  Again, perfectly cooked... chewy outside and not soggy at all.  The appetizers were wonderful.  Our server had asked us if we wanted the sushi ahead of the pots and I had said yes.    I had ordered 2 rolls... a twin dragon roll and a crazy gaga roll.  If I recall correctly the twin dragon had both lobster and shrimp and the gaga was a spicy tuna with salmon and jalepeno on top.  The quality of the rolls, fish and construction was great.  As far as rolls go these were both well done.    Lastly we had ordered two hot pots.  The menu is full of a variety of hot pots (a dozen or more) some of which have a choice of which meat you would like from chicken, beef, seafood or veal.  I had ordered the hot sauce beef and my wife had ordered the Hawaii Five 0 which is a mixed seafood pot.  Each pot gave us a choice of rice (white, brown and another I can't remember).    TIP:  Each pot is enough to feed 2 to 3 people but each is only served with a single serving rice.  The pots are absolutely huge. If I had known how large the serving was I would have just ordered one to share instead of two.  Great if you want to take it out afterwards.  The food at Jade Grille was superb.  I've had my fair share of Asian food from many Asian restaurants and I have to say this place served a good variety of tasty food.    Overall the experience was top notch.  The server was very helpful and attentive.  The ambiance was good with the nice soft lighting, good tunes and great food.

Moderate decorated compare to a lot of Chinese restaurant. I'm not sure if the other Chinese restaurants just don't care about service and decorations or some other reason that they might have that I am not sure about. Usually they are minimum decorated. But not this place, this place was turned into a restaurant from a bank. They use the safe room to host large parties. An interesting point I think is that they kept the safe door. I would go back there and recommend it to friends.",

It's in a good area, decent parking, and shops surrounding/connected. Fun outside of restaurant.  We started off with crab rangoons. They had enough filling, were crispy, and awesome duck sauce.  I ordered the Saigon sunset - really awesome cocktail!! I took a picture of the cocktail menu just so I could recreate that deliciousness at home. If you like cinnamon & tequila - order this and thank me later.  I ordered the lobster tempura roll (only $10), which was simple but delicious. It came with purple rice which added a very subtle sweetness but enhanced the roll in itself.  My friend ordered the volcano roll. That was a lot more of different flavors in a bite, but still yummy - he is more adventurous in the sushi department than myself.  They had Mochi ice cream on the menu, which made us smile, but the waitress said how she loved Mochi and she wasn't a fan of theirs so we opted to head next door to a homemade ice cream shop.  Will definitely be back when in the mood for some sushi!",

Then got our entrees Beef w/ Broccoli with brown sauce mild ample serving very tasty. Chile Pot spiced beef . Excellent beef very tasty and tender and great vegetables topped with cilantro.Hot and spicy . Veggies with chicken and garlic sauce very good . The 4th entree was a problem GongBao Chicken. Our teenage grandson bit into something he didn't like ( he likes everything) and showed us the stem. Called waitress over and she said probably ginger. He continued eating then ate it again by accident and once again a small stem. He got up from his seat to go bathroom to spit it out and wash out his mouth. We  had waitress remove the dish .He came  back and said could still feel it. Described as dry ice and numbing. We asked if hot ( he loves hot ) and he said no. When we left another employee asked how we liked our meal .I explained and he said oh numbing peppers . He said to request without . We came home and googled and saw an excellent article in Smithsonian on numbing peppers . They are not hot . It is a very different sensation. Best description is numbling . I have used Szechuan peppercorns in cooking for years  but these were very different . Perhaps they were fresh vs dried as I buy. We are all anxious to return again but will be sure ask for no numbing peppers or have them on the side.",

    "text": "Favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! I love that they have a huge menu including both Chinese and Americanized Chinese foods to please all the people in the group. Jade Grille makes the best, in my humble opinion, version of my favorite Chinese dish - I get the garlic eggplant every time! It's sweet, spicy, and lots of subtle seasonings like green onion and ginger in there too. Every dish I've ordered has been delicious and good portions (on the larger side). The service is always courteous and prompt, too. The restaurant's atmosphere is classy - it's built in an old bank. Definitely nice enough for a special occasion but also not too pretentious for a meal any day of the week. Can't wait to go back!",

Food wise, the cooked dishes are decent and the kids menu is good, but the sushi is always hit or miss, the won ton soup is fairly bland, and the service is frustratingly slow. Tonight it took over 45 minutes to get an order of sushi and in previous visits it has taken 30+ minutes to get extra sauce or chopsticks.",

    "text": "I was extremely impressed with my first visit to this restaurant. Housed in a former bank building they use \"the vault\" for group events.  I had made a reservation and was immediately greeted and seated by a wonderful hostess and waitress who advised me where I could sit where i would feel the most comfortable.   She helped me interpret the menu since they offer lunch specials for a great deal. You would get an entree, your choice of white, brown, or fried rice and then either their soup of the day or salad with ginger dressing. The soup of the day was eggdrop and since it was hot I opted for the salad.   They offer authentic Chinese wok cuisine or if you prefer wok American Chinese cuisine. I decided to try the shrimp and scallops with mixed vegetables for my main course. I also wanted to try a sushi but she recommended that I try one of their rolls instead. I'm usually not a fan of raw fish so she suggested I try the sweet potato tempura roll. You are given both chopsticks and of course regular silverware to eat with.  The sweet potato roll had one sweet potato fry hanging out from each cut and was indeed very delicious. Shortly after I got my main course. The shrimp and scallops were a nice size and the brown sauce did not make it spicy. I'm not a spice person but they have plenty other options if you are.  The entree was very good. Needless to say, I normally go easy on the rice because I like to enjoy my entire portion. My waitress was very helpful and attended to all my needs.  There are some things I must point out however. Restrooms are located down a long flight of steps but well kept. I later learned they do have a handicapped restroom on the main floor level since the elevator in this building does not work.  Also, if you are looking for General Tso's chicken,It is listed only on the dinner menu where they have tangerine orange style wok with your choice of meat or shrimp.. That can be made General Tso style. I, however, was so pleased with my meal I didn't even think of that item.  They have a full bar and they serve regular mixed drinks including sake. Vegetarian options are available as well as take out.  Finally they are one of the few restaurants that do validate your parking garage ticket if you parking in the nearby garage.  I am really anxious to return here again and try some of their other offerings. Next time I may try one of their authentic Chinese cuisine wok meals.",

From the first to final bite of the leftovers, this savory and satisfying food certainly left me craving more.  In the Lo mein, the pieces of chicken were large and juicy.  They were some of the most tender pieces of chicken that I have ever had.  The noodles were buttered to perfection and the vegetables were delicious.  The sesame chicken was fantastic.  I don't know what that sauce was but it was an amazing taste.  The broccoli scattered in was small, but crisp and it packed a punch of flavor.  The only issue I had was that the rice containers were a bit too small, but the rice was fantastic.  All in all, this place is fantastic and something that you should definitely consider checking out if you find yourself in uptown mt. Lebanon.",

I've never used a service like that before so I was a bit skeptical whether or not they would deliver to my residence. I ordered the MaPo Tofu (liked how silky the tofu was but didn't care too much for it since I'm not too big of a fan regarding spicy foods, however my husband enjoyed it), Sesame Chicken (looked a bit dry but looks were definitely deceiving with this one. The chicken was cooked really well and I was even surprised to see some hidden broccoli underneath), Dan Dan Noodles (I've never had this dish before and it has become one of my favorites), Hot & Sour Soup (my husband had this, and he liked it a lot. It was actually soupy and not loaded with a thickener like cornstarch), and the Hirumi Sushi roll (I was thrown off by the color of the rice but that just intrigued me even more. I'm so particular with sushi and I'm glad to say that I very much  enjoyed the sushi roll). All in all, each item were delicious! My husband and I can't wait to try out the other menu items, maybe even dine at the restaurant itself. I'll definitely order more sushi next time.",

They also have sushi, but we love the Chinese food so much, we've never tried the sushi. One of my favorite things about Jade Grille is that they have an  authentic menu and an American menu. We've tried from both menus and nothing has ever failed us. When ordering takeout, I usually just order straight from the Yelp app which is super convenient. However, the space in the restaurant is actually quite nice for dining in, which isn't typically True for most authentic Chinese restaurants. I highly recommend Jade Grille for authentic Chinese food in the south hills!",

Everything was delicious and incredibly fresh! And came in large portions - I have two more meals left. The noodles are some of the best homemade noodles I've had. The fish was also some of the freshest I've ever had.   My one complaint is that the person who packed my to go bag put the sushi on top of my hot lomein. Luckily, I saw right away and removed it from the bag. Otherwise, this easily could've been a low score because the fish would've been cooked. If the owner sees this, please make sure to ask your workers to package the raw fish in a separate bag from hot food.   I can't wait to come back and try one of the authentic Chinese dishes!",

When we sat down there was only one other diner, though a few more tables trickled in throughout our lunch. We normally don't order sushi from Chinese restaurants but were told it is really good. We also order potstickers. The spicy tuna and shrimp tempura were decent, but the godfather roll was made with a freshly fried shrimp so it made the whole roll and avocado on top hot and mushy. Taste-wise it was alright, though. The potstickers brown sauce was far too sour and borderline inedible. We might go back but we'll stick with the Chinese dishes instead.",

I've been on a dim sum kick lately and I decided to give this place a look since it's closer than the places I typically go for similar food. I ordered dan dan noodles and even though I was told this place made their own noodles, you could tell these were boxed spaghetti noodles. Also, the handmade dumplings are not soup dumplings. They aren't bad though. We ordered the scallion pancake and potstickers, and they were both so greasy, we almost could not finish it. My friend got the braised beef noodle soup and it was extremely spicy and she had trouble finishing it. If you're looking for authentic Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area, there are better places you can go. I'm sure the Americanized Chinese food, like the General Tso's chicken might be better. But I'll never know, because I'll never come back here. Added star for the clean and sleek decor and helpful and polite staff.",

I would highly recommend them if you want to experience True Chinese cuisine in the Greater Pittsburgh area.   I have to admit I'm addicted to their seafood hot and sour soup. It's just brilliant! All the seafood is fresh; the spice level is just where it needs to be with that hot yet savory heat. I have been living in Mt Lebo for four years and I've never had a bad meal here.   Other recommendations: #1 fave: Seafood Hot and Sour soup!  Steamed Dumplings Mala Crispy style (spicy! But worth the heat!)  Seafood Clay Pot   It can get a bit busy on the weeknights and weekends, but that's a good thing. The parking on street is limited, so prepare to circle around the block or use the garage. If everyone wants to be here, then you know the food is super worth the wait.   Out of five stars:  Food: five stars!  Atmosphere: five stars!! Service: five stars!",

    "text": "Visited my friends in Pittsburgh. We ordered in after a long day, and I was happily surprised by everything. We got a ton of food and all of it was so good! My favorite was the Thai fried rice, which we paired with the sesame chicken. So, so good. My friend got Pad Thai and her bf got chicken fried rice, and they both enjoyed. The portions were very generous and enough to feed us a few times over. The sushi was also pretty good. Happy with the meal overall, my only complaint is that it took a good 30 min longer than the expected time. Would definitely eat again, but maybe do takeout or dine in.",

It was excessively dark, which frankly I don't appreciate; I like to see my food. The waitress was pleasant, but when I had a problem with the bill she seemed clueless and said she didn't know how to ask the management/chefs to fix it since they really didn't speak English. They advertised $5 small plate appetizers during happy hour but I was inexplicably charged full price for one. The food was tasty, but it would have been more enjoyable if it didn't all look gray in the dim light.",

The warm avocado matched with crabmeat and the pop of caviar.  Absolutely fantastic!  I love the purple rice rolls as well.  The Harumi Roll (Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, cucumber, tamago) is a personal favorite.   I typically sit at the bar area for dinner and the service has always been great!  There is plenty of room in the restaurant area to host a large dinner.   My favorite Dinner selections are the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, I ask for it with minced pork.  The Gung Bao Style Shrimp is fantastic as well.  Its very spicy but you are able to request less heat if needed.   I am able to get a few meals out of the size of the portions of the dinners or you could share!   The cold cucumbers are also delicious, there really isn't anything on the menu that I wouldn't order.",

    "text": "It was a Saturday afternoon and my insatiable craving for sushi had struck again. Since my boyfriend and I were going to be in the Mt. Lebanon area, the Jade Grill was our choice. We've never been here before, but we love visiting new places!  We decided to treat ourselves and get a couple drinks before our meal. My boyfriend got a peach bourbon mule that was delicious. I got a mojito, and I was disappointed at first because it just tasted like sugary mint water. When the waitress came to our table, I told her about my drink being weak and she quickly and happily liquored it up.  For our meals, I got a Philly roll (my favorite), a tuna roll, and a Jade roll (sweet potato tempura topped with seaweed salad and avocado). My boyfriend got a beef, chicken, and asparagus platter that was still sizzling when it arrived. Everything was delicious, and I'm a stickler about good sushi! I usually don't deviate from rolls with no seafood in them, but the Jade roll was amazing. My sushi craving has been satisfied for now, but I would not mind visiting the Jade Grill again!",

So I asked for a salad with fish or chicken whatever was quick. Since most of my party had eaten and were now waiting for me  she came back with a side salad. At this point I was so angry and Hungry I just asked for the check. Which she promptly delivered and they charged me for the side salad. I NEVER do reviews but this place truly Sucks!!!",

Didn't serve great portions to the choice of Sichuan style dry pot that we ordered. In fact there were 5 times more other stuff than chunks of chicken, which serves as the meat element of the main dish.  Size and stomach-stuffing ability is generally not great, excluding sushi, which is sadly about the same everywhere. Sushi was decent, but not as excellent as the price tag would justify, at least for some of the selections. Overall selection of food category is great, very comprehensive. Food is on average 3.5 out of 5 authentic to the corresponding Chinese provincial styles, which is already somewhat of a rare bird in the Pittsburgh area.  In conclusion, try it out for yourself to see if the price+atmosphere justifies the satisfaction. Approximate spending per capita is 30 for first-timers.   PS, parking is a huge hassle.",

We had long green pepper pork and a garlic basil calamari for main courses with fresh spring rolls and spicy cucumber for appetizers.  The spring rolls were exactly as hoped for and the cucumber refreshing.  The two main courses were very pleasing.  We like spicy food and the long green pepper pork had a great kick. The calamari was full of flavor as well.  The next time we will sit at the bar and get to know Andy a bit more.  Highly recommended.",

My wife had Honey Walnut Chicken and I had the hot plate beef; both were flavorful and extremely well presented.  We had a new server and it was evident that she was well-trained on the menu items.  The menu is pretty interesting and includes traditional fare.  As I understand it, the Sushi Chef is one of the owners and their sushi is pretty good.  We don't do sushi but a couple people who eat it have told me theirs is great also.  You won't get Sweet and sour chicken or pork here but you will get great food and service.",

They even have a separate authentic and American Chinese menu in english to suit all taste buds. They also have unpublished Chinese specials only upon request and sometimes its written in Chinese on the board. The servers  has always been attentive and pleasant. The Handmade steam dumpling is to die for and my favourite. The Lamb soup especially in colder weather hits all the spots. Seafood Tofu Claypot is all fresh and in very generous. The duck is well flavoured and a good alternative to the boring chicken, beef, pork you can find anywhere. The sushi is also very good and generous with their portions and the expensive ingredients. I have eaten in Jade Grille 5 times now and love it. If only my husband can take spicy food, I would love to try the rich variety of spicy food in their menu.",

    "text": "The dumplings were amazing, but nothing else I ordered seemed too special. The food was fine, I just expected more for the price and after having the stellar dumplings as an appetizer. The service is what I found lacking. For some reason, the hostess took our main course order, which is fine, but my order was incorrect. (I ordered an entree and was brought out a 1/2 cup bowl of soup) No big deal, I was fine to wait another 10 minutes for my food, but I was shocked that not one of the 4 people that interacted with me about the mishap ever offered any sort of apology (Not the waitress, the hostess, the food busser, or the other person that came out from the kitchen to double check that they got it right the second time, in fact I kinda felt like they tried to convince me that I messed up and I DID actually order a teeny bowl of soup for my entree.) Usually when an order gets screwed up, a good restaurant wont charge you for that item, or they will take one of your drinks off the bill. Not only did that not happen, I wasn't even given a simple apology, so I think they need to work on their customer service standards. Oh, and also, we overheard one waitress say to another \"Im gonna kill someone\" as she was walking away from another table. I understand working in the service industry can make you want to kill people, but really, save that talk for the kitchen.",

On Friday, we drove to Mt. Lebanon Washington Rd and arrived around 5 o'clock when i was pretty hungry at that moment. The environment and decoration there is pretty nice and clean. My friend said the beef noodle soup is her favorite. Then we ordered the noodle soup, sushi, tofu and \"Basil and garlic style Chicken\"(my favorite dish there). I stayed in China for a year before because of my business. I have to say Jade Grille has the real Chinese food and closet Chinese taste compare to other unprofessional Chinese restaurants. The materials they utilized are super fresh, you can tell from the salmon in the sushi. All in all, i was impressed by the food and the nice service!  Definitely will recommend to all the skeptical foodie and hope you will enjoy eating there as i do :)",

    "text": "This was my favorite Chinese restaurant but the past few times I've received delivery orders, the food has been drastically different from what is served in the restaurant. The food in received las night was pre-made frozen food where as the food in the restaurant is freshly made. It is terrible that a restaurant would change the quality and freshness of their food specifically for take out and delivery orders and charge the same price. I have attached the pictures of what mala style chicken looks like when you order when you actually eat there verse what you get for delivery. I have also noticed this with the general Tso's.   The delivery is in the bowl looks like what you get at a cheap buffet and th second is what is served in the restaurant. EXTREMELY DIFFERENT ESPECIALLY IN QUALITY!!!!!  Post response: that is what mala style looked looked like with being triple fried and was much smaller pieces. I have been going to the restaurant for 4 years and the mala crispy style has never looked like some garbage of a 7$ buffet like I received last night and a few times before. But it always seems to be COMPLETELY different then when it is ordered in the restaurant. You completely failed to address that. If you supposed triple fry what you gave me last night then batter wild have been much darker and the chicken completely dry.",

When we call the restaurant they claim that we are lying. One time (over a year ago) I drove all the way to the restaurant after receiving my delivery to show the manager how the plastic melted. Soup went everywhere. He gave me a couple free soups and apologized for not believing me. But I did not think that was appropriate reimbursement/compensation for the situation at hand, given that he accused me of lying, and I had to drive all the way to the restaurant to prove that their delivery was poor.  Today, it happened again. They are very defensive on the phone as if we are somehow at fault? We purchased extra sauce on the side, which they charged us for; however they clearly put hardly any sauce with the dish and minimal sauce on the side.. very disappointing. They also did not deliver sauce that we paid for.  The chicken was extremely dry. The fried rice lacked flavor. We will never order from here again.",

The service was excellent. We received our chilled bottle of wine right away and our sushi was prepared in perfect timing. I had the spicy salmon roll and shrimp tempura roll while my friend had tuna roll, lobster tempura roll and shrimp tempura roll. We also had crab Rangoon for an appetizer.   I have been to Japan and the sushi here is probably the best I ever had in the states. It is mouth watering. Originally I used yelp reviews to lead me here and they were right!

I also ordered the pan fried noodles with beef and it was superb. I'm so glad I saw that billboard which made me crave Chinese food.

The only downside to picking up take out from here is the lack of street parking in the area. I parked in the top level of the garage that is about two blocks down the street from the restaurant. Thankfully my order was ready to be picked up when I got there because it was a typical cold winter day in Pittsburgh and I was ready to get inside to enjoy the food.  Even though I've never had a sit down meal here, I did want to mention how beautiful the inside of the restuarant is. I will be back to try a sit down meal in the near future!",

    "text": "A great place to stop for dinner and/or drinks! The food ranges from Chinese, to Japanese, to a few Thai dishes. Within their Chinese menu, they've got the more common American-style dishes to much less often seen Xinjiang noodles.   We stopped by to have a drink and some snacks, so we got the Dan dan noodles and Sichuan wings. After seeing their range of drinks (cocktails, sake, soju, beer, wine), we started off with a house soju and a Beijing Bellini. The soju was definitely a plain soju, so depending on your tastes, something more flavored may be preferable. The Bellini was really nice and refreshing, pretty much just a lychee flavored Bellini.  The food came out and the noodles were a good size dish for sharing. With Dan dan noodles, I prefer more spice and oil than they had (and maybe some pickled vegetables), but it still had good flavor. The noodles used for this dish also appeared to be closer to Italian spaghetti than the traditional noodles, but not too bad of a difference. The wings were small but had really nice flavor! And the quantity of wings still made the price seem worth it. I saw their list of imported beers and couldn't resist ordering a Tsingtao to go with the wings. A great combo!   The service was friendly and quick and the bar had a nice atmosphere as well. Some big screens on the wall so we were able to get a sports fix during our meal as well.   Would love to try their authentic Chinese menu next time I visit. Looking forward to it!",

The fried rice was not what we were expecting. It did not have that nice coconut milk thai curry taste. It seemed like there was too much curry powder in it. The garlic shrimp was also unimpressive. The sauce had a weird consistency and was too sweet. Overall, I would come back to have their sushi but their food was unimpressive.

The wonton soup is actually pretty gross too, bland and soggy. Delivery was about an hour, which was expected.   When I heard that Jade Grille delivered sushi I was so jazzed to try it out!  I placed my order on the phone and was quoted 45 min. However, it arrived in 20 which was great.     I ordered the specialty Avalanche Roll, a tuna avocado roll, and salmon sashimi. The sashimi was good, fresh and a larger portion than usual. The tuna avocado roll was also good, pretty standard tho nothing special. The big disappointment was the Avalanche Roll- made with shrimp tempura and cucumber and topped with spicy tuna and sweet wasabi sauce. The shrimp was surrounded by way too much tempura breading, it was overwhelming and stale tasting.     The price was reasonable, no complaints there. I'd definitely give it another try though.",

    "text": "Jade Grille has great-tasting, authentic Szechuan dishes for reasonable prices (especially for lunch).   I've been to Jade Grille a few times and always enjoyed my experience. The restaurant itself is located in an old bank in Mt. Lebanon. While a little atypical for a restaurant, it provides a unique atmosphere and is upscale enough for a nice dinner. The service staff have always been helpful and quick, no complaints there.  The food. Part of the reason I love Jade Grille is because it doesn't just offer americanized-chinese food like General Tso's or Orange Chicken like so many other places in Pittsburgh. They have an expansive, authentic Szechuan menu to select from and the food is delicious.  Some dishes that stand out above the rest. Their Spicy Cucumber is one of my favorites. It's a lightly pickled, mildly spicy bowl of cucumbers that offer a crisp and flavorful introduction to your meal. I order them almost every time I visit. Another favorite is their Spices Chili Pot. I typically order it with chicken. It's a mix of vegetables, chicken and spices served with a side of rice. Szechuan flavors really come through on this dish and it provides a nice kick thanks to the use of Szechuan peppercorns.   I have also enjoyed their Spicy Cold Noodle and Xinjiang Cumin Spicy Noodles. Complete opposites but they go together very well. The Spicy Cold Noodle is a chilled and tossed with a spicy, chili oil that, while messy, offers a nice balance to the cold noodles. The Xinjiang Noodles are spicy and come with a ground meat (either Lamb or Beef) mixed in. While I really enjoy the flavors from both of these dishes, the noodles they use are not the best. It looks and tastes very similar to spaghetti pasta and doesn't offer much in terms of flavor or texture. That being said, the other flavors throughout the dish overshadow the lackluster noodles and keep me coming back for more.  Portion sizes here are generous. I've never been able to finish my entree and have always had food to take home. This makes the higher dinner price point easier to understand. The quality of the food and portion sizer worth paying a little extra for. Speaking of price, go for lunch! They serve the same menu and offer a free salad with their lunch specials and you can get dishes such as the Chili Hot Pot (normally around $15) for only $8. It's a steal!  They also offer takeout and a full service bar. I have ordered take-out once or twice and found it to be just as good as ordering in the restaurant.   TLDR: Great authentic Szechuan cuisine, go for lunch, order Spices Chili Pot and Spicy Cucumber.",

    "text": "I would try Jade Grille again, just for the Pad Thai.  There were only two other tables seated when we walked in at 6:15ish.  The place looks great, but the servers aren't well trained and the hostess looked like she wanted to be anywhere else.  We were seated and given menus that weren't the same.  Got two \"updated menus\" after asking which one was the right one to be using.  Ordered food.  Asked that my two small plates be served with my husband's dinner. Got my Szechuan Spring Roll in like 5 minutes.  It was hot, and crunchy, that's it.  No flavor, no nothing, even with the duck sauce.  The other small plate I ordered came with my husband's Pad Thai. The Ocean Roll was described as cucumber, tuna, and salmon wrapped in cucumber. What I was served was faux crab, avocado, tuna and salmon wrapped in cucumber.  I do not like the first two things I just listed, and had they been in the description, I would not have ordered the dish. They did make me a new order with just the cucumber, tuna and salmon, which was good.  The highlight of the meal though was the Pad Thai!!  We ended up sharing the Pad Thai.  When the bill came, the amount we were charged was different from the menu price, and we were told \"Oh, I'll let them know about it.\" but the price wasn't changed on the bill.  Overall, I think they are suffering from \"new restaurant\" issues and I would be willing to go back in a few months and give them an other try.",

I had read positive reviews about their dumplings so wanted to try them for myself.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  When you bit in to them or cut them a soupy substance leaked through...perhaps they're meant to be that way but the texture didn't sit well with me.  I also thought the soy ginger sauce they provided with the dumplings was too vinegary.  For my main entree, I ordered the Garlic Basil Wok with Chicken and brown rice.  This dish was very flavorful and there was plenty of chicken morsels (not too big) that were tender and fresh.  You could see garlic gloves and basil leaves throughout the dish.  My only wish for the dish would have been to have some veggies - but it didn't mention that the dish had veggies, so I can't really be upset about that.    My friend had the avocado lobster salad small plate and said it was great and tried the fried rice and was equally satisfied.    I'll definitely be back again to check out their other options.  The decor is very modern and the restaurant itself seems quite spacious.  Love the bank door for the private room.",

Friends of ours had recommended that we try the handmade dumplings, so we ordered those and the Szechuan dumplings. They are very different from each other! The Szechuan dumplings were like boiled potstickers that were in a garlic soy sauce, and though very garlicky, they were still good. The handmade steamed dumplings were fabulous! Be sure to get some extra fresh ginger right alongside those yummy pockets of goodness.  The next course was my staple order of a shrimp tempura roll and an Alaskan roll, just so I could compare in my sushi competition of life. Very good, though Jade Grill will not take a place in my top three. If I had to rate them for anything, it would be the dumplings. They were very notable.   The service was wonderful, but again, we were the only ones there. Our waitress was extremely knowledgable. She shared some chef secrets and helped to debunk a question about shrimp tails.   They have a great wine and liquor selection, and several craft beers on tap. I hope they get more busines, as I think there is great potential here.",

I have only had sushi one other time since living in Pitts and it was yucky.  Jade grille will be new sushi spot for now on.  It was delicious!  The bartender told us they get fresh fish delivered from Wholey's daily, other than Sunday's.   We ordered a smorgasbord of different small plates and sushi.   The tuna pistachio and Avalanche roll were my favorite.  The roll had a wonderful sweet wasabi sauce drizzled on top.  We chose to sit at the bar. It's a huge granite bar with four tvs and a sushi bar.  For happy hour you get buy one get one half off of sushi rolls.  Pretty good deal especially for the specialty rolls.  I cannot wait to go back!",

I haven't trie other styles of food so I cannot comment with that. But the design of the restaurant itself is so decent and the idea of opening up that bar area is actually nice. A word of advice would be to start serving cold dishes at the bar for the beer. In general this restaurant is fantastic especially for those enjoying Chinese style hot/spicy food!",

Jade Grill has brought Authentic Chinese Dishes to Pittsburgh.  You won't fine General Tso or Hunan Beef...what you will find is appetizers such as Pickled Vegetables, Lamb & Chicken Skewers, Hand Made (at time of order) Steamed Dumplings and much more.  For meals, you can choose from Soups that include 40 feet of hand pulled noodles (and if you don't believe it, ask to watch), Entrees that can include, Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Shrimp or Seafood.  And so much more.  I opted for the Dry Pot...This was so amazing...it was full of a mix of flavors and then the heat...oh the heat.  Not for the faint of heart but I have to tell you, the burn does go away and you are left with the need to go back in for more.  Part of me doesn't want to expose this incredible gem hidden on RT 19, but the reality is that I want everyone to go away with satisfaction that I have right now....and I am already planning my next visit.  Thank you so much Jade Grill for opening my eyes to \"real\" Chinese cuisine.",

I believe it was spicy tuna w salmon on top. Good but too much texture for my taste. It was my boyfriends pick.   For dinner I had the kabob salad. Very nice size but the menu said it came with feta cheese and it had blue cheese on it. I'm not a huge blue cheese fan but it was still good.   My boyfriend got the spicy beef and peppers. The beef was a little gristly and it had a ginger flavor that was a bit overpowering.   Overall I would return again. I'd like to try a chicken dish. The presentations and portions sizes were good. I would have rated the restaurant a 3 and a half but couldn't figure out how to do a half star. Not bad to try if you are in the area.",

The frog legs were great!  The spices chili pot preparation was spicey, too spicey for me, but the taste made it so worth it.  I'll be ordering this preparation again but with veggies, beef, or shrimp for my next round.  The cumin style and the lamb were both great and a good pairing that I'll have again.

    "text": "A friend came to visit from out of town and we decided to explore Washington Rd. together. Jade Grille was a place I had been wanting to try, especially because I was intrigued by the idea of eating more traditional, authentic Chinese cuisine. My friend wanted sushi, and so we felt this was the best of both worlds because we could try a little of everything.  We first ordered a small plate of the Handmade Steamed Dumplings, which were just a little bit bigger then a silver dollar. The six dumplings arrived nestled in a steam basket, and we enjoyed the presentation. They were delicious, but as a first taste, I didn't find them terribly exotic, just solidly good.  The second item we ordered was the Sashimi Ceviche, at my insistence, since I'd heard great things about it. This dish blew our tastebuds out of the water, and my mouth is salivating just thinking about it again. It's built like a salad, with large chunks of raw tuna, salmon and yellowtail tossed with chopped red onions, sweet jalapenos, cilantro and chunks of cherry tomatoes in a lime juice and ponzu soy sauce dressing. Ponzu is a citrus-based sauce made with rice wine, rice vinegar, bonito fish flakes, and seaweed, and then I suspect Jade Grille tosses in a bit of soy sauce to make it richer. The ceviche was bright and fresh. The sashimi pieces were buttery and we ended up pouring the remainder of the dressing on our plates to soak up as much of the flavors as possible.  For our third course we had decided to split the Spicy Chili Pot with Chicken, a \"traditional Chinese herb and spices sauce with black mushrooms, bamboo, celery, bell pepper, onion and Sichuan peppercorns.\" It was a smart decision on our part, because the serving that arrived with a side of white rice fed both of us with enough leftover for another lunch and dinner. Our first bite made our eyes bug out slightly, because the dish was *genuinely* hot! The vegetables were crunchy and the flavor was rich and very well-made. We both like spicy foods, so it was a good heat that made us happy.  Lastly, we ordered three sushi rolls - an eel avocado roll, a spicy tuna roll and one of their specialty rolls, the Samurai Roll. First off, let me say that just like the ceviche, all three rolls were very high quality. They were slightly cooler than room temperature and very fresh and for someone who suffers with grocery store sushi far too often, it was a delight to experience the real deal. We found that the best roll was actually the spicy tuna, mainly in terms of flavor. The samurai roll was delicious but very mild, almost to the point of blandness, and needed to be dipped in soy sauce to get the full flavor impact. But the texture was great and the black tobiko, which are egg roe, created a lovely sensation when they bumped across our tongues.  All in all, this was a spectacular dinner. We almost rolled home we were so full, and everything was very well made, well presented, and of a high quality. I nabbed a menu on my way out of the door, because what really surprised me about this high-end Chinese restaurant is that they deliver!",

    "text": "First off, they won't honor a Yelp certificate for delivery... which doesn't make sense and isn't listed as a restriction. In fact, Yelp even said that the store can't add that restriction at the time of redemption. Needlesstosay, Yelp refunded the money.   Albeit frustrated, I gave this place a try on another night during my work trip this week.   Long story short- they don't know what kimchi sauce is. Their ponzu is DEFINITELY not ponzu. Their salmon roll smells atrocious and can't possibly be fresh (literally smelled of rotting fish). Their handmade dumplings were loaded with some watery liquid that appears to be a result of freezing them. Their hot and sour soup was pure salt, and they didn't put any chopsticks in my to-go order... so I had to use my fingers in my hotel room.   There's had got to be a better sushi place around here... don't waste your time if you want a fresh, True, and safe-bet.",

Nice bar too, although the bartenders can be a bit clueless about how to mix the most basic of drinks, which is a little confusing. The sushi isn't as good as what you can get down the street at Little Tokyo, but some of the specialty rolls are fun and tasty.",

My brother and I split a little plate of  sliced beef Sichuan style and the more we ate the more we wanted.   For the main lunch I had chongqing spicy chicken.  Imagine crispy chicken skin with spicy Chinese spices. Couldn't stop eating it!  My brother had the spices hot pot with chicken.  The chicken was so tender, the veggies compliment and took on the flavor of the sauce and didn't overpower the food the way that some veggies can (especially carrots)  Lunches came with rice and soup which were both excellent.  Took back a braised chicken noodle soup and reports were also very positive   Price might seem a bit high but it was worth it for the quality.   Lunch crowd was surprisingly small. Don't let that dissuade you if you come for lunch.   Can't wait to go back. Might even go tomorrow with a coworker!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with a few friends a couple nights ago (used the $10 for $20 deal here on Yelp!). We started with the sashimi platter (4 pieces of 5 (?) fish - we got salmon, tuna, sea bass, yellowtail, and white tuna) which was really good, especially by Pittsburgh standards. Buttery, thick slices of seemingly fresh fish :) Everyone also really enjoyed their meals - I got the red curry, which was amazing, and, after eating (more than) my fill, the leftovers lasted me another two meals.   Others got the mapao tofu, red curry (again), and a spicy chicken pot thing (not sure of the exact name, sorry!) - everyone loved their meals. We split a couple bottles of the house unfiltered sake, which was also pretty delicious and went down really easily. Definitely a little pricier than standard Chinese fare, but I'd say it was definitely worth it for the size and quality!",

Favorites include the crispy mala tofu, Chinese long peppers with beef or pork, and the handmade soup dumplings and pot stickers.  Definitely gravitate toward the authentic Chinese menu.  Service is always friendly and efficient.  Steer clear of the sushi--husband was reminded why he only eats sushi at Japanese places after reading a review and trying the sushi here.  Nothing horrible, just not the greatest.  Stick with the Chinese menu, which is terrific.",

The lo mein was very good, and I am hard to please in the lo mein department. The noodles were a bit thicker than what I am used to, but it was a pleasant difference... almost as if they were made from scratch. The flavor was probably better than most I have had around Pittsburgh too. The crab Rangoon was also very good... there was more of the yummy, creamy filling in it than what other places give!  I probably won't be ordering their sushi again but I definitely want to sample some more of the Chinese foods on their menu!",

We found this place interesting since they did offer some authentic Chinese food so we decided to check it out.   The establishment is well decorated and has a good atmosphere. As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by the hostess. She sat us on a small table for two and gave us a menu in Chinese. (We can't read Chinese). So we asked for an English Menu. We were craving for duck so we got their braised duck and a dish of eggplant. We waited for about 45 minutes before our meal came, which we can understand if they are preparing the duck fresh but that's still a long time.  When the dishes came, the dishes did not fit on the tiny table (there were plenty of other bigger tables opened when we came in). So we had to move everything to a bigger table.  To our disappointment,  the duck had parts that were extremely burned to the point that you couldn't even bite it. Keep in mind that the portion was extremely little for half a duck (It must have been a duckling). The eggplant was too flavorful for me and definitely not worth the price that they charge. I was not happy with the food at all and will never go back.",
