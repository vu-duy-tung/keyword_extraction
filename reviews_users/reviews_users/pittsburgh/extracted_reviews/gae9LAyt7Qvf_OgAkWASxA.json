    "text": "Bucca Di Beppo is an Italian chain restaurant specializing in huge portions of mediocre food, with goofy, but likeable decorations thrown around inside.  There is a whole group of diners that believes quantity trumps quality and this chain is custom designed for them. Food is served family style; small orders usually feed 2+ average people and large up to 4. Many people feel you are getting a great value here, but personally I see lots of very CHEAP pasta being served and you are paying through the nose for it.  The pizza's are thin crust and rectangular and did not look very appetizing due to the toppings being slung on it haphazardly and one side was a little burnt, a frozen Frescheta is better than what we were served. The chicken carbonara is nothing like a regular Carbonara, it is served with Alfredo sauce instead the egg thickened cream sauce.   I can go on and on, a lot of the entrees are pasta, red sauce and cheese, pretty common American Italian fare, nothing exciting. Now was the food inedible or bad - NO, but to be honest The Olive Garden which would get three stars if I ever choose to review it. Quite frankly Olive Garden, has better and more authentic (hard to believe but it's True) food.  Like I said earlier I can see this as a popular place with a certain crowd of diners, it serves it purpose and will continue to be successful, to be absolutely honest, I wanted to like it more than I did. It was a fun atmosphere and I like the concept, but I would much rather pay $14 for an entree, finish it all and be wowed, than pay $16 for a mediocre pile of food and have mediocre leftovers for the next 2 days.",

    "text": "So I'm reading the previous reviews... and Buca di Beppo is a little gem?! I'm not sure I agree with that. First of all, it's not little. Secondly, it's a pretty decently known chain restaurant, so it wouldn't really be a gem in the sense that it is something to be discovered. Either way, this chain does have its value.   Buca has become a regular place for celebratory dinners with my co-workers. We've been here a few times, but only on weekdays when it is pretty empty and easy to get a big table. The prices are pretty fair for a big group, especially after you split the meal, the drinks, and the check. The family style meal is also really fun for a big group. I like that it is a casual restaurant that allows for a dinner group to be loud and rowdy.   As for the food, you can definitely find better and more unique Italian food at other restaurants. At Buca, the food is just mass produced on big plates so that everyone can eat like a family. Everything I've ever tried is good enough.   Oh, and definitely get the sangria... it adds to the fun night for sure, plus it's tasty.",

I have consulted yelp on many occasions but only now felt a need to forewarn my fellow diners: Avoid this place. We ordered a salad which was the only passable substance that was placed on our table.  The pasta marinara was overcooked cheap pasta with something like undrained pureed tomatoes for sauce.  It was literally floating in half a bowl of water.  We also ordered Chicken Marsala which came in a sauce that tasted like something between molasses and maple syrup.  That might fly on bacon or breakfast sausage but chicken and mushrooms?  Yikes.  The only high point was a reduction of about 90% on the bill after complaining.  Five stars to our waiter, he definitely did all he could to please us.",

It's made to look like your Italian-American grandmother's house, with pictures and knick knacks all over the wall a la Applebee's.  There are family characters and witty sayings all over the (huge) menu.  That's all well and good, but the food is nothing special.  We shared calamari (warning: they serve the rings AND the tentacles.  Don't order this if you're tentacle squeamish.) and the big pasta sampler of all their baked specialties--the stuffed shells were pretty good, lot of fennel and sausage, but other than that I just didn't get any big flavors from the meal.  Honestly, the advertisements for Italian supermarket brands (cheese, sauce, etc.) in the menu made me wish that I had cooked an Italian meal for myself at home because quite frankly, I can do better than Buca.",

Having been told that it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait, 30 minutes later we where still sitting around, twiddling our thumbs. We were then told that some other party of three had taken our spot. When we finally got seated we then sat for another 15 minutes before a waiter came over. He did at least apologise and said he thought another waiter was taking care of us. We stopped him mid welcoming speech and ordered a large pizza, that was supposed to feed four or more. The three of us finished it quickly and were still hungry. The toppings were sparse and totally missing on some pieces.  I would not come back here.",

First the food!:  - We ordered the Mixed Green Salad with fresh lettuce blend tossed with the signature Italian vinaigrette, red onions, pepperoncini peppers and black and green olives.* *Spice up your salad with prosciutto and Gorgonzola cheese. Terrific!   -We split the Chick en Cannelloni Pasta tubes stuffed with chicken, spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses with a hint of lemon zest and nutmeg, baked on a bed of rosa sauce. Delicious!! Couldn't get enough.   The meal came with bread and butter.   -Definintely great food this visit.  We will be back to try other dishes.  Second, the annoying parts:  - Went on a Saturday evening and with no wait time at all, we were directed to a booth up on the third floor (the hostess was kind enough to point out the restrooms on the second floor through the kitchen because I'd never have guessed). Once we sat on the seat we realized this was a broken seat and moved over to a booth that was a bit more comfortable. They need to go over the dinning areas and spruce up the seating and some of the little details of comfort. Third floor was loud and noisy with everyone trying to hear and talk over the other customers (ugg!). -our waiter was a 'just there' good old boy.  Nice, but not at all attentive nor did he really understand wine ordering.  We did not get any water, and we had ordered a 9 oz. craft of wine and had to wait until we were half done eating to get a 'Bottle' of wine!.  We told him we didn't order a bottle but a craft and I watched from my seat while he poured the whole bottle into a huge glass craft which was not even on the menu!  By now we had completed over half of our meal and were dying of thirst so we simply poured out 2 glasses of wine and had him take back the rest.   Overall we enjoyed the meal and will go back but try for a different spot to eat, and make sure we point to the menu for everything we are ordering, and ask for water First Thing!~",

    "text": "I am NOT a restaurant snob.  In general I think Buca is great, with decent food, big portions, and a fun atmosphere to hang out with friends.  But the service at this particular location was pretty bad.  We stopped by to get lunch before a Pirates game, but the place was packed and the line was really long.  We tried again for dinner after the game, and again the wait was very long.  We only got a table right away by being one of the few groups willing to sit on the patio after a very hot day out in the sun.  Our pitcher of sangria came pretty quickly, but we had to spend a good ten minutes staring at it longingly before we got any glasses we could use to actually drink it.  We never got any bread, which I'm pretty sure they automatically serve to every table, right?  None of our drinks were ever refilled (not even the water, which sort of sucked; see above about spending the previous 4 hours in bleacher seats in direct sun).  Our food came after a pretty long wait, and was typical Buca food- tasty by my standards, anyway!  We ordered dessert, but our brownie sundae had no brownies.  That was a pretty big letdown, let me tell you.  Mostly I felt bad for the servers.  It's not like they were just standing around while we waited for food, they were constantly running back and forth and looked really stressed.  There was a big group at the table next to us (a bachelorette party, I think) and they didn't get several of their dishes until well after everyone else at their table had finished eating.  Understandably they sent them back.  Between running to serve all of her tables and trying to apologize to this angry group about a problem that wasn't even her fault, their poor waitress was in tears by the time we left.  From my experience and other reviews, it seems like they are chronically understaffed.  It is a very busy location in a very popular area, and it sounds like the management has not gotten that memo.  The end result is that the customers end up entertaining themselves while they wait for their food by chatting with the other tables about how bad the service is.  That WAS at least entertaining, but not exactly the reason I stopped by.",

We ate here the night before running the Pittsburgh half marathon.  The place was busy, but there were a few empty tables around us.  Our waitress took at least 20 minutes to do everything.  Twenty minutes before our order was taken, 20 more minutes before we got our drinks.  Half an hour to bring us dessert, and yet another 20 minutes to get our check, and almost half an hour to take our credit card.  We were at the table for over 2.5 hours.  She was almost never in the room, so we're not sure what she was doing, but it was some of the worst service we've had in quite some time.",

Looking for a place to eat in Pittsburgh and the hotel staff at the Hilton directed our group of teachers (from Maryland) here and supplied the free shuttle from the hotel.  The atmosphere was nice (though the table next to ours was a bit loud).  Food was excellent and huge portions, even though we ordered off the single-serve menu, rather than the family style, because we had to have itemized receipts for our expense accounts.  I got eggplant parmigiana and it was the best I've ever had. I couldn't even eat the spaghetti that came with it as the serving was huge!  Other diners in the group were pleased with their choices as well.  We shared an appetizer sampler that consisted of calamari, shrimps, and mozzarella.  I didn't taste the cheese, but the rest was quite good.  Our server was excellent and attended to every detail.  When faced with the task of five separate bills and the complications that go along with that, she smiled and treated us like celebrities. This is the funny part--the walls of Buca di Beppo are plastered with pictures of all sizes and shapes.  At first, nothing seems out of the ordinary.  But on closer examination, some pictures reveal strange little inconsistencies that cause one to do a double-take.  For example, Mona Lisa topless!  Needless to say, we had quite a few laughs over these.  My personal favorite was a little Easter Bunny--or so it appeared on first glance.  I'll leave the rest up to you... Go and enjoy.",

    "text": "I've been to several Buca di Beppo restaurants in Maryland before coming to this one. Each time, I've become less impressed with their food. Yes, they serve massive portions, intending to follow their mission of serving family-style meals and thus contributing to the obesity epidemic in the United States. However, the quality of their food is mediocre at best. As the saying goes, \"Quality over quantity (unless the quantity of your meal is the size of a golf ball).\"  So, my friend and I came here for lunch. It was the middle of the week, so we did not expect there to be too much going on. We entered the restaurant and told the hostess that we'd like a table for two. To our surprise, she said there would be a 15-minute wait. I looked around and there were quite a few empty booths. I thought maybe they were short-staffed...but my friend and I decided to look at the menu while we waited. There was another group who came in after us who had made reservations, so they were promptly led to their seats. I started thinking maybe we should have made reservations, but the hostess interrupted my train of thought by telling us that our table is ready. She led us to the third floor, past several empty booths and tables, and showed us to our booth.  Before ordering our food, we had use the restroom. Inside the men's restroom, we discovered a number of very interesting pictures. Of children. Showing their naked butts.  ...  So after a good laugh, we made it to our booth and perused the menu. My being a vegetarian, and my friend wanting to do everything he can to accommodate me, we took a bit longer than expected to decide what to order. Our waitress came by two or three times to ask if we decided. I felt so sorry for her because we kept being hesitant and making last minute changes, especially after realizing that pasta does NOT come with the eggplant parmigiana (honestly, who doesn't eat _____ parmigiana WITHOUT pasta?!). Eventually, we decided on the food. I ordered a white sangria and a large Pizza con Formaggio; my friend ordered the eggplant parmigiana with an extra side order of spaghetti marinara.  After 5 minutes, my white sangria came, which was very good! About 10 minutes later, our pizza came. Our waitress placed the pizza board on top of two \"pizza cans\" that serve to elevate the pizza to make room for the eggplant parmigiana and the spaghetti marinara. After attempting to slice the pizza, we banished the pizza cans to the side of the table and laid the pizza board on the table, which made it a lot easier to cut and serve.  The pizza was cheesy, saucy, and good. I felt it didn't have much flavor besides the cheese and tomato sauce. I did my best to search for the \"garlic-infused oil\" flavor that the menu clearly stated, but my tongue could not detect it.  The eggplant parmigiana was okay. There was more fried batter and cheese than eggplant, however. I felt like I was chewing into a thick and slightly wet cheesy tempura. I looked inside and found the thinnest slice of eggplant ever. I thought the eggplant was supposed to be the star of a dish called eggplant parmigiana...?  Overall, the highlight of my meal was the white sangria (not that I'm an alcoholic, mind you). The food was not authentic, the portion sizes were a bit much (I'm sure some people may like that), and the quality of the food was mediocre at best. If you're looking to gorge yourself on Americanized Italian food, this is the place to go! If you want to treat yourself to an authentic Italian meal, steer clear of this chain restaurant. While I haven't been to many Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, I know there are places that serve authentic Italian cuisine somewhere in the city.",

The salad was a big bowl of lettuce and red onions, eggplant parm was over cooked and could not be eaten, shrimp fra diavolo was so spicy we couldn't eat and the pasta was undercooked.

The restaurant was very run down, a bit dirty, and smelled unpleasant inside. It also seemed a bit like a stuffy, dark basement with a lot of junk on the walls (yes I know this is supposed to be part of the theme). The food is served as large portions meant to be shared, and might be an ok deal for larger groups, but it was not a good deal for 2. We ended up spending almost $90 for one shared pasta dish, one shared salad, and two large beers. We ordered one of the pasta specials (short rib orecchiette) and it was OK, but definitely not worth the price. The server was very friendly and attentive.",

I'd describe the fare as typical mediocre, chain-type Italian-style, except that the portioning is family-style (intended to be shared between 2-6 others).  The first time, I had the veggie lasagna, and the second time, I had the manicotti.  It's definitely filling, but not the most flavorful stuff I've ever eaten.  The meal comes with bread, and on my second trip, I ordered the cannoli, which was also solidly okay.  This is one of the less expensive options in Station Square, and it's a good place to take picky eaters (such as my folks), should you happen to be in the vicinity.  Needless to say, better-quality, more authentic Italian fare can be found elsewhere in PGH.  The decor is...interesting.  The menu explains that the name of the restaurant means \"Joe's basement,\" hence the copious bric-a-brac and lack of windows.  The bathroom is right next to the kitchen, so you can grab a peek at what's going on back there.  Service was decent on both visits.",

A better description is \"dirty tourist trap\"  Where should I begin? Let's talk about the decorations. They suck. The place looks like the home of an acid-tripping mobster diagnosed with pathological hoarding.  It also smells like a Chuck e. Cheese ball pit.  What next? Let's talk about the service. The waiter looked like she had just butchered a cow when she took our order. And no, this is not a cool organic farm to table thing, she literally was covered in bits of meat and pasta sauce. Her tie kept dragging in our food too.   Now, the food. There are a couple of reviews the point out the portions are large. I agree that they are large, but would suggest that they are large in the sense that a pig eats a large amount of food at a pig trough. And the food actually doesn't taste much better than pig slop. Actually, this is offensive to pigs.  I assume pig slop is reasonably priced, this is actually not.  The \"large\" portions are just because they fill the plates with cheap, bland, pasta.  Finally, I saw in other negative reviews that the manager kindly reached out to the reviewer and offered to fix grievances. I sincerely hope the manager does not try to contact me.  You could not pay me to go back there. The only way to fix our grievances would be to burn the place down to the ground.",

You all know the set up...family style, \"Small\" dishes serve 2-3, \"Large\" are for 4-5. For 4 of us we ordered a pasta, a meat, and a salad to start, all smalls, and well enough food.  The bread is the \"Italitan\" equivalent of Wonder Bread...soft, flavorless, no crust to speak of, but at least they bring olive oil (with a little balsamic) to dip it in,  The Caesar salad was perfectly ok.  The \"Famous\" Spaghetti and Meatballs...OK, the meatballs are quite good...really nice texture, and a good, if not exciting flavor, and the pasta was correctly cooked. But the sauce...A few squashed canned tomatoes and at least a pint of tomatoey water. No real seasoning or flavor whatsoever. It might have helped if the grated cheese was, in fact, Parmesan or Peccorino Romano, but it tasted like it was all filler...which is to say that it really didn't taste...at all.  But...  The Veal Saltimboca was, surprisingly, quite good...nicely cooked, the veal tender, the ham nicely done, and the artichokes grilled...very good, really.  I think, if I were to go there again, I would order a meat or two, and get a side order of fettuccini Alfredo, which is hard to screw up.",

The portions are very large and it's a great place for groups. This restaurant is HUGE. The decor includes over 5000 pictures of white people. No people of color on the walls however you can see some celebrities on the \"Wall of fame\" in the lobby. Noticing this fact made me very uncomfortalbe. I wont be back.",

The food was good, not great, very big portions and an overall fun experience. Went with a buddy, I think this would be more fun to bring your family to and do the family style experience. I ordered the ziti, and it came out  piping hot, which aside from the burnt lips, was good. What disappointed me was the caprese, it was really bland tasting. Overall though a place I think you'll enjoy.",

    "text": "I made reservations for 8 family members to celebrate one of our daughters' birthday, and confirmed 4 days prior, alerting the person I spoke to that it was a birthday celebration.  Called the day of the reservation to alert them again that this was a special occasion.  We were asked 4 more times while we were there if it was a special occasion. Um, yes.  We were seated in a corner with 2 tables with a space in between, rather than at a big table. Found that a bit odd, but having never been there I didn't question their seating choice for my family. I might add there weren't many others dining there at the time.  We asked our waitress about the 1.5 L house red, wanting to know if it was sweet or dry. She went to ask the bartender, came back about 10 minutes later and said it was a drier wine. Ok cool we'll take that. She brings bottle to table, already opened, and does the pour and we are fine. This bottle was $37. This will be important later.....  Rest of family filters in, and we get a mixed drink and a glass of different wine for 2 members who don't like red.  Order Caesar salad while everyone decides on the main course. Wait some more. Salad comes. We have no salad plates. Food runner has to find the waitress to tell her we need salad plates for the family style salad. Really?  We ordered the lasagna, the shrimp fra diavolo, eggplant parm, and a creamy chicken broccoli pasta. All were pretty good, except for the eggplant parm that was so tough you could not cut the rind even using a knife, or chew it sufficiently to digest it.  And our menus weren't collected until the pasta was brought out and we had to make a point to give them to the waitress. They take up a fair amount of space on the table.....  After our meals were brought out, we didn't see our waitress for another 15 minutes or so or I would have told her about the terrible eggplant. I did mention there weren't that many other people there, right? No clue where she disappeared to. So when it came time to box up the 2 pasta dishes we couldn't finish, I told her then. We were offered another eggplant dish but we were finished eating so we declined. Manager came over and apologized and said he'd take it off the bill. I asked him to go back to the kitchen and see for himself how tough it was.  Time for a dessert for birthday girl. She gets tiramisu. They bring it, sing, and we are left with a family portion of dessert and no plates or utensils! We ask for them, and waitress brings 5 forks for 8 people. Actually physically COUNTS them in front of us----leaves us with 5 forks. We don't see her again until time for check.  So I see manager took off the eggplant (which was the right thing to do), and then I see a charge for $49 for the 1.5 L wine that was supposed to be $37. SO waitress switched us to the higher priced chianti instead of giving us the red we asked for? I ask for the menu, point to the wine we were supposed to get and remind her we asked about this wine and were told it was not sweet. So while some could argue that we should have looked more closely at the label, quite frankly we were too busy talking to the 4 family members across the aisle and trying to have a good time. I expect to be able to trust that what I order is what I get.  We don't know what the manager was told about the wine but he comped the entire bottle. I didn't expect that---was perfectly willing to pay $37 for what I thought we were getting. But there were other diners around us having bad experiences as well, with manager apologizing for things, so I knew it was a bad night and I was unhappy with the way things went for what was supposed to be a nice celebration, so I took the gesture for what it was.  At the end of it, my husband and I sent the others in our party out to continue their fun while we waited -----again -----to settle up on the final check amount.  Did I tip? Yes. In cash. She got cash that no one can trace because it wasn't added on to the check I signed.  Did I give 20%----No. I fully understand a bad night for a waitress or others in the food industry. But when you are giving mediocre service and at no time is there an expression of apology for that bad service, you don't get 20% . You don't wander away for 20 minutes when the food is put on the table and not check on your customers. The eggplant wasn't her fault; not checking on us was her fault. You shouldn't have to be asked twice to put plates and utensils in front of people when it is a family style restaurant, or be asked to clear dirty dishes as the next course is being placed on the table. You should always try to make your customer happy, especially when this place is not that inexpensive.   First time to Buca. Also last time. Too many other great Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh to give Buca another chance.",

Given the overwhelming stench of mildew, moisture, and feeling of dampness, you feel like you're dining in Nona's kitschy basement dungeon/kitchen, and Nona is having issues with water and her foundation.  Seriously wtf.  I knew they used space heaters to heat the restaurant in the Winter, but something is seriously wrong and likely unsafe with thier building.  My friends wanted to stay an eat, so against my better judgement I had lunch and considered it multi tasking -- eating and inhaling toxic mold spores at the same time.  Our waitress was nice.  I ordered the Pasta Del Sol and my friend had the Chicken Parm.  I also had a wilted, yellowed caesar salad with my pasta but I didn't send it back bc I was starving and obviously down for anything (for eating there in the first place).  the pasta del sol was so so, but anything involving carbs cant be too wrong.  The chicken parm was actually VERY good, and it was a relatively inexpensive lunch.  I wont be back though, its seriously grody inside and if there are no mold issues they at least need air purifiers thruoghout.  I hope someone from Buca corporate reads this and takes action.",

The birthday song, which is a very odd but cool song and the enthusiasm from the staff made it a fun and upbeat atmosphere. Our waitress advised us to go with smalls instead of large entrees so that we wouldn't leave with as she stated \"a duffle bag of leftovers\" she could have received a larger tip with a higher check but instead had our best interest in mind and I appreciated her honesty.. the food was great so overall I would recommend buca to everyone, especially to celebrate a birthday!",

Unfortunately, the percentage of gluten free dishes on the menu is decreased, however, they do have a gluten free menu. I recommend the chicken saltimbocca. One tip- we never order sides (usually just pizza, entres, and salads) because there is so much to fill up on in terms of dishes. The atmosphere is always fun and they are great with large groups of people. My sister had her wedding rehearsal dinner there and everyone was happy.",

    "text": "Don't bother wasting your time or money going here. My boyfriend and I have been to various Bucas with no problems at all. We had just finished coming from a tour with Molly Trolleys.  We got seated in the area where the bar is at and waiter was nice. After placing our order which was a side order of spaghetti and fettuccine Alfredo with two meatballs,  we asked and decided to move to a different booth due to cold air ventilation.   Our order came out fine and as we are eating I glanced up towards the bar and to my sighting I see what I thought to be a rat run across the floor. I took a double take as I couldn't believe it and raised my voice to my boyfriend in disgust to see what actually happened to be a mouse run under the original booth we were previously sitting at.  I was so disgusted and my boyfriend and I were in shock that we stopped eating our food and didn't even finish our dinner. We stood up and told the guy at the bar if we can get our check. I quote my boyfriend told him dude I believe and think you have rats in your restaurant as we just saw one run across the floor. The bartender said and I quote \" no sir we don't have rats we only have mice\". My boyfriend and I looked at each other and at him to tell him we want our check and done.   As we are standing and waiting, the bartender came and told us that the manager would come to see us. During our waiting period to get our bill and have the manager see us, guess what?!?! We see another mouse run across the floor. At this time we are totally disgusted and done and the guy who was our waiter came out to let us know our bill has been taken care of.  My boyfriend and I are disgusted and hope not to get sick from eating here. We are also in shock that an employee  (bartender) would respond as if it's normal and ok they have mice. I believe this is a serious health issue and sanitation concern. I hope others read this review before considering eating at this disgusting and horrible establishment",

I know that every time I want to eat at Buca's, I'll have to prepare myself for the monologue from the waitress. If it involved their food specials, I'd be fine with it. Instead, I'm borderline harassed to fill out a card. No thanks. The only other issue I had was when they ran out of mozzarella.  They. Ran. Out. Of. Mozzarella.  I'm pretty sure I asked the waitress to repeat herself seeing as how mozzarella was on every single dish I wanted to order. I pressed on. I mean, it's common for an Italian restaurant to be out of a main ingredient, right? ...  Anyway, as far as the food, I'm a fan. I always order their stuffed mushroom appetizer, which could very well be an entree. Also, I make sure to share a dish with someone because there's no way one person could polish off all that pasta. (If you can and do, congrats!) I've never been disappointed with their food. I try a new dish every time I go, which isn't normal for me, but I know the menu's descriptions are accurate.  Some dishes I enjoy: Ravioli al Pomodoro, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Linguine Frutti di Mare, Gnocchi al Telefono, and Chicken Carbonara.",

All of the plates are set up family style, so be ready to share... just like at mamma house!  Our college's Italian Club came here for a night on the town.  The place was very accommodating.  We got a private room and a few servers to make sure our experience was as good as it could be.  The service was pretty good for a party of 18 on a busy Saturday night.  The waitress actually mistakenly gave us extra platters of cheesecake, but believe me we did not mind.  The food was delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was my favorite, but the meatballs were a pretty close second.  Bread with oil and salads made a great antipasta for us.  All of the pastas the place made for us were pretty good too.  I mean nothing compares to my mom and grandma's, but the food was pretty good.  Like I said, the chicken  parmesan and meatballs were really good.  The waitresses brought us some cheesecake for dessert.  Ehhhh it was alright.  We did not get to choose our desserts individually.  If we did, I probably would have went for the cannoli, but hey, the cheesecake wasnt too terrible.  My suggestion is try something else on the dessert menu.  All in all it was a great time.  One of the best atmospheres to eat dinner at if you have a big group.  So, if you are looking for a place to celebrate something with a group of people or you just wanna go indulge in massive amounts of food, come to Buca.",

Spaghetti With Meatballs-You almost don't need the pasta as their meatballs are garlic-packed asteroids of rich meatiness. They seem to have only gotten larger  and even better since my last visit.   Shrimp Fra Diavolo-This was creamy and mildly spicy with small shrimp to be found amongst the rigatoni. Yes, we were dealing with the Devil's Shrimp, but he'd have to be feelin' pretty peaceful 'n easy to indulge in this.   We also got  the Chopped Antipasto Salad with that brilliant vinaigrette and the Mozzarella Garlic Bread which I'd love to put a gooey, dripping-with-sauce meatball between two slices of.   I cannot say anything negative about the service here either.

Food was not what I am accustomed to at our local Italian place.  Very below par.  Do not get calamari, rubbery and again small portion for $10.99.  Oh yeah, the place is filthy!  Skip this one!  Better off saving a few bucks and enjoying your meal at Olive Garden!",

Both times I was there and both times, left exceedingly happy and satisfied. First, I didn't know the need to be so specific, I counted on the fact that they would probably know as it was an authentic italian restaurant but turned out not quite the case. My pasta came quite overcooked. Really saggy. I wasn't a happy camper but I thought to myself that probably was all I could get in Pittsburgh. Until the waitress asked what was wrong (I must have had an expression on my face! LOL!!) , told her and she insisted that she took it back and bring me a new portion \"al dente\" as it should have been in the first place. Then she brought me a heavenly plate of goodness. I asked for extra tomato sauce that also was generously accompanied. Linguini al dente, in red sauce with shrimps. Grated parmesan as much as you want, salt and pepper and a mixed green salad with hot pickled jalapeno peppers..I couldn't be happier. I will make very unusual comment here: the fresh pepper that is left in the grinder at your table and sea salt also in the grinder..are really exceptionally good!! So fresh, so potent flavors..Service is great. Portions are huge, definitely for sharing, family style. Well, yes, shrimps also were a little overcooked but I will overlook that, if you indulge me!! :) Definitely not good for your waist line. If you want to indulge in the freezing cold weather and don't mind to leave with a full huge belly..go to Buca di Beppo.. Your wallet and all your taste buds will LOVE you!! :))",

When I told him that I'm vegan, he went to the kitchen to ensure that the ingredients in the meal I wanted were all vegan (which they were).  I ordered the veggie pizza (without cheese).  It was thin-crust and absolutely delicious.  He asked me if I wanted balsamic vinegar and some olive oil on the side.  I said yes, and he put some in a little plate for me.  The bread was great, the pizza was great, and the waiter was great.  My family loved their food as well.  The bathrooms have some of the weirdest art up on the walls of butts and elephants doing suggestive things and fat people and naked Greek statues and every weird, crude, amusing thing you can think of.

I haven't an ounce of shame about this. Eating here is FUN.   The decor is Italian-American kitsch on crack - every nook, cranny, and square inch of wall space is filled with some fabulously tacky knickknack, souvenir, gilt reproduction of Michelangelo's David, vintage family photo, or 8 x 10 glossy of Gina Lollobrigida and Connie Francis. And, honestly, any restaurant that has a table with a rotating head of the pope as its centerpiece can serve me a TV dinner in a tin tray and I'll be THRILLED.   The food is better than that, though. It's not the best Italian food in town, or even the second or third best, but it's good enough. Entrees are served family style, so you have to share, and that's part of the fun too.   It's super-crowded on the weekends, but if you can get a group together some week night, I promise it'll be good times. Service is s-l-o-w, so get comfortable and have another glass of wine.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars.  I have been a fan of the Buca chain for a bit now as it tries to survive the Olive Garden, Bertuccis and Maggiano's Italian restaurant chain war so we decided to give this location a try. As always they serve the small-large option so I went with the small as I feel it feeds one person with left overs in that regard. So to start we got the meatballs appetizer which was actually really good had that little bit of browning to the meat ball and great taste so A+ on that and a mixed Milan Mule cocktail that went well with the food.  Main course went with the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni which was ahh ok.. now I've had this dish 2 other times and both were better then his location and serving size seemed a bit less. Some how it seemed like the sauce was a bit less spicy and if I recall it used to be a bit more of a blush sauce but either way it seemed lacking in taste. Now you can opt for extra spicy but I never recall having to.  My girlfriend got the Penne al Forno which was really good and seemed to be the better choice.  The staff were friendly, the location was typical inside with all the pictures and relaxing interior. They have an outside location which is different then some other locations. You can park at the outdoor lot or garage which runs around $5.   I would give them 3 1/2 if I could on the review just seemed like it needed a bit more kick in the pants taste wise on my dish but it won't stop me from returning I still like this local option over Olive Garden at times.  Bucca I'm still a fan and will return!",

    "text": "From what I can tell all the bad reviews are from people who didn't understand the concept of the restaurant or got bad service. If you don't come in a group don't expect the best service (not ideal for a date). This place really caters to large groups making large orders. Even their food is served this way (family style), which it seems like a lot of people didn't expect. I've been there twice in 2 different years and experienced great service and great food both times. The servers were accommodating of splitting checks as well, even with large parties involved.   My favorite thing that I've had there was the penne a la vodka, mainly because most restaurants serve mediocre vodka sauce and this one actually holds up well against good ones. I was also a big fan of the chicken Parmesan, but if you mess that up at an Italian restaurant then you're not an Italian restaurant. The shrimp Florentine was also delicious, and my boyfriend who is a picky eater but loves shrimp ate multiple helpings of it and declared it amazing!   Aside from those dishes my friends also enjoyed the prosciutto stuffed chicken, the fettuccine supreme, and a side of the brussel sprouts with prosciutto (which I tried and were fantastic).   Touching again on their ability to cater to large groups in this section: I love this restaurant's atmosphere because it has little booths and rooms with big tables for parties. One of the times I was there they set aside a whole room for a party of 75(!!!!!!!!!) and I was amazed. I also like it because the wall is COVERED in old photographs and it's fun to look around every once in a while amidst enjoying food and company.",

One thing is consistent about this place: bad service.   I love the Buca di Beppos from Cleveland and Columbus so I expected the Pittsburgh one to be consistent, but the poor service tarnishes this location. The host and other waitresses were friendly enough but our particular waitress was sloppy and pretty terrible overall.   I came in for my birthday dinner and left with a disappointed experience.  Waitress mistakes/incompetencies: -sneakily charged us for the garlic bread when we straight up asked whether this was an appetizer. Her exact answer was \"No, it's not an appetizer but did you want to make it one?\" Such a weird response so we ordered it, thinking it was free. NOPE. $7.99 for about 6 chunks of bread. Toasty and garlicky but totally not worth it -proclaimed that she would sing for my birthday and I replied \"yeah, bring it on!\" She asked the couple seated next to us if I would like her to sing twice and I said \"only once is fine...\" VERY odd way of doing this...and for the rest of the meal she did not sing at all. False advertisement! -I opted to create my own pasta and she didn't put in 2 of the main ingredients: mild sausage and poached garlic. On the receipt, it was clear that it was her own fault b/c those ingredients weren't not entered. UGH! -had NO idea how coupons worked and asked me to show her over and over again my coupon emails. Went back and forth and even told me to make an electronic reservation online in order to activate the coupon. What? Definitely unnecessary and did not work.  I forgot her name but she wore her wispy blond her in a messy bun and had a lackluster attitude.   The food itself tasted fine and the portions were large but really was hoping this place would start offering free bread. Also, walking through the open kitchen to get to the bathroom seems unhygienic and totally bad fengshui. I'm probably never coming back to this location. *Note- my husband still tipped over 20% on our bill even though there was no reason to...",

I got four ish star American style Italian food for a decent price. I say decent as everything is super sized here. I recommend going with a group of people as even the kid's meal is toddler sized (as in big as a toddler). Take someone here on a date and you'll really get to know that individual as sharing is caring. Whatever you do don't order a meal for yourself thinking you can finish a small because you cannot! I had the cheese ravioli and for someone that isn't a red sauce fan, I was impressed. Also their white sangria is A1. Also, also, try their mozzarella garlic bread as it's pretty game changing. Beyond that as I don't eat beef or pork I skipped a lot of the menu. The staff are nice and I'm just convinced that people who give this place a low review don't understand the concept and or what they've gotten themselves into. Family style means being your family. As someone who hates Olive Garden, I prefer this place.",

When we entered the restaurant it took them a few minutes to figure out where to seat us.  This was fairly puzzling because when we were walking through the restaurant it seemed mostly empty.  We were seated in a small side room on the top floor.  I'm glad there was an elevator because without it would have been a chore to get the kids up the stairs. I hadn't been to a Buca di Beppo in at least 20 years so I forgot that all of their entrees were served family style.  Our server did explain this to us and also talked about how many people were typically served with each menu choice.  She explained what some of the favorite menu items tend to be and was very helpful in picking out items.  She also encouraged us to just order one kids meal which we definitely appreciated because the kids meal portions were huge.  I see that a lot of people complain about service, but our server was attentive and helpful. We had the Mozzarella Garlic bread to start.  It was very tasty, but a bit over priced at $9.   Our entrees were Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken and Shrimp Fra Diavolo.  The kids had the macaroni and cheese.  We really loved the chicken.  It came with four substantially sized pieces of chicken.  It was flavorful and had a nice amount of sauce.  The shrimp fra diavolo was simply \"meh\"  The shrimp were small and kind of rubbery and although the sauce was spicy, it didn't have much flavor other than spice.   My husband and I each ordered an alcoholic drink and the kids each had a milk.  Our bill was over $100.  We did get a lot of food for that amount, but I definitely would have preferred a higher quality meal with smaller portions for the same price. We probably won't be back unless we go with a party of four and are able to split the same entrees we enjoyed but also split the bill.",

We started with a salad, which was the perfect amount for all of us.   We then asked if we should be getting 2 or 3 orders for us.   She thought 3 was the right number for us.   She was so wrong.   We could have easily shared 2 and still had leftovers.   I feel like we wasted $24 on a meal.  We had the chicken Parmesan, the rigatoni and the ravioli.   The chicken Parmesan was definitely the best.   Raviolis were just ok.   The rigatoni was a humongous portion and actually would have fed the 4 of us.   We were all stuffed and my brother took all the leftovers, but likely never ate them.",

When she brought the drinks, she said there were no meatballs in case any of us were thinking of ordering them???  There went the idea of the spaghetti & meatballs we had in mind!!!  We all ordered our 2nd choice, lasagna with Caesar salad.  A long time later, she came back and said, \"I'm so embarrassed but we have no Caesar salad!  It was incredible!  We then ordered bread baskets filled with stale garlic bread and actually ate it as we hadn't eaten all day waiting for this \"special\" dining experience!

Overall 8.6/10 because the meatballs were slightly dry (but they're huge) and there could have been more sauce on the spaghetti. Definitely worth it though.",

The meatballs were as big as my head and that's pretty damn big but unfortunately that tasted horrible too. The bruschetta had absolutely no balsamic on it and had zero flavor except for the huge pieces of onion. The Mozzarella Caprese also did not have any balsamic on it and the cheese tasted like playdoh. One of us got completely raw Salmon, I mean raw, rawer than my fat thighs after a hot day in jean shorts. If you are looking for authentic Italian, this ain't it honey. They also stuff the shells with pork which I've never heard of before and the poor Jewish woman with us who ordered them is sitting in her hotel room filled with guilt and has to talk to her rabbi tomorrow. We left so much food on the table it was sinful. The manager did take a reasonable amount off the bill which we appreciated, but that doesn't make the food edible. I never complain about food because I'm fat and eat just about anything, but this was absolutely the worst meal we've ever had. All 17 of us agreed.",

We were rudely informed that because we had no reservations, we could only sit outside.  It was really nice out, so we were fine with that.  They told us that they were completely booked until 8:30pm.  Ok fine whatever, sit us outside.  Next time, just ask if we want to sit outside instead of being mean about it.  So, we sit down and my fiance' decides to check for reservations on his phone.  WE COULD HAVE MADE RESERVATIONS FOR ANY TIME SLOT THAT EVENING.  We were tempted to make a reservation for 3:45pm and walk right back to the hostess stand to prove them wrong.  We can not believe they did this.  They lied, they were NOT full or they wouldn't have had reservations online.  The food was just okay.  Nothing special.  We split a few appetizers for the table and then my fiance' and I tried the spicy chicken rigatoni pasta.  It was barely spicy and the chicken was dry and I couldn't eat it.  Overall, we were disappointed and the rude service was just the icing on the cake.  Don't think we would be back any time soon.",

However, this location didn't quite live up to my expectations...which was not great because I had dragged a colleague here with me! I like the food at Bucca and this one also had a similar quality to other locations. Except for one of the appetizers which I didn't like, but I don't remember its name...However, the restaurant itself didn't look very clean and was somewhat empty and quiet (may be this was the case only in the corner we were seated). While our waitress did her best, I don't think it was enough to improve the experience much beyond three stars. I don't live in Pittsburgh, but won't be back to this location next time I visit.   Hint: The bathroom is an interesting experience: you have to take an elevator to the second floor, pass through the kitchen. Find an excuse to use the restroom while you're there :-)",

She initially brought out our drinks but never asked us if we wanted refills. I had asked if she would bring me another drink when my entree came but I had to remind her. She only came back once to ask if everything was ok. The restaurant wasn't very busy. We watched her provide excellent service to the table in front of us. I don't know if she didn't want to provide that same experience for us because we had a $20 off coupon. Honestly you need some kind of discount because the food is overpriced. Regardless of whether I have a discount or not I tip off of the regular price. Her tip would have been better if she would have given the same service she gave others. I was happy that the manager stopped by the table to ask if everything was alright. At that time we didn't have any complaints.   I've often wondered why there haven't been any updates to the restaurant. It's very outdated.",

Since then I have been in contact with their Associate Divisional VP and they have \"made it right\" by giving me a $40 dollar gift certificate for a meal that cost around $150. That does not cover the worst entree with a tip. Keep in mind this is a family style dining restaurant so i am not going to go there and order a family sized order alone.  I am extremely disappointed by this but i am not surprised. I am not sure what i will do with the 40 dollar gift certificate.  i am either going to buy a couple drinks for me and a friend or give it to a random family i see around the restaurant.    I will always have terrible memories of a terrible birthday night dinner and the little the did to make it right.   To add insult to injury i fel like they thought they were doing me a favor by giving me the 40 dollars.  Original review  Disclainer---This review in no way reflect the waiter I had.  The waiter I had was great and I think he knew how bad the food really was.  I went to Buca di Beppo for my birthday last night to get some good Italian food but boy was I disappointed.  I had never been to a Buca di Beppo before and was excited because I was raised eating Italian food and I heard that it was really good there.  But my experience painted a very different picture.  First off the atmosphere was great,  the different and odd pictures that they had decorating the walls was interesting and the music was hits from the 60's, which I love, and the service was great.  The food however was not.  Our party started out with the famous meatballs as an appetizer.  When it came out, they looked great but were not the best.  Mine was not cold per se but not completely hot either, most of it was just barley warm and the temperature was not consistent.  The marinara was also a little watery for my taste, but all in all acceptable.  It was not until the entree came out that I felt I had been cat fished with my food.  Our first entree was the prosciutto stuffed chicken.  It was alright but I feel that there was hardly any prosiutto at all and the chicken was a little dry.  The pesto sauce that it came on was at least ok.  The second entree we got which was the reason I went there was the Short Rib Orecchiette.  I was expecting a dish with some short ribs in it.  What we received was huge bowl of pasta with about five or six pieces of short ribs the size of a M&M with a lot of mushrooms.  We were actively searching for the meat and could hardly find any.  It was essentially overly priced creamy pasta with mushrooms that a couple of pieces of meat feel into.  But the meal was not over.  Since it was my birthday my party wanted me to get a desert and thought tiramisu would be a great choice.  Well not really.  The family sized portion would have been nice, if it was any good, sadly it was not.  It was more of a cake than a traditional tiramisu, which I guess was fitting for my birthday but not what I wanted at all.  It was on the dry side and did not have much flavor.  Needless to say I will not be going back to this or any Buca di Beppos   All in all, I feel that for my birthday I feel that I was cat fished via food with Buca di Beppo.  I would steer clear of this place it is really not worth the time or the money",

My biggest complaint was that the table was rather dirty and was kind of squished into a small alcove with similar tables. I don't know if I would come back, I would probably try the to-go option in the future but only if I had a coupon or something.",

The reason for the low rating is that we had a reservation for 4:00pm, and when we got in they told us they'd get the table ready.  People who came in after us got seated before us, and we sat there for 20 minutes or so waiting.  What's the point of taking reservations if they're just going to keep us waiting anyway?!?!

I've had bunch of dishes here, never had something I didn't enjoy. My favorites are the chicken parm, stuffed shells and spaghetti & meatballs. If you want a starter, the antipasto salad is incredible and refreshing to prepare you for the large amount of carbs you're about to eat. If you save room at the end of your entrees, they also have great desserts. The Colossal Brownie Sundae is a dream come True. It is giant. Massive scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, multiple chocolate chip brownies mixed in, and a tower of whipped cream and hot fudge on top. Topping off the very top is a cherry and white chocolate decoration. Definitely check this restaurant out when you have a large group.",

After being seated it took about 20 minutes for a manager to realize we didn't have a server. She finally got the server and it was horrible the whole time. Overall we were there for about two hours and the server took forever. First to get the drinks took forever, and we waited forever for the apps, and then the main dinner with no waitress in between. My coffee got refilled only once and when it did it was disgusting. The coffee had stuff in it, and the cream was the type that comes in the small containers and had floater chunks in it that you expect to get at dirty gas stations. When you are paying over 100 dollars for a meal please serve me good coffee with proper cream. They didn't have espresso nor good coffee. I don't think it's out of the norm to enjoy good coffee and espresso with an expensive Italian meal. The food was good, but I believe over priced. I would give better stars but the service and drinks ruined it.  There are so many other Italian restaurants with better food, much better service, and ones that serve better coffee and espresso with real creamer  in this city. I wonder how this place is going to stay in business.",

I'm always impressed by the quality customer service here -- shoutout to my table's server Jason for being exceptionally efficient, quick, funny and friendly.  [Food] Man, oh man, do they have good food. If you're into carbs and cheese, this is the place for you! The portions here are ridiculous! Even with a football team of people, finishing one plate of food is a real struggle. Don't worry, though, to-go containers are available! I personally really like the Spicy Chicken Pasta. The free bread is super yummy too. Garlicky! Comes with seasoned oil too.  [Service] Best service everrr! For real, these people work hard! They deserve every penny and more. Not only do they have the challenge of tailoring to big parties but they have to load heavy plates and split checks a crazy number of times too.  [Overall Experience] This is the place to be! Great place for hangouts and parties. Family and friends are bound to have a great time. Birthdays are fun because they have a birthday song just for youuuu!",

    "text": "This is the first Buca di Beppo that I had ever been to. It introduced me to the chain when it opened here in the mid to late nineties. I've always enjoyed the food here..and the ambiance is fun. I've been to many other locations since and have enjoyed most of them, but this one will always hold a special place for me.  My most recent visit here was on a Saturday afternoon for a wake. Not the happiest of circumstances but it still did feel comforting being here. The place as a whole is pretty cozy. There are pictures all over every wall of random Italian related things..they're fun to look at..kind of makes you feel like you're at the comfort of your grandparents house.  There were about 30 people in our group, and we reserved a private room on the third floor. This location has three floors..which is a bit different..it's the only location I've ever been to that has had multiple floors like that. The layout is a bit confusing. I found myself getting lost trying to find the restroom on the second floor. There were different staircases and an elevator..and long narrow hallways to go down. It's a bit confusing for sure but if you keep walking you'll eventually end up where you're supposed to be.   Our servers that day were awesome. It has to be a bit overwhelming to have to serve a group as big as ours all at once, and to make sure everyone's specific needs are being met, but these servers did an excellent job of keeping everything organized and flowing.  There was Italian bread and dipping oils on the tables when we arrived. The oil they provide is so tasty..and their bread is so fresh and always perfectly made. Next came the salad..with the choice of a house salad or Cesar salad. I'm not a fan of salad but everyone else seemed to be enjoying it.  Buca Di Bepo is known for their \"family style\" portions of food. Meaning basically you order one big dish of a certain menu item and everyone shares it because it's big enough to feed your entire family.   For this meal they picked three entrees for everyone to choose from: Spaghetti with meat sauce, Cheese Ravioli, and Chicken Parmesan. Lucky for me those are my three favorite things on the menu.   The Spaghetti was good..and the meat sauce had so much meat in it it tasted like you were eating Spaghetti and Meatballs. The Cheese Ravioli was great..love the cheese blend they stuff them with. The Chicken Parm was the star of the meal..as it normally is. The chicken was tender and the breading was crunchy and salty and perfect. The sauce and cheese on top was tasty and the combination of the chicken, cheese, & sauce practically melts in your mouth.   The meal ended with a slice of chocolate cake. I'm not a huge fan of cake but this cake tasted really good. The frosting really made it perfect..the cake itself was a bit dry but the frosting really did a lot to moisten it up.   Great excellent food overall.  The only downside to the meal was that the food took a pretty long time to come out. We arrived at 2pm and didn't leave until almost 4. I don't really blame the servers for this though. It was a wake that we were at and I'm sure they wanted to give enough time for everyone to get settled, and have time to talk and relax and stuff. It probably wouldn't have been noticeable had we not been so hungry. I probably ended up eating 3 loaves of bread myself waiting for the food to come.  Overall, I highly recommend Buca Di Bepo. I've always had great experiences when coming here. The food is great..as is the atmosphere and the service. They are good at handling big groups, and from what I hear, prices are pretty reasonable for as much as you get. It's just a win-win-win all around.",

Staff was very friendly and our server was super helpful in deciding what to choose for dinner. We went with the baked ziti and also ordered 3 meatballs-the ziti with ricotta on top was delicious! Talk about a carb attack. Worth it! The large portion is said to feed 5 but it could definitely feed up to 7 people in my opinion. They also give you complimentary bread and oil which was also super tasty. The brownie sundae was huge and four of us split it. It tasted alright. I can say we weren't too thrilled with how hard and dry the brownies were, so I wouldn't order that as a dessert again in the future, but it was free so that was nice. They also sing a funny birthday song to you and bring out a large candle which was cool! We would definitely return in the future.",

The waitress informed us that there was a banquet going on, but we were one of the only tables in the joint.   It took a long time to get our drinks. We ordered garlic bread and that took extremely long too. We asked the server about the bread when she brought our salad and she said it would be up soon and apologized.   We got the bread 15 minutes after we were done eating our salad. The waitress said she would speak to her manager and get it removed from the bill. They removed it which was nice, but the bread tasted like it had sat on the line for a long time.   We finally got our meals over an hour and a half after we got seated. Nothing was hot, it was all lukewarm and mediocre. We sat with empty drinks frequently throughout the entire experience also.  *note: I've worked in multiple restaurants for years so I'm not an idiot customer. The place was empty so if anything the service should have been excellent. But it wasn't. And the food was even worse.   If the reason for bad food and bad service was because of the banquet.. you should just close down. Literally the restaurant itself was empty. What a joke",

For a family of 6, we ordered 4 small meals and had plenty to take home. The chicken carbonara is simply amazing!!! Highly would recommend that.

Probably won't be back.  Well I did what you asked now I'm being ignored!!  One star now",

I used to absolutley love the baked ziti but the past two times I've came its been tasteless. I visited today only because of a coupon i recieved in the mail. Not only were the noodles not good, our bread was burnt. We asked for more bread and it was burnt also.  The thing I dont like the most is that the bathroom is located in the kitchen. This is not ideal for the elderly. You have to go up two flights of steps to get there.",

    "text": "So, I went to Buca di Beppo a couple of months ago as I was in P-burgh for a meeting.  I hadn't eaten since the morning and was very hungry and thought I would drop in for an early dinner.  Bad idea.  I came in alone and not with a group and I came in early.  Not really their target demographic; however, they had no idea what to do with me.  So what did they do with me?  The put me in some back room near a kitchen.  Just me, some gangster memorabilia, big band music... and an empty room near the kitchen.  I eventually found a server and told him that I would eat at the bar, you know, where there are other people...  They let me order off the lunch menu, that was nice, so I ordered a lunch portion spaghetti.  Another bad idea.  The spaghetti sauce was terrible, tasted like catsup, the pasta was \"old\" and seemed like it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of days and the meatball tasted like they walked over to McDonalds and asked for some hamburger meat.  I realize that Buca really isn't structured to serve the one-man early-dinner customer.  And that is another drawback.  The place is located in a business center area.  They need to know who their potential customers are.  The Station Square location is kind of odd, it is tucked in by the river between the tunnels.  However, just walk across that cool bridge and find a local place across the river in the down town area.  Avoid Buca unless you are with a big group and want a pasta-heavy meal.  Actually, there are Italian restaurants across the river or further up Carson.  Just avoid Buca.  Not going back to Buca, in any city.  Aside, P-burgh is a cool town and I can't wait for my next trip back.",

Cannoli? not the best I've had but not the worst either.  I understand my sister was trying to feed lots of people as cheaply as possible but being told I had to share food with another table and keep getting up, dodging amateur photographers and seeing if they're done wiht that platter yet can we get any food............ I wasn't digging it. and I wasn't digging finding the hidden bathroom on the second floor either.

Dry pasta, barely any cheese (none of it melted), and bland meat that felt more like filler than an actual entree.  We got there and were seated promptly.  Service was good up until a party of 10 showed up down the hall and then we were the forgotten table all by ourselves in one of the sections.  The whole thing tasted and felt boxed and pre-made.  Nothing was genuine nor fresh.  Even the dessert ... I could taste freezer burn on the ice cream and the whipped topping ... the brownie was just chalky.  Bland!!!  ...I usually spend more time on reviews, but I just don't have much to say.  The pricing does not meet up to the food quality.  The service is 50-50 based on how busy they are.

To get to the restrooms, you either have to take the stairs (or the elevator) to the second floor and walk through the kitchen. I have never seen that before.

    "text": "For 6+ months I'd had a reservation for my son's rehearsal dinner at their first-date restaurant, Buca in Station Square. I only wish someone had told me they were overbooked for the night. We were a party of 40 put into a room for 30, with a separate area with 2 additional booths, not what I had expected and not a good way to \"Blend families\" . We were also told there were 2 other rehearsal dinners that evening, which I'm assuming is why even though we were 20 minutes late for our reservation, it took another 30 min to get settled; we needed additional chairs, waited for salads & bread & champagne for a toast. For this 30 minutes we had 1 server for 40 people. Also, the temp inside was about 90 degrees, no lie. The 2 infants were down to only diapers in an attempt to cool them off. The staff told us they are not allowed to fan themselves to playoff the burning temp. You could see the sweat on the brow of many.  Our reservation was for 730. Around 820 we started to receive bread, etc. At 830 finally additional servers were able to jump in; I'm guessing one of the other dinners had ended by this point. Once we got the additional servers, the food & service was excellent. However, as the host it is very stressful to watch 40 people waiting for food and receiving the wrong drink orders if getting ANY at all. When I addressed each issue with the manger, first the dissatisfaction with the space and then at the end of the night the delay in service, she disagreed and almost argued with me. She gave me NO discount or satisfaction not that anything could have saved the night. We finished @ 1020pm, A bit late for the night b4 a wedding. I was so aggravated after planning this for months. I highly encourage you to consider other venues for your party.  Just not a good value; POOR MANAGEMENT!",

Ten minute wait, but when we were actually seated, most of the tables around us were empty.  The place was a mess -- unbussed tables and the nearby bar counter was loaded up with dirty glassware, some of which came crashing down at one point.  Servers were tossing silverware and dishes into a dirty collection area right next to our table.  Servers ambled through the place like characters from a slacker movie.  It took about 15 minutes for our server to come to the table and he appeared drunk, slurring his words and couldn't seem to walk straight.  Ordered.  Another 15 minutes to get our drinks.  The big bowl of green salad came and it was green all right -- practically nothing but iceberg lettuce.  The final straw was when two kids sat down at the next table and our server sat down with them.  They were obviously friends and carried on a conversation that would be more appropriate for a gogo bar.  Abort.  I found the manager and said we wanted the check.  He had a besieged look on his face and was hardly surprised.  Seemed like he had seen it all before.  He took our drinks off, we paid and left.  It's too bad because I love the concept of family-style Italian dining and remember some good meals I had at this place years ago.",

When we called it to his attentuon, he acted like I was lying. He literally said, \"I think you guys are lying.\" He didn't even apologize or anything.

    "text": "I visited the station square location (the second time I ever visited a Buca di Beppo period) this past saturday for my bf's niece's 18th birthday late lunch/early dinner. I expected it to be on par with Olive Garden (which I'm not a fan of the \"commercialized\" Italian places) but I agreed with the reasoning behind going here-we were a party of 11, the food is family style, and there should be enough variety ordered for everyone. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. First I will say, we should have been seated elsewhere. We were, again a party of 11, that was cramped into the back corner of the basement (near the bar), and anytime someone had to get up to use the restroom, there would be a lot of shuffling and getting up amongst everyone. Considering it was 3pm, it was not crowded at all and we could have been sat elsewhere. Our server, Cody, was very efficient-constantly refilling drinks, getting new plates,etc. For appetizers we ordered:the artichoke florentine dip,the fried calamari,the stuffed mushrooms, and the mozzarella garlic bread. In particular, the stuffed mushrooms were excellent (the sage and rosemary flavors were very prevalent) as was the artichoke dip. This was just enough food to satisfy until the entrees arrived. For salads we ordered an apple gorgonzola salad ,which was excellent but is very commonplace at restaurants currently, and a mixed greens salad. As for entrees: the prosciutto stuffed chicken, the veal marsala (my favorite-the sauce was sweeter than a typical marsala and paired excellently with the veal),chicken and sausage ziti (the sausage had a little surprising kick to it although it was supposed to be the mild sausage),spaghetti with meatballs ( I did not sample this but looked basic minus the gigantic meatballs),vegetable lasagna (I did not partake in this either),stuffed shells (I particularly enjoyed the sausage in them). We did bring our own dessert so I cannot comment on that either but I will say my expectations were far exceeded with the quality of the food since this is a \"chain restaurant\". Our party also got a kick out of the decor!",

    "text": "After reading and hearing rave reviews of how great this place and since it's conveniently located across the street from my hotel, I decided to try this place. As I walked in for my reservation, I was greeted and provided a tour around the restaurant, which although part of a ubiquitous chain, maintains a traditional Italian look. My guest and I decided we were going to order a bottle of their house white wine, small order of \"mozzarella\" garlic bread, chicken parm with spaghetti, and a salad . Although I had a great impression because of their customer service, I had to deduct a star because even though on the menu it states \"mozzarella garlic bread\", the mozzarella cheese was practically nonexistent--which was unfortunate since I love cheese-- and the garlic bread was mediocre; hard Italian bread, cut up into small squares. Also, if you order the chicken parm, don't expect a free complementary side as the chicken parm comes by itself so, of course, we had to order spaghetti. On a brighter note, the salad was great, so I recommend ordering that! I spent $92, which I felt was kinda pricey considering that lackluster garlic bread.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars. It was the worst experience of my life. Never ever go there!!!! Food was terrible. Service was horrible. My family used to go there at least once a month for years and years. But I can honestly say this location is a disgrace and should be shut down. We used to like it so much we chose this chain when we were on a family trip.  Being that it was always consistent. The experience I had will force me never ever to go back. Frankly I'm appalled at how much it has gone downhill in the past few years. They offered to comp my garlic bread for my poor experience. I said I would pay for it. I wanted the manager to understand I'm not trying to get a discount. I was complaining so she would realize how many things went wrong with my experience.  1. Dirty table and booth 2. Not greeted timely by the waitress 3. Drinks were not refilled 4. Garlic bread did not come out with app as requested 5. Manager said ticket time for dinner was only over 30mins even though we put it in over an hour earlier. Claiming the food is put in after the app. Which is fine if the waitress courses it properly. However 20 mins after we ordered we were told that they were out of ravioli. And we're treated as if we were inconveniencing them.  6. Manager talked to us and tried to be friendly but did nothing to speed up or improve our service 7. The kitchen staff was laughing and yelling so loud I could here it from the dining room 8. Bathrooms were a disgrace. Dirty and smelled 9. Table tents were dirty   I always patiently wait if I see my waitress is busy or I can tell the staff is overwhelmed. It was a Wednesday at 8. Maybe 3 tables were there and plenty of staff. I consider myself to be a reasonable person. I cannot fathom how this place is even open. The location is phenomenal. But everything else about this restaurant is gone. Save your money. The buca of the past with great family style American Italian food is now a dilapidated she'll of what it was.",

Deserts were a very rubbery tasteless cheesecake and dry dry dry brownie.  Avoid !!! Noise level was very loud and painful because room was small for group.  And the decor of the restaurant was stuck in a time warp and not in a positive nor tasteful way.  Run do not walk away ....",

Service was much better and more professional (for both lunch and dinner), if only just a bit slow afterward for getting the check. Food was not half bad either. Meatballs were on the big side (then again, so was everything else), but very hearty, especially with the marinara sauce. We really liked the make-your-own combination pasta, which allowed us to customize everything from the pasta to the sauce to the meat and vegetables. With up to three veggies and a meat, it was a pretty filling meal, even with the small size for two people. The marinara was a bit watery when we got this, but that was the only negative that we found.",

Waitstaff rushed around, managers (and even cooks) came out to update us on the status of our table and at 7:40, we were finally seated... on the chilly patio.  It took a while for our waitress to arrive to take orders, but one of the cooks was nice enough to send out 3 appetizers gratis for our long wait time. Food appeared in a decent amount if time and it was standard Buca fare. There was enough to feed an army, with a ton of leftovers to take home.  We frequent this location every year around the first of October and most likely will be back in 2013. Hopefully next time it won't be so hard to get a seat!",

    "text": "I wonder when the interior designers snuck into my Gramma's house and got the ideas for the interior of these restaurants? They have all the knick-knacks that every Italian household had. I still remember every room had a picture of Jesus, one whole wall of my Gramma's kitchen was decorated with calenders, why you ask? They were colorful, and everyone from banks, to churches to the local funeral parlor gave them out at Christmas time, they were a cheap way to decorate, no lie! Italians loved colorful little things that they could put everywhere, and this is what you get at Buca di Beppo.  The food's not bad either, I had a dish that was pasta with a delicious plumb tomato and fresh herb sauce. I swear the \"single\" serve lunch special was a pound and a half of pasta and easily twelve ounces of sauce. Was it authentic? Nah, not in the least. Was it good? Damn right it was, fresh herbs kick the flavors of everything up. The waiter started off the lunch by bringing over a few baskets of warm bread, and \"making\" a dipping \"sauce\" as we called it back in the day. he mixed some olive oil, dried herbs and balsamic vinegar on a plate, we all dug in!  Gramma would cut her home made bread and heat up a little olive oil with smashed garlic, add salt and pepper and we'd dip our bread into it for an authentic Italian lunch. We'd also have dried salami, chunks of Romano cheeses and fresh fruit with wine. That's the way we used to eat back when I was growing up with my \"Little Gramma\".   Buca also has giant meatballs, lasagna, ravioli, and a pretty darn good looking sicilian style pizza done only with flesh mozzerella, and fresh basil on a bed of simple sauce. Come hungry and be prepared to take home lots of doggie bags.",

    "text": "Wow.  So much to say about the Thanksgiving 2015 experience. I realize the last time I reviewed Buca was in 2007, and my have things changed.  It's a chain, I get that, more on that later.    We arrived with a reservation for 6 but added two who were not eating.  That threw them through a bit of a loop but they handled it well.  If it weren't for the staff being able to rework the reservation, they would have gotten 1 star.  What I remember most fondly about Buca was their garlic bread with cheese.  It used to be served in this cast-iron pie dish.  Not anymore. Instead, this gummy, undercooked (COLD) garlic bread arrived at the table.  I guess cold is the theme for the meal.  The house salad did fine but was sort of not impressive enough to distract from the cold bread.  Wine was served.  And drank.  And drank.  Because it took our food FOREVER to come.  We ordered the traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 and a large side of pasta (when in Rome).  After our meal arrived, we dug in.  Turkey Breast (so SO DRY) on top of stuffing (which most folks liked) both were COLD.  Mashed potatoes (those were pretty good, but cold.. If they weren't cold, I would have had seconds). Green beans (cold).  We told the waitress but she was empathatic.  The manager came out and offered to give us more food but because we had waited SO LONG to begin with, we dug in and didn't find it necessary to wait again for more food.  Pasta dish was cold on the top and hot on the bottom.  I think a lot could improve on this visit.  The restaurant wasn't packed, so there was definitely some disconnect between the kitchen and the servers.  I likely will not return to Buca.  The empathetic management and poor quality of food is just not worth the expense.",

While I waited in the bar area off of the lobby, I noticed that there were these plug in floral air fresheners. It smelled horrible all around me. Apparently they are attempting to mask the dirty smell that was coming from the carpeted floor and walls around me. Next, I thought that I saw a mouse!! I was not sure so I stood up and went into the well lit Lobby. It smelled in that area also. I decided to go upstairs to the ladies room. The entire way up the disgusting odor was all around. I passed the kitchen area into the filthy bathroom. I didn't use it, I turned around and returned to the Lobby. I paid for my order, gathered it and left. I am not going to say what I did with the food.  Do NOT eat here.   ATTENTION STATION SQUARE..... YOU NEED QUALITY RESTAURANTS IN AN AREA THAT MANY TOURISTS VISIT!!
