While you may wait a few moments to get a booth, if you like sushi it is worth the wait, and is the freshest I have ever had!  Prices are a little high, but I think the sushi is worth it. Honestly, I have not tried much else on the menu, as I come to this place for one purpose: sushi.  I also love that they serve hot tea with your meal for free. Such a lovely touch!!",

Although the egg rolls shine, classic dishes such as chicken and broccoli and (white meat - must specify) general tso's chicken simply cannot be ignored. Luckily, such oral stimulation distracts patrons from the decor - as the restaurant resembles a gymnasium from 1982.   In short: come for the egg rolls, cherish the complementary tea, and keep your head down.",

I came here with my fellow supervisors because we wanted to have a little luncheon and we were all in the mood for Chinese.    It's still a great deal for lunch, even though the prices have gone up a little since my last review.  Most lunches are in the $7.50-$7.95 range and include choice of egg roll or soup, plus your choice of rice and hot tea and fortune cookies.  Great deal, but can't I have both soup and egg roll with my lunch?  Especially since I like both hot-n-sour and egg drop soups.  Lunch here is your typical somewhat Americanized Chinese fare, including sweet-n-sour pork, cashew chicken, chow mein, etc.  For those of you wanting spicier fare, they've got your usual Hunan beef, General Tso's Chicken, and shrimp Szechuan style.  Me, I prefer milder, more basic chow.  I went for the shrimp with broccoli.  So as far as the lunch menu is concerned, there's nothing here that'll set the world on fire, but Mandarin Gourmet is good for a basic lunch.",

If you are going to offer delivery, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DELIVER IN A TIMELY MANNER!  I thought that their online ordering feature would make this whole issue easier. HA! What a joke. Yes, your ordering is easier, but if they don't check their online orders then they can't actually fill or deliver them!  Their customer service also leaves something to be desired.  When you call to complain all you get from them is \"Oh, on its way\" or \"Delivery guy left.\" No customer service, no regard for customer orders, just terrible.  Honestly, we probably won't ever order from them again, which is a shame because they really are the only decent Chinese restaurant in town.",

China Palace in Shadyside)  They have a good lunch special and the service is pretty fast for a large dining room. The location is great. It is a good lunch spot downtown to sit, have lunch, and be on the go within an hour.    You will not impress a date or client with this place...you (or they) could do better.  But for a get-out-of -the-office for an hour lunch with friends, this will do just fine.  The restrooms are weirdly outside the restaurant in the lobby of the YMCA.  Which is fine, just weird.",

I can't speak to the authenticity of the food here, since I have never been to China, but I can say that this is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. That's compared to Tong Garden in Brookline, Ka Mei in Squirrel Hill, Tasty in Shadyside, Yen's in East Liberty, Sichuan House in Scott Twp and East Wind in Green Tree, to name a few. And I definitely prefer Mandarin Gourmet over PF Chang's.   Granted, I have never tried a meat dish here. I always get the tofu because it is exquisite. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it is very substantial and a welcome treat to vegetarians and omnivores alike.   The staff is very personable as well. I called on a Sunday when they were closed for a private party and the manager took my order anyway.   At lunch, the place is always hoppin'. It is Tuesday at noon right now and the place is packed. Lots of white collars and ties, but I often see students, too.   Maybe it's just personal preference, but I can't get enough of this place.",

I like to think that I am fairly open about assessing a new place, but the is not a Chinese restaurant.  The best thing that I can say about the entire experience is that it didn't taste bad -- there was NO flavor in anything .  Wow...really?  I can only think of the Allegory of the Cave when reading previous reviews and then to feel sorry if this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Really?!?!?  As I was walking here, I saw that their specialty was sichuan/szechuan and hunan styles of cooking.  I thought that was awesome since I prefer szechuan style cooking.  Don't believe what you read though.  The best approximation of the the taste and texture of this food is the cheap Cantonese dishes that I ordered in Hong Kong -- the difference is that I only paid 25 cents for three times as much food.  The food we ordered:  Pan fried pork dumplings Wonton Egg drop Combo fried rice (yeung chow) Kung Pao chicken Unsweet Tea Coke  The service was HORRIBLE.  The server only had THREE tables and she was running around like Foghorn Leghorn after Colonel Sanders chopped off his head in Family Guy.  What made it worse is that the owner/manager was watching the entire time and not interceding to try and make the experience better.  For your benefit, I will list the order of how my order arrived:  1. Fried Rice (entree) - after 15 minutes of waiting 2. Egg Drop Soup and Wonton Soup (appetizer) - 10 minutes after the fried rice 3. Coke and Iced Tea (drinks) - 5 minutes after the soup. 4. Kung Pao Chicken (entree) - 20 minutes after our drinks arrived. 5. Dumplings (appetizer) - a good 10 minutes after the Kung Pao chicken.  I am not going to bore you with the poor excuses uttered by the waitress, at least she appeared to be trying in the best way she could.  The fact that the manager/owner was just watching the entire situation just pissed me off.  I didn't finish eating anything.  If you enjoy eating coagulated goop in differing levels of solidity, then this is the place for you.  If you don't like Chinese food because it tastes like the food at this place, please try again in a different place -- this is NOT good Chinese food.  The most amazing part was the table of 5 Chinese men that were sitting at the table next to me.  They were continually asking for items that they were not recieving.  Two of the gentlemen actually went to speak to the manager -- IN CHINESE -- and the manager still did nothing.  Horrendous. At $20 per person, this is quite overpriced.    I shall never return.",

If I could, I'd probably give it 3.5 stars.  With large lunch specials and an inviting space for patrons who prefer to stay and eat, the MG balances their somewhat greasy and oversauced standard chicken, pork, and beef dishes with hospitality, fast service, and never providing a truly bad meal.  As a regular who eats there once a week or so, the management and staff recognize me - such personal attention at a downtown restaurant!  What's more, if you tire of their run-of-the-mill General Tso's or Sesame Chicken, try their soup noodle dishes for a refreshing change.  Lunch specials come with soup or an egg roll and your choice of rice.  I always get steamed rice simply because the amount of sauce included with the dish will usually permeate the rice anyway.  If you eat there, the rice will come in a separate bowl, as opposed to the one-piece tupperware you receive if you choose to grab take-out instead.  Their portions, as I mentioned, are large; the MG is one place that won't leave you wondering how soon you'll get to eat dinner.",

    "text": "I stopped in with a friend who came downtown specifically to have lunch. We decided on Mandarin Gourmet and were seated immediately. A young gentleman came to our table with placemats, water and tea - but no tea cups. The tea cups were eventually placed in front of us and he asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the Sesame chicken with white meat and my friend ordered the General Tso's chicken also with white meat. Both were lunch specials and were served with an egg roll.   The egg roll came out warm, but not hot - like it was sitting under a heat lamp. I TRIED to lift the lid on the sauce at the table, but it was stuck to the jar. I wondered when it was last cleaned. We skipped the sauce and ate plain egg rolls that weren't great, but they weren't awful either.   Our meals came piping hot. I ate two pieces of chicken and then the third piece that I put in my mouth was chewy. I spit it out in my napkin and realized that it was all fat or skin. I took another bite and the chicken tasted old - reheated or something. It just didn't taste right. I decided to work on the rice and wait for a server. One came by and dropped the check off so quickly that I didn't have a chance to say anything. I thought surely someone would notice a full plate and at the very least offer a box. 20 minutes went by and my friend was finished, so we decided to leave.   I told the cashier of my experience and she ARGUED with me that the chicken is fresh. I said that may be the case, but it tasted AWFUL. She said she would be right back. She came back 2 minutes later and with a line of 5 people waited to be seated, she offered us 20% off of the check. I said I ate 3 pieces of chicken, an egg roll and some rice. That is hardly 20%! I was finally so frustrated that I paid - and did not leave a tip. I rarely do that, but I felt that the service failed miserably.  Needless to say, we will not be back.",

Almost gourmet....shall we say, compared to the slop served up at PPU.    I feel like people can legitmately say there's a difference between Tex Mex and authentic Mexican.  Is there really an authentic Chinese food?  Is General Tso a real person?  All these questions...irregardless....  I love this place!  I think the shrimp rolls deserve the highest rating with a nice crispy outside and crispy cabbage inside.  My go to meal choice of Sweet n' Sour chicken is always fab.  I love that they put enough sauce on (which is a lot, so beware if you don't like a lot) that I can mix it up in my oh so healthy white rice...cough cough.  And I LOVE that they give you free tea and it's good!  I never use sweetener.  It's some sort of Jasmine blend and I always enjoy going with people that don't drink a lot because I usually drink it all!  And for realz, how do you beat the Lunch Special?  A choice of Egg Roll or soup: fried rice, steamed rice or brown rice and tea for $7.50.  Bam, full until....2...hours....later....But that's the joy of Chinese.  And boy did it taste good going down!  Best fortune I ever received was also from here: \"Life is better with a cat.\"  Meow!",

    "text": "Road Trip Dinner #2 - Pittsburgh, PA  After a day spent going to and visiting Fallingwater, my parents and I decided to stop in Pittsburgh for dinner.  They wanted Chinese, and since we were parked nearby, we pretty much stumbled onto this restaurant by default.  The restaurant doesn't look too promising at the start.  It's a big restaurant by American-Chinese food standards, and most of it was sitting empty.   A look through the menu wasn't too promising, either.  It revealed a restaurant trying to attract a broad customer base by including many different cuisines.  The skeptic in me believes that any restaurant that tries to branch into different cuisines is usually not good at any of them.  On the other hand, American-Chinese isn't a great cuisine to begin with, so if   The Fujianese owner spoke some halting Mandarin, so we couldn't communicate as much as we'd like to.  Luckily, the waitress did speak good enough Mandarin, so we were able to tell her what we wanted.    First off, cooked vegetables for my mother (of course).  The restaurant had a pleasant treat for us: yu choy (or choy sum), a Cantonese vegetable that's rarely encountered in any American-Chinese restaurant.  We got a big plate of the yu choy that was cooked not too greasily and flavored nicely and subtly.  We also started our meal off with three bowls of hot and sour soup.  My mother remarked that the tofu in the soup was very fresh, which was good news for our next dish.  The mapo tofu was fresh, spicy, and very well cooked.    We also ordered the pepper steak, and it was not bad.  The beef was fresh and cooked well, but the dish wasn't very remarkable otherwise.  Overall, the restaurant offered a nice surprise to a few weary travelers looking for some decent Chinese food.  **Advice when eating at all American-Chinese restaurants: ask the restaurant to cook your food in less oil/salt.**   The restaurant also offers Japanese cuisine (definitely) and Thai cuisine (maybe, I don't remember) on their menu.  I didn't try either of them, so I can't comment.  Overall, my favorite part of the restaurant was probably the decor.  I liked the high ceilings, muted aquamarine color scheme, and the tall windows overlooking the city streets.  When I think of a restaurant located around the downtown office buildings of a mid-sized American city, somehow, this restaurant's setting is exactly what I think of.  Get yourself a booth next to the windows and relax in the urban setting around you.",

This place has the best shrimp and broccoli so far! The shrimp are a nice size, the broccoli is fresh and the garlic sauce is the best I've tasted to date. I haven't dined in at this establishment, but it is always packed around lunch time and service seems to be pretty fast. The only con was the wait time for my meal, but I will attribute that to busy lunch hour. Other than that, this place has a good shrimp and broccoli dish, I cant attest to anything else on their menu.",

I've eaten what we Americans consider to be \"Chinese food\" all across the country and it all pretty much has the same general flare to it. It's usually fried, comes with a side of duck sauce and gives you a stomach ache afterwords. Mandarin Gourmet technically is no different then any other Americanized version of Chinese food however the service really sets it apart.  I have been going here since college and never had bad service or bad food. The staff always is very friendly and sadly they recognize me when I come in. The prices are comparable to any other sit down Chinese establishment.   The best time to go is lunch. No matter how full the building is you will be out in 30 minutes and that's if you take your time. No matter what I've ordered I get my meal in minutes. It's kind of unbelievable.  All things considered I have no reason eat Chinese anywhere else downtown. While most Chinese food is pretty much the same this place really stands out.",

It's greasy , soggy limp veggies served on rock hard dried out rice. The Mandarin Gourmet wow what a laugh, not worth my time , energy or money.

    "text": "This afternoon, I had a chance to catch a meal at an old regular lunch spot.  My fortune today:  Balance life with a little sweet & sour.  A very fitting fortune and advice I am taking in writing this review.     The sour: I have all but given up on Asian Cuisine in Pittsburgh.  Compared to other major cities throughout the US we, Pittsburgh, are strongly lacking.  That said this is one of the better options for Chinese/Mandarin food in the area.  My rating of 4 stars is based on the fact there are no really great options available.  In any other major city this place is a 2-3 star restaurant at best.  The sweet: While I have had other menu items, today I opted for the General Tso's (White Meat) with brown rice and a Shrimp Egg Roll.  First off, I like that they have the option to go with white meat for the dish.  The sauce is just a tad too sweet for me but I think it will be suited for others who do not care for spicy heat.  I like the option to get brown rice but I recall it was free before and now there is an up charge.  I still say go for the brown rice as the Mandarin Inn is tops in getting the consistency right. There are multiple options for an egg roll or spring roll with chicken or shrimp in the egg roll options.  The best part of the meal and what keeps me coming back is the spicy mustard.  This stuff will bring tears to your eyes in large amounts and will also really clear the sinuses, if needed.  I recommend this for anyone not fearing some strong horseradish flavor.  All in all, I had a good meal and will continue to return to this establishment when I am downtown and my craving for some Asian cuisine starts to peak again.",

    "text": "So the food is pretty good. Good enough that I've dealt with their b.s. about making me wait for 20-30 minutes every time I make an online order for takeout. Their system asks for a pickup time and I usually come 10 minutes AFTER that pickup time. Then I still am forced to wait another 20-30 minutes for them to get the order out. I ordered soup, quite possibly the easiest thing for you to get out the door and you still can't manage to get it together. What if I had ordered some \"super complicated\" like a stirfry? Would I have had to wait three hours for that?   Today was the last straw, I made the order 90 minutes ahead of time. Came to pick it up a little bit after the time stated and still sat there for 20 minutes. I only have a 30 minute lunch, it takes a few minutes to walk to the restaurant and a few back so their continued \"just a few more minutes\" meant that I was looking at coming back to the office without even two minutes to eat my lunch. So I just left. I am DONE with this place.   Be honest that you cannot get orders out on time. All I ordered was soup, something you have already made. ALso, there was only ONE table in the restaurant with customers. Just one 4-top. You cannot tell me that you were slammed, or had other issues.   Now I find myself at work without lunch and no time to get any food until about 5 pm when I can leave and go home. Next time I want take-out I'll go someplace with a bit of respect for their customers.",

    "text": "While walking down Wood Street last week, I almost came to a screeching halt.  The sign in the window of Mandarin Gourmet almost flashed GLUTEN FREE GLUTEN FREE GLUTEN FREE at me like some sort of wanton (wonton?) Asian temptress.  Gluten free Chinese outside of my regular relationship with PF????  Be still my heart.    When I got back to the office, I immediately corralled a couple of coworkers to get REAL Chinese with me the next day.  Oh boy, it wouldn't be the Americanized version old PF dishes up, it would be authentic! I could hardly wait, the anticipation killed me.  Oh PF, you'd never know (and I sure wouldn't tell you) I was thinking of straying from our steady relationship for another GF Chinese meal.    So the next day we giddily (okay, full disclosure - I was the only giddy one) headed into the somewhat dingy and dated space - I wasn't there for stylish decor, I could get that at PF's.  Besides...it added to the excitement of living on the edge.  Bring on the new stuff!    For starters, of the 3 typical soups, hot and sour, wonton and egg drop, only the egg drop was GF.  One taste and I I was beginning to regret my errant ways.  The soup was eerily bright yellow, tasted like dishwater and had an grease slick on top that rivaled the gulf oil spill.  No chicken on earth has ever been a color that could have produced such a hue.  (shiverrrrrrr)  Did I make a mistake in straying?  Should I have remained faithful to my trusted PF?    Still, the Kung Pao chicken tickled my fancy of forbidden delights - I looked forward to those familiar hot & spicy flavors from someone new and different.  Soon, there it was right in front of me - a HUGE pile of rice creating a wall to corral a flood of crunchy peanut topped veggies and chicken.  I'd ordered it \"spicy, please\" envisioning hot and steamy fun to come.  Nope...hot it wasn't.  I had to ask for something to kick up the heat.  There was a fair amount of chicken amidst mostly celery and a few pieces of carrot - maybe some onion, but it wasn't really distinguishable, although one giant bottom of a green pepper was hidden at the bottom of the plate.  The best part of lunch was the crunchy peanuts perched atop the dish.    Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I know I have only myself to blame.  In my excitement, I forgot how hard it is to find really good Chinese food, how before the GF issue the only 2 places I really liked were The Great Wall in Ross and Sesame Inn.  Lesson learned.  ANY gf Chinese food is not the same as GOOD and reliable gf Chinese food.    Hey PF!  I didn't really cheat on you, it wasn't the real thing...it was just a silly momentary fling.  Will you take me back?  You know I can't live without you....or your lovely lettuce wraps!",

Two busy working parents, money is tight, let's have a bit of a special dinner, \"OK..let's go up the hill and have dinner at Bamboo Palace!\". Had sliced pork with scallions, Mrs. had General Tso's chicken, little girl had chicken with mei fun, and veggie kiddo had broccoli and garlic sauce. Everyone was thoroughly satisfied!

Overall, I would say the quality of their food is very good for the price and portions they're serving. One order usually has me eating General Tso's for the next few meals. The lunch specials have even better deals, so if you're a penny pincher like me, jump on those discounts. My usual is the General Tso's Tofu which is amazinggg! Crispy tofu wins my heart every time. Their Mei Fun is also another great option I highly recommend. However, like most Chinese places, steer clear of the sushi. Just don't do it. It's more disappointing than their stale fortune cookies.  Don't be surprised if you experience rude customer service for dine-in. I've had a few run-ins with grumpy or nonexistent waiters, so I do take-out whenever possible. Less wait time for food and limited social interaction - best combination.",

Vegetable fried rice, egg rolls, tofu dishes are all good options. Also great service. Sometimes restaurants are just in to getting people in and out as fast as they can and sacrificing good service. Not my experience. Solid food and nice people.",

Chicken egg role tasted soggy and bland. Rice was gross and sesame chicken was fried pieces with sauce dumped over some of it. It was terrible. Worse than food? The duck sauce/hot mustard caddy that hadn't been cleaned or swapped out since my last visit. Left food mostly untouched. So disappointed. Can't go home again.",

    "text": "Mandarin Gourmet is one of my go-to restaurants when I want to treat myself to lunch downtown. One of the few places downtown where you can still get a great meal for under $10! They get very busy around noon (just like every other place downtown!) so plan to spend a little more time if you are there during their busy times. The service has always been great and the servers are extremely friendly and courteous.  They have a very extensive menu with both a Chinese and Japanese section. While I'm sure most of the items are Americanized versions rather than authentic cuisine, they have enough options that you can be sure that even the pickiest eater will find something they like.  They have a great lunch special that comes with an entree, rice and either soup or an egg roll for just around $8.   Great option for take-out also!",

    "text": "A coworker hipped me to this place when I was whining about wanting sushi, but didn't want to walk all the way to Sushi and Rolls (It's in Oxford Centre, i'm near 6th and Wood), and didn't want only have \"rolls\" as my only choice of a lunch special (#1 Sushi in Market Square...they REALLY need to offer better lunch specials).  So my first experience was with take out sushi about a month ago - very impressed! I ordered the Sushi Lunch Special for $11.50. The description reads \"6 pieces of sushi, California Roll.\" (Specials come with soup or salad.)  I thought: \"I've seen this trick before...\" (The one where you pay an arm and a leg for a \"sushi special\" and they just load you up with rice.)  As it turned out the rice-to-fish proportion was spot on. The fish was fresh. And the Cali rolls were good. Not the BEST sushi ever, but for the price, it was an excellent value! The miso soup was yummy...but it's kind of hard to screw up miso soup.  My second experience was today when I was craving something spicy and only had about $8 (my total ended up being $8.50) to spend. Hunan chicken to the rescue! I do avoid carbs like the plague, so I did not indulge in one of the offered sides (some kind of fried roll, or soup), nor did I get rice. I asked them to instead load up the entree with veggies - I was *extremely* happy when they were willing to accommodate, but of course did not know what to expect...  And I was, again, pleasantly surprised when I opened my bag and saw one of those 7\" round take-out containers nearly bursting it was so full! Even with the additional veggies, I was surprised by how much chicken was in the dish! Good proportion - I'll get two meals out of it!  I'm not in love with the Hunan sauce, but it's acceptable. When I see that little \"chili\" symbol next to a dish, I expect way more heat! I will have to remember to ask for extra spicy next time. Also, the overall flavor of the sauce was lacking...  Both times, the service I received was excellent, but I have only gotten take out, so I'll be curious to see if that's different experience with the staff.  All in all, great deal for downtowners who like Asian food!",

    "text": "Not the greatest experience. Went with large group.  They were short staffed and the service was poor. The server was noticeably frustrated. One of my coworkers notified the sever multiple times that she had never received her meal. It was NEVER brought out. However, the bill for her meal was. The manager later told us that the cook forgot about it. They removed it from her bill. Another coworker was charged $10 for a menu item was listed as $3.50.  The manager corrected this. My sashimi lunch platter was very disappointing. When you order sashimi you don't expect three pieces of it to be crab stick. The tuna was so salty that I could not eat it. I had to ask for the soup came with my meal. We had to ask for our waters as they only brought out enough for half of the table. Egg roll came out cold. The only reason for the three stars is that the manager was apologetic and the fact that several people in my party, especially those who ordered the shrimp tempura, were really pleased.",

    "text": "I recently came here for lunch with co-workers, and this was solid.  The decor is a bit dated, and I'm wary of Chinese restaurants that throw in Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes, as though Chinese doesn't offer enough variety on its own...but it's not exactly a criminal offense.  Most of the other diners ordered Gen. Tso chicken, which is the baseline dish that I usually order and judge all Chinese restaurants by to see if it stands up to my beloved House of Chen in Cranberry, but this time I was feeling wild.  I ordered steamed pork dumplings and the lunch special with a shrimp eggroll, eggplant garlic, and steamed rice.  Everything tasted lovely, though there were about 2 teeny shrimpies in my roll and the rest was pretty much just the shredded cabbage.  The dumplings were nice and big and delicious, and that eggplant garlic was anything but boring.  I took about half of it home, and was sluggish and sleepy for the rest of the day.  So...portion sizes are not an issue, unless you're un-American and don't like them big.  The tea tasted a bit weak.  Not that that's my main draw, but come on..it's TEA in a Chinese restaurant.  Bring your tea game up.    All of this said, I'm sure I'll be back at some point, now that I know there's a solid Chinese restaurant with ample seating downtown.",

    "text": "Well this review is more about the cleanliness than the food. Don't get me wrong the food isn't that good either but when you're in a pinch and want some greasy Chinese food this place will do. The place is old I get it but when you walk in you can tell the place is hasn't been maintained in a while. They are way understaffed. They have 2 waitresses for the entire lunch rush which doesn't make sense. The waitress I had seemed super stressed out. We had to wait to get seated. The poor old white lady forgot to take our order, then forgot to get our food. When we went to leave there was no one to ring us out.   When they bring you hot tea they just took it from the table before you that left. The water sits in prefilled glasses on a cart in the corner of the restaurant. They wiped down a dirty table with a gross and used rag. I'm assuming the general tsos sits in a bin I'm the kitchen that's why it always comes out first.  I got the pork lol mein. It was pretty tasty.   This ain't no Sesame Inn. Not even the same caliber as Chinatown in. At least it's a little better than that fu lai place.   I'm not trying to be harsh, he'll I'm proud to admit to be a Chinese American. But if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, clean your air vents. I looked in when sitting next to the window and could see the years of garbage piled up people stuffed down there years ago. If they stopped being cheap and hired more help I'm sure I would've rated this place a lot higher. You can tell the owner cuts corners everywhere.",

    "text": "With today being National Chopstick Day, I braved the frigid, 11 degree, February cold for a Chinese lunch at the Mandarin Gourmet.  This spacious restaurant was already getting a respectable crowd when I walked in around noon-time. I was quickly seated at a booth and given a menu to look over.  The lunch specials seemed very reasonably priced and I looked over my choices hoping to see chicken or beef lo-mien. Discovering that that wasn't an option I decided on the sweat n' sour shrimp with a bowl of hot n' sour soup.   A tin pot of hot tea was placed at my table and I thought, \"What a nice touch\". My hot and sour soup followed shortly behind.   The soup was thick with tofu and the broth of the soup had almost a syrupy consistency (in a good way).  I was beginning to like this place. It didn't take very long for the main dish to arrive and it came beautifully presented. I was really believing that this place was a new gem that I discovered then I took a bite into one of the sweet n sour shrimp rings and was oh so totally disappointed.   Remember that old commercial \"Where's the beef\"? Well that's almost what went through my mind... \"Where's the shrimp?\" All you could taste and all you could see was this doughy coating.  I decided to dissect one of the rings and I was able to locate the tiniest, shrimpiest of shrimp. Don't believe me?  Take a look at the pic I took of it. It's that mess on the napkin. The shrimp is on top and the dough is on the bottom.  I looked over at another table and there was a gentleman who got a broccoli and shrimp dish and his shrimp were big and plump and healthy looking compared what I got. I guess since his shrimp wasn't wearing a doughy disguise and were in plain view, the proprietors of the Mandarin Gourmet felt that they couldn't get away with serving the sickliest of shrimp to him.   Judging by what I saw on the plates of other patrons and from the crowd that they get, I'm thinking that I just choose the wrong dish today. I'm planning on coming back sometime soon and trying a menu item that doesn't have the opportunity to camouflage itself and perhaps boost my rating of this place. But as for now, it's a definite two star as far as I'm concerned.",

    "text": "I think there are three Chinese restaurants downtown and for having tried two of them, this one is my favorite. Sadly. Downtown just isn't the place for good Chinese food. Mandarin Gourmet is a good place to go if you've REALLY got a hankering for Chinese food for lunch. Otherwise, there are so many other better places to go. The lunch specials are decently priced and portioned, but the taste and quality are just okay. However, if you order take-out for dinner, it seems like they step up the quality just a notch. The dishes seem a lot fresher when you order dinner take-out. Perhaps the lunch rush has them cranking out orders too fast, or its a different cook. A tip: go somewhere else in the suburbs if you want tasty Chinese food.",

WHAT DELIVERY PERSON DOESN\"T CARRY CHANGE??? I can't pay with my credit card so what do you expect from me? I should've been called before the order was made. Luckily I had a ton of quarters which meant I had to leave the guy leave standing outside my door while i went scrounging. He had a very bad attitude too.   2. I ordered a sesame chicken lunch special. the chicken was so tough it was inedible. I had one or two pieces but it wasn't worth the calories OR THE MONEY.   3. This place is not cheap. I have had way better, way cheaper chinese food.   4. I requested chopsticks. Keep in mind i ordered online so my request was printed on the reciept order. (I know bc I've used that website to order food before). I didn't get one pair of chopsticks.   5. I also ordered steamed pork dumplings. Half were over cooked. The other half were VERY pink inside. Inedible and even when I took a bite tasted raw.   Positives: 1. fast delivery 2. cute takeout containers.   overall: never ordering from this place again.",
