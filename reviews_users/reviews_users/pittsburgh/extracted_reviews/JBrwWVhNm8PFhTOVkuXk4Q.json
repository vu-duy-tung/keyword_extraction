And the pancakes + blueberries were decent too. I wouldn't get too adventurous or expect too much, but it's handy, esp if you want to show up in grubby workout clothes and build your own salad at the salad bar.   The service at this location was always good (sometimes great) and I liked it for people watching. Nice atmosphere at odd hours - late at night, or very early, or in the middle of the morning, on a weekday. Yeah, it's a chain, but it's also very Pittsburgh. Very.  That said, the cookies taste vaguely like Play-Doh and I would never order dessert or wait for a table here. 24/7",

The Squirrel Hill location is much more low-key than most of the other Eat'n'Park restaurants in the area, and is probably the best place for families in the city. The buffet is free for kids when an adult purchases it, so there is a great selection for my kids to choose from (in addition to the extensive kids' menu), and we can all get exactly what we like! This location is clean, service is always good, and it's never crowded.",

It was about 5:30 on a Saturday but there was no wait and the restaurant was not what I would call by any definition busy. I literally waited 10 minutes with no one coming over to help me, including the manager who walked by me two times. Even while trying to get someone's attention I was ignored. I can't believe they would let a paying customer leave even after muttering out \"This is ridiculous\" which I know was heard because the employees sitting at the diner watching TV (which is what the employees there mostly seem to do) looked at me and then looked back at the TV. I wrote a complaint E-mail when I got home, which I doubt I will hear back from since no one at this restaurant seems to be held accountable for anything. I know that Squirrel Hill (and especially this restaurant) is a lax area, but this was an all-time low in dining standards for me. I know if I personally gave this kind of service (especially as a manger) I would be fired without notice. Still hoping to hear back but not getting my hopes up.",

So, the reason for the post... I went there today for a late breakfast with my family.  It's a sunday morning, so we expect to wait.  That's no big deal.  We wait for about 20 minutes to get a table and are seated.  The waitress arrives promptly and since we're trying to make it to a movie we place our order right away.  She seems nice at first and the coffee arrives quickly,,, so far so good.... 10 min, 20 min, 30 min... and no refill on the coffee or water, 40 min...waitress comes by to tell us it will be right up, 50 min, 55 min.,  looks like we're missing IronMan and I'm gonna be forced to endure the Patrick Dempsey chick flick... finally Mom gets up and finds the waitress who argues with her that it's only been 25 minutes... (Huh?).  Then says she'll send over the manager.  The manager arrives tells us they are really busy and her other manager is in the back cooking(Umm, sorry for your troubles, but having the waitress argue with the customer instead of a simple sorry has nothing to do with you being short staffed).  She offers to pay for our breakfast (which is now lunch due to the wait)... Really!  You'll comp. the $3.99 Breakfast smile.  How Generous!  No thanks, you've just wasted an hour of our lives that we'll never get back.  We leave and I'm  stuck eating goobers and watching the McDreamy flick.    The food is what you'd expect.  Nothing worth commenting on and as I just mentioned the only thing I got to try today was the coffee.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is for my childhood nostalgia for the smiley cookies.",

Hill location several times and and each time I have dined (if that's what you want to call it) at an E'nP I felt like committing Sepaku (Hari - Kiri). I never got sick from the food but more disgusted with myself for stooping to this lever of gastronomy. Nothing really worthwhile on the menu (maybe a burger- how much can you mess that up?). My gut just tells me not to trust E 'N Ps.  No offense to truck drivers of America b/c they keep supplies on our selves but It  reminds me of a truck stop restaurant without the truck drivers. I always seem to migrate to the salad bar and get weirded out for having to deal with the utensils that pick up the salad. So I wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff. The Sq. Hill E 'N P is a dive diner chain for sure. I even think there have been a few hold ups here in the past. It's not like I would ever say to my friends in NY, SF, London or wherever...\"Hey when you come to Pittsburgh be sure to go to an E 'N P to get the flavor of the city\". Obviously this place appeals to a certain class of people of which I guess I can't be a part of as much as I want to be at times.",

So what's the dining experience like? Solidly OK. It's not great food, but it's not bad. I do think you can get better diner food, cheaper, in a lot of places around town. But at 3AM? Especially if you're not in a state to drive to Denny's down on McKnight? This always has been, and remains, a decent choice.  The service is hit-or-miss, but usually fine. It more depends on the clientele that might be there on any given night. The more jags who have come to eat, the longer it'll take for your coffee to be refreshed. I don't envy the waitstaff's plight.  The quesadilla is serviceable, as is the turkey club on rye. You can't go wrong with any of the fried stuff, either -- cheesesticks, fries, et al.  Honestly? The redesign of this place is purely cosmetic. This is the same Eat n Park you remember from high school, minus the smoking.    A parting note: the men's urinal was shaped like the Triforce.

I decided to pop into my local Eat'n Park over break with three friends from home, all of whom had also grown up on Smiley Cookies.  We were seated and greeted quickly by an extremely personable waitress.  After chatting for a few minutes, we ordered -- the food arrived less than 10 minutes later.  Before it did, however, we sampled the large salad bar (just $3 on top of a meal).  Although it did not live up to its usual standards (no spinach or romaine offered) it was still a delicious first course.  Our meals were also quite good.  Eat'n Park prides itself at purchasing all of its dairy and meat products locally -- this was quite evident.  One friend ordered a chicken sandwich while the other got a large cheeseburger; both, they said, were excellent.  I got two large whole grain blueberry pancakes.  And because Eat'n Park is the \"Place for Smiles,\" my flapjacks were topped with a powdered sugar grin.  The pancakes were thick with warm, blueberry-goodness -- hardly in need of the large bowl of maple syrup they arrived with.  After the meal, my friends and I stayed to chat for more than an hour.  This was no problem for our waitress, who continually returned to make chit-chat and refill our water.  By the time we left, we were not only sated by our food, but by the wonderful Pittsburgh establishment we just visited.  And, of course, we got a few Smiley Cookies for the road.  I can assure you they are as good today as they were when my grandmother bought them for me a decade and a half ago.  Nothing beats ending your meal with a Smile   Rating: Don't Miss  Price: $ (6-8 dollars per lunch entree)",

However, the service and salad bar at this particular ENP is usually sub-par: long wait times once seated, unfilled ketchup bottles, missing ice tea spoons, sad looking items on the salad bar, missing items on the salad bar (filling space with whole oranges doesn't count!), burned soups, etc.  If it wasn't for the existence of a salad bar and the location, I'd go to Denny's.",

Eat 'n' Park blows Denny's and King's out of the water in terms of quality.  Now, that doesn't mean that it's the best food ever! It's still diner food, and some of it is still going to feel cheapish.  BUT their shredded pot roast is excellent, their steak and cheese isn't very Philly, but is very tasty, and I rarely have a bad server here.  If you want some eats and a bottomless cup of coffee, seek out an Eat 'n' Park!",

I have to say it is nothing too exciting, but it is a solid meal. While in Pittsburgh (from Cincinnati) visiting my brother, we initially went to IHOP (which I was pretty disappointed in because we can go to IHOP anywhere).   The IHOP was in a brand new development, with a huge parking lot, and a 45 minute wait. Luckily we decided to ditch IHOP and go to Eat n' Park two minutes away. There was no wait; it was not crowded at all, and it was part of a nice business district that reminded me of Northside in Cincinnati (somewhat, though not quite as cool).  I would have liked to go to a truly local restaurant (not a chain) in Pittsburgh for our last meal before leaving, but it was better than IHOP.   I don't really understand the name though. Shouldn't it be Park n' Eat? Oh well.",

My cheeseburger was so bad that I didn't even bring the leftovers home for my dog. The meat was like rubber and the patties were so small you had to hunt to find them. My daughter had the chicken fingers and they were definitely a frozen product because they were chewy. The service was just terrible. They had 15 empty tables when we arrived and they couldn't find a place to put a party of 6 and made us wait. Our server was sweet but she was definitely overworked and had too many tables at once to wait on. I feel bad for the staff as you can just tell they aren't treated well. They are overworked and underpaid. Our dishes weren't cleared and we had to wait 15 minutes for our check. My daughter loved the free cookie and loved the coloring paper they provide but that was the only positive.",

We offered to buy her food from this Eat n Park and she gladly accepted. We took her into this restaurant which we have been many times the hostess greeted us with a smile and sat the women. My husband and I waited in the lobby. We told the hostess we weren't eating there but to let the lady order whatever she wanted and we would pay for it. The lady not knowing told the hostess instead of the waitress what she wanted ( two 5 piece chicken tender meals) which was fine with us she was hungry and we assumed she would have some for later. The hostess then told the waitress what the women wanted and the waitress screams \"SHE WANTS 2 MEALS!!!!\" Loudly in front of us. She was saying it so rude it was unbelievable. Who cares what the poor lady wants?? We were paying for it so my husband said to the hostess I can't believe that your waitress is acting like that it is so inappropriate and so rude just because that lady is down and out you do not have to treat her any differently we are paying for her meal not the waitress so why does it matter what she gets? The hostess promised us she would get good service and I hope she did.",

    "text": "Come here on a Saturday about 9:30pm.  Order the soup and salad bar because I was not all that hungry, and I wanted the chili.   First of all, I stand to get seated for about 5 minutes.  Then the hostess takes me to the table.  5 more minutes and not a waiter/waitress in sight.  Finally the hostess  comes to get my drink order, and I order the soup and salad bar.  She tells me I can go up.   First thing I see is that there are no spoons or serving implements on many of the buffet dishes. A few salad plates, and a few cups for the soups.  But there is chili. So I make a salad with the few serving implements there, and get a bowl of chili.   First off, the chili was hot.  Not seasoning wise...temperature wise.  Ok.  But I was able to eat just two spoons of it.  It tasted like someone dumped ten pounds of salt in it.  Inedible.  I then noticed them taking everything off the buffet.  No one said the buffet was closing, or that they were changing it.  And while serving myself, this mysterious unknown waiter brought me this flat Coke.  So you can't get more soup...or salad...and I look at the buffet on the way out of the restaurant, and they just brought out fruit....and no serving spoons.  You kidding me??? So I eat my salad and the hostess comes over and says \"Has your waiter been over?\" I answer \"Who would that be?\".  She runs off to find this person.  Finally another waitress comes over.  I order another Coke.  Never offered anything else, and I was still hungry. Another ten minute wait to get the check.  I paid, and I left a $ 1.00 tip.  Hopefully some ghost that works there got that.  Because I will be dead before I think of coming back.   I used to like Eat n' Park.  But these last few trips to their restaurants make me think they are not long for this world if they keep this up.  Good thing that Speedway Cafe was open so I could get some real food in me.",

I had the idea that they had low quality food, for some reason, but I thought, 'why not, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.' Unfortunately I wasn't. The food was either almost unseasoned (fish, fries) or too salty (garlic bread, pasta). Some of the side broccoli florets tasted off. Service was so-so (one of the guests at our table got the wrong order). Food is maybe a bit cheaper than other restaurants in the area but it's also very cheap quality.

If you are looking for a restaurant with an artful aesthetic, beautifully and creatively presented food, and fresh and locally sourced ingredients, you came to the wrong place.   However, what you do get out of Eat'n Park is very friendly and efficient service, a large menu with a ton of options, very reasonable prices, awesome late-night hours while most other places are closed, and being able to use college dining dollars (for CMU students) to pay. All in all, EnP is a very solid choice when looking for inexpensive food after a long night.",

I'm not sure if the Waterfront EnP is the first one with the new design, but it is somewhat similar to that one. However, they've tried add some local Squirrel HIll color. For example, they have pictures of the neighborhood on all of the walls.. They also have the very trendy garage door front to open up on nice days. The tables and chairs are definitely a step up from what they had previously, and the fireplace is a nice touch (even if I've never seen them use it). The bathrooms have also been spiffed up, which is nice. Overall it feels a little nicer and \"lighter\" inside.  You won't mistake EnP for a trendy restaurant but this redesign is definitely an improvement from the rather drab environment previously.  The food? Well, it's Eat n' Park, so there you go. We generally have good service at this one, although we've gotten to know some of the waitstaff which helps.",

The waffles melted in my mouth like the butter melted on top of them. The thick milkshake made me feel like I was drinking an Oreo. If you love Oreos as much as I do I would highly recommend this one. Although it did get a little too sweet for me by the end of it. Hey, sharing is caring and what are friends for?

    "text": "I haven't been to the E'n P in awhile, but I used to come here about once a month with a Meetup group on Sun. evenings for dinner.  I've been here both before and after the remodel, and I agree with other reviewers that, though the place looks snazzier, the food hasn't improved.  Service has always been friendly, if slow.  If you're looking for basic diner fare or late night munchies, the E'n P fits the bill well.  Having said that, you can tell that most of the food here is frozen or straight out of a container.  I've never ordered any of the breakfast specials, which seem to be quite popular, but I have ordered sandwiches and entrees, and they've all been pretty salty and flavorless, akin to cafeteria food.  The salad bar is usually a pretty safe bet, and the one thing they seem to get right is the potato soup, which comes with it.  Thinking that diner desserts are usually good even if the food isn't that great, I once tried a slice of strawberry cream pie once at the Waterfront location, but unfortunately, it failed to impress me, being of similar quality to the food.  E'n P is a great place to come with kids, older relatives, large groups that include picky eaters, and drunk people.  Other than that, you'd do well to pass it up and explore the plethora of better and more interesting dining options in the neighborhood. 2.5 stars, only because I think the smiley cookies are cute.",

This ENP is really easily accessible by the public buses that go from CMU to Squirrel Hill.    Granted, this ENP is kinda old and could use some re-decorating (it feels like a blast from the past) but if you want OK/decent diner food for OK/decent prices, ENP is an option... I think some of their food was kinda greasy, and I remember a sandwich was that positively drowned in gravy.  I do recall that their shakes are actually pretty good.  I remember getting one that was mocha and it had an espresso bean on top of the whipped cream.  Totally didn't sleep that day.  Their smiley cookies are also good here too.  They're just plain sugar cookies with icing on the top and their silly face drawn on it - I mean you could get these iced cookies in the supermarket too but don't you want the smiley?  So happy!",

    "text": "I personally don't really understand why so many people like to hate on this place so much. Sure the food isn't the best quality, but in my opinion American diner food is not usually worth raving about to begin with. Add this to the fact that most such places serve you oversized portions with higher prices than ENP, and I find ENP to be a much more solid choice, especially in a city where everything is closed by 10pm.  That said, ENP is a good (read: ONLY) place to go when it's late at night and you're starving at home with no food in your fridge. They have a midnight menu which is pretty extensive, including comfort food appetizers, brunch omelettes and toast, burgers, salads, and a few dinner items. Mostly quite decent. I especially like the fact that portions are not plus-sized, with prices scaled proportionally. In addition, you have a choice of sides for most things.  Service is okay. For late night when there are fewer people, the servers are usually more attentive. Wait times for food can vary, which is a mystery as it was never crowded when we came here.  Have never tried their famous smiley cookies, but I have tried their pies and I can say that they're delightful.",

One of the times I went I got the super griddle and the waffle just tasted like plain batter, but in a chalky way. This time I got the steak salad and it was huge! It comes with fries, cucumbers, and tomatoes in it with garlic bread on the side. The steak was like shredded rather than pieces of a slab like I originally thought. It was good with ranch dressing.",

I ordered off of the all day breakfast menu and everything was tasty! I love the waffles at  EatN' Park, there food is pretty consistent.   This is always one of the best spots to stretch your dollar and fill your belly. I have had a couple bad experiences at EatN' Park's across the Burgh, but the Squirrel Hill location is always good.

    "text": "By no means am I a picky eater, and going into Eat'n Park for their all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch buffet, I was not expecting some Wolfgang Puck level cuisine. With that being said, the food, in my opinion, was tolerable but mediocre at best. Variety wise, there were your breakfast basics (eggs, biscuits, potatoes, sausage, bacon, and pancakes), a salad/salad bar, fruit, pierogies, mini muffins, etc. As anyone would expect, the quality of the food left much to be desired. I could deal with the overcooked eggs and soggy potatoes, but the employees seemed completely oblivious when it came time to restock the buffet. Half the time, there were no clean plates to use. Although they didn't do a great job at managing the buffet while it was brunch time, they were VERY punctual when it came to tearing it down at exactly 2pm. I blinked and half the food was being wheeled back to the kitchen. I dove for the last few muffins I could get my hands on.  Our waitress was a rockstar though. Super friendly and made sure buffet items were refilled after I told her they were empty. She delivered fresh pancakes right to my table once they were finally made - customer service at its finest.   I'm rating this place 2 stars not only for the overall quality of the food but for the experience that came with it. Nonetheless, $9.99 for an all-you-can-eat breakfast is still a very good deal.",

The server comes over, brings water, and states she will be back soon. Another 10 minutes and we order the buffet and I add a waffle with sides of whipped cream and strawberries (I was watching a lot of Parks and Rec and I had a craving).   5-10 minutes later we ask the waitress if we can take the lids off of the buffet that is still half full and not uncovered yet. She states she is unsure, but will find out for us. At around 12:30, my friend gets up and starts taking kids off of the buffet. Other customers and myself get up and start filling our plates.  The buffet looks okay. I spot waffles, which I did not know they offered on the buffet, and I'm a little annoyed I ordered a side waffle without the waitress telling me that they were already on the buffet. Everything I get from the buffet is mediocre. I can't even decide if I'm mad about he waffles because they were the best thing I had all night.   It takes us longer than usual to get our check and we're not sure why. The server seems a little frazzled, but it's not that busy and there doesn't seem to be a lot going on at 1am. I make a comment about not realizing the buffet already serves waffles when I ordered, and she states that the buffet didn't have waffles with strawberries and whipped cream and I pay the extra $7 the waffle. I feel disappointed, but also somewhat uncomfortable as I speed walk out of the Eat'n Park and the whole awkward experience.",

We thought we were going to a buffet. Great! We love the occasional buffet! When we arrived and saw exactly what we were working with we were a little confused and disappointed but still decided to stay and try it since it came highly recommended by a couple locals. I ordered the Reuben with the salad bar as my side, my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the salad bar as HIS side, and we got the toddler blueberry pancakes with lots of extra turkey sausage.   The salad bar is actually really good! lol. I had two full plates of salad before I had to push my plate away so I could leave room for my sandwich. My husband enjoyed the salad bar less so, but I have a soft spot for salad bars so whatever. The Reuben was better than I was expecting: piping hot with lots of meat- a solid effort for a diner chain. My husband had no complaints about his sandwich and my son put as big a dent in his food as he is capable of.  Overall, the experience was just decent. A solid three stars, but in a positive light. I can see this being somewhere I'd drunkenly stumble into back in the days way before the toddler but I can't see myself making special trips here as someone who needs the food I pay for when I eat out to be worth every penny I spend. Nothing bad to say about this location, per se, just nothing to write home about either.",

    "text": "I have enough reviews about EnP that you guys know we usually have hit or miss food &/or service after trying multiple locations.. so much that my fiance refuses any EnP anymore.   I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this location. I've been here atleast 5 times in the last 3 years. Anywayssss, my sister and I stopped in yesterday for dinner. I was craving something specific from another spot, but i knew my picky sister wouldn't find too many things at that place appetizing.. so i decided on EnP.   Our server was Ali (I believe) and she was so sweet! Seriously i could say that 10 times!   Our food however was mediocre. I ordered the herb crusted chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy and a salad. My sister ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with a salad. We ordered mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini for apps. Our appetizers were so beyond greasy. I totally get that they are fried foods, but i mean these were drenched it grease. The zucchini breading fell off bc of how wet it was, ugh. My sister's buffalo chicken wrap didnt have buffalo sauce in it (?!!?!?!?!) The roll my dinner was served with was old and hard. I'm not one to complain in reviews but these were silly kitchen mistakes that shouldn't have happened.   I'll stick to 3 stars just because the service was great and i know i'll be back at some point, even though I know Bobby most likely will not join, lol.",

The service is pretty meh, the food is pretty meh and the portions are worse than meh. It's just a meh experience and sort of expensive if you think about it.   So with this location, everything has gone down hill since my first visit. The service is absolutely terrible, the food again is mediocre and it's just not a great experience.   Last time i ordered take out, I sat for 45 minutes before I even received my food. Now anyone that knows me, that I am pretty much non-confrontational. But I was hangry and it was late. No apologies, nothing from them other than here is your food. Yeah, I could have gone somewhere else, eaten and been home in the time I waited for my burger.

Great for breakfast and cool specials both for breakfast and lunch. The parking is on the street which can be an issue but you're inSquirrel Hill so that's the deal almost everywhere.  First thing noticed was the cleanliness of the restaurant. We were quickly seated. Our beverages were ordered and quickly brought over. Our waitress was friendly , pleasant and knowledgeable when we asked questions.  Our food was very good and they have some really cool items on the menu and the food is exactly what it says it's going to be. We usually make this our \"go to\" breakfast place every time we are visiting our daughter on Pittsburgh but getting a really decent burger and terrific shake is also happening on occasion. The prices are great, especially for Pittsburgh, and you always know what to expect.  I know the Yelp reviews are kinda all over the place but we have been doing Eat'n Parks for years and it's good for us every time so far.  Also giving a 10% veteran discount for the month of November and that gets kudos from my wife & I who are both veterans and lifetime members of Amvets",

The mushroom burger tasted pretty good, though I didn't like their choice in bun and the actual burger was pretty small. The pies they have are amazing though. In fact, I think their desserts in general are really really good.   Don't think you'd expect top of the line quality and hygiene at a super late night diner, so there's that, but it's nothing too extreme.  Service was a little slow (waited 45+ minutes for food, but it was also like 2 AM), but everyone was extremely nice.   All in all, it's ok. There's definitely better, but it gets the job done.",

He loves the Smiley Cookie. He loves the kids menu. This is why I think that EnP gets as many 4 and 5 star reviews as it gets: people ate there as children and nostalgia drives them to rate highly.   The food is fine. EnP is a diner. You can go in and get good breakfast food (but there are better options). You can go in and get a good burger or sandwich (but again there are better options). And they have some great desserts (but, wait for it, there are better options).   I have had numerous friends (all non-native Pittsburghers) act surprised when EnP's non-diner food is lackluster. (Is anyone really surprised that EnP doesn't make a great quesadilla?) If you're going, stick to the basics.   My issue with the Murray Ave restaurant is the service. While there are servers that we absolutely love, it takes unreasonable amounts of time for food to arrive. My son and I waited 30+ minutes for a chicken sandwich and pancakes at a time when the restaurant was less than half-full. When we first started patronizing the Murray Ave location (2016) service was quick, but since mid-2017 the pace seems painfully slow. Did management change? Is the kitchen that understaffed?",
