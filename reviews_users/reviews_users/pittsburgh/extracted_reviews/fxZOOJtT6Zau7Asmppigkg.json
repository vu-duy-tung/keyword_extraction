Do they deserve a 1-star rating for a botched delivery order?  Probably not.  We've ordered from Potenza a few times in the past and have been pleased.  However,  I'm sure that establishments like this have a high turnover rate with employees,  so the service and food quality may vary widely over a range of time.   I guess best you can hope for from reviews like this one is to gain an accurate snapshot of the business at a particular point in time.      So, currently,  it is a 1-star.   There is nothing worse than waiting 30-45 minutes for delivery and then the order is wrong.    Calling them back and yelling at them does nobody any good.  Calling and asking them to fix their mistake doesnt work because you are starving and dont want to wait another 30-45 minutes for the corrected order to arrive. So the only thing to do is turn to Yelp and hope you can effect some change that way.  I'll probably give Potenza another shot some time in the distant future when I can be reasonably sure that the people who screwed up my order last night no longer work there.",

The naan was a 6\" piece of Pizza dough with some seasoning, didn't taste like anything at all, more dried out and hard from being sent thru the oven.  The chicken was probably the best out of the mix grill.  I'd have to say the 3 pieces of 4 beef were the worst.  Dry, nuked, over cooked etc.  I am going to end this review early.

So I called back asking for a refund, the man was very rude and said the driver was on his way. The driver called me and asked me to come outside, I did, he SPED up to me, I seriously thought he was gonna hit me! Handed me my food and sped away.

As a Pittsburgh native and a college student in the region, I have tried my share of pizza joints and have ultimately settled on Potenza as my go to pizza order.    A personal anecdote about the service:  I live close enough to Potenza that I can bike to pick up my order.  Once when strapping my order to the back of my bike, and employee came out and offered to drive my order to my apartment free of charge.  After I declined, they helped me secure my order and wished me well.  I wouldn't go to a pizza joint on centre avenue expecting the fine dining and service of a French Restaurant, but never have I had a negative experience with the employees there.",

Their specialty pies, such as Meat Lover's and Hawaiian, are all delicious.  They have a huge menu, but I'm probably not going to explore it any time soon (the pizza is too good to give up).  Maybe you need kabobs, pasta, gyro, or calzones (very good) in your life.  Potenza will satisfy these cravings.

When the order arrived the driver refused to even enter the hotel lobby. When i arrived back to my room, not only was the food cold, ALL of the sauces were missing. Unfortunately the hotel did not have marinara or ranch that I could purchase. I called the restaurant and asked if they could send the sauces. The man who answered the phone stated he would send them as soon as a driver arrived back. 20 minutes went by and it was my first meal of the day, so I just ate the food. I called the restaurant back to ask them to cancel the missing items as they were no longer needed. A different man answered the phone and rudely told me to wait. He handed the phone to yet another gentleman who the proceeded to call me a liar and began to scream at me stating they were never actually going to deliver the missing sauces as I had been lying about them not being in the box the entire time. I would never order here again. The boneless wings were way over cooked and spongy and the breadsticks were bland and tough. They also definitely need to work on customer support.",

At the bottom of the receipt it says, \"Collect 10 Different Receipts To Receive Free Med Cheese Pizza\".  If you were to order the above items individually you would end up paying an additional $6.17 so if you have a coupe of people that are hungry and you can agree on what type of hoagie to split, this is a decent solution.    As far as the food, it's average.  The breadsticks are good but there's never enough butter / garlic / cheese on them.  The pizza is good but you can taste that the sauce is canned - I only know of two pizza shops in the city that actually makes their own sauce (and that doesn't mean opening the can and pouring it into a bowl).  I wish they would offer a salad instead of the hoagie because there are times when I am burned out on the same two or three hoagies that are actually cooked right and don't arrive a soggy mess.",

Also ordered a slice of Raspberry cheesecake.)  Delivery came at 1:51pm.  Everything I ordered was there.   Visual inspection:  Comes with pita not bread! Definitely a plus for me. Could tell immediately the french fries were just your standard cheap frozen fries. Nothing special and not what I prefer.  Fish looked ok, nothing special, cheesecake looked fine. Didn't even see the tiny container of cole slaw til I started eating.  Taste:   Catfish was your typical frozen fishy taste. Breading had no flavor whatsoever. Threw it on the pita with some tarter & hot sauce and tasted a lot better. You get no lemon at all. Guess they prefer to save money and still charge $11.99. Fries as stated, just your average frozen. Not a fan of them. Ended up covering them with franks hot sauce & ranch & they were good that way lol. Cole slaw was probably the most disgusting cole slaw I've ever eaten in my entire life, & I love some good slaw. Being thrown in with the fish & fries it was just warm mush. Cheesecake wasn't bad. Probably would of been better if I threw it back in the fridge since it came hot sitting on my food container.  All in all, it felt like an average diy dinner purchased from Aldis. Edible but nothing was beyond ok. (no offense to Aldis) The menu here is just ridiculous. Probably the longest pizza place menu I've ever seen in my life. Being a fan of kitchen nightmares it makes me think to that. The more you offer the more you skimp on quality ingredients. Think restaurants like Red Lobster & Olive Garden have smaller menus.  Will definitely order again & try something different. 2 star review off one order isn't really fair but I'll edit it later based off future purchases.  12/13 edit: Was going to order an x-large specialty pizza & was looking for extra ranch. Really, on your 900 item menu I can't order a few extra? Get with it. Yeah, it's stupid & I could call but that's the point of online ordering. I don't have to. Something so simple & I'll order my $20 pizza somewhere else tonight.",

    "text": "To say anything else but delicious about the food here would be a lie.  I ordered a smoked turkey wrap and could not have been happier.  Instead of using a tortilla like most places do, they used a pita...a nice fresh pita, yum!  The turkey was moist, bacon was salty, tomatoes were nice sized slices and lettuce was crisp.  What pulled it all together was the honey mustard dressing (packaged, but still good).    Only downside I had with it was that it was to come with a side of cole slaw and a pickle spear.  Pickle spear was lacking and tiny.  Cole slaw was nonexistent.  Maybe next time they will get it right.",

    "text": "Potenza is the new favorite pizza place to order from for my wife and I. We've tried numerous places over the last year, and Potenza seems to be the most consistent for quality.  My favorite hoagie is chicken parm, as I order one almost every time we call in an order to any pizza shop. I guess you could say that's what I use to compare. I have to say that even if the pizza was awful, I'd at least be calling Potenza to order their chicken parm hoagie! It's that good. Large pieces of breaded chicken, good sauce, and a nice balance of cheese that isn't too overwhelming. Not to mention the large is big enough to feed a few people...or one of me.  Fortunately, the pizza is really good, as well. We've only had cheese, and recently tried the white pizza. Is it the best plain cheese pizza in Pittsburgh? Nope (our nod goes to Fiori's), but you're not going to have any complaints. It's very good for your run-of-the-mill pizza place in town, a la Milano's or Parma, and the white pizza was excellent!  The other great thing has been the delivery. We seem to get a call from every delivery person - regardless of who we order from - asking about where our place is. Potenza's drivers seem to be the nicest ones we've had to deal with.  In short, if you're looking for a pizza joint with consistent quality and service, Potenza is a safe bet...and seriously...best chicken parm hoagie that I've found more recently in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Ordered a cheese quesadilla for delivery and they gave me a chicken one which I didn't find out about until biting into it. I don't eat chicken and so when I told them I got told that they would send another one over. When I told them I just wanted my money back because the chicken made me feel sick, they told me the cheese quesadilla was on its way already (we had been speaking on the phone for maybe four minutes at this point). After a few more minutes of the manager being rude and defensive over the phone, I just hung up. The cheese quesadilla arrived at my house almost an hour later.  Tldr; mediocre food, overpriced, and terrible service. Only decent thing about them is the cheap delivery fee of $1.",

They were quick, the pizza was cooked to perfection (I'm a basic cheese pizza gal so this was by no means a crazy specialty pizza), and my hubby's chicken parm hoagie was both ginormous and scrumptious (he said it has been a while since he had had one that good).  Great combo specials on the pizza/hoagie too!  I highly recommend giving this place a shot!",

    "text": "I almost never leave reviews. I just received an incorrect order. Whatever ... Too hungry to care. As soon as I bite into it... It is inedible. Doughy. Seriously? I call back and ask that they send the driver back because at this point it is late, I'm exhausted, my appetite is gone and I just want my damn money back. He reluctantly says ok and agrees to send driver back. One hour later - no driver, no phone calls ... Just a gross uncooked pizza. I called but of course they are not answering. This is a wonderful introduction to Pittsburgh. I've been on a plane all day, I'm starving and this is the experience. One star for getting my soda order right. This is not how you run a business.  Update: I called this morning to ask about my refund. They said that I could come in and get my refund. No. I'm from out of town w/o a rental. So the money I would spend on a Lyft would completely defeat the purpose. I asked that they send a driver to return my money. They did about an hour later. I gave them the entire uncooked pizza back. But of course I didn't get my tip back. Whatever.",
