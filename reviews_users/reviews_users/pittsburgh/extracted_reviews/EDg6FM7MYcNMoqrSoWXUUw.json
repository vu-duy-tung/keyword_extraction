We ordered takeout for a group of 7, lots of different preferences with toppings, etc. Everything was correct, and they took the time to label the check and each meal with corresponding numbers so we could easily figure out which meals belonged to whom and how much money we owed. Specifically enjoyed the brisket taco and the hot sauce is incredible! Can't wait to make this a regular takeout spot and I'm so happy Bloomfield has a taco place!",

The first time we got there during their posted hours and had to wait for them to show up and open the restaurant late(so unprofessional).  We didn't wait around and just decided to go to Thai Cuisine down the street.  The second time me and my lady made plans to go and decided to call first.  They said, sorry we are not open because we are doing a catering event.  I think this was the reason why they were late opening the first time.  I am never going there again.  First of all they have strange hours to begin with and second of all they can't even keep those hours.  Why bother going if you don't know if they will be open, or not?  You can't run a catering business with the same staff you run the restaurant with and expect to have regular hours.  It pisses me off because I do like the food.",

I had the brisket, chicken, and chorizo tacos. My partner in crime had two vegetable tacos; which She liked. They were very tasty and the prices were good. The venue doesn't really have seating but you can stand and eat at the window. I look forward to coming back for the buffalo cauliflower and barbecue mushroom tacos. The service was fast and friendly. The brisket was my favorite so far. I give it a 4.5 and my co-diner gave it a 3.5.  Upon further review of a second trip, I have to bump my score up to a 5.0. The tacos were even better this time.",

I lived in Arizona for a while so my standards are high, but he wasn't toying with me. It was easily the best burrito I've had in Pittsburgh and possibly one of the best I've ever had.

    "text": "There are many things to love about BLT, but the first is not even about their tacos (which are amazing). The first time I came into the shop-- it's located inside Jim's Wraps and Salads in Bloomfield-- I was greeted warmly by Steve, who runs the counter and genuinely connects with everyone walking into the place, asking their names and learning more about how they found out about BLT. He also recalls the regulars by name and helps promote a sense that this is a neighborhood restaurant that cares about its patrons. It's personal touches like these that set BLT apart and truly embody the essence of \"Pittsburgh nice\" (which is totally a thing).   I ordered a chicken taco and a side of guac and chips, and all were completely delicious and had the authentic Mexican flavor I was hoping for. My only reasoning for not giving it a full 5 stars is due to the wait, since it's a small set-up and during peak hours-- I went right after 6pm when it had opened-- lots of people are waiting for their tacos to be prepared by Zach, and this can take nearly 20 minutes. On the flip side, Steve is there to talk with everyone who comes in and helps you forget about the wait time entirely!  The shop runs on a donation basis, if paying with cash, or you can use a card and indicate how much you are paying. I love this idea and feel like it again embodies the sense of it being a family-style neighborhood staple that you want to be generous towards in order to keep it going.",

    "text": "Location: 1.5/10. The entire establishment is about the size of a large office cubicle. Standing room only with a little bar top type area where you can eat. I went with the take out route since I like sitting and eating. One thing that sucks is that there isn't a nice park nearby where you could eat outside in the summer months.  Price: 7/10. For 10$ you get three large tacos that are densely packed. Pretty good bang for your buck. Appearance of the Taco: 4/10. Let's just say these tacos look far from gourmet but I've seen worse. You can judge for yourself from the picture. Taste: 5/10. This is where I was extremely disappointed, after following them on Instagram I saw that over the last week they have continuously sold out of tacos like they were tacos from the gods. I honestly didn't think they were that good. They were large and Densely packed but the taste just wasn't there. The best part was the hot sauce that I had asked for. If it wasn't for the hot sauce I think it would of fallen in the 3.5 out of 10 range. One note, I do love the addition of the lime. Like the little citrus kick there.  Overall rating: 5/10.  Would I go back yes, would I go out of my way to go back, no I would not. Maybe I am spoiled when it comes to tacos but it just wasn't there for me. The hype did not live up to the actual thing. As it stands the best tacos in the city of Pittsburgh in order: 1. Tako 2. Smoke 3. Bakersfield 4. Condados 5. Baby loves tacos 6. Doce taqueria.",

I ordered a brisket taco and I swear the chef must have used a whole jar of chili powder to cook the meat.  That was the only thing I could taste in the taco.  It was overpowering.   Maybe the chicken or veggie would be a better option next time.  As one of the few counter service places in Bloomfield I'm willing to give it another try.  But steer clear of the brisket unless you like your meat extremely (and I mean extremely) seasoned",

I was thrilled to hear one was moving into the space previously occupied by Jim's Wraps and Salads, which didn't last long. I stopped by one of their soft openings with my boyfriend and we got the chorizo and pulled pork tacos. They were fantastic. The pork had such a nice complex flavor with cumin and cinammon, with nice big slices of avocado. The chorizo was bright red and full of flavor, perfectly spicy all on corn tortillas. The owner was very nice and I like how he fixed the place up, knowing what it used to be. We will be back again very soon!",

It's take out only so be prepared to find a spot to eat elsewhere because the fabulous smells will drive you crazy. I will go back again my chorizo burrito was amazing.",

I was born and raised in central California, so I basically have hot sauce for blood and I'm sure at least one organ is actually a burrito.  Here's how my experience went down.   Reading the wall menu, the dude at the counter becomes obviously annoyed at me not knowing immediately what I wanted.  (Awesome.)  I ask what the veggie special is and he points to another sign.  HEY PITTSBURGH, USE YOUR DAMN WORDS.   I forget that it's really cool to be uppity for no reason around here, so I move on.  I blurt out something resembling an order and wait.   I dive into the burrito in my car because I just got off a 13 hour shift and damn it, I deserve a car burrito.   Bite one. HOLY.  %*$@!!  This is the best tortilla I have had since leaving CA.  I'm getting really pumped.  Next bite.  WOOOAH this Smokey hot sauce is damn good, DAMN GOOD.  Third bite. Plain white rice.  Ok odd choice whatever.  \"BBQ mushroom\"...crunch.  Ouch.  Mushrooms shouldn't have mega crunchy parts.   No extra charge for guac...because it tastes like green water.  The only positives were the tortilla and the chipotle hot sauce.  The rest was incredibly disappointing.   I'll deal with uppity people in the food world if the product is damn good.  I thought I'd give it another shot, but the fact of me running to the toilet as soon as I got home is going to prevent that from happening.",

My chicken and roasted carrot ones were ok but nothing worth traveling for or compared to multiple other places.  As for my girlfriend's meal, she ordered a salad with chicken and her chicken was not pulled or shredded,  it was just a giant piece of somewhat tough thigh or breast.  What?  Lastly, I know most of the business is take out so this shouldn't matter, but spring for some AC.  It felt 110 degrees when we were in there.  Update, the owner reached out and due to his great customer service I am definitely going to give them another try.  I love local business and wish them the best and will certainly update when I try again.  Not for me, but clearly others dig it.  I guess difference of opinion makes the world go round.",

I don't know why anyone would mind that when the tacos are so good.  There are only six tacos to choose from, and I always think that when a shop makes a choice to limit a menu that way it's brave but really smart.  Brave, because of all the people who think they need more choices.  Those people are missing out because a limited menu allows the chef to really lean in and excel on a smaller list.  And sure enough, each of the tacos that came out were exceptional.   I had a chorizo, brisket, and barbecued mushroom.  They all were great but I have to say the mushroom taco flavors simply exploded for me.  The veggie options all looked incredible.  Baby Loves Tacos is really one of the more vegetarian friendly places around--50% of the offerings were veggie.  Respect.  Baby Loves Tacos is worth an extended trip to get there.  Don't let this pass you but.  Support Baby Loves Tacos!  PS. how can this be rated $$?  Three tacos that fill you up for $10.  That is a deal.",

I left a tip that the hours now are Tuesday 6-9pm. It's actually daily unless shop is closed to work an event. Definitely a take away joint but there's counter seating for three. It's a small walkup space and that's a-ok with me. Decor is fun and makes me feel like I'm in the chef's personal kitchen. So on this visit we had tacos. Next up for us will be bowls, salads, burritos and chips/salsa. I had the chicken taco, Brian had a mushroom taco and a fish taco and we shared one made of chorizo. This food absolutely blew us away!!! So delish, you guys! I love that we were asked if we liked our food spicy and when we said yes just the right amount of hot sauce was added for the perfect kick. My chicken taco came with avocado, homemade pico, cheese, and cilantro. Mushroom taco had barbecued mushrooms and cheese. Fish taco came with a creamy chipotle sauce, pickled cabbage and avocado. Chorizo had cheese, pico, avocado, cilantro. All served on corn tortillas. Reasonably priced-comparable to other local taco spots.  I sat there literally getting dizzy and my head was spinning because the flavors were that overwhelming tasteful. It was difficult stopping myself from ordering more. The owner/chef and his mom are super nice, friendly and we got to talk about the business he had in Philly and all he plans to do here---he's opening a place in Bellevue too. Definitely worth checking out. Trust me.",

We decided to get the three taco deal (can't remember how much, but it was a reasonable price). There were tons of options for the meat and you could load it up with all kinds of toppings. The tacos were absolutely fantastic. They must put a hint of Chipotle sauce in the taco, but it really added the perfect flavor to the brisket and the chicken. Highly recommend. I must also mention that Kat was very friendly, shared the story of the place, and helped us order the perfect taco. Thanks!",

Having kids and a small business is time consuming and being a busy mother myself I totally get it . With that said , the food is fresh, flavorful and the place is well kept and clean . Definitely coming back here again and again !",

They were at an event I was attending and so I grabbed a beef and a fish taco. Coming from someone who hasnt had a ton of tacos, I thought they were incredible. My issue is that the place isn't really open, it's sort of open but not and a lot of times they say they will be fully open soon, but then soon comes and it's still not really open. That's the only reason I went down a star.",

(It was the buffalo cauliflower taco that pushed me over the edge to drive to Bloomfield!)  The small shop doesn't offer seats but has some standing area to enjoy your tacos. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower and a chicken taco to try two different kinds (tacos are 3 for $10 or 1 for $4). Both were very good! While ordering I heard my two favorite questions... \"Do you want guac? and Would you like it spicy?\" Yes and YES!   The quick trip was worth it - they were spicy, flavored well, and the cauliflower was a great change! I'll be back soon!",

Figured I had to go with the tacos given the name of the place, got the 3/$10 which I thought was a pretty good deal. They had 4 vegetarian options and 4 meat options, something for everyone. I had the buffalo cauliflower, carne asada and chorizo. You then have a lot of great options as far as dressings (cilantro, red slaw, jalapenos, etc.). One thing that I did not like was how greasy the proteins were, all three really. The tortillas just kind of fell apart because of the grease. Not a big deal, make sure you have a fork because if not I'd imagine things would get rather messy. But good flavors overall. Added the chips and salsa for $3, their salsa has a pretty nice kick to it. Staff was friendly. Worth checking out for sure.",

One of my least favorite things about Baby Loves Tacos is that the carne asada is not really carne asada. The meat is extremely ground up for some reason even though the flavor may remotely resemble carne asada. They have a lot of interesting toppings, but I got possibly too many of the pickled toppings and made the burrito taste way too acidic. All in all, BLT is a nice alternative to Chipotle if you're feeling a little more adventurous, but I'd still choose Chipotle 9 out of 10 times.",

    "text": "Baby Loves Tacos is now officially open. They opened 1-9-18. The only way I recognized the place was that they had a small folded sign near the door. They are in the process of changing the overhead sign.  When I went in I met Ryan the owner and asked him about that closure of the business I read in the paper about a week or so ago. He explained to me that matter had to do with an occupancy permit and there are no health violations associated with this business.  This place is basically a take out but they have a counter where you can stand if you prefer to eat in. I learned that they do catering both private and corporate. The menu isn't expansive but the prices are reasonable.  Ryan explained to me that everything except the burritos are gluten free and if you are a vegan, upon request, they can turn their vegetable taco into vegan. He suggested that I try 3 different tacos for my first visit. I went with the spicy brisket, the chicken, and the buffalo cauliflower. For my drink I ended up with a \"lime aid.\" Needless to say it was very good.  I got my food fairly quickly and then I noticed how many people poured in here just for lunch! These tacos were very good. The brisket was just a little tough but otherwise I enjoyed them. Let me also mention they were messy so I was grateful that they gave me plenty of napkins. It should be noted that under the main counter they have hooks where you can hang your purse. Made it convenient for me so I wouldn't mess it up while eating.  I wasn't at the window counter so I can't speak for that one.  Although they have other offering including salads you have your choice of the same five meats or vegetables to choose from. I was glad to have found this place. It is located on Liberty Ave in Bloomfield near Tessaro's. Paid metered parking is available or off street day parking if you are lucky to find it is available as well.  I was told they are open weekdays for lunch and dinner only. They are closed on Suns. Looking forward to trying out their other offerings on a future visit. Good food and great service!!",

I did the 3 for $10 and had the buffalo cauliflower, chorizo, and chicken with guac. Their menu is pretty limited, but with the amount of people there I knew it had to be good. There is no seating, but my friend and I were able to grab some space at the standing counter area. The decor of the place is cute with a lot of succulents and candles giving it a warm homey vibe.   The tacos were delicious. I love corn tortillas, so I was happy that their tacos each come with two corn tortillas. They load up the tacos with toppings such as salsas and cheese and give lime on the side. The buffalo cauliflower had a nice kick to it which I was not expecting. The chorizo was on the oily side, but tasty. After three tacos, I was pretty full. A perk was that the guac was no extra cost. Overall, a great place to grab some quality tacos. You truly can never have enough tacos. I will definitely be back to try some different proteins!",

I AM STILL THINKING ABOUT THE BACON TACO and my only regret was not ordering 2 of those along with the brisket. If you're hungry, I suggest you order 3 tacos. The tortillas were super delicious, and tasted fresher/softer than normal corn tortillas-- I'd love to know where they get them.   The owner is very kind and informative. He even told me to \"pay what I want\" and when I said $10 for two tacos (which I thought was reasonable) he only charged me $6 for the two.  I can't wait to come back and bring my friends!",

My significant other went with bacon, buffalo cauliflower , and chorizo which was also really good.

Have stopped by in the past but they were not open at the time I stopped due to just starting up and not having consistent hours during soft opening.  Finally open hours are listed on the website.  Yea!   Also, finally have signage.   Tried the 3 for $10 taco option.  Can't go wrong with any.  The Spicy Brisket just came out of the oven and was perfect.  The Chorizo was also tasty with a nice spicy flavor. The chicken was good but not as spicy.  If you are in the area and looking for a fast meal and tacos you should definitely stop in.  The tacos come with salsa, cilantro, lime, fresh tomato and you can get gauc.",

Baby Loves Tacos came back home from Philadelphia and had been setting up a pop-up for a while. \"You have to go check it out.\" \"It's worth the drive for such a legit taco.\" \"I've been craving Baby Loves Tacos for weeks since I last had it.\"  The rumors are True and Baby Loves Tacos lives up to the hype. You have to go check it out. It's worth the drive for such a legit taco. And, since trying it for the first time last week, I've been craving Baby Loves Tacos ever since.  We stopped in for the soft opening, and everything blew us away--we were particularly impressed by the sweet potato taco. The full menu will have burritos and bowls and most of my paycheck. Bloomfield is a great place for Italian flare, but an even better place for Baby Loves Tacos. As an added bonus, Zack is passionate and super nice and humble about how awesome his food is.  There are tons of places in the city to hop on the new taco craze, but there's only one Baby Loves Tacos. And Baby Loves Tacos is drivin' me crazy.",

I was hooked after the first time! Since then, it has become a frequent stop for me for a late lunch or dinner. I always get the 3 taco meal - and although I am a total carnivore..I am obsessed with EVERY one of their veg options for tacos. I usually end up with 3! The buffalo cauliflower is a must-have if you are only picking one veg option. I also love the mushrooms, carrots, and sweet potato [if available]. The brisket is also out of this world if it's available. You cannot go wrong with any filling though, truly! Follow their Instagram to stay up to date - because everything is SO fresh and made daily, sometimes certain things sell out.   It is extremely apparent that this business is a labor of love and passion from the owners. They are so thoughtful and intentional with every ingredient they offer  - and that is something I appreciate so much in a food service establishment. I have to eat GF and I can rely on Baby Loves Tacos for a quick, amazing, GF-safe meal, every time I go...and that is pretty major. A bonus is that the owner and his family are so nice - and the owner's mom often works the register and gives off the friendliest mom vibes! 5 Stars from me! 100%.",

It is a teeny tiny spot with no seating, just a window to order some wickedly good tacos and eat in your car like a slob... I mean, that's what I did. I have the stains to prove it.   The nicest guy ever was behind the counter and suggested I just trust him and he put together three tacos for me to try. I had the mushroom taco, which could have been my favorite... But maybe a tie with the chorizo and then the carne asada, which was also tasty. I believe some of the toppings were pickled onions and cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking of them!   I cannot wait to go back and will make this at least a monthly routine. I don't care if I have to eat them in my car and stain more clothes, it's happening!",

You might have to pull a quick u-turn to find that right spot but you're not going to run into a situation where you give up out of frustration.  Service: It's a small establishment with just two workers on this particular day. We showed up before any rush! Quick service all around!  Facilities: You can tell that there is a bit of a makeshift counter that they put in place. I'm certainly not one to judge considering the end product! There is really no available seating for patrons and most of their business is really just walk up. We managed to find an opening at the small picnic table just outside.  Food: Delicious! The nachos were on POINT and the carne asada burrito was legit.  Would absolutely visit this place again!",

I couldn't decide between the three meats they had so I got three tacos with ONE OF EACH... cod, carne asada, and chicken... each better than the last. They were loaded with fresh ingredients and absolutely delicious.  It's a very small joint with only room for two to sit out front if the weather is nice (we lucked into those seats). You basically walk-in order and take your food to-go. It's beyond reasonably priced (they LOAD those tacos up). I plan on coming back, again and again.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my wife for lunch.  We happened to be in the vicinity of Baby Loves Tacos whenever I remembered seeing it right on Liberty in Bloomfield.  So we headed on over without knowing what to expect.  Whenever we entered the space I was surprised by the fact that it was much smaller than I expected.  The whole inside consisted of a place to order your food and then a standing food bar that could fit maybe 6 people tightly.  Other than that there were some chalkboard menus up that showed you your choice of proteins and toppers and that's about it.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the 3 tacos while my wife went with a carne asada burrito bowl.  I chose a different protein for each of the tacos and went with the BBQ mushroom (ports & oyster), Buffalo cauliflower and Chicken.   Then for the toppings I decided on hot salsa, pickled red slaw, cheese.  All of my tacos ended up being pretty good and I think out of the bunch that the BBQ mushroom was my favorite because it had a good texture along with a nice smokiness to it.  That's not to say that the other two weren't good as they both were and I have to admit that I was impressed with the number of vegetarian options (4) that they offered.  In any case I also thought that the hot salsa added a nice little spice to the tacos while the slaw added some extra acidity.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our tacos and so I plan on bringing my dad here for lunch some afternoon.",

Fresh ingredients, decent prices, great presentation.   .. alright, so we all just tasted my brisket taco. I'm not even sure what exactly is on it because I told them to make me whatever, but the taste is fire!! The meat, the sauce.. the radishes.. dayuuuummm on my taste buds. Will definitely be back here... will update when my friends eat their tacos!   Also to note, they have a pay it forward wall.. you can pay it forward for someone who can't afford to pay, or be gifted with a free meal. Awesome idea.. and awesome people.

    "text": "I really wanted to like Baby Loves Tacos more than I did. I've been searching for a great taco place in Pittsburgh ever since moving here, and I'm not sure yet if Baby Loves Tacos makes that cut or satisfies that need. I got the chorizo, carrots, and buffalo cauliflower, while my wife got the mushrooms, carne asada, and chicken. We were also excited to see that they had guacamole that day, so we jumped on that offer and grabbed some (with chips!). We took our food to-go, but we could have found some counter space had we decided to stay.  Pros: - the filling options were very unique, and the tacos were packed to the brim - the veggies were delicious, especially with he addition of the pickled veggies (I can't remember what those were exactly). I'm generally a big meat eater, but the veggies were filling and satisfying - the food is clearly super fresh - the menu is completely flexible for different diets. They handled gluten free and dairy free without any problems  Cons: - the corn tortillas and tortilla chips aren't made in the store, which was a let down and detracted from the taco experience - the guacamole was good, but the size was disappointing for the cost, and the chips were pre-made and didn't enhance the guacamole - despite double layers of tortillas, the filling bled through all of my wife's tacos, making them very soggy, so she struggled to eat them normally  Overall: I'm definitely going to give Baby Loves Tacos another chance, if for no other reason than having more of the delicious veggie fillings. I might try a bowl or salad next time and avoid the tortilla issues altogether. Overall, a solid spot that I will visit again, but the search for the best tacos continues...",

    "text": "After hearing my friend rave about this place, we finally went yesterday and it was so delicious! The small storefront doesn't have seating but that doesn't stop the traffic flow. People came in before and after us. I ordered the three tacos for $10. One chorizo, one chicken, and one carne asada (grilled and sliced beef). The chorizo was my least favorite mainly because of all the grease, but it had pretty good flavor. The chicken however was my favorite. Perfectly grilled and with good flavor. The carne asada was decent, I probably wouldn't get it again. All added ingredients I got on each tasted delicious and fresh including the cilantro, pico de Gallo snd jack cheese. I know some people are like: why would you go to a taco place that has 'tacos' in the name for nachos? But I feel like these nachos would be fire so I'm gonna do me next time I walk into this little charming taco stand.",

Roasted carrot,  buffalo cauliflower, and rosemary potato are my go to in a taco or burrito. They sometimes even have breakfast for dinner!  YUM! It's a small, family owned business that is constantly perfecting every detail. Follow them on Instagram because sometimes they sell out. I definitely don't see this as a negative thing!  To me, it means they strive for freshness. Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "I strolled into Baby Loves Tacos this past Saturday for lunch after realizing it'd been far too long since I had a good taco.  I've seen friends post rave reviews about this place so I'm glad I finally got to try it for myself!  First things first, I didn't expect it to be so cozy inside... and when I say cozy, I mean this is a grab and go kinda joint. No tables for dining in, unless you opt to stand at the counter in the window and enjoy your tacos - which we did.  We were greeted warmly by two gentlemen who enthusiastically explained the two specials (one meat and one veg) as well as the other menu offerings.  Carnivores and vegetarians alike will find something to love here!  Three tacos and an order of carne asada nachos seemed like a good way to fill up the tank and try a decent variety of the menu.  The tacos are served in warm, double-shelled corn tortillas which is always a treat.  Especially when an establishment is as generous with packing in the fillings as Baby Loves Tacos.  First up was a chicken taco:  the chicken was tender and seasoned well.  Next was the carne asada, which was by far my favorite of the lot.  The meat was delicious, juicy, and had just the right kick of heat.  I was definitely glad we opted for the carne asada on our nachos too, because it was just that dang good. Last but not least, a buffalo cauliflower taco because why not?!  Also excellent.  The cauliflower was cooked to a perfect level of tenderness and full of flavor.   I truly hope these folks have plans for a sit-down spot in the future, as they stand out among the endless taco options popping up around town. Until then, I'm happy to oblige to their delicious grab and go format!",

Very fresh, very restricted diet friendly IMHO. Easy to go gluten free or veg but don't know about strict allergy limitations. Super friendly atmosphere and quick service at 7:30 pm Wednesday. Hubby had the chicken and brisket tacos; I had the spicy! Chorizo, cauliflower and mushroom ones. Mushrooms were my favorites for sure. Easy public parking for a dollar on Taylor St one block up (take a left at the light from Liberty driving away from downtown Pittsburgh). Guacamole w chips a nice way to wait the few minutes for your food. Add to your order!",
