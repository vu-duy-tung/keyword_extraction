    "text": "There are SO many good reviews of this place on both Grubhub and Yelp--so I decided to use my weekly calorie-splurge night on their specialty Steak Pie and Chicken Salad. The salad was what I expected, really nothing great at all--a little bit of iceberg lettuce, onion, 2 grape tomatoes, chicken and a few steak fries, essentially what you would expect ordering a salad from a pizza place. (Think of this one Family Guy episode, haha.) But the pizza was equally unappetizing. Not only was is luke-warm upon arrival, but the toppings weren't properly cooked. It was a bunch of raw green peppers, mushrooms and some other barely-cooked veggies with very little steak on top of thin, under-cooked dough. I am genuinely disappointed right now. It looked really good when I opened it, but I knew after the first bite it was a bust. Perhaps this was just a bad day for them, but they won't be getting any business from me ever again--there are too many other great pizza places in Pittsburgh to waste my money on one that can produce such an underwhelming (and frankly, off-putting) product.",

I also used to buy a large regular pizza and would have enough to reheat (this pizza reheats remarkably well in a toaster oven) for days afterward; Little Nippers has seen me through more finals than I want to remember!  I've also had the steak salads here that are served in the 'Pittsburgh' style (i.e. loaded with fries and cheese on top) and am a fan.  It is a bit pricier than the other pizza shops in the area that cater to the students but it is definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I first heard of this place through their mailer ad.  Their menu is very large (pasta to gyros to salads, not to mention their actual pizzas) which I think hurts them a bit.  I read a review on a different site that gave them a low rating based on their soups, but I don't think this should be representative of their pizza.  Come on people!  If you're going to order out to a pizza place, get the freakin' pizza!  Which brings me to my next point: their pizza is absolutely delicious!  The best part is their fantastic crust, which is just the right amount of chewiness and crispiness and taste.  Some people prefer a really thick or thin crust, so I should mention that theirs is a little bit on the thick side, but it's always cooked perfectly (no dough-iness).  I've tried their specialty Seafood Pizza as well as their Artichoke Pizza and both were loaded with toppings and tasted sooooo good.  I also have tasted their plain cheese pizza, which was tasty also.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable (especially for the specialty pizzas) and keep in mind that their \"medium\" pizza is like a large at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  I have had the pizza delivered as well as chosen to pick it up.  They might be a little slow when delivering because they offer to deliver to such a huge area, so the smart thing to do might be to call in for pick up.  So in closing, skip all the \"fluff\" on their menu and try one of their specialty pizzas.    You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "So, I was out in this neighborhood at that point of the evening when all you want to do is have some food you really wouldn't want to eat sober, then drink a tall glass of water and get to sleep. This place looked very promising from the outside, a hole in the wall Italian joint that offered pizza by the slice, according to a small whiteboard in the window.   So I walk in and there is no menu board. Hmm. I look around for a menu on the counter, or a carry out menu near the door or something. No and no. A middle aged man and woman behind the stop their conversation in another language (not Italian) and the guy asks \"What do you want\". Me: \"Pizza by the slice.\" Him: \"We're all out.\" Then we just kind of look at each other for a while, as I wait for him to offer an alternative, or to say that the next batch will be in X minutes. No luck however, so I just walk out. . .   As I'm leaving, I notice one other item advertised on the white erase board: a Gyro special. So, now that I know they offer at least two types of food, I decide to try again. I return to the counter and this time the woman asks me what I want. I say \"A gyro\" (pronounced \"yee-roh\"). Her: \"A what?\" Me: \"A yee-roh\" Her: \"Wha?t\"  Me: \"A Jie-roh.\" OK, I know that \"\"Jie-roh\" is the more common pronunciation amongst non-Greeks, but how do you actually work at a restaurant that serves this product and not even know there are two pronunciations? This is what we in the amateur restaurant review industry refer to as A Very Bad Sign. But after crossing this language barrier it turns out that they are in stock, and I get one to go.    How was my Jie-roe? Well, remember the gyros you got in the high school cafeteria, with the razor thin slices of pressed mystery meat, the flavorless limp white/yellow lettuce, one sad tomato and some white goo that has been prepared by someone who has never heard the word Tzatziki in their lifetime? It tasted like that.   Other people seemed to have better luck with the pizza. That is the positive note I will end on.",

Like most places in the Oakland area when you order you never know if you are going to get a hit or a miss.  I used to order the family feast at least once a week and the hoagies were always exceptional but now, you unwrap it and the lettuce is soggy and wilted (and not from the heat of the hoagie), the breadsticks have almost no cheese or garlic salt on them and the pizza is super greasy.  If you decide to pay to have a topping thrown on it, be forewarned that the pepperoni is going to make it even harder to handle.  I'd order from them if I needed something after 1am because they do deliver later on the weekends but outside of that, there are a hundred other places to give your money to that will treat you with a little bit of class when you call and order.",

Anyway this is the best hangover food place in Pitt!. Lots, and tons of greasy melted cheese that dribbles over your big bites. I eat here like I'm in a food eating contest shoveling in huge mouthfuls of salty, doughy, cheesy goodness. The ham and pineapple pizza is pretty rad and I love the calzones too. It's so much cheese my heart is ready to stop with each bite. You would think that the 5 cheese calzone is what to get when going for the calzone but I have found that some of the different cheeses that are in it are an extreme salt overload. The meatball calzone or the ones I have gotten with filling then don't have enough cheese! The Goldilocks in me has me choosing the regular plain calzone it's juuust right!    The pastas are pizza shop pastas, greasy, thicker gummy noodles reminiscent of Chef Boyardee comfort! I like the spaghetti and meatballs. Going simple here is the way to go. The taco pizza is interesting but again it's not fine dining but everything I have tried has been sending me back for 5 years! So if you wake up in the morning with a yearning for a down the block Pizza GO to the Nippers.   This is a take out place so no eating in, and they have a wide delivery range... they even come out all the way to the boonies of regent square. One of the very few that does!",

Delivery is almost always under their 45 min wait time and the delivery persons are very kind. I love ordering from here",

Probably frozen, definitely processed, and tasted like cold mashed potatoes that just got a divorce.

    "text": "To widen my Craig St. pizza horizons a bit, I decided to give Little Nipper's a try tonight, since I was in the mood for some take out.  When I walked in the door, I was immediately greeted by the guy behind the counter and a guy who I assume was the owner.  I asked him if they served pizza by the slice, and he said that indeed, they did, though they'd have to make a fresh pie.  I said, \"But I can still buy just a couple slices, right?\", and he assured me that this was the case.  I told him that in that case, I'd have two slices of plain.  He told me it would take about ten minutes, so I went for a walk around the block.  When I returned about ten min. later, the owner told me it'd be one more minute and I said that was fine, and that I'd wait.  At this point, another guy who I hadn't talked to before saw my CMU t-shirt and asked me if that was where I went to school.  I told him that I'm finished with school, and that I work as a researcher now.  He asked me what I research, and I told him, and he told me he thought my topic of research was really interesting, and proceeded to show me that he even knew a bit about it.  I was impressed, since most people walking around don't know much of anything about my topic of research (though many people find it interesting, nevertheless!).  Anywho, I took my box of slices back to my apt., where I opened it.  The slices smelled and looked good, but they seemed a bit greasy, and the crust seemed a bit soft.  After dabbing off a bit of the grease and sprinkling on a bit of Italian seasoning, I proceeded to eat them.  As I predicted, the flavor was good--the sauce was a bit on the sweeter side, and the cheese was classic mozzarella--but the crust wasn't crispy.  So, while they were good, they don't beat out the crispy-crusted slices of Pizza Prima, my Craig St. pizza standby.  On the other hand, they're definitely better than chain pizza slices (Papa John's, Domino's, etc.).  So, if other places on Craig St. are closed and the hours are conducive to your needs, if you need delivery, or if you're in the area and you'd just like to try something new, I'd recommend giving it a try.  3.5 stars.",

I came into the restaurant on a Friday afternoon and was greeted by the owner. I asked him the dimensions of the Large Pizza, and he couldn't even give me a definitive answer. He just said 12 slices, which gives me absolutely no information about how big it is. I ended up ordering a medium Nipper's Specialty (combination pizza).  When I got back home, I was astonished that anyone could actually ruin pizza. The green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions weren't cut thinly, and as a result, soaked the pizza. The pizza had no flavor because the water diluted all of the salt in the cured meats (pepperoni and bacon). Furthermore, the dough was chewy because they didn't bake it long enough to evaporate the water. Simply put, it was a bad experience.  I will never come here again. $15 for a medium mediocre specialty pizza is a joke. I would much rather go to Pizza Prima, which is only half a block away.",

Let's face it pizza is like sex, when it's good it's good and when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  This pizza is no different from any other take out pizza place. Though I think they put yogurt in thier dough (just a guess, I'm not very clear headed when I eat this).   They deliver until late I want to say 2am but I really dont look at the clock and the pizza, at least in my mind, arrives instantaneously the delivery man is always happy and always has an accent and I wanna ask where he's from but my drunk self usually thinks it will be rude.  Overall it's a great place to get pizza at 2am from. I will never order it when I'm sober for the simple fact that I do not want to mess with a good thing",
