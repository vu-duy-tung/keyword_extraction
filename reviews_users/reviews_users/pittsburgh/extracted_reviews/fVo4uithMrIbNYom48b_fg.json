    "text": "It is hard to find a decent Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, but this one works. Have been here twice and both my husband and I ordered different items.  The first time we sat on the deck, which unfortunately is very loud due to Washington Rd/19 being right there.  The second time we sat inside which was better. We also wanted to see if service was better inside than out.  Sorry to say it was not. We had a different server each time and both were nice but slow. It takes a bit of time to have someone initially come over then be consistently attentive afterward.    On a good note, we ordered a pitcher of \"Texas\" margaritas each time and they are really good. They would be excellent if there was more lime juice and less orange, but that is personal preference.   Living in Texas for 3 years and not finding a good chili relleno, I was happily surprised to find an authentic one on the menu. Unlike a previous review, my pepper was not \"oily\" at all and the batter was very light. On a different day I ordered mole' enchiladas and they were very good. The mole' sauce had depth of flavor and the chicken was tender and juicy. My husband always goes for a combo plate and said everything was good except for the tamale. Nothing special. Too much masa to meat ratio. I tasted the red sauce on the tamale and enchilada and it was delicious!  Overall this is solid Mexican restaurant that needs some server education.",

    "text": "Came here for a quick anniversary dinner on a weeknight.  The parking lot isn't very big, but we found a great spot.  There were only a few other people in the restaurant, which isn't always a good sign, but about ten minutes later, the dining room filled up with the dinner crowd.  Chips and salsa appeared only a minute after we sat down.  Not the best I've ever had, but they weren't salty, which I prefer.  Chipotle's chips are basically a bag of salt.  Our waiter didn't seem interested in us at all as he stared at the TV while he took our order.  Our drinks and food arrived in a timely manner, although other people actually brought our food to the table, not our waiter.  And while I can't stand a waiter who checks on you every five minutes, this waiter never checked on us once.  He never asked how our food was, never asked if we needed refills, never asked if we wanted dessert (which we were going to get).  We sat there for ten minutes after we ate and I took the last sip of my drink.  Our waiter checked on other tables but not us.  We had to flag him down and ask for our check.  I've never seen a server look so confused before, and still he stared at the TV.  Needless to say, we did not get dessert.  The food, on the other hand, gets four stars from me.  The black beans were the best I've had at any restaurant.  The beef taco was a little greasy but tasty.  My husband's food was extremely greasy, but he still ate it.  Nothing seemed frozen or microwaved, except the rice seemed like the kind you heat up for 90 seconds in the microwave, but I could be wrong.  It was probably the only thing I didn't really eat on my two plates-yes, two plates-of food.  The portions were great for the price you pay.  After tip, food and two drinks, it was about $50.  Had we gone to Mad Mex, for example, we would have paid more for subpar food and tight seating.  This place was much more comfortable and you can actually hear people when they talk.  I just hope that the other people who actually served us and cooked our food got a portion of the tip as our waiter didn't deserve any of it.  Sorry, Jesus.  Maybe you were having a bad night.",

    "text": "I write this review with disappointment because it is not pleasurable to give even my worst restaurant experiences two stars let alone one but, in this case, one star is sadly accurate.  I have visited El Paso Mexican Grill twice (which is two more times than I care to mention).  Obviously, my first experience was dreadful but I tend not to badmouth anyone based off one experience.  However, my second experience was so equally horrible that I won't ever go back nor could I ever with good intentions recommend El Paso to anyone, not even my worst enemy. So, here is my accurate, candid review of El Paso Mexican Grill which I ate at twice in the past two months: The positives:  The restaurant itself has a cool layout in that one can watch the traffic from high above Washington Road.  Also, there is a reasonably sizable deck which would be a great place to have a margarita or more with some friends (just order drinks and appetizers ... you'll regret anything more).   El Paso's guacamole is very good.  Its not the best I've had, not even the best in the area, but it is good.  They have an OUTSTANDING tomatillo sauce.  It is a brownish, roasted tomatillo with ample spice (heat) and a terrific taste.  They should be very proud of their tomatillo sauce.  They stock Jarritos soda. There are friendly employees, kind waiters who look the part for a place masquerading as a Mexican restaurant, quick service, and the traditional decorations Pittsburghers expect to see in a place with this genre.   The negatives:  To be upfront and honest,  if Taco Bell is the \"Mexican\" McDonald's then El Paso (at its best) is the \"Mexican\" Eat n Park (at its worst). The menu is \"hokie\" and the food is atrocious.  Actually, if I could find a word which is worse than atrocious, it is that word.  To elaborate, we walk in to El Paso and are nicely welcomed and immediately seated.  About five minutes later garden variety chips and the typical very mild, fresh, red salsa was served. Next, our drink orders taken.  When the waiter brought our drinks I asked if they had a spicier salsa to which he replied yes.  He brought me tomatillo sauce at no extra charge but proceeded to explain to me that this salsa, which is made in house, is free at El Paso but costs $2.00 extra at El Campesino (where he used to work).  I assume he meant El Campesino in McMurray which is a typical mid-Atlantic \"Mexican style\" restaurant of MUCH better quality than El Paso.  Anyways,  I ate the salsa with boring yellow corn chips which were from a bag.  My friend and I ordered our food, I ordered a typical Mexican staple of enchiladas verde and my friend ordered Flautas which were labeled Tacquitos Mexicana.  We waited for about ten minutes as we munched on our bag chips.  A quick turn around from ordering to receiving my meal always throws red flags into the air and for good reason.  The tacquitos were extremely greasy (2 beef - dry roast beef and 2 chicken - which were a chicken tinga and looked halfway decent) served on a bed of shredded bag lettuce, a scoop of sour cream (undoubtedly straight from a Daisy container) and guacamole which, in certain places,  was actually brown from oxidation and warm temperature.   I felt bad as I watched my friend eat the tacquitos with grease dripping from the fried tortilla shells.  I could not believe that any restaurant outside of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares would even consider serving a plate such as that let alone actually bring it to table.  Arron Sanchez would have flipped his lid for disgracing his native culture's food in such a heinous way. On to my meal.  I was served three pseudo-corn shell enchiladas, crispy and tough on the ends, and saturated wet in the middle, smothered (not covered but smothered three times removed) in cheese of an unknown origin.  It was white cheese of some sort but it was tasteless and not identifiable.  There was some green watery verde sauce on the ends of my enchilada mush but the sauce has no texture, no consistency, no taste and was well ... as thin as water.  I was also served yellow \"Mexican\" rice which either came from a box or someone else's plate.  I kid not, this stuff had to have been a few days old.  Stale, tasteless, with a few thawed peas mixed in.  Unbelievable.  And, finally, there was a small pile of shredded bag lettuce, wilted and brown on the ends, underneath a scoop of Daisy and a slice of tomato.  That's it.  That was my meal. That is what they set in front of my and expected me to lie about enjoying and actually pay for.  ANY EMPLOYEE IN THE RESTAURANT who looked at me could tell that I know this is not Mexican food nor was it edible food.  They should feel embarrassed for themselves because I sure am embarrassed for them.  Anyways, I scraped off 90% of the cheese, ate the parts of the enchiladas which were edible, paid the bill and left never to return again. They never even asked how my meal was ... they knew.  They knew, I knew.  NEVER recommended!",

We walked in a stood around for a while trying to figure out if we were supposed to seat ourselves or be seated.  Someone noticed us after a few minutes and seated us.  Chip and salsa were good and they refilled it for us twice.  We didn't order any drinks but happy hour is 4-7 and they had some good drink specials.  A Corona would have been $2.99 and house margarita was $4.  The service was friendly and polite but very slow.  We waited for our food for a long time.  My husband and I both ordered enchiladas and we both liked them, especially the refried beans.  The kids meals were a good size and only $4.50.  Both of our kids got a cheese quesadilla, taco and french fries.  Overall we liked the food. The service just needs some work but I guess that's to be expected with a new restaurant.",

    "text": "A mixed bag, I've been going here for awhile but I'm liking it less and less. The short version: +good food +decent view +decent atmosphere and decorations -Promotions they use to get people in the door aren't worth it -Parking is mildly annoying -Staff are overworked or just a few don't pay much attention.  First, their parking lot is tiny, and they have about 4 signs (instead of signs with daily specials) warning patrons not to park across the street or else they will be towed... but they have an agreement to let people park at a church across the street and about 3 doors down. This has always been an issue with this location even before it became El Paso's... but it's offset by the view. There are big windows by the bar and a decently large patio overlooking a small valley with lots of trees but also noisy 4-lane Rt 19. The menu is fairly large and includes seafood and vegetarian options. If you don't KNOW your Mexican food, a large part of the menu lacks descriptions and the rest is described in generic ingredients. Lately I usually get the Cozumel burrito. The Cozumel is tasty, with tender moist pulled pork, caramelized peppers and onion slivers like a fajita, a light cheese sauce, and a large enough portion for a little leftovers, no sides. On my most recent visit, I decided to order a $2.99 draft (regular size, not tall) XX beer and the $10.99 Cozumel, my wife got a chipotle-honey shrimp dish that she thought was a really good balance of sweet and spicy. She had to leave early, and I thought it was nice that one of the bartenders asked if I was happy, if I'd been there before (I usually eat outside, and bring friends). Our actual server never asked if I needed more water even though I was 3/4 finished before the food arrived, and I noticed he charged me for a $4 drink on the receipt, and our meal was about $36 after tax. On a previous visit, a different server tried to decline a coupon (which said it was good till the end of next month) for a free dessert, but after a mood-killing wait to talk to a manager they brought out a really small slice of snickers pie. I don't know if they cut a normal slice in half, or if their portions really are just that small.  It's not that cheap or convenient, and the food is good but not special, and it's a shame because I feel like it was a better restaurant when they first opened. As it stands, I'm starting to consider other places on the lower or higher end of prices.",

One waiter was working, mind you this was during normal dinner hours so why they had one waiter is beyond me.  Needless to say it took forever to take our orders.  It took even longer for the food to show up and when it did the order was missing my wife's tacos.  We were so hungry that we really didn't care at this point and started eating.  The chicken items were good but the beef burrito was literally one of the nastiest things I've ever tasted ( I think it was rancid ).  I immediately spit it out and couldn't finish the food.  The cherry on top is when we got home my wife started throwing up and I've literally been awake all night with diarrhea (seriously I'm making this post at 4:45 am).

I chose the number 1 lunch special, a Chile relleno and taco with a salad and beans. The Chile relleno was big, but wasn't my favorite. The children's taco, rice and beans was very big for a child, not complaining.  The other person with me had the lunch taco salad. It was in a taco shell and a good size, with a choice of beef or chicken. The person with me said it was good. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh.

    "text": "I hate to say this but El Paso was run of mill. Nothing special. The salsa was the most delicious thing we had. The menu is extensive with many pages, so there is something for everyone. The service wasn't great, but it could be because they were understaffed and serving the dining room and the outside patio. The house margarita wasn't good, it tasted like bottled margarita mix, I didn't even drink half of mine. We didn't get the correct food we ordered either. We got someone else's order and it took about 10 minutes for any staff to come to our area to inform them. We went upfront and no one was around either. With all of the other Mexican in the area, we probably won't be back.",

I ordered the Sante Fe chicken salad, what I received was seasoned chicken cutlet that looked like a two year old ripped it apart on top of a bed of hot shredded lettuce with  peppers, onions, and mushrooms that were sauteed. It also came with a fried tortilla bowl filled with guacamole, pico, and sour cream. I am displeased because I just wanted a simple salad. Also, when we called to order they had no delivery driver for the day, and when we went to pick up the order they had no change for a cash transaction.",

I pulled in and there was one parking space left. That's usually a good sign. I wasn't able to eat in so I was curious how the take out would be. The host and hostess were quick to greet me and give me a menu. I ordered chicken enchiladas for myself. I sat down to wait but I didn't have to wait lol no. What I saw of the restaurant looked nice. The servers seemed friendly and speedy.  When I got home I was worried that I might have to reheat the food. I was wrong. It was still hot. You opened your container and the steam and aroma came out-mmmmmm yummy. I had ordered chicken enchiladas. The chicken was shredded and moist. I really enjoyed the flavor of their sauce. It wasn't too spicy and had a slow roasted taste. They threw in chips and salsa which was a nice surprise. The chips were thin and crispy and the salsa had a nice flavor.  I'll be going back and taking friends. Their margaritas looked inviting.",

We tried this today for lunch, wanted to sit out side on the deck and have a drink and sample some of the food. We were the only ones there for lunch, which is usually not a good sign, but we pushed on. We sat outside and ordered two  margaritas on the rocks. They were ok, not great just a standard mix with some house tequila. The waiter was about as friendly as a cactus.. never smiled never engaged us never asked us anything besides what we wanted. So we thought we would try the quesadillas to start and go from there They have a grilled quesadilla that is two dollars more than the standard, so we thought we we would try one beef one chicken to see what it was like. It was literally a few pieces of chicken with some shredded cheese sprinkled inside and queso poured on top... period No lettuce, no tomato, no quac no salsa, nothing. Needless to say, we didn't order anything else. I would consider giving it a second shot for dinner, but with Totopo only a short drive further, I won't be back.",

I like a clean restaurant as much as the next person but don't particularly like the scent of harsh cleaner. Luckily the food smelled better! The chips and salsa arrived quickly. The chips were fresh, corn and not salty (which I have to avoid). The salsa was also fresh and had a light bite. I ordered the single grilled chicken quesadilla with a side salad which was a right sized meal, no leftovers. The salad, oddly enough, had no dressing, but I was able to make do with leftover salsa. The quesadilla had almost too much melted queso (not too much if you love cheese). I had a regular sized lime margarita (no salt) which was on the watery side. My son had chori pollo which he enjoyed quite a bit. Overall, there were enough positives , combined with a low bill, that we decided we would return and try again.

    "text": "This newly opened Mexican restaurant is located on N. Highland Road, about half-way between the Un-Common Market, and Trader Joes (It's a little bit hard to notice, as the building sits towards the back of the parking lot).  The dining room windows and outdoor deck give you a view of busy Washington Road.  Not unlike other El Paso Mexican Grills in the area, they offer an Americanized version of Mexican food.  They also have a full bar, and I noticed a frozen Margarita machine, and a few Mexican beers on tap.  The service was good, the server was very polite, and the food arrived quickly after ordering, including complimentary chips and salsa, but I wasn't very fond of my lunch today.  I had the lunch special #1 which included a Chile Relleno, Beef Taco, Gucamole Salad, and Re-fried Beans.  The taco meat and the fried pepper were very oily, and both left heavy puddles of oil on the plates (see photo of my plates, and you will notice the oil coming out of the food before I even touched them).  There also really wasn't a lot of flavor in the food, except for the oil.  I probably would've rated one more star if the food wasn't so oily, but overall, I just thought it was meh, and didn't even finish my plate.",

Obviously mortified, I found someone to tell them. I would have cleaned it myself.

We parked and walked up ... the restaurant was not crowded but took a bit to get seated .. sounded like a crowd was in the back and may have been the cause of the full lot.    We get seated and boom....chips and salsa drop in the table .. yea!!!  Our waiter introduces himself - takes our drink order - then the food (I got a burrito and my friend the chicken fajita - no onions). We also got a bowl of queso ( thought it was a little pricey for the size bowl you get .. $4.50)  Food comes .. mine is fine .. my friend had to sent back because it can with onions.  About 10 min later she gets her's (and it right) and we can eat.   After we were done with our means we packed up the left overs and asked for a desert menu .. just to see what they had. Typical Mexican treats like flan, fried ice cream and soppapias are on the menu and the prices were typical to others we have seen ( about $7 for fried ice cream and you pick from like 8 toppings)   Except for one issue with the onions ... We enjoyed our first visit here and would go back ..",

I've always gone around 5pm and never had an issue parking or getting seated right away, though. So go a little early to beat the crowd.

I like how much bigger this restaurant is compared to the one that I usually go to. However, parking can be a pain if you come on Fridays or weekends.  As you get seated, they serve you with free chips and salsa which by the way is great when the chips are still hot. I ordered the two combo with a burrito and a tamale. It also came with rice and fried beans. I liked my dish but wasn't a big fan of the burrito. My friends ordered the fajita which I will highly recommend as it comes with a lot of food and was delicious!",

On top of the great atmosphere, the service is always friendly and fast, and the food is very good.  The queso here is really good and is a great starter.  Not too runny and not too thick.  It's easy to fill up on though.  I also like their salsa, which has a little kick to it.    The last time I was here I went with the enchiladas verdes.  Their green salsa topping on the enchiladas was delicious and made for a great dish.  In the past I have had the cheesesteak burrito which is probably my favorite dish.  They also have some really good tacos, with plenty of variety.",

Missed happy hour tonight, it appears it is daily from 4-6. The good here is the food. Chips and salsa were provided and we added the queso fundido which was excellent. I had the chicken chimichangas which were a pretty big portion and also excellent. The not so good was the drink I had. Tried the frozen house margarita which was just not great at all. It was watery and very sweet, just tasted like margarita mix. While our waitress was very nice, the service here was rather poor. Not sure if she had to cover both the indoor and outdoor areas but we felt a bit neglected at our table. Definitely willing to try this place again though since the food was great!",

We ended up walking out and will never be back or recommend this place.",

Dinner plans with friends were switched to this restaurant, so I gave a call to check whether they could accommodate my gluten-free diet. The server answering the phone said he could not give me an answer (seriously?) and asked that I call back when a manager was available. (Good customer service would dictate that the servers would have a clue, or at least take my name & # and have someone call ME back.) Spoke to a manager the next day or said they could not accommodate me. Watching others eat gets old fast, so I passed.",

    "text": "I have been staring at this place from my balcony for weeks since I moved here, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to visit. Well this week, a friend asked me to dinner and I immediately knew where I wanted to go. I was so excited.  I have heard great things, so I'm not sure if I went on a bad night or what. It wasn't awful and it's nearby, so I want to begin with saying I will give it another chance and update my review accordingly.  We decided to sit outside on the patio. There was a nice breeze and even though it's close to the road, I didn't hear any traffic. We were seated quickly and given the usual chips and salsa. It took over 20 minutes for somebody to take care of us. Servers would ask if anybody had been with us, we would reply \"no\" and they would walk away. This happened at least 4 times. By the time we had a margarita in front of us it was over 30 minutes since we had arrived and our mouths were burning and we were dying of thirst from the salsa. Some water would have helped.  The menu was vast and there was a large variety of choices, more so than most places of this type. Since we had so much time to review it, we knew exactly what we wanted to order and didn't waste any time letting the server know. I ordered the combination fajitas with steak chicken and shrimp. My friend had chorizo tacos. The food took a while, but not as long as I expected considering our first impression. They originally brought my friend out the wrong food and tacos that contained shrimp. He has a shellfish allergy, yikes!!! They quickly fixed the problem and we began to eat. The food was kind of bland and flavorless and it just seemed to be missing something that I couldn't put my finger on. The Margarita I ordered was huge, however was far from the best that I had ever had. I asked for a stronger smaller one next and it was much better.  Needless to say, The whole experience was just not what I anticipated which made me very sad because I was so happy to try it out. Hopefully I will have better luck next time.",

We waited for an 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink orders, and never got waters. The server somehow forgot my drink order when everyone else's came. Then he took our food orders and when it came out, apparently had forgotten to put in my food order. I don't know why it was always me that he forgot about but I found that to be terrible service. As we were there, we saw another family literally leave the place before ordering because it took the wait staff so long to take their orders. They definitely still have a few things to work out.",

Real authentic Mexican cuisine, amazing service, quick and let's not forget the unbeatable prices. The chips were served warm with homemade salsa that was great. We had a quest appetizer as well that was also great. For my meal, I had the fajita quesadilla & it was delicious! My husband had one of the combination dishes and really enjoyed it as well. We got two dinners, an appetizer and 3 jumbo margaritas for 50 bucks. Can't beat it! Our servers were so friendly and always there for refills, clearing plates and making sure we were okay. We were also in and out in under an hour on a Saturday night. I will certainly return to El Paso and would recommend it to everyone!",
