    "text": "This is the best place i have been to in the South Hills. Nothing else like it!! Atmosphere is awesome and i love the modern decor. I dont see how anyone can give this place a negative review. There was nothing bad at all about it. The bar is beautiful with multi colored lights that change. How cool is that?? I had the special, Poutine fries and it was delicious. My friend had the Pecan salad which she loved. The portions are huge and I saw a lot of people leave with doggie bags. I also ate here a few weeks ago for their Sunday brunch. SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM and the prime rib was to die for- totally melt in your mouth. I choose the option of having 2 Mimosas which were included but i could have paid only $5 more for the  unlimited Bloody Mary bar. WHAT??? I met the owners and they are awesome. Cant wait to book a giant GNO in the summer when the patio opens. If you dont stop in to dine here you are missing out!!",

This place is a welcome addition. Tried the ribeye and crab cakes. Both were excellent. Kids steak was a full 8 oz steak. Daughter was impressed. Still working through a few kinks in the opening weeks, but I expect vilka bistro to become a South Hills Hotspot quickly. I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "Went there for brunch today. Had the prime rib and it was perfectly cooked. The flavor was delicious. They have build your own omelette station. There is a waffle making station, fresh cut fruit, and other breakfast/lunch items. All you can drink momosas. All 5 of us enjoyed it. Great value at 24$ per person and looking forward to coming back for dinner. Met the owner and the brunch is only going to be growing with more items. The menu changes 3-4 times per year. The place is amazing and very welcoming. You walk in and can hardly believe you are still in bethel park. I'm looking forward to the outdoor seating, come spring. I saw pictures of the patio and was impressed and eager to come back. Can't wait for summer and to have a delicious well spent meal outside in a great atmosphere. You have to try this place and see for yourself. P.S the bar is incredible!!!",

    "text": "I will likely be reiterating what others have said.  1. Food was excellent.  It was Friday so it was fish all around.  3 people had the special - Chilean Sea Bass.  Portion was nice (especially compared to the large chain seafood restaurant) and was perfectly cooked.  I had the scallops - also cooked perfectly.  In general, I'm not a fan of risotto so can't say if it was done well or not, it's just not my thing.   We also shared a wedge salad which was very nice. 2.  Service was very good.  The waitress was friendly and really engaged with everyone. 3.  Only complaint was the dining area.  I realize they're just getting started and the crowd was light for a Friday night which made you feel concerned about how everything was going to be.  Like someone else said, I think they could try dimming the lights to make it a bit more \"cozy\" for lack of a better word. 4.  I think if people try this place, they'll like it.  Seems like they need to get the word out more.",

As far as the meat & potatoes, I have to give 2 thumbs down. The server, though kind & knowledgeable of the menu was not very attentive (& only had 2 tables) and the food quality was poor. Menu selection was pretty good & sounded great but my burger was over done, plain & dry. My sisters salad was blah. Beer selection was ok, but we got the wrong beer (thought it was just flat but realized when we got the bill, it was different from what was ordered.) The bill, was presented to me correctly, but when rung up, was the table next to us. Waiter quickly apologized & fixed but I can't say I'd come back. If so, just for a drink or two, but quality just doesn't justify the price.",

Went to brunch today with my mother in law bc she has suggested this place bc she has gone for a drink. So I've seen them post on social media about their brunch. We went and man we were dissatisfied. We got sat quickly and the brunch is buffet style. I really like that option. The server came over and told us that it's brunch and you get a mimosa with the buffet. Nice little perk! But we went up and took a look and was underwhelmed. They had a craving station normal bfast meats and some random lunch items. Also made to order omelettes and waffles. The danishes are store bought and the fruit platter was super sad.   My mother in law loves prime rib so she got that and they also had her favorite bread pudding. She literally took a bit of the bread pudding and said it was terrible. Then onto her other favorite prime rib, she took a few bites and threw it away. She had a piece of chicken and couldn't finish that either. So everything that was on her plate she picked at. She was very upset that nothing was good.   I got an made to order omelette, that's hard to mess up so it was good. I got the bacon which was eh and then thank the lord they had salad bc I pretty much filled up on that.   So we both looked at each other when finished unsatisfied. We got our check and both in utter shock! The bill was $48, so that's $24 for their buffet. WHAT THE HECK!!! The grand concourse brunch is about the same price for a whole a lot more food that is totally amazing.   Inclusion we will not be back and super sad that we wasted our money there. I really hope you guys step your game up bc that area needs a good restaurant!",

Everything else with the dish and the Crab cakes dish was prepared as requested and tasted great. The peach dessert was so good and plenty for 2 to share.

Strange since at the check-in because the staff huddled around the computer to make that decision.  The interior, table, chairs, linen and dinnerware are all very nice. The glass of Decibel Sauvignon Blanc was sour, should not have been served and was returned.  The Smoked Old Fashion was tasty.   Beet salad and Ceasar salad where both very good.  The ribeye was a decent cut of meat, however the preparation for medium rare was not executed well.  Top side was overcooked and   bottom side undercooked resulting in the red \"center\" being on the bottom.  The steak was plated on top of a generous portion of tasty mash potatoes.  The peas where not evenly cooked, some extremely charred and other untouched.  The mussels... blah. Overall expectations not met for the price.",

I tried a beet salad a month or so ago and it didn't disappoint, fresh greens, unlike other restaurants iceberg lettuce. Large portions which lent itself to great leftovers!  Today I tried the Mac N Cheese with bacon. I also ordered a side salad. Dressing was excellent as was the green salad with just the right amount of onions, croutons and tomatoes. The mac n cheese was excellent and really could have been shared with my lunch partner. We both took home leftovers. We never order dessert, but both times we visited Vilka, we have! So far have tried the blonde/black brownie and creme brulee. My friend has had the creme brulee and the Drunken Peach Cobbler, which she raved about. One of the nicest features is that we were allowed to linger, not rushed out by staff, as is the case in other restaurants.",

    "text": "We waited nearly a month before trying this place to give them a chance to work out the bugs. Maybe we should have waited longer. The highpoint was the autumn squash salad my wife ordered. The sweet nuts added just the right touch to the fresh greens. I ordered the chicken with pasta. The chicken was dry and the portion of meat was less than generous.   My wife ordered the spiral zucchini. It wasn't meant to be a soup, but it was served with so much liquid that she was compelled to send it back to the kitchen to be drained. She commented that it lacked flavor.  The service wasn't quite there yet. Our server was friendly enough but took some time to check to see if we were happy with our meals. A number of servers were congregated in the back of the restaurant, maybe for training. We couldn't be sure.  What is it about Pittsburgh restaurants feeling that people need time after the dishes are cleared before they bring over the check? I thought we were so over that when smoking was banned.  The truth is that we might give this place a second chance someday. They might still be working the bugs out and we want to give them the benefit of the doubt.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but they do claim that all food is fresh and cooked to order. We'll probably wait until some of our friends come back with a glowing review before we give them a second chance.  Update: We tried them again. The food was good, but the service moves at snail's pace.  Our server, Lisa, informed me that they were out of the bone-in chicken breast that was my first choice.  She brought over the menu and I made another selection. Ten minutes later she came back and said that the chef was playing a joke on her and my meal would be my first choice.  I would find fooling around like that unprofessional at a fast food restaurant.  At a white tablecloth place it is unforgivable.  There were three of us in our party. Two of us ordered desert. The creme brulee was watery and the traditional crust was thin. The peach concoction my wife ordered wasn't as good as she remembered.  My wife still loved her August salad. Not sure I'd jump at the chance to come back.",

It was like warm at best and the color and consistency were off. Had a half a wedge salad. Lettuce was wilted, blue cheese dressing seemed homemade but had zero flavor. Weird. Not even any salt. Gross roasted tomatoes. Just don't. Seemed like they use these tomatoes in a variety of dishes. Nobody wants a cold, unseasoned slimy cherry tomato anywhere in their food. Then had Chilean sea bass for entree. It was a special. Fish was somewhat fresh I guess... again no seasoning and it was in a pool of overly salty creamy sauce w what was described as roasted veg. More like a few pieces of carrots n celery.  Where was the zucchini, Brussels sprouts or asparagus??? Overall the entire table had issues with their food. Two of my friends had scallops which looked good. A little rubbery though. And I tasted one that was gritty with sand. Needed cleaned obvi. But the worst of the night was the risotto. So overly seasoned with sage and it was crunchy. There was literally 3 cups of this gunk under the scallops. My friend even described her steak as \"gummy\". . Even the spicy marg got sent back because my friend described it as tasting like \"vomit\". Just an overall bad experience. Don't go.",

The menu isn't pages and pages, but what's on there is varied and not the same old stuff. One minor quibble, the seafood entrees tend toward the shellfish and mollusks, those who enjoy fin fish more will be a little disappointed.   The bartender knows what she's doing. That's all I'll say. Wine list is limited but the selections they have are good ones. Plenty of beers.   After a tasty Caesar salad I had the pork belly, which was cooked perfectly. My partner had the special of the day, hassenfeffer, a rabbit dish with a fennel sauerkraut that was amazing. We finished up with a vanilla bean creme brulee that was a denser than usual but still a nice ending to a great dinner.   We weren't hungry enough to get starters and entrees but we will come back to get starters next time.",

The owner was there when I had to send back the GRAY fishy smelling ahi salad, but didn't bother doing anything about it. When they brought the salad out, both my husband & I could immediately smell the fish. Yikes. My husband ordered the shepherds pie, the special, and it wasn't great either. A very undercooked square of puff pastry with a swirl of mashed potatoes atop ground meat with peas & carrots. I guess it was someone's take on a modern shepherds pie, but it wasn't successful. Maybe we ordered wrong, was what we said to each other. But I doubt we'd go back, can't trust a kitchen that would serve that tuna.",

Let me say I have the worst luck anytime I finally get the chance to let someone else cook and I was absolutely floored! From the lovely modern decor, it was cozy yet bright and sunny, patio had soft furniture but we sat inside, to the smiling charming waitstaff. A young lady named Sydney waited on us , she was a doll. The place has been open since December she let us know when we asked. She knew the menu well. Everything is priced completely reasonably and since it's not an outrageously complicated menu all the menu items looked made with fresh ingredients and very focusedly thought out.  The scallops I got we're like butter seared perfect and my boyfriend's steak he could cut with a bread knife! Try! Try! Try! Even though we want to keep this place all to ourselves I had to spread the word! You will not be disappointed in taste or price do make up for it in the top and compliments to the chef!",

    "text": "This restaurant just opened a few days ago. I was very excited to try it. It's owned by a local couple. I prefer to support local businesses. When we walked in we were greeted warmly and seated quickly. The restaurant is decorated very tastefully. It leans toward a contemporary feel.  We checked out the menu. I chose the Scallops over Scallion Risotto. When the dish came it was plated beautifully. The Scallops were large and cooked perfectly. The asparagus on top was also cooked perfectly. The Risotto was very flavorful. Since it was scallion I thought it might have a heavy onion taste but it didn't. A lot of people don't do Risotto well but this was the right consistency. It was drizzled with a little herb oil which added to the flavor.  My husband had the Pork Chop. Some places give you two but they give you one-for good reason. The pork chop is huge!  It is one of the thickest pork  chops I've seen. It was cooked perfectly as well. The pork chop was moist despite its thickness. The pork chop had been kind of \"tomahawked\" which made the plating look very nice. It was topped with an apple chutney that went well with the chop. For sides there were mashed potatoes and a warm broccoli and radish salad. I'm not a huge fan of radishes but these had been quartered and sauteed with some basaltic vinegar. They were very tasty.  For dessert we shared the Drunken Peach Which was a peach cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with a bourbon sauce. We were both full but couldn't stop eating it. Yes, it was that good.  Our service was outstanding. Our server was wonderful. She was friendly and kept checking on us and refilling our glasses.  The beer and bar menu was solid. It was definitely better than any chain restaurant. It covers a lot of craft beer. All of the cocktails used top shelf ingredients.  Please note that the lunch menu is different than the dinner menu. (I posted pics of both menus).  I already have a friend meeting me there for lunch on Wednesday to give that menu a try.",

    "text": "After 5 visits to this restaurant I had to finally leave a review. Of our 5 experiences, the first one really stood out as phenomenal, two were average, and two were honestly disastrous.   Our third time to Vilka Bistro we invited a friend to try the newer local place we'd found as the owner told us they did a Sunday brunch buffet with a number of items, prime rib, and endless mimosas included. We got there around noon only to find bland, unappetizing options, and a meat carving station that was unmanned as the chef kept disappearing to the back. The owner did eventually come out and carved us each a slice of prime rib. I wasn't able to experience the omelette or waffle stations as then both the owner and chef disappeared. The chef finally came back and gave us the last bit if prime rib. We asked the bartender if there was any left in the back. She said she was sure there was but when she returned we were told they were out of the meat. She then apologized and stated they normally have more prime rib and better buffet options but that \"this week looks like it kind of sucks.\" Another couple walked in part way through our meal, came up to the buffet and waited for the chef at the omelette station. We told them we hadn't seen anyone manning the line for quite some time and that they were out of prime rib. This couple then told their server the food didn't even look good and they left instead.   Our last, and probably final trip to Vilka was this past weekend. We came about an hour before close for dinner and drinks. The bar was full, including the owner sat at the end. We ordered and waited for our appetizers to arrive. My salad and the Millennium Chicken took at least 15-20 minutes. The bartender then stated our meals were ready and asked us if she'd like them now. We said yes, rather than let them sit under heat lamps. The steak I ordered medium rare was not even pink in the middle and completely burnt black on one end. My finance had the Spicy Pasta with shrimp. The shrimp was completely overcooked and the pasta and sauce was so dry we could tell it had already been sitting under the heat lamps for a while. He called the bartender over and asked to send it back saying it was dry and overcooked. She walked the plate back to the kitchen, right past the owner, who didn't even acknowledge anything had been sent back. She took it off the bill but also offered no apology. I ate my steak since I was hungry and didn't want to wait for a refire. It tasted fine but was just horribly overcooked. I wish I would have sent it back because I spent the remainder of my night in the bathroom kneeling in front of the toilet.  Our first two experiences at Vilka were definitely well above average and the food was really goos, it's sad to see how quickly their standards have dropped. The owner is always there but doesn't seem to care about the quality of food he's putting out. Hopefully in the future he can get some better cooks and other staff that can turn the place around. We need better, locally owned restaurants in Bethel Park!",

At this point, it's not the widest spread of buffet items, but plenty to eat, and all the food is great tasting.  They had waffle, omelet and carving (prime rib) stations, among other offerings.  For a $24 buffet and bottomless mimosas, I think it's a great price.  Service was very good, everyone was very friendly.  I hope this place catches on.  They're off to a good start, and I hope they continue to fine tune things.  They have really nice decor, as well.  For a Sunday brunch at noon, my thought was, if this place was downtown, it would be packed by now, and it was a bit more than half full.",

    "text": "The stars in this review are for the excellent service we received.  I thought the place was nice inside.  Nice spacing between the tables and modern.  The restroom was nice also.   I SO wanted to love this place. The menu sounds so good, but it just wasn't.  I went for the first time on March 20 and there was one other table filled.  While we ate, two more tables arrived.  Very few people there at 12:30 is not a good sign.  :(  I got the California classic sandwich. I took the bun off because I'm low carbing.  I do this at many restaurants and it's still a lot of food.   The chicken breast was so tough I had trouble cutting it.  I took one bite and left it untouched after that.   The avocado slices had so much balsamic on them they were inedible.  The green beans I got were pretty good.    My sister ordered the nachos and said the sauce didn't have any flavor.  The side salad was good with the house made Italian.  She also got the no meat sandwich and said she liked it after dipping it in ranch but otherwise it was bland.   I didn't complain about my lunch because I wasn't that hungry.  The waiter came back and said he noticed I didn't eat and then removed my lunch from the bill.  That's great service to notice and take action.  I left him a tip on what my lunch would've been.   I'd go back and try the brunch but I wouldn't go for lunch again.  Unfortunately.",

    "text": "I've always liked the reviews for Vilka, but because of the prices I held off on going until I had a special occasion to commemorate. That time came last Saturday!  I was very much wanting a pork chop, and the results returned by yelp included Vilka's. My wife had recently mentioned scallops, which is another item on their menu, so it was looking to be a win/win for us. I very much enjoyed the flavor of the pork chop with the toppings. It could have been slightly less done for my taste but well within acceptable. I also enjoyed the vegetable of the day which was Brussels spouts. Since it was an auspicious occasion for us, we also went for dessert. We both chose the creme brulee which we both enjoyed very much.   My only complaint with Vilka's is that the entrance to the restrooms is not disguised in any manner. The dining area itself is dimly lit, which is nice, but the space in front of the restroom doors is very brightly lit, spilling eagerly into the rest of the dining area.",

I am always a big fan of companies that give back to our veteran community. They even brought in an old Jeep that was parked right out front!  I was excited to see that there was a spicy pasta dish but I was a little hesitant to try it for fear that it would be too much but our waitress brought me some of the sauce to try and I loved it. I would highly recommend the spicy pasta with shrimp!  The overall feel of the restaurant was a romantic feel in the evening but there was a good mix of families and couples there.  I overheard from a few people that the brunch is very good here so I will for sure be back to try it.",

It's actually a pretty space but the lighting throws odd shadows that make the room feel cold and the room itself has no warmth to it - maybe hanging fabric or something would help.  Only one other table was taken at 7PM on a Wednesday. The food was mostly good, french onion soup was excellent, salmon sauce tasty but the fish was a bit fishy. The mashed potatoes were literally unseasoned, which was odd. I got the brownie ala mode dessert and it was honestly pretty terrible. The brownies tasted like they came from a box and it was drowned in whipped cream to the point where it was disgusting to eat.  As we were walking out we noted that the atmosphere in the bar was more cozy. If we return I will check it out. I wish some of their lunch items were available at dinner.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this a couple of Saturday nights ago with my wife and another couple for dinner.  The other couple had made reservations for 6:30 and we arrived a little early to Vilka Bistro at 6:15.  Thankfully that wasn't a problem and they gave us the option of waiting at the bar or being seated at our table.  We chose our table and were promptly taken back to it.  The inside of Vilka is nice and very modern looking.  There is a large bar area and then a larger dining room right beside.  On the day that we were there, there also happened to be two large parties.  So there seemed to be a lot of dead space in the restaurant, especially near our table which I would be willing to bet isn't usually that way.  For dinner on this evening I decided to order the ribeye at a medium while my wife went with the fishermans pasta.  The menu describes the ribeye as a 14 oz ribeye made your way (I chose black and blue) served with mashed potatoes and vegetables (squash on this day).  Our food took a little while to get to us and our waitress apologized explaining that we were behind one of the larger parties.  It honestly wasn't long enough that I started to fixate on it but it's good to know that customer service isn't dead.  Shortly after she let us know that our food arrived at the table and both my meal and my wife's looked great.  I can't say that I was too fond of the cook on my meat.  One side was maybe a medium rare (closer to rare than medium) while the other side was pretty rare.  So that means in addition to not being cooked to the proper temp, it was seared poorly too with one side being on longer than the other.  Thankfully I can eat a rare steak even if it isn't my favorite thing and so that is what I chose to do here.  It wasn't the best ribeye that I have had as a lot of the fat hadn't been rendered down which made it somewhat difficult to eat.  What I did enjoy about it was the seasoning and also the blue cheese that was on top.  As for the sides, they were decent.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and tasted good enough while the squash was cooked well and was easy enough to eat.  Th bottom line for me is that I would give it a try again in the future.  While my protein was poorly cooked, my wife's dish looked fantastic and the rest of my meal was cooked well enough that I would give it another try.",

    "text": "I have been waiting a long time for this place to open and when I arrived it did not disappoint. Vilka Bistro opened last week so they are currently in final remodeling stages. You can see some of that when you walk in but don't let that deter you.  I was warmly greeted and given a half booth in the back. As you enter there is a full service bar towards the right. They have their own WiFi. Pass code available upon request.  My waitress Tina, went over the lunch menu and told me what the soup of the day was. I decided to go with the chicken sandwich which came with provolone, avocado, tomato, and more on a bun. All of their sandwiches pair with French Fries but if you are not a fry lover you can swap out for a few of the sides at no extra cost. Those would include your house salad and the vegetable of the day. Today's vegetable was a broccoli, spinach, with radishes. That looked very good so I decided to opt with that. The other sides that require a $2.00 up-charge include asparagus, risotto, and their \"special\" salad.  The menu also has some gluten free items as well as vegetarian options available for choice. I got my lunch fairly quickly and was amazed at how big the sandwich was! Glancing at some of the other tables I could tell that they serve large portions here so you are getting your monies worth.  My broccoli, spinach, radish mix vegetable side was literally top notch and I would highly recommend it. Although the side was small I loved every bit of it. The chicken sandwich was good as well. The only thing was that it was a little tough to bite into.  I got to meet the manager and found out they are open on Sundays which will come in handy for a nice meal on Christmas Eve. There are  limited hours that day however.  My waitress was extremely attentive to my needs and made sure my beverages were taken care of.  This place is a welcome addition to Bethel Park since it is part of the new strip mall that already has a few shops and health clubs here. It also sits conveniently by Sheetz gas and is a short drive to Washington junction T station parking lot. There are plenty of parking spaces since it is on the corner of this strip mall and I normally drive by this area all the time when I am headed south on Rt 88.  Am looking forward to coming here again to try out their dinner menu.",

The Prime rib was better than any steakhouse I have ever been too.  Everything on the brunch buffet was fresh and high quality. And for the grand finale,  the caramel nut cheesecake was fantastic.

    "text": "Like many others in the neighborhood, I had been waiting for the opening of Vilka Bistro. Finally, I had a chance to check it out.  Before going I looked at the reviews and noticed a good bit of them are from lunch, this leads me to wonder if the lunch experience is a different one.  Perhaps I set my standards high, I don't know. Sadly, I just wasn't 'wowed' by Vilka Bistro.  To be fair I'll break down my review.  Upon entering, I thought the decor was awesome, then when I stepped into the main dining area, I thought they were closing. Granted it was late, 9 PM, but the tables were empty, and the room was far too bright. I don't know if it was just this one time or if it is all the time. There are hanging and circular ceiling lights in dining room, perhaps a low wattage, yellow light in the ceiling instead of bright, white, it just gave a harsh feel. Ambience is everything, the design is there, the lighting just through it off.  Our server Beverly was amazing, on top of things and knowledgeable. I liked her a lot, absolutely no complaints and only praise for the service.  The menu selection was small. At least for the entrees, not much to choose from and they had only one choice for a special.  The appetizer prices were high, average $12.00, way above average for the area. The entrees were right on par with some of the nicer places.  Presentation was mostly five star, but somehow I believe they focused on that instead of flavor. We ordered an appetizer of Buffalo chicken dip, it was good, I wouldn't recommend the grilled ciabatta bread, get the chips.  I ordered the fisherman pasta (Pictured), to their credit the shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection, but the sauce, I was told was a light wine, lemon, it was a heavy cream and tasted cheesy. My daughter ordered the lamb bake, she didn't like it. I thought it was tasty. The roasted potatoes looked pretty but lacked any seasoning, the asparagus was tiny and shriveled. My complaint about the lamb was it was supposed to have a mint creme fraiche drizzle, when honestly it tasted more like Tzatiki sauce. We ended up switching entrees.   I am generously giving it a three star because the presentation and service were top notch. Unfortunately, this place wasn't for me.  I hate to beat the place up, they are still new and maybe they'll get better. You may love them, I did not. I wanted to, but didn't and I am not sure I will ever give them a second chance.",

The only thing that is a negative about this place is the atmosphere. The hanging lights look nice, but they're offset by a concrete slab floor and little other decoration.   That said, it's close to home and I have no doubt we'll be back in the future.",

I ordered the autumn salad and with grilled chicken and it was delicious! Everyone said their food was great! I tried my fiance's fries and they were flavorful! Will come back the next time we're in town!",

    "text": "Wow! We had such a great experience our first night out here. We have kept saying that we wanted to try Vilka each time we drive by, and finally got a chance to. We made a reservation on the OpenTable App, which was convenient. We decided to sit outside which was set up very nicely. There is also a fire pit. My only complaint is that the chairs were a bit snug, even for an average size person. All staff was extremely friendly and attentive the entire evening. They have a lot of fun drinks to choose from and have a unique variety of food on the menu. The white sangria was delicious! My boyfriend went with crab cakes and I had their special for the night, butternut squash gnocchi with carrot glaze. I can say this was so delicious I would probably lick my plate if I could, haha! Whatever sauce that was-AMAZING!! My boyfriend loved his crab cakes!  He suggests that the risotto underneath could just have a bit more flavoring. The portion sizes were perfect. We had a great date night and can't wait to return again.",

    "text": "We visited for the first time this week for an early dinner (4:30) and we almost left because there was no one else in the entire restaurant.  Luckily, we decided to give it a try.  Our waitress, Kelly J, was so attentive and made our visit even more enjoyable.  They have a great dinner menu with lots of options.  Kelly showed us the lunch menu too just so we knew for future visits what they offered!  I'm excited to try it for lunch.  I'm gluten free and there were a lot of choices for me.  The gf items are marked on the menu but when I asked if they could make the pork belly gf they did!  It was delicious and a nice sized portion. By the time we were finishing up there were about 4 tables seated so it started to pick up a bit.  This will definitely be on our rotation of restaurants!",

    "text": "I've seen several articles about this new place in the South Hills and we thought we should try it out, as it sounded like an interesting concept. Consequently, four of us decided to give it a trial on a Saturday night. Being Saturday, we made reservations to make sure we could get in. We needed have been too concerned. When we got to the place, our table was ready and we were promptly seated. Throughout the meal, no more than half the tables were ever occupied (on a Saturday night???).   The staff was very friendly and helpful. From the hostess to the waitress, we only got the best of service. They were on the ball, constantly checking if things were going OK, and trying to be as helpful as they could possible be. I suspect that part of it was the lack of other customers though. As a matter of fact, at one point during our meal i happened to glance towards the kitchen to see a whole bunch of the wait staff lined up against the wall and looking at the tables ... to see if anything needed to be done! While that's great of customers, I am not sure what this level of overstaffing means to the long term longevity of the place?  The decor is not quite as industrial as most places these days which is a good thing. It was nice to see a drop down ceiling with sounds absorbing tiles for a change. Unfortunately, those tiles did not help much as the restaurant was piping in music at an extremely loud level. When we first met our waitress, even thought she was standing right next to me, I could not hear her. She raised her voice to almost a shout and we could then converse. We asked her to have the volume reduced and she agreed it was too loud. We never felt a reduction in the noise level and towards the end of our meal, asked to speak to the manager (Michelle). We complained about the noise level and she basically shrugged us off. Not good.  The walls are painted in a dark burgundy color, the furniture is a dark wood, and the lighting was relatively dim (are these restaurants so ashamed of their food that they do not want the customer to see it?). Between the excessive noise, and the darkness of the room, it was not an enjoyable experience even with the great service form our waitress.  We ended up ordering four different dishes from the one page menu. It was nice to see the menu not featuring the same old items from every other restaurant (or Sysco) and we were excited to try the different items. One great thing that they did really well was the each dish was arranged artistically on the plate, so the initial impression was of a beautiful plate! Unfortunately, some errors in the cooking process took away from our enjoyment of the food. Here are the four dishes (also see the pictures I uploaded for how nice they looked!):  Salad with Crab - The salad featured all kinds of veggies and a giant crab cake. Except for bit too much red onion for the taste of our friend who ordered it, it was very good, tasty, and definitely was a very generous meal.  Salmon - This was presented beautifully with a sunny-side egg draped over the salmon piece. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the green beans, sauce, and egg complemented each other very well.  Crab cakes - two of the giant crab cakes placed on a bed of well-cooked risotto. Yum! Added a side order of Asparagus to have some green and was disappointed as the restaurant left the tough woody parts of the stems on the Asparagus, so we had to cut them off ourselves.  Baked Lamb - A bed of roasted potatoes, slices of well-seasoned (but way oversalted!) ground lamb and a fan of the same Asparagus as on the side dishes was a beautiful presentation.  All portions were very ample. Including wine and beers, we ended up spending about $40 per person. Given the nice dishes, and the ampleness of the dishes, this was a very reasonable price.  If some of the cooking errors get fixed, and the noise level reduced to a quarter of what it was during our visit, I would rate this restaurant as amongst the best in the South Hills. I hope they correct these problems.",
