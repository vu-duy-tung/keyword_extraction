I ordered the buffalo chicken salad again a few days ago, still huge  but HOLY HELL it was HOT. WOW. I had to stop midway through and drink a glass of milk and eat a piece of bread. Next time I order I'm going to request to go a tad light on the buffalo sauce. Still a killer salad though! They don't skimp on the toppings or the meat.",

First, the staff at the Coraopolis location are nothing short of tremendous. I probably spent 15 minutes figuring out which wing sauces I would like and I needed their input. They let me taste around 10 different sauces. Therefore, I purchased a number of half dozen wings to get an good representation of the best they have to offer. 'Frank Sinatra', Steel City, 'Talk of Beaver Falls', 'Frankie Valli',and just plain hot. Everything was fantastic, The wings are cooked up crispy and the sauces are unlike anything I've ever had before. I also ordered the \"Heart Attack' hoagie, a pizza, and the bacon ranch cheese tater tots. This place offers more than just wings and they execute everything at a very high level.   These are the best wings I have ever had in the Pittsburgh area and again, they have much more than just wings. I want to thank again the very patient and knowledgeable staff for all of their help. This is primarily a take out place but there are a number of tables/booths if you wish to eat there. I will be heading back soon even though the closest location is nearly an hour away.",

Also, had the chance to try Jamaician Jerk which were OK, but not as good as I was expecting.  Will have to stop back and try some of the others.

They also have some tables indoors if you want to stay there and eat   Quality takes time.  During that time you'll need to read over the menu and decide which of their many flavors you want to put on them.

Since this was my first time there, they let me try different sauces to see what I would like. Customer service always makes me happy!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

I got 6 \"Talk of Beaver Falls\" and 13 \"WESTVIEW CONNECTION\" (BSB's Wet Cajun Garlic with a Green Jalapeno Base). I'll say I was pretty upset i didn't get 13 of the Talk of Beaver Falls, holy elephant sh** were they delicious.  They carried a nice kick but not lip numbing a bit sweet, but smothered by a good heat and a peppercorn kick. I loved it and THAT was well worth the price.The Westview connection was alright. A bit on the dry salty side but great flavor and a good amount of spice.  The only thing holding this back from a solid 5 stars is the wing size and the price- They just don't line up.  Inexpensive wing--small--OK man Expensive wing--Big -- Cool Expensive wing-- Not big-- Not cool man  That's my formula. However, BSB's adds a variable making it: Expensive wing--not big--very tasty--Sure thing dude.  So I'm alright with it, it's well worth the price for the right flavor. I'd recommend getting a side of fries and lapping up the excess sauce, screw KFC - THIS is finger lick'n good.",

We then got the Cool Runnings wings, Pigeon wings, Talk of Beaver Falls, and the Uncle Nick's wings. They were all very unique flavors and definitely like none I've ever had. The Talk of Beaver Falls was really spicy and so were the Uncle Nick's. But they were all super delicious!!

    "text": "These wings are tremendous!   Big Shot Bob's is a hole-in-the-wall, mostly takeout place. There are a few tables, but it's not really a cozy place to eat. The guys at the counter were very friendly and there is a TV in there. However, these wings are incredible. I'd eat them in a box, with a fox, on a boat or with a goat.  First of all, you've got all kinds of flavor options. I had the Frank Sinatra which is covered in blue cheese, hot sauce, and parmesan cheese. I also had the Talk of Beaver Falls which was spicy and tangy in a unique way. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My wife tried one that had sauce and garlic and it was fresh chopped garlic chunks! AWESOME.  You can add on a bed of fries under the wings and slathered in sauce. After doing this, I'd recommend just getting a side of fries separately. There is likely to be plenty of sauce to dip anyway, and this will give you an option for something to cool your mouth if you get a spicy flavor. The fries are fresh cut style and very good however you serve them.  Your best bet is to call in a pick up order, arrive early enough to pick them up as soon as they're ready, and head home to enjoy! You can't split flavors in an order, but it's amazing how filling six of these wings can be. For an average person, I'd suggest two orders of six and pick two flavors. There are more than 100 flavors, so if you do this every day it will take about two months to try them all!  I can't wait to be back in town to try more!",

(super nice!) and given suggestions based on our preferences (medium spicy, not sweet/sugary)  Ended up going with (in order of amazing to only slightly less amazing)  Uncle Rico Pigeon Frank Sinatra Uncle Nicks.   As previously stated in other reviews, probably on the expensive side for the size of wings, but still...   Cash only.   I will absolutely be returning.",

I got the Walk of Beaver Falls (spicier than the Talk of version) and I was impressed by how the heat builds as you keep eating them. As a spice addict, I was surprised how quickly I ran out of water while eating these wings.  The Boyfriend got wings with Bob's Signature Hot sauce on them, and his only complaint was that the sauce was a little too salty for his taste.  Tater tots were good as well, and you get a HUGE plate full of them.  Perhaps the best reason to come back, though, is the staff. They're thoughtful and funny, and they anticipate what you need before you even know you need it.",

He told me it was good but my other option was a better choice \"Black Magic.\" He was very helpful and his suggestion was on point cause the wings was kicking like Van Dam in the movie \"Bloodsport\". In other words whenever I'm in to this will be my must stop for some great food and cool people. I will advise anyone to go and try the many different flavor combination they have.

    "text": "Yum.  I'm a wing junkie (as any buffalo girl should be) so I was excited to try someplace that boasts so many flavors!    The menu is actually a little overwhelming because there are so many variations.  But on closer inspection a lot of the flavors are just minor variations of others (just adding or changing one ingredient).  I ordered late on a Monday night (9:30) so I was surprised my order was going to take a half hour.  Apparently that is a standard wait time as I asked about it when I came to pick up my wings.  Not a big deal, but a longer wait time then a lot of similar pizza/wing places.  The wings were done perfectly and had a lot of sauce.  I was happy about this because a lot of places don't give you much.  The amount of extra sauce goes perfect with an order of fries (you can order them on the side or you can order your wings on a bed of fries).  The fries appear to be fresh cut and a pretty thick.  They had a great flavor and were cooked to perfection.    I rated this three stars because of the price that everything ends up being.  The wings were very tasty and they listen to specific directions well (I like my wings done extra crispy).  But wings are almost $7 for six of them and that doesn't include the blue cheese or celery (which are $1 each extra).  Other places that serve wings for comparable prices include the celery and blue cheese for that price.  On the plus side, at least they have celery and blue cheese as an option (because a lot of Pittsburgh restaurants don't).  A great choice for an order of wings.  Definitely someplace I'll try again.  I just wish the wings and celery were included in the price.",

    "text": "Billy Joel once complained to his delicious chicken wings: \"you had to be from Big Shot, didn't you.\" Driving 4 hours for wings seems insane when you live in Buffalo, but Bob's makes it almost worth it.  What to get: Wings (Old Bay - Wet)  These are simply the best wings I've ever had outside of Buffalo (the home of wings, and rightly so). In fact, were they in Buffalo, they'd be one of the best wing spots there too, believe it or not. They're not just the best in Pitt.. they're some of the best anywhere.  I highly recommend you get the Old Bay, Wet. Which means they are dripping in butter (shush, if you're eating wings you're not eating healthy anyway so get over it and let your heart worry about it), and seasoned to perfection with dark delicious maroon-crimson-reddish Old Bay seasoning. Every wing will rock your world, and you'll wish you had ordered more.  Speaking of which, I love that they'll make you just 5 wings (for 6 or so dollars) instead of making you order a full 10 (like most wing places in Buffalo do). If Old Bay isn't your thing, they have, ooh, about 50 other combinations for you to choose from. Take it from this connoisseur... these are some of the best wings you'll ever eat, and all three of their locations make them equally perfectly.  So when your friends say \"where are the best wings in town?\" and some fool offers up suggestions such as Hooters or BW3 (eww), then learn from that Richard Dreyfus movie and scream out \"WHAT ABOUT BOB'S?\"",

So, placed the order and they said it was a hour to a hour and a half wait for delievery. No big deal, they did deliver within the hour. I took our bag and noticed that two of our boxes were covered in plastic wrap because they were dripping sauce and it got everywhere. We also order ranch to go with our wings and there was no ranch. I called back (within 5 minutes of the driver leaving) to see if the driver was still in our area so he could turn around and bring them back. The next woman I talked to said the driver was already gone and it would take a hour and half to two hours to bring ranch. I told her we paid $1.50 for the ranch and she said we can credit your next order. I told her we're visiting and won't be ordering again. So not only did we not get our ranch, our fries were cold and looked like they were burned, and I gave the driver a $5.00 tip. The only reason I'm even giving a star partially because I can't leave a review without it and the other half is because the wings actually had a good flavor.",

I looked at the menu and was a little flabbergasted from all the wing sauce choices.    Needless to say, these wings were on point. I tried the mr. North side sauce which was excellent. I'm sure it's not the healthiest meal, (as the wings sit on top of fries and are covered in your choice of sauce) but they were delicious. Perfect for the occasional indulgence.     Overall, I was very happy with my meal and had a great experience. It was takeout so I can't speculate on what it's like to dine in. Either way, we will try it again.",

    "text": "Stopped at Big Shot Bobs with my son tonight. It's a small eat in establishment on a corner lot. The parking lot is small, and can be difficult to maneuver if they're busy, or you drive a large vehicle.  The dining room was fairly clean.  Ordering is done at the counter.  Then menu was typical for a pizza / wing joint. They had a handful of run of the mill sandwiches, and standard pizza options.... But we were there for wings.  They had an impressive selection of wing sauces - all the normals, and as many 'in house' special sauces. The wings only come in quantities of 6, 13, and 50.  Want more than one sauce?? Have to buy 50 (or order in multiples of 6 or 13.). The wings are pricey, in my opinion... A 6 count will run you $6.49.  13, $12.99.  And 50, 46.99.    I ordered 13 of the 'Talk of Beaver Falls,' and my son got 13 mild buffalo.  I asked for two Fountain drinks, but the fountain was down.  We got an off brand orange soda. And a water.  They did tell us wings take approximately 20 minutes to make. We also ordered a large fry and sat down to wait.  The dining area has about 6 booths and 2 tables.  It's decor was dated, it had the 'greasy spoon' feel.  A roll of paper towels were the decoration placed on each tabletop.  There is one TV in the dining room, and it faces the counter.  It was turned up far too loud.  The fries came out first.  They're long and thick, fried and coated in a seasoned salt.  The portion was plenty for the both of us.  Before we could finish the fries, our wings came out.    They're served in a diner type basket, lined and wrapped in tin foil.  The wings weren't tossed in the sauce, but rather it was dumped on top of them. There was a ton of sauce in the basket, but you had to stir the wings around to fully coat them.  They were hot (temperature), and the sauce did not disappoint.  The wings were a little over done.... On the acceptable side of overdone.... A little too crispy.    The wings were a great size... They were individual pieces, but were far too large to call them wingdings.  My son and I ate, and I headed to settle up.  THIS IS A CASH ONLY ESTABLISHMENT.  They have an ATM in the building, but will not accept cards.    Our bill was $36.  We both left full, but it still seems a little steep.   I would go back again...   A five star rating if the wings weren't slightly over done, and they accepted cards.",

    "text": "Had an intense craving for wings after work one night and checked on Yelp to see that Big Shot Bob's was the closest wing place with postive reviews.  Ordered the Talk of Beaver Falls (one of their bestsellers) and William Henry Harrison (jamaican jerk and parmesan cheese).    I thought the wings were crispy, fresh, tender and of decent size but I wasn't a huge fan of the flavors I chose.  The Talk of Beaver Falls tasted like your're traditional wings with Frank's Red Hot and the William Henry Harrison was greasier than I would have liked.  I mean I get it, wings are greasy but there wasn't much flavor on the William Henry Harrison wings because they seemed covered in oil and whatever seasoning that was used slipped right off.    Maybe I chose the wrong flavors but I wouldn't be opposed to trying them again.  I'm still a huge fan of the wings at Birmingham Bridge Tavern and they are my fave to date!",
