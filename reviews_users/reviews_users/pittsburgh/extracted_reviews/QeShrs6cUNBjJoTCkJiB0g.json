Long before the open kitchen concept became a hot topic, this cook's line has turned out many a quality  plate over the years.",

    "text": "Legends of the North Shore on the top 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh list? I would have to disagree. I joined a three dining companions for dinner on a recent Friday night. When I walked in, I was shocked by how incredibly tiny it is inside. We were crammed at a table next to a large party. Our server was very matter of fact and to the point. What I would expect eating at a dinner, not a nice Italian restaurant. I decided to order the Penne Vodka with prosciutto and the wedding soup. The soup was nothing memorable. I enjoyed the crisp bread (foccacia) and oil better. When the entree's arrived, I was surprised that my Penne vodka was garnished with prosciutto. I assumed from the menu that there would be more proscuitto than a thin two inch slice on top of the dish. Overall, the sauce was very good. Not too creamy, not to tomatoey. However, I enjoyed my husband's gnocchi bolognese much more. The gnocchi was tender and the sauce was flavorful and meaty. All in all, I doubt I will be heading back to Legends. With so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh, Legends doesn't make my list.",

I most recently was there on this past Saturday, which I don't recommend showing up on a Saturday without reservations,  we got the last two seats at the bar and were lucky to get those.  We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.  They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good Italian meal.  The service here is very good too, and very friendly.  If you want a good home cooked Italian meal and warm, friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you.",

The food is so savory and just melts in your mouth.  You can't go wrong with the specials.  My only complaints (which are minor) are that parking can be a bit of an issue (street parking only) and for the love of god, you need to make reservations (they get a bit shirty with you if you don't).  But these are so minor, I don't even think they affect my rating at all.  The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is wonderful.",

It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.  PS The 7:00 reservation called to say they were going to be late so we were allowed to relax at the table till 7:30.",

We needed this food and togetherness for this time in our lives. Thank you! I had the spinach ravioli, and I'm still thinking about the flavors three weeks later, back home in Long Beach, CA!

We started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.  They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.  My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.  Overall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.",

Pros: -Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order. -Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal.  -Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring. -Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.  Cons: -Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions.  -Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall.  -No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.  Overall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia!",

The service was a little slow on some things like refilling our water glasses or taking our orders but nothing to complain about as they were super busy.  We enjoyed the extra time to talk and catch up with our dinner friends.  Once the food orders were taken, the food came out quickly and correctly.  Plus it was delicious.  We had 4 people total.  We split 2 appetizers, a cheese and charcuterie board special and the Norma.  Both were good, not great but solid enough.  The main dishes were tremendous.  Two folks got a salmon and shrimp ravioli special which they raved about (and I tried and agreed).  One got a blackened shrimp special and I got the Mussels Bianco but chose the red sauce and paid the up charge for the Hell sauce.  I dreamed about it the next day, it was that good.  We topped off the evening with some canoli's.  Chef Dan's wife makes most of the desserts (except the canoli's we found out later).  Chef Dan even stopped by at the end of the night.

This was delicious, increasing my already high expectations. Our waitress came back- I ordered the Penne Vodka and unfortunately was overwhelmingly disappointed.   The sauce, although good, is simply ordinary. I've been to countless Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and could name at least 20 better than Legends.    Had Legends not received substantial praise I may have not been so disappointed, but when you're touted as one of the best I expect nothing short. To their benefit the restaurant is BYOB, maybe this gets so much praise because everyone's drunk before their meal is served...  Food C+, Service B-",

Salad looked very nice, although they were stingy on the dressing, also only have 2 kind of dressings; Balsamic and ranch. Soups could have been a bit more full in the cups. I had the fettuccine Alfredo, and it was in all honesty an average meal of fettuccine, wasn't too impressed with it. But hey, if you're looking to try something new and don't mind spending a few extra bucks, give it a try!",

    "text": "So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....  When a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.  I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....  I ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....  Would I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?",

    "text": "Update:  Chef Dan read my review (below) and was kind enough to refund the meal. As stated in my original review I should have sent the meal back right away, so that part is on me. Great quality customer service.   When I go which is probably about a half-dozen times a year for the past several years.  I usually just order the Beans and Greens.  This past Friday evening I did something different, I ordered the special which sounded divine.  Blackened ahi tuna with two different kinds of ravioli asparagus and mushrooms topped with artichoke hearts covered with a cream sauce.  Well when the dish arrived I thought it was my dinner companion's meal because all I saw at first was the ravioli.  My friend was confused as well because she thought the fish, the tuna was replaced with salmon, was an unripe tomato.  It was in fact the smallest piece of salmon I had ever been served in a restaurant barring a piece of salmon sushi.  My friend joked that maybe because I was wearing a kimono jacket they thought I want a bonsai salmon.  Now I blame myself for not sending it back, this is what I should have done.  Now it gets worse.  The bill comes, my dish was $36.  Sticker shock and disappointment to say the least.  Given that the entrees at Legend's are in the $18-25 range I thought that the high-end of that range would be the price of this special.  Ah well Legend's if I do return I will go back to the Beans and Greens.  If you go and are tempted to order the special, ask the price.",

The atmosphere is unpretentious with a friendly neighborhood vibe - there were obviously lots of happy regulars.   The food was great from start to finish. We started with the hot antipasto and the greens & beans, which were perfectly seasoned. My dining partner, who has a less adventurous palate, was very happy with her spaghetti and meatballs. I got the halibut special, which was flaky and tender with a delicious apricot chutney, served over arugula. We decided to split a house made cannoli for dessert, which was warm and gooey and just plain yummy. I'll definitely be back!",

After picking up two bottles of red at Wine and Spirits on Ohio Street, my team and I got a table at the warm, homey Legends of the North Shore, where it's BYOB. For appetizers we ordered the margherita bruschetta (best choice), fried polenta, and greens 'n beans (mainly because we went on a Tuesday when they had a special deal for 99 cents with any entree). The focaccia bread is great with the homemade mixture of olive oil and herbs.   I ordered the mussels bianca over linguine--terrific. Also comes with shrimp. The portions are generous but delicious, in part because it's clear that the tomato sauces are all made fresh and in-house. I tried my coworkers gnocchi--good, but I was quite satisfied with my own dish. My coworker who ordered the eggplant parmigiano really enjoyed her dish as well.",

    "text": "One of my favorites - unpretentious fine dining! Reservations are a really good idea on the weekends. I was just here - we started with the beans and greens which are outstanding - they have a food truck dedicated to this dish that makes the rounds of the 'burgh. Warm flatbread (focaccia) with rosemary is served with all meals , yum! I had their spots, which are so tender, light, tasty and never fishy. Served with great mashed taters and a fresh veggie mix, all great. Partner had their pasta special, which is pricey (for Legends, not for other places) because it's essentially 2 dinners on one 16\" platter! This was salmon over 2 types of ravioli, with peppers etc. in a white wide cream sauce. Partner requested no cream - no problem - they'll do whatever it takes to make you happy! The service is outstanding, it's BYOB, the salads are very tasty (I forgot to include those) as are the soups,the main courses are sublime. But wait! The desserts are homemade, and super! Coconut cream pie a mile high, triple chocolate cake a 1/4 mile high, and others - but I usually get one of those two. And wait - you get complimentary fudge (chocolate or peanut butter - or both) at the end of the meal. A lot of excellent food in a very comfortable environment, moderately priced. What's not to love??",

I had The Godfather (salami, pepperoni, prosciutto, and provolone on their housemade focaccia). It was pretty alright! My favorite part was the top and bottom layers of salami that had been crisped under a salamander or in the oven, like a pepperoni cup on a great pizza.   Their focaccia is good...better if dipped in salt, pepper, Parmesan, and olive oil.   Others got the Cajun chicken sandwich, the pasta of the day (tortellini) and fettuccine Alfredo, and every single plate was empty when the waitress came to clear the table.   It's tiny and it filled up not long after they opened, but the service is fast and the food is worth it!  Oh, and they give you fudge at the end of the meal. Very homey feel to this place!",

    "text": "Will never return to this place. Expensive and rude. Was asked to leave during dessert because there were other parties waiting that had reservations.  I had dinner there with a couple of business associates, while we were celebrating her birthday. Ordered some fish which in my opinion was very overpriced for the portion size. It was a tasty meal but I have had much better. Word has it that the Gnocchi is frozen, not homemade.  Our table was right next to the radiator and it was so hot in there that it felt like we were sitting in a sauna. The waitress graciously adjusted the temperature, though it was still really uncomfortable.  The most ridiculous part though, was being asked to leave shortly after the waitress brought us our dessert. We were informed by a different waitress that other parties were waiting and that had reservations. We were right in the middle of dessert when we were notified. Not once during the phone conversation was I notified that there was a time limit on our dinner reservation. This was completely embarrassing to me, as I was the one who recommended the place. Oh, and the place charges a corking fee to cork our own wine (Its BYOB).  Dinner for 3 people was $110 before tip and this was with no appetizers or alcoholic drinks since we brought our own. Not in all my years of dining have I ever been asked to leave a restaurant. We were polite and not belligerent in any way.. Being asked to leave is completely unacceptable. The restaurant should give a disclaimer to people during the reservation process if they want to put a time limit on their dining experience. This place came highly recommended but I am completely perplexed as to why it has good reviews. If I could give it my own star rating it would be a big FAT ZERO.",

The food is great, nice atmosphere, and amazing staff.  I tried the antipasto the first day, and loved it.  Warm focaccia bread with dipping oil was brought to the table.  Tasty!!!!! The next day I had the spinach ravioli, and that's what I stuck with the remainder of the week.  The sauce is really one of the better ones I've had.  I loved it.  I tried the cannoli, caramel butter pecan cake, and chocolate layer cake.  All amazing, and all huge!  It gets crazier.  They walk around offering pieces of fudge after your meal.  It was really a calm and comforting break for me in the middle of some very stressful days.  Shout out to Janet who works there and is awesome.  I'm from the area, but currently live in TN.  I'll make sure to stop by next time I'm home for a visit.",

    "text": "I'm pretty much committed to trying EVERY BYOB restaurant around so this was on my list for a long time. Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on.   Now, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here.   The place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max.   Food on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. \"Mama's gravy\", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside.   Sorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today. Plus, I thought if I worked down the block, I'd probably come here for lunch. But never would I go out of my way to go here.",

It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.  I wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order.   That was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'  Hubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner. Starter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that.   Overall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street.",

    "text": "I spend a lot of time on the North Side, so I'd been meaning to try this place for a while. My boyfriend and I went in on a Tuesday around 7:30 PM, and we were the only people in the house.  The food:  I tried a house special dish of the day - It was a blackened flank steak over penne with peppers, sun-dried tomatoes in a gorgonzola cream sauce. The dish was excellent, the right combination of sweet, salty, and savory, and the steak was on point. It came with a house salad that was a delicious blend of fresh greens with olives, peppers, tomatoes, the like. It also included grilled bread with a bottle of olive oil and Parmesan cheese for dipping.  My boyfriend ordered the Veal Parm, it also tasted great, but it was nothing outstanding.  Tuesday is there \"Greens and Beans\" for 99 cents special, so we also gave that a whirl. It was decent, lacked some flavor, but I wouldn't order it again.  The Staff:  Service was excellent, our waitress was attentive and answered all of our dumb questions. You can also see the cooks making the good, all around they seemed pleasant.  The Ambience: We were not aware this was an \"upscale\" Italian restaurant; from the vibe, the name, and the decor, you'd think standard Pittsburgh food. True to the name \"Legends\" the walls were lined with your staple Pittsburgh sports news clippings. The whole place was tiny, so the tables and chairs followed suit. I would by no means have minded the ambience of the food matched the theme- but it was a $20 average plate place, and I would have appreciated the vibe to match. They also placed terribly loud, out-of-date pop hits I could have lived without. Even silence would be better.   All around, the food was great, not excellent, but overpriced for the setting and ambience. I would recommend and I may go again. Also, be weary - it's BYOB with a $4/person corking fee.",

Only complaint is that the prices can be rather expensive for the basics, especially since the portions are on the smaller side ($18 for a small bowl of alfredo with little chicken). Update: They increased their prices so now alfredo is $21.50!",

The homey/intimate environment makes you feel like you are in your parents living room waiting for a home cooked meal from your mom.   Of the 4 times I've been here, I don't have any complaints. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I'm usually not a fan of getting chicken when I dine out, but the Chicken Romano and Chicken Cacciatore are on point. Chef Dan's greens and beans are delicious as well, and I can't complain about the warm focaccia bread they bring out before dinner.  It is BYOB, so make sure you bring your own bottle if wine. There is a small corkage fee, usually around $4 a person.   They have some sort of special going on every night during the week. Monday is couples night which is dinner for 2 for $30, Tuesday is .99 cent greens and beans with an entree, Wednesday there is no corkage fee, and Thursday is ladies night. Be sure to make a reservation if you can, weekends fill up fast.  All in all one of my favorite dining spots on the North Side for a special occasion.",

Everyone got their meals almost at the same time (which is very hard for a small restaurant with a big group).  The people were professional and friendly.  The BYOB allowed us to have wine that suited everyone's taste.  They did the pasta and non-pasta dishes very well.    This small restaurant is a gem in an up and coming neighborhood.

    "text": "Yay! I finally got to try Legends North Shore after having the place booked mark for a few months now and so can cross this place off my list. After walking in, Legends North Star is small but homey which was nice. The place was not filled so we had our pick of tables. Our waitresses were sweet and did not kick us out after we remained at our table to finish wine 30 minutes after closing.   Legends North Shore provides bread to munch on. Crunchy airy pieces that don't fill you up entirely before the entree which I so often do and they provide a bottle with seasoned olive oil (which was kind of oily on the outside). I tried the Tuesday 99 cent green and beans special along with a salad and spaghetti and meatballs. I wasn't sure what the green and beans were but they were cheesy and salty but very watery. I thought they were tasty but confused if what I ate were indeed what greens and beans were suppose to be. The salad was fresh but nothing special, and I felt the same for the spaghetti and meatballs (made in house from the meatball to the pasta). I feel that when you go to an Italian restaurant you can judge how well they cook based on classic dishes. I couldn't stop eating the spaghetti and meatballs though I felt full half way through. I thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was - ~$18 ($17 for spaghetti and meatballs and $.99 for the greens and beans plus some tax). Maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to $13 or $14 or so it would be more reasonable imho. Also points are deducted for the corkage fee of $4 per person, not per bottle. We were not aware so they basically made an easy $16 bucks from the four of us at dinner.",

Their greens and beans is a special treat, with lots of flavor -- an excellent side dish for my main dish, spaghetti and meatballs. Now I would not usually order this at most \"Italian\" restaurants, but Chef Dan does an excellent job with perfectly cooked pasta, a fresh marinara sauce, and a huge, tasty meatball.  And to wrap up, I just HAD to have the caramel apple pie a-la-mode.  I don't normally have dessert, but I've SEEN and HAD this pie before.  Yummy!

    "text": "Legends of the North Shore is great.  Great food and so much fun.  My family has been here twice (for my little brother's birthday and my dad's birthday) and the whole family loves it.  Legends is definitely a hidden gem and is very very casual.  At first walking up to it, I was a little unsure from the outside if we made a good choice in picking the restaurant.  Its definitely a small hole in the wall place but the food is so authentic so the whole vibe works together! One awesome thing about the small size and set up of Legends is that you can see into the kitchen while they cook.  It makes you feel like you are in a family kitchen!  All the food is great but I would say what makes this place even better is the atmosphere in the place.  You can tell everyone around you is relaxed and having a good time (the BYOB-ness of the restaurant probably helps this!).  But overall, as long as you are not looking for a 'fancy night' out, Legends is a fun and authentic Italian experience!",

They start you off with some super fresh (I mean directly out of the oven) bread with olive oil and herbs amazing. I went with the Blackened Shrimp and loved every bite. It had a great flavor and just a small amount of heat on the pasta. I was also pleasantly surprised with my  salad before my pasta. Great field greens and veggies.  The service hear is friendly and I LOVED that all the servers and hostesses helped each other out. We finished the meal with a bite of homemade fudge that our server brought us. So good!! Be sure to come to Legends! I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "So I was super skeptical of Legends of the North Shore.  My buddies from work have gone dozens of times and I've always refused thinking that I'd probably be stuck eating a salad if I went.  Well... I was wrong.  Legends has gluten free pasta available!    The interior is rather small and it gets really busy; however, this does not influence the service.  Our main waitress was a delight.  She made small talk AND she really understood what it means to be gluten free.  She was on it!  I love being able to talk to a waitress that really knows her stuff and that is exactly what I got.  I ended up getting the gluten free pasta with vodka sauce (and prosciutto) and a side salad.  Let me just say, the vodka sauce is some of the best sauce I have EVER had and the pasta was cooked perfectly( which as you guys know is a difficult ask).  I loved it and am ashamed that I stayed away so long.    Definitely give it a try :D",

But after I looked it up and looked at the menu I realized this was a classic old-school Italian restaurant. We showed up without reservations and ended up having to sit at the counter.  I actually really liked our seat. Service was wonderful. Everybody was super nice and the menu selections are solid. We both had the salmon special. Everything was cooked to perfection. We also had beans and greens with Italian sausage. Outstanding. This is not a fancy place, so people looking for a four star off the charts experience should go elsewhere. This is for people who want a family style casual Italian dining experience with very good food. Highly recommend.",

Even more disappointing was the service!!!  Our waitress was very matter of fact - not at all friendly or welcoming!!!!!  She really needs to find something she enjoys doing!!!!!!   I had planned to take a few of my friends there for dinner in the coming days, but now I certainly will not!!!

    "text": "I was out and about on a Saturday afternoon with a good friend and we were in the north side area and he suggested that we eat at \"Legends of the North Side\" since he heard it was good.  We walked into the door and there was a woman standing near the door and she shot us a look of surprise (or frustration) and asked if we had a reservation? Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised at this question since the place was empty but within a half hour I totally understood why.  This small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  This establishment is just lovely and was clean and was decorated for the holiday season.  It was cozy.   The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.     The service was excellent.. we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  Our bread basket never remained empty either.  We ordered the \"beans and greens\" as an appetizer and it was delicious. My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was \"almost\" as good as hers - which is saying a lot.      I had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.   It was very tasty but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious.  My friend ordered the Walleye and was very pleased.  The tossed salad that came with my entree was just the right size and everything was fresh. Fresh greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.   By the time we were ready to leave there wasn't an empty table in the place.   The restaurant is located on the corner at a very convenient location in North side with parking available on the street right outside the restaurant. Getting back on 279 was a snitch.   The restroom doors were so festive and unique that I couldn't resist taking a picture !!   The restrooms were also clean too.  I love restaurants that aren't \"chains\" and have their own flair .. and this establishment has that!   I am very happy we decided to have dinner at Legends of the North Shore and will no doubt be visiting again ...   Bravo !",

I was really fortunate to get seated without having a reservation on a Friday night but I think the fact that I was dining alone helped.   I ordered the mussels bianco which came with a soup or salad to start. I opted for the salad which was pretty basic but I have no complaints since it was kind of free. The vegetables were fresh and the vinaigrette was light and tart. The bread here is really tasty with a hint of what I think is rosemary - it had a nice toasted crisp and paired great with the olive oil. I mean bread and olive oil is a classic combination that you cannot go wrong with. I ate the entire basket all by myself!   I chose the red sauce VS white sauce when it came to my mussels bianco. Despite being told to pretty much avoid seafood in Pittsburgh - the mussels and the shrimp that came with the pasta weren't bad! Usually when mussels aren't fresh it has a really gritty texture but all the mussels I got were big and yummy. The linguine was cooked a little past the al dente texture that I preferred but overall it didn't hinder from the dish too much. I really enjoyed the flavor of the red sauce and thought it had a great kick. The portion was so big I had to get a to-go box. I dug into the box later on that night though because it was so good.",

As other reviewers said, it's probably wise to call ahead as the restaurant itself is extremely small and cramped - just how an old-school italian joing should be!  We were seated promptly in the back corner with our bottles of wine and brought out fresh baked bread.  Next, we ordered the mussles in the red sauce.  These are the biggest, juiciest mussles I have ever had - they were delicious and I could've drank the sauce with a straw!  I ordered the chicken scallopini and my date had the blackened shrimp pasta.  Both of our meals were cooked to absolute perfection and tasted delicious.  I've already reccommended Legends to a number of my friends.  It's not somewhere I've heard of before, but it's definitely somewhere I would revisit in a heartbeat.

It was good, but not out of the ordinary, in its Italian-American fare.  We ordered a Bruschetta appetizer for four to start. Now this was the best item of the meal! It was served in a round portion, resembling a pizza. Very tasty and high recommended.  For my main course, I ordered the Spaghetti & Meatball. It came with a thick tomato sauce called \"Mama's Gravy\". (\"Gravy\" is a common Italian-American name for pomodoro sauce in Pennsylvania and other areas of the East Coast.) A single large meatball in the middle. Very good, but not with the zestiness I had anticipated in this setting. A tossed salad was included. One must request ground pepper for the salad and parmesan cheese for the main.  We did not go for a dessert, but by the look of those served to other tables, the portions are huge!  If I were to come again, I would try one of the veal dishes.  Legends of the North Shore is located in the North Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, north of the Allegheny River from downtown. Reservations are a must on weekends.",

This wouldn't be a big deal except that I was never notified of the cancellation. I acknowledge that this may have been an Uber Eats issue, but when we called Legends to resolve the issue, we were met with gross incompetence in the form of denying any responsibility, an aggressive tone, and never given contact to a manager despite multiple requests. Mistakes happen, but the level of unprofessionalism and apathy we were met with was appalling.",

Their signature dipping oil is fabulous!  We ordered a marguerite bruschetta to share - there was plenty and although it came with a healthy serving of marinara, that dipping oil did the trick for me, again!  Two of us ordered their lump crab pasta special.  Pasta was penne and it included artichoke and roasted peppers.  Very good and enough for lunch.  Hubs ordered the gnocchi and was a fan.  Friend ordered Scallopini and I gotta say, he was the winner!  Beautiful dish, well presented and he claimed it was beautiful the whole way through.  Being Tuesday it was Greens & Beans in a small side for $1 - what a deal, they were A++!  Here comes dessert:  Two of us got the triple chocolate cake and loved it.  Caution:  It is dark chocolate, not uber sweet.  One order of butter pecan cake that was loved.  I ordered the coconut cream cake and was the only one disappointed...  It was a heavy yellow custard, just not my favorite.  Parking:  Street Service:  Excellent Atmosphere:  quite casual  We would definitely all go back!",

I would stay away from this dish. When we received the bill the prices were all higher on the bill than the menu. We were too embarrassed to make a deal out of it. For example byob said 2.50 pp in the menu and was 4$ on the bill. Everything a dollar or two off from the menu.   I thought the vibes were cool and I like a rustic italian places with an open kitchen. We would prob go back on a night with some specials. Otherwise better italian in PITT for this price range-even byob.",

    "text": "I was shocked at how good the Penne Vodka was for the price.  While it isn't a \"bargain\" plate, I was really surprised at how fantastic it was!!  I judge a place by its Penne Vodka and previously only one other restaurant in Pittsburgh have I found who makes it decently.  Legends, however, tastes just like homemade New York vodka sauce.  The place is small, so I would suggest making a reservation ahead of time.  We went on a Friday night with a group of 9 people.  My only negatives is that they will not split a bill with a certain amount of people at the table and charged everyone at the table for drinking (when I didn't, because I don't drink alcohol).  The waitresses also seemed to not enjoy their job and be really annoyed.  I don't know, maybe that's part of the attempt to make you feel like you're sitting in a real Italian restaurant in Queens, but they definitely played the part.  The place is BYOB with a corking fee.  The chef came out and he was really nice and he didn't give off the vibe of \"I'm just trying to make you feel special by coming out here\" but more of a \"I needed to stretch my legs and wanted to see how the food was going over with the customers.\"  I plan on coming back to Legends of the North Shore.  The service wasn't bad enough to turn me off from the food, but I've read a few reviews who complained about poor service so I hope they find a way to improve!",

I was there with my mom, dad, grandma, and my brother.  For appetizers, we got fries mozzarella and beans and greens.  I enjoyed the fried mozzarella and the beans and greens were good.  Fresh baked bread came with oil and it was fantastic.  I ordered the mussels Bianco with a side salad.  Everyone apart from my dad enjoyed their sides.  My dad got wedding soup and said that it was just okay.  He also said that about his veal parmesan.  Other than that, we were all happy with our meals.  My brother liked his spaghetti and meatballs, my grandma enjoyed her gnocchi, and my mom loved the spinach ravioli.  I liked my mussels bianco.  It was the first time that I had had mussels and they were excellent.  The noodles were great.  The shrimp was big and full of flavor, and it was completed with a subtle, but enjoyable spice.  At the end of our meal, we were offered chocolates and they were good.  Additionally, the service was fantastic and the waitress really seemed like she cared about each table she waited on.  All in all, a great Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh that offers plenty of great taste and an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Oh my... Ohhh my....   So, I would rate the food here a 5 star, but MAN can they mess up service. I came in to get takeout dinner after visiting someone in the hospital. They were packed, but the waitress 1 tells me to take a seat at the counter and she would be back with me.   10 minutes later, waitress 2 says, do you need a drink while you wait for your food, and I explain that she never came back to get my order. So waitress 2 goes and gets waitress 1. I give waitress 1 my order, and waitress 2 stops her half way through and specifies that she needs to use the togo menu prices. She says ok ok and I assume that is what she has done. I pay my bill and ask for the itemized receipt (because I wanted to make sure that she put no pasta with the chicken parm). Waitress 2 comes over and looks at the itemized receipt and gets obviously mad, asks for my card back, refunds my money and re-rings it in at togo prices.  Then, I ask again if the chicken parm will have veg instead of pasta and both waitress 1 and 2 say yes.   My food comes up, I ask again if the chicken parm has veg instead of pasta and waitress 1 looks in the bag and says yep then staples the bag shut... UMMMM redflag!  So I am waiting on something and I open the bag... There is pasta and no veg. Now, normally I wouldn't care, but this lady already messed up the price, and I asked about it about 50 times, so I was annoyed....So was waitress 2, she comes over and grabs the bag and walks to the kitchen and demands veg. She also adds bread to the bag because waitress 1 didn't put any in AND gives me a gift card for $10 off my next purchase.   As for the food. My ravioli was great, my husband liked the chicken parm, the veg was good, salads were average-small, bread was really good, and the fried parm was better than most.   It is sad that one bad employee can color an experience so much. I think I will go back, just to see if this is a regular or one time thing.",

    "text": "Very solid and respectable 4 stars for Legends (for a place to be 5 stars it has to blow my mind, and while Legends didn't, it was really good; i'd 100% return).  We had company visiting for the weekend and I love Italian food.  Friends too had recommended Legends to us, so we went there.   Pro Tips: 1) Call to make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday night.  They are quaint and very busy and you need to call the day before if you wanna go either of those nights. 2) Expect when you make that reservation to be asked something like \"is 90 minutes enough for you guys?\" Legends runs their place like clockwork, super-efficiently, so this is not the kind of place to sit down and mosey through your meal.  There needs to be a little efficiency on your end too. 3) Also this place is BYOB (or wine).   We had a 6:45 reservation for a party of 3 and after waiting a few minutes for our table, one of the wait-staff said \"So, it's just going to be about 10 minutes or so.  There's been a slight mix-up but we're on it\" and she apologized.  Our wait ended up being about 30 minutes, but only because the people who were at the table they needed for us didn't leave!  They kept chatting over wine and dessert. If you're gonna do that over dinner, maybe not come to a quaint little place that runs like clockwork and needs to turn over the tables quickly.  But I digress.  As our wait dragged on, all the staff at Legends was super nice and incredibly apologetic, asking if we needed anything and providing us updates far more often than i'd expect.  They even gave us their Bruschetta flatbread special \"on the house\" because they were so sorry about our wait being as long as it got.  And that's a good intro to the food, because HOLY CRAP was that bruschetta flatbread amazing. Warm, soft focaccia drizzled with a very tasty balsamic over fresh cherry tomatoes with feta and super tasty italian sausage.  It was a flavor party I wish i could relive!  When we finally got our table (I may have shot a look at the patrons who had been pre-occupying it when they left as they clearly had had too much wine and had lost track of time (they'd stayed 20 minutes past being asked to leave since Legends needed the table)) we immediately ordered, having had ample time to peruse the menu.   We were then brought our fresh toasted focaccia bread. This is where my first nitpick comes in. We were seated at the \"bar\" while waiting and I noticed one of the line cooks cut the bread, before putting it in the oven to toast, without gloves on! Umm, what?! Was he assuming the heat would burn off any germs on his hands that got on the bread? It was off-putting.  I got the Fettucine Alfredo (with chicken), my partner got the Spinach Ravioli and my mom got the Penne Vodka.  You get a small cup of soup or salad with your main course.  I got the soup (Italian Wedding) and the ladies got salads.  The salads were nice and my soup, while tasting like it'd be put on \"keep warm\" in the kitchen, was still very tasty and fresh like it'd be made earlier today.   Our pastas were good, the tomato sauce on the spinach ravioli and the Penne Vodka is excellent.  My fettucine was great too, but honestly, it was missing that final touch to seal it as \"yup, i'd 100% get that again\", which I honestly think just comes from there not being any pepper.  Maybe put some in the sauce or have it at each table just in case?  All that aside though, everyone at Legends was great and we all really enjoyed our meal.",

On my second visit, just a few days ago, that opinion changed.   My boyfriend, a Legends first timer, arrived late on a Thursday night. He decided on the chicken parmigiana and I ordered the penne vodka, both starting with the wedding soup. The wedding soup tasted good, but it was mostly broth and very minimal substance. The bread came out of the oven as we finished our soup, and it seems like it came from the frozen section at Costco. Our entrees were out shortly after, both were underwhelming. My boyfriend commented that everything tasted like it came from a can, which I had to agree with.   We were in and out of Legends pretty quickly. The food may have been better had we not arrived as late as we did, but I probably won't be taking another chance to test it out. There are much better Italian spots in and around the city that I can count on.",

For this reason I'm torn between a three star or a four star review. This is definitely one of those situations where I wish half star ratings were available.  The Margherita bruschetta is good, I like the pecorino flavoring with the mozzarella.  I've had the gnocchi and I'm not a fan. I'm so picky and snobby when it comes to good gnocchi and that's because I'm used to the best from my Nana's kitchen.  I will say that the spaghetti and meatballs are good. Basic but good. However I've gone and the noodles have been overcooked (where's that half star?)   Chicken parm is pretty spot on, you know except the one time the chicken was super tough and hard to chew.  They serve La Prima so yay.  Sigh, so I've had a couple of bad experiences and I will stick with a three star rating, for now.  At some point I may give it another shot but honestly I've probably made ten visits and there are SO MANY other places in the 'burgh to eat. I think I'd rather go elsewhere, for now.",

I called to see how long the food would take and I was assured that one meal wouldn't take too long.  I ordered Gnocchi w/ one meatball, veggies with garlic and a slice of apple pie.  That came with Soup or salad and I chose homemade Minestrone soup.  Every part of my order was exceptional, perfectly fluffy gnocchi, flavorful vegetables (lovely light garlic taste), hearty  savory minestrone soup, and one of the best apple pie slices I have had in my entire life !!!!!!!!!!!",

Coconut cream pie for dessert was just ok. Wish I would have ordered one of the cakes because they looked better.",

My boyfriend and I don't usually get dessert when out, but everyone around us literally ordered it, so we got it too. And I have to say, I'm thanking the gods for this meal because I've never walked out of restaurant thinking to myself (before this meal) \"wow that was a 10/10\". Tonight, my mind was made up... this is for sure a 10/10.",

Once we got there we where brought right over to a table and seated. They brought over some hot bread with olive oil which was delicious and took drink orders The staff where super friendly and really very nice and helpful. I had the chicken part with spaghetti. The service here is fantastic. The chicken part was good and among the better that I have had not the best but definitely good. I would highly recommend Legends Eatery and I will definitely be going there again.",

It was almost impossible for the three of us to hear each other over the loud, (and at one table obnoxiously shrieking) diners. Luckily two nearby tables left within a half hour. Food arrived and it was very good. But then I realize the restaurant only allows diners 90 minutes at a table -- apparently it says that on the menu, which I hadn't noticed. Plates were rushed to us: not done with our appetizers we got salad; not done with that we got the entrees; and by the end we decided to go elsewhere for dessert where we could slow things down and have the conversation we wanted to have over dinner. I'd go back but if it turns out the same that would be our final time.",

The menu is not extensive, but is supplemented by daily specials. They make most of their own pasta here (maybe all of it, I'm not sure), and that pasta is chewy and excellent!  Portions are not huge, and the prices are a bit high, but the dishes I've tried here have been delicious. They also make a nice house salad, and I can recommend their fried cheese and tomato gravy as a great starter.   Service is very nice, friendly, patient, and knowledgeable. If you like a home-cooking style of Italian food, I recommend Legends without hesitation.",

It is worth it for BYOB.  We have always finish in about 90 minutes, though we did not get desert this visit.  You can request longer when you make your reservations.    We came with a group of 12 to celebrate.  Had a good time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  A few had never been before and stated they would come back.   We split some greens and beans.

The eggplant was good, but honestly, the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich. It would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead.

So one of friends and fellow yelper lives in the hood so we decided to bundle-up, wine-up on a snowy friday night and head for Legends. The interior was more retro than I was expecting, not extremely cozy.  The menu is pretty standard with some rotating specials.  I decided on the chicken cacciatore.  Big portion. No pasta. Potato and veggies. I was stuffed!!  Besides BYOBs, I also have a weakness for restaurants that are walkable. Check.  PROS: BYOB, Friendly servers, open kitchen, large menu for a small place, WALKABLE.   CONS: Lame Corkage fees, could use an interior face lift.

That being said the friends I was with also didn't seem overly impressed by the food, so I think I'm being generous and the rating should be more like 2.5.  I ordered the spinach ravioli and they were just ok.  There was way too much sauce and I guess I anticipated it to taste a bit more basily or something - it did say basil cream sauce, but what I got just seemed like a whole lotta tomato vodka sauce.  The spinach and ricotta didn't have much flavor, but perhaps that was due to my diminished lack of taste these few days with being sick.  All I could taste was the tomato sauce and that to me does not make a great or particularly good meal.    Oh and to top it off the $4/person corkage fee is outrageous.",

The staff is always super friendly, even when you stroll in late in the evening a glass or two of wine into your night.   The food is all house made and truly delicious! The Virginia spots are one of my personal favorites. Honesty anything you try you'll be sure to love.  It is BYOB but beware of the corkage fee per person.",

    "text": "First time here. My parents raved about this place and how great the spots are.   We arrived at 6:45 in a sat night and were promptly seated at our table.  We ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began. They brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks. But this was quickly corrected.   They were fair. We had the Brussel sprouts which were under cooked and did not have any Parmesan cheese on them. Plus they were mixed in with large random pieces of lettuce. So odd!   I was actually looking forward to the special. Ribeye topped with shrimp. But unfortunately they had already sold out of the special. Amazing since it was so early on in the night and nothing else in the menu looked good. It was all traditional oily foods.   Plus who can't make a veal or chick parm. It's the easiest thing to make.   My parents had the spots and the portion was sooooo small and came on an plate all by itself. I give them a 1 for presentation.   The best part of the meal was the wine. Oh yeah it was byob. So I guess I did a good job at picking out the wine. Haha.   Service was nice and friendly. And she did apologize multiple times about the food. But did nothing to make up for it.   Won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.  For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entree that I had a treat.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.",

    "text": "It looks like a diner, it is priced like a decent restaurant and it tastes great. The idea here is simple you are paying for quality of the ingredients, not the table cloths or snooty waiters.  Our meal started with the fried motzerrla  7.95. It came as 5 huge hunks of cheese, with a great marana sauce. This was made in house, not frozen sticks from a box, they come as large triangles.   Meals include a some great rosemary bread, olive oil and soup or salad. For my main I had the spinach ravioli in a pink sauce $15. This was a generous portion of homemade ravioli with enough spinach to taste and rich ricotta cheese. The sauce was luxurious and packed with savory goodness.  Service was fun and family like, the meal ended with a complimentary piece of homemade fudge.  Maybe this is not good for a 1st date but its good for a great meal or  a casual 4th date for when the food matters more than the looks.",

    "text": "OK, so based off the recommendation of my date, I thought  that I would like Legends North Shore but I left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic (salt) that I had consumed.  This restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:  Beans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.  Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.  The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.  Would I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.",

We had reservations which are needed given the size of the place.  Maybe a capacity of 35 or 40.   We got seated right away.  I ordered the beans and greens and the Bird ordered the mussels for appetizers.  Although I tend to like beans and greens with sausage, they did not have sausage however they were really tasty.   The mussels were a nice portion and also very good.  The Bird ordered the Gnocchi with the meat sauce.  Again, it was a nice portion and they were very good!  I ordered the tortellini special which also turned out to include the ravioli.  (A nice surprise ).  The dinner salads were also above average in that they included Gorgonzola , Greek olives, and cucumber.  I wasn't that crazy about the Italian dressing but it was still ok.  Price wise our meal was around $80 which included $4 corking fee.  However we saw on the menu if you present your theater tix you get a 10% discount!  (Another nice surprise )  Parking was easy.  On street a block away.  All in all, a cool place with great food and great service.  We'll be back.",

The location = little scary, especially if you would go at night.  The atmosphere = not top notch.  The food = excellent.     I was very pleasantly surprised with my entire meal.  The bread with the rosemary dipping oil was quite good.  The salad was also very tasty.  It had blue cheese and roasted red peppers which I can't get enough of and no iceberg lettuce in sight.  I opted for the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a basil tomato cream sauce.  It was very good.   Not the best I've ever had but solid.  Lots of sauce to dip more of the tasty bread in.   Did I let it end there?  Of course, not.  I had a giant slice of apple pie with ice cream.  The apples were sliced a little too thickly for my liking but it was a darn good slice of apple pie and that's coming from someone who makes an out of this world homemade apple pie.  Needless to say, I didn't get much work done that afternoon because I could barely move.",
