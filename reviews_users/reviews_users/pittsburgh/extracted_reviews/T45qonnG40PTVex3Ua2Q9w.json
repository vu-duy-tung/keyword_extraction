    "text": "My wife and I ate here with a friend. The service was prompt, the waitress friendly.   We had a pretzel appetizer, I ate the roast duck, my wife and her friend shared the Bianca pizza. The duck leg I had was very dark in color, but had a very good flavor. The cabbage and mashed potatoes that came with it were both tasty, and the lingonberries added a touch of sweetness. The pizza was large, easily enough for two to share, and had a pleasant combination of flavors.   It wasn't crowded, but it being Super Bowl Sunday might have had something to do with that.  The only hiccup was that they were out of Pepsi from the drink fountain, but they had bottles on hand as a backup. Since the pizza was being shared, they brought extra Parmesan cheese and hot pepper flakes.   The prices were average to high, so this won't become an every week place for us, but I expect we will return.",

Went for lunch and maybe because I am not a fan of fast food, I really don't like ordering at the cash register first then sitting. I like sitting down and being waited on especially if I am paying a premium. We did have multiple servers ask us if we needed anything but by the time someone returned with my dressing, I had finished my salad.   I had the Ruben and it was really a disappointment. Very fatty, so much so that I removed the meat and ate the sandwich plain.  I probably will give them another chance because the location is great and their outdoor setting is really nice.",

The food ( Sausage & Kale Pizza, Salmon Pastrami Salad and Concord flavor sorbet + Blady Marry and the flight of 4 beers) was VERY GOOD. In case of Pizza, cocktail and sorbet even outstanding. The dough of the pizza is quite unique (at least we haven't met this kind of dough in any other places). The ambiance was modern, clean and appealing to the eye. The service was very nice, but the guy was in the end of his first week of training so some mistakes were made, but it was very minor and didn't spoil our mood at all. And the value was just great for the experience recieved. Wish we would have such a place in Baltimore, MD were we live, but will visit here every time we are in town. Thank you for a great brunch to the team of The Porch.",

We were mildly excited when we were seated immediately at 6:45 on a Friday night, but then we didn't even see our server for at least 15 minutes after having been seated.  Water was given to us a few minutes in by a food runner or busser.  Once Whitney finally arrived, we knew what we wanted, but wanted to hear the soups.  Upon hearing the choices of either a vegan chili or butternut squash, we requested a few minutes to look for a different app while we waited for our drinks.  I ordered a glass of Pinot noir, and my bf ordered an iced tea.  Minutes passed, and a random girl brought his iced tea.  After waiting another five minutes to get my wine, I just said we should leave.  I'd had a glass of tap water in 25 minutes of being there.  And considering we were seated immediately, I should have been able to get a glass of wine.  One.  Glass.  I will give them another chance in the future because I know that they've been open for about 10 days right now, but it won't be for a while.  We had such a great experience at the Schenley location that this one is  basically a polar opposite.",

The calamari appetizer was mostly breading and overly salted. The chicken dish was way overpriced for the amount of chicken I got. I get the \"quality over quantity\" concept, but for the price I paid I would have liked to have at least a half size chicken instead of about 3-4 oz of over salted chicken. I finished the entire plate but still left hungry. I guess I ordered the wrong thing, but roasted chicken is usually hard to mess up. The potatoes and green beans that came with my meal were good though. My kids' got HUGE pizzas for their meals, which they enjoyed. I tried their beef ribs special and those were spectacular. The macaroni it came with was a little too fussy though. Too many things in it (vegetables and flowers don't belong in mac and cheese). I like simple mac and cheese. I'd try it again but I won't be ordering the roasted chicken or calamari.",

Iced coffee wasn't on the menu, but they made me a glass, no problem. That was very nice. I ordered the eggs benedict with a side of bacon. OMG it was some of the best I've had in town. Loved it!! My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich and she enjoyed her meal as well. That was my second option I was thinking of ordering and it appeared to be delicious. The portion sizes are nice too, where you will definitely be leaving full! The staff was very friendly as well.

    "text": "Why do chef Kevin Hermann and The Porch (both at Schenley and Siena) not get more press and play in Pittsburgh? I ask myself this every year as I thumb through the same old tired bunch that make Pittsburgh Magazine's best restaurant list. (More like best advertisers.) I wonder, too, every time I pay too much money for too little creativity as I peruse yet another copycat menu while seated in an overpriced East End restaurant with no parking.  The answer is I am not sure, but I think it might have something to do with Eat-N-Park or, more accurately, Parkhurst, and the persistent and pernicious elitism that exists within foodie circles regarding corporate restaurants.  As a devotee of all thinks porcine, and, hence, delicious, I hereby give my testimony, with the zeal that only a Southern girl can have with regard to pork, that the BBQ cornbread slider currently on the menu at The Porch is a holy experience. Or perhaps I should say \"wholly\", as in wholly delicious in both preparation and presentation.   Absolutely melt-in-your-grateful-mouth pork shoulder is smothered in a   from scratch barbecue sauce and served open face over a cornbread so moist it just barely qualifies as bread and could really squeak by as a corn pudding. A gorgeous cap of carrot slaw adds a dash of color and tang that perfectly offsets the sweetness of the barbecue sauce. Paired with the watermelon-strawberry-mint gazpacho, it makes for a delightful summer supper, as I had it, or a wonderful appetizer to be shared by all.  I will sum up here and go on the record testifying that this barbecue slider is not your average barbecue slider, and Kevin Hermann is not your average chef. When it comes to originality, he is most certainly leading the pack of local chefs and knocking it out of the Park--literally and figuratively.   Pittsburgh Magazine take note.",

    "text": "A great new addition to Upper St. Clair. My friends and I came for brunch here on Saturday. The restaurant is pretty big with the outdoor patio being a nice option during the summer. We started off with some donuts. They are fresh, warm, and a great way to start brunch. My one friend did say that her donuts were a little overcooked. I had the special omelet of the day, which had salmon in it. My friends had the quiche and breakfast sandwich. All our portions were quite large and filling. My omelet was very good. The english muffin was a bit chewy and thick, so I only had half of it. The field greens were very peppery. Overall, the meal was not outstanding, but a nice change for breakfast in the area.",

The menu itself is an exercise in self-control because everything sounds so delicious- and it is! The steak and fig pizza had us wiping our chins for drool and the artichoke dip appetizer was simply icing on the cake. The staff is very welcoming, quick with recommendations, and very very good at what they do. Highly recommend this place for good food and an even better dining experience.",

It's a Saturday night and quite frankly it's not that busy, therefore that should be sign number 1.   After being seated, my group of four and I waited about 15 minutes before getting water.. not talking about drinks but WATER. Not to mention it was LUKEWARM. The food was decent although I would not recommend the spinach ravioli. Uncooked noodles stuffed with spinach and topped with sloppy joe meat.. not worth $21. The service could be much better and the food menu is rather pricey. From them running out of certain apps to them not being able to split the receipt correctly, I had a rough experience at The Porch.",

    "text": "Twice now I've been to The Porch at Siena in the new development behind the Whole Foods Marketplace on Washington Road in the South Hills.   I'll start off by saying that for what it is, I like it. I like the selection of ever changing craft beers which they have on tap, and they have some good ones. Example being The Porch has Lost Abbey on draft. This is something I've never personally seen on a draft list, so I was pretty pumped. Definitely had to have one.   The Porch...Probably my favorite part of the facility is the outside dining area in which you can see their small garden where they grow herbs, tomatoes and other crops which are used in their finished product. I like when a restaurant does this. They had a pretty nice crop going too by the looks of it.   The Porch seems to be pretty heavy into their wood fired oven which I really like. They seem to have some generally solid offerings such as their pizzas. The margherita pizza which I had ate on our first visit had a nice flavor however it seemed to require a bit more sauce. I did enjoy how they gave you a small sampling of different herbs, parmesan cheese and dry chili flake. I liked this much more than offering a shaker full of each. Pizza is good for a wood fired pizza, however there are better. I think some improvement could be made here and I'm sure in time it will improve.   On our second time at The Porch we shared the Farm Bread. With the oven toasted bread you get apple butter, a jam(which was exceptional, and in fact made me start liking jam) and a honey butter. All were nice. Three large pieces of bread are served. Some pieces seemed to get a little black. Could have done a better job there.  My better half had the potato soup which she said she liked. However I tasted it and the bacon in it to me was a bit smokey, I would say more than normal. I don't generally care for potato soup so it was a bit lost on me anyhow.   For her entree she went for the caesar salad which was a nice sized salad. I'm not a fan of caesar dressing so I can't say how it tasted, but it certainly looked appetizing.  I had the Hanger Steak with smoked potatoes, broccolini and a saffron zabaione. The steak was salted perfectly, the steak was cooked to a medium rare which was perfect. As for the potatoes the smokey lingering after taste was a bit heavy and it didn't really do it for me. It over powered the fingerling potatoes. They also seemed a bit under cooked. The broccolini was quite good and had a nice crisp texture to it, but not much flavor over all. The zabaione lost on me so I can't comment much on it. It was a good plate though for $23.00  Service was good, however our server seemed a bit nervous. I couldn't tell if she was new, but she did a good job, was pleasant and that's what counts. We will return.",

After waiting for a long time they brought me an extremely dry salad with browned arugula leaves and rotting strawberries WITHOUT chicken. My husband had to flag down a different server to let them know it was missing chicken. Our server came back several minutes later to apologize and said it would only take two minutes because their chicken was already heated up. $17 for a salad and you want to just throw some heated up chicken on it. No thanks. It's sad really because the restaurant is so nice inside and the location is perfect. The food and service is just lacking.",

On weekdays, during the day, you have to place your food/drinks orders at the counter and it'll be brought to you. You even have to take your water/utensils to your table yourself which I found a bit strange. (Shoutout for their fruit infused water!). Their menu has a limited selection for vegetarians and I went for the veggie burger while my friend ordered the margherita pizza. It came out in a jiffy! But our drinks did take significantly longer, although they were delicious which kind of made up for that. The strawberry-basil margarita is actually made from fresh ingredients and not syrup - yum! The orange blossom was really good too. The food tasted good.. except for the side salad which was soggy and over-dressed. The staff every now and then would pop by to politely ask if we needed anything but would direct us back to the billing counter to help ourselves when we requested for something. I found this system is a bit wierd.. somewhere in the middle of self serve and table service. Besides that, I enjoyed the experience and would love to go back if they expand their selection for vegetarians!",

    "text": "This place opened in June of 2017 and we've been there a couple of times since. In a way, it's a frustrating place as it has flashes of brilliance accompanied by big misses.  Occupying a brand new development in Upper St. Clair, the actual location overlooks the new Whole Foods and is part of the retail development above the supermarket. There is ample parking in front and when you enter the place, you are immediately greeted at the host station. To your left is the bar with the ubiquitous television screens and beyond that is a covered porch that can serve for outdoor dining during the warmer months. During cooler months, it's covered over and enclosed. To your right is the main dining room with multiple tables and sections. The back walls has a design of many bees and sticks of wood. Not sure what the connection is but it is a bit whimsical.  On both visits, we were seated right away as the place was never totally full. It was pretty busy, but not exceedingly so. On both visits, we had to wait a long time for a waitress to show up with the menus. Not sure why the hostess did not provide menus? The menu does change as it was different between our two visits. We asked how often and no one seemed to know, although one of the waitresses told us she was there since it opened and the menu had changed twice.  On this second visit, we tried the Pumpkin Gnudi, the Ratatouille Pizza, and the fish special which was a portion of a Skate.  When I've made gnudi, or had it elsewhere, it was always a rather large ball of dough with the requisite flavorings. Here, it was a compact mass of a savory pumpkin mash that was deep fried. Odd, but not unpleasant. The five Gnudis were served on top of a sauce that was the traditional sweet pumpkin sauce with spice notes as well as cranberry chunks and roasted hazelnut bits. On top of it all was one deep-fried Kale leaf. That last was totally unnecessary to the dish. The best way to eat this was to make sure that all the different elements were on your spoon at the same time and then it was very tasty.   The Skate came with roasted Cauliflower, forbidden rice, and a green herb oil Each part of the dish was very tasty although we asked that the fist be cooked until it was flaky, and the kitchen sent it out with the fish still very underdone. Not to the point that we had to send it back, but enough to detract from our enjoyment of it. The fish, rice, and cauliflower were excellent!  The last dish we tried was the Ratatouiile Pizza. This was supposed to be  a pizza with eggplant, zucchini and the like on it. What I saw was mostly tomato sauce with ricotta cheese melted on top. There were a few crumbs of Eggplant here and there, and maybe two tiny chunks of zucchini. The overwhelming flavor was of tomato. At least the thin crust was not greasy this time (On our previous visit, the pizza we had then was so greasy, it melted the paper it was served on!).  We also ordered one glass of wine. We got a regular glass with about 4 Oz of wine in it and were charged $12 for it which is a ripoff. The whole meal cost in the vicinity of $35 per person which is on the high end.   Another factor is that the menu is relatively slight. There is not too much variety there. So, if you are picky, you are likely to not find too many things to  your liking. While I like the location, concept, and find some of the dishes executed very well, it will probably be a long time until we go there again due to the negative aspects of the place.",

I've had a couple of their fancy sandwiches - the buffalo chicken was a standout, really great - crispy fried chicken with buffalo sauce that wasn't insanely hot but added the right flavor. The bread it was on was a hit as well.   The service is nice but a little strange. You walk in and order at the counter (fast-casual style), then go find a seat. A server will show up with your drink.   Various people, all friendly, will deliver your food. It works, but it's a nice enough place and has a price-point that should support real servers.   Like other upscale \"fast casual\" spots, it's awkward to decide tip-level when you first order, before having received any service.  They present your unsigned credit-card slip at the end of your meal, but no pen to write in the tip and sign the thing. I like to give a good tip for decent service - just wish they would streamline the process a bit.   But, again, food is quite good - give it a try and post a review. I'll be back.",

Other reviewers seem to be upset with slow service but I think this should be somewhat expected when a new restaurant opens up and the kinks are still being worked out. So, for that reason I think the other reviews may be a little harsh. I personally didn't find service to be slow when we were there. It was a busy Friday night so I was prepared for a wait but our party of 2 was seated in only 15 minutes. Bar, dining room a patio seating. Fireplace outside.  The restaurant was very clean which I expect since it is brand new. Our server was pleasant and helpful. Our appetizer and salad was out in only 5 minutes and the rest of our food only about 10-15 minutes later. I really enjoyed the margherita pizza which was very flavorful and enough for 2 people with 6 slices. Caesar salad wasn't anything special and the potatoes were a little bland for me. However, the potatoes did come with a curry ketchup that my husband loved, it is just personally not something I like. Prices are inexpensive I'd say, approx $34 for the 2 of us including a beer for my husband and not including tip.   While I was not blown away by my experience, I definitely did not have the same negative experience as some of the other reviewers did. I thought it was good and I would come back. Would like to sit on the patio next time if it is not so busy.",

    "text": "Today is opening day at the sister restaurant of the Porch at Schenley. I was told that the two places are identical in their menu offerings.  When I arrived I was greeted warmly and introduced to the manager Michael Damas. I learned that the concept behind this restaurant is to use local home grown ingredients and they are actually starting a garden in the back where they hope to use some of its produce. They also serve farm to table meals.  I learned that until 4 pm which they consider lunch you place your order at the register, they give you a number and then you can carry it to whatever table you wish to sit at. They have two inviting fireplaces both inside and out-The restaurant is very beautiful with a firefly motif to it both inside and out. I learned that this motif was to capture the idea of seeing fireflies on your front porch while relaxing on a summer's evening.  When they change over for dinner it becomes full service. Brunch is served on Sat and Sun. I also understood it is one of the Eat n Park hospitality groups.  For my lunch I decided to have the strawberry salad special with blue cheese. I decided to hold off on dessert not knowing my portion size. I got my food fairly quickly. As they told me the salad had a bit of a \"zing\" to it on the dressing but otherwise it was good. An item of note, if you want bread with your salad then please ask for regular bread because they serve a farm bread for $6.00. Expect to pay for this place. Lunch prices fall within the $11.00-$30.00 range.   I did ask to see the dessert menu and learned that among their offerings they serve Millie's ice cream for $5.00 as one of the items. Currently they are only carrying two flavors-rhubarb and chocolate but they expect to get more once the business gets established.  If you want dessert and didn't prepay for it then you would have to go to the counter again to order it and pay there. I had the chocolate ice cream which for Millie's is always 5 stars in quality.  The staff is more than willing to attend to your needs. I found them exceedingly friendly and helpful.  Getting here can be part of the problem since Siena Drive is a half intersection. I had a similar problem when Whole Foods opened here. My advice is to enter and exit off Washington Road across from South Hills Village. If you choose to go Siena Drive then you must enter it headed towards Washington Rd and if you exit that way you can only go to the right.  Another thing is there is much construction in this area since they are building some sort of mall complex and it is easy to find yourself in the middle on construction (as I did when I tried to find it) but once I had it down I could park easily.  In addition to salads they serve sandwiches with your choice of mixed greens or taters, pizza, a kids menu, and of course they have a full bar. The bar has a wine list along with beer and mixed cocktails. They also are BOYB but they have a $15.00 corkage fee.  The executive chef is Keven Hermann. This place seems nice but can get pretty pricey if you are bringing a family. Will give it another go round once things settle down with this construction nightmare surrounding it.",

    "text": "We just finished having brunch at The Porch. We are extremely disappointed. Everything on the menu sounded absolutely delicious and was beautiful. Unfortunately, the taste didn't live up to the expectations. We ordered the cinnamon rolls which were so hard that you could literally bang it off the plate. The edges of the biscuit were soft and warm and buttery, but when you got 1 bite in, it was ice cold. I assume that they premade them, refrigerate them and then reheat as ordered. My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and he said it was okay, but really greasy. I had a salad which was okay, not the worst salad, but far from the best.   The other thing that was frustrating was the service. The waitress was extremely friendly, but very absent. We waited over 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted. All of our food came out, but we waited several minutes before our waitress came over to check on us. My boyfriend was done with his meal before I was able to ask for dressing. It took even longer to get our check. The slow pace was very frustrating. The restaurant itself wasn't even half full. I'm not sure what other tables she was responsible for. It might not have been her fault, but management should have stepped in to notice that her tables were being neglected.   It's a beautiful restaurant, but not somewhere we would choose to return to.",

Just weird.  The wait staff was available for some things just not all.  I mean if I'm paying full restaurant prices I think I should have a waiter or waitress.",

    "text": "The Porch at Siena has one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh. It's a fact. From fantastic bloody marys to their interesting chorizo eggs benedict to their perfectly balanced breakfast sandwich, they offer a full, and compelling brunch menu.   Despite reading other reviews regarding poor service, I have never had a bad waiter or bartender. And my food and beverages have always been brought out swiftly.  I have tried a variety of items off of their brunch menu and have found them all delicious. The chorizo eggs benedict is one of my favorites. My eggs were cooked perfectly and had a nice runny yolk and the chorizo adds a new complex flavor profile to a tried and True brunch staple.   That being said the best item on the brunch menu is, without a doubt, their breakfast sandwich. It sounds simple, just eggs, bacon and cheese on some sourdough bread, but it packs a serious punch. The bread is absolutely delicious, it has a warm, buttery crunch on the outside while the still being soft enough for a sandwich. The bacon is thick cut and adds a nice saltiness and smokiness to the sandwich. Finally, the cheese they use is perfect for this sandwich the cheddar ties the whole sandwich together. Order this sandwich, I promise you will not be disappointed.  In regard to their sides I have tried and loved their biscuits. I rarely have enough room to eat them with an entree however each time I have been able to order them they have been fluffy and delicious. It comes with homemade apple butter and jellies. All their breakfast items come with a side of their potatoes which are another highlight. They are crispy on the edges but soft and fluffy in the middle. An in house curry ketchup is served with the potatoes and I wish I could bottle it up and take it home. It offers and small but flavorful kick to the ketchup that puts it a cut above other ketchups, even homemade.  I'm also a big fan of their original bloody mary. It has a nice strong horseradish bite while still remaining refreshing and smooth on the finish. I order it for every brunch there. They also offer seasonal bloody marys, however I have never found them to be as good as the original. Despite being a cilantro lover, their cilantro and habanero bloody mary is too strong on the cilantro and just didn't provide the same fantastic flavor of the original.  Overall, I really have no bad things to say about the Porch, at least for Brunch. I have not tried the restaurant at other times, so I can't speak to their normal lunch or dinner service, but if it's anything like their brunch it will be fantastic.  TLDR: Good service, delicious brunch, order the breakfast sandwich and a pitcher of bloody mary, 5/5",

The calamari appetizer was tasty and my roast beef sandwich was good and filling. This was probably the best experience I've had here, but it still just isn't worth it to me. The food and service are just mediocre for the price. It's also just so...boring. Minimalist aesthetic in a half full (or empty, depending on your world view) strip mall in the suburbs. There's also one of those small luxury housing developments next to it where all the houses look exactly the same. In summary, this place sells slightly overpriced mediocre food in an uninspired location.",

There was a \" mix up\" with how they cook a \"medium\" done burger. They fixed it and then the manager took it off the bill and talked to us. That was very nice, my mom can be tough to please but it was pretty much raw. Thats her favorite burger as she claims. The waiter was very friendly but kind of inexperienced, they weren't super busy and the service was just a little slow. I was a little disappointed with pizza, it wasn't terrible but maybe im just used to a different style of the pizza. Would definitely go back.",

The pizza is wonderful. A tasty thin crust but with lots of extra dough around the edge if you want more to crunch on.   We also like the pasta Bolognese big time. And the salmon.   Another part that works for us is that this is an upscale restaurant that welcomes children. We like to sit at a table near the grassy area so the kids can play there but we can keep an eye on them.",

    "text": "The menu is small, but very interesting. My dad said that the mushrooms on his pizza actually were different than the standard mushrooms you'd get in a store and I had asparagus on my pizza for the first time. The portion sizes are large. The mixed drink I got was great. There are some strange things... They definitely wasted a lot of pepper flakes and some oregano by putting piles of those and cheese on the plate instead of allowing us to choose if we wanted it. They also didn't give us a spoon, so we were scooping the cheese and oregano (and a few pepper flakes for him) on our forks, which isn't the best way to get something off a tray onto anything.  The service was great and friendly, but when we had leftover pizza, she gave us weird containers where we had to stack the three leftover slices on top of each other. Dad had gotten a half pizza box when he had been there before. I asked about them and they weren't out of them. She'd just chosen to give us boxes that required us to stack our food on top of itself. I suggested that she might want to go with pizza boxes for pizza in the future. She offered to get me one, but I'd already stacked my pizza and I didn't want to waste the container I'd been given.  Their water glasses are super small, but at least they leave the bottle of water on the table, too. Their restroom was clean. However, you're required to touch the handle on the way out and they only have the air dryers/germ tossing around machines. Better than the Dyson enclosed germ machines, but still risky. So, I had to wipe my hands off on my clothes AND maneuver my sweater so I could use it to open the door. If you're going to leave me without an option to dry my hands safely, you should at least let me get out of the restroom without having to TOUCH the door. I can't imagine how I'd have gotten out in short sleeves. It was hard enough in the sweater I was wearing.  Oh! Dad had been there for lunch before. For lunch it's more of a counter service place where you order your food and drinks and they give you a number to put on your table, then deliver the food. For dinner, they have full wait staff service.",

We started off with a mimosa and wow, they were delicious! Definitely freshly squeezed OJ, how refreshing!  We chose here for brunch because the brunch menu had a lot of options. Whether you'd prefer breakfast, pizza, or a sandwich you had many choices. I went with the Turkey sandwich and potatoes. The sandwich had fresh cut turkey, arugula, a garlic aioli and came together so nicely. The potatoes were also seasoned and cooked to perfection.  All together we were all very satisfied with our meals! It is a little pricey for brunch, my bill was $35 for just me but as I stated they use fresh ingredients so you get what you paid for. No gross frozen food here! I'm excited to return for dinner in the future.",

I've also tried my husbands roast beef sandwich and my mother in law had a jumbo lump crab cake omelet, and don't forget those crispy potatoes with the curry ketchup! Everything here has been delicious. Also, totally not someone that usually orders \"speciality drinks\" while I'm out, but I've had the Moscow mule and the porch lemonade. Both were sooo refreshing and delicious. The atmosphere is so relaxing, and the outdoor area is perfect. The ingredients are super fresh (literally they have a huge garden) and there's even an outdoor grassy area if you're like me and have a non-stop 2 year old who can't sit still. And all at a super affordable price. Highly highly recommend!",

We were seated immediately and given a small brunch menu & water and told our server would be over shortly. After about 5 minutes, he came over and introduced himself. He asked if we wanted anything else besides water and then asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the margherita pizza & my mom ordered the grilled chicken farm salad.   The food came out in about 15 minutes, but my pizza looked kinda sad. It didn't look like a normal margherita pizza.  And it smelled like it was from Chuck E Cheese. I do like that they placed toppings on the side so that I could too accordingly. After eating the first slice, I came to the conclusion that this was just a normal cheese pizza. Kind of disappointing. There was nothing special to bring me back here. However, my mom said her salad was one of the best she's ever had and the chicken was top quality.  The service was good but my food wasn't great. The place was clean and I love that they grow all of their veggies fresh in the garden. If I return here I'll definitely not order the margherita pizza.",

I love going here for brunch - their prices are very reasonable and come hungry because they give you huge portions! The space is very airy and bright, although there were a couple of flies hanging around just because the porch section is open, but it's not a deal breaker.  We arrived a little after 10:30am and the porch area was a little packed, but inside seating was pretty empty. They don't sit everyone on top of each other when it's unnecessary too which I appreciated lol. Our waitress was extremely friendly and patient.  We wanted to try a handful of brunch food since I was thinking about having my bridal shower here. However, what really aggravated me was when she went to get the manager to speak to us about private events, he wouldn't come out because he was too busy and to call back tomorrow or another time. In my opinion, this didn't leave a very good impression and we only needed a couple minutes of his time. Again, they weren't very busy at the time so I don't see why he wouldn't want to speak to someone interested in a private event, which made my decision a little easier.  On another note, the food is extremely fresh and hot and tastes like it came out of your mother's kitchen! I will definitely be returning, just not having any private events there.",

The food is pretty great, pizza being my favorite menu item. They have several options and each one I've tried they've done very well. The staff is all very friendly and helpful and the manager seems to be engaged with everything and making sure all the customers are well taken care of!   My favorite thing about this place is the happy hour specials. You can go in and get a bite to eat and have a few drinks without it costing too much. Have a seat at the bar, watch whatever game happens to be on at the time and relax! What more could you ask for?",

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was very tasty.  We went with a pizza to share for the two of us and it was the perfect amount of food.  Wait staff was great and we were very pleased overall.  If we're ever in the area again we'll definitely be back.",

He made good on his word and gave me a new fish sandwich, and salad, with dressings on the side, and no unripe tomatoes.  The sandwich and salad were much improved without all the tartar sauce, and salad dressing, and it was way better for me to add it on myself lightly, the way I like it.  So I thank the management for making my previous mediocre experience right today ... Cheers!",

As a full disclaimer, I would give this experience 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed it!   The atmosphere here is awesome. Very bright and open, offering a lot of natural light. We were seated right away for brunch. Our waitress seemed unsure when she approached our table, reading specials and different options verbatim from a notepad.   We decided to order cocktails and my friend ordered a Bloody Mary and I ordered the Porch Pink Lemonade. When the drinks came, I tried mine and thought to myself \"this barely tastes like alcohol.\" I assumed because I had chosen a sweeter drink that was why. When I got my check I found out she had literally just served me a pink lemonade! I was annoyed as I ordered the drink with the exact name from the menu.   To eat, I had the breakfast burrito. I really enjoyed the inside, but wasn't crazy about the sauce on the outside. I enjoyed their potatoes as well, but don't love their unique ketchup (what can I say, Heinz or bust!)   Overall, I know I enjoy the Porch. My first experience at this location just left me wanting a little more!",

I have visited the Porch at Schenley in Oakland many times and enjoy it, so I had similar expectations for the location in Upper St. Clair.   I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant--much more space than the Oakland location--and it was bright and airy. I was nervous about getting a table for brunch without waiting, but we were sat right away and our server was there in an instant.   I ordered a Bloody Mary, which was fine, but it was a bit vinegary. I ordered the Eggs Benedict for my meal. It had all the classics--perfectly poached eggs, a toasted english muffin, ham, and hollandaise, but it also included shrimp. I enjoyed the addition because the natural sweetness of the shrimp helped to cut through the fat of the hollandaise. The flavors were great, but despite the speedy delivery of my meal, it was a bit cold when it arrived. The dish was paired with the Porch's signature crispy potatoes. I love their potatoes and their signature ketchup. Something about the unique flavor takes everything to the next level.   I enjoyed my brunch at the Porch, but nothing was fantastic.",

The restaurant is pretty casual, with plenty of parking and seating. We were seated immediately, but service was a little bit slower. We didn't mind, since we weren't in a rush, but she definitely wasn't very attentive to check back in with us.   The Porch is owned by the same company as Eat 'N Park and reminds me of a more upscale version of the diner.

They also offer mussels - different preparations (some hits, some misses) - as an appetizer, but I find that the portion is big enough for dinner. I'm not as much a fan of the dining room, mainly because the lighting is too bright (and you can't take advantage of happy hour specials!). The staff here is young but polite.   In the summer, the side porch is a pleasant alternative. There is a fireplace there in the winter but unless you are hearty, you might find it a little chilly.",

I went on a Monday around 7pm, I'm saying this because the menu changes from lunch to diner, also according to week day and weekend. The Porch provided a very ecstatically pleasing environment. The outside sitting was very comfortable. My waitress was attentive and made sure I had everything I needed.   I must say the food was a let down. I ordered the 10 oz New York Strip Steak, which came with truffled parmesan fries and roasted garlic Aioli. In my opinion the presentation was very lazy. I must say I'd rather prefer a baked potato of some sort instead of the fries. The steak seasoning was to not special and did not wow me. The steak was fairly tender but could've been better. The truffle parmesan sauce that the fries were on top of did not impress me. But I just added every Pittsburgher's secret weapon (ketchup) and called it a day.",

I ordered water and the carafe was very dirty, it looked like someone added a dash of pepper to it.  I asked my server, who was very good by the way, if I could buy a bottle of water and she told me that they didn't sell bottled water.  On my way out of the restaurant I noticed their display cooler full of bottles of drinks including a whole case worth of water.  After inquiring one of the other servers told me that they only sell the bottles during the weekdays.  I asked to talk to a manager and he gave me a free bottle of water to try to shut me up.  When i asked him why she wouldn't sell me the bottle he played dumb like he didn't know, not wanting to have to acknowledge the stupid \"no bottles on the weekend\" policy.  I feel bad for the waitress to have to deal with this situation all because of some arrogant policy that some idiot in upper management came up with.  The manager who tried to play dumb to save face is childish, at least be honest and own up to your lame policies.  All of this could have been avoided if they weren't serving dirty water in the first place.  I understand wanting to do things your own way and not wanting to have tacky looking bottles of soda on your tables during weekends.  You should understand that water is an exception and if you want to be as upscale of an establishment as your policies would suggest than you should offer a legitimate high end water option.",

    "text": "I want to start this review by mentioning that I created a Yelp review on this restaurant and it is no longer listed.  My friend and I attempted to have lunch here last week. I say attempted because we left without eating our food. We both ordered the chopped salad with pulled chicken. First, the 'salad' was not chopped. It was large chunks  of Romaine lettuce with chick peas and some miscellaneous cheese. I believe that it was supposed to be feta.  The dressing was supposed to honey mustard but had an anchovy taste to it.   The meat on the salad was of a mystery variety. It was a grayish looking meat with an off flavor and an even stranger texture.  On our way out we stopped and talked to the manager and told him that we were leaving the salads uneaten and why.  His response was that they pull the whole chicken and white and dark meat are mixed.  The meat on our salads in no way resembled chicken (white, dark, or otherwise). The manager did refund our money however I feel that everyone should be warned to order this salad with caution.  There are plenty of good restaurants in the South Hills, this just isn't one of them.",

The services was terrible....there were way to many people running around, bringing food, removing plates.  We had at least 6 different people visit our table besides our waitress usually I wouldn't complain about this but it was very distracting and caused confusion among the staff. The appetizers took forever and once they did arrive our meals arrived within a minute too. The meals were cold and  not good. My husband had the lamb which he couldn't eat because the chop was 90% fat VERY VERY little meat. My tuna was completely cold and risotto was undercooked.  We then decided to stop in for lunch....hoping that date night was just a rough day for them....lunch was terrible....my burger was so over cooked that it crumbled into tiny pieces as I tried to eat it. They burger came with a fired egg that was undercooked and swimming in egg whites.   My husband had a very overcooked piece of swordfish and found and entire garlic cloves in his eggplant dish.   I had very high hopes after our first meal here...but after two more disappointments we will not be returning.",

It was the terrible service we experienced upon getting our table which was extremely disappointing.  It took 30 minutes for someone to come over and take a drink order.   Another 20 minutes passed before we got our drinks.  Our water was only refilled once.  Once our meals were finished, we waited another 30 minutes to get our check and this was even after the dinner crowd had largely dissipated and the restaurant was not busy at all.  At this point in the evening, there were a bunch of servers, bussers, and even a manager standing around not doing anything at all so I don't understand why we were looked over/ignored.  Our server was nice, but she was obviously over worked or not attentive.  Either way, I don't plan on returning.  The food was only okay, so it is not enough to make up for the terrible service.",

    "text": "The serving staff gets 5 stars but the cooks/bartender get 2 bringing my overall review of Porch to 3. My fam (lots of kids there on Sunday night!) started with the bread and crab/corn fritter appetizers ... the bread was delicious. The crab/corn balls weren't bad but they looked a little sad - 5 tiny balls in a larger app bowl with lots of decoration. My thought, \"womp womp.\" If my husband didn't finish it in one bite, I would have had time to take a picture. Also, I ordered a blackberry gin drink to start but I had to send it back. I kept sipping and sipping and something didn't taste right - so I asked my hubs to try and he said, \"yeah, that's heavy on limes.\" Limes?! Limes! Yes. There were 4 or 5 in my glass which explained why it tasted like lime aid to me (yuck) and not *blackberry* gin - the waitress kindly took it back when I pointed out there was no mention of limes in the drink description and I actually don't like limes. Onto the main food dishes - I got flank steak and my hubs got the burger. He enjoyed the burger but my flank steak - ordered medium/well was more like rare. I didn't send it back after the drink fiasco but this is what made me realize it's the cooking staff that doesn't have enough experience. The food concepts on the menu are great but delivering on expectations (based off menu and order) is where they fail for me. The sweet potato fries were good but for a $23 steak, I hope it's cooked to order and the sweet potato fries couldn't save that. We finished with bread pudding (eh) and ice cream. Kids were happy. Hubs said, \"It was ok. Not my favorite meal.\" It wasn't mine either and I just think that when you eat out, it's a place you want to go to because the food is THAT good, not because you're too tired to cook. I don't see us returning anytime soon when there are other places to try and nothing  that makes me want to go back (nice decor though!).",

We ordered the antipasto for 14.00 which was the weirdest antipasto I have ever seen. It was some random marinated absolutely gross vegetables thrown on a small wood bread board. No lettuce, olives, dressing. It was truly horrible. The pizza was not much better. If you are expecting Brick oven pizza, go somewhere else. It was cold and had very little on it and the crust was the consistency of a cheap frozen pizza. This little bit of slop was 28.00 and we left hungry.  We asked for the antipasto first but of coarse it came with the pizza, brought out of the kitchen by someone who probably saw it laying around cold. The waitress didn't even bother to ask if it was good.  Never again.",

I asked to add on a side salad, which was only mixed greens with a little olive oil and was charged $4? For a restaurant in the Eat and Park chain I think they are acting a little big for their britches and don't know how to price correctly.  $8 for ONE small mimosa made with bottom shelf sparkling wine is a bit crazy when you consider you can get an entire carafe of mimosas for $8 at other trendy places filled with televisions outside Pittsburgh. We spent an evening at Alla Famiglia last night with top shelf liquor and fine food and the bill was only $40 more than a brunch here in the suburbs at an Eat and Park chain.",

Let me say now that they are still figuring thing out and have only been open one week.  When I registered with the greeter she told me about 20 minutes.  The actual wait was 5.  If they were attempting to under promise and over deliver, they were successful.  The wings I got were good not great.  The prime rib sandwich on sourdough was tasty. The Mrs's got the burger with shredded pork on it.  She loved it.  The mini baked potatoes were excellent.   Our server James was very attentive and obviously paid attention during his 12 days of training.   He made a very nice first impression and used those Ritz Carlton service words like a pro...\"my pleasure\" \"of course\".  The part we sat in was chilly. Next time we will request sitting outside, and there will be a next time.  Update March 2018 This has become one of our favorite places to eat. The staff is excellent (authentic/professional/friendly).  There is evidence that their initial training is being reinforced and modeled by management.  The menus is limited and a little quirky but we love it. You will too if you bring an open mind.  This is NOT Eat' Park.",

First, the tea was not prepared correctly and resulted in a bitter beverage.  Next, when we ordered the quiche the waitress walked away without asking whether we wanted greens or potatoes on the side (you have a choice of either). Then, the waffle was completely dry. We drenched it with syrup and waited, but it was drier than cardboard and difficult to even swallow. The espresso marscapone was on the side and very sparse, so it did little to help. The quiche crust was burnt to make matters worse. When the waitress brought our food out we had to move everything on the table for her to make room. She was quite inattentive and we had to get up and ask a different server for our check.  I won't be returning to this location, and I sure hope they can turn things around.",

Food however was a different story. I ordered the Grilled Romaine salad, soup, and my fiance and I split the cheese tray. (He had the steak). Prior to ordering the salad, I asked the waitress if I could add a protein to make the salad an entree, and she told me that it was an entree salad and it came with shrimp. When I got my salad, there were 3 pieces of shrimp on it, all of which were ice cold in the middle. That would have been fine except for the fact that it was a grilled romaine salad, served warm. So I had warm lettuce, 3 partially frozen shrimps, and homemade croutons that were soggy-  for $13. The soup was average, and the cheese tray was good, but for $15 there wasn't any bread or any thing that came with it. Just cheese and a few olives/almonds.
