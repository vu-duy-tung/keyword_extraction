    "text": "I am so glad this place is in Pittsburgh! If you work downtown, you know that there aren't many lunch options. Sure, you can walk to Market Square and sit down somewhere, but if you're short on time, your options are pretty limited to run-of-the-mill chain-type places. Bluebird is such a breath of fresh air!  From the signage to the decor, it is warm and inviting. And though the interior is on the small side, there's plenty of room to wait inside for when the weather is bad. They change the menu often depending on what is in season, especially the desserts.  I had been meaning to try this place for a long time now because my work friends rave about it, but because I often bring my lunch, I didn't get a chance to go until last week. Because we were having a pizza party at work, I decided to get a few sides and a dessert to the go with the pizza. It was a Friday after all, so I had to go all out. I had the housemade chips and a side of brussels sprouts with pecans and bacon jam. The bacon jam (which is so overdone at times) was really the perfect complement to the brussels sprouts and I had no trouble eating the entire thing.  For dessert, I tried the panna cotta on recommendation from the work friend. It was an earl gray panna cotta on top of a small piece of poppyseed cake. It was absolutely delicious. The textures of the panna cotta and cake blended together perfectly. There were so many sides and bakery items I wanted to try, and of course I need to come back for a real lunch sometime, not just sides and desserts. Everything looked and smelled incredibly fresh, and there are so many healthy choices as well. This is truly food you can feel good about.",

I had the fried egg sandwich on the pretzel bun and the hubster had the fried egg sandwich with bacon on ciabatta roll.  OMG!  For a breakfast sandwich they are HUGE! We ended up splitting the pretzel bun sandwich and saved the ciabatta roll for the flight back to Sacramento (low cost airlines = little bags of peanuts and pretzels).  Bread on both sandwiches was excellent.  Nicely layered with fresh produce and choice of swiss or cheddar cheese - yum!!!  We also got a cashew scone and chocolate chip muffin for later which were also delightful.",

So if you're hungry I suggest the Quiche or another daily special. One friend likes the grits. On a lighter appetite, the croissant or an amazing muffin.   The coffee.....well, I am not happy with the flavor. Too bitter. I enjoy espresso,cappuccino, drip coffees, and usually the strong flavors. I have tried their cappuccino, americano, drip and decaf cappuccino,drip and pour overs. Nothing makes me warm and fuzzy. Granted, I am a coffee snob, so take my judgement with a grain of salt.

It's the best oatmeal I've ever had.   Sandwiches for lunch meeting are really great but I get the feeling that catering either isn't their favorite thing to do or they just don't do it enough to perfect the art.   Almost every time we order, something is missing but overall they take care of the issue and we are still happy customers.   If the food wasn't so amazing I'd never go there because their customer service is lacking.  In my personal experience I've never run into anyone on staff there who didn't think that it was my pleasure to enter into the establishment.

    "text": "I will preface this review by saying that Bluebird's food is more than just a-ok.  The breakfast pastries are deliciously gluttonous. The lunches are fresh and unique. Seriously, try the turkey-gouda sandwich. Yum.   I also appreciate that the Bluebird Kitchen works around seasonal local ingredients.  Blueberry season? Expect to see it in muffins, macaroons, and even the soups! This is fantastic.  My problem has nothing to do with the food quality itself.   For several reasons, I think every item on the menu is overpriced by about a dollar.   First, the portions are small. The sandwiches, though delicious, are about the size of the lunches you would make at home with wonderbread and deli turkey.   Second, sides are not included.  If you do want a side, it will cost you at least 3 dollars. Not worth it for a side!   Last, some of the people who work there are downright unfriendly.  Once, I queried a rather listless female about the blackberry macaroons.  I had purchased Bluebird's scrumptious macaroons before, but the ones I saw behind the glass this time were \"mini.\"  So when crankypants tells me off the top of her head that they were about the same price as the normal sized pastries, I was taken aback.  When I asked her if she was sure about the cost, she rolled her eyes and gave me sass. Come on. It was a just question!   Like I said, I am overall impressed with the superb quality of the food.  But both the service and quantity are lacking...",

At times their kitchen can get easily backed up. I would suggest if you have a limited time for lunch that you may want to skip visiting Bluebird. If you can order ahead or if they offer delivery you may want to consider that route.   If it is winter time when you visit, you may want to be keep your coat on. The frequent opening of the door tends to keep the entire place on the colder side. Opening doors though are a great sign of a business doing well though so this is hardly a criticism of the establishment.",

We walked back to the office to eat and we both agreed that the bread was VERY  TOUGH!!! and we both felt like we needed dental work afterwards.  We agreed that for the price, the bread could have been softer and there should have been more ingredients.

I arrived at 2:50pm and not wanting anyone to have to prepare something that close to closing time I opted from the tuna nicoise salad with the mustard dressing. Now hear me out on this one. When the dressing is the best part of the meal you know you're in trouble.    The description of the salad said, \"Yellow fin tuna cured in oil. Oh come off if BBK, yellow fin, and cured ought to be removed out of that description. I feel smoke going up my breaches and I don't like it.  I do not like far reaching menu descriptions and inflated prices for a tuna salad.  I had to grab a  copy of the menu after I started eating.  I had to reread the meal description to double check what I had gotten myself into.  I don't care what kind of tuna you started out with. Once it goes in the can it all becomes the same tuna when you take it out of there.  The space is very lovely, big windows and bright , airy and sunny.  I would love to go back for a cup of coffee....but I'll get my tuna salad elsewhere for now.   Switch to tuna steaks, add another $1.50 to the price of the salad either that or take $4.00 of the price of the salad and let it be what it is.",

My go-to is usually their pre-made salad with tuna, oven dried tomato, tomato, haricot vert, hard boiled egg, olives, avocado, and mustard vinaigrette. Delicious, filling and worth the $9. I have tried select GF options from their fresh food bar but unfortunately, their portion sizes for the price are VERY poor. However, I can't knock down their rating to 3 stars for that. They make up for it with their GF dessert options. The peanut butter bacon cookie= HOLY DELICIOUS! Sometimes, they offer it as a cookie sandwich with a sweet cream filling. I treat myself to this mouth watering creation a few times a year. If I could get away with it, I'd have one everyday! There are other GF desserts and from what I've tried, they are worth every penny.

Well, before I get too self-congratulatory, I should first admit that today when my co-workers and I went to Market Square to get lunch, I declared that I was going to hit Chipotle.  I may be a snob when it comes to restaurants, but I can appreciate a good chain establishment when I see it, and that one makes my short list.  However, when I walked through the door and came to the horrifying realization that the line was, oh, 4 miles long, I walked right back out with a \"Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.\"  Not worth it.  But, now what?  Every place was crazy busy.  Then, as though my feet were being guided by a higher power, I kept walking away from Market Square towards Wood St., and that's when I saw it: a little, unassuming sign saying \"Bluebird Kitchen\".  And then I knew.  This was The One.  I walked inside, and my little hipster heart lept with joy as I beheld the giant chalk menus, retro-ish tile floor, window-seating counters, tureens of soups, bowls of fresh side salads, and plates upon plates of lovingly prepared assorted cookies.  There were only a handful of other patrons inside, but I knew the tidal wave was coming and I had to act fast as more people steadily walked through the door after me.  I made a quick pass down the line to look at all the food and hemmed and hawed over whether to get a Cuban, Turkey, or the monthly vegetarian sandwich for but a moment before deciding not to over-think and ordering the turkey sandwich, a side of the sweet potato salad, and a lemon crinkle cookie.    Turkey sandwich - excellent quality bread, right amount of meat, and toppings made it all very moist Sweet potato salad - Delightful.  Sweet potatoes were soft, and the crunchy almonds and pears set it off nicely Lemon cookie - Perfection.  Soft, pillowy, buttery, sweet but not *too* sweet.  The only thing that took away from this meal was my fault, and it was that between the sandwich bread, the potato salad, and the cookie, it was a very sweet meal.  I should have ordered something salty like a soup or chips instead of the potato salad to balance out the flavor.  But that's okay; now that I know this place exists and I grabbed a menu, I'll be better prepared for next time.",

I think the highlight of my breakfast was the freshly squeezed orange juice: it was very sweet, natural, and definitely the champion of the day.   I ordered the local fresh eggs on ciabatta with the house made sausage.  I would have given a four if the bread had been toasted,  but it wasnt. The sausage had good flavor, but I would have liked a little salt on my eggs. All in all a good breakfast. If I am back in town I would try the pastries, they looked and smelled amazing.",

As I stood in the corner, the overly-perky blonde with the fake plastered smile told me twice she wanted to use the previously unused register; the second warning intended for me to move when I did not block the paying customer. In a small restaurant when all the seating was taken, there is nowhere to stand, except in front of the door or in line to order. I could see her walk over to another employee, who watched me as the fake, spiky blonde bad mouthed me for not moving.  Regardless of whether the food is good, employees bad-mouthing customers while at the counter turned the choice of this restaurant sour. The customers deserve better treatment than this. My apologies to the owner, but the experience made me regret I went to Bluebird today.",

    "text": "Very impressed! I feel like I'm a pretty tough judge on deli/sandwich shops.  I think it's really easy to make a boring sandwich, salad or side.  They can just end up being bland and not creative at all.  That is NOT the case with this place (look at my rhyming!).    First thing's first.  Everything on the menu looked awesome!  From the sammies to the salads to the sides, it was really hard to decide.  I'm a sucker for roast beef and horsy dressing, so I went with the Roast Beef sandwich.  It definitely held it's own with a nice amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and horsy dressing (I love me some sauce!) on a delish ciabatta bread.    I also sampled the bean salad and pasta salad.  I LOVED the bean salad!  It was super tasty and had great flavor.  The pasta salad was bland.  I wouldn't get that again.  Only loser in the meal though... so I still left a very happy lady.  The bakery part of the deli looked incredible!  I could have gobbled it all up.  I, of course, had to get something!  So I tried the homemade s'more.  It was ooey gooey goodness!  I had my eye on a couple other items I'll certainly be back for, promise!  Although the line was long, it moved along fast and was able to zip in and out in no time.  This is such a great spot for a quick lunch, if I worked downtown I might be tempted to go in every day!  Another new establishment we're lucky to have in the Burgh!",

Annoyingly, they have delicious coffee, but they are cheap on their to-go cups so most of it ends up on your hands, clothes and the street (I've experienced this repeatedly over the past couple of months). But the real killer here was that my salad was filled to the brim with unwashed lettuce (nice and gritty, yum!) and only about 2 ounces of chicken. What justification can I provide for spending $15+ on lunch when they can't even bother to wash lettuce? Maybe it was an off day but lettuce costs $1/head and skimping on toppings to save money is just not acceptable at that price point. So if you are going to go here, skip lunch and coffee and just go for the pastries & breakfast.",

If you have a little extra time in your morning visit your local downtown pittsburgh coffee shop its worth the adventure! My only quip is that it probably took around 10 minutes for them to make my sandwich when nobody was in the shop. Kind of dissapointing considering they have like 3 or 4 people in the kitchen and all i wanted was eggs.   I will be returning soon to try their lunch menu. Im sure I wont be disappointed.",

I came in around 11am to beat the rush (a line had formed by noon) and was greeted with very friendly service. Having not been there before, I didn't realize you placed your order at the beginning of the counter, and then made your way down to the register. I ordered at the register unknowingly  and they kindly took my order there instead.   I had a Cuban, which was warm and toasty and delicious. The pickles and mustard added the perfect tangy flavor to the sandwich. My only complaint is that the piece pork belly on my sandwich was a little fatty, but this was not a problem as I picked it off and ate the good parts as the sandwich was still loaded with ham. Overall, it was a very satisfying lunch.   I ended up going back up after my sandwich to order an oatmeal sandwich cookie- which was huge and delicious- the filling wasn't too sweet.   This place is a little on the pricier side, but completely worth it in my opinion for the noticeably quality ingredients, attentive service, and fresh bright atmosphere that makes for a relaxing lunch break. I will definitely be stopping in again to try the delicious sounding soups and more baked goods!",

However today I went with one of my coworkers back to the Bluebird Kitchen and it I don't think either one of us could wait to review the sandwiches we had. I chose the Cuban sandwich because it is pretty much impossible for me to not eat one when it is an option. This Cuban sandwich was everything a lunch fantasy could be. Packed in between a buttery ciabatta roll, was layers of rosemary ham, pork belly, Swiss cheese, pickles and whole grain mustard. I eat quite a few Cuban sandwiches and this one has surpassed a good majority of any of the ones I have had in the past.   They also have delicious looking cakes and cookies. But I was too overwhelmed by the amount of pig I had committed to eating that I didn't think it was wise to add a macaron the size of my head on top of it. There are also daily specials which include a lot fresh soups and salad.",

Lots of delicious and healthful vegetable dishes and soups that you can get as sides or full meals, or go  with one of their sinful sandwiches and desserts .  I haven't had anything from here that I haven't loved.  The main issues are that the line is usually out of control when I want to go, sometimes the staff takes out their obvious stress from said line on the wrong customer (any customer) and it has to be nice out for me because there's never room to eat inside and it's nice to eat outside in Market Square.

Their last vegan sandwich had Kalamata olives on it, which are great on a sandwich once you remove the pits. I almost broke my tooth. Thinking it's an easy mistake to miss one I continued to eat my sandwich. Every olive on the sandwich still had its pit. When I called to inform them they did not seem too concerned. So enjoy with cation.",

    "text": "\"Discovered\" Blue Bird Kitchen via Instagram while visiting Pittsburgh for the week. I normally don't do repeats when traveling, especially in Pittsburgh where I have many favorites. I made an exception this time however! I stopped in twice for lunch this week, and was very pleased both times.   Somehow I managed to hit the line perfectly on both visits, but the line is a good indicator of how delicious the food is here! The first visit I got a roast beef sandwich, on nicely chewy ciabatta. I took it down to nearby Market Square and enjoyed it while listing to some great live music.   My second visit, I tried the Cuban and a cinnamon brown sugar macaron--flavor explosion! I removed one extra fatty piece of pork from my sandwich, but that's a personal preference/texture issue with me. The macaron was perfect!  With tip, my lunch was less than $15 both visits, which was awesome! They also had a limited dining area, which I took advantage of today, since there was a busy farmers market going on at Market Square.   My next trip to Pittsburgh I want to try their quiche, it looked really good, as did their layer cake of the day. I will also pack more stretchy pants, because I think I gained 5 pounds this week, eating my way through the 'burgh!",

I had the breakfast egg sandwich on a chibatta roll with the additional sausage. To say it was delicious and that it hit the spot is an understatement. Something to be said when a friend egg is cooked just right, so the yolk runs, but not that much.  The sandwich also came with lettuce and tomato with Swiss and cheddar. Yum! So we we decided to go back the next day and don't you know, it was good on that day too. So this is a definite have to visit location. It is my understanding that they have a sister store not to far away as well. Haven't been to that one, but I have to recommend this on not only for the food but for the friendly service that we got.  They also have a special on day old pastry, I had a mixed berries and perch bread pudding that was on point. Great job all around.",

Good variety of tasty artisanal bread, fresh ingredients, and nice, clever takes on the basic sandwiches. She ordered the Turkey, I the Roast Beef. We also got their in-the-restaurant made chips, which were great.   I rated it a little on the low side for me, as the food was slightly on the pricey side for what we got ($30 lunch for 2 for sandwiches, no refills on iced tea). And, we went expecting to eat in. However, it is definitely \"Bluebird Kitchen\" not \"Bluebird Dining Room\". I mean to say that the accommodations for dining in are not good at all, unless you want to sit alone and watch people walk by at the windows. There are three bar tables along the walls of the place, with backless steel 30\" (think low bar) stools for seating. I imagine that most people will be getting food to go and eat at the tables on Market Square, but the weather was too cold for us.",

You can tell a lot of thought was put into building the menu because it's not your average sandwiches and salads; it seems slightly gourmet. I've tried a couple things here and they've all tasted well put-together and very fresh. On top of their regular menu items, they have a daily special along with changing salad options and not to mention their baked goods. The few downfalls to Bluebird Kitchen are the space is small with very minimal seating, the layout is slightly awkward, so if you're not familiar with the place, it's hard to figure out where to order vs. where to pay, and it's only open until 3pm Mon-Fri, which was a real bummer for me when I used to live downtown.",

Glad I was able to beat the lunch crowd today as by the time I finished up my lunch (yes they have small counter tops with stools to sit at) the line was almost out the door.  They have a choice of fresh salads, sandwiches, sides and desserts which rotate daily.  I went with the turkey sandwich on homemade bread (the best bread I have tasted in a while that was thick and so fresh), lettuce, and a bacon jam with cheese.  I picked the potato salad as my side which had a nice mix of regular and sweet potatoes.  Got to sample the brussel sprout salad which was also tasty. Can't leave out dessert and went with the vegan chocolate chip cookie which melts in your mouth!  The only catch is the prices and those 3 things cost $15 but it was worth it.",

I think a sandwich  just might do the trick...\".  I feel that if an owner of a business bothers to reach out to me after a review, I owe it to that person to follow up. So today I stopped into the Blue Bird for lunch and ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Although it was pretty busy, the staff was very cheerful and courtious and I moved through the line rather quickly.  But after paying for my order, I waited for about 15 minutes to get my Cuban, which, in my opinion is a little longer than average for lunch. But like I said, it was busy and there were pleanty of orders to be filled before mine.  There's very limited seating at the Blue Bird so I took my sandwich back to my office which is only about a five minute walk. The sandwich held up well and was still warm when I unwrapped it. Paying $9.10 (tax included here) for a sandwich isn't what I'd call being thrifty but after one bite I could tell that this sandwich was worth every penny! The ciabatta was firm but not too hard. The pork belly and ham blended well with the pickle and mustard. The serving size was just perfect for a hearty appetite (I skipped dinner last night and only had a cup of coffee for breakfast today).  I'm upping the rating to four stars for a delicious sandwich!",

    "text": "Woohoo - Breakfast redemption!  So my less than stellar reviews in the past had to do with my lunch experiences at Bluebird but this morning I went there for a breakfast sandwich and was not let down.    I had the fried egg sandwich on a pretzel roll with sausage.  It was hearty and delicious which is exactly what I needed.  It was freshly made as you can tell with the eggs - the eggs weren't industrially processed to look like a white and yellow cookie.  No, these were real eggs cracked open on a skillet and put into a sandwich.  There were tomato slices and greens.  I think the pretzel roll was a good option as the salt on the bun offered a little something to the unseasoned eggs.  The sausage was a nice complement as well to the sandwich.  They had some amazing looking pastries but I resisted.    I guess I know when I'll be heading over to Bluebird - the early morning when the birds are chirping!    I appreciate the owner reaching out to acknowledge my less than stellar reviews.  I'm glad that I got to give it another chance.",

Previously, if you wanted something other than a donut, bagel or Egg McMuffin, you were pretty hard pressed to find something else.  However, with the opening of the Bluebird Kitchen you will be able to find much more than those breakfast staples.     Recently, I had the opportunity to indulge my southern hankerings for an old fashioned breakfast of grits and eggs.  Boy oh boy, were they delicious!  The stone ground grits were creamy and had flecks of cheddar cheese mixed into the grits along with little nuggets of bacon.  Topped by sunny-side up eggs, this was a breakfast took me back to Columbia, SC where my mother was born.  On another visit, the pastrami cured salmon on a toasted bagel made me believe that beef pastrami may be eliminated as my favorite type of pastrami.  With the addition of cucumber and oven dried tomato, this let me know that this restaurant gets all of the little details right.  You also want to try this restaurant for lunch where the house roast turkey sandwich with bacon jam, that's right bacon jam, is smack your mama good!",

Not bad at all because everything is made fresh and the service is great.   I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which might be the best I've ever had. It had apples, chick peas, and I'm pretty sure some cumin with fresh chicken and a light mayo dressing, all on a croissant. I also got a side of chips which definitely taste fresh and homemade.   I grabbed an oatmeal cookie with chocolate buttercream icing for later, but I'm just going to go ahead and assume that it is also delicious. The prices are reasonable, too.   Definitely going back!",

I haven't been quite as impressed with lunch at bluebird (ergo the 4 stars instead of 5), but that's neither here nor there- let's get back to breakfast.

I used to love the house turkey sandwich, which boasts house roasted turkey breast, butter lettuce, bacon jam, gouda cheese, and avocado. I was downtown this afternoon and decided to treat myself. I got back to my office that is now in Oakland, and I thought they'd messed up the order. I couldn't find the bacon jam or the avocado. I dug through and there was a stingy little swipe of each. So I got a turkey sandwich with lettuce and cheese on multigrain bread for $9.90. Maybe some things are the same as ever, but I'm never going to bother with this place again.",

    "text": "Let me just get this out of the way: Bluebird, when it's good, is REALLY good.  What sucks is, unlike my coworkers and everyone else here on Yelp, I have had more bad experiences with BBK than good.   The first time I went there, I was giddily excited to try their vegetarian sandwich-of-the-month. It was some kind of tofu on ciabatta, and the menu boasted that it had some kind of funky sauce and lots of delicious pickled vegetables.  What I got was a rock of bread with uncooked tofu and beets. Everything was served ice cold. It was gross.  I also tried another veg-o-the-month sandwich a couple of years later. This time it was fried eggplant and some other stuff. Same deal - ice cold, served on rock hard bread, and tasteless.  Then, one day recently, I happened upon this AMAZING potato kale and beet soup. It was one of the best soups I've ever had. I thought my luck with Bluebird was finally turning.  Since then, I have stalked BBK on social media and at the store, looking for another delicious, amazing, vegetarian soup. They never have it. They have no soup, or they only have meat soup.   Today, I went back to Bluebird to check on the soup situation. As I walked in the door, one of the counter workers stared at me with this look of disdain that can only be rivaled by my cat when I spray him with water. She stared, then went behind a pillar with another coworker while I looked at the soups. She came around the wall after a few seconds, and obnoxious giggling, to take my order. I got this miso egg drop soup that was marked gluten-free and dairy-free. I wondered if that meant it was also meat-free, but I didn't want to burden this poor girl with any more of my disgusting demands, so I left.   It had chicken it. I gave it to my coworker, who said it was delicious. Yay.  I wish Bluebird and I had a better relationship. I just don't know what I did to hurt it. But she has burned me, time and again, and it's just not worth all the pain to have one good experience every once in awhile.",

The line moved quickly, the staff was friendly, and we didn't have to wait long at all while our sandwiches were made.   Speaking of sandwiches--the Cuban that I ordered was fantastic! Rosemary ham, pork belly, a delicious mustard dressing, and (of course) pickles came together in a delicious combination. The ciabatta was sturdy and resisted sogginess during our walk back to the office. Nothing worse than a mushy sandwich!  There were so many delicious pastry items and I wanted to try all of them (it took some serious self control not to pick up a dessert--but Girl Scout Cookies are everywhere my the office right now!). I'll be back some morning for coffee and a pastry.   Overall this was a really pleasant experience and I'm excited to return. Such a great little spot!",

That Cuban tho.... Omg so deliciously moist and flavorful and he pickles were awesome. We also decided to have a rhubarb oat bar while we waited for the sandwiches to be made, and that was bomb too.

While their pastries are good, their breakfast sandwiches are bread heavy and lacking in generous filling. Definitely a neat spot, but not worth the wait to visit until Monday morning, since this place is so audacious to be closed on weekends. Can't imagine what the owners are thinking with these hours, as this schedule is the anti-thesis of how small businesses survive and thrive.

The coconut oolong is my favorite!",

    "text": "Although they have some good food, I'm not totally sold on it. For my birthday, some friends have ordered me a pistachio cake which was delicious! It was totally unexpected and I really liked it. I would definitely recommend their cake although it's a bit pricey. Other than the cake, I had mixed feelings about their other dishes. For this visit, I got the chicken salad in a croissant. At first, I really liked it as the mix of apples and nuts were so good and made it crunchy. But I was a bit disappointed in the amount of mayo that it had as I don't like too much of it. I also got a side dish which had carrots, veggies and herbs. This was okay as I didn't end up finishing it.  Overall, I think that the food is a bit pricey but they do have some good stuff. In addition, there is limited space for seating during lunch.",

I had a meeting with a colleague and she had thought that this is a bonafide, sit-down place for breakfast (so did I), but we were both proven wrong! The layout of the restaurant is somewhat strange, with not much sitting area except for two bars along the walls. I ordered a pastrami cured salmon, which I was quite happy with. My colleague ordered a frittata and it was somewhat strange that the frittata came in a bread...I had never seen a frittata as a sandwich...while I didn't try frittata, it was obvious that my colleague didn't like her food and actually ordered a second food as I was leaving because she was not happy with the frittata...I also found the ordering process somewhat weird and I think the barristas could have been more helpful. I thought it was obvious that I was a bit lost when I had gone in at 7 ish in the morning and I was one of the few people in the cafe, so it should have been easy to just quickly guide me to where I should order, but that didn't happen...Overall, it was still a positive experience, but not more than 3.5 stars... Hint: they refill coffee for $1.60.",

    "text": "Bluebird Kitchen is a great little breakfast and lunch spot tucked away alongside Market Square. I am absolutely hooked on their Bluebird Granola, which is a rich Greek yogurt layered with honey and seasonal fruit. It makes a great, filling breakfast. They also have breakfast sandwiches, smoothies, oats and a quiche of the day. For lunch, there are very nice, house made sandwiches, fresh sides, salads and soups. I'm a vegetarian and there is a rotating monthly vegetarian sandwich and salad -- so, even if options are slightly limited, there will always be something for you. Today there was a delicious garden veggie soup that was really chock full of fresh veggies, and it came with a big chunk of bread for about $6. Their pastries are also delicious; I'm partial to the cookie sandwiches with buttercream. The only downside is that it's a small space with only a few counter-style seats available. In summer, no problem as you can take your food outside to Market Square; tougher in winter if you happen to be out and about. Not an issue for me as I generally take my food back to my office, but this makes it a place I don't generally go to eat with someone when the weather is less than ideal.",

Fresh soups, various sandwiches on fresh breads and baguettes, and premade sides like broccoli quinoa salad or a roasted potato salad. Each mouth they feature a special sandwich and salad as well. All the options are quite healthy and everything is so fresh. Very vegan and vegetarian friendly too. Do not leave without a sweet treat--their vegan chocolate chip cookie is to die for. Friendly staff, prices are kind of high, though. The second location on Stanwix is much bigger inside with tables, however they offer a much smaller menu than the original Forbes location.",

I've had my eye on Bluebird for a couple months, and thank goodness I finally found an afternoon without a single reason to walk by. There was actually a line spilling onto the sidewalk, but not being in a rush, I was intrigued by the wait rather than discouraged. I'm so glad this place is living up to its hype.  Bluebird Kitchen belongs in New York. No wait, San Francisco. The point is this place totally elevates breakfast & lunch. Its focus on fresh & local, coupled with its relaxed & rustic yet somehow also sophisticated atmosphere & presentation is unexpected in downtown Pittsburgh. It's high time the East End shared some of the foodie wealth! It's refreshing. The prices are fair ($4-$5 breakfast items, $6-$8 sandwiches, $7-9 salads) The staff is adorable & friendly, too.  All I ordered on my first visit was a white bean, sausage & broccoli soup. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was broth-based, rather than a thick, roux base I anticipated with \"bean\" in the title. I felt like I was at my mom's kitchen table eating this soup, that's how fresh it tasted. I love soup but tend to shy away from eating it in restaurants because it's usually loaded with sodium. This tasted good for me: light yet hearty.   Check out Bluebird, if only for a dessert. I didn't have one but I loved how each cookie looked unique; no pre-mixes here! Enjoy, folks.",

The ingredients were fresh to the bite and enough horseradish aioli to delight and not overwhelm my taste buds and the sandwich. I do like adding chips for a side but found that the sandwich alone was enough to satiate my stomach. If you get there early or late enough you can find parking around market square but if you go during peak hours it won't be so easy to get in and get out.",

We were only open until 12.\" I realize that it is New Year's Eve, but you are a business in a downtown area and people work on New Year's Eve day. This has happened a few times before with this location (their Stanwix location, I was told, has been closed ALL week), so I'm left wondering, are you a small business trying to stay in business?? Just curious because I would be happy to take the $10+ I would have spent (not to mention the 3+ co-workers who were all coming with me to go out to lunch) and spend it at another restaurant in Market Square or Downtown Pittsburgh. Your establishment isn't THAT phenomenal where I need to go back.",

I did however visit for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  At 12:15, the place was pretty full, with people in line wating to order and well as customers waiting for their orders.   There was a pretty decent list of sandwiches, salads and soups.  I opted for the Rotisserie Chicken salad sandwich which had apples, cashews and curry seasoning on a homemade croissant.   I also opted for a side salad of grains and vegetables.  The sandwich ($8.50), was a little bit pricey but, it was pretty fresh and tasty.  The chicken was a bit salty, but all in all the combination was spot on.   There were multiple side salads displayed and available.  I opted for the Farro, strawberries, veggies and figs in a honey balsamic dressing, or at least that's what the sign read.   When I arrived back to my office, I actually had a salad that was completely different with asparagus (I'm allergic) and tofu, savory, not sweet.  I removed the  asparagus and enjoyed the remaining salad.   This place was a bit chaotic, but I would return....the food was good.",

She then said that she didn't know, but that she was sure the chef said there was no meat in the soup. I walked away, but wasn't satisfied with this answer, so I went up again and asked if she could ask someone else what it was that was in my soup I was eating. The cashier then turned to another employee and said \"here you deal with this, I don't know\" and put her hands in the air. The second employee looked at my spoon and said that she didn't know what it was and repeated that it wasn't meat. -__- She then calls the chef to see what was in my soup. The chef observes and says that it looks like chicken and that someone must've used the wrong ladle - causing there to be chicken in the potato soup....Someone who I assumed to be the manager apologized and gave me a refund.

It actually is reminiscent of some places we eat breakfast in Lancaster when we visit there. It was on my list of places to visit, but I never seem to have that list with me when we're trying to decide where to eat. I had the Frittata on a ciabatta roll. That phrase just rolls off the tongue The roll was fresh and soft, not too chewy. The filling was very good and didn't fall out as sometimes happens in such sandwiches. Same for the Local Fried Eggs that my daughter also ordered on the ciabatta roll. She and I shared the Blue Bird Granola, also very good, but I would have liked a bit more honey or fruit to sweeten a little more. My husband had the Biscuits and Gravy which he orders just about everywhere he finds it on the menu. He said it was good which is just about as good as his praise gets. My daughter tasted it, and said it was delicious. We chose to sit at the counter to eat, although we saw many people getting take-out orders. We didn't notice when we entered how close Market Square was or we might have gone there to sit and eat. The seating isn't the best for comfort if you decide to eat there. We also found the paper container for biscuits and gravy a little disconcerting although understandable for take out and the environment. I would recommend the Bluebird Kitchen for breakfast and will return to try other things on the menu.",

Their desserts are uber tasty and unique and the staff is friendly and so helpful, kind, and they know how to dress!  They are super busy during lunch with a line out the door.  So I suggest you go there early (rather than late - they tend to sell out of the specials).   Definitely stop in if you are in the market square area of downtown Pittsburgh.",

Several days I added the sausage to the sandwich: the sausage was hearty and flavorful: tasted like real meat, not grease.  The breakfast sandwich also had a few slices of tomato and lettuce which were great.  Also had an iced Americano a couple days and their iced coffee a few times.  This was quite passable, notably better than the chain around the corner. Happy to find this quality breakfast in the skyscraper part of town.",

    "text": "We stopped into the Bluebird Kitchen for lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  First thing I noticed was the cleanliness and the minimalistic decor.  The counter is a walkthrough line and it moves relatively quickly.  The food options are all listed on the board on the back wall.  I chose the cuban sandwich, the hubs chose the roast beef sandwich and we shared an order of the fresh veggie pasta salad.  I also ordered a green citrus iced tea and the hubs got a bottle of water.  The tea was so good.  I wish I'd gotten a second one to go.  The cuban sandwich was not at all a typical cuban sandwich.  We are long time residents of South Florida and it's difficult to get a real cuban sandwich up here.  Nothing tastes right.  I think it's because folks can't get the Spanish ham or the real cuban bread up here.  The flavor was good, but just didn't hit the spot for a cuban sandwich.  The roast beef was very good.  It had juicy roast beef, roasted red pepper and arugula.  Both sandwiches were served on a fresh baked ciabatta roll.  The veggie pasta salad was delicious! There were tons of veggies (squash, zucchini, tomatoes, and asparagus) as well as white beans and was dressed with what tasted like a homemade Italian type dressing.  The seating inside is limited to 3 counter type areas with stools.  We managed to procure a couple of seats by the window in the front.  Both of us enjoyed our meal and it was great option for a healthy meal on a warm day.  The service was stellar and the ladies behind the counter were super nice and helpful.  I can tell they really take pride in their business.",

Presentation is sometimes in a big box with lots of gravy or in a little box with barely any gravy. (Always 2 biscuits) depending on who is working the amount of gravy varies as well the quality.   I have had the best and the worst biscuits and gravy here but I am always paying $7.49 for a dish comprised primarily of flour and butter. Which isn't worth it most of the time... but when it's good it's damn good.  This has been my experience the past couple years,  good enough (sometimes) to go back but the price and inconsistency are the reason for 2 stars.",

    "text": "Finally! This review is LONG overdue - during the last year or so working downtown has given me multiple chances to eat at the beloved Bluebird Kitchen. I've come here for made-to-order breakfasts and lunches alike, and nothing has disappointed.   Their enormous breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit smoothies leave me feeling full and satisfied, moreso than other places with similar breakfast options; the potato, sausage, egg and goat cheese laden frittata sandwich is a definite favorite. And their lunches are also a wonderful and tasty option should I forget to bring something to work that day. Their roast beef and Cuban sandwiches have been my favorites so far.  If you're the type who likes seasonal items, Bluebird offers monthly smoothies and sandwiches as an addition to the standard menu. I tried their special vegetarian sandwich from last summer (with fried green tomato, grapefruit & cabbage coleslaw) - I admittedly remember that sandwich being on the bitter side, more so than I expected as someone who likes both green tomatoes and grapefruit. It wasn't bad though, and it was certainly a unique flavor profile compared to what I typically find for a quicker downtown lunchtime option.  It's definitely safe to say that this place has knocked it out of the park and made my taste buds very happy time and time again. And that's just considering their main meals - the amazing desserts elevate your meal options to an entirely different level. They're good. They're really good. You should go buy one of them in addition to a sandwich. And oh: this review is based on my limited perusing of the menu - I have yet to try their biscuits, granola, quiche, bread pudding, and salads.  I know getting to Bluebird before they close can be a chore if you're not nearby, but they're worth it. Stop in and enjoy!",

    "text": "Bluebird is the type of place Pittsburgh wants for their next generation. They're trying to be trendier and give a more hipster feel to the new places. Obviously the old diners and blue collar joints aren't leaving, but the people in Pittsburgh are making a real concentrated effort to add things to their city that more resembles something stolen from Brooklyn. I can dig that.  Bluebird is tucked into Forbes right around the corner from Market Square. It's a fresh space with a counter in the front of the store and a couple of tables to the side. Giving a nod to the name, the color tone is a calming blue that relaxes you. It's so warm and inviting you almost forget there's almost no seating for people!  My dad and I both ordered lattes, and I was a bit famished so I decided to order the grits. He went for a blueberry muffin as he has much more self control than me. We received our lattes and pastry almost immediately, and were able to snag two seats at the counter right before my bacon cheddar grits became available.  The lattes weren't my favorite, but they were acceptable enough that if my dad asked to come back I would be okay with it. He enjoyed his muffin and I dug right into the grits. They were perfectly cooked, and included a large mound of cheese and a wonderfully executed runny egg. There was also a lot more than I was expecting; I had trouble finishing it all! My only qualm was that it was served in a cardboard to-go box. I understand that may be the cool thing to do, but it was a little difficult to make sure a huge mess didn't end up on the counter. I can't imagine the mess you'd have to sop up if it were taken to-go.  I would visit here again. I think I may have chosen the wrong drink, but I loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious.",

My group got the salmon bagel, breakfast sandwich, sweet potato corned beef hash, and Southern grits as well as some coffees. Everything was pretty good. I wish on the egg sandwich they would ask how you want the eggs done. Normally I like runny eggs, but they don't work well in sandwich form. I also wanted to try the pretzel roll but they were out. The ordering system is also a little confusing. You order food at the back then order drinks and check out at the front and you have to repeat all the food you ordered. Overall, a good spot for a quick weekday lunch.",

The \"bread\" was a piece of bagel, which seem strange.   Apparently I forgot about my previous experience and stopped by today for soup. I ordered chicken tortilla soup. When I got back to my office I opened my bag and got a strong whiff of chicken noodle. I opened the cup and it looked like chicken noodle. Out of the 3 soup options I didn't think chicken noodle was even an option so I called the shop and asked what was in their tortilla soup. I was told it had chicken, carrots, onions, broth, and little pieces of tortilla. No tomatoes, beans, corn, or anything you would normally find in tortilla soup.  This is when I remembered my previous experience. I will not be returning.",

Bluebird Kitchen does things a little differently than some of the other new places in the Square...it offers breakfast for one.  And the breakfast offerings sound quite nice...but I can't imagine ever having time to swoop down the street in the morning from Grant Street.  That means you lucky folks in the lower area of downtown won't have to fight off we intruders from the the upper area!  I'm envious.  Lunch, however, is another thing.  I'll be back frequently for the fresh salads and other items on the menu!  Lured by the prospect of \"crispy\" porkbelly, I ordered the May's salad.  Besides the aforesaid porkbelly, it consisted of arugula and endive, slivers and flecks of smooth gouda, roasted thyme onions and slivered pear with a mustard vinaigrette I could have eaten with a spoon it was that good!  The porkbelly - and I'm a big porkbelly fan, mind you - left a lot to be desired.  Not crispy at all, it was a generous portion of what appeared to be raw thick-sliced bacon.  I know it wasn't raw....it just looked that way.  It was chewy and had strings of inedible rind.  That went on the side and remained uneaten.  Ugh.  But the salad itself was wonderful.  Next time I'll get ANYTHING other than the porkbelly.  The service is friendly, efficient and QUICK!  You're in and out - even with a line in front of you - faster than you imagined possible.  Don't expect to eat in comfortably...take your prizes outside to the tables in the Square and enjoy some al fresco dining...or take it back to the office.  Side note:  a colleague of mine ordered the porkbelly sandwich and found the same problem with the porkbelly.  Some work is needed on a better preparation of that particular product.",

    "text": "I stopped by Bluebird Kitchen the other day to grab some breakfast. I thought the place looked fantastic and modern. I can tell they must get some decent lunch business because most of the space is reserved for ordering and waiting for your food. There are two long shelf tables where you can sit, a little uncomfortably, and eat your food within. It is nice to be able to eat and look out at the passing downtown crowds though. I got the egg sandwich. It was decent, but I will never understand why one would want lettuce and tomato on a breakfast sandwich. After taking those off, I enjoyed the sandwich. The egg was cooked to perfection and was runny, just as I like it. Fortunately my girlfriend had my back with a handful of napkins! The coffee was good, and hot. No complaints there.  The wait time for my food was a little longer than I had expected, especially since there was not a line to order. I guess that is the trade off for freshly cooked food. I think this place would be exponentially better if they had table service, but the space may not be there for this. Overall, this is a great addition to Market Square and I look forward to trying lunch.",

First time I went (yesterday) I ordered the Croque Monsieur, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was an out of body experience.  The brioche bread was amazing, then add the ham and gruyere, and you have an unreal sandwich.    Today when I went back I ordered the Cuban, and again was thrilled.  I topped it off with a chocolate chip cookie which was delicious as well.    The only draw back is their lack of seating, but I'll happily take my lunch anywhere I can if it tastes like this.    If you are downtown for lunch, don't go anywhere else, I don't think I'll be able to...ever.",

    "text": "So I have been here twice and had two pretty different experiences.  The first time, L and I went for lunch to grab something and bring it back to work to eat in the office since we knew that there was no seating in the place and it was farmer's market day in Market Square.  We both had the veggie sandwich on rosemary and sea salt foccaccia. We also decided to splurge and split the oatmeal sandwich cookie.  Can I just say wow!  Both the sandwich proper and the sandwich cookie were delectable!  The veggies were perfectly cooked - zucchini, red peppers and onions.  They were covered with a lovely melting of cheese.  The sandwich cookie was to die for - much like the one from your childhood, but adult sized and adult taste.  Today, my friend S and I went and were just kind of lukewarm.  I ordered the home made turkey sandwich and he got the chicken salad croissant.  His croissant was much too hard and the salad was more of chicken and mayo.  He opened it to show me and I was surprised there was nothing else in there.  My turkey sandwich had an amazing jam on it - hard to describe, but excellent and the cheese was definitely above par, but the turkey was odd.  I know that it is homemade, but it was too gelatinous for turkey from a place like that.  And the bread was a bit stale which I found hard to believe seeing as how we were the first customers in there.    All in all, I had a fantastic experience and a so-so experience.  I will likely be back in the future with hopes that today was an off day.",

Look, if you want fries on your sandwich, or a crappy buffalo chicken wrap, or processed cold cuts, then this place just isn't for you.  This is real food people. Food that starts out as quality ingredients, that are transformed into a wonderful, delicious products.  When you're baking your own bread and pastries, roasting and braising your own meat... that's cooking. That's what we're supposed to be eating.  I can't say enough about people who treat food  with the proper respect it deserves.  It's absolutely refreshing in this world of chained, crappy, processed, mediocrity.",

The bread was phenomenal, I don't know if they make it or not but it really made the sandwich. I had their tomato and fennel soup which was unique and so good. I tried a brown rice and asparagus side dish that was also absolutely great. My other side was roasted carrots, farrow or barley and a yoghurt sauce which was surprisingly tasty. Overall, great food and I didn't feel guilty about eating it. Will be back.",

The price of the food does not match the quality. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which was handed to me from a cooler in the back, and my boyfriend ordered the August salad, which he was told to pick from the cooler in front. I understand being prepared for the lunch rush, but why even call yourself a kitchen if you're simply handing out prepackaged food like 7-11? My chicken salad was entirely too salty, and my boyfriend's salad had bitter lettuce. Disappointing. And the customer service is likewise disappointing, as other Yelpers have mentioned. No one walks you through the menu, or explains why they serve some foods prepackaged or some foods hot.  TL;DR not coming back and not recommending it.",

The menu is very narrow - and if you have dietary restrictions you're probably down to 1 or 2 sandwich options. They only have 2 hot sandwiches too. It was 10$ for one sandwich and it doesn't come with any sides or anything.   Particularly displeased by the staff. There were 5 people behind the counter who seemed to be very young - probably in their teens or twenties. I'm in my twenties myself, but they were so unprofessional. The gentleman who served me didn't know anything about the menu. It seemed like they didn't have a dress code and I found that they were on their phones or meandering and sitting at the tables for most of the time I was there.   There were two women were great and seemed to be calling he shots. But truly, that's all you needed. Why do you need so many bodies behind the counter? Especially if they're doing nothing and just chatting? My sandwich also took forever to get to me. For some reason they decided that they needed to distribute the 3 people before me and after me all at the same time. Instead of as they were done. So strange.   Also a car alarm went off outside for a couple minutes and it seemed like the world was ending for the staff. \"Omg does someone not care at all about their car\" and \"wow this is SO annoying\" was all I heard. They were more whiny and annoying than the car themselves!   Hard pass on this place. So many more cheaper, and better places in market square. Not going to come back until they have a management intervention.",

I started my day with the Chocolate Chip Espresso Scone and an Early Grey tea... both we're perfect.   Then by lunch time the pastry case filled with an entirely new assortment + a variety of cold salads. They have a hot menu for both breakfast and lunch as well as pre-made salad options if you're on the run. The wait for food orders didn't seem to take long.   They have plenty of stool seating around the perimeter of the room. If you're lucky on a sunny day you can sit right in front of the large windows facing into market square.

    "text": "I'm not often downtown during the weekday but now and then I get that opportunity. Bluebird kitchen is a small take out cafe where everything is made from scratch. They serve breakfast and lunch and close at 3 weekdays only.  Breakfast is served until 10:30 with lunch service starting at 11. If you prefer to eat in then there is a long bar overlooking the outside window and another off to the side. Portion sizes are very generous and you do get more bang for your buck here. Everything is made in house here.  Since the day of my visit was frigid cold I wanted to order one of their three soups they make daily. The potato leek soup looked inviting and it comes in two sizes. It also comes with a fresh cooked roll. I was going to order a sandwich to go with it but after learning they were big I decided to stick with a side of Brussel Sprouts, squash, red pepper and white bean medley.   Some of their food is marked vegan and gluten free options are also available. The entire menu is on separate chalkboards along with a listing for coffees, teas and Sam Pelligrino. They also have a grab and go fridge just below the check out area for things such as salads, cold bevvies and other things that need refrigerated.  The staff is very helpful. You order on one side and they will bag up your items in cardboard when you are ready to check out. After paying I sat down and believe me that soup was so soothing and good that I felt a lot warmer already.  You can also tell it was homemade by the way it tasted. The Brussel sprout medley was also very good but very filling!!! I was so tempted to get a dessert especially when I was eyeing those double decker macaroons but I was already too stuffed. You have a great selection from consisting of anything from parfaits, cookies, breakfast pastries, and double decked goodies.  Bluebird kitchen has a 2nd location at 11 Stanwix St  not too far from here by Keybank. They also do catering. Information is available online or in the shop.  This is a great spot for the working class and you can get a descent meal for a good price. Located on Forbes Ave across from Revel + Roost and Millie's ice cream public transportation is available.",

I almost always get the Tuna Nicoise salad- it's huge and has a delicious mustardy dressing paired with it. My only complaint is all the salads are premade- I'm sure they are made that day but I like to be able to customize so would prefer them being made in front of me. There is always a line so get there early! They also serve coffee and baked goods- which always look amazing!",

The cookie sandwiches are a great sweet midday treat, but best to split if you don't want a sleepy afternoon.   In addition to the baked goods, Bluebird offers a number of hot and cold daily sandwiches and specials. The sandwiches all come on homemade bread and are a substantial amount of food. They also serve two soups and salads which rotate on a daily basis. Bluebird has a great location right off marker square, and while there is seating, it's limited so most people take out. It can also be busy during peak lunch time if you're ordering a hit sandwich while crunches on time.",

It is a little tough to read through the menu before it's your time to order and it's helpful just to ask what types of baked good are available - you can see things but there aren't signs to tell you what's what.  My blackberry muffin was incredible tender, studded with big whole blackberries that somehow didn't make the muffin gloppy. I was shocked at the $2.50 price tag - super affordable for this type of freshly baked good. I only regret I had one morning free to eat here!   Order at the counter, then find a place to sit. They'll call you when your food is ready to grab.",

I normally order just a regular coffee and it's pretty good; they serve Counter Culture Coffee.  The staff is normally wonderful! They're friendly and very helpful.   I normally get my order to go. This cafe is definitely on the small size. There's no tables, just one long counter against one wall and another against the window both with bar stools. It can get crowded if you during the morning rush.   This a great place if you're looking for a quality breakfast downtown on the go.",

Their breakfast ends at 10:30, and the transition between 1030 and roughly 11:00 AM. The only items available are what's available at the front, and nothing is sent to the back. I ordered a spinach and kale quiche, that took about seven or eight minutes to warm up. When I received it, part of it was still cold probably because of the size of the quiche which was more than generous. I felt like it lacked certain degree of flavor, but the eggs were extremely soft and fluffy. The crust was also crispy. I do not think it was anything to write home about. Coffee was strong as I had hoped. I also got a blueberry doughnut cake, which had a dense consistency, and I enjoyed the real strawberries. It was a perfect combination with the coffee.",

The vegetarian selections were limited, but I decided on the quiche of the day, which happened to be made of broccoli, sweet potato and gruyere. They took the time to warm it up for me (it did take approx 8 minutes for anyone in a rush), and I took it to go. I didn't get a chance to eat it until later in the day, but it was by far the greatest quiche I've ever eaten in my life. The egg had a pudding like texture, the crust was hearty and not soggy at all, and the flavors were on point. Every time I eat any type of egg based food I usually have to eat it with hot sauce or ketchup, but this quiche needed absolutely nothing. I would absolutely come back to get it again if I'm ever back in town.  On another note, there is no table seating - just stools and two long counters facing either the outside window or the side wall.",

Feta, cucumber, almonds, dates, lemon zest and a champagne vinaigrette. SO good!  My dad had a spinach chicken soup which he loved, as well as the house roasted chicken salad.

But my favorite eats are the salads - beet with lime and cilantro, cauliflower with chickpeas and curry, spinach with oranges.  All so good!  I'm totally on board with the restaurant's idea to source fresh, local, foods and craft the menu items as appropriate.  Oh and the baked goods are a treat!

It had a couple of thin toppings of their specialty condiments (avocado and something else) but it was very dry.  I asked for some mustard and was offered a mustard dressing for 80 cents.  I asked if they just had some plain mustard and, after checking with the kitchen, was told no.   A sandwich shop without mustard?  The sandwich would have been perfect for $5 or even $8 on the high end, but I paid nearly $10 for a basic sandwich and a glass of ice water with no table service.   Wanting to give them one more chance and still hungry, I decided to try their Peanut Butter cookie sandwich (2 cookies filled with a cream frosting).  Once again, the taste was okay (although slightly burned and overlooked), but the cost was nearly $3.   I probably won't be going back soon.",

The entire staff is so friendly and helpful.  If you're not sure about any of the menu options they are always ready to explain and even offer suggestions. The soups are absolutely delicious.  The coffee and beverage selection is unique and equally as tasty as the food options.   The pastries are on another level.  I always have such a hard time walking past them on the way to the register without picking up one.   DEFINITELY try Bluebird and I'm positive you'll become a regular, too! I wish there was a 6 star option, because they totally deserve it.  I'm so grateful there's a lunch option like this in Market Square!",

Much appreciated as I am aware of how much of a pain special dietary needs can be.  Best Soy Lattes in town, hands down- they come with two shots of espresso: perfect. Vegan chocolate chip cookies are to die for- prefer them over normal cookies.  Highly recommended. Sure, a bit pricey, but I you want homemade you have to pay for it. Absolutely worth every penny!",

Wood counters, huge thick cutting boards displaying baked goods, jazz playing, and artfully written chalkboard menus on the wall.  The coffee is good, and the breakfast sandwiches are better.  I had local fried egg + cheddar on a pretzel roll, which to my delight was HUGE and came with fresh lettuce and tomato.  For $4?!?!  Take that, Egg McMuffin.  The husband had pastrami cured salmon and cucumber on an everything bagel.  He said it was awesome.  We will definitely make more breakfast stops here, but I'm also looking forward to trying lunch.  Everything on the menu looked so delicious, plus they had pumpkin pecan bread pudding...couldn't bring myself to order it for breakfast, but I'm going to have to try it someday soon!",

    "text": "This place is so new that when my friend suggested we go there for lunch, I had never even heard of it.  Fortunately, always up for something new, I agreed to go and I think I found a new favorite lunch spot downtown!  Bluebird Kitchen is located just around the corner of market square, next to Chipotle, and really sticks out as an original, non-chain, clean and cute bakery/eatery.  The inside is a gorgeous open space and very clean.  Their lunch menu is made up of an extensive selection of sandwiches, soups, salads and various sides.  (I didn't see the breakfast menu, but was informed they will start serving it tomorrow.)  In addition to lunch and breakfast, they had an array of delicious looking desserts.  The best part about Bluebird Kitchen is that everything is homemade daily, which is so refreshing.    For my lunch I got the Cuban sandwich and a cup of gazpacho.  My sandwich, served warm, was to die for!!  I could eat this sandwich for every meal and be a happy girl, except now I'm too intrigued and want to try everything else.  I did try to order the chicken salad sandwich at first, but they were all out of chicken salad.  (I went for a late lunch and they said this was a best seller - obviously I will be back to try it asap.)  My gazpacho was refreshing - I prefer a little more spice in mine, but I'm sure it's a bit different every day since it's made fresh.    As my friend and I were waiting for out food to be made, the owner, Liz (I think,) came to chat with us and was super friendly and genuinely interested in what we ordered.  She even offered me a free dessert while we waited!  (She clearly knew the way to my heart.)  I thought she just meant a free sample, but she gave me a whole gigantic cookie sandwich!  I'd be lying if I said this didn't make my day, maybe even week. :)  I got the chocolate cookie sandwich with pistachio filling.  Honestly, every dessert looked marvelous but I have a soft spot for pistachio desserts.  Like everything else, this cookie sandwich was excellent and I wish I could eat a dozen of them at once.  My only suggestion would be that they put some chairs or seating in the space.  There are bar tops along two walls that some people were eating at standing up, but the space is definitely big enough to put in some small tables/chairs or at least stools at the bar tops.  My friend and I had planned to eat outside so this didn't affect us - it would just be a nice option.    I will be recommending this place to everyone I know - I even grabbed some menus to put in my office.  I really hope the best for this place and think we need more unique eateries like this downtown.  I can't wait to go back and slowly, but surely, try the rest of the menu!",

Whenever I have cash in my wallet, and am craving a delicious homemade sandwich, I go here on my lunch break!  My favorite would most certainly by the amazing Chicken Salad Sandwich. Filled with chicken, mayo, granny smith green apples, cumin, and cashews on a huge croisant roll, it will fill your stomach to the point of bursting.  More often than not, I have to wrap up the other half and take it home!  The delicious bakery portion of the small cafe always smells delicious (however, I'm a picky eater, and haven't found something I'd like to try).  The only complaint is that the wait times are a bit too long (especially if you want lunch; but come 10 minutes before 11am, which is when they start serving it). However, the above was solved by asking if their was a solution; they told me to call to place a to go order about 5-10 minutes before leaving work and it'll be ready by the time I get there)! How great is that customer service?!  All in all- I hope they NEVER take the Chicken Salad Sandwich off the menu. If so, I'm sure I'll find something just as delicious when I go back week after week!",

    "text": "I went here twice in two days. The first for lunch, where I had the salad with tuna, hard boiled egg, oven dried tomatoes, and haricot verts and a GF peanut butter bacon cookie. The cookie was so amazing! I was dubious at first of the flavour but was really surprised at how much I liked it! If you're looking for a quick salad, this is a good option because they are pre-made with your choice of dressing on the side. The next day I came back for breakfast with a friend. Although the experience was fine, I was a little bit irked with the service. First, we wanted to share the \"frittata\" and a smoothie. It is unclear on the menu that it's actually a frittata sandwich served on a roll. Being gluten free, my friend asked for a substitute for the bread -- anything without wheat. The girl helping us said we could get the granola/yoghurt INSTEAD of the bread, but when we went to check out she charged us for the whole parfait. If I hear \"instead of\" without a follow up of a price change, I assume it's for free and don't want to be charged for it. We ended up having just the frittata without bread which was fine. The other problem was that I asked for almond milk for my coffee and the girl said they didn't have any almond milk but could give me soy milk. But we had ordered the \"April smoothie\" which had almond milk in it and when I asked about that she said, \"oh right, I was going to make it with soy milk.\" We ended up not having a problem with the soy milk, but I think it's dangerous to not mention it because it is possible we had a soy allergy and specifically ordered the smoothie because of the almond milk! We didn't mind the soy milk in the smoothie at all, but I think it is something they should have mentioned to us before making it. I wanted to get another peanut butter bacon cookie, but they said they don't sell them at breakfast which is a huge bummer! I hope I can come back and have it again another time soon.",

Their quinoa salad was the perfect protein packed snack consisting of arugula, gouda, and apples. I enjoyed the refreshness of this side dish and would definitely come back on an empty stomach to try their entrees!",

I ordered the local egg sandwich with bacon on ciabatta. Tasted great and nothing short of how I pictured it. I also ordered their smoothie of the day (kale, blueberries, etc.). That's where it went all wrong. I saw the staff use their bare hands to put the fruits and vegetables in while wiping his hands on his pants with the occasion combing of his hair. I wish I didn't see all that. I couldn't sit back and drink that...I had to ask for him to keep the drink. I swapped it with their freshly squeezed orange juice. This time he put on his gloves...the juice was delightful but the outside of the cup was all sticky (he probably didn't care at that point). And this all happened during the first visit. The second visit, I ordered the local egg sandwich with bacon on a pretzel roll. However, I got the sandwich on a ciabatta roll. Sandwich was good but wasn't what I ordered. Wish the staff was more attentive...",

This morning I stopped in for oatmeal and a coffee and had to ask one of the employees to take my order. Apparently she was taking a phone order but never told me that. I told her what I wanted and waited patiently while she continued to talk on the phone.   More people came in and other workers took their orders. After about 5-10 minutes I became frustrated and told another employee how long I had been waiting and then left.   This is not the first time I've experienced bad customer service at Bluebird. Most of the workers are rude and unfriendly.",

Today I stopped in for the Baby Romaine salad that they've had on the menu since they opened (another favorite of mine). Unfortunately, their salads seem to be similar in quality and flavor these days to the ones you find in the cooler at a Rite Aid or CVS. Whatever they did to the marcona almonds made them seem chewy and stale, the romaine was wilted and browning, and there were barely any dates.  With tax, it wasn't a great way to spend 8 bucks on lunch. Here's hoping they get back to the fresh old days.",

The total was over $400!!! that's over $20/person, for fruit and quiche! I could understand that price if I was serving some gourmet breakfast spread; but this was not gourmet. The quiches were pretty good and the fruit was fresh, though the pastries were pretty bland and unappealing...most of them went untouched.  I am not sure what is more outrageous when I look at the bill; the $37.50 for paper plates and utensils or the $55 for two boxes of coffee. That is literally twice the price of a box of joe from Dunkin. Absurd. I'm glad they didn't deliver, who know how much that charge would have been!",

    "text": "My favorite spot for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh. The food is delicious and inspired - not the generic sandwiches and sodas you get at a corner deli. I've had their soups, sandwiches, sides, desserts, and coffee. The breakfast menu looks amazing as well but I'm never downtown for breakfast so I can't say much about that.  The prices are a bit higher for a meal than, say, nearby Chipotle or Subway, but the quality of the food you get more than makes up for the difference in my opinion. I usually get a small soup and small side and that's enough for a satisfying lunch for me and comes out to be about $7-8. They have a core menu of items and also daily and monthly specials so there's always something new to try. One thing to keep in mind is that the sandwiches are made to order while the salads are pre-made that morning and in to-go boxes.   Seating is limited to bar-style seating along the wall and windows, which works fine for me since I'm usually just looking to grab a quick lunch during the workday and not to have a long sit-down meal.  I hope Bluebird Kitchen never leaves downtown because there's really no other similar spot downtown like it.",

I got the tofu banh mi, one of my dining partners ordered the roast beef sandwich with lentil side salad, and the third person ordered chicken chorizo quinoa soup and a biscuit. The tofu banh mi was flavorful and had been marinated in a salty brine, was served with pickled veggies on a crusty baguette with some sort of bean tapenade. I would have liked more bold Vietnamese flavors, but the springtime-y pickled veggies were really nice. The roast beef was a major hit, as was the pineapple lentil salad. The chorizo chicken soup was described as bland, but not bad. I've only ever had amazing experiences with soups here, so I believe this must have been a fluke. The pastry course (which I strongly recommend that everyone indulge in at Bluebird) consisted of an almond torte, a lemon tarragon mini-cupcake, earl grey shortbread cookie, and a carrot bundt cake. Each was its own perfect little bite of dessert extravagance, and I found that I was amazed at the skill and restraint of the pastry chef. The carrot bundt cake had a bit of orange zest and salt in the icing, which perfectly complemented the rich earthiness of the moist carrot cake. A favorite amongst all of us was the earl grey shortbread cookie.  As usual, the place impressed and was a fantastic stop for lunch. Sandwiches and salads are nearly always fantastic, and the meal was great with a few reservations.",

    "text": "On one side of Forbes Avenue sits Cherries Diner, epitomizing tradition. On another sits Bluebird Kitchen, blinding eyes and palates with sharp, futuristic decor, and a forward-looking menu. Yet, both are comfortable and appealing to me in every way and in their own way. Will Old Pittsburgh be alienated by the shiny novelty of Bluebird Kitchen? Will Young Pittsburgh embrace Bluebird Kitchen and reject Cherries as a relic? Can they coexist? I truly hope so.   The other morning, a change in my schedule presented me with no other breakfast mission than to try Bluebird Kitchen.   Being a blue-collar man in the morning, I was hollow in the belly. My innards were disturbed and gnarling.   My first meal consisted of Sweet Potato Corned Beef Hash (a small order), Pastrami Cured Salmon, Black and White Trifle, and freshly-squeezed orange juice.   The hash was unorthodox, resembling dirty pasta in a cardboard Chinese takeout container. This was not a heavy, thick, oily hash one gets from a can nor was it crisped via a flat top grill. Not that I don't enjoy those manners of corned beef hash as well, but this put my culinary mind in a trick. Instead of cubes drowning in a muddy sea of red meat, the potatoes were stringy, again, like spaghetti, and bits of corned beef and bacon merely acted as flavorings with those potato tendrils being the central component. Was an Asian influence at work here? I don't know, but I do know that sugar, salt, and starch butted heads within that box and created a very enthralling side dish that was almost grotesque to behold yet possessive of gorgeous flavor and an odd but welcome al dente/brittle texture.   And if I didn't think that breakfast could get more complex, there was THAT sandwich...  I'd been craving salmon and cream cheese in some configuration for a little while now and BK's (not he, the Burger King who should be killed) satisfied that yen tenfold. The \"house cured\" salmon tasted like a wonderfully warmed-through, smooth, soft, silky sashimi that was only rounded-out by the inclusion of the mild, white velvet of the cream cheese spread. Cucumber brought the crunch factor, oven-dried tomato acted as the natural sugars, and with a pretzelesque bagel came the chew and the brine. A cool (literally as well as figuratively), calculated, supraintelligent breakfast sandwich, PCS owns the sunrise much like the hash did; with subtle tastes and punctuating mouthfeel.   I came close to ordering the Breakfast Bread Pudding, but when I saw that cup with the decadent to behold ebony/ivory filling and was told what as in it, my plans were diverted.   I get the feeling that some stale brownies needed to be used up (BK was selling ones of the mint variety), and if that was the case, then there was no more brilliant way than to break them up into bricks, suffocate them with a luxuriously corrupt funereal white buttercream, and rain chocolate syrup death onto this grave for the day-old and baked. My pupils disappeared as I scooped each spoonful into my jaws as evidenced by the morbidly curious stares I received from passersby while seated near a window. Too debauched to be had on such a radiant cockcrow, morning soon fell to mourning...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnMg80LiH_kY&s=43d8b06b12cbd80b021069e69c2ed2a89855edb181cdae2a1f0639dafb39a7d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=nMg8...</a>  And after finishing my deathly dessert, I turned to the young woman that waited on me, threw two thumbs up in the air, and cracked a smile, which she returned, this edible battle for my soul only replenishing it. The cup of tart, nutritious, pressed afresh sunshine that was the orange juice rejuvenated my spirits further.   Speaking of which, the employees are decidedly hipster sans the slack, snobbishness, or casual disdain. I felt as if these tattooed, fashionable whippersnappers were waiting for me to stop in so as to impress me. If so (yeah, riiight, like they were just dying for Yelp's Darren W. to come by for all of these months), they succeeded. Their prices are affordable. Their fare is evidently creative and appetizing. Their service is relatively keen, clever, and kindly. Their local-first ethic is admirably conscientious of the land, sea, and air. Their all-inclusive enthusiasm is undeniable. What minion of the Redhead coos \"Hellloooo\" to every single patron as they walk in the door and towards the counter like she's a friend of theirs?   So, why exactly are you still dancin' with The Clown before work? Break the habit. Turn to the Bird.",

We had the vegetarian and the Cubano and neither of them lived up to our expectations. The seasoning and balance of ingredients just wasn't quite there. The bread was the only thing that really stood out to me. Would I come here if I worked nearby? Absolutely. I wouldn't go out of my way though. I like the idea of having higher end sandwiches in Pittsburgh, but the execution needs a bit of work.",

One of our group had been to some kind of major meat-o-rama meal the night before and was craving salad. So I popped \"salad\" into the Yelp app, and it sent us here.  There were salads indeed, as well as sandwiches and soups. What there wasn't was much in the way of seats, so we were lucky to be only three and to find room at a side counter. I had the April's vegetarian sandwich, and my companions both had a tuna nicoise salad. Although my sandwich was good, I think my lunchmates got the better deal. There was simply more food there. I was still hungry after my sandwich.  I tried to order an infamous vegan cookie (I say \"infamous\" like I know anything about it, but I was just going by the Yelp reviews), but they were all out. I was partially assuaged by the availability of green tea.",

So he buys a dilapidated lunch truck, renovates it, and starts selling the most amazing Cubanos.  Thanks to social media, his lunch  truck becomes a huge hit.  The movie features so many mouth watering close-ups of  delicious food being made, I almost cried into my $8.00 box of popcorn!  And I've had a hankering for a good Cubano ever since.  And now I've found one, thanks in part to Yelper DJ J. 's sandwich list and review.  I haven't had many Cubanos before, but this was that perfect blend of ham and  pork belly, served on a yummy carba-licous  ciabatta roll.  I know a sandwich is good when I want to slowly savor each bite rather than wolf it down.  And what better way to top off a Cubano than with a nice cup of fair trade coffee?  I think next time I come here I'll try the Pain Bagnat.  Or maybe I'll come for breakfast and try the pastrami cured salmon.  But in the meantime Carl Caspar (Jon Favreau), you and your lunch truck have met your match!",

By the end of the trip, I had eaten here four times, twice for breakfast and twice for lunch.  I still remember that first breakfast. Studying yelp, I found this spot and saw a review for a fried egg sandwich, and considering I was pretty much drooling, I threw on my jacket and headed that way. Wanting to size up the review, I ordered without hesitation the egg sandwich, which came on a fresh ciabatta roll topped with lettuce and tomato. I added a piece of local pork sausage for a few bucks. The taste was ridiculous. Freshly baked bread; hot sausage; hot egg; cool and crisp lettuce and tomato. The presentation was just as good. I'm standing there on a cold morning, and it is drizzling outside, and I am handed this piece of waxed paper, which contains a $6 breakfast sandwich that is better than pretty much egg sandwich I've ever eaten.  Lunches are equally as delicious. I had a quinoa wrap and some wheat salad on one day. I had a roasted turkey sandwich on another. Everything I ate here was delicious. The coffee was strong and flavorful. The price was what you would expect for food of this quality.  There is a small counter for eating in, but that's it. Most people grab food to go. I hope I am in Pittsburgh again soon to eat here again.  Five stars.",

For this reason, I've only been able to try their breakfast foods (lunch isn't served until 11) but I've been impressed with everything I've had.   Their breakfast sandwiches are hearty but not too heavy, and the pastries are light and satisfying. I love the flavor combinations: orange and pistachio, blueberry and almond, coconut and cashew, classic mixed berry... and to top it all off, the prices are comparable/lower than chains or other cafes like this one.   Everything is made in-house, so even if you go for the day-old half-price pastries, it's still fresher than just about anything else you can find in the area. Plus the counter staff are friendly without being onobnoxious or annoying. Bluebird Kitchen is definitely the type of restaurant Pittsburgh needs more of.",

    "text": "Before heading to Pittsburgh this past weekend, I consulted a friend online about where some of the best local spots downtown were. He had mentioned that there were many changes happening in downtown Pittsburgh; both good and bad. When the boyfriend and I walked over to Market Square, just a mere block from out hotel, I was saddened to see major chain restaurants slowly taking over the area surrounding this adorable public space. Chipotle and Starbucks have been making their presence known next to old oyster houses and a dying breed of long-standing locals. However, there was a glimmer of hope just outside of the square. Bluebird Kitchen has only been open for a few months, but I can say with confidence that it is one of the most charming local spots in town.  We only had a couple of days to explore Pittsburgh, so we got up early and wandered a few blocks away from The Fairmont hotel and grabbed a quick breakfast at Bluebird Kitchen. It seems that this place is more of a grab-and-go type of spot for locals and business folk on the run. Prices were incredibly reasonable and the quality of ingredients were top notch; from house-made breads, local eggs, and even agriculturally responsible meats and organic produce. We both ordered their egg sandwich which was a steal at $4. Served on a thick pretzel roll with fried local free-range eggs with crisp lettuce, cherry tomatoes and gooey cheddar and Gruyere cheeses. I opted for some house-made sausage on my sandwich (an additional $1.25); light and full of flavor.  A hefty breakfast for two clocking in at under $10? We will surely return on every Pittsburgh trip. The lunch menu looks pretty great too.",

With a solid lineup of sandwiches, and a fantastic array of daily sides to choose from, this restaurant strikes that perfect balance between a cool, light lunch on a humid summer day, to a warm and filling meal in the middle of winter.  To start off, the sandwiches are killer. From the somewhat healthy turkey to the not-at-all healthy cuban, each sandwich has its own personality, with its own bread, its own sauce, and of course, its own meat. Pair that with a side of brussels sprouts, wheatberry, quinoa, or farro, and you've got yourself a very satisfying meal.  But above all of that, I'm in love with the potato chips. Now, I don't know what they add to those potato chips, but I would not be surprised if there were cocaine, because these chips are addicting. So, on top of your sandwich, your healthy side, make sure to add some crack chips to balance out all that flavor.  Enjoy!",

Great location - Market Square - and a unique lunch place for Pittsburgh. Reminded me of lunch joints in NYC. A little pricey for an la carte, grab and go lunch, but I wouldn't necessarily say overpriced - worth the extra few dollars for quick and easy, good, fresh food. There are places to sit along the windows and walls - high top bar stools along the perimeter of the inside - but it seemed most took their food to go...I'm sure when it's really warm outside it would be great to grab a salad, soup or sandwich (or cookie!) to take to the square and enjoy.",

After I ordered I moved over to the cash register line. It took awhile to get the frittata and they forgot that I had also ordered a mocha (coffee). So then I had to wait for them to make that.  I took my food and coffee to go and went to enjoy the nice day while sitting at a table at Market Square. The mocha was very good and very strong.  The ciabatta bun was fresh as for the actual frittata there was only one or two small pieces of sausage. There were a lot of potatoes. It seemed more like a potato sandwich.  For a breakfast that cost $12 I expected better service and better food. I brought home a menu to see if anything caught my eye enough to make me want to go back and try lunch.",

    "text": "Grossly underwhelmed with my visit to Bluebird this morning. I've been hearing so many great things about it, and just had to try it. I was met with fairly rude service, and when I tried to order breakfast I was told that they had stopped serving breakfast. So I tried to order lunch, but was told they weren't serving lunch. So my pickings were pretty slim. I had a slice of the Quiche and the small Sweet Potato Hash. The hash was quite flavorful, however the \"small\" size is more like a spoonful (plus it was lukewarm). The quiche was ok, but it tasted pretty watery and lacked a lot of flavor you'd expect to taste in a Quiche.   I love the concept of this restaurant, I just had a bad experience. It seems silly to me to drop $9 on a pretty mediocre (and SMALL) breakfast. I'll be back to try lunch sometime, I'm just not in a huge hurry.",

    "text": "I was surprised to see the amazing ratings that Bluebird Kitchen has on Yelp and just had to try the restaurant when I started working downtown!  The restaurant is extremely busy during the weekday lunchtime hour. During the two times that I've been, the line is at least 15-20 people long. I recommend planning to get takeout since seating is very limited.  I have tried the Chicken Salad sandwich, House Roast Turkey sandwich, Chocolate cookie \"sandwich\" filled with a Pistachio cream, and a Chocolate Strawberry cupcake. The Chicken Salad sandwich was good but a little too heavy, and I ended up throwing half of it away. I wasn't expecting much from a basic turkey sandwich, but the House Roast Turkey was amazing! I will definitely be ordering that sandwich again sometime soon. The desserts were disappointing, especially for the high price ($3.50 for the cupcake). Though I liked the concept of the two, both the chocolate cookies and cupcake were very dense, while the icing on the cupcake was too rich and tasted like butter. I will not be trying their cookies or cupcakes again.  Of the four things I've tried, I would only re-purchase one of them. Based on this, I can only give the restaurant 3 stars. However, I definitely plan on trying Bluebird again and will re-review if I have a better experience in the future!",

    "text": "Being able to make \"put a bird on it!\"-related jokes is probably the only  reason I didn't give this place 1 star. I was in Pittsburgh for an extended weekend, and having already had some great food on the Square, thought to hit this place up. Let's start with the food and drinks: coffee was mediocre at best, and although they told me my Americano had four shots, it certainly didn't taste like it. Food? Dismal. I had a Cuban that should be emargoed, and the price was Bay of Pigs-level ridiculous.   But here's the kicker! You can serve crap coffee, barely edible food, and STILL be a decent cafe as LONG AS your staff is moderately friendly. But not so at Bluebird! I was not thanked for my purchase, I was questioned when I asked for the WiFi password to be written down for me, and was neither greeted nor even given a friendly goodbye by the 3 staff that were busy thinking of other creative ways to be rude to their clientele (I can only assume).    I know what you're thinking: they were probably super busy painting birds on things, and just didn't have the time....NOPE! My friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant.   In conclusion.  Save your hard earned coins for a place that will at least serve you a half-decent cup o'joe.",

I was with a group of five and received my order at least ten minutes after the last person in my group. I asked a worker if there was an issue and was given a snippy response in return. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, which had an underwhelming amount of every ingredient on it... roast beef, aoli, onions.   Overall, would not recommend. I could've gotten Dibellas or any of the other nearby sandwich places for more food and better service.",

    "text": "My mom never made food for us that SHE didn't like, so I grew up through a childhood without chili, Mexican food and biscuits & gravy. Sickening, right? Once I grew up old enough to buy my own food, I realized how much she truly deprived me. First off, Mexican food is my all time favorite, so it really is a crying shame that she did that to me. Secondly, due to my sheltered past the only kind of biscuits and gravy I've ever had is Grands biscuits with gravy from the grocery store. I never realized how life changing homemade biscuits and gravy can really be. Bluebird Kitchen has the absolute best ever--unless your mom made them for you homemade, then you might not think they are the \"absolute best\" but you can't dispute that they are darn good.  The biscuits were flaky and had just the right amount of crunch to go perfectly with the gravy. The gravy had homemade sausage in it and was lick the plate good. I also had the fried egg sandwich with homemade sausage. That was really delicious too. The best part of Bluebird Kitchen is the fact that everything is locally made and that they use quality ingredients.  Only downside was that it was a little slow but keep in mind they are making everything fresh for you -- it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. We weren't in a hurry though, so I'm not docking them any stars. There was a girl that decided to cancel her order because she was in a hurry and didn't have time to wait.  Service is always #1 to me and there was the nicest guy working the counter. He apologized to us for the long wait and was very pleasant.   This is another spot that I have Yelp to thank for leading me there!",

Two weeks ago I went in for a breakfast sandwich and after a 15 minute wait I finally got my sandwich. When I went to office and unwrapped my breakfast, I saw 1 egg, covered in pepper (so much that it looked like cigarette ash), with LETTUCE AND TOMATO and the smallest little piece of cheese. Now waiting for 16 minutes wasn't great but getting LETTUCE and TOMATO on a breakfast sandwich?? I didn't ask for lettuce and tomato and this isn't listed on the menu. Why would it be? And all the pepper and the tiniest bit of cheese?? I will pay for quality, freshly made food and I'll even tolerate so-so service but I can't deal with really terrible food.   I will say the Stanwix store is so much better. I only go to that location and only get the granola which is amazing.",

The location is a little unexpected (we went to the one on the ground floor of the First Niagara building) and the hours they keep don't permit me to visit very often. They are open 7-2 on weekdays and not at all on weekends to my knowledge. The food was delicious but I was sad that they didn't have the selection of cookies and other treats I see featured on their Instagram account. I'm going to need to make a special trip to the Market Square location before school starts! Good food and nice beverage selection - great brunch stop!",
