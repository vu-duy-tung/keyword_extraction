    "text": "I love this place and chose to have my birthday dinner with a group of friends this year! I called a couple of weeks in advance to get on the calendar (not sure if that's necessary, but I was glad to have it all sorted). We got there at 8 - there was a group of 10-12 people at each of the 3 long tables in the place. Packed so tightly I couldn't push my chair back at all, because it was pressed against that of the person behind me. This is not meant to be a deterrent - it just reminds you that you're somewhere special.   After passing around some of the wine and beers we'd brought, the food started coming. Alex knows what he is doing and gets it just right, serving everything family-style so there is enough for everyone to eat just enough, without getting to that uncomfortably full point. Alex came out with a candle and birthday wishes in Hungarian, and the whole restaurant sang to me. We brought a cake, and passed around the extra once our table had gotten some. You feel like you're at a big old family gathering, where you don't remember everyone's name, but you're all related, and you leave feeling warm and full of everything good!",

You definitely need to call to make a reservation as there is limited seating and food but am not sure of how things are noted - there was a mix up with mine where when I called we were bundled with a birthday party but he couldn't remember when we got there but nonetheless he didn't want to turn us away so squeezed us in the corner in the back room. The decor fits the restaurant - I think we sat next to a mirror and record player... The food as others reviewers said was non stop and does consist of cabbage, noodles and sausage and bread. You eat out of paper plates and utensils. Bring cash and BYOB. Parking in the back across the tracks. All of it was awesome though and Alex is quite the host!!",

The food was served family style and we enjoyed a flat bread and zucchini appetizer and chicken noodle soup like my Grandma used to make it. Then cabbage and noodles, cucumber salad, sauerkraut and kielbassi, chicken paprika and a sweet bread dessert. It was a wonderful old-fashioned evening with a great homemade meal. After dinner,  Alex, the restaurant owner, sang Hungarian folk songs for us and told us stories about his life in Soviet-occupied Hungary until his family escaped when he was a teenager and his life in America. A great experience for people who love great food and a great cultural experience. I am so looking forward to returning for another culinary adventure to Hungary via Hazelwood.",

The food was just what we expected; fried bread, cabage and noodles, cabbage salad, pork and sauerkraut, chicken paprikas, chicken noodle soup, and more fried bread for desert.  Loads of paprika, dill, and caraway.  On the 2nd Friday of the month he offers a 7-8 course meal for $15 plus tip and there is usually also entertainment!  And everyone got to bring home some leftovers.  This place is best for open minded groups that want to experience something new and like to learn about other cultures.    Definately bring enough booze to keep you busy for a couple hours.  Prepare to share some wine with Alex, he prefers white and likes to give you a toast.  There are hungarian wines offered at the major spirits stores throughout the city.",

    "text": "I have to highly recommend Jozsa Corner to anyone looking for a unique and memorable dining experience.  It honestly feels like you're being invited into someone's home in Hungary to enjoy family recipes passed down from generation to generation.  The food is delicious, but the freshly baked bread was the best part of the meal.    Hungarian food has never gotten the credit it is due outside of its country of origin (try finding a Hungarian restaurant as authentic as this anywhere), and this is the best I've had in the U.S.  Alex, the owner and cook, is also an artist, with an amazing life story and he will talk your ear off about it.  On the downside, Jozca Corner suffers from a frequent Pittsburgh problem: BYOB.  It is also in an depressing area (think Post-Industrial Meltdown), and you have to make a special reservation here, since it's tiny and closes unexpectedly and periodically.  At the same time, aren't you tired of eating the same food over and over again?  Give this place a shot.",

But contrary to what most people have reviewed on the internet, I left still a little hungry. The food was good and homecooked, and I would like to learn how the cold salads were made.   I thought Alex's company might cheer up my small-portioned meal, but the house was packed that night and everyone there seemed to  solicit Alex's attention and best wishes. Jozsa's Corner is like the little diamond in the rough that everyone wants to keep for themselves and call it their own and I felt a little out of place because I wasn't raving about the food and hugging Alex while I was there.",

    "text": "I decided on Josza's corner for a big family dinner to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. She does not like going out to fancy/expensive places so, after reading the reviews and finding out that after some research on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fancestry.com&s=4ae52470034613c49740fe964b3ae6bbfc4f178d05dcc5002e8e4b4eec107052\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ancestry.com</a> she may be at least 50% Hungarian, I called Alex to make reservations for a Sunday, 12 people.  When I read the reviews, I thought that I had a good idea of what it would be like but, to be honest, I was taken aback when we arrived. To say that building was old would be the understatement of the century. My family was surprised and a little worried after seeing the outside of the building. This is not your typical chain restaurant set up. This is what I would consider authentic. If you went to visit your long lost relatives in Hungary and great grandma welcomed you to her home to serve you a big meal, this is probably what her house would look like. The fact that the restaurant shows its age and its use made it more real for me. But don't expect frills and thrills. That's the food's job.  You have to walk through the small kitchen to get to the back room where three long tables are set up. The tables are covered in plastic table cloths and there are plastic utensils and styrofoam plates in the middle. The room is filled with pictures, knick knacks and other memorabilia. Alex also turned on some authentic music for ambience. We opened the wine we brought and loosened our belts. Then the food started. Served family style. Appetizers were first. Amazing flat bread, cabbage salad and a tomato/pepper soupy concoction that blew me away. Next course: peasant soup. Think the warm, flavorful chicken soup grandma would make you from scratch when you were sick. Warms the soul. Next up: cabbage and noodles. My favorite with a few spices for a little kick on the classic. Then the entrees came. Transylvanian pork with cabbage and served with bread. Then a chicken dish with noodles. After all of the food was served, Alex came out with a plate of dessert-crepe/tortilla type bread with chocolate chips and dates. Alex then answered our questions about history and culture. All of this for 20$ a person. We added a little extra for an extra tip. All in all, my family embraced the experience and had a wonderful time leaving full, happy and with an appreciation for all the wonderful things we have today.",

    "text": "Not sure why I was banned to the \"It doesn't count \" page but I stand by my original review. I started off going to write a really bad review because I really didn't like the food. And as for atmosphere, this place is a hole in the wall, literally. There is a hole punched through the wall from the entrance (which looks like an old bar) to the room where you eat . You have to squeeze through the kitchen area also to get to the room with the tables.Our party of 3, were the only customers in the place for Saturday at lunchtime so I'm not sure if that affected the food that was served. I have to say that the bread that was served was great, chewy, crusty and warm. The second serving was a homemade chicken soup that was also great tasting but was full of bones. If you have children don't let them have the soup unless you check it first and carefully. Some of the bones were very small. The next was halushki which was ok, but very greasy. Then some kind of potato dish with paprika and vinegar.I didn't like this sour dish at all. then came pork and sauerkraut, chicken and noodles, both of which I had to ask what it was because the meat was just a condiment in these. There was no meat pieces bigger than your fingernail.Somewhere in the mix a cucumber salad was served and it was wonderful.  Nothing was served fresh, except the bread, everything was pre made and heated up for our meal.  For this meal we were charged $20 each, and mostly our food was cabbage, noodles (not homemade) and canned sauerkraut flavored with meat bits and paprika but there was lots of it. I admit that I don't know much about Hungarian food so I looked up multiple web sites  for Hungarian recipes and what was made seems authentic and I'm sure that his grandmother had to use little meat to make ends meet, but I would have liked it better    to have less food with better quality food.",

Very family friendly, and Alex told us stories of how he was a war refugee to how he started this restaurant.   On to the food...It was DELICIOUS. There were 7 courses - which were spread out very nicely. Don't expect to be in and out of this place in 30 minutes. It's an experience and is perfect to bring a large group of friends together for a cultural themed environment.

You will be seated and served a very heavy multicourse meal where the number of courses seems to vary slightly. However, I can promise that one will be noodle-based, probably with cabbage, one will be a meat stew, one will be a chicken soup, one will be a pita-like bread with a sauce to eat on it. It doesn't matter how many courses you are served, you will come away full as all-get out on delicious, heavy, buttered, carbed-out, meated-out old-school Hungarian cuisine. The plates and cups are foam and plastic. Just roll with it and enjoy one of the most unique dining experiences in the country.",

These kind of establishments are definitely disappearing as new, young, hip chefs come into town. I have nothing against the hip food scene here rising in our area. This is just not that kind of experience at all. It is stepping back a little in time and enjoying the simpler things. There were some really great stand out dishes we were served. I loved the Haluski and Goulash dish. It's one of those places that might not be around much longer with the owner's age and changing culture of our city so it's not something you should sit on if you are interested. If you want a homestyle simple cooked meal with friends and family, thrills and presentation is not important to you, and you are not afraid of old \"lived in\" kind of joints then this place might be for you.

We were started off with some homemade bread with mushrooms that was delicious and definitely got us ready for the rest of the food. The soup was hearty and delicious. I even took seconds (which in hindsight was crazy since there was so much more food!). My favorite dishes of the night had to be the cabbage and noodles which may sound crazy, but had so much flavor that I kept going back to it throughout the evening.

    "text": "Let me start by saying this place is amazing. Tucked away in an unassuming building in Hazelwood, I had no idea this place existed. Thankfully our friend set up reservations for our group, because it is by appointment only. When you first enter it is like you walked into some one's kitchen. The chef and host, Alex, then ushers you through to the backroom, which looks like a converted living room. There you spend the next several hours enjoying each others company as course after course of family style Hungarian food is brought out to you. You have no idea what you will be eating ahead of time because the menu is made up on the spot, and consists of 7 courses. If you have any dietary restrictions make sure you let Alex know when you call to make your reservations. We had 2 vegetarians in our group and they were able to eat a little more than half of what we had, including Hungarian Fire Bread, Goulash (2 kinds), Paprikash, and dessert. Some of the food was amazing, and some what just good, but the atmosphere and character of the place make up for any shortcomings you may find. Come hungry, dont expect fancy (you use styrofoam plates and cups), and bring cash because that's all they take. Also an added plus, it is BYOB.",

    "text": "I finally got the chance to be here. Maybe because I've read the reviews, so I had a low expectation about the decorations, and they're much better than I expected. After you walk in, you'll see the kitchen, which doesn't look as clean and tidy as a modern one though. The dining room is filled with three long tables.  I cannot remember the names of those dishes, but I really enjoyed the dish with pork and sauerkrauts. I reminds me what my parents used to cook at home in winter. The pasta with chicken was really tasty too.   There are two minor issues. I was okay without much meat for the dinner, but some friends would prefer to get more meat. Maybe we can talk to Alex about it if we're going to visit them again. The other problem was that because we didn't know what was coming, we couldn't decide how much to eat for different courses.   A father and his son shared the table with us. I felt bad we didn't talked with them much, since it was easy for us to speak our mother tongue instead of English. I hope the son did well in his competition. The father told us that the pasta tasted the same as his grandma's, which showed how authentic the food was.   I really like their food and we had a great time there. We ended the dinner with a friend playing the piano while others singing the song :)",

And since it's in an old house, it's a little intimidating to approach...and even when you walk in, you are smack-dab in the middle of the very small kitchen.  But...oh the smells that come from that kitchen!  Pure Hungarian Heaven!!  The dining room is a little on the crammed side and if you have a large group, expect to be bumping elbows...but, since it's all family-style, you are getting cozy anyway.    The food is extremely authentic and Alex makes you feel like you are just part of the family.  I love that the menu changes with the season and that he just cooks what he wants and you eat it or you don't...but trust me...you will want to eat it!!!!    If you are expecting a romantic fine-dining experience here...you will be disappointed. There is no sliverware (plastic is what you get)..but, you will likely become fast friends with people at other tables since everyone is in such a happy place whiel they are there.    Go with an open mind...you will enjoy it!",

    "text": "We recently visited Jozsa's Corner, and we were not disappointed.   You get a seven course meal (and most dishes will come with \"seconds\").  Don't expect anything fancy in the way of atmosphere, but you will feel \"at home,\" which is more important.  Alex is a very nice man, and an even better cook.  We started with the best bread I have ever eaten with fried mushroom garnish.  The next few courses consisted of Halushki (sp?), which was great, a Hungarian dish consisting of sauerkraut, pork, sour cream and other ingredients, Chicken Paprikash, and a cucumber salad.   Last course was a fried dough-type of dessert.  Everything was very good, and again, most dishes came with \"seconds,\" if so desired.   \"Appointments\" or \"Reservations\" are recommended.     I would have given five stars with two exceptions:  1.  I thought dessert was lacking.  Although very good.  It did not amount to much other than fried dough with strawberries placed on top.     2.  I was told on the phone $20.00 per person, and then when we were done with the meal, it was \"$25.00\" a person and it was NOT clear if that included gratuity or not.  A little \"iffy\" on details.   I did not mind paying the $25.00 if it included gratuity, but I felt a little \"blind-sided.\"    Again, would definitely recommend, but call a week or two in advance, and BYOB (including soft drinks, tea, etc.).  You are served only water.",

    "text": "This was definitely one of the most unique dining experiences I've had - it's more like going over to someone's house for a dinner party who loves to cook rather than going to a restaurant. The proprietor, Alex, is very friendly and talkative and introduces himself upon your arrival. The food is whatever he has decided to prepare for you and comes out in multiple courses served family style. There's definitely more food than can be consumed reasonably, so make sure to save room during the earlier courses for the later courses. At the end, he will provide containers to take leftovers home.  As this was my first experience with Hungarian food, I wasn't sure what to expect, so I was pleased that I enjoyed ALL of the dishes! The restaurant doesn't hold standard hours, so you need to call ahead to make a reservation. When you call, you can provide dietary restrictions, e.g. indicating that you would prefer vegetarian versions of the dishes. If you enjoy wine with dinner, make sure to BYOB. There is no corkage fee.   My only minor complaint with the setup is the waste of styrofoam dishes and plastic utensils, and the fact that it's not as nice to eat with them as compared to real dishes/utensils. Also, just set your expectations properly, don't expect a fancy set up. This is akin to eating in someone's house.",

    "text": "I want to like Jozsa Corner, but the disorganized owner makes it hard to like. He seems a lovely guy and he is running the kind of business he dreamed of running. The food is pretty darn authentic, and when a dish is a hit, it really is a hit. It tasted a lot like my Polish and Slovenian family's cooking.  The challenge comes in making reservations and restaurant planning. When we visited, he kept asking our party where the rest of us were, and complaining that we didn't tell him people weren't coming. This was pretty confusing, seeing as we had told him the exact number of people who came. The charming guy we had read about in reviews was replaced with someone who was clearly angry, and he did not even enter the dining room except to deliver more food. At the end of our meal, Alex came into the room and proceeded to berate the member of our party who made the reservation, telling him that it was very rude to lie and say more people were coming, and that he had made far too much food as a result. He went so far as to suggest we ought to pay for the extra servings. Our host tactfully asked him to go to the other room to discuss it, and the two of them were gone for some time. Eventually, they both came back in and Alex apologized. Apparently he had mistaken our party for another reservation that was twice as large coming the next day. He spent the whole night being resentful towards us for his own mistake. I am sure we would have had a lovely time should that mistake not have happened, but suffice it to say we have not come back. If you're going to go, be sure to call a couple of days before to verify that he has everything right.",

    "text": "I feel like I'll be dodging arrows on this review, but it needs to happen.  I've been wanting to try Jozsa's for almost two years after the barrage of positive vibes I've heard from multiple people.  So when we were looking for a quiet, unique and BYOB spot for Mother's Day, the perfect opportunity presented itself.  I called Alex a few weeks prior, and after an impromptu conversation about everything from my last name to his friends that were in the area, I managed to secure a reservation for 7 at 5pm.  Needless to say, I was thrilled given his hours can be inconsistent and it all depends on whether he \"has people in.\"  Driving up to Jozsa's, I had already expected it to be run-down and sketchy, but even it pushed my comfort zone a little.  After parking our car, I was completely relieved when we walked in (weren't exactly sure if we were even entering the front door) and were greeted by Alex in all of his Hungarian hospitality...  that hospitality (and perhaps his food) is about all that prevented this from being a rare 1-star review.  When I told Alex we were here for our 5pm reservation, I immediately knew something was wrong.  After confirming that we in-fact had made a reservation, Alex let us know that \"something had gone wrong\" and there were way more people than he had expected.  Peering into the dining room, I've never seen more people packed into such a small space (and I could see the discontent brewing).  As he didn't want to turn us away, they wedged a table in the corner of the kitchen semi-under the standing counter.  After wedging us in (my brother and I had to lean forward the entire meal so that we weren't hitting our heads on the counter behind us and my mother's chair was up against the front door) ANOTHER group of 5 walked in with reservations as well.  While I didn't see the aftermath of their placement, Alex mentioned he was going to squeeze them in with another table of 7 in the dining room (I honestly don't know how he did).  Finally seated, I was excited to try the food.  When I talked to Alex on the phone, he confirmed what many had told me in that it would be a multi-course Hungarian meal for $15 pp.  The courses were as follows:  1.  Mushrooms and fried dough 2.  Cabbage and noodles 3.  Pork and bread 4.  Cucumber salad 5.  Dessert (more fried dough, some nuts, and some craisins w/ powdered sugar)  While I could of passed the first course (the mushrooms were definitely from a can and the dough would of been much better if it were warm), the second and third completely reminded me of my grandmother's Polish cooking...  to die for.  After that however, the cucumber salad and dessert (if you could even call it that) were definitely a miss.  During the entire meal, Alex exhibited an almost a bi-polar personality.  With the other cook in the kitchen, he awkwardly berated her in front of us.  But while interacting directly with us, he was the sweet big old Hungarian man that I had heard so much positive praise about.  As we were getting ready to pay our bill, some of the other tables from the dining room began to leave (we'd know because my mother had to slide her chair forward to let them out every time).  It was at this point, Alex went on what I can only call a hunt for his money...  more or less interrogating everyone as they left to see if they paid and how much.  After an extremely disgruntled party left (I believe it was the 7 that got crammed with the bonus party of 5), it came our turn to pay and leave.  \"$20 plus tip please.\"  What?  So much for that $15 he mentioned on the phone (and on his menu).  I don't know if he jacked the price up for Mother's Day or what, but at this point I didn't feel like arguing in front of the family (it already had reached enough of an awkward point) so I got the cash and gave it to Alex.  As we were leaving, he pleaded us to return and kind of refused to stop talking and let us go (kind of that awkward interaction everyone has dealt with from a grandmother and grandfather in their lifetime).  Overall, we gave Jozsa's every shot to be the place we wanted it to be.  We even considered early on in the meal bringing the wife's family for another excursion at some point in the future.  I don't know if it was just a bad experience due to Mother's Day, the overbooking or both, but it was bad enough that we likely won't give Jozsa Corner another shot in the future.",

    "text": "Old world hungary meets mid century Pittsburgh via your host Alex...  He shares with you stores of how his Hungarian grandmother made the dishes and he strives to keep the dishes traditional. We learned how he keeps his crepes fluffy, and bread soft, and seasons his dishes to savory perfection.   The atmosphere is homey with embroidered Hungarian wall hangings, and old world kitchen and a Victorian couch I dubbed the \"fainting couch\" because we were all so full I was sure I needed to lay down before the last course.  The food is savory and peasant style, this means meat, sauce or juice lots of spices and egg noodles. Seems to be a balance of salty cabbage, maybe paprika and cumin, chicken and i believe beef were in the main dishes. Lots of homemade bread for dunking. A cucumber salty, almost pickled salad with dill and sour cream. Crepes and cookies for desert mm and a very sweet traditional toast to our birthday girl.  Tips: if you run out of food ask for more! he is happy to bring out more bowls full,   park around the back on the other side of train tracks, you'll see what I mean when you get there.  BYOB, red or white wine go well with these dishes.  Plan for at least two hours or three hours..... ever eaten a course meal in France? It is kind of like that, no? Then just plan for 3 hours you'll need to pace yourself and he cooks as you eat.  We paid 20$ per person, this included the tip.  Every time I had driven by this place I had thought it was closed, what a pleasant surprise to find its not!",

You sit in a family room with walls covered in old black and white hungarian photos at a table for 10, the lighting is low and the music is reminiscent of a European corner market. The table is covered in plastic and the dining wear is plastic, but the warmth of the environment, foot and Jozsa more than make up for any lack in formality.  Jozsa, the man who cooks your meal and serves you is a 70 year old Hungarian with a friendly smile and a lot of great stories to tell. The authentic and delicious tasting menu that was had by our party was 6 course meal with appetizer, soup, noodle dish, beef dish, chicken dish, and a dessert, served family style in generous portions. The drinks were byob. You get so cozy and full that it is hard to leave.  The grand total for the hospitality, unique experience and 6 all you can eat courses?  $20 with tax and gratuity including.

But the owner was extremely warm and was able to accommodate our party of ten on a weekday night. The food was honestly amazing, and you could definitely see the enthusiasm and passion that the owner had towards his culture and cooking.

This is not your average dinner. This is not your average restaurant. This is one of many reasons you should visit Pittsburgh on your next family vacation or weekend getaway. Eating at Jozsa's is a once in a lifetime experience that is not to be missed!  Imagine if you will, having dinner in your friend's living room. And your friend is Hungarian. And s/he makes the most amazing food you will ever taste. Well, you no longer have to imagine. Jozsa Corner - this Hungarian restaurant in Hazelwood is all of that and more.  While there is nothing fancy about this restaurant, in fact, you will leave wondering how on earth the city licensed this place, it will be a dinner you will talk about for years to come!  What are some of things you might enjoy? Traditional items like chicken paprikas, langos (Hungarian fried bread), kolbasz (Hungarian sausage), cucumber salad and soup. Alexander, the owner, can accommodate vegetarians if you inform him while making a reservation.   A place of this stature is not somewhere you just walk into. Reservations are hard to come by on the weekends. The weekends require six people to reserve. However, you might get lucky! We had five and were lucky enough to score one of the three shared tables with a party of seven.   BYOB. Be prepared, you most likely with be around other families drinking and many are Hungarian and they will be loud and boisterous. But that is part of the fun! As Alexander told my husband when booking his special birthday dinner there - \"Don't worry. By end of night, you be friends with everyone. You come back as whole group next time!\"  There is street parking available. Cash only. NO CREDIT OR CHECKS.",

    "text": "Thanks to another Yelper, I was able to check out Jozsa Corner during a chilly Saturday night this month. We feasted, we drank, and we had an amazing night at this charming little restaurant!  Jozsa is a Hungarian family style eatery, easy to miss in Hazelwood if you're not following a GPS or aren't familiar with the area. The old building (house) they're in is unassuming; when you open the door you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the tables; and the tables are set up in a cozy arrangement that will remind you of a night at home with your loved ones.   Jozsa also requires a reservation, due to the intimate setup - but it's SO worth getting the group together for that reservation (you need 4 people on weekdays, 6 on weekends). The food is spectacular here! It wouldn't make sense for me to review every dish since the menu is constantly evolving. Rest assured: everything is homemade, served as it's ready, and is fresh and tasty beyond words. You'll be told about every dish as it comes to your table as well. Home cooked Hungarian food - what could be better?   How about enjoying six courses of home cooked Hungarian food! Seriously, come here hungry. Bring wine, too!  You'll also want to come ready to mingle, since you will likely not be the only party at the table. Also also, the owner and main cook will talk the night away between cooking and after cooking as well. He's a delight to listen to, full of stories and history.  I cannot recommend this place enough - you will have an experience unlike any other, and will bond with friends and newcomers alike over some amazing food. What could be better?",

You sit in a old dusty Hungarian Living Room with some clutter and a shelf on the wall that leans, is full of old dusty wine and beer bottles and looks like it is going to fall you the group sitting under it.  We had fun and the table of 18 next to us had fun too.  Wish someone would have played the old upright piano but no one in our group was a piano player.   You get disposable plates and with all the courses you get that is a good idea.  Alex would tell us about the food and did answer a few questions but didn't seem to want to talk this night.  Our first course of Langos with a savory mushroom and garlic sauce was great.  Other courses are pretty much the same as everyone has already written about the include Gulyas a Hungarian Beef Goulash, Halushka, braided bread, Chicken Paprikash, and to end the meal we received a some Langos with warm chocolate and powdered sugar.  Most of the courses had a heavy hand of Hungarian Paprika and a couple of people in our group mentioned that most the food tasted the same due to that.",

It seemed like he inadvertently overbooked, and so it was very cramped, and there wasn't enough food to go around. In my previous experience there, the owner was personable and explained each course while he served it. This time there was very little explanation, and if you asked him a question, he would bark at you in response.   We were also there for over four hours, with up to an hour in between certain courses. It was just way too long. And for the price of $32 a person, it was just too much money for the amount of food that we received.  I'm grateful for my first experience here, but after this last time, I will not  be returning.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Jozsa Corner ever since 2006, when it was featured by Rick Sebak on WQED's \"What Makes Pittsburgh Pittsburgh?\"  It was also recently featured when Anthony Bourdain filmed an episode of  \"Parts Unknown,\" in Pittsburgh, which re-sparked my interest in wanting to dine here.  First of all, this really isn't just a meal in a restaurant, it's more like a cultural experience that you share family-style, while sitting at a folding table in your grandparent's living room with relatives (some of them may be long-lost cousins that you only met that night).   The whole experience lasted well over two hours, and included several courses of traditional Hungarian dishes to include, a fried bread called Langos, served with a side of Mushrooms & Garlic for topping the bread, Hungarian Beef Goulash (Gulyas), Halushka (cabbage and noodles), Transylvanian Gulyas (made with pork and sauerkraut), served with freshly baked loaves of braided peasant bread, Chicken Paprikash, Dilled Cucumber Salad with sour creme.  At the end of the meal, a tray of sweets was passed around, to include a piece of cooked dough w/powdered sugar, along with dried apricots, chocolate, and some other fruits.  In-between courses we were treated to stories and songs from Hungary, it was a really great evening.  Alex is a wonderful host, and I highly recommend coming here it if you ever get the chance.  This place has been serving food since 1988, and is celebrating 30 years of business in 2018, and there is a reason for the longevity, and it is Alex's love and passion for Hungarian food and culture.  He made us feel like we were part of the family.  And I also wish to extend a BIG THANKS to David B., for organizing our group and making the reservations.  It was an AWESOME experience. Cheers!",

    "text": "I stopped by here in January with my wife and a group of other Elite Yelpers for dinner.  My wife and I had found out about Josza's Corner from a friend and I have had it bookmarked in Yelp ever since.  However due to its location and reservation policy (4 or more on weeknights and 6 or more on weekend) we never made it there.  Thankfully Anthony Bourdains show made it popular again and luckily for me fellow elite David B organized a community Yelp meet up for us here.  As many others have noted this place isn't much to look at from the outside.  My wife and I actually had a difficult time figuring out what door to go through.  We chose the right one and ended up in the kitchen area where Alex, the owner, was using a mixer to make bread.  We proceeded to squeeze through a small opening and headed to the back room where dinner was to be served.  On the night that we visited there was also a group for a birthday celebration with who we ended up splitting a large table and all of the family style entrees.  It was sort of weird but also sort of fun.  As for the \"dining room\" itself, it consisted of a two large tables and then a lot of chacthke.  To me it felt like we were in a large room at my Grandparents house with how crowded it was as well as with all the random stuff that was around.  For dinner on this evening we had a number of traditional Hungarian dishes.  To start off we had a fried flatbread called Langos which was served with a side of Mushroom paprikash to dress the bread.  While both were great I actually enjoyed the bread on its own and could have eaten a ton of it by itself.  After we had finished with that our next dish was Hungarian Beef Goulash.  That was followed by dishes of Haluski and then Transylvanian Goulash.  As you would expect all of those were good and my favorite of the bunch was the Transylvanian goulash which was made with pork and sauerkraut and served with freshly baked loaves of braided peasant bread.  Interestingly Alex had one of the diners cut the bread and had to teach him how to do it as they were still warm and would rip if done improperly.  Finally to finish off the main courses is arguably the most common of Hungarian dishes in Chicken Paprikash.  It was served with a Dill Cucumber Salad and was delicious.  At the end of the meal a simple dessert in the form of a tray of dried apricots, chocolate chips and some fried dough was passed around.  At this point Alex came back to the dining area to talk with us and boy could he talk.  He was a fantastic storyteller and at the cajoling of David B sang some folk songs for us as well.  It was definitely an interesting but good way to end what was a good experience.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Yes it's definitely an unusual experience but a good one at that.  It was actually good enough that my wife and I are working on trying to get a group of friends together so that we can head back.",

And we weigh in, maybe we say it is not worth it and pass, and sometimes we just plunge in, enjoy good and deal with bad later.  Jozsa Corner is that kind of restaurant that will give you so much pleasure but also give you some reasons to think about what you just did.  My rating is 4 stars for the overall experience and food quality. It is definitely an adventure, starting from the location in Hazelwood, an old building with the sign, \"Traditional and Improvisational Hungarian Cooking.\"  You get in, and somehow,  that old building transforms to be even older and you pass the warm kitchen while stew  in the old pots is boiling and spreading nice smell thru out the space. You are headed next to the literal a-hole-in-the-wall (see picture).  If the cleanliness is a deal breaker, this may not be place for you.  I will quote Lemony Snicket and say, \"...so if you have any sense at all you will put this book down and pick up another one.\"  Nothing is sparkling clean in Jozsa Corner and the toilet is the worst toilet ever - you have to go to a basement, pass some pipes and close the flimsy door that leaves an inch of space between your privacy and the rest of the world. There's no menu; the owner just starts bringing out dishes,\" I have to say that all food was exceptional.  You will definitely get many courses of delicious food that contains red paprika and black pepper spices.  Make sure that you get drinks with you as you tend to care less about dust when you had a couple glasses of wine with a great 6 course meal that will not disappoint. This is not a place where you would wear the high heels or a tie - but you may.  This is a place where you will experience the Hungarian adventure in the communal dining atmosphere.",

Eat Hungarian food from an older man who makes everything in said kitchen. Check. Communal dinning with strangers. Check.  It's definitely a one of a kind experience. So for $15 you get 6 courses. Yep, that's right... SIX! And seriously, all the second helpings you could ever want. They literally tell you to clear off the plate or bowl before removing it from the table!   It was a packed house, with three parties of 8-10 people, and then we were the odd \"man\" out with a party of 5. The problem was, the tables sat about 12, so we had to split up between two tables. Not necessarily ideal, but we made it work. Especially because the 2 of us who has together had a pretty fun table to converse with... I don't think that can be said for the other 3. But my only real suggestion for the place is to schedule the seating a little better.  I don't even know where to start with all the food. Some dishes were really really good, while others were just okay. Maybe I'll start with the okay. The first dish, the fried dough and mushrooms (sorry if there's a proper Hungarian name for this that I don't know) was just okay. The mushrooms tasted like they had come out of a can. Maybe they didn't, but they weren't flavored very well. The peasant soup was good. It was peppery, which I appreciate and tasted more like chicken noodle soup.  Everything else, I can say, was very tasty. I didn't realize Hungarian culture shares Haluski as a dish. I love Haluski, but think it can easily be bland. Not with this. Again, it had enough pepper and even salt to satisfy me. The sauerkraut and pork was great and the pork was very tender. I'm not even a big pork fan and thought it was good. But the thing I will remember the most is the goulash and chicken. I NEVER order chicken at restaurants. I don't like cooking it at home. I'm just not a big fan. But this was the best, most flavorful and tender chicken I've ever had. It was delicious! That is saying a lot from me, an anti-chicken gal!   It was really cool at the end because Alex, the owner and cook, came out and talked about Hungarian history. You think about how America has become such a melting pot, you don't know if you'll get this kind of experience a decade from now. It just was very heartwarming to hear him speak so passionately about Hungarian culture.",

When asked by one of our Meetup members to set this up I loved the idea of what she shared with me about the establishment. We had a group of 17 that went.  It was hard to get a hold of the owner to set it up but finally it worked out, for evening dinners you have to have a reservation.  Growing up in Pittsburgh I had many Hungarian friends and have eaten at their homes but their authentic Hungarian dishes but none tasted like these, maybe it was an off night for them. Everything was just all right.   I was fine walking through the dark kitchen that looked like it needed a good cleaning to get to the dining room. Once we entered the large room setup for two groups it was surrounded by pictures, memorabilia from a different era, a piano and it kinda made you feel like you where at someone's home, like going to grandma's, still needed a good cleaning but okay so far. The flying bugs were annoying which shouldn't of been since it was late fall / winter when we visited this establishment.   I was fine with them serving with paper plates and plasticware but Instead of the cheapest napkins, paper plates, and plasticware Alex should think of the a little sturdier plate since most of the dishes where very soupy, better napkins, and plasticware.  Especially for the price of the experience and the quality of the food there are improvements needed to be made.  It was great getting together with our group and to be able to able to talk to everyone and a bonus that someone from the other group actually played the piano. I'm glad that I went but can't say I would go back nor tell people to go but maybe you should and make up your own mind.  I'm glad that some people think is great...",

    "text": "Get your segg to Jozsa.  Proprietor Alex, a one-time teenage refugee of Soviet-occupied Hungary, is in his mid-70s. He seems healthy as an ox, and his cooking says he hasn't lost a step, but this is a one-man labor of love that surely won't last forever. Jozsa Corner offers a very affordable and delicious culinary tour of Hungary. Family-style eating. Exactly one million courses with bottomless bowls. (The bowl is the only thing that's bottomless at the end of the meal.) Our feast included haluska, paprikas, gulyas, and chicken soup. Yours may be slightly different, but the theme will be about the same, everything seasoned beautifully.  Every second Friday of each month is \"Hungarian Night\", distinguished by the fact that it will be somewhat easier to get Alex to serenade you with Hungarian folk tunes after dessert.  Make a reservation. The house can't fit more than about 25 people. (There's no room for a dishwasher either -- all plates and bowls are styrofoam, all utensils are plastic.) He'll make vegetarian dishes if you specify in advance. BYOB.",

I'm happy to provide an honest review...not sure what kind of crack the other positive reviewers were smoking.  I knew this was a dive, hole in the wall, traditional fair type of placing going in, but certainly didn't expect what I encountered..I was attending a party or I would have ran out the door.   One positive thing, the owner Alex was nice and hospitable and trying to keep tradition alive, but nice doesn't excuse filth. Bathroom squaler. Toilet paper has 1 inch dust and dirt on it.  It's one small room with a table, family style..okay, that would be okay. Thick dust on everything, cob webs, tons of flys, hot and muggy, dusty decor, tablecloth was a $1 plastic cover that has probably been reused well over 50 times, holes, and literal dirt, hair, old food dried up..I am not exaggerating! I can't even believe they wouldn't put a clean cloth on table with a new party. The dishes were disgusting, had to clean the glasses with the pitcher of water..probably bacteria laden. I'm guessing I'll be sick tomorrow.  I personally didn't think the food was good, but not sure if maybe it was in fact traditional..but not good or worth the money. Some type of crap bread, the meat super cheap cuts, halushki okay, but hard to mess up noodles..dessert was same as app bread but with powder sugar, gross.  I feel so ripped off and pissed, I am truly the dumbass for eating here..but didn't want to be rude and leave my friends party..This place is just comical, can't even believe it is in business..no way do they pass health codes, NO WAY.  I get kitchy, I get nieche, but this is just not worth it. Trust me.",
