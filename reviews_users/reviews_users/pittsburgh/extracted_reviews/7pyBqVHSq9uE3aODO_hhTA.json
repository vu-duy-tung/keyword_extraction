If you are just looking for a quick beer, and don't mind smoke, then sure, stop in..........but not if you are looking for a decent meal.   Typical bar food with decent sandwiches. I got the Reuben and definitely had better. My love got the Turkey and Bacon club. It tasted a little better but the white bread looked like the $1 loaf you get on sale from the day old rack!   5-8 Beers on Tap. No micros.   Lets Go PENS!!!!!!",

The food is typical bar food, and you get lots of it.  Last time i had the chili cheese nachos and my wife had the chicken strips.  It was just enough that we didn't feel the need to pay the stadium prices for the hockey game.",

Ok, so the limes that were offered with the Stoli were a shocking and alarming shade of brown, but it's Pittsburgh so it's forgiven.   3 Stars for the smoke and sports memorabilia.",

The atmosphere was wild (because of the tournament), but the staff handled it with poise. The Souper Bowl was quick, friendly, and fun - essentially everything you could ask for in a sports bar. The staff handled our rowdy group of Richmonders so well that many of us came back three/four times over the course of the weekend.   If you are heading to a game at PPG, looking for solid bar food (killer wings), or just want a reasonably priced drink, this spot is for you.",

Really, you don't carry PBR!. So i get a Dr. Pepper instead. She ordered the Bacon Bleu Burger and I got the Carnivore Burger. 45 MINUTES LATER!. We get the burgers. Now I worked culinary for almost 20 years, it does not take that long even when your busy. The only positive was the burger. It was really good,  Buger topped with bacon, bbq pulled pork and American cheese. She likex her burger, which had bacon and crumble bleu cheese, except they didnt melt the cheese. And the fries had that crispy coating on them, not very got though, but edible. My 2nd refill on pop came back as root beer? Terrible service. Probably won't return.",

I'm not sure who was waiting on the other reviewers, but I guess I got the one guy who forgot he had more than one table. I was given a plastic cup of water, then had to wait around 20 minutes to be asked if I wanted anything else. I was waiting on a friend, so I decided not to get food, bad move, I sat there for another 25-30 minutes without seeing my waiter again. I tried to flag down other servers to send my waiter to my table, but they all ignored me, so I left. I get that the place was packed, I expected that, but to be flat out ignored by multiple people when you arrived at the place BEFORE it filled up is pretty ridiculous. There was another table next to me that even mentioned they had been sitting there for a long time to the same waiter and he offered no apology or reasoning. Unless you like dark, cramped bars and being ignored for 30-40 minutes at a time, I'd strongly advise against going here.",

With concession prices making me want to avoid a pricey arena meal of cheesy nachos and hot dogs, I caught sight of an establishment I've sped by on numerous occasions. Enter: The Souper Bowl.   A chalkboard sign said \"WELCOME RUSH FANS!\"  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D49q59A8OhM8&s=d7f820122c8f6764ea0e590c21befa235920e58fbf75051ece92be7ac621ccb5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=49q5...</a>  And immediately I thought I was in the rec room of a relative, one with a loving obsession for Pittsburgh sports. Framed photos and logos ornamented the deep green walls. Surrounding me in rock t-shirts were Rush fans as young as 12 and as old as 60, all of them debating the merits of various Rush albums and songs, wondering aloud what the setlist would be like, revealing what they heard would be on the setlist and etcetera, electric progressive, etcetera.  Despite the lofty music I'd be hearing that night, the food was nothing showy. Burgers, hoagies, wings, and other such barfly fare make up the menu. Without putting much thought into it, I humbly requested the Carnivore Burger. With a medium rare ground chuck patty, a pile of equally succulent pulled pork, and a lollipop BBQ sauce that made the burger a glorious, very unRush-like mess no matter which angle I attacked it from...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dpdbd9oGDWd0&s=6a08deca02bd55348a2eee8b7f484b7752f8e6fdad6b15afaa93d04a205e2bbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=pdbd...</a>  The french fries that came with it were intensely beer battered, crisp as autumn leaves, seasoned as a salt lick, and almost scalded my tongue, resulting in brief rage...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtt1ZAJ_m-sg&s=2e1386cb1324acb94553291e026d771dc1708ff441ed50dd2227454124365173\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=tt1Z...</a>  My bad habit of digging into hot food before letting it cool notwithstanding...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR_saheuIIjQ&s=c44d2c854581b2471dbcdd728407662c44cf039213b7af3efb96f073fbd24f5b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=R_sa...</a>  ...I felt I had a pleasant experience here, food and friendly service included.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7xNaqZcwQQ4&s=d3ade0787b93558c4e3d1f11a53667e1c951f46fef9740421991c4eb9bc59215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=7xNa...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_sDLCvBk_YM&s=64d8574c91aea1c747899113ccd541e5b3e798c8470bd4a32e871cfa3a1cd4f4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=_sDL...</a>  P.S.

Our waiter ShipWreck was amazing. He was funny, nice, and he made the experience more enjoyable. He did it all. The place doesn't have a hostess so he was doing it all. Bussing tables, making conversations to the 11 tables he was waiting on, taking orders, running food, grabbing beer. He rocked it. He gave us the best service I've had in a while, and he was always on the move. Every single person he waited on even left with a smile. You can tell he loves his job. If you wanna stop for GREAT FOOD, COLD BEER, and even BETTER service then check out the Souper Bowl, and ask for ShipWreck to wait on you!!",

    "text": "I hadn't been to this restaurant in years, since a. I lived out of state and b. When PA changed the laws they continued to allow smoking upstairs and I'm highly allergic. I found out they finally stopped allowing smoking anywhere inside and decided to try them again.  I attend a lot of Penguins games & concerts and normally go just down the street to eat/drink before the game with friends and family. Since I go straight from work, I'm always the first to arrive. No one else has an issue with seating me alone to wait for the rest of my party. Though the Souper Bowl was EMPTY (so empty that I was wandering around alone with no one greeting me and the next person in the restaurant thought I was the one working) at this time.   Though there was almost no one there (me and this other woman, who took a couple of menus and seated herself), when I mentioned that there were two in my party and we needed to see the Pirates game, the woman weirdly (and rudely) asked if they were THERE NOW... Um... Clearly not. She could see it was just me. I told her I could show her texts and my boyfriend was on his way. The woman next to her (older and presumably higher on the food chain) said something about me being \"that way\" already (which confused me - they were accusing ME of not really having a party of two, making it clear that if I were there alone, which I sometimes am at restaurants before shows no one else wants to attend with me - like the ballet or gymnastics) they would NOT want my business... Anyway, the second woman explained that they didn't seat until the whole party was present. (I can see why - like I said, they were PACKED... NOT.) As I started to walk away, she said they may be able to help me upstairs. No thanks. I went back down the street to The Cafe on 5th where they've never had ANY problem seating me alone (whether I'll later be a table of 2, 4, or more) and treat me very well. I don't need to pay to be treated rudely.  There was a Pirates game before the Penguins game last night, so I'm sure the Souper Bowl was completely packed. However, I attend a LOT of games and I'm just as sure that's not always the case. I'll never return. They clearly didn't care about my business that night, but I am telling all my friends and my Dad and his girlfriend attend a lot of games (and drink a lot), too. He'll stick with the Cafe on 5th, too.  No clue if the food is good or not and I don't care. I'd much rather be treated like a person the restaurant/bar would like to serve than someone they couldn't care less about. The feeling is mutual. Beware.",

Close to Consol Energy Center, fans of each school were here getting lubed up prior to the games (especially given that no alcohol is sold at NCAA events). People left and right were taking full advantage of the Happy Hour shots and Jagerbomb specials. Bar decor was nothing special--kindof felt like someone's basement--while bartenders did a good job of getting to everyone in a timely manner.  Overall, seems like a decent place to grab a beer before heading over to Consol.",

It was affordable and surprisingly filling. The fries were also way above par.   The only thing that was not so positive was the waitstaff. Although our waitress was incredibly kind, I feel as if the place itself could have used an extra couple of hands. We waited at least 10 minutes for our checks to be processed and they were done one at a time. Our waitress also forgot to bring a couple of requested items (just sauces though). We went during lunchtime at our office jobs, and there were only two or three other tables, so I feel as if service could have been a little quicker.  That aside, I would definitely recommend this place to a friend, and I, too, will be back!",

I had my doubts, seeing the space was still being set up, with some booths not even having tables and stacks of chairs by the bar. It felt a little dark and smelled just a bit smokey, and was totally deserted since it was so early. Still, the bartender/waitress greeted us and directed us immediately to a table, asking if we'd like lunch menus and tending to us as she finished moving around furniture.   Once we began to order, she immediately walked is through every detail of what we asked for. \"Let me see, so chicken, swiss-\" and on. It took a while but she made it clear she wanted us to be happy with whatever we got and that they would work with us to customize any small changes to make it better. She also offered to split our checks as she took orders, immediately clueing in to our group meet-up.   To put it briefly, our food was AMAZING. Everyone's food looked fresh and absolutely delicious. I ordered the turkey club and it was put together pristinely. Every bite was just as tasty as the last, and the fries were a great portion and super nicely crispy on the outside. Everyone at the table was just as impressed with their food, visually and taste wise.   We cleared our checks and were pretty happy with the fair prices. In the end, the quiet space was a perfect zone to chill and have a quality meal on our way to Duquesne. I don't think I'll get the chance to come back but would recommend to anyone in the city.",

They have drink specials almost all of the time when there is a game or event taking place. It's your typical Yinzer bar, which is always a good time. I see people of all ages come here and even bring their kids and families which is nice. It's nothing classy, but it's good food and a good time. I ordered the cheese fries with bacon and it's one of my favorite apps. My boyfriend ordered the chicken wrap and it was decently sized and came with fries or chips. He enjoyed it. They don't have a huge menu, but you have options of apps, soups, wraps, burgers, and salads. Our one friend ordered a burger and it was huge! Our waitress was very nice. Will be back again before a game.",

It wouldn't hurt for them to update but I guess they like the old school look. It gets packed so it's ideal to get here at the right time and snag a bar seat. For as packed as it was I did not have a problem getting a drink at all though. Drink was pretty strong and responsibly priced! We also came after the pens game for food. Food is nothing special...typical fried bar food but it's decent and perfect after a few drinks. Food is also reasonably priced. Much cheaper than what you're gonna pay in the arena. Again if you come after a game and want a table you'll need to leave the game a little early because it was also packed after. This is by no means a bar I'd come to on the reg or just hit up on a night out. I would only stop here if I was going to a game or event at ppg.",

At lunch I was able to sit downstairs and ordered the Chicken Salad which was very good. Service was pleasant and quick as well. Tonight when I went to grab my takeout, there was a sign stating the 2nd floor was open.  I figured maybe at night they open up more seating but to my surprise the downstairs was all blocked off and it said employees only.  Maybe they are renovating or something.    Upstairs was another bar and some seating. A decent little gathering of people around 7p.  I approached the bar to see where to pickup my order and the bartender said she could grab it.  Everything was ready to go in under the time the states to me so I was happy.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Diablo Style (they add banana and jalapeno peppers) along with fries and a side of blue cheese all for $10 and some change.  I could smell the buffalo sauce through the bag and container so I knew this was going to be good.  Not only was it delicious but the sandwich was huge along with a bunch of fries. Good value here.  And the chicken was and actual white chicken breast which was then breaded. You had to bite against the grain other wise you'd pull the whole thing apart. None of that imitation junk here. There is also something very appealing about their fries that I can't put my finger on.  Almost like they have a slight coating on them. I highly recommend you give this a shot the next time you are near the arena.",

It was full but not packed and more of a family atmosphere than a frat club. Not what I thought when I came in and not what I expected before a Penguins game. I was surprised and would come here again just because of the atmosphere.  The service was slow but not more than what I expected from before a game. We ordered beers and food and it did take a long time to get them, but we were in no hurry.   Sweet potato fries were a $2 upcharge with the sandwiches but totally worth it. And I got the regular fries and they were crispy and hot. Perfection.  For my lunch I ordered a Reuben. Reubens are my go to for most lunch time ventures. I love them and this one at the Souper Bowl was exceptional. The bread was toasted to perfection and the meat....it was piled on. I could not believe there was that much meat on the sandwich. I probably could have made an entire other sandwich from the meat. The sauerkraut was not overwhelming and had enough tang to get the mouth watering.  I enjoyed my time here and I look forward to coming here again!  Only question. The name...Souper Bowl. Is it a play on no one allowed to say Super Bowl? Because, they only had two soup choices! So it has to be that, right?",

I also asked to add onion and pickle to the sandwich.   When I went in to pick it up the first 2 employees I talked to had no idea where my order was. When I tracked it down, the bartender who waited on me seemed disinterested in working. I paid my $10 bill, tipped $2, and left. Should have checked my meal first, I suppose.   When I got back to work I found that the coleslaw was missing from the order. There weren't any sides included. They also didn't put the onion or pickle on the sandwich.   The worst part though was the bottom bun was soooo extremely greasy/soggy that it fell apart when I picked it up. There was basically a puddle of grease beneath the bun.   I would have given one star if the chicken and bacon hadn't been as good as they were. The chicken was cooked well, and the bacon was a decent quality.   I would not recommend Souper Bowl for food, and I won't go back.",
