Sweet potato french fries are a must for me, very good.  Living nearly across the street from Henry's, I've been quite often.    Food is hot and fresh.  Service is fast and friendly in the dining area and bar.  They have some creative dishes but they are not consistently executed.  Stick with classics and you won't be disappointed.  Fried Pierogies are very tasty with a Harp beer.",

When I made the reservations I stated we had tickets for Wicked at 7:30 and the male on the phone said that would not be a problem - he was WRONG! After finally getting John our server he took our drink and appetizer order and went to the females just sat; took their drink order - then proceeded to provide their drinks; took their dinner order THEN took care of our table! He was told that we too were going to Wicked (yep the 3 females also  told him as we could clearly hear them when they arrived that they were going to Wicked).  We told him we'd go ahead and take our salads prior to the appetizer - no protocol due to the timing of the situation; we received our food at 6:50! - he apologized for the delay - needless to say the other party had already long had their dinners and were paying their check! The food was OK; nothing to write home about - our bill for 3 people was $112 and we were treated in such a manner! We tried them because they ADVERTISE as a pre-event spot but trust me do NOT go there; you won't have time to eat and digest your food; what a disappointment with the dining experience - TOO many good places to have this type  of situation happen ever!  I tried to contact them today to let a manager know but alas he was too busy to come to the phone and their is no Contact us on their website.  Good luck to them - I plan on posting our experience and advising others to make sure they plenty of time and you are NOT going to a show. Oh and did I forget they advertised on their website the Tuesday special as $4.00 house wine; however we were charged $6.00 a glass - sad, sad series of events!",

What puts the P in Pittsburgh ! The Perogi ,the half order is enough to fill you the whole order is a sharing plate or a ticket back to your room for a NAP! They are Crisp on the outside hot moist and creamy in the middle,  ask for extra grilled Onions  and you will sure to be more than pleased.

The chicken is suppose to be topped with an Armaretto cream sauce.  What I got was about a dollop (albeit a small dollop) of a white foam.  I could not tell what flavor the foam was.  The chicken was tender and juicy... The shredded sweet potato crust was crispy and gave a good contrast to the chicken.  The steam veggies is nothing to write home about... Frozen assorted veggie steamed... I had to add salt to get flavor.  The mini baked potatoes were tender...cannot go wrong with them.  I ordered the side Caesar salad... Good croutons.  Lettuce was drowning in dressing and cheese.  Men's restroom was clean and well stocked.  There were 2 standees and 1 stall.",

It's in a prime location on Penn Avenue, close to the Convention Center, several hotels and the Cultural District. It offers a giant menu that has something for everyone and the quality of the food is darn good and at a fair price, as are the drinks. The atmosphere is comfortable and unpretentious and the service is prompt and friendly. If you find yourself in downtown wanting something other than a small plate, taco or the latest locally-sourced food craze, this place towers above the other more conventional options in the Golden Triangle.",

But I'm not a jerk so I try to be fair and helpful to the other Yelpers out there :-)  This place is a very nice watering hole, local feeling tavern/bistro with a local flavor, good food and good service.  My sweetie and I were in town (from New Orleans) with about 3,000 geezers at a woodworking symposium at the Lawrence Convention Center and stayed at the Westin.   I made reservations (I'd recommend it) for Friday at 6:30 PM.  The place was packed.  We were seated immediately.  The server arrived immediately. She was very nice, obviously experienced and efficient and helpful.    We had  a couple of appetizers:  mild wings and zucchini strips with horseradish sauce, and for meal we ended up eating pirrogies.  Yes, the appetizers were that big.  Also, we were drinking just a tad.  The margaritas passed the wife test and I'll mention the beer later.  The zucchini strips were ginormous and tasty.  Crunchy and the sauce was a good accompaniment to them.  The wings were pretty much standard Buffalo style but very good and not too hot.  The pierogies were just as good as I remember from my Chicago days, where my best friend's mom would make some when our band was practicing down in the basement. :-)  The beer \"All in Amber\" is a local brew.  It is fantastically good.  I'm a sort of beer snob but not one of those hipster wannabes, just to let you know.  But seriously, this is a smooth, rich and creamy amber with a full flavor.  Love me some Amber.  Also, if you're a beer nerd, they have Beer Nerd stats on the bottle.    Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Over the last 2 weeks, I have bussed down to Penn Avenue in the heart of what many Pittsburgher's know as 'The Cultural District' to enjoy dinner with old friends. BOTH times, the meeting spot was supposed to be Sienna Mercato.  Busy with a waiting list, we ended up landing next door for dinner at August Henry's City Saloon.    Upon entry to August Henry's, we got a seat right away.  This American pub is located between two newer restaurants that are getting a lot of buzz as Downtown Pittsburgh destinations: Ten Penny and the abovementioned Sienna Mercato.  With unique ambiance decorating both establishments, I truly believe you are paying for the name vs. the quality experience I had at August Henry's.    While dining at August Henry's, friends and I enjoyed sandwiches and salads with drinks from the bar.  On visit one, I devoured a Steelworker burger, complete with a sizable beef patty, sauteed onions and a pierogie.  As decadent as this was, I psyched myself into having a side salad with balsamic dressing in order to feel better about myself.  The second visit was equally enjoyable, as I ordered the popular Sweet Potato Chicken Salad as my entree.  It was sooooo good.  Washing this all down with Vodka and soda on a warm summer evening made for the best cocktail choice (and they have a generous pour I might add).  Even though this restaurant is not new, I had never been to it before the restaurants mentioned above along the Pittsburgh - Penn Avenue corridor.  Yes, that means August Henry might be the overflowing second choice to the newer options, but I truly did enjoy this staple and hope that it sticks around for years to come.",

He took care of us very quickly, brought our check over right away and even informed the kitchen about our rush to get to the show.   My friend and I split a Tuna Steak Burger and a Sweet Potato Chicken Salad. Both of them were good, I wish I would have had more time to enjoy the food! I was honestly still chewing when we ran out the door to the show. I didn't think the prices were too bad for the portions we received...$13 for the burger and $12 for the salad... but most of their dinner entrees ranged from $20-30.  I would definitely give this place another try when I have a little more time to savor my meal!",

    "text": "I ate here for a birthday dinner this weekend.  We did have a group of 10 which always poses a challenge.   Our server Marie was GREAT!  She handled us with ease.  The bartenders however were very slow and it took 15 minutes to fill our bar order which was 4 mixed drinks and 4 beers, pretty basic.    We ordered a bunch of apps, buffalo dip, zucchini, stuffed pretzel, and artichoke dip.  the pretzel wasn't anything to write home about, the fried zucchini was the best of the 4, the buffalo dip was good (not as good as my homemade version).  For my entree I had the sirloin steak with piergories.  It was okay, the steak was cooked prefectly, but the pierogies were awful.  That's the reason I got that entree because it came with them.  I would go back to this place for drink and app specials, ($6 Long Islands on Saturday and $6 buffalo Dip) if I wanted to catch a game, (they have a lot of TV's).",

Whatever spice they use on the Caribbean jerk is to die for, the portion is great and they are half off from 4 pm to 9 pm on wednesdays. Check the menu for each daily special, there are some good ones. Additionally, servers are friendly and accommodating, we were actually asked what we wanted to watch at the bar. On the less than positive side, the prices really are a bit steep, and there are single specials without a standard happy hour so it won't necessarily be the spot to go for a long evening of affordable food and drink. Also the mixed drink I had, the Sweet Honey Iced Tea, tasted very watered down. Overall, nice people, great wings, go on Wednesday but maybe pass on a stop here for a pregame, long night or bar crawl.",

It was done just the way I wanted it and it came out hot, which is very important to me. I also had an order of fries which were very good. My wife had a salad w/chicken in which she said was good as well. My daughter ordered a salad and chicken sandwich which she was very satisfied with. She actually couldn't eat all her sandwich because of the portion size being so big and asked for a box to take the rest home. Our server's name was Erin and she was very friendly and took her time to make sure every thing was okay. Tuesday nights was $3.00 off burgers and $3.00 off Miller lite drafts. It was very cozy w/a great atmosphere and not loud like some restaurants which means a lot to my wife and I. We were so impressed we stopped back after the concert for a couple drinks. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant if you like burgers, good food and cold drinks. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Pittsburgh again.",

We sat down and I ordered a pint of Guinness. The pint arrived seconds later. Bad omen #2. I never understand when a bartender can't pour a proper pint of Guinness.  I ordered the sweet potato crusted chicken, which sounded promising. My wife got the salmon. The salad that came with my meal was good and the croutons delicious. I could tell they were house made so I was looking forward to my main meal. Alas, It was bland as can be. The sweet potato crust was crispy for sure, but the chicken itself was dry and flavorless. It was topped with an amareto sour cream which was odd and did not compliment the dish at all. My wifes salmon was also bland.  Oh, and when we left the hostess was still texting on her phone . Don't bother going here, there are several great choices literally steps away. I shall not return.",

Beforehand I checked out the other yelp reviews and there were some pretty good ones but also some rather bad ones so I didn't know what to expect.   My experience was great though. Great food, service was perfectly fine but it was a little early that I went so not sure how it is when it picks up a bit. But the food was surprisingly good, looked like they cared about its quality to me. And there was a lot of it. Portions were great.   I saw some ppl complaining about price but what do you expect? First of all, it's way cheaper than most places on Penn. But beyond that, I thought it was priced exactly the same as other American restaurants. A burger is 12 dollars, and a specialty burger is like 15. That's not unbelievably cheap but it's not absurd.   Great place. I would definitely go back and likely will!",

    "text": "I'll likely get caned (by Bourdain?) for saying this, but sometimes the chains do it better.   Max & Erma's makes you a rather juicy, succulent burger when you order one medium-rare.   When I ordered a medium-rare burger at August Henry's, I got one that was almost well-done, and to my tastes, there's no other way to order a burger but medium-rare.   August Henry's GUS Burger, which like the restaurant itself is named after the proprietor's industrialist great-grandfather, is a smorgasbord between a halved Brioche bun. A whopping pound of aged, ground 100% Angus Reserve Steak commands center stage along with lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I customized mine with bacon, gouda, and a love-biting creole mayonnaise, none of which did much to mask the dryness of the patty.   The potato chips, cut and fried in-house, were magnificently crunchy and deftly seasoned, however. Even the best bagged \"kettle chips\" were no match for these.   Our appetizer of zucchini strips paralleled the potato chips pleasantly with their seasoning and crispness, the tart marinara and cool cream of the ranch dressing engaging in gastronomic tennis as we alternated dunking pieces of the vegetable planks in each.   Dessert was a fairly unremarkable cut of Chocolate Mousse Cake. Gorgeous to gaze upon, the confection itself lacked the decadence I'd been craving after a brutal week. While I always welcome the inherent airiness of a mousse, which in this case mortared the layers of cake together, the ganache that topped it had no panache, tasting like so much Hershey's syrup.   Furthermore, we found the service to be inattentive, impatient, and vaguely inhospitable. Our waitress recited specials to patrons other than us, requests for refilled beverages were ignored, and as the dining room became busier, the more we felt pressured to leave.    The snobby clientele also soured my overall experience. Old money? No wonder the decor was so stodgy. The upper-crust needs places in which to slum-it too, and that's fine. I just didn't appreciate our party being glared at by elderly women in Jackie O glasses and their spoiled, adolescent grandsons. Christ, now they're wearing salmon-colored shorts and capri pants in elementary school? Is Armageddon at hand?    What should I have expected considering August Henry's heritage?  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DE510Ixbv-BA&s=e14b98e23903e1bfe4cde71a1ebd721fefc4c8d9790850885549841827db0164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=E510...</a>",

August Henry's is laid out like a traditional pub, with a large bar with high-tops and a moderately-sized dining area with standard tables.  Service is extremely friendly, though not spot-on accurate.  There were 5 of us, and our orders ran the gamut of the menu, from obscenely large burgers to vegetarian dishes and salads.  The one common feature that united them all: salt.  Yes, it does seem that the kitchen knows exactly where the salt shaker is... from extremely salty fries, to extremely salty onion rings, to extremely salty chips, to an extremely salty caesar salad, everything is packed with too much salt.  Literally every person said that something on their plate was way too salty.  The food otherwise is decent, though nothing spectacular.  We had to stop our server several times to ask about items that were missing, but they were always quick to correct.  All in all, August Henry's serves serviceable, but ultimately mediocre food crusted in salt, and at fairly high prices relative to the quality of the food.  It's not bad, but it's not all that great, either...",

    "text": "I have eaten lunch at August Henry's several times while working downtown.  The food was always pretty tasty.  I never had an issue of not liking what I ate, but I seemed to always have an issue with getting my food in time to make my hour lunch break not run over.  Even going during off lunch hours (like after 2pm) we have waited 30+ minutes for our fare.  This part I have never been a fan of, especially when several times I was there with a friends and there was literally no one else in the dining area.   The servers though I have never had any particular issues with rudeness or anything, have a very lax perspective to urgency.  I went before with a friend and the bartender/waitress came over to our table about 5 minutes after we sat down for drink orders and disappeared for 25+ minutes after that.  No one at the bar, no one in the dining/bar area.  It felt odd.  When she finally came back our food was still not in sight.  We had to yell across the empty restaurant to get refills.  When she came we asked how long until or food, she said a few minutes.  When she finally did bring our food, sandwiches mind you, about 40+ minutes had passed and we needed to book it back to work.  We asked for our bill and boxes.  So there is that, I don't really recommend coming here if you are on a strict time limit. My last visit here was just for drinks.  My one friend is moving to Houston so we did one slightly crazy night bar hopping and August Henry's was second on the list due to one member of our party holding strong that they have an abundance of beers on tap.  When we got there it was pretty busy.  We luckily found a few seats at the bar and sat down.  It took a while to get anyone to wait on us.  I know it was busy but here is the weird thing.  Me and my husband order while he is getting our drinks my friends are talking about what they want.  He took my card brought our drinks and disappeared!  My other two friends sat without a drink for several minutes before he returned.  Thought that was really not cool, but whatever they weren't upset but I probably would've been if it was me.  So I guess the strangest thing about our short visit that Friday night was that the Pittsburgh Opera Performers were there doing improv opera... :/  Just as we start to drink they begin to belt out some sort of story line, I don't know what it was, it was loud and not enjoyable for me or my friends so we were one and done and onto the next place to continue our night.  I would go back to August Henry's but only if I had a lot of time and probably not for Happy Hour.",

I wanted to share that it can be tough squeezing in lunch here under the traditional 1 hour lunch window. Also anticipate the bill to be closer to $15+ per person and easily could be $20 if you do some add on's.   I went with jumbo fish sandwich and a cup of soup. The soup was a cup of clam chowder and it was \"delish!\" I could have just eaten a few bowl of that. The fish was breaded and perfectly cooked with a side of chips. I got my ever present coke w cherries added. I recommend this stop if you are lucky enough to work downtown.",

The long island ice teas served here are amazing and inexpensive. If you ask nicely, you may even get a \"to go\" cup. It certainly served us well on our walk to the casino.  This place is a highlight in the drab city that is Pitt. If I were unlucky enough to have to live in Pittsburgh, I would make this a regular spot to visit.",

For food, my husband and I couldn't resist sharing the stuffed pretzel app and it was de-lish! For our entrees I had the sweet potato-battered chicken sandwich, very good but nothing spectacular. The sweet potato fries were delicious. My husband had the fish & chips, which he claimed were \"as good as he'd ever had with an awesome dipping sauce.\"   We'd definitely come back for a casual meal next time we're in the area.",

I do love their homemade chips and can't seem to ever pass on them.   I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese.  It is served with a side of spiced mayo which is delicious.  I know alot of people order the coconut chicken salad as well.  It seems to be pretty popular.  The waitress didn't seem very pleasant but did the job she was hired to do.  The food was served timely and the drinks were never empty.  My waitress doesn't have to be my friend after my meal.  The ambience tries to resemble an old saloon but it is really just crowded and uncomfrotable.  I go to this establihsment because it is convenient to meet friends and i can usually get a table.  I would reccomend this to someone looking for a quick meal that doesn't care about service or is picky about the menu.",

    "text": "I've drank at this establishment late at night but never ordered any food. My friend was in town from Seattle and on his last day we decided to do lunch. I figured this was a perfect opportunity to check out the culinary offerings of August Henry's. The menu was available online and looked pretty decent.  We arrived and were seated and waited on by the bartender which is a pretty common practice in mid afternoon at smaller, low volume establishments. My friend ordered an \"Italian Burger\" and I ordered a double cheeseburger, cooked mid rare. My friend enjoyed his burger, however, he isn't fussy about how a burger is cooked. My burger was not cooked to the temp that I requested. It was well done and dried out. After about 10 minutes and three bites I had to flag the bartender over as she never did a check back after she delivered our food. I sent it back and received a new burger that was juicier but the juices were clear, not red. Obviously, not mid rare. The two patties were 8 oz a piece. Quite a lot of meat however by the time I got half way through the new burger, it had dried out as well. I figured that if they couldn't get it correct in two attempts that a third was a waste of time.   Overall, I found the experience to be pretty underwhelming. It's a shame because the dinner menu looks pretty robust, however, there is no way I am taking a chance on ordering a $25 piece of Ahi Tuna or a $30 filet when twice they failed to properly cook a freakin'  cheeseburger to temp. The bartender who waited on us was polite but not very personable and slightly inattentive. I took half the burger home in a box but later in the evening I just ended up throwing it away.  I honestly can't recommend this place.",

I'm not sure how many people the dining area can accommodate. The section we were in, at least, looked rather small. The food was pretty good too, although priced a bit high for my tastes.

August Henry's is simply a regular American bar-food joint. The service is very good. The decor is of a somewhat traditional motif but still inviting.  The food is consistent and well-executed. The burgers are properly cooked to order; juicy and nicely sized. You might think that getting a burger done right shouldn't be hard but it's surprising how many mid-range places can't cook exactly to order. The soups are delicious. And the croutons on the salads are fantastic. (Yes, croutons).",

So that said, 1.5 of these stars are for the fact that this was close to the Westin Hotel and was open.    The atmosphere: standard. Nothing special whatsoever. Large bar and large dining area.  Service: 1 star for the service. My waiter was very, very nice. (even though he had a strange moustache ... :-p)  Food: It's pretty standard. There is a large menu with pretty average prices. They do have some unique items, but none that I can comment on. I had the Chicken/artichoke/spinach dip with bread triangles. Pretty good, it was also half off for some reason ... making this HUGE plate only $5. I also had a 'side' caesar salad. This was VERY big for a 'side' and was only $2.99! They also have quite a few different beers on tap and in bottles.   In concluson: decent food, pretty darn good prices, great service and is open past 6pm!",

On a Friday night I went looking for a casual bar / restaurant where I could get some eats and hang out for a bit. A quick walk down the \"Strip\" offered two options: a high-end Italian place and a sports bar that looked more like a nightclub. Fail.   So we wandered over to the \"Cultural District\" where we were met with more high-end looking restaurants and this place. So we gave it a try.  It automatically gets a point just by being one of the only places open in the area. Otherwise, it didn't stand out, but also didn't offend.  The food was pretty good (I had a crabcake salad, the bf had a burger) and the prices were reasonable. Service was decent. Bar menu was fulfilling - it was even $5 martini night so I couldn't complain.   Doesn't seem like the kind of place you'd go out of your way to try, but if you're in the area it's not a bad pick out of your limited options.",

First, I find the place generally uncomfortable.  The lighting seems to have been retained from the space's former life as some kind of retail outlet.  Harsh and unpleasant.  The whole decor seems disconnected.  The drinks are okay, but the food?  What my buddy and I ate tasted like it was just delivered by Gordon's Food Service and quick-defrosted in a microwave.   Nothing fresh-made, obviously.    MY recommendation?  Walk across the street to Sonoma Grille.  Far better food and a much more comfortable environment for not a whole lot more money.",

When I first entered the building, I thought I made a mistake.  There was some kind of odor and the floors where sticky.  The place was not dirty but, I could tell it was a little older and probably needed a little more tlc.  We started our meal with the Crab Cake appetizer.  The crab cakes were more crab than cake.  The big lumps of crab were flaky and delicious.  More than half way through the appetizer, we realized there was sauce too. They were good with or without the sauce.  We both had salads with our entrees.  They have the BEST croutons I ever ate.  My mother went with the waitress's recommendation of the sweet potato chicken, it was not much to look at it when it arrived.  I decided on the Blackened Blue Burger. They seasoned the beef! It was incredible, one of the best burgers I had in a long time.  As we both remarked on how good the food was, I had to try her Sweet Potato chicken.  It was unique, flavorful and tasty.  It came with this Amaretto sauce that made it out of this world.  My opinion of this place totally changed after leaving.",

    "text": "Honestly, this place is super overrated. I've eaten here three times to give it chances, because I really wanted it to be good, but I've been let down all three times. You do not get what the prices are calling for. I've gotten the buffalo chicken salad, the steak salad, a burger and the jalapeno soft pretzels here before. The burger is truly left to be desired and the salads are sad. The burger was sloppy. Although it was big, it didn't excite my tastebuds. And the salads- they're also sloppy and the lettuce was wilted each time. The portion of salad is not very big at all, compared to other places- especially for $15. The jalapeno soft pretzels are the True star, though, as those were super tasty and bumps this up to 3 stars.",

The burgers are solid, the green bean fries are delicious, and the service is adequate.  The last time I was there, I got a burger and a glass of wine for under $24 with tip.   My friend got the fish and chips and ate every bite.  Never a disappointment.  A simple, unpretentious, tasty place to eat.",

    "text": "I didn't even want to give this place a star. We went here last winter before going to a show at The Benedum. When we first walked in, it was busy but not busy to the point that there was a waitlist or crowded. I'd say there were maybe 15 customers there at the most. Our host was nice and seated us right away. Our server started out nice but after we had ordered our drinks, she disappeared for about 15-20 minutes. When she did finally come back, she took our appetizer order and entree order. I had order a small salad that came with my meal and that came promptly. But our appetizer we had ordered took about 30-35 minutes to arrive, and it was cold. And there was also a party of 4 who were seated about 20 minutes after us, and had gotten their main courses before we did. Like I said it was busy but not overly crowded, there were still tables open. Our server didn't check on us at all, and the hostess that had seated us brought our entrees (not our server). My entree was not very good at all, I had had a chicken and pasta dish. My chicken had a funny taste to it, and I didn't like the sauce on the pasta. My boyfriend had a steak Mac and cheese dish, but he liked his. Our server was inattentive and basically disappeared our whole time. In total, we were at the restaurant almost 2 hours. Additionally, the previous table of 4 I had mentioned earlier had finished their meals and left way before we even had gotten our entrees. Since our server was MIA during 90% of our visit, I requested to talk to the manager. He was very polite and apologetic to us and listened to my complaints and respected us. He was nice enough to pay for our entire bill, including our beverages. I have read other reviews for their establishment and have seen a lot more negative reviews than positive. I would not recommend this place on account of the very poor service, with the exception of manager.",

    "text": "Had lots of fun here last Friday night. We went in late (around 10 pm?) for drinks and karaoke. The bartender was on her game and we were served promptly and generously. After a couple rounds of shots and mixed drinks we moved up to the front of the bar for karaoke. I am generally not a fan, as I have a terrible singing voice, but once others started to sing and the booze kicked in I found it highly enjoyable. We ended up singing (there were 8 of us sharing time with 2 other groups and one individual who was a regular there) for hours (like 3), and had lots of laughs.  The bar itself is dark with lots of wood; bathrooms surprisingly clean; a long bar with seating in the bar area, plus a dining room, and a full menu. We had already eaten but some of the snacky-food coming out of the kitchen looked good though I can't comment on quality or taste.  What I can say is that the folks running the joint want you to have fun and the staff seem to get that message. I recommend going on karaoke night. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as we did!",

So far so good with trying to find a place to accommodate that set of restrictions during lunch time.  Not!  We actually had success with the August Henry's City Saloon. I had heard of the place and it's not that far from my office, but I had never ventured there and neither had my lunch companions.  All three of us were starving.  Fa La La La La!  Off we go!  I ordered the Blackened Catfish Po' Boy (Fresh catfish prepared southern style, dusted with Cajun spices and pan blackened. Served on a toasted baguette with lettuce, tomato and creole mayo.  My one lunch buddy ordered the California Chicken Club (Grilled chicken breast topped with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, crisp bacon, and avocado slices on toasted Brioche bread.) and my other buddy ordered The Steel Worker burger (Signature Saloon burger topped with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and a Pittsburgh pierogie. Served on a toasted Brioche bun.) He also opted to have an egg added on top of the burger, for an added cost of $1!  We also ordered House Cut Fries and Fried Green Beans to go with our sammies.  Let me tell you something, when the food arrived, it looked like enough food for a small tribe.  The portion sizes were extremely generous and the food was very tasty.  My buddy who ordered the burger said that very few restaurants actually get a burger ordered medium rare right and August Henry's got it right.  Likewise, when ordering blackened catfish, the seasoning is usually overwhelming and the fish overcooked.   August Henry's got the catfish right!  Well-seasoned, without being overly so and moist, I was pleased with my sandwich.  Yummy!  Likewise, my buddy who ordered the California Chicken Club said that he enjoyed his sandwich.  Additionally, our waiter was extremely helpful in identifying popular menu items and Johnny On-It when it came to servicing our table.  It's not a fancy place and it's not cutting edge, but it's a nice neighborhood place where you can get a decent meal and not worry about spilling ketchup on yourself.  Excellent place for lunch.",

The menu consists of typical American bar food like burgers and sandwiches so I never really thought to stop in because there are so many other similar options downtown.   I stopped in for lunch and opted for the Sweet Potato Chicken Salad, and while the serving appeared large, I'm not sure if it really was that large, considering it only came with one piece of chicken breast. I'm perfectly ok with small portions, but I hate seeing places charge so much for a plate of lettuce. The salad was $12. Ok enough about how cheap I am and onto my tastebuds; it tasted so good! The fried sweet potato shreds added a crunchy and sweet element to the salad that I've never seen in other salads anywhere else. Such a unique flavor profile and the chicken was prepared perfectly. The flavor makes up for the price! However, was it the best salad I've ever had? No and it certainly wasn't the worst. Overall, it was decent.   When I stopped in at 11:30, the place was empty but it quickly filled up to capacity by noon so I recommend making reservations for lunch.",

We started with the Buffalo chicken dip which is so good! It was a HUGE portion So be ready to share with your whole table!! So many of the appetizers looked good. I cannot wait to go back and try the others.  For my main course I had the chicken potstickers because they are rare to find. They were yummy and so was the sauce they came with. However they were a little over fried. The fries my mom & husband both got were way too overcooked. They were beyond crispy and almost inedible. Other than that everyone really liked their meals.  I will be back again to try something different off the menu! Overall a good experience.",

    "text": "We had a terrible experience at August Henry's last night. Its a shame because they have so much potential just with location alone - they need to step it up with all of the competitors near by. Here is a list of things that were just awful.  *The drinks- I ordered a margarita, and it was not a margarita. It was orange/brown. It was so sour I could barely drink it. It was a mix of orange juice and lime juice- with a hint of tequila. With rotten fruit in it. * The service- the worst service I've ever seen! we were only the 3rd table in the place all night- and it took forever to get our drinks and food. The bartenders would not make our drinks- we watched them and the manager just sit there on their phones and talk. They would make our waitress make and get our drinks for us, but the problem was, our waitress was outside smoking cigarettes and on her cell phone right in front of our window the whole night.  * The food- cold and just not good.  We just wanted out of there, but we couldn't because nobody would even bring us our bill. We had to ask for it twice. Keep in mind we were only the 3rd table they had all night.",

    "text": "August Henry's has never really been on my radar. It's surrounded by all the super trendy Penn Ave restaurants that people are currently drooling over. So when we opted out of long waits at a few other nearby places and stopped in for a late dinner, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Pleasantly surprised. It's an old style pub and that's really the atmosphere. Plenty of TVs around the bar. They had a $6 Long Island Iced Tea special, so I jumped right on that. Unfortunately it wasn't very good. I wanted to order pierogies, but they had run out. Ended up going with the Chipotle Burger and it was on point. Actually, if I ever wanted a burger after a game, I'd probably go here again. It was just a fun atmosphere. People were drinking, laughing, and enjoying themselves.   So despite the fact that it's not utilizing the barn wood, galvanized tin, industrial interior design trends like the neighboring restaurants. The food is decent, service was good, and they have a nice drink selection. Nothing fancy, or pretentious like the surrounding options. It was simple, fun, and easy. Nice pub atmosphere.",

    "text": "BEST STEAKS, CRAB CAKES and BURGERS.  There it was - the trifecta of greatness in these three items that this establishment claimed they were BEST.   Best means no one is better. That means upscale steak spots. Mid level restaurants. The bottom dwellers. August Henry laid down the claim - and I accepted the challenge to find out the truth.  My lady and I went across the street from the Courtyard since the reviews looked ok and they had what I wanted - a steak.   We started with Makers Mark old fashioned's. Not a good start. At least they tried.   We then tried some buffalo wings as we were hungry from a long ride across the state. Average at best.  The Caesar salad that came with my meal was DRENCHED in creamy dressing. Ridiculous.   My lady had a steel city burger -cheddar, onions and mushrooms. She liked it.The accompanying onion rings were definitely frozen.   The strip steak was nothing close to the best. Reminded me of a Ponderosa steak from that bad chain that went out of business. No way was this aged. The meat was tough. Not seasoned. Bennigans or TGI Fridays do a better job and that's NOT a compliment. The baked potato was cold.  Service was fair.   Of this I am certain - I will never return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here on a Saturday night to use a coupon from the enjoy book. There were very few customers seated throughout the restaurant and only a handful sitting at the bar. I was surprised as it was the start of college football with Pitt and the Pirates playing in town.   We were seated at a high top located by the windows looking out to the street. Our waiter was serving everyone in the restaurant but was quick to take our order. They have decent Saturday specials, including $6 Long Island Ice Tea, $6 Buffalo Chicken Dip, and $5 Soft Pretzels and Cheese. We went with the soft pretzels for an appetizer and I ordered a side of honey mustard as I am not a fan of cheese. The pretzels were nice and crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and were lightly salted. The honey mustard was very thick but tasted delightful - I have a feeling it was made in house! Overall, this was a pleasant, hearty start to dinner.   For my entree I ordered a combo meal. They have 4 or 5 options that include any combination of 2 items - 1/2 sandwich, soup, or a house or caesar salad. I went with a chicken club and the house chili. The chili came out first with cheese on top. It was nicely spiced with freshly diced peppers, onions, and tomatoes mixed in. It was slightly on the greasy side but an enjoyable bite. Then, my sandwich came out. It was hardly a half a sandwich with very little chicken comparedcto amount of bread. The bread was toasted but almost too hard around the edges. The chicken was as dry as it can get. I ended up slathering extra honey mustard from the pretzels on it. There was supposed to be an avocado spread but there was very little, I could not taste it. The other 3/4 of my platter was covered with crispy, greasy housemade chips. I enjoyed them but felt my arteries clogging with each bite.   The service was decent. We were almost done with our meal before our waiter came back to check on us but in the meantime another employee had refilled our water and cleared plates when necessary. They worked as a team even though there were not mamy customers.   Price wise, the deals were good and we made out well with our coupon. However, full price prices were a bit high for the quality of the food we experienced. It wouldn't turn us away from coming downtown for a special every now and then.  Overall, this place is alright. If you are looking for average bar food, it is an ok option with city prices.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch.  I ordered the Shriracha chicken mac n' cheese bowl.  My friends ordered the pulled pork mac n' cheese bowl, the fish n chips, and a build a burger, and the pretzel breadstick appetizer.  What's Hot - Service.  Our waitress routinely checked in on us.  For my drink, I ordered a hot water with lemon (that's what happens when your cold starts developing).  My hot water came in a small coffee mug.  The waitress continually checked in on me to make sure I had enough hot water and if I needed a refill.  She said she knows the cup is small, which is why she was checking.  When we asked for hot sauce, she brought us two options- Tabasco and another brand.  She split our checks and made sure we had everything we needed.  She was very attentive and helpful.  Awesome job! - Location.  Convenient downtown location.  The layout of the restaurant is pretty nice, too.  There's a bar with big screen TVs for the sports lovers.  High tables with high chairs and regular sit down tables.  I wouldn't recommend groups larger than four, because it doesn't look like their table layouts are equipped for that.    - Menu variety.  Pretty straightforward layout- front and back page of a menu.  Not too complicated.  It looks like there's something for everyone- soups, salads, appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers.   - Quality.  The pretzel breadstick appetizer was probably the best.  Warm, soft, and chewy served with melted nacho cheese.  My mac n' cheese came with a yummy cheese bread that was freshly melted and warm.  My friends liked their dishes, as well.  No complaints.   - Price.  Reasonable prices for what you're getting.  What's Not - Location.  Parking in the area is not easy to come by, nor is it free or cheap. - Flavor/quality of food.  To be fair, it's not like the food sucked, but I've had better.  For example, my Sriracha mac n' cheese bowl wasn't spicy.  I like spicy food- hence why I specifically ordered the Sriracha mac n' cheese.  But there was barely a kick.  Additionally, I found a couple chunks/pieces of cheese in my mac n' cheese, which leads me to think that their mac n' cheese is more than likely zapped in a microwave and not necessarily anywhere near freshly made.  The food isn't bad, but I've had better.    Final Answer Would be willing to come back.  Would not be my first choice, but not bad for what you're getting.",

However, I love that I got to try things on the menu I wouldn't have tried otherwise.  My friend and I split the quesadilla and Buffalo chicken dip and they were both delicious. The Buffalo chicken dip comes with baby naan! And if you run out, they'll bring you more. The naan minis are delicious and could easily be eaten on their own. The dip and quesadilla were also very good.  Our service was AMAZING. Kristy was very helpful, and brought our drinks and food quickly. She wasn't hovering or there TOO much, but was always there when we needed her. Ask for Kristy when you go to August Henry's. She was wonderful and very friendly.  The happy hour prices are also killer. $3 drinks (including Captain and other name brands - not just well), wines (generous pours from what I saw), & beers (don't know the lists there, since I don't drink beer and didn't really pay attention). Plus, you can get happy hour prices ANYWHERE in the restaurant. We did not sit in the bar. I'll definitely go back to August Henry's. I look forward to our next visit!",

    "text": "Walking around the area, actually looking for a different restaurant but when I stopped there, they were out of the one food I wanted to order. So, not knowing where to go I continued to walk aimlessly until coming up to August Henry's Burger Bar. It has a nice exterior. When you walk in, it is a traditional bar and grill.  I was seated right away at a hightop. (It was only me.) The server brought me a menu and I ordered a beer while I looked. I was intrigued by what they called the Gus's Burger. It looked like it would be large, cost almost twice the others on the menu and came with a t-shirt. My first thought was even if I couldn't eat it all, the burger plus the t-shirt was a pretty good deal, and I would go back to Chicago with a souvenir.  Then I saw the burger in a Yelp photo. Nope. It looks like it is about 9 inches tall or perhaps more. Way too much - knowing me, I'd try to eat the whole thing and be sick the rest of the night.  I ended up getting a \"build your own\" burger and fries. The food arrived very quickly. This was probably easily 1/2 pound burger on a pretzel bun. Standard, it comes with lettuce, tomato, and onions. For extra $$ you can add other toppings. The burger was done exactly as ordered, the vegetables were fresh, the bun very good. And, the fries were hand cut and quite tasty. I should have ordered them crisp (my preference) but they were still very good.  Even though I didn't get to try the one restaurant I wanted to and I leave tomorrow afternoon so won't be able to on this visit, I'm really glad I ended up here. Kudos to the servers and the chef. Great dinner.",

It was happy hour and it was nice to have a variety of house wines and drafts on special. I ordered the chicken salad and it was fine, but nothing to stand out. Others at my table reported that the chili was just ok and the general tsos chicken sandwich fell short. Unfortunately, at cultural district prices, I expect more. Service was fine but not a place I'm in a hurry to head back to.",

I especially think their buffalo chicken dip is great and I had the \"Blackened Blue Burger\" today which was really good as well. I believe they have drink specials every day of the week (Long Island Iced Teas on Saturday - beware!). They have lots of TVs, plenty of games are always on.

    "text": "- So I have ordered lunch from here a few times while working during the week. This before I became a vegan. Friday night I was out with a few coworkers for karaoke. I didn't have much expectation that there would be anything for me to eat. To my surprise, my fiance was able to request an accommodation to the portobello burger. after explaining that I am vegan, the manager shared with me the bun was made with eggs. I thanked him for sharing that with me. After looking at my bill, I couldn't see paying $13 for the small grilled portobello, lettuce, tomato, and onion. the bartender was courteous and voided the transaction. not even 5 minutes later, the manager comes over with the plate asking what the problem was. I explained to him I did not want to pay $13 for a fraction of the sandwich. he then began to say that the meal costs $13 because it comes with things that I opted not to order. I asked him if he was getting smart with me and he screamed yes while shoving the plate in my face. my fiance and another coworker both came to defense and asked that me watch his tone. his staff then grabbed him by the arms and escorted him to the back of the restaurant while screaming that he wanted us to leave. once we got outside, a few other coworkers came to make sure we were ok and the manager came outside throwing his hands in the air as if he wanted more conflict. I admit I had to calm my fiance down as he was understandably upset with the way the manager spoke to me. I just couldn't believe someone in his position would behave that way in their place of business. needless to say, I will never go back. not even to drink socially with friends.",

While she found that it was good in the taste department, the presentation and portion size left a little to be desired. The sandwich came with the fan part of the tail shell still on. Not exactly the most appetizing way to present the dish. Also, the tail meat that was left, after removing the shell, looked puny on the bun. Definitely not worth the price.   I had the Blackened Buffalo Burger with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. No real complaints here. The burger had good flavor and was cooked as I had ordered and the fries were decent albeit a little cold, but I just didn't find anything all that outstanding about the experience.

This is VERY uncharacteristic of how I usually eat, so my dining companion and I were at a bit of a loss. Not wanting to leave the penn ave/liberty ave corridor of activity, we decided on August Henry's- pretty much based on the decor. It has this walnut wood, old timey Pittsburgh feel, kind of like the upstairs interior of the Carnegie Library meets a pub. Very neighborly, pretty cheap. This really neat old map of downtown Pittsburgh, circa 1906, hangs on the far wall. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly at a high top table,    The menu is pretty vast. Huge salad selection (a sweet potato chicken salad that looked amazing), but on this day, it had to be straight up cow for me. I ordered the Kobe beef burger, rare, with jalapenos and mozzarella cheese. There are a few interesting cheeses to choose from and the sides......try the deep fried green beans! Nice, flavorful batter, not greasy. Kinda goes against the purpose of the all mighty green bean, but hey, we were living on the edge!  The burger was HUGE and juicy perfection, buttery and delicious. I probably would have opted for the mushrooms next time though, as the jalapenos were a tad dry and not spicy? I could only shove a few of those green beans in my mouth before giving them to my pal. Yum! This place hit my craving perfectly.  It seems that this place is an awesome after work happy hour spot. Give it a try instead of the Sharp Edge up the street next time.",

The turkey burger was huge and delicious and they let you choose any two toppings ( I went with the jalapenos and white cheddar, bomb!). Perfect amount of food too. The coleslaw tasted fresh! Very tasty, overall good affordable place to stop downtown.",

    "text": "Wow, I could not have chosen a worse bar to grab an after game drink.  The bartenders were either just belligerent or incompetent. I couldn't figure out which. Maybe both. Any questions asked were returned with blank stares and irrelevant answers.  \"What kind of martinis do you make?\" Blank stare....... \"Anything.\"  Really? Couldn't name just one?  I ordered a Yuengling. Finished about a third of it and couldn't get the rest down. Flattest beer I have ever tasted. There was also a touch of bad-beer taste too. I just couldn't force myself to finish it.  So I asked for my check and settled my tab. I was in such a hurry to get out that I left my credit card behind. Now, this is completely my fault because I should have remembered. But I've never been to a place where they don't give you your card back when you have to sign the receipt. They hang onto it until you ask for it. Someone I was with noted that they did the same thing to her but she remembered to ask for it. Just weird.  So when I went back to give me my card, the incompetence continued. I explained what happened, but clearly she didn't understand. She kept searching for my name in the computer as if I still had a tab open. After I slowed down and used smaller words, she then just handed me someone else's credit card. Wow. Ridiculous.  Now I like to think I'm not one to complain about places. I understand being busy or making a mistake, but this was beyond that. I'm actually surprised to see such high reviews on this site. Maybe I caught them on a bad night, but it was bad enough that I will not return.",

It was not busy at all, and, since it was just myself, I sat at the bar.  There, I was served promptly.  For beer, I had a 20-oz. Miller Lite draft, which was the special for the Pens game that was on during that time, and that ran me $4, which is about average for Pittsburgh, I'd say.  For food, I had the Chipotle Burger, with the Saloon Chips upgraded to onion rings, and that entree was very filling but good.  Follow-up service from the bartender was frequent but not obtrusive.  I may have stayed longer, but a gaggle of very annoying women (in their twenties, probably -- y age group) came in just after I was done eating.  Apparently, it was ladies' night, but that was unadvertised.    Recommended, overall.",

Service was impossibly slow, the food nothing more than commercially prepared fare warmed or re-grilled on the premises, and even that wasn't done very well. The wait staff was uninterested in their customers and unkempt to the point of being dirty: and this from a Williamsburg, Brooklynite who knows nasty when he sees it. The menu tries to be everything to everybody, and as a result the restaurant produces an incredibly poor product. My biggest mistake was eating what was served instead of leaving.

I feel like if I'm going to meet friends at a bar/restaurant I want it to have something to it and this place is rather dull. Although they do have free wings on Friday during happy hour while they last. They're not the best wings, but it's free, what do you expect?!?!   When we went there our waitress seemed new and super attentive but not in a good way. It was fine in the beginning but since we were there for a couple hours it became amusing and then quickly turned to annoyance.

    "text": "Sadly, another case of bad service happened again!  And all I really wanted to do was enjoy my Furry watching!  Furry what, you say?  The annual Anthrocon aka Furry Convention that happens every June at the David L Lawrence Convention Center.  People dress up, in costume....as animals.  Enough said.  So to take in the primal action I had my sights set on a front row furry watching table near the window.  We sat down and our server came around to ask for our drink order.  We weren't sure what we wanted, so we said we needed a sec.  After about 15 minutes we're looking around for him and he's nowhere to be found.  Finally, he reappears and says he has a family emergency and someone else would be taking over.  Fair enough.    So we order our meals from the new chick.  I got the Coconut Chicken Salad which actually turned out to be decent!  Nice and crisp coconut exterior and moist chicken inside.  There was a good amount of chicken but I think I would have preferred a little more lettuce and veggies.  I just felt as if the salad needed a touch more.  But the most important part, the chicken, was great!  So we get ready to pay, there's 8 of us, and we're not allowed to get split checks because they want to include gratuity.  I've worked as a waitress before, so I'm understanding on whatever they need to do.  Obviously it does get a little confusing on both ends when you have 8 people paying at once with different cards and cash.    We set aside a $20 from someones payment inside the payment sleeve.  She came back, exchanged payment from someone else, fiddled with the payment sleeve and left.  Somehow, that $20 in the payment sleeve disappeared.  We thought she must have accidentally put the $20 with her other tips, that's the only place it would have went because it wasn't on the floor.  We checked multiple times.  Only way it would have disappeared was when she was collecting money.  Again, I know how it is collecting a billion different forms of payment, so these things easily happened.    In the end she told us she would just put in one of the orders as a \"walk out,\" which was nice of her.  But when we asked if she could add up all her checks for the day to see if she had the extra money, she wouldn't do it.  It obviously worked out for us because we didn't have to pay extra and perhaps for her too because she's potentially got $20 extra bucks now!  PLUS, we had some prime furry watching action, so I can't complain too much!!",

I was pretty surprised by the selection and size of the menu...this isn't your average bar menu.  Being a fish sandwich snob, I ordered their \"Pittsburgh Jumbo Fish\" with a side of fries.  I was not prepared for just how \"jumbo\" it was!  It was enormous, cooked perfectly, and was hands down one of the best fish sandwiches I've had in a long time.    In addition to a delicious lunch, the server, Shannon, was about as pleasant and welcoming as I've ever had in any setting.  She was very attentive, despite being fairly busy, and none of our drinks were ever empty.  She even noticed when I had use all of the tartar sauce that came with my sandwich and came over to see if I needed more.

The ambience holds it back a bit, as it just looks like a bit of a dive bar and is competing with several very nice restaurants in the same area.  From my one visit, I would say that the food exceeds expectations.  I had a Tuna Steak Salad.  Tuna was blackened with cajun seasoning and was very tasty!  Came with a wasabi flavored dressing, cranberries and almonds.  Not what I'd expect just looking at the inside of the pub.  Service, as a few people have posted, can be a bit slow but they seemed short staffed (vs. the servers not caring or being lazy).  It feels like more of a local hangout for guys (very few single people or couples...mostly groups of guys).  One lone woman got hit on quite a few times.  I'll probably go back as there were a few other menu items that sounded good...again, a better selection than what I'd expect just looking in.",

But the service makes it pretty awful.  I was staying at the Courtyard across the street on a recent visit to Pittsburgh and my brother and I ventured over to August Henry's to grab a drink and a snack as we prepared to do some bar/happy hour hopping.  It was about 3 pm on a Saturday.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  There were 2 other people at the bar, both drinking beers.  After we sat down, someone, who I assumed was the bartender came over and asked if we wanted some waters while we waited.  Um, sure?  I was a little confused as I was unsure exactly what I was waiting for.  I assumed a menu.  After about 15 minutes of not another single person even looking in our direction or speaking a word to us, we left.  I'm still not entirely sure what I was supposed to be waiting for.  Some communication would have helped.  I would have considered giving it another try on Sunday during the football game, but they weren't open.    I would possibly give it another try next time I'm back in town - but only if I can't find a better option.  Sorry August Henry's - I'm still wondering what we were waiting for.",

We've been coming here for a few years now, after stumbling in randomly one night back in 2009.  First of all, they have some of the best bartenders in the city.  The drinks are always top-notch (if you're a bleu cheese fan, try their bloody mary with bleu cheese stuffed olives!), and sitting at the bar provides some good conversation and commentary.  It's a great spot to watch sports games (we had the pleasure of watching the 'Guins beat the Flyers in overtime here back in the 2009 playoffs), and you can always catch some interesting people wandering past the big front windows.  Their food is a bit on the heavy side, but as long as you plan for that in advance, it's delicious.  I recommend the chicken and artichoke spinach dip.  It's a new take on a bar-food classic, and ever so creamy.  We also like the sampler platter, since it lets you try all sorts of bar goodies.  And the zucchini strips are awesome, but, well, gigantic.  On our last visit, I got the grilled chicken salad, which was perfect in that Pittsburgh way, with crispy fries and lots of cheddar.  The burgers are also consistently good, and we seem to really have great luck with fun and friendly servers.  So, stop in here for a cocktail before the Buccos game, or catch some hockey on their bar TVs.  Either way, you'll have a great time.",

    "text": "i'd say this place is good but not great. the service was excellent, but the food left some to be desired. we ordered a chicken spinach artichoke dip that came with pita. it was alright. worth trying, not worth getting again. we also ordered loaded cheese fries (which were no longer on the menu, but they agreed to make for us anyway!) which were pretty good once you dug to the bottom to get all the cheese. for my entree i ordered a philly cheese steak... much like the dip, not bad but nothing special. the fries were good though and the prices were reasonable.",

The warmest food was my limp salad.  Better food and service at McDonald's.  When I told them they didn't even care.  Save your money order from anyone else.",

    "text": "Food was bland, and the service took longer than usual. I had the sweet potatoes chicken. Essentially it's grilled chicken (I think from a bag) covered in sweet potato shavings. Overall it was ok. The seating on the other hand was awful. Too awkward to have a conversation with the person across from you for fear of interrupting the people on either side barley elbows length away.",
