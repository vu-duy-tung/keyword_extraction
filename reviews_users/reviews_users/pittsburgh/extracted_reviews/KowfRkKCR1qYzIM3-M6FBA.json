The burger - 5 star burger on a 1 star bun. How hard is it to at least grill a kaiser bun for your awesome burgers? The fry mix was very good but came lukewarm on my basket, like they make a big batch and they sit there for a while before plating, Would have given a 4.5 rating but cant because of the cheapo bun and lukewarm limp fries. Details Bubba! And easy to fix",

    "text": "I made it to Bubba's for the first time this past Friday for lunch. I took my mom out for lunch and she was hungry for a burger so we decided to give Bubba's a try. The menu isn't huge which I feel is a plus! We were a little ahead of the lunch rush and the service was quick and very friendly. We couldn't decide between the classic burger (you just can't beat a good old fashioned burger in my book) and the Bubba burger which was smothered with fried cheddar and delicious  bacon. We decided to order both and split them. The fries are fresh cut and fried to a beautiful golden brown and both burgers were cooked exactly to order and were super juicy.  The classic was an absolute home run as far as burgers go, the bun was good but compared to the rest of the burger was sort of ordinary. The Bubba burger was not just smothered in fried cheddar it was surrounded, the cheese stuck out 2-2-1/2\" all the way around and was just awesome to eat. The meal was so good that for our Sunday date night I took my wife back to Bubba's, this time we were there for dinner. There was no wait as were probably a little late for the dinner rush, we walked right in and were able to grab a table. The server was new, she was friendly and when she didn't know something she made sure to go find out. We ordered the KCCO burger and the Hangover burger (I swapped the french toast for a regular bun) The hangover burger comes with a fried egg and bacon, covered in cheese. This burger was even juicier than the burgers from Friday the downside was the fries were just warm, with fresh cut fries all they need to be is hot and fresh. My wife's burger was excellent as well, her only complaints were that the mushrooms were flavorless and the pulled pork was lackluster. 5 stars is reserved for knockout meals that are perfect. Bubba's came close but didn't quite make it. Overall this place is awesome, the only place I've had a better burger was in Vegas at The Burger Bar.",

Well, we are very glad that we stopped in.  If you are looking for a delicious burger, this is the place.  The meat (which is a combination of brisket, prime rib and short rib) tasted fresh, flavorful and was cooked exactly as we ordered.  The fries were ok, but not great.  They were a combination of white and sweet potato but tasted a bit burnt.  As others have noted, for the quality of the burger, one would expect outstanding fries.  Nonetheless, the burger was great.  One of us had the fish sandwich, which given its size was more like a whale sandwich.  It was flaky, and tasted as fresh and delicious as the burger.  The place is just one open space with tables as well as a bar and a lot of TVs. We will certainly be back.",

My fav is the Fresh Burger with grilled onions. Love the Balsamic drizzle. Would like a little more basil. I always get the mixed fries and while I love sweet potato fries.. my preference would be that they lose the smoky taste... but I'll continue to get them. Since the burger is so juicy and messy to eat.. I've started to get the Fresh Burger Salad and it is truly awesome. Could maybe use a little more lettuce. So far I've not tasted a better, tastier burger anywhere. The service has always been very good.. with attentive servers!. I'm just afraid that if I continue to rave about it to my family and friends... there will be a longer wait time!",

The grilled zucchini appetizer was decent, but overpriced at $6.99. It's only grilled zucchini. Now I know to make it at home instead. The kids burger was average size for $5.99 and included a drink which was good. I wanted my kids to share the burger since they weren't that hungry. I asked the waitress to cut it and put it on two plates. The waitress said Bubba doesn't allow the staff to cut burgers in the back so I had to cut it myself and split it between the kids. I thought that was odd that they wouldn't just cut it in half for me. I didnt' order a beer, but their Craft beer selection was pretty impressive. The atmosphere was lacking much character. You can tell they didn't put much money in decorating or nice tables and chairs. For the prices they charge, the atmosphere should be nicer. I'd go to Burgatory next time over this place. Same prices, better atmosphere and better menu.",

    "text": "So been hearing about this place for quite awhile now. Finally got a chance to try it this past Saturday. Had a guys weekend planned with my buddy & my son and I told them we got to go to Bubba's!  We drive 40 minutes from the North Hills, to this place in the Bridgeville area, and it was well worth the drive!  When we arrived it's was packed, and there was a good size waiting list going, but were happy to wait to try their food. After about five minutes three spots at the bar opened up, where you can order food just as easily as at the table, so we took advantage of it and sat down and ordered our meal and some cold beers.  They had a great choice of appetizers and other things to eat, but we were there for those great burgers I had heard so much about.  My buddy got the N' Awlins Burger, which he devoured in seconds and commented that that was the best burger he'd had in a long, long time, and worth the extra cost of paying for a gourmet burger.  My son had the Bacon Ranch Burger along with Idaho fresh cut, thin fries with ranch powder, and loved every tasty bite of his meal.  I enjoyed the amazing Bubba's Steakburger which was tender, juicy and full of flavor!  It had caramelized Portabella mushrooms & onions, lettuce & tomato, and a great special sauce. It came with a combination of fries which included both Idaho & Sweet Potato.  They were fresh, and very good.  Bubba's has a great selection of craft & brand beers, as well as a couple of nice draft beers on tap.  I enjoyed a nice Oktoberfest draft beer with my meal.  Our bartender/server, Tina, was friendly and helpful with a very pleasant smile.  She loves working there, and is a great complement to the establishment.  It was nice to see Bubba working the kitchen window and delivering our orders. You can tell he loves what he does, and his big smile & personality shows it!!   Got a chance to talk to Bubba for a couple minutes and shared with him my idea for a great burger for this time of year, the \"Zombie Burger\"!  Bubba said he loved the concept, and would put it on the menu soon. Told me to bring my wife & son down soon for a couple Zombie Burgers on the house, as his way of saying thanks for sharing.  Bubba's creativity, enthusiasm & energy is what makes me know this place will continue to be successful for a long, long time to come. We begged him to open a second Bubba's in the North Hills of Pittsburgh, and told him he would kill it there too!  Till that day comes.... we will be back here to this location to enjoy more delicious, gourmet burgers & fries, and look forward to trying some of the other items on their menu including both the chili, and wings, which I hear are fantastic too!  Thanks Bubba's for a great visit and meal.",

The \"onion strings\" (the reason I ordered the burger I did) were really chopped up onion rings (not even close to the same thing - even Red Robin can get that one right), they were out of something for the burger my boyfriend wanted, the fries had NO seasoning on them (though it's much hyped in the menu) - correction, my boyfriend found 4 in his entire plate that had a LITTLE seasoning. I didn't eat mine, but kept looking for even a speck of seasoning and found none. The service was also horrible. There are tons of better places and most bars have better food. Save yourself the trouble.  I think the people who rated this highly have never had a burger at a steak place or a really good burger place. I've been to a lot of them. The worst burger place in Vegas is better. Goto Fuddrucker's if there's one around and it's better. Perhaps those who reviewed this positively were drinking enough that they didn't really care and thought anything was amazing. I'm baffled by the high ratings.",

The chili took FOREVER to come out and when it finally came it wasn't hot but barely even warm ...the cheese ddint even melt on it. My pulled pork wasn't bad but DRENCHED in sauce which ...I mean the sauce was decent but becomes a little much when the pork is swimming in it. For the double order of fries that came with it ...wasn't that many fries which was a bummer. My wife said her burger was good and so were her fries BUT she wanted a side of ranch which the waitress brought......Then we were charged 0.75 for it on the bill.....and there was NEVER a mention of it when we asked for it or anything ...WTF??????????????

She was too busy to greet me.  I sat at bar unwanted on for 5 minutes.  She looked up at me and said I will be with you in a minute as she was adding up some old checks.  Finally came over and took my order and got me a beer.  A half hour later I asked where my food was and she said it's coming soon.  I told her to forget it and I will pay for my beer.   She overcharged me for my beer and I complained about wasting over a half hour of my life as I retrieved my change.  I told her she should be ashamed of herself for letting a customer sit so long unattended and that I will never be back.  Her answer?  Told me to go F myself!  I never  cussed at her just told her how I felt in clean words.   Funny, the other waitress told me as I was leaving she didn't blame me.  Never again!   Never ever!",

Once the food came, the \"medium\" cooked steak was very well done, all our fries were all still freezing cold, the little ones grilled cheese was delayed yet AGAIN because it was burnt...and the one they brought was black too. You would think they would try to make good with this horrid situation by refunding at least one meal, NOPE!!

    "text": "The first thing I need to say is that this was the best service we've received in a long while! The server struck just the right balance between informative and personal, not overbearing or cocky.   The menu contains several burger concoctions that are everything from a classic patty, cheese, and lettuce to the Fun Guy with portabellas. They're not crazy, but they're good!  We split was was closest to the BBQ bacon cheeseburger from Benjamin's so that we could compare. Unfortunately, there was really no comparison. Bubba's is good quality meat, but with very little seasoning. I'm also realizing as of late that putting fried onions on a burger, while tasty, is just a way to add more salt and mask the True flavors of the sandwich. I did like the combination of fried onions with fresh onions, though. The sauce was where the line was drawn between the two burgers. Bubba's is a simple sauce, tasting a good bit like Sweet Baby Rays. Lastly, although the burger was cooked to preference, the bun didn't hold up against the juices. Had to go to fork halfway through.   So, my simple palette was very pleased, but this burger took second place (really, third place because Fat Heads remains #1).   The French fry mix of Idaho and sweet potato was yummy, but the texture of the fries was more chewy than crispy. Not a bad thing, if you're into that. They use (I think) the salt/sugar seasoning that more places are getting into.  They have an eclectic bottle selection, and I would encourage them to increase their draft selection to more than two taps.   The happy hour specials look really fun, especially Wednesday ladies night!  We may return, but only for a special.",

You can get sweet potato fries, regular or mixed. My husband tried the regular and I tried their sweet potato fries and we can confidently say they are both equally disgusting. For the two reasons that would make anyone cringe.. They were soggy AND cold...  The server was pretty stoic and uninterested. The atmosphere is lack luster.

    "text": "On a fun-filled Saturday during my own personal burger weekend, my friend and I decided  that we had time to check out Bubba's for possible takeout after drooling over the menu (even though we had already hit up two other burger hot spots earlier in the day).    The location in a strip mall is odd.  Which kind of goes with the decor.  The bar makes sense, but there is no buffer between the bar and the tables in the dining area.  It seems a bit awkward and random.    Since we decided on takeout, we sat at the bar to enjoy a beer while we waited.  Our bartender was very attentive and was eager to explain the menu.  They really hype the freshness here and pride themselves on not having a freezer.  I decided on the Bubba Burgher with fries, my friend on the Fresh Burgher with grilled zucchini.    I agree with many reviewers about the buns.  Bubba's is serving up some gourmet meat on some cheap buns that just aren't up to the task of containing these delicious burgers.  It seems a shame.  I ended up discarding most of the bun and just eating my Bubba Burgher with a knife and fork.  I did enjoy my mix of fries but that grilled zucchini my friend got was amazing.  Both of these items seem to be of some debate with other reviewers, but ours, even eaten later as takeout, were still good.  I'm currently giving Bubba's a solid 3 stars.  It was a tough decision on what to order the first time which only means I'll have to go back to try something else.  I'm hoping I'll be able to improve my rating with a return visit.",

Also, when I got the bill I was pleasantly surprised by the price, around  $5. I'm accustomed to paying twice that. My wife and I both ordered burgers and liked them. Mine was a bit overcooked for my taste, but I should have ordered it medium instead of medium well. I'll take the blame for that. They took some time to come out. Not sure if it just took that long to cook or they sat for a while as the fries were not really hot. Overall it was an enjoyable meal, even though I gave it three stars.

My husband and I became hungry on our way home and was told about Bubba's so we stopped in to have a wee nosh for lunch. It was still quite early as they had just opened so it was pretty quiet which was fine by us. There were four TVs in front of us that had the Olympics on. We ordered our burgers. (I had the New Orleans) and our sodas. The meat was cooked perfectly.  I asked for medium-rare and received medium rare. I also had the sweet potato fries of which were limp and on the cold side but they still tasted fantastic.  Our server was Abby  she was on top of things. She answered all our questions in a perfect manner.  We rarely go out for hamburgers and there is a chain that promotes Gourmet Burgers I won't name them yummm. But they profess to be experts but they don't even come close to Bubba's. I wish this restaurant was a little bit closer but it's worth the drive believe me. So go and see Abby and tip her well",

    "text": "It was hard to decide one star or two. The food tasted good....the waitresses lack of knowledge & lack of social skills is why I won't come back. I was excited to eat here. I have Celiac, so it's hard to eat out! I asked our waitress about what I could have....she admitted she didn't know much about GF, but they had gluten free buns. And any of the burgers could be made gluten free. So I kinda thought she would ask if any apps. or something else was gluten free, but she didn't care enough to ask. So I went with a burger & zuchinni fries. The food tasted good. But when I got a closer look at my bun, it was charred black. Now the waitress said ahead of time....it will be toasted. So when I politely said \"uh it's not a big deal, but this is really burnt bad. For $2 extra for the bun that's not right.\" So she got pissed off & said \"I told you it would be toasted\" then walked away. I didn't want to cause a scene, I had my kid with me.....but I know what toasted is & this was closer to hockey puck. Her attitude was worse than the bun. If they are an allergy friendly place, then she should also be more informed or what people can or can't have. I did get my $2 back.....she said something pissy to me I didn't quite catch & tossed the check towards me. Like an idiot I left a decent tip. My mistake!",

Burger was cooked just the way I like it. Their French fries are different from most places. Regular fries are mixed with sweet potato fries. It sounds iffy, but it's super good. I asked for ranch as a dipping sauce for the fries, and was charged an additional 75 cents. That's the only reason they don't get five stars from me.",

Had the N'awlins burger last time I was in and it was perfect, just the right amount of spice and a wonderful mix of flavors. Bubbas is, hands down, the best place to get a burger in this area.  The French fry/sweet potato mix is good and it's nice that you have the option of getting one or the other. I have also had their grilled zucchini appetizer before and recommend it highly, as it's delicious. This place does get very crowded at times, so you're best option is to hit it during off hours or place a takeout order.",

As if this isn't enough, they then add some of the best pulled pork I've ever had to it. Enough fell out when I picked it up to feed somebody. DELICIOUS!!!

The kids all found specialty burgers that they loved, and the staff handled our large party with poise and grace. Most restaurants balk at a large group of teenagers, but not your staff.

    "text": "Must preface this with I tried to send this via \"contact\" on their website several times with no indication it went through.  So here goes...  Bubba... Don't know where to start but I feel you need the feedback so here goes.  This is the second Friday in a row we have visited your Southpointe location.  The first week our intentions were purely to grab a few drinks prior to a game we were attending next door.  After a lengthy wait along the \"wall\" overlooking the ice, we were approached by a waitress who took our order with the understanding we were in a bit of a hurry.  Interesting enough, we received our bill before we received our drinks that arrived 15 minutes later.  While you were \"busy\" I would not have said you were overwhelmed.  We made it to our game a bit late.  It took us thirty minutes in all to get a drink once we were on the wall.   Tonight, we arrived well before our 9 o'clock start with hopes that our dining experience would better.  I am sad to tell you it was actually worse.  After being seated, it took us nearly 25 minutes to get a drink, including the waters we ordered.  From there, our food order was delayed significantly causing us to be late once again for our intended game next door.  We were made aware of a large party only after we waited for about 45 minutes longer and watched meal after meal being delivered.  We ordered chicken nachos for God's sake... And they arrived like fajitas.  There were three large chunks of chicken breast on top of the nachos that I had to dice into bite size pieces to make them edible.  The quality of the food was good.  The service from start to finish was bad, two weeks in a row.  There are competing businesses just a short drive up the hill that we intend to patronize given our past two experiences.  While every \"new\" place has its growing pains, I would have expected a seasoned business to be more prepared for a cliental that you would hope to win over.  You were there running food... quicker than you servants I must admit.  But as the face of the business, perhaps you should be spending more time preparing the raw employees you have in customer service. Truly hope you view this feedback as a gift... did not want to put it out on Yelp as we have had many dinners at your Bridgeville location and have been fond of the food quality.",

Everything from the food to the employees had surpassed my expectations.  We started out lunch with the Fried Pickles, which were excellent!  I then accidentally spilled two glasses of water all of the table and floor.  The staff were so kind and helpful to have everything cleaned up.  I felt awful but they continued to reassure me that this was not an issue, nor the first or last time that this would probably happen.    I ordered the N'Awlins burger, after changing my mind about 5-6 times prior to ordering.  I was very pleased wit my choice.  The chipotle mayo mixed with the bleu cheese was perfection!    I will definitely be making another trip out to this location and will definitely recommend it to anyone looking to try something new!  Thanks for everything!!!",

I can't say the the wait staff was bad, just overwhelmed with no direction. I would have had more than two beers if I could have gotten ahold of the waitress. There is no management here at all and it's obvious. The place is also cold and dirty.    The grilled zucchini was good, but took forever to get. The burgers not good, overcooked and dry. They also changed the buns for the worst not to mention they were cold like they just pulled them in the back door from the cold January night it was.   Sad to say we won't be back. There are just too many other burger places around with better food, atmosphere and attentiveness for the same price.  Adios Muchachos!",

The hot sauce was good. Different but good. It was more on the pepper spicy side than butter/buffalo tang.    The burger itself was really good and cooked as ordered.

It was greasy,  but cooked to my specifications. The fries where not cooked right. It was like they where added to the grease when the grease wasn't hot enough yet, a case of soggy fries.  I stopped in again, but just to have a beer because traffic was so bad. I won't eat here unless some else would pay for it.",

Her and the server who were working were keeping busy cleaning and making sure everything was neat and clean. They both were sociable and had nice, appropriate conversation with us and the other two guests at the bar.  We had buffalo chicken dip as an app, was very tasty! But the pita chips seemed over cooked and/or too greasy. But the dip itself was one of the best around! No gross canned chicken!!! I had the buffalo chicken salad in a wrap and even had it blackened, YUM! It was so perfect I was so full but I just had to finish it. The quality of the chicken really shined through and made it even better -- I couldn't have left any happier!  My fiance had Wild, Wild West burger with fries. The fries  were fried perfectly. He was not overly crazy about the burger, he said the bottom bun was soggy from the grease and BBQ sauce.  Overall, I enjoyed it all and would recommend and/or go back to try more!",

One hour from when I sat down the food finally appeared, after I had to ask about how much longer. There were 2 other people waiting on food and a total of 15 people in the restaurant (all had their food & were there longer than I was). The Buf Chick dip came out in a small styrofoam container...cold & in a chunk (the bartender said they were out of dishes & \"yeah that doesn't look like the normal dip\") the \"Cajun burger did not have any seasoning or bacon as listed on the menu of how the burger was supposed to have come (the bartender took the menu back to the cook and was at a loss of words at how bad the meal was sent out for her to deliver) there were about 20 under cooked fries to accompany the poorly made burger. Here's what the bacon looked like when the bartender brought it to try & make the burger what I ordered & asked if she could bring some seasoning to help the burger!! Kitchen staff needs a ton of training & HELP. I was not charged for the food, just my drink but I came there because I was hungry not because I wanted a free meal. To top it off, the bartender decided to tell the 3 new customers that came & sat at the bar about my bad food which made them ask me \"how bad was it\".",

It took at least 15 minutes for us to get our first drink. We ordered food, which included buffalo chicken dip, pretzels and large baskets of fries. The chips were stale, so we asked for new ones. The girl told us they would make new ones. She brought us 4 paper plates and said that they were out of plates because nobody ordered them. I understand having an error with ordering, but how about bringing us something else to eat off of???  The large baskets of fries were a joke. They probably equaled 2 small potatoes.  The waitress said nothing when we asked why the baskets were so small. She didn't even look at glasses to see if anyone needed a refill. One of my friends actually had to wave her hands to get a drink. And again, we were the only table in the restaurant.  I'm guessing they are putting all of their efforts into the Southepointe location and closing this one, because I cant imagine anyone who wanted to stay in business would allow this to happen. Don't waste you time. The food is good, but the service is horrible and the portions are not worth the cost.",

The place itself is smaller than it looks from the outside, so I would bet it gets packed fairly quickly.  We ordered two \"gourmet\" burgers, kids boneless wings, kids cheeseburger and kids hotdog. All three burgers were over cooked (well well done)after being ordered medium, minus the kids burger which was ordered at medium well. The hotdog was scorched, which we did return and get taken off the bill.  I think the grill was just too hot or the beef was 90/10 instead of 80/20. The service was ok, pretty average.  This place has potential to be very good because the bacon ranch sauce on my burger was awesome. The cook might need a refresher on cook temps and doneness. Max and Ermas and Burgatory are a consistent choice, maybe we'll try bubbas again. sometime.",

We have come here with large groups plenty of times and they are always accommodating. Also, in the summer you can play volleyball and horseshoe which is a plus. I do have one complaint though and that is that they place a hold on your card when you run a tab. They place a 50 dollar hold on your card on top of your final bill that does not come off for a few days. It is very inconvenient and alarming for someone who isn't aware so just keep that in mind.",

We placed our order and the server came back later to explain the process of their meats. They told us about the blend of different cuts ground daily so it's fresh. Having known that, I would have ordered a regular burger instead of the mushroom burger. Thankfully, my friend happily offered to share and we split our burgers.   We started off with fried pickles and grilled zucchini. Zucchini was cooked and seasoned well. I expected to pickles to be slices but they were spears. Most fried pickle spears that I have tried were too heavy on the pickle and light on the batter but this was perfectly balanced.   My Mushroom burger was delish! We also had the Bubba's burger and the Garlic Roasted Burger. I'm so glad I stuck with the mushroom! It was a big piece of portobello and cooked really well! Bubba's burger was also tasty with the fried cheese they piled on! I love that they give you half regular fries and half sweet potato fries. Sometimes, you want the best of both worlds and at Bubba's, you can have it! I will be back again!",

Tons of artery clogging burgers, some with buns, some with grilled cheese sandwiches in place of buns. Trying to make sure my cardiologist doesn't chew me a new rectum, I ordered a grilled veggie sandwich with grilled zucchini fries. Not bad, washed it down with an IPA from the beer fridge.   If in the area I'd bypass (see what I did there?) Bubba's and head on over to the Rail Yard. Better food, better atmosphere, more beer selections.",

A very juicy (although messy) burger and cooked well since I requested medium. I also got both the regular and sweet potato fries-fresh cut and delicious; my favorite kind! A few people around us got the hot wings and they looked as good as they smelled! I'll have to try those on my next visit.

It seems like they just kind of let this place go I remember when it opened it was always busy and the food was really good It's falling fast I gave it three stars because even the bartenders knew it was a mess and apologized several times It was also the funny at one point after sometime tried to order several different things on the menu and she just kept saying \"sorry\" were out of that too... The Cajun burger I had was really good tho but they need some management help   Update: So stopped back in Wednesday  Dear Bubba, Just close this place already. It's text book on how to close a place, not stocking the beer, not re ordering supplies, closing at 9 almost every night, no manager on premises and the quality is tanking. Just go ahead and put it out of its misery  So second update  I've noticed a new trend on yelp Where the company responds to make it look like they are reactive but then never really follow up. So all of you think the company helped me out or fixes the problem. But, after a month and a half after the post I haven't heard back from anyone. Too many burger places around to worry",

We both ordered the classic burger and the potato/sweet potato mix french fries.  I ordered mine medium well and it was perfect. It was flavorful with just enough chargrilled texture and taste. The size of the burger and bun seemed appropriate.  We did not feel like we over ate.  I also liked that the bun was not buttered.  Based just on the burger, we will return.   The fries were also very good. I really liked the mix offering.  I probably would have been happier with half the amount. They were so good I couldn't help but eat them all!  Oddly, the classic is not on the menu so you have to ask for it. Thankfully, another yelper mentioned the classic or I would have been struggling because I just wanted a basic burger.",

I'll start off with the pros. Bubba's has a decent space and there is a nice selection of beer, making it a great place for watching sports. The menu is also creatively written and for the most part, well executed in terms of ingredients and how they go together.   By the looks of it, Bubba's seemed like a promising burger joint. Until I took one bite of my burger and then another. Every single bite I took had at least one chunk of bone, which really ruined my appetite after finding about 10 chunks of bone. I'm willing to forgive one or two pieces of bone but it's really off putting when there is bone in every single bite. I could not finish my burger for the fear of chipping a tooth. My husband's burger was equally filled with bits of bone and neither could he finish his burger. Perhaps this is was an isolated incident. However, I don't think I'll return either way, in the event this is the norm.",

I walk in to someone at the bar yelling - sit wherever you want.  I stated I had a party of 5 - they told me to go ahead and move tables.  What if I would have gotten hurt?  Anyways - I moved the tables as the waitress stood tapping her foot with our menus waiting for me to finish.  The rest of the party arrives - we get a long introduction by one waitress telling us another girl is training and will be waiting on us.  The girl in training comes over - and we ask for a couple minutes before we place our order  A couple minutes turn into 20 minutes.  20 minutes of us sitting with our menus closed - waiting.  The 3 waitresses on duty were too busy drinking their monster drinks, gossiping at the bar to wait on us.  The tables around us - who came in after us (after the entire group was there) - had their food before we could even place an order.  If they were actually working instead of gossiping - it may have gone smoother.  I wish i could say it got better once our food came.  But it continued to go down hill.  Between the 4 times they had to check our coupon from Yelp for checking in...to the multiple times we were told our drinks would be refilled and never were.    It took almost 2 hours from the time the whole party arrived to the time we left for a meal that should have taken an hour - at most.  They weren't busy - so that is definitely not an excuse.    The restaurant has promise - but has SO many things they need to improve before that can happen.  By the looks of other reviews - this isn't the first complaint about the staff.    Will I be back?

We all shared an order of fried pickles and onion rings and we all really liked both. The burgers come with fresh cut fries (regular and sweet potato, or you can pick one or the other) and they were delish, especially the sweet potato fries! I tried a piece of blackened chicken from the salad and it was really really good.  The others said they loved their burgers too. So, we left very happy and with very full bellies!

Bubba's is that.   But I'm gonna share.   J and I walk in on what we would assume would be a slow Tuesday night. They were busy! But not too busy to not get our food out super fast! Shannon was right on it with making sure our burghers were perfect.   Josh got the Hangover. What on earth is that!? Where does someone come up with the idea to put a cheeseburger on french toast!? It was like a party. In your mouth. I can't really describe it's awesome.   My burgher was the Bacon Ranch. Wowza, that was good too! I asked for it medium, and it was just that!   I'm sure we'll be back to eat the rest of the menu.   Happy Eating!",

    "text": "Started off with the grilled zucchini which wasn't bad but the experience is lessened when everything is served on Styrofoam plates.  You can't really say you are gourmet anything when you don't use regular plates and mostly disposable products.    Service was OK but Bubba, where I have an issue is when you order a burger medium and it's is served with no pink inside, that's well done.  Especially when the burger is dry.  The tomatoes in the burgher salad had no flavor either.  Looked good but they ruined the taste of the dish.  Bubba, I love your morning show, but your burger joint needs a bit more tlc to get it back up to par. Competition in the city restaurants is getting tougher and your product needs to step up a few notches.  Sorry, have to be honest.  Perhaps think about having some secret shoppers come in periodically to report back to you.",

No cheese on our nachos and unseasoned pork after they took 20 minutes, eventually our server brought 2 little cups of canned cheese (not the yummy beer cheese that used to be part of the nachos), diet instead of regular coke twice, no apologies for the nachos or extended time between nachos and burgers, charged extra for ranch dressing for our fries, finished plates/glasses never cleared from the table, and there were only 2 other tables so it's not like it was a busy time. Unfortunate!! We've always loved this restaurant.",

My personal preference is their steakhouse burger, cooked medium rare to medium.  Their burgers are juicy, very flavorful and just an overall fantastic meal.  Very low key, casual, laid back type of place for a great burger at an excellent price.  They have a fairly long and varied list, which should be enough to satisfy any carnivorous appetite.  For my taste, they have well earned their five star rating for exceptional quality, great food, excellent and friendly service at a more than fair price.  If you are in the Bridgeville area on Route 50, stop on by.  You won't be sorry.",

    "text": "My wife and I had an impromptu date night and were looking forward to a cold beer and some wings. Bubba's was having WING NIGHT. Deciding to give it a try We arrived at Bubba's and sat at the bar. The first thing we did was order a beer which was barely cool. Then we asked where the wing flavors were since their menu was lacking in most descriptions. \"We are all out of wings. We usually run out of wings at 7:30.\"  Who runs out of wings on wing night? If you know you run out your order more to stock up, right? So the bartender offered us the boneless wings ( not informing is she was going to charge us a different price). We sat and waited for 15 minutes for our food and we were the only people waiting for food. We ordered 2 flavors of wings and fries. The fries, when delivered, were soggy and unappetizing. The \"boneless\" wings were nothing more than diced chicken that was barely covered in a breading (some not at all) and then tossed in a basket of runny sauce. The sides of ranch were also runny, so much so that I swear the staff must have put water in the container and swished it around to stretch it out. I could go on. Worst meal I have had in the area, hands down. Honestly I don't even think they deserve the 1 star rating. Do not waste your time and appetite here.",

I ended up with a tiny (I'm talking TINY) crumb of batter from the onion rings on my shirt and didn't notice it right away. I did notice the grease stain that was about 3x the size of the crumb that was left after I brushed it away. We ended up boxing up the leftover onion rings and pickles, and the box was a giant greasy mess by the time we got home.   The fish was really good, though. And the burger was just okay. I ordered it medium-well and it was dry as a bone.   The four items we ordered came to $44 after a 15% tip. A bit pricey for lunch, but no big deal. The absolutely worst part has to be trying to get out of their parking lot, though. Traffic is outrageous in this part of Bridgeville.  It's obscenely loud, even for a sports bar. We could barely hear each other talk from across the table. Also, a tip for the restaurant, if you're going to have 6+ televisions on mute, you should really consider putting the closed captioning on.   I'd still recommend it, though, just because I grew up listening to John Dave Bubba Shelly every morning on B94 before school. Bubba is always there, but I've yet to see him interact with any customers. He's usually on his phone. The servers are really great, though.",

Decent, but not great beer selection, although seeing Moosehead and Magic Hat was nice.   I ordered the N'awlins Burgher, which the menu described as cajun-seasoned with chipotle mayonnaise, bleu cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The seasonings were barely noticeable, the bleu cheese had little flavor, and the buns were almost but not quite as good as week-old Town Talk sandwich bread. The burger wasn't bad, but for a supposed gourmet burger restaurant, I wanted it to be a lot better than it was.  The fresh-cut fries, however, were bad. They were colder than room temperature and relatively tasteless. Drowning them in Frank's Red Hot did little to improve them. I ate about 1/4 of them.   Overall, Bubba's was disappointing. Again, it isn't bad, and the prices are reasonable. The problem, though, is that there are many, many other places with better burgers and significantly better fries. I don't regret eating here, but I don't need to ever go back.",

I tried the Classic burger because if you can't do a basic burger well the toppings are there just to hide that fact. I ordered my burger Medium and it came out cooked perfectly. It's nice that you have options on your side. You can get all regular French fries, all sweet potato fries, a mixture of both, or fried pickles. I went for the pickles and it was a good choice. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "On Saturday April 14th my sister and I stopped for a bite. We were seated at a dirty table and not recognized for 10 minutes. Saw a waitress cleaning an empty table and asked her if we could move there. She accommodated us. That was the best part of our dining experience. We ordered a Moscow Mule and an Old Fashioned from the drink menu. They were out of Angels Envy so we agreed to a substitute bourbon. The drink was nothing but flat club soda. They were out of Ginger Beer and couldn't make the Moscow Mule. The bartender offered to use Ginger Ale instead, but I declined and settled for a glass of wine they couldn't screw up. Mind you, it's a Saturday night and you are out of these ingredients????  Our waitress was sweet and tried to compensate, not her fault the bar wasn't stocked.... We arrived at 745PM, we got our food at 8:35PM. A table of 4 \"regular \" males arrived after us and were served there food before us. Our burgers were average, a little on the greasy side, we ordered the mixed fries and were served the regular potato fries. Bubba, stick to being a D-Jay on the radio. I'll never be back, and I would never recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "You know I love me some burgers and this has almost made the top of my list (Steer and Wheel will forever probably definitely hold that distinction).  I love that Bubba's uses fresh ingredients (they don't even have a freezer) and they take pride in what they're serving to you.  Last time I was here, I got the Fresh Burgher.  It's mozzarella, tomato, and basil with a balsamic glaze sauce.  It was almost perfect; a little more basil and it would indeed be fresh.  I've also tried their daily special, a Pittsburgher with (duh) coleslaw on it.  The burgers come with a side of mixed fries, so naturally, you have to put them on the burger.  My only \"complaint\" is that the fries have to be eaten while they're hot.  When they cool down, they're almost popcorn-like: crunchy exterior with an airy potato left on the inside, kinda like that hull-less popcorn, you know what I'm sayin'?  It really isn't a valid complaint - you have to eat your fries when they're hot...oh the horror!  The servers are friendly, the beer selection while small is a nice collection of craft beers, and they have $3 Wine and $.50 Wings on Wednesdays starting at 4pm - so naturally I have to go on a Wednesday ASAP.",

I also got the fries which are sweet potato and Russet mix with the cayenne seasoning. Burger was done just right and was very juicy. You will need a napkin, maybe 5. Next time I'm in the area, I will try the Wild Wild West.",

    "text": "I usually listen to 100.7 in the mornings, so I've been hearing about Bubba's Burghers and wanted to give it a try. We also discovered that Wednesdays are $3 wine night, so we were looking forward to it.  We chose a table in the corner near the restrooms, and right off the bat, my friend says, \"I smell urine.\" We hesitated, but I didn't smell anything and she said it had passed, so we decided to stay.  I'd heard that the place was more bar than restaurant, so I didn't really know what to expect. I thought it was a pretty good combination of the two. The bar and dining area are in the same room, but it isn't dark and smoky like a bar. I was a little nervous about the noise level, because a lot of reviews said that it was really noisy. There's nothing I hate more than having to shout in order to have a conversation. But this wasn't my experience at all. Even after the tables started filling up, the noise level remained low to average.  We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip and loved it. The dip is super buffalo-y and my mouth was just a tad on fire. The pitas that came with it were fried and delicious.  I had the Bacon Ranch Burger with the mixture of regular and sweet potato fries. I rather enjoyed the burger. I agreed with my friend that it was a little too well done on the outside, but I still thought it was really good. I suppose the buns are kind of lacking, but my burger didn't fall apart or anything, so I thought it was fine. And if I'm honest, I love any kind of bread. The ranch on the burger was no Denny's ranch, but was still pretty good. The regular fries were delicious, fresh cut, and similar to the Patato Patch's fries. The sweet potato fries tasted ok but weren't crispy, which is a deal breaker for me.   Friend had a plain burger, and even with ketchup, the outsided was charred too much for her liking. She only had a couple of bites, but did enjoy the fries (only regular fries for her). We had 2 or 3 glasses of wine and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  I ordered the hummus and pita to go to drop off for my mom. These pitas weren't fried but were good (again, any kind of bread). My mom said the hummus was delicious. I had a small taste, but I'm not a fan of hummus, so I can't really say whether it was good or not (I didn't vomit, if that helps).  Our server was attentive, although not super friendly. I guess that's ok since our orders were more or less correct and we didn't have to wait very long. Drinks were refilled within a reasonable time frame.  I'm going to say 4 stars overall, depsite the urine smell (hopefully the restroom just needed a good cleaning). I'd be interested in going back if I'm in the area again.  P.S. Bubba didn't seem to be there. I'm guessing it was too late in the day to catch a glimpse of Bubba. He didn't seem to be around",
