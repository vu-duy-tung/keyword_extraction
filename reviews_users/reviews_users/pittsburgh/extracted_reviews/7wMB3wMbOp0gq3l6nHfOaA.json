I saw the three star rating with proceeded with caution, but I really wanted it to impress me. I enjoy that you can pretty much \"build your own ramen\" bowl. I wanted lots of veggies and shrimp. So with that I ordered the spicy veggie bowl with shrimp. Simple, right?  It comes in a ginormous bowl that you couldn't possibly finish in one sitting. No problem, I'm okay with leftovers. Everything looked perfect. Lots of veggies, lots of noodles and fresh shrimp. But... the flavor. It was not there.   You can choose between the soy or miso based broth. Maybe that's where I went wrong. I find that sometimes I'm not into miso broth, so I went with the soy base. Was that the mistake then for real? Not sure, but what I was sure of is that it was off. It just needed some oomph.   Sad, because like I said, I really wanted it to be something. I think with my leftovers I'm going ot pepper it up (literally, with pepper) and try and spice it up a bit. Will I be back? Maybe, but I'll order something different and give it another go round.",

I've experienced better.\"   I've tried both the shoyu- and miso-based broths and each time I've left feeling unimpressed. I'd be willing to pay more for an impressive bowl of ramen, but it just seems like they're using canned chicken stock or something and adding either soy-sauce or miso, tossing in meat, noodles and whatever toppings that are requested.   The portions are huuuge. I haven't been able to finish a bowl of ramen here yet... but taking home leftover ramen feels pretty silly, since the noodles will expand and be weird and soggy by the time you're hungry again... so it ends up feeling wasteful to me. :(   The seating and interior are pretty cramped, with a huge communal table toward the the back. I don't know if installing such a huge communal table was the best idea, because it really dominates that back space there.  Service was prompt and friendly, but when I go out to eat, the most important thing to me is food. I can't say with confidence that the ramen here is remarkable. It's pretty good for the first few bites, but then I end up getting bored in the middle, and don't finish ever it. I can't say with confidence that I would come back here by choice, but wouldn't object if someone else was excited to go/give it a try.",

If you're not skilled with chopsticks, you may want to avoid this place, lest you make the same mistake I did and go with friends who are all chopstick experts and make a fool of yourself while you try to gather udon noodles in your spoon to no avail, leaving you hungry, frustrated and embarrassed. I don't know if they're supposed to offer forks (or if they even have forks) to struggling diners because our server didn't offer one to me. There was a small, sharp chicken bone in my soup that I was lucky enough to find and discard. The taste, quality and temperature of the food were all good, but it can get pricey pretty quickly if you enjoy appetizers and add-ons. I know this place gets excellent reviews all the time, but I have to rate it based on my experience, and unfortunately, my experience wasn't the best.",

(Ha--that's a food joke).  I'm not a foodie, if you can't tell by my reviews--but I know what tastes good, and this place is awesome.    It's a nice, clean little place--makes me feel a little hip and urban, rural guy that I am, without pretension. The wait staff was quick and moderately attentive without being cloying, or hovering.  We ordered, and it wasn't all that long before steaming vats of food appeared in front of us--think serving bowl size portions of rich deliciousness. I had the Tom Yam Men because I love it, and this version was fantastic--chocked full of noodles and big chunks of stuff and just enough heat to make me wish I'd toted in a sixpack.    My friends got some other stuff--there was some chatter about authenticity, but I've never been to Japan and couldn't give less damns about what other countries, or even other restaurants, make: I judge based on what's in front of me and kind of sensory kama sutra it performs on my taste buds.  A few months later I went back, and I didn't even care to try anything else: I ate the same damn thing.  You can't ask for more from food.  I'm a 6'3 345 gluttonous libertine and the generous portion left me more sated than a pair of Dutch prostitutes. I'll be back, even if means delaying visits to some of the other promising places on my list.",

Huge bonus points from me because almost everything on their menu is veggie/vegan friendly, and if it can't be made so, it is specifically indicated on the menu.    The vibe is kind of interesting; the walls are a dark grey and decorated with a ramen mummy zombie-walking out of a bowl...and then there are neon candle holders and napkins on all the tables, I suppose to just brighten things up a bit.  More bonus points from me because they played Radiohead AND Django Django while I was dining.  No 90s movie piano soundtrack at this place!  The food may not be anything special to a lot of people, but I love a giant bowl of steaming broth and noodles, especially on a polar vortex day, so it hit the spot for me.  And Rachel C...I totally finished my bowl in one sitting. ;)",

We got seated at the one big communal table (they have individual tables too) and met some fellow ramen lovers.  They just opened so service was very choppy and the menu is still on photocopied pieces of paper that they asked us to share 1 copy of.  The menu consists of \"make your own ramen\" (pick soup base, type of ramen, extra toppings like egg, corn, nori, etc for a dollar each) or a number of specialty ramens (like kim chee ramen).     All shortcomings with the service was forgiven as a HUGE bowl of steaming hot ramen with all of my requested fixings appeared before me.  Not the most amazing bowl of ramen I have ever had, but it really hit the spot on that cold December night.  And if the owners are reading, I suggest switching from the plastic ladles (not good dipped into boiling hot broth) to the traditional Asian soup spoon!",

    "text": "Not impressed, so far.  Friend and I were excited to try this place as soon as we heard about it and waited until they were officially open to come here for lunch. I had to stalk their facebook to see that they were open all day starting Jan 1 (then changed to Jan 2) from 11AM-10PM. Except I walk in and they tell me they're not open until 12PM. No hours posted on the door, no information on the web.  The \"cash only\" sticker wasn't removed though they now take credit card. The menu is still a wrinkly piece of paper. Seems to me like they really rushed their grand opening, but working out logistics is still understandable.  What I won't be able to look past is their really really mediocre but pricey food. For Pittsburgh, I wouldn't mind paying twice this for a really great bowl of ramen. That, or I love a good valued cheap homey meal. Ramen Bar was neither. My negi ramen had a pretty average shio broth and only a tiny helping of  pork and what seemed like scallions cut 2 ways. Notnotnot worth $9 - and that's without some of the toppings I would consider standard (like an egg) that is extra for $1 here. My friend tried the kimchi ramen off of the \"specialty\" section, which included some things like garlic or curry ramen - interesting twists, but there's not much to dropping delicious store bought kimchi in soup and making it taste great - again, not worth the price. Naturally as kimchi lovers we both liked hers more than mine.    What's REALLY not worth getting, though, is the chicken karaage, at $7, for 5-6 nugget-sized pieces of blandly battered chicken, served alongside iceberg lettuce which took up more of the plate than the chicken did.   The helpings are generous (though it helps if the food were good) and the decor is great. The service was... inexperienced, it seems. At this point, I'm just going chalk many of this up to growing pains. My friend had a much worse impression of the place than I did though, so hopefully next time I'm in town I can actually convince her to see how the place is developing. The potential for a ramen shop in Pittsburgh to succeed is so high, and hopefully Ramen Bar will grow into a great little shop. For now though, they've got a lot of work to do.",

I get the curry raksa ramen, and have the beef substituted with chicken. A careful selection of the broth is all what is needed to make your ramen awesome. Since I like spice, I usually would opt for the spicy shoyu or curry.  What I like about ramen bar is that the service is attentive and friendly. Also they can accommodate a wide range of substitution requests. Recently I tried the green tea Mochi for dessert, and I was definitely impressed.

The place had a casual yet classy feel, with nice tiled floors and furniture made of dark wood. We went around 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon but it was surprisingly popular! The staff were polite and service was very fast. Great place for a quick lunch!  The food was AMAZING! I got the miso ramen ramen and I could not get enough of the soup. So savory, pleasantly salty, warm and comforting. The portion size was great especially for the price! I also got a small side of kimchi which was delicious and hit the spot. My sister got the ramen with wontons and they were very generous with the wontons. My only complaint is that they did not give too much pork with my ramen.  Overall it was a delicious and delightful experience. Would highly recommend and we'll definitely be back!",

The appetizers are pretty good and come out pretty quick. The pork gyoza is great hot. The build your own bowl leaves a lot to be desired but that's the execution when you build your own bowl and I think the place gets a bad rep because of it.   I think the add-ons can be priced differently. Perhaps separated into categories or combined so a few add-ons are free then you are charged for extra. The reason being, if you add all the shtuff that make a good Ramen, you end up with an overpriced bowl and if you don't you end up with a bowl missing it's  flavor.   That all being said if you order their dishes and don't make your own you end up with a pretty darn good bowl of ramen (granted ramen is meant to be cheap and this isn't really).  My favorite is the tan tan men with an egg and mushrooms added. If you are sick go here and grab a bowl, loaded with antioxidants(especially with added onion,shoots and mushrooms) and liquids you'll be back to 100% in no time. I swear by it.",

This is not your college ramen friends, this is superb noodles in flavorful broth served piping hot.    I had the Ramen Wu which was a thick noodle in an egg drop broth.  Full of flavor and a huge serving it warmed me up on a rainy November afternoon.  This place was packed and continued to have a steady stream of people coming in and out.  The space isn't very large which adds to the ambiance of a cozy little soup place.

To that note, I'm a college student and I certainly do not have money to be thrown around. Even when dining (rarely) at expensive places, I keep tips to a minimum, as it is not my duty to pay the waiters/waitresses. If the bill reflects the service charge and we're told beforehand, I'll be perfectly willing to shell out the buck, through an informed decision, reflected in the bill.  So when the minute bill, from Ramen Bar was followed by a delivery boy asking for a tip and then telling me I should go to the restaurant and pickup the food myself, because he doesn't want to drive far (2miles) without a tip, I'm probably never gonna order from this place again, let alone dine in.  As well as another situation, in which the delivery person asked me to pay for the gas for the car through tips for the delivery, however, the person was more respectful, so I let that slide. However, when I was told I should go to the restaurant myself, I was done.  Ramen bar, please pay your delivery staff properly, so that they don't come begging to the customers for their wage and transport.",

Regardless, I appreciate the noodle renaissance we're going through in SqHill.)  Ramen Bar's menu is a lot of hit and very little miss. I really enjoy the standard ramen (shoyu base) and the wontonmen (shoyu base), both of which come with a delicious slice of roast pork. Of all the optional toppings, I've only tried the egg -- I found it to be very nicely cooked, and appreciated what it added to the dish.  The special ramen provide different takes on the dish. Of the many offerings, I like the Wu and Ajo; however, with any of the specials, I find myself missing the roast pork of the standard offering.  The only miss for me was the gyoza appetizer, which is somewhat boring. I've steered away from the appetizers since.  The only downside for me is the price; at $10 / bowl, it's a bit expensive. I would eat here more often if there were a smaller portion at a $7 price point.",

However, as we were finishing our meal, an older guy who seemed like he might be the manager took over serving our table. He was brusque and was obviously trying to rush us. I wanted the remainder of my food boxed to go, and he tried to take our food without asking how everything was or if we were done. When I made clear that I wanted the remainder to go, he placed my dish of hot sauce with the underside resting ON my food. Ew.",

It's also BYOB, which is nice. The atmosphere could be a little better--in winter, every time the door opens a gust of cold wind blows through the entire restaurant. Also, the tables smell weird. But I still go here frequently, and would recommend it if you want some hearty noodle soup to warm you up.",

The noodles does have the same taste/texture as the ramen noodles I am use to bring home.  However, I didn't really care for the broth.  It still tasted great overall but I feel the broth can be better.  What's up with Pittsburgh and wontons?  Everywhere I go, including this place, the wonton sucks.  It is mainly wrapper with a little meat.  All I taste is wrapper.  If you go anywhere in California, wontons are wontons with meat inside.  I'm paying for wontons, not wonton wrappers.  I wish they added pictures to their menu.  We had to run outside to look at their sign that had photos of their dish.  I didn't really think the restaurant look anything amazing.  I did wish the waiter was more attentive.  I didn't get a refill for water until after I was done.  But I do want to come back and give their other dishes a try.  They have potential.",

After everyone in my party had paid (a group of 7, some paying together and some with bank cards) we exited the restaurant. We were about 5 steps from the door when our waiter ran out after us yelling \"Not all of you left tips!\" Excuse me? First of all, even if we hadn't, chasing after us and screaming /making a scene isn't the way to convince us to actually leave you a tip. Secondly, every single person is not going to leave you a cash tip when some are paying together, and some are paying with cards. Common Sense. Lastly, the restaurant actually kept one of our party member's change, which was over $5. They didn't want to demand it as they are non-confrontational. So there's your tip from that customer right there, which technically you stole to begin with. Very saddening.

I understand that the Tonkotsu broth is by far the most time-consuming and difficult ramen to pull off, but really it's the biggest draw for ramen lovers. I don't mind paying $11 for a bowl of al dente noodles with rich broth, but it better be really good.

My boyfriend was a bit trepidatious about the menu because he loves noodles but isn't a big fan of brothy dishes. We ordered \"Chicken Karage\", \"Yom Yam Men\", and \"Tan Tan Men\". The dishes arrived with just a little wait. The karage was extremely juicy with a great creamy dipping sauce. My boyfriend was pleasantly surprised by how much he liked the tan tan men. He ordered it with chicken and broccoli, but decided that next time he'd skip the chicken and double the veggies because they really stole the show with how well they paired with the spicy broth. The yom yam men is reminiscent of vietnamese noodle bowls with its lightly spiced broth and heaping cilantro. Unlike most vietnamese dishes expect lots of delish veggies rather than tons of meat. Really hit the spot for me.  The prices were pretty reasonable for the large amount of food. You don't go over $10 a dish unless you add extra toppings. I really enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to friends. We'll probably be back next month.",

    "text": "Ramen can be the best to warm your insides on a cold, bitter day. There's certainly a lot of those days in Pittsburgh.  I was pretty excited to find out about the Ramen Bar, and was recommended to come here by a few others. While the portions of noodles and broth, there was a lack of vegetables and meats. My Ramen Ramen dish had only a few bean sprouts a single slice of pork. It was great for flavoring the broth, but the meat itself was terribly overcooked.  My partner ordered the seafood ramen, which for $4 more than my dish, and included only two shrimp and and two mussels.   I also wish a spoon had been offered. I struggled to eat my ramen with chopsticks. While we were getting ready to leave, I saw everyone at the table next to ours ask for spoons and forks. I felt kinda silly not asking at that point, but a soupy dish is not easy to eat using chopsticks.  I do applaud the quick service and the hot meal, but I'm curious if I could find a better local ramen place.",

Ramen Bar in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill area is just a place.  I stopped in for dinner and was promptly seated.  I ordered the takoyaki, chashu ramen in a miso base soup with corn, nori, bean sprouts and traditional poached egg with calpico to drink.  The takoyaki arrived hot with plenty of bonito flakes garnishing and melting on top.  Blistering hot but delicious, I might have liked a bit of the traditional okonomiyaki sauce with the mayo but it was fine.  The ramen was perfectly cooked, in a delicious miso broth with truly the most perfect Japanese style poached eggs.  The garnishes were perfect and the bowl was empty before I left.  If you love authentic ramen - Ramen bar is THE place to go for it in Pittburgh.",

    "text": "This is a review of Ramen Bar's food and delivery service. I have never dined in at the restaurant, but have ordered delivery numerous times.  In a few words, Ramen Bar isn't really worth your time, but you can give it a try if you're absolutely craving for ramen. I have had their Tan Tan Men, their Kimchi Udon, their Ramen Ramen, and the Karaage (fried chicken). I really would not consider their ramen authentic 'ramen' as their ramen lacks the richness of broth that is present in good eateries like those of New York. The flavors are acceptable, however, but only acceptable. The karaage (fried chicken) is pretty good. Can't really commend their ramens, unfortunately.  On another note, their delivery service is NOT acceptable. I highly recommend AGAINST ordering from them. Recently I ordered delivery service from them off-peak (around 7:30pm), and it took them over 90 minutes to deliver me my order. I called the restaurant around an hour in, and the person on the phone told me the driver had left a long time ago with my food. This means my food had been sitting in his car for more than 40 minutes by the time I received my food. The driver was unapologetic, and blamed the newness of my residence (it's a new street) for his inability to deliver. He could have CALLED me to ask for cross streets, or asked me for directions, rather than wait for something to happen. By the time my food arrived, the noodles had stuck to themselves already and I had to vigorously pry the strands apart before dining.",

Though I don't know the first thing about ramen or kimchi, I know taste and quality... And Ramen Bar hits the mark.  The menu seemed a bit overwhelming with its many options so I chose a chef's special to avoid creating my own combination and a possible ramen disaster. My Ayo Ramen was filled with noodles prepared to order and delicious ingredients. This was definitely not your usual thought of commercial, freeze dried ramen. The soup was hearty, tasty, and more than enough for a big meal.  My boyfriend got the Korean Kimchi Udon to mix it up and since he enjoys a little spice. The noodles were again fantastic and the meal filling and flavorful without being overly hot or salty.  Next time I want soup, I'm getting Ramen Bar.",

When I realized I was only a few miles from Squirrel Hill and Asian food deliciousness, I knew I had to make a side adventure, and this adventure brought me to Ramen Bar.  I love real ramen (now that I realize it's not the top ramen of dorm room days), but I'm far from an expert, so I asked the server for a recommendation.  Without hesitation, he recommended the Tan Tan Men.  While I overestimated my spiciness tolerance, this was delicious stuff!  Very flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, tasty beef, and spinach.  Soooo good but soooo hot.  And, at $10 for a giant bowl of soup, a great deal!  All of the servers were very friendly.  I was by myself, and they found me a seat immediately at the bar, which was nice.  I don't get a  chance to go into Pittsburgh itself all that often, but next time I do, I may be making a return to Ramen Bar.",

    "text": "I was so thrilled as I was surprised that there was a ramen shop in Pittsburgh!! The place was pretty small but cozy. As we walked in, they sat the two of us at the big table (seats about 15 people) which you share with other parties. While we were looking at the menu, our waiter kept coming over to ask if we were ready which was a bit annoying since it was our first time there. We ended up making up our own ramen bowl. Mine was the shoyu broth, ramen, egg and chasiu. We also ordered takoyaki and pork gyoza. The takoyaki came first which tasted pretty fresh (6 pieces). I liked the takoyaki as it was a pretty good size and it was fresh. The gyoza came next which was a disappointment.  The gyozas came in 6 pieces with a sauce for dipping. I didn't really like it as it was a bit cold and I think that the frozen ones from trader Joe's taste better!! The ramen came shortly after. I was soo excited for this and was truly disappointed.  The broth had NO taste and so did the chasiu. I felt like I was eating something which was seriously tasteless. The egg was not fully cooked which might have been the highlight of my ramen. The spicy shoyu tasted a bit better but I still did not like it.   The cost of the takoyaki was definitely worth t but not for everything else. The gyoya was about $5.50 which as mentioned you can get better ones at other restaurants or trader Joe's for cheaper. My ramen was $12 which was definitely not worth it as I left about half of it. Occasionally,  I had ramen at different restaurants and this was one of my least favorites. Overall, I would not go back to this place. Glad that I tried it though.",

My boyfriend and I paid a visit last Sunday while we were visiting Pittsburgh, and we were both so happy we did!   We started off with the pork gyoza, which were perfectly fried and tasted almost exactly like my homemade Korean dumplings (mondu/mandu for the purists out there), which was a welcome surprise and we both loved them. My boyfriend got the tom yum ramen with tofu and I got the tan tan men with tofu. Too good, y'all, omg.  My tan tan men was just spicy enough, and the noodles were perfect. The tofu was also especially tasty, something that we weren't expecting - it was cut in rather large cubes, but was gorgeously silky and took on the flavor of the broth well. It was awesome.  The service is fast and friendly, and the space is well-decorated and cozy (we really liked the noodle mummy on the wall!). Heads up, seating is a little limited - there's a large table that can fit many people, but it looks like the staff also use it to seat smaller parties (almost like at hibachis, without the rice-flinging man in the middle). Also parking can admittedly be difficult, so be sure to factor that in. That being said, it was super super worthwhile experience AND the prices were reasonable: 10/10 would recommend everyone give it a go!",

It was maybe a step above soy sauce and water. Also they nickel and dime you for toppings that should be standard, like an egg and nori. The pricing leaves you paying $12-14 for a bowel of \"meh\" ramen.   With that said, they do have a lot of other noodle choices that could be better.

There is just something so satisfying about these large noodles; it helps that they are firm. The taste of broth was good and the amount of seafood in the soup was more than enough to make up for the extra price.   My only concern about the food was the condition of the vegetables, but I did take out for the soup so I figure I should try it out again to see if perhaps the driving distance caused the limp, sogginess of the veggies. I have already recommended this establishment to others.",

    "text": "For me this is really a 3.5, but I'm inclined to round up since it's probably one of the better ramens you can find around here. The menu is quite extensive in that they have Chinese and Thai style noodle bowls in addition to the more standard Japanese ramen. The price is not too bad, considering the size of the noodle bowl that they give you. Ordering the shoyu \"ramen ramen,\" we found that the noodles were cooked pretty well and weren't too hard or too soft. There was a generous amount of toppings as well, and the chashu pork was actually pretty tender. The only mediocre part of course was the broth--while it was nice and hot, it lacked savoriness and so wasn't particularly memorable. Still, it's a nice place to go for a bowl of noodle soup, and with so many different options available it shouldn't be too hard to find something you like.",

This place reminds me of a ramen restaurant in Los Angeles called Ramenya but nowhere near as good. The bowls of ramen were okay. Decent variety of ramen but the flavors could be better. Ajo Ramen and miso ramen were good. Try to stay away from the basic create your own bowl ramen.  This is pretty much the only place you can get ramen in Pittsburgh, so it has that going for them, however I hope being as trendy as ramen has become in America, someone will open a decent tonkotsu ramen in Pittsburgh. Please someone.",

    "text": "Based upon the reviews and information from friends, I gave a try.  As a native Japanese who loves ramen noodles, I would rate the taste as 3 stars.  The reasons are;  1) the soup does not have much 'broth\" taste and it is covered much by miso (I ordered miso ramen) to make it up.  Not bad but I wish I could taste the broth (either chicken or pork bone base with some vegetables).    2) Ratio of noodle and soup was not well balanced.  As a ramen lover who has eaten many ramens in Japan, the volume of noodle was low.  I would like to be full with more noodle than soup.    3) The sliced pork was too thick and does not have much flavor.  They call it chasyu but the size and the thickness were way too big for the authentic ramen topping.  The sliced pork for the authentic Japanese ramen is seasoned with; soy, sake, mirin, sugar, ginger, garlic, scallion, and simmer the whole block for a few hours, then thinly sliced like a ham.  The authentic ramen usually comes with 1-2 slices while Chasyu-men serves with 4-5 slices.  This thick slice was dry, tasteless, and not fun to eat.  4) The negi (green onion) was also too thick.  Again, the authentic ramen noodles do not have thick sliced green onions.  They usually served with thinly sliced ones.  5) Menma (seasoned bamboo shoots) was probably not homemade.  That's OK even in Japan, menma is not always homemade.  It was not too bad.  Here is a good one I can defend.  1) Seasoned eggs were pretty good.  They were not hard boiled; still soft inside and nicely seasoned with soy base sauce.    2) The entire volume was very generous.  I was thinking about ordering soy-base ramen as an extra (shoyu ramen) but one bowl of miso was enough.    This is my only first try and I won't judge this potentially good restaurant with a negative thoughts, therefore, I would rate as 3 stars for now.  There are many other items I would love to try.    If this place wants to serve the real and authentic Japanese style ramen noodle, they probably need a little more research and improve the smaller details.  Again, I am a native Japanese and knows about ramen probably more than the average diners there, thus, my criticism may sound too much and too picky but since they sell Japanese style ramen, I needed to say what I thought.    I will visit again soon.",

The small dining room has the tables packed in, but the atmosphere is more cozy than crowded.   The food - My favorite is the Tan Tan Men. Not too spicy (for me), and the sesame-based broth is rich and flavorful. My friend's favorite is kimchi udon.  I've also tried Japanese udon, veggie ramen, wonton men, and a few appetizers. Always hot (heat, not spice). I usually stick to their specialties, mostly because I find the broth options more flavorful than their basic shoyu and miso.  However, dining companions have had few complaints. Also, take out and delivery options are available - who wouldn't want to eat spicy ramen in front of their non-working, ancient gas fireplace on a cold night?   **Note: I don't have other ramen dining experiences to compare it to, but Ramen Bar is a solid choice among the other dining options in Squirrel Hill.",

Got the Negi Ramen with Shoyu base with egg, white onions (For some reason in my post-Gastro stupor I did not realize this would be a legit white onion chopped up in slices--thought would be white chives for some reason, but that's a me problem not a them problem), spinach, and mushrooms. I was really excited that mushrooms are an option, because I live right near Tan Izakaya and have been disappointed that mushrooms are not an option in their ramen.  My food came earlier than GrubHub protected and was still warm enough that I did not have to reheat it. The seasoning on the seasoned pork and marinated onions was very nice, and I really liked the soup base. The mushrooms were shiitake only, and the dry seaweed is cut up into tiny strips. The egg was still Runny and very delicious. I was very happy with my food, the only things I would've changed would be bigger pieces of dry seaweed and adding maybe some oyster mushrooms in there.  Also, this was legitimately two big meals and I will be ordering from here frequently as a medical resident on a budget!",

Last time I visited, I also ordered the Tan Tan Men, so I can say that overall taste remains consistent across visits.   I really like the soup base flavor of the Tan Tan Men and the noodles are good too. I would probably add vegetables next time or order edmame on the side if I were to get the Tan Tan Men again since the original order itself doesn't have a lot of veggies. Otherwise, looking forward to visiting this place again sometime and trying another ramen order!",

I eat ramen at home on the regs (when Im broke sometimes) but also because I love noodles, sometimes i get wild and eat Ramen for breakfast- there is no wrong time to eat Ramen. The ramen here is way better than 99 cent top ramen from the store (Obvi)...  They have a lot of different broths/noodle combinations that are pretty interesting. I usually get the Octopus balls as an app- also delicious.  Really good noodles decent prices, especially good on a cold winter evening when you are hungry and in the Squirrel Hill area!",

Upon looking at the pics of various dishes posted outside and realizing that this was more than a few steps up from the packaged Ramen on which I survived in college, I decided to venture in.  I was greeted very pleasantly. I ordered a cocount curried soup with wheat noodles and beef. Although the beef was a little tough I though the soup was delicious. It wasn't too sweet or too bland but imo had just the right flavor and spice. The place had a pleasant decor. I would have preferred either outdoor seating or more windows on the front for outdoor viewing but all of that was really minor.  My dish was excellent not to mention I was able to leave it in my car all night (something I try not to practice), heat it up the next morning adding two hard-boiled eggs to it, and indulge it with no problems. The price at around $10 wasn't bad considering the serving size. Finally, the service was excellent as the guy serving my food was pleasant and genuine. Verdict: I'll be returning to try their other dishes.",

Their soup was not bad, the service was good for the price, but that's where the positive part ends. The noodle obliviously just came out from the refrigerator and was not cooked well, as they stick together into several chunks, which really made me uncomfortable. The meat (chashu) also felt like it had been frozen for some time and was defrozen hastily. The overall taste and presentation was not authentic. It's neither Japanese or Chinese, at least. While it's a relieving that they have bamboo shots (some ramen restaurants in New York don't!), it's not what ramen should taste like. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I like their Chicken kara-age, which was way better than the ramen itself.  Now, if you have never tasted ramen before I won't stop you from trying this place since good noodles (of any type) are quite rare in Pittsburgh. But this is not what I would expect from a ramen specialty restaurant.",

Is there something more about it?  Lets go in and find out.  We both ordered a Vegtable heavy Ramen noodle dish and we ordered two extras Shrimp and Pork Dumplings.  The Pork dumplings were wonderful delicious wantons and they were absoluetly wondeful.  The shrimp beware!  Do not order these.  You get four shrimp for 2 beans alright enough, but they have the tails still on them.  Ok you say I like a whole shrimp.  No no no I mean the shell of the tail.  Oh yum just what you want to eat.  A shrimp shell.  Yummie yummie that hard texture in your tummy.  Worse yet then you can burn yourself when the soup which is pipping hot and you go, ew I don't want these.  Worse yet, asking for take out, they seperate the soup from the noodles.  So you have a container of soup and a container of ramen.  Just what you wanted right?  Right?  So why 4 stars?  Starters service was EXCELLENT, I mean she was hopping and bobbing and right on top of everything.  I really was glad to be treated as a valued customer and not like some shmoo.  Pricing is reasonable with 9 dollar bowls and 2 dollars for extras.  That's good soup!  Seating arrangements is spacious and there's plenty of room around.    Overall its a good place to go and I'd go again.  And by the way it's homemade Ramen not Top Ramen there.",

I ordered the kim chi ramen that comes with chicken, kim chi, and green onions with a shoyu base.  There only 2 choices for base in the whole menu, shoyu or miso, which is disappointing.  I agree with others that it is lacking the tonkotsu base which authentic ramen places typically have.  Also the extra ingredients al la carte list is really limited, though when I asked about fish cakes and mushrooms (not on the list) they actually did have them and let me add them (though didn't have different varieties of fish case or mushrooms as most places would have).  I'm really glad I added extra because the amount of chicken I was given was pathetic--just a few miniscule pieces of poor quality chicken (gristly, dry, all dark meat).  The green onions were also few and cut longways in huge pieces.  And there was only a few pieces of kim chi apparent.  And the sauce other than the flavor of the kim chi was completely bland.  It tasted like boiling water with a little bit of kim chi flavor in it.  It was thin and not complex or interesting at all.  And after spending $15 on it, it is much pricier than much better ramen I've had elsewhere.  The decor was nice and service friendly, but not enough to make up for the disappointing ramen :(  UPDATE:  I went back again and will upgrade this to 3 stars since what I had this time was much better and more flavorful.  I think it was called the Yan Tan Men? and it had ground beef and spinach with a spicy orange broth.  I don't know what was in the broth exactly but it was way more tasty and flavorful than what I had last time.  But my issues from the earlier review still remain.  I think this place has potential though and I'll give it some time.",

    "text": "Am absolutely stoked that Pittsburgh has got its own dedicated ramen bar now. I think the only other Japanese related craze we now need to get on is an izakaya bar (Japanese tapas... for the most excellent small plate Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh, try Tamari's happy hour... cannot be beat for price and quality). This place has all the right moves, and reasonable prices to boot. I know it might be sticker shock to pay $11 for a bowl of noodle soup, but these bowls are HUGE. And delicious.  If you are expecting the more traditional fatty pork broth, you won't find it here, but that might be for the best, given your New Year's resolutions. Their broths are plenty good regardless, with a choice between shoyu (soy), miso, and plain salted broth. I thought the miso was a bit too potent for my taste, and prefer the shoyu. It has a subtle flavor that builds over the course of the meal.  Ultimately, the ajo ramen is my favorite, even though it's not exactly \"authentic.\" If you like garlic, you'll love this. And if you love someone who loves garlic, well... let's just say that you'll be safe from vampires after dinner.  Apps are relatively expensive, given the quantity, but the noodle bowls are enough for a full meal. Staff is very friendly and attentive, although they can get a bit behind when they are swamped.",

We had some staff who were incredibly friendly and out going while our main waitress was gruffy and looked like she wanted to beat someone up but her mood seemed to lighten up towards the end.  Their gyozas were good, and I ordered their Ajo or garlic ramen as my main. If you love garlic, you will enjoy this dish as much as I do though I might not suggest this dish for a first date, unless you bring some gum! The portions are large, the meat/egg and vegetables were cooked fine, and the broth itself had dried garlic chips and a handful of whole garlic cloves so you will be all about garlic.  This was perfect for a cold night, and BYOB.",

The beef in it was like chewing shoe leather and the shrimp was a laughable portion.   My friend got a cold noodle dish and it was absolutely amazing! I would definitely come back for that or to try a different soup. The vegetable gyoza was bland, and the fried chicken app was boring as well except for the sauce that came with it.

It's a clean, modern-looking establishment with relatively decent service and a good selection of food choices on their menu.  I had the ajo Ramen which was flavorful and spicy hot in the way I like it.  Sriracha sauce came out promptly as I pre-emptively asked for, which automatically deserves an extra star in my book.    Service can improve a bit, though.  I felt like things were just a bit too slow at times, though I bet some of that has to do with the popularity of this place.  It gets packed!",

Everyone at my table had to ask for extra flavor (hot sauce) and we all ended up using soy sauce too.  There were a decent number of veggie in the soup.  The egg on top was a pre-soft boiled egg (not cooked on top of the bowl as I have seen in some other ramen bars). Each bowl seemed to have a good amount of veggies in each bowl.    I was unpleasantly surprised to hear that they use chicken broth in their miso base soup.  Why spoil a good thing?  Miso is a great stand alone flavor, I don't get it.  Make sure you ask for the veggie broth when you come if you need to as isn't on the menu.",

Some of the options can be a little bland, but for the price, the ambiance, and the friendly staff, this little place has become a staple.

Staff is very friendly and are more than happy to explain the menu and provide recommendations especially if you're a first time Ramen Bar visitor, and food comes out very quickly, and the quality is great.  During my visits to Ramen Bar, I tried the following dishes: Friday - Takoyaki, Wonton Men with a spicy shouyu broth plus corn and an egg, Saturday - Vegetable Ramen with a spicy shouyu broth alongside Japanese Fried Rice. Sunday - Kim Chi Udon.  The takoyaki arrived piping hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a squid flavoring - a perfect appetizer to accompany a giant bowl of ramen. The Japanese fried rice with chicken was also freshly prepared and outstanding - much better than the typical fried rice one would get from a takeout Chinese restaurant - it was very similar to hibachi styled fried rice.   The spicy shouyu broth is flavorful and definitely worth trying if you want a light, yet hearty broth. It has a nice heat to it that very slowly builds on you as you eat - perfect thing to get if you're coming down with a cold. The pork wontons in my Wonton Men were lightly filled with pork, and the ramen noodles were fresh, perfectly cooked, and remained al dente throughout my entire meal. The roasted pork was very soft and flavorful, and the addition of the egg with runny yolk adds a new level the giant bowl of flavors.  The menu offers a large selection of items so it's almost impossible to get tired of this place, especially with all of the different ingredients you can add to the ramen.",

    "text": "Ramen Bar delivers everything you want about a ramen place. The service is quick, tables and seating are nice, there is a cool Japanese culture vibe about it (even though Chinese people run it), and of course, the ramen is good. Most ramen places have the just-right, chewy ramen noodles, as does Ramen Bar, but what separates this place from others is the meat and the soup. Meat is cooked so that it's still very juicy, which is hard to come across, and it's flavored very well. It might be on the salty side for people who like bland foods but as someone who craves flavor, I loved the meat. And then the soup --- wow. It has a really deep and hearty feel to it. You can really taste the broth, and it doesn't have too many particles and random veggies that usually end up in the yuck pile.  Awesome experience for me, and I can't wait to try the other soup and meat combinations for ramen they have to offer.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We arrived around at 7:15 to find the restaurant absolutely packed and we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait.  The inside of Ramen Bar is fairly tiny (seating for 34 at normal tables and a large community table that can seat 14) with tile floors and a ramen \"mummy\" caricature drawn on one wall and a picture of a large Asian city (Tokyo's Shibuya Center?) on the other.  The temperature was in the single digits, so anytime the door was opened a blast of cold air reached our table and probably most of the tables in the restaurant.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split the takoyaki for an appetizer and then I went with the ajo ramen for my entree.  Our appetizer came out first and consisted of the fried octopus balls covered in bonito flakes amongst other things.  They actually had enough other stuff on them that the balls themselves were hard to see.  That didn't really matter though and my wife and I dug in.  The takoyaki was rather tasty and was crispy on the outside and then soft and chewy in the middle.  My wife and I quickly polished them off and within a short time our ramen arrived.  It was piping hot which was nice as it counteracted any of the cold that was let in by the door.  As a matter of a fact I was left sweating by the time that I had finished my meal. The ramen had a really good flavor to it which mainly consisted of garlic and pork.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crispy garlic which was still tasty even after it got soggy in the broth.  The only complaint I had was that on the menu it was marked as a spicy dish (a pepper next to it) and while I noticed a few red pepper flakes floating around in it I got no heat from it at all.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My wife and I both enjoyed our meals here a lot and I am looking forward to trying more of their ramen dishes.",

It exceeded all of my expectations and was super delicious. The perfect food and my new go to for whenever I'm battling a cold.

Unfortunately they don't have tonkatsu ramen (and looks like nowhere in Pittsburgh does yet- sigh), but they had some other good choices to satisfy the craving.  I got the curry raksa ramen and my boyfriend built his own with the spicy miso base.  Both of our bowls were flavorful, not salty, just deep flavor.  The bowls are huge, so definitely worth the money.  Noodles were good, not to over cooked which a lot of ramen places tend to do.  We will definitely go back and would get the same two ramens!  Docking a star because they don't have tonkatsu ramen.  It's everywhere in Tokyo so pretty disappointing that it is so difficult to find in Pittsburgh!!",

We got two seats at the large table toward the back of the restaurant. At first I didn't think I would like it there but it turned out great - I think better than a traditional table. The ramen tasted great, and was a great way to warm us up on this cold, rainy Pittsburgh afternoon. My wife, who grew up on this stuff, was happy to see fish cake as an option. I am really liking the ramen options in Pittsburgh!",

I had a Ramen bowl with pork and miso soup.  Oh man, that broth was so flavorful.  I was so full but I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole thing.  Next time I'd ask for the same dish but without pork.  I felt the pork was tough, didn't really add anything flavor wise, and got in the way of my noodles!  The noodles and veggies were also delicious.  I heard the Ramen with the dumplings in it was delicious and so was the tofu.    The ambiance is a mix of casual and intimate.  I would recommend going here for a first date or when you're trying to figure out if you like the person or not.  It's just enough to be cute but not too much where it feels like a real date.    If you're vegan, this place is very vegan friendly.  The server was helpful with stating which dishes were vegan or could be made vegan.  Any place where the servers even know what vegan means gets a win in my book.",

I recognize the smell of the canned meat cuz that's what I eat when I m lazy at home..... Oh well, I ask for it I guess... At least I know now why everyone around me told me \"Don't go\" so ....

With all the other Asian restaurant opinion on the same street, I don't think I will be back here anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad but it really isn't up to par compared to everything else around it.  I came here not long after it first opened and was really excited that a Ramen place finally came to Pittsburgh! One star for their interior set up - I had a lot of fun sitting at a big square table that's shared with different people! After going through a menu, I see they do have quite a few options for ramen and it was a hard decision because I wanted several of the options listed! Anoter star is for variety! The prices are very similiar to the other ramen places in the big cities, which is fine to me as well. But when the noodles finally came out, reality also hits......  First of all, the noodles weren't as hot as it should be - since a big part that makes ramen taste so good is the fact it's almost steaming hot! And the taste was very so-so. Although nothing tasted bad, but their soup base is no where close to the other places I've tried. Nothing with the flavors made me want to come back again soon. But immediately I know that as long as there are other Asian food next door, I don't want to pay the price I did and come back for mediocore noodles.  BUT WAIT.....I did give them a third star because this is the ONLY ramen place in the greater  Pittsburgh region. And if you've NEVER HAD ramen before, this is still a good place to test out just for the ramen experience. Other than that, I wasn't very impressed overall.",

I get scared of the chopsticks and fear that I will regret my order and end up getting worst thing at the table.   Yesterday, I went to Ramen Bar for the first time due to a friends request. The staff was very friendly and helped me order something that most 'non-Asian food eaters' enjoy. The food came out quickly and was beyond amazing. The noodles, caressed in a flavorful broth, reminded me of my college days where all we could afford were ramen noodles; but these were a lot better and had  a touch of class. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for something delicious and different.",

The service was not good at that time, but I understand they just opened business and need time to get on track.  After the opening, I came back at a Friday night, with expectation of slightly improved service.  My friend and I were waiting at the door while two groups were waiting inside. After 10 minutes, a waitress walked to us and asked whether we wanted to seat at the bar, we said yes, thinking the other two groups might not want to sit in the bar.  Right after we took off the heavy winter coats and sat down, the owner came to us, in front of everyone, said very loudly \" hey, you cannot sit here, those people came first!\"  It was so rude, embarrassing, offensive, and insulting! I replied politely, though still very confused, \"but your waitress invited us?\" I was trying to point to the waitress. The owner interrupted and said \"Don't point! I know who she is and I have already YELLED at her. Look, I am just trying to be reasonable, okay?\"  Does that mean we are not reasonable? We did not bribe or lie to the waitress to get in. If the owner walked to us in a POLITE manner and explained the situation, we would understand and go back to the waiting line. Instead, the happy Friday night was destroyed by the way we were treated.   We decided to leave the restaurant right away and never come back again. We don't want to have food at a place owned by people who YELL all the time. If he/she doesn't treat people well, who knows how they treat food.",

I used to just get the ramen ramen but I've since discovered their wontons, so I now get the wonton men in a shoyu base with an egg. I get the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts on the side and no green onion because I do not like to mix anything with my noodles but meat. The pork slices are average, but the wontons are simple and delicious, the filling is just a solid piece of soft meat and both go great with the noodles.  The noodles are nice and firm and perfectly cooked, and go well with all of the meats and the egg. Even their boiled egg is so good I started to make my eggs like they do. The broth is so delicious that I can't resist the urge to sit and sip on it while waiting for my friends to finish even though I know it's unhealthy and I'm already really full. The portions are huge and satisfying. When I'm looking for a warm, simple, filling meal I always suggest ramen bar.",

That being said the Ramen was delicious and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy.  I can't speak for their specialty ramen, we had the roasted pork miso ramen and the ramen with regular broth and dumplings. Miso is my personal fave and it was rich and delicious with perfectly chewy noodles and a nicely done soft boiled egg. This place is an excellent addition to the often mediocre/awful Asian food scene.   Based on my fellow yelpers maybe consistency is an issue but give this place a chance!",

To get more authentic, specialty food, you have to head to Squirrel Hill. There you will find more authentic options for Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese fare.   Ramen Bar is one of the few places to find authentic Ramen. Chose a standard Ramen dish or build your own with a base Ramen entree. I went for Wonton Men, adding corn, shrimp and pork wontons (I know. I actually added wontons to a wonton dish. What can I say? I like wontons and dumplings!). I chose spicy miso broth but it wasn't really spicy at all.  I also had a side of pork goyza (potstickers).  Very good and filling. Though I went in June, I would love to go back in the winter for a steaming bowl of noodle soup to warm up on a cold day!",

But what bothered me the most was the service that we received here and how the management handled customer complaints.  I ordered the garlic fried rice, and my boyfriend ordered a miso ramen. the garlic fried rice came out smelling great, the problem starts when we actually started to eat our food. The garlic bits are BURNT to a different color, and we all know how burnt garlic taste, thats right, BITTER. When I told the manager who was present that the garlic tasted like it was burnt, and his first response was \"No it's not. That's how it should be done.\" And I kept trying to tell him like i have tasted fried garlic before, hell i even make it myself all the time, and burnt stuff is still burnt. He then walked away after insisting that's how it is. He then came back with a small bowl of fried garlic, and I showed him how the garlic from my rice and the garlic he brought out are different colors and he kept sayin this is how it's done.  I personally felt like the management was downplaying my concern with the food and just kept refusing to send the food back.",

I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the Spicy Shoyu Chashu Ramen. Although the base had a good flavor, the entire dish itself was missing something I cannot pin point. The Vegetable Ramen with a spicy miso base was very tasty and was loaded with veggies. Another one we tried was the Curry Ramen. The Curry Ramen was not as spicy as I would have expected it to be and with all of the spicy dishes we requested additional hot paste to add to them.   Overall, the food tasted good and I would definitely give it another shot. Pleased with the dishes but something was missing that would push it to a 4 star.",

I ordered the Curry Ramen ($10.50) and my friends ordered the Ramen \"Wu\" ($10.50) and Vegetable Ramen ($10.00) (the prices on the menu online are incorrect). The soup in my ramen was perfect and delicious, not too thick and not too watery, and the mashed up carrots (or some other type of vegetable) in it gave it a very homey feeling. The pork was a good texture and full of flavor. I tried a bit of the egg drop soup in the Ramen \"Wu\", and it was also so good, I almost regretted not ordering that!  We came in on a Sunday at around 3:30pm, and the restaurant was about 90% full which is crazy! Our food came out very quickly and just the right amount of hot to start eating immediately without burning our mouths. I docked a star because I really disliked the attitude of our waitress. It was almost like she went out of her way to be rude, for example asking me to move my menu while sounding impatient so she could set down my glass of water, even though there was plenty of other table space around me! She really soured my mood for the whole meal whenever she stopped by, which wasn't even that often.  I would definitely consider stopping by Ramen Bar next time I'm in Pittsburgh, but I might take a peek inside to see if that waitress is around before deciding to dine there or not.",

Lastly, they provided pictures on the menu, so you can really understand what you're ordering. Other factors - there was a busy atmosphere about the restaurant, the wait staff was friendly and quick as well, it's a nice place for conversation, and Ramen Bar can seat both small and large groups!

It's awkwardly high while you're waiting for your food, but when a giant bowl of ramen appears before you, the minimal distance from food-to-mouth suddenly becomes a source of great comfort.  Second, we lingered at the counter for a long time after we finished eating, without feeling rushed or unwelcome at all. Granted the place was pretty empty on a snowy Sunday night  I had the vegetable ramen with a spicy miso base. I liked how they had vegetarian options clearly marked on the menu. The food itself was ok, warm and comforting but not particularly flavorful, and definitely not too spicy",

The takoyaki is also what i expected, crispy and many bonito flakes/kezu ri bushi. It is fun watching the flakes dancing.   The Tom yum men is ok. Big portion, but they are using frozen vegetable. I prefer the fresh one. Many thai dishes in many places use frozen veggie. Not sure if that is supposed to be so for Thai dish.  Anyway, no complains. Good food for the price.",

I come to The Ramen Bar every couple of months to get the same exact Ramen (Tan Tan Men).  I've have this dish with all the possible flavors (Seafood, Pork, Beef, Chicken, Tofu). My favorite is the chicken, but the best in my opinion is the seafood(they are all great).   The Ramen bar can be a nice date spot as well as a group outing.   Not shown is the Chicken Karage which is a great appetizer. The chicken is tender, fried and seasoned perfectly.",

The employees are all so friendly and check on you often for water, etc. I've never encountered a wait, but it's a smaller space and it's always fairly crowded.  I always start my meal with some takoyaki. It's so delicious and seasoned perfectly with sauces and bonito flakes. I love all of their ramen choices--you can either make your own or order one of theirs. I usually get either the kimchi udon or tom yum men. There are a decent amount of vegetarian options, and I'm sure they have other ways of accommodating diets that aren't explicitly on the menu. The food always comes out super fast, VERY hot, and huge portions. You really can't go wrong coming here!",

He also said that the bugs might have been on the vegetables. I reminded him that proper food preparation and washing would remove the bugs. He laughed and said that they do clean the vegetables but that sometimes the bugs can't be seen. I received the new soup and there were three little bugs in there, too.

I didn't know what to think of that at first, but it still felt pretty intimate. Within minutes of ordering, our food came out too.  There are so many options! The portion sizes are very generous too. I ordered my ramen with shrimp. The only downside was that the shrimp was basically just thrown on top (with the tails) so it didn't have much flavor and it was a little hard to eat with chop sticks.  Overall, this place is SO good. It was just so HOT in there. They had a space heater, and although it's winter.. when you're eating soup it keeps you pretty warm anyways!",

The soup was served in a gigantic bowl, piping hot. I would have liked maybe a little more flavor to the broth but I really can't complain-it was so fresh and tasty! My dining companion ordered the curry raksa ramen (which is what I originally wanted but I thought the spice might be a little much for me and was I right!) and added an egg and chicken to it. He made the comment he would have liked the udon noodles in his dish instead of the ramen but that was his only complaint. He said it was spicy but the sweetness of the coconut curry really toned down the spice and the flavors melted together amazingly. We both can't wait to come back and try other menu items since everything looked so yummy!",

    "text": "It seems like every time I walk in here, it's never busy.  Most people would be turned off by this, but I know better.  I love soup, and I lived off ramen in college, so to find an upscale ramen that I can eat without having dorm room flashbacks is top notch.  The atmosphere is nice, simple, not your usual tacky paintings of tigers and samurais adorning the walls.  Dark colored tables and walls...it's relaxing.  The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is the giant table.  I don't think anyone would be excited to be seated at a family style table with other parties of two, I've seen it before, no one likes to be paired up with complete strangers.  The food is pretty straight forward.  Typical appetizers, I got dumplings, and they were dumplings, slam dunk.  The ramen menu is straight forward as well, lots of pre-set items, and if you want to act like you know ramen more than the chef, you can make something yourself that  will probably be disgusting, and you'll send back, because you're an awful person.  Oh, and I dont think the noodles are made fresh, but if they were, that would be over the top.  Everything tastes great, but when it comes down to it, it's soup, nothing is going to straight blow you away, but there are some great flavors in the broth, and some pretty substantial ingredients that are a nice touch to an entree that can barely be considered a meal.  But yeah, anytime I'm in squirrel hill and am looking for a casual lunch, or even an early dinner, I like to check out ramen bar.",

    "text": "Being a native San Franciscan, perhaps my taste buds have been a tad spoiled by the array of noodle shops in the City. Sadly, I've found Ramen Bar to just be okay. However, if I could rate them on their ambiance and set-up in general,  I would've given them 5-stars. Everything from the beautiful backdrop of Ginza in the back to the unique lighting provides an intimate setting for a date or just a get together with a close friend. But, back on tangent...  They have a nice selection of appetizers, ramen, and rice dishes. I've tried most of their rice dishes and have found them to be pretty good. Their tenshindon stands out the most, with its most fluffy eggs and tender shrimp covered in a thick sweet and tangy sauce. It's an absolute delight to my mouth and taste buds. Their curry is a bit lacking, as I can taste is the kick of the spice, but not so much in terms of actual flavor. Their ramen is acceptable. You have a choice of miso or shouyu (soy sauce) base along with you choice of toppings. There are a few set selections of ramen that you can choose from as well, if you don't feel like creating your own bowl. The noodles are on point, soft, but with a slight chew. The stock is a bit bland in comparison to a traditional bowl of ramen, where chefs try to pack as much flavor in the soup to bring the all the flavors of the toppings and noodles together. What also bugged me was the fact that their wontons were always undercooked in the part where the dough seals together, but is severely overcooked elsewhere.   Overall, I was a bit disappointed, as this place looked quite promising. I'd go back for their rice dishes and the ambiance if I were in the area. However, I wouldn't venture all the way to Sq. Hill just to go there.",

    "text": "I was in pittsburgh on vacation I was craving ramen and I thought I would give this place a try bc other yelpers posted such delicious looking pictures...  My oh my were they deceiving.  I had the chashu ramen in shoyu broth with an egg because it seemed like a safe bet. Overall the bowl was less than satisfactory, the aroma was meh, the egg was completely bland, broth was weak in soy flavor, and the chashu was pretty tasteless.  My favorite topping for ramen usually is menma (fermented bamboo) and somehow that was ruined- which baffles me because you can buy jars from Asian markets that taste better.  The only saving grace was the noodles, which was firm and cooked just right.   The miso broth my friend had was better, but not by much.   I was sad when I walked out because it didnt hit the spot at all.   Give it a try if you're feeling adventurous, but just know there are better ramen out there (idk about in Pittsburgh though).",

Of course, I am tremendously white and very American, so I have no way to speak to its authenticity as traditional Japanese cuisine. But I do know that it tastes good to me.   I've given four stars because the restaurant itself is quite small and can get incredibly crowded during the weekend. I have minor claustrophobia, so this was a little uncomfortable for me once when I ate there during dinner rush on a Saturday night.   I recommend trying to go there during the week or during a not rush hour if you have any claustrophobia. Because when it isn't super full, the small restaurant is quite nice and cozy!  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Squirrel Hill!",

I don't exactly recall which ramen dish I ended up getting, but like many who have wrote reviews for this place, I remember it being extremely salty and as such, I had to drink a heck of a lot of water to be able to eat it all. That being said, the quality of the ramen here is really subpar and not in line with quality standards that you would find in a respectable ramen joint in other cities on the East Coast (let's not even begin talking about how it falls short of baseline quality standards for West Coast ramen). It's also really oily, which didn't particularly go well with my conscience. Oh and for what you're getting, the price is rather ... not particularly worth it. Really salty, oily, and as for the noodles? Subpar. Not sure I'd want to come back here for another go around.",

The squid was bland and had a rubbery texture, which makes you wonder how they prepare the seafood. On top of that, the broth was virtually flavorless, even though it had so many ingredients in it. The most flavorful bite of the night was the cilantro on top as garnish. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed that a bowl of ramen with essentially no flavor whatsoever costed $13.",

The shrimp was plentiful in the dish however I found myself wanting more mushrooms and the egg was hard boiled I had been hoping for a poached egg one with a runny yoke.

The one here: Soy soup base: no soy sauce savor, but all covered up by daikon. Don't get me wrong. I love soup base with daikon, but it's just not the right smell for \"soy\" soup base. The right one should come from the savor of good soy sauce and long cooked pork bones. I didn't taste strong msg tho. That's good at least. Shoyu- the pork is as hard as beef jerky and tasteless :( Topping egg: it's plain! I love how the egg is soft boiled, but it should be flavorful. It should be marinated in the cold sauce for hours/days.  Overall, it's an ok place if you are really craving for a bowl of japanese raman. Just don't expect too much.",

If you're the kind of person who has never experienced ramen except for cheap instant noodles in college, then... surprise, surprise! the $12 offering at Ramen Bar is far superior to a disposable $0.50 meal. But, if you have ever been to Japan, or to any large American or Canadian city that has real ramen, then you will immediately realize that what the Ramen Bar serves up is only a poor imitation at best.  I tried the shoyu chashu ramen, a classic dish that earned the Tsuta ramen shop in Tokyo a Michelin Star. At the Ramen Bar, the shoyu broth had none of the delicate balance of saltiness and umami that one would expect, but instead tasted just like any $1 shoyu-flavoured instant noodle seasoning, except strongly diluted with water so that it was even worse. Instead of richly marbled chashu that's sliced to 0.5 mm thick and melts in your mouth, they give you... stringy pork monoliths that are rock hard, tasteless, and take away all the moisture in your mouth so as to scrub against your tongue like sandpaper.   Well, at least they give you quite a large quantity of meat, so they've got that going for them. The server was quite nice too. It is deplorable indeed that many Pittsburghers will never get to try the real delicacy that is ramen.",

    "text": "Nom nom. Good Asian food is hard to come by in this city and this was definitely a contender. A large bowl will feed two if you're hungry and it'll feed four if you just want something light.  VENUE: Located on cute and quaint little Squirrel Hill, this place is cozy and small. Perfect for an intimate date, or a casual bite with a small group of friends. My friends and I came around dinner time and the ambience was nice. The quiet hustle and bustle of the kitchen didn't detract from the overall calm atmosphere. Lighting (as with many restaurants around dinner) was dim and we were seated at a high top table large enough to seat 10. There were four of us so we shared it with two other parties. There was enough space in between the groups that it didn't feel like we were invading someone else's group nor did we feel encroached upon. I'd say most of the quietness came from the fact that everyone seemed to be enjoying their ramen too much to talk.  FOOD: My friends and I split a large bowl of Spicy Veggie Ramen w/Shoyu broth. We added wontons, egg, shrimp, and tofu. It was DELICIOUS. The soup was nice and flavorful and noodles were perfectly cooked. Veggies were seasoned well. Tofu didn't fall apart, the egg was hardboiled, and wontons had a good amount of meat in them. Shrimp was good (they leave the tail for those of you like to eat every bit of it), and the whole thing gave me just enough warmth the brave the cold that night. I wish  it was spicier (as I am a self-proclaimed chili head) but for those of you who just want a little kick, this is a good pick.  SERVICE: As is the case with all my friends, when we congregate sometimes we get a bit obnoxious. I think we were having a little too much fun picking and choosing from the menu and we were laughing quite a bit. We were a bit ridiculous with our order (in terms of how we wanted it to be split/served) but our server was extremely patient and helpful. The owner even recognized us as having just come from his other establishment, Rose Tea Cafe, and was even more accomodating.   The bowl came out to be maybe $15? and was an excellent choice (both in taste and portion) for a hankering of something warm on a cold Pittsburgh night.",

The ramen noodle bowls are delicious, I had the curry ramen bowl and could overhear the table next to me ranting and raving about two entirely different dishes from the one I had before me... this place lived up to what I had heard about the taste, definitely not your average ramen packet and the prices are good for the value. Another pro, the service is friendly and prompt and you can get seated fairly quickly if you get in early enough on a Saturday night which is a bit of a transition into some of the downsides. The ramen bar (though in mentioning the name will plug another plus of byob) is certainly not a place that seems to encourage a good date night, the food comes fast, the check comes fast, they don't proactively ask about wanting dessert i.e. They want to clear tables, and the establishment is pretty small. They have one large table, but I'd encourage going elsewhere with a group. Also the appetizers seemed to be less than their forte (I tried the shrimp gyoza) so my suggestion go for a specialty ramen, with someone you want to spend a well served hour with, enjoy yourself and come back soon!",

The filling was tasty and had some depth but fell short of everyday noodles' dumplings. The gyoza were nicely browned and not dry.  For our entrees, we both chose the spicy shoyu broth (mine was vegetarian). The wonton men ramen ($10) broth was good but one dimensional. The noodles were unremarkable and the dumplings were more wrapper than filling. It was good but not great. I got the Midori ramen ($9.5) - vegetarian. It was okay, the vegetables seemed fresh - especially the broccoli. I added tofu for $1 which they added generously.   The vegetarian soup was not significantly better than a packaged ramen that you could spruce up on your own with fresh ingredients. But the portions were large - a good deal for the price.   Food was average, service was good, the place was a little noisy for being half-empty.",

We were told the gyoza are handmade there and they were fried to perfection. The tan tan men was delicious: really nice balance of sweet, spicy, salty, and sour. However, if you're sensitive to spice, this might be a bit too spicy. Although the gyoza and tan tan men were delicious, the spicy miso ramen ramen left a lot to be desired. The broth wasn't very spicy and it was quite one-dimensional. All in all, I'd come back mostly for the tan tan men :)",

It not only had wontons but came with several large pieces of pork which I was pleasantly surprised. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were a nice texture. I also ordered a Japanese Curry Beef to go. The curry was very flavorful with lots of pieces of beef and not too many onions which is nice. I dislike curry with too many onions.   The second time I came here I ordered the Mabo Ramen which is essentially Mapo Tofu with Ramen. I expected it to come out more like a sauce but it came out as a soup instead. It was okay. Not as good as the Wonton one but decent.  The third time I came, I was disappointed. It was a few weeks after their grand opening so I guess they became less attentive to the food. I ordered the Midori Yasai Ramen. It was basically just ramen topped with a bunch of boiled vegetables. Not much flavor to it. What disappointed me the most were the noodles. They came out extremely soft and way too soggy. Overcooked noodles are very off-putting.",

Ramen at Ramen Bar, unfortunately, is not like the ramen I had in Japan. It's not bad though.  I had a Curry Ramen bowl and I liked the flavor. Why I'm not rating this place higher is because the noodles don't taste that special. They are sort of like normal instant ramen noodles. I'd really like to see them kick up their noodle game. There was also just a lot of liquid in my bowl. It gives the illusion that you get a huge bowl of food, but most of it was soup. Everyone said they had more than enough and some people were taking food home, but somehow I demolished my bowl and wasn't stuffed. Did I get less food than the others or maybe I was just hungry that day?  I came with five others though and I thought it was a good place for lunch with a small group.

First, they messed up the order, which is fine... mistakes happen.  They're human too.  The ramen with the vegetable broth was the most flavorful, compared to the spicy and regular shoyu, but it still wasn't amazing.  The regular shoyu was so bland and tasteless.  Even Swanson's chicken stock has more flavor than it.  The spicy shoyu was not spicy at all.  I feel so terrible saying this, given that it seems like a mom-pop shop, but the ramen (at least the one we had) were nothing but bowls of disappointment.  On a brighter note, I did like their takoyaki appetizer.  It's fried balls of octopus topped with bonito flakes and nori.  Correction:  it's supposed to come with nori, but I guess they forgot it in our order.    Service was OK.  It met the minimum requirements which is fine by me, minus the almost dropping the ramen on people. Our server also wasn't quite the whipper snapper.",

In a town lacking ramen options, Ramen Bar fills the void as a modernized ramen restaurant. Yelpers looking for a solely traditional experience may want to look elsewhere, as RB's ramen selection includes both traditional favorites and fusion-influenced bowls (Curry, Tom Yum, Kimchi, etc. flavors). Additionally, there are a number of vegetarian and vegan options.  I settled on the seafood Tantan-men, which came highly recommended. The heap of shrimp, scallops, mussels, and squid were excellent, but the True winner was the broth. Rich, complex, savory, and the perfect amount of spice. I felt compelled to sip to the bottom.  Restaurant-wise: comfortably dim-lit, casual atmosphere, and a very cool juxtaposition of wall-art and urban photography, which completes the modern feel. The waitstaff was very helpful, attentive, and polite.  Overall, I'd say Ramen Bar stacks up nicely compared to more well-known, modern ramen restaurants out on the coasts. I can't wait to return and try other options...and maybe take home some more Tantan-men too :D",

The shoyu ramen is great, but I would not recommend the pork version since the meat itself is quite bland.    The black pepper noodles, however, are beyond amazing.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who likes moderate spice.    Ramen Bar is one of the things I miss most about living in Pittsburgh.    Unfortunately though, I'm not sure that they make their own noodles.  If this is True, then it would be my only criticism.  Overall, Ramen Bar is superior to Everyday Noodles, which is across the street.  Although Everyday Noodles has better vegetable dumplings, makes their own noodles, and is set up in a really cool way that allows customers to see the noodles being made, everything else is more flavorful at Ramen Bar.",

Can be a bit crowded at times, but have never had to wait too long. I tend to get the spicy garlic ramen and add a hard boiled egg. Good spot for a group or casual date night. Portions are generally large so anticipate taking some home.",

The soft eggs were cooked correctly each time and the noodles were quite delicious.   Never been to Japan, but from all of the accounts from friend who have been, I feel I have at least a minimal grasp on how proper ramen should qualify.   If you like noodles, go here.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to check this restaurant out for awhile now and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I did a build your own bowl with spicy shoyu broth and the ramen ramen recipe. I added baby corn and egg to this and asked for additional spicy paste to put in the ramen. When I received my order I was surprised (in a good way) at how large the bowl and meal were. It came out piping hot, which I appreciated. I hate tepid, lukewarm soup. The ingredients within my bowl were all blended well and I could get a bite of everything each time. I thought the additional baby corn portion was quite substantial and paying the additional amount for it was worth it. I personally think the ramen should already come with an egg and customers shouldn't be charged extra for it since there isn't a whole lot of protein within the bowl, but oh well. As for the taste, it was delicious. The ramen was hearty and filling. My broth was lighter than my date's miso broth. I preferred mine to his. The only thing that was a little difficult was eating the ramen with chopsticks and the large spoon, but I think this makes the experience and slows down your eating speed so that you really can enjoy the ramen. Lastly, we had also ordered edamame as an appetizer and it was good. I also thought the service was normal, nothing exceptional. I also believe the restaurant if BYOB. We didn't know this before coming in.",

    "text": "I decided to head to the Ramen Bar after work because it has been on my \"must try\" list of restaurants in Squirrel Hill. I was a bit apprehensive about ordering Ramen noodles for 9-11 dollars. I mean really, they are .25 cents at the store! But I decided to forgo my penny pinching ways and just go to the Ramen Bar.   When I walked in the host station was in the back of the restaurant, odd, but not off putting in any way. I walked toward it and the one server/host asked me, with a bit of a weird tone, what I needed. Now, maybe she meant take out or dine in, but that question was just a bit odd to me. I told her that I wanted to sit down and eat, and that it was just me and my other party was on their way. She told me to sit anywhere.   I sat and looked over the menu. Simple and to the point. I ordered some pot stickers and the Curry Ramen. The pot stickers were amazing. Such a great flavor, the perfect combination of a sweet and meaty taste. They came six to an order and they were a big six.   The Curry Ramen was very good. The broth was delicious even if I was expecting it to be a little spicier. But while it was not spicy it was still flavorful. The pork was done perfectly and plenty of it in the bowl! No skimping around here! The vegetables were done so they still had shape and texture to them but still cooked thoroughly. I almost ate my entire bowl! It was very filling and really a good time.  The food was good, don't get me wrong, but would I make it a regular spot to go back to? No probably not. But would I go again? Yes, I would.  .",

I will admit, this was only my second go with the legit noodle experience, but I was with someone who lived in Japan for three years and was impressed with the authenticity.  There were three of us and we each tried a different kind (Chashu Ramen & Negi Ramen both with the miso broth and the specialty Kimchi Ramen) with a couple add-on's of egg and bamboo shoots.  Was this the best broth I have ever tasted? No. But was it delicious, full of flavor, and more than enough food to fill me up? Yes!  I actually couldn't finish my bowl and the waiter was nice enough to separate my noodles and broth when he packaged up the leftovers so they wouldn't get mushy.  If nothing else, I don't know how anyone could not find enjoyment out of slurping up the noodles with their chopsticks.  I will definitely be back here, especially in the cold winter months!",

The curry ramen smelled somewhat decent and seemed to be the best option at the table but the overall consensus was that everything completely lacked flavor. The meat in the ramen was fatty and chewy. The service was friendly but not the fastest which was not the fault of the waiter. There appeared to be only one or two waiters in the place and maybe a busser here or there. We had reservations but waited about 30 minutes. No one took our drink order, although they don't serve alcohol so that wasn't a huge deal. I will say the egg roll appetizers were delicious but it was so small! We got 4 egg rolls that were a quarter of the size of a normal egg roll. To sum it up, thumbs down, won't go back, won't recommend.",
