The specials they offered on their website were excellent and I will consider them highly again the next time I need pizza in that area, and their gluten free pies are intriguing enough that I must test one soon.",

    "text": "Please order the pizza and cheesy bread, PLEASE DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ELSE. I am a frequent customer of Giovanni's for their good pizza, cheesy bread, and also subs. I chose to eat in and try their Italian food (full menu) twice recently. There were clearly different chefs. The first time was pretty average- seafood pasta. Fresh seafood and homemade sauce.  I returned tonight to discover that tonight's chef \"the parsley assassin\" has reinterpreted the menu.  To start our salads had a weird red powder all over it (old bay seasoning?). The bread and dipping oil was ruined by an extra heavy dose of parsley flakes. Side of pasta? Covered in parsley.... Side of mixed veggies? Covered in parsley.... My meal was destroyed by the same solid parsley layer too thick to avoid. Her meal, Chicken Frenchese - was completely wrong - this supposed to be a meal of lightly breaded chicken in a white wine sauce, with mixed veggies (per their menu, my experience, and a google search). What they served was a breaded chicken breast smothered in spinach, olives, red peppers and the much maligned parsley- in an ocean of red colored olive juice (might have been vodka sauce). It was unpleasant at best. We asked the waitress twice if it was the correct dish and she pointed to the menu and explained to me that olives, spinach and peppers are vegetables......... Dessert was fair, server unable to explain what \"cheese twists\" are, they turned out to be pizza dough filled with cream cheese.  I left two nearly full meals on the table. No need for take-out containers tonight.   Based on these experiences, I will not return. Please order the pizza, cheesy bread and subs BUT I WARN YOU - if you try anything else you may not return as well......",

I used to have much better service, but everything is going downhill.  I was watching my two kids by myself, and we were all looking forward to an awesome night, movies and pizza, and it was ruined. It is really sad.  I dont want to stop ordering from them, but I dont know what else to do.  The kicker is when trying to submit feedback online, the page doesnt work, so you cant even email them. I think that speaks volumes. I then tried to call them to complain, and no one picked up.  I wish someone would reach out to me, because i cant reach out to them!",

You can order online and they even have an app for your phone (although it never worked for me, but then again I am totally inept with smartphone technology).  We always get the large pizza (1 topping), cheesy bread and soda online special.  Get extra marinara because you will want to drink this stuff!  They really cheese up the pizza (and this is coming from a cheese lover), so last time I asked my husband if I should order it with light cheese and he looked at me like I had two heads.  Just be prepared, first timers, before you order extra cheese.  This is cheesy, greasy salty pizza goodness, folks, so if you're counting your weight watcher points, then this place is probably not the best option for you.",

Service is always quick, friendly and accurate.

When he did arrive I asked him if he had trouble finding it or was he busy and he said \"no, I had another order\". So, when we finally got the food, the hoagie was burnt AND cold, the salad was warm and wilted (and very very small for $3.99), lettuce was also slightly browned, and the wings were also WAY overcooked, cold, and nasty brown inside. The blue cheese they serve is just ranch with blue cheese mixed in. Seriously if you make your own ranch, it's not hard to make your own REAL blue cheese, not that ranch-mixed crap.

We were severely disappointed. My girlfriend tried the buffalo chicken salad with french fries. I ordered penne noodles with marinara sauce. We decided to share an order of cheese bread twists and a slice of cheesecake. My girlfriend's salad was basically a few shreds of iceberg lettuce slathered in mediocre, overly-spicy buffalo sauce. The chicken and fries were cold. The pasta was nice and hot, but I found the marina sauce to taste bland and ketchup-ish, almost like they had dumped a cup of corn syrup in the mix. It was freaky. I was surprised that the cheese bread thing was so highly rated because ours was doughy, cold, and we weren't even sure if cheese was involved. The marinara dipping sauce was the same as what was on my pasta- ketchup-y, sharp, and basically flavorless. The cheesecake was actually pretty good, flavor-wise. Perfectly sweet. However, the consistency was almost identical to that of a half-melted tub of frosting. The whole thing was a gooey mess, spilling over the sides of the crust. Our experience was incredibly disappointing and we ended up throwing most of the food away. I could have set aflame forty bucks and felt about the same. That being said, we didn't even try pizza. Maybe that's better, but we won't be taking the risk to find out.",

The Food: We ordered a medium bacon and meatball and a grilled chicken salad.  The Salad: The salad was extremely underwhelming, warm, wilted lettuce and so little grilled chicken.  I like a nice crisp, cold salad, and if I ask for chicken I expect more than 4 or 5 small chicken strips.  The Pizza:  I really enjoyed the crust on this pizza, better than most I have had in Pittsburgh, but the sauce was awful.  The sauce was plentiful, which is a plus, but it was extremely sweet, almost like eating candy.  There is enough cheese on the pizza, IMO just the right amount.  The big junks of meatball were pretty good, not great, but good, and as for the bacon, where is it?  I didn't see nor taste bacon except for a bite or two.  I will try Giovanni's again, but will stay away from the salad and may just go for traditional pepperoni as a topping next time.  I will also give their pasta a shot at some point!",

Pretty sure it was a pre-packaged frozen Gyro from the store, certainly not carved from a rotating spit. Not sure if all of Pittsburgh serves Gyros this way but it was a huge disappointment.

I cannot believe the amount of fat they put in their food. It makes it so heavy and drowns the other flavors. Their pasta dishes are simply noodles swimming in oil and sauce. As to their pizza, I would say you can find better pizza around Dormont. Although we do not like their food, I would say that the service is fast and the food is really warm. If you have not tried it, please do so and see it for yourself. Just remember that it is going to be very fatty...",

The first thing I noticed - the pepperoni was \"miniature\", as in, the diameter was maybe half of what I'm used to on a pizza. Is this a Pittsburgh thing? Maybe it is - I'm a recent Orlando transplant. Size didn't matter, in this case. The pizza was tasty, though I think it could have used a bit more sauce and cheese. -1 star for that, but it's probably largely personal preference.  The cheesy bread is as tasty as it is messy. It's REALLY cheesy.  Overall I'd definitely order from them again.",

My GF and I were in town for the New England debacle around Halloween and stayed at a nearby hotel. A quick Yelp check revealed that Giovanni's was THE place for pizza in the area. So we ordered. Then we ordered again.   After that, we order some more.  I can't rave enough about how large, delicious and filling their Texas Roadhouse Steak hoagies are. 15 minutes after calling in, my order arrived. I swear I heard carols of angels singing as I unwrapped the paper. Inside were steak, onion rings, provolone cheese, fried onions, peppers and mushrooms lathered in a spicy Santa Fe sauce.   The memory stimulates my salivary glands as I type.  Need I go on?  But don't stop reading now. Because the pizzas are also large and tasty: Freshly baked bread, excellent sauces and a wonderful assortment of meat toppings.   Corporate pizzeria conglomerates: Are you taking notes?  Because if the owners ever think to expand, Giovanni's will...well, eat your lunch.",

You are simply wasting your time and money if you're sitting there eating pizza that isn't Giovanni's.  They have the best deals I've ever heard of involving pizza, and you don't even need a pair of scissors to uncomfortably cut a coupon out, because by ordering online you save all that hassle.  For $19.99 you receive a whole 16 inch pizza, a box of DELICIOUS cheesy bread, and a 16 inch hoagie of your choice. I AM NOT SHITTING YOU. This is real.  And not to mention their pizza is amazing; it has a better taste than any other pizza in Dormont, BELIEVE IT!.   Their hoagies are insane though, maybe a little too much, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars (I got the texas roadhouse chicken which had chicken, onion rings, provolone cheese and peppers and mushrooms.)  So if you're trying to save yourself from having a brain aneurysm from looking at all the places to try pizza in Dormont, do yourself a favor and order Giovanni's.",

    "text": "I stopped by here last Sunday in order to pickup a pizza for my best friend and I to eat while watching football games.  I called out to Giovannis at around 11:50 and ordered an XL pepperoni pizza.  The guy on the other end of the phone confirmed I was picking it up in Dormont and then told me that it would be ready in around 20 minutes.  I arrived just over a half an hour later and my pizza was ready.  I didn't get to see too much of the inside but I noticed a dining room on the right whenever I entered and then the usual kitchen, soda cooler and pick up area on the left.  This pizza like all pizzas can be broken down into its three major components: cheese, crust and sauce.  My favorite part of this pizza was the sauce which had a little sweetness to it.  It's not nearly as sweet as the Giovannis on 6th street and that's ok as I think this sauce has it perfect.  There was a good amount of cheese on the pizza and it was decent enough although nothing special.  Last but not least was the crust which was a bit on the thicker side which I wasn't a huge fan of.  Since I also had pepperoni on this pizza I should probably talk about that as well.  The pepperoni it was sliced from was rather small and the edges of each one had curled up during cooking.  It tasted alright although I wish it had tasted better.  The bottom line for me is that I may stop by here again in the future.  While it wasn't the best pizza that I have ever had, it certainly is satisfactory and I did enjoy the sauce.",

Not only are they ripping people off by charging 13 dollars for a garbage sub with bread hard enough to chip your tooth, the service is awful. I was the only person in the place. It was my first time eating here and it's guaranteed my last. I could have went somewhere else and gotten the exact same sandwich for half the price, with better bread and service.

I've never eaten there, but lucky for me, this is on my boyfriend's way home from work so he can bring some delicious take-out home!   We've had a few different kinds and it has always been delicious. Crispy crust and perfectly cooked dough. My favorite was a combo of spinach, grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and feta cheese.   Not sure of their delivery radius within the city, but definitely check them out!",

    "text": "I've given Giovanni's about 7-10 chances over the course of 3 months, and I'm done.  The first time I got a specialty pizza from them it was amazing, and every time after that it's either been burnt or cold or covered in grease.  I might be able to come to terms with the long wait and the barely adequate customer service (at least with delivery and pick up, I've never sat down and eaten in the restaurant, though I have exchanged pleasantries with one of the waitresses and she seems friendly) if the food were consistently good, but it's not.  I've done call ahead pick-up, I've done order and wait for it pick up, and I've done delivery through their website.  The last time I ordered and picked up, they gave me the wrong pizza and I didn't realize it til I got home (my fault to a point, I probably should've looked at it).  It had onions and mushrooms on it, which I don't like, so it wasn't like I could just eat it anyway.  I called them and the guy asked: \"What you want me to do?  You want I deliver new pizza, you want credit, or you want pick up new pizza?\"  I feel I should note that I used to work as a server.  I realize mistakes happen.  Despite being hungry, tired, and frustrated, I made sure I was pleasant-- I did not insult anyone or raise my voice.  Based on my previous experience with delivery with them and the facts that I didn't want to wait 45 minutes for a new pizza and I'd already put $2 in the tip jar at the counter and didn't want to tip a delivery driver on top of that, I drove back and got a new (correct) pizza, which was smothered in cheese (I originally had asked for them to go easy on the cheese).    The guy apologized 3-4  times, which I appreciate, and it seemed that I got a lot of extra toppings on the new (correctly made) pizza, but I found it extremely disappointing that a handful of apologies was my only compensation for being an understanding customer (\"Hey man, it's cool, it's just a pizza, no one died,\" is something that I said.)    I feel I should've been offered a discount on my next order or offered a free dessert or breadsticks or something to compensate for the fact that I had to drive back to get my order correct.  Now, maybe I should've SAID that (\"Hey, uh, can I get a discount on my next order or get a free dessert or something?\"), but I don't feel that as a customer I should have to make suggestions.  I once witnessed a couple go in there and complain that they'd been waiting an hour for delivery.  They were handed their order free.  So I'm nice, drive back to pick up my order when they got it wrong, and I get compensated with a few extra pieces of chicken and some cheese that I didn't want on my new correct order?  I guess the squeaky wheel really does get the most grease.  Unfortunately for them, this was their last chance with me.  As I mentioned, out of anywhere from 7-10 chances over the course of 3 months, they've disappointed me more often than they've dazzled me.  As soon as I opened that box and got the wrong pizza I turned to my husband and said: \"That's it, we're never going to Giovanni's again.\"  With his mouth full of hoagie he asked:  \"Aww, are you sure?  Because this hoagie's really good,\" and I replied: \"Well, let me see if they can make it up to me,\" and they didn't.  So if you wanna roll the dice, you might have some amazing pizza, but you also might have to wait half an hour for something cold or burnt.  Best of luck in gambling at Giovanni's.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Giovanni's. But their pizza and ability to fulfill orders correctly are both terrible.  To date I'd only eaten Giovanni's when I was literally starving (our group was supposed to eat dinner at 6 and we ate at 10) so that's not really an accurate gauge of taste. But I remember it being a bit soggy, if generally good.  So I took a chance and ordered again tonight. I was dismayed from the moment I opened the door and the delivery guy handed me the wrong soda. The pizza itself was a bigger disappointment. First off, they forgot to add my favorite topping, so it was incomplete. Then then the center was SOGGY. It was bad.   The first slice tasted sweet but not in a good way. The sauce was almost like a sweet V8 and I couldn't figure out what I was tasting that was so unappealing. But it was too tomato-ey and didn't taste Italian at all.  The second slice got weirder. It tasted like buffalo wing sauce, and I soon realized that one half of the pizza had gotten some cross contamination (it was on one of the toppings) and I was literally eating Frank's Red Hot on my pizza. I like wings but I don't want a sweet pizza to taste like wings. Blech.  The third slice was the worst! It was highly greasy and so soggy that it broke in half - literally the center just disintegrated into the cardboard box. Gross. I was left scraping up pizza slop.   This was actually an inedible pizza, and I don't say that lightly. I had to throw it out. And I was taught never to waste anything. I'm never ordering from this place again.  Also, I should note that I went to the yoga place next door to Giovanni's last night for a class and when I walked in the place smelled like weed for a moment. I conferred with a friend in the class and she said she noticed that as well. We often smell pizza or hear the phone ring next door when our class is quiet, because the walls are a bit thin, and now I'm beginning to wonder if the weed smell was coming from Giovanni's too.",

Well, when I was told I basically couldn't have it at most places of course I NEEDED IT ASAP!  So now I've been on the quest to find the best gluten free pizza. This place definitely delivers (and to your house too, natch). While you can tell the crust is GF, I think it's pretty close to a Neapolitan style pizza crust. While I've had GF pizza that has a crispy crust, the center gets pretty mushy, and this was not the case.  But just as important are the toppings. i totally went for it with a buffalo chicken pizza and it was super tasty. I hate when they put like one piece of flimsy chicken or toppings, and they had big hunks of chicken with a tangy buffalo sauce.   The most surprising thing was that GF pizza never usually reheats well for leftovers. To my surprise, it tasted great still! I will most definitely add them to my list of good GF pizza options and glad to have them in my hood!",

A half is huge, more than enough packed with lots of different veggies and cheese on crisp bread. It's always ready and the young girls who work there are always so friendly. My one complaint...the one time I went there was a man who worked there who was clearly angry about something and he was yelling at two other male workers who seemed confused and like they didn't understand English very well. Now I don't know what happened, maybe they deserved it, but he stood there and berated them right in front of me and my friend for a good few minutes before even acknowledging his customers (us.) as someone who works in customer service, that's extremely unprofessional. My coworkers and I don't so much as talk loudly about our weekend plans with clients around, let alone yell at each other. I ended up having to eat really quickly this time because of the time we stood there waiting for this man to stop yelling at his employees right next to us (literally.....2 inched next to us.) I can't fault them for the food and the great service I've had on every other day....but let's say this. If I found out this man was the owner, id never go back.",

The salad was just okay. Mostly dated packaged salad greens and lots of iceberg lettuce chunks. The chicken was pre cooked and most likely sat in fridge all day, tastless and dry. That unfortunately was the highlight of the meal. Each pizza was horrible in its own way. Both shared a thick 1/2\" doughy crust. The bottom 1/4\" of which was burnt or near burnt. The next 1/4\" was raw and undercooked. The red sauce was nauseatingly sweet, and though I have thought it impossible, the pepperoni and sausage were cold, bland, and tasteless. Three boys aged 10-12 wouldn't eat it. The garlic butter sauce of the specialty pizza was no more than greasy flavorless blobs spewn between terrible crust and old chicken and spinach. I wish I was joking but truth be told, even my dog wouldn't eat the crust. Never again.",

They have an online ordering system that is easy to navigate and if you're part of the rewards program, can be a nice incentive.  Tonight, we ordered two medium cheese pizzas and 6 wings. Placed our order online at 515 pm with an estimated delivery of 559 pm. Knowing it's a Friday night, we didn't really mind that at 615, the order hadn't arrived yet.   At 630 pm, it finally came - incomplete. Only one medium pizza and the wings. The other pizza, missing.  Driver was apologetic and from the sound of it, was going to come right back with the second pizza. (We live close enough that we should have just gone to get it at this point!)   It's now 810 pm and after two phone calls, the second pizza finally arrived.  I did not expect anything free. In fact, we used a reward I had earned from spending over $100 on their food via their reward program.  But in both phone calls, not on apology, not one explanation as to what was going to happen or whether or not we'd actually be receiving the second pizza.    Even though it came, it wasn't as good as the first one. Very disappointed in the customer service and while I have had other positive experiences(hence, the loyalty program), I am not sure I will be ordering it again. Almost 3 hours to get a complete order just isn't right.",

    "text": "We love Giovanni's pizza.  The service here has always be excellent too!  We used to go here all the time, but then we went vegan...and therefore stopped ordering for a few years.  A few weeks ago on a whim, I emailed them and asked if they'd consider adding a vegan pizza option.  Much to my delight, they agreed!  We ordered our first vegan pizza last night and it was perfect!  How we missed their delicious bubbly crust and sweet tomato sauce!  The folks were also incredibly pleasant about our dietary restrictions and were sure to use separate tools for handling the pizza to avoid cross-contamination.  It was great and we are thrilled to be able to patronize our favorite local pizza shop again.  I don't know if the vegan pizza option will catch on, but we plan to continue ordering as long as they have it available.  Thanks!",

    "text": "If I could leave 0 stars I would.  I got 3 of their menus in my mailbox. I Live in Carnegie. I ordered on line and said 45 min for delivery. Ok. Np. And they deliver beer. $3 for a Stella, cool.  But they were 25 min late with my food and the 5 cheese pizza sucked! Horrible taste. And how can you make mozzarella sticks taste bad? They did. And the dipping sauce was water down pizza sauce.  Never going to order from them again!  And you shouldn't either.",
