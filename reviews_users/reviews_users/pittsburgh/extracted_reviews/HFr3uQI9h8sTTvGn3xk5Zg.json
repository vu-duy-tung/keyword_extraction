The staff were really friendly and clean! Since they cook everything right in front of you, I expected their shirts to be dirty. I was pleasantly surprised!   It was my first time eating a Philly cheese steak so it was hard for me to rate it. I didn't think they would give you such a long sandwich for only 6 dollars. I was full before I ate half the sub. The meat taste good but it was really dry. Are you suppose to put something else other than lettuce on a cheese steak sub? Overall, it was just okay.",

    "text": "I can eat a submarine just about any day of the week and it's probably a good thing that I don't live close by to \"Uncle Sam's,\" because I would.  I have only been here a few times, but have never been disappointed.  I have tried an array of sub shops in my time and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones.  The menu boasts a wide variety of subs and toppings including a Vegetarian menu, if you are in to that, but what separates it from most places is their emphasis on the Cheese Steak and their generous portions of meat.  Most shops around here tend to be a little lean on the meat and they more than compensate you for your dollar.  A regular does me just fine, but for those of a more carnivorous nature, they also have their Ultra menu which gives you double the meat if not more.  Another thing that i find refreshing is their Shoestring french fries, that they provide you with as a side if you dine in extra if you take out.  They also offer a Chicken Cheese Steak, which is also difficult to find in most shops.  Drink wise, they offer a variety of craft soda, craft beer, and of course your fountain.  Refills are extra.   Onto the Service.  In all honesty it can be a little hit or miss.  I have gone and have had great service where my food is ready and brought out immediately and there have been times where I have sat and waited a bit too long.  Having worked in food service I understand that it isn't perfect every time, but generally the wait is worth with it.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant is Cash Only.  If anyone is looking for a sub shop with character and delicious hoagies I would highly recommend it.  If subs aren't your thing the \"Burgatory\" and \"Panera Bread\" are next door.",

It is not mentioned anywhere as a policy but they will absolutely charge you the same amount of money and give you less food. Overall just a really bad experience.

If you are snobby and want your ass kissed...go to Burgatory next door where you will get an overpriced sandwich and some butt kissing.

As I recall they only take cash so, if you only have a card on you, rob a bank or something because you do not want to miss out on this. Cheese steaks are top-notch but if you get there earlier in the day try the provolone and egg sub as a special breakfast treat. Then go back for lunch.... and dinner.  Tip: You must add sweet potato fries to your order - I think this is actually a law in all 50 states.",

The Squirrel Hill one is cleaner but too often filled with children acting like wild animals. This location has less seating than the other two, but it's much cleaner and seems at least a decade newer. Not to mention, they have bottled beer! The prices aren't terrible, and they usually have decent options such as Dogfish, Bell's, and Magic Hat. Being able to crack a beer with my sandwich puts this Uncle Sam's head and shoulders above the others imo. It might get crowded during busy times, but I've only ever gone before a Monday night movie at the adjacent theater and it's been fine.",

You walk into a restaurant with cool decor, easy to read menu on the wall, order at the counter, and someone delivers your food. Cash only, which doesn't bother me... cash only is a great way to keep prices down (FYI that's the advantage for cash only joints).  I liked my Uncle Sam's Special and I really liked the thin cut fries. Maybe a little pricey, but the quality was good, so no complaints.  Since, it's an order at the counter joint... all the girl did was take our sub orders at the register, make change, then carry our subs 10 ft across the room, and plop them on the table. She wasn't very friendly either, may I add. You also clear your own table. They actually have a sign on each table telling you \"I'm not your mother, clean up after yourself\"... no joke. So what's with the tip jar? I think it's so chintzy to ask for tips in places like this. I hate that they put them right next to the cash register so you're obligated/pressured to drop something in with every employee watching you. Ugh...huge pet peeve of mine.  Overall, good place for a sub or Philly Cheese.",

I am tempted to try the chicken \"steak style\" sub the next time I go, my boyfriend is a big fan of it.

    "text": "This is a favorite spot for Chris and I. We call this our unofficial date night restaurant of choice. Whenever we go to the movies or grocery shopping somehow we make it to Uncle Sam's. The service is always fast and friendly and the food is great! I really cannot think of a better way to have a quick date than going to Uncle Sam's for a sub and a nice conversation.   The subs come with a side of fries. These fries are great. They are slightly larger than shoestrings but are fried in peanut oil so they are crunchy to the max. The great thing about Uncle Sam's is that they have extra condiments or toppings for the fries (and possibly subs) around the restaurant. I like to sprinkle a bit of the Cajun seasoning on my fries. But then sometimes if I am feeling spunky I will get the malted vinegar and dip/sprinkle that over my fries. AND THEN if I am feeling really exciting I will add both the Cajun and the vinegar. They also have seasoning salt and spicy mustard that people can pick from; and of course Heinz ketchup.   I always get the same thing each time I am there. Cheesesteak, extra tomatoes, extra onions, lettuce, mayo, and Italian dressing. I like a lot on my sub. Chris just gets the sub with nothing on it but mayo. He then adds ketchup later (gross).   The nice thing is that these subs are so big that usually I only eat half the sub. This means that for about $8.00 I can have dinner and lunch the next morning. When you need your sub packed up you bring the basket to the counter and they wrap it expertly so there is no mess and everything stays within the sub. I hate it when you get a box for a sandwich. Everything will fly around in the box making it hard to eat the next day. This wrapping is the best.   This time we were not that hungry and had a movie to get to so we split a sub. Because Chris didn't want any of my usual toppings they put all of my extras on the side in a little toppings boat so both of us could eat what we wanted and no one felt left out/lacking. I thought that this was great customer service. I really appreciated it.   I suggest everyone go and try out their subs. You will not be disappointed. Also, try new things and tell me what your favorite other subs are! Maybe I will expand and try something new!",

    "text": "First time in today. Asked about the \"Italian Tuna Sub\" on the \"From the Grill\" menu. Was told it's not grilled or toasted but is a tuna base with no mayo. OK... Are the other toppings for the \"From the Grill\" menu items included? Yes. OK... One order of a tuna with cheese to go. $10 + $1 tip and as I watch the guy make my sandwich (fully unobstructed view of the prep area from the pick-up counter), I see that this sandwich is actually bread, handfuls of shredded lettuce, and raw tuna emptied directly from the cans. Bread, raw tuna, lettuce. All while continually wiping the counter with a filthy rag and returning to handling my order repeatedly after using this rag.  Rather than go through the hassle of canceling my order and asking for a refund from the surly teenager working the register (never mind that I pre-tipped on this service!), I took my order (filthy rag handled bread, raw tuna, and lettuce) and promptly disposed of it outside. Will never, ever return to this chain.  It's not Italian, or grilled, or even hygienic, and it's certainly not good!!!",

I reccomend Uncle Sam's and stop by often. The employees are nice and friendly also. The restaurant could use some updating and cleaning, but it's got character and quality.",

Also always need to double check the bag that they remember the fires and cheese sauce but they don't forget to charge you for them. So annoying.",

    "text": "Any business with the word \"sub\" in the title is going to scare me. Only because Subway has really ruined my idea of a sub. I hate Subway. Like, I can't even walk by a Subway and not shudder. So just by default I avoid anything with sub in the title. Sorry Uncle Sam's.  But Burgatory was closed for a watermain break and that was the only viable option. I'm really glad it was though, because it really was delicious. Honestly, it was very very good. I ordered the portobello sandwich, with melted swiss cheese and caramelized onions. It was funny because I asked for wheat bread (which Subway does have!!) and they said \"we only serve white.\" Well, okay. No avoiding the processed flour here friends!  But whatever, it was a darn good sandwich and I'm into it!",

    "text": "I've eaten at Uncle Sam's for over 10 years between all of their Pittsburgh locations, almost exclusively eating in for lunch. Their subs are good, their fries are good, the wait can be a little long.  I don't mind them being cash only. I don't mind the unpleasant cashiers.  I mind not getting French fries with my to go order and not having a reason behind it other than its your \"policy.\" Especially when it costs the same price. If it's because of soggy fries, here's your solution, leave the top of the bag open.  If I pay the same amount you could at least tell me why I can't have the fries. And when I ask (in a sarcastic manner) that if I would've said \"for here\" taken one bite and asked you to wrap it up I wasn't asking for an honest answer I was pointing out how dumb this policy is.",
