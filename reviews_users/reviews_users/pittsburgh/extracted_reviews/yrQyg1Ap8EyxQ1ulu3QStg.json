    "text": "When I read in the Post-Gazette that Chev and Rachel's was opening not 5 minutes from where I work overnights, I could not be more excited.  All I needed to do was convince my co-workers to give it a try...which really wasn't difficult.  At 7am on a winter morning the store front that is Chev and Rachel's is like a bacon calling me home.  Uh, I mean beacon.  The owner, there by himself for the first hour or so, was happy to greet us.  Upon sitting down there were a couple little things I noticed that impressed me.  First, under my utencils was not one, not two, but instead a generous pile of napkins.  Things can get messy when it comes to me and food and I like when a restaurant lets me be liberal with my napkin usage.  The second thing I noticed, which has nothing to do with the food, was a bag of pet friendly ice melt inside the door.  As a pet owner, it's nice to see a business owner who cares like that.  Especially when I saw several dogs walk by the door.  The menu isn't all that adventurous but what they do offer is well executed.  The chocolate chip pancakes are massive.  My Breakfast Bowl was a delicious mixture of potatoes, eggs, onions, cheese and bacon with some Mancini's toast added.  The prices were reasonable (my breakfast bowl plus side of toast was under $10 with tip) but be advised they are cash only and the dining room is very small.  Still, if you can squeeze your way in, give it a try.  My one star deduction is only because, as David B pointed out, they need to turn on the grill hood.  I don't mind smelling like the diner itself, but not when the diner smells like it might be on fire.  Perhaps during warmer weather when the doors can be left open that will help.  Until then, I'll give it another go.",

I knew exactly what to expect with this Emsworth brunch place (as Emsworth and Bellvue are not necessarily 'brunch' type of places) and it lived up to my expectations.  The place is settled in a neighborhood and has street parking out front. A counter and a few small tables make it the type of place where you feel like the entire restaurant could start having a conversation at any moment. During brunch, an older gentleman wondered into the store with fresh herb plants to give (sell?) to the owner. Fit in perfectly with the friendly feel.  Staff was welcomeing and seemed like they'd been waitressing for decades. I opted for the breakfast bowl which was similar to the type of food I'd be able to make myself if I had the ingredients. The potatoes, cheese and bacon made for a hearty meal. Nothing especially crazy if you're looking for unique brunch food, but it's a great place to enjoy breakfast.",

My husband ordered the breakfast bowl with  ham and rye toast and deemed it \"just ok.\" I had the basic breakfast bowl and bacon chocolate chip pancakes.  Let me tell you about those pancakes.  Wow.  If I'd only ordered those, I might have given this place five stars. Unfortunately the breakfast bowls were 3-4 star worthy...so I'm going with 4 overall.

Bacon was the perfect amount of crispy, the toast was nicely done. I appreciated the home fries, not a drop of grease to be had! The scrambled eggs however were brown and a little bit dry.  We both had sodas to drink and they are a very large size. The waitress (owner?) kept us refilled. She kept incredibly busy with prepping and such. Her husband (I believe?) was doing the cooking. Both friendly, talkative people. Prices are right on the mark too.  It's nice to have something new and local and different to us. But be warned, they close at 1:30!",

My brother had chocolate chip pancakes. I had buttermilk pancakes and bacon.   Pancakes are fluffy, gigantic and just a touch sweet. Everyone loved their choices. Delicious. Really reasonable prices. Owner was super friendly.   Can't wait to go back!",

From the outside it looks a bit run down. The inside is on the small side has maybe enough room for 20 people. Dont let that detract you as the service is totally amazing. I had 2 eggs over easy with bacon and home fries and the food was super great and cooked perfectly. Chev & rachels is definitely the place to go and I recommend it 100%. You can be sure I will be going there a lot in the future. Only draw back if you want to consider it a drawback is they only take cash. No big deal to me but remember to bring cash or you won't be able to get the best breakfast ever.",

Reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and made it a very enjoyable experience. I loved the small town diner feel. I am only giving it 4 stars because nothing stood out to me as \"wow.\" They don't have a parking lot so you will have to park on the street but there were a lot of open spots when we went. They also have the option of outdoor seating.",

The prices are reasonably cheap I feel for the portion. I don't have anything bad to say about the food, we just ordered pancakes, one for each of us. However, it was double the size I thought it was going to be and couldn't finish it all, but gave my best attempt (probably 2/3 of the way eaten). My boyfriend watched as the waitress took my plate and overheard her and the cook mention about how much of a waste I was being and gave us slight glares. I was not impressed and didn't feel welcome, just because I couldn't finish my meal, that I paid for? I understand that wasting food isn't the best, but to give me the third degree because I couldn't finish it? Not cool. Probably won't be returning.",

Also worth noting that our coffee was free with the Yelp check-in offer.  My wife's eggs were fine as were both our orders of Mancini's toast. And the gentleman who waited on us was friendly and fast. But my omelet was not very good at all.  You can see the from the picture that it didn't even look that great, almost like it was covered in pancake batter.   It was disappointing because we like supporting small, local, family-run diners like Chev and Rachel's. Maybe we just caught them on a bad day.",

Always a solid group of regulars at counter and tables are hard to come by but if you have to wait a few minutes no big deal.  Very friendly staff.  Would recommend to anyone who's even thinking about going to Eat N Park.  Step out and try a real homemade breakfast !!!",

We arrived mid morning, so we were between breakfast & lunch & it was not crowded. Just one other couple that we came to find out was also waiting for their dog to be done at PVSEC (vets). I ordered eggs & bacon & one pancake & my husband ordered a burger. We were chatting with one of the gentleman ( I think he may have been the owner) and telling him about dieting & low carbs etc, he shared that he lost a lot of weight doing Keto. We told him we were splurging & having whatever to eat & he surprised us with a slice of Mancini's bread toasted with butter. Oh my, it was the best thing ever! He made our day with the toast, great food, and conversation. I'm not from that area, but if you're looking for a cool place for a bite to eat, this is it!",

First it's one of those places where you can't tell who the owner is because everyone is so kind and customer focused. - it's small and quaint. 22 chairs as my 7 year old counted.  My husband and I had eggs over medium, meat potatoes and Mancini toast for $6.00. the kids had pancakes.  The pancakes were dense and hearty- so if you are hungry 2 will fill you up for $4.00.   So I'm a stickler for my carbs. I love the mancinis toast. If a diner doesn't have it, I don't go.  And the POTATOES guys.  They were cooked all the way through. And dark and crunchy on the outside.  No ketchup needed.   It's cash only- but for some reason most great diners are.  Mismatched mugs, great coffee, warm smiles.  I'll be back.",
