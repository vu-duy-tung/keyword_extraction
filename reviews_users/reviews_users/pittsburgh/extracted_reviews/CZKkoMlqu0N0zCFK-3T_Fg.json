    "text": "From the meat and cheese plate, which I included lamb salami (YUM!), to the heavenly bread basket--I could eat a meal of the cream cheese chive biscuits alone--to my husband's swordfish, octopus, mushroom gnocchi dish and my duck two ways--peppery breast and in-house sausage--with orange glazed carrots and celery root and potato gratin...our meal was among the top few in Pittsburgh that are worth the price. The ingredients were clearly fresh; and, the dishes were thoughtfully, beautifully, and masterfully prepared. And, if we had saved room for dessert, I would have had to restrain myself from ordering everything on the menu.  I would say that I felt, while the beer list is affordable and accessible, I found the wine list to be a bit overpriced in light of the specific wines that are available. The ambiance of the dining room is comfortable and welcoming. All things considered, we will definitely be back again and will absolutely recommend Spoon to others!",

    "text": "Excellent first experience! We will definitely return. Having been to BRGR next door several times, it was time to try Spoon. I made a reservation for 6 on Open Table and the moment our party walked in, they had a nice, large, comfortable table ready to go. The decor is modern and fancy, yet warm and inviting. The staff were all very attentive, yet still came with some personality (often a swing-and-miss in fine dining). Our server was also fantastic with one of our guests requests for alcohol-free cocktails and another guest's allergy to dairy (great coordination between chef, bartender, and waiter).   Like most fine dining restaurants, the prices were high and the portions not huge, but compared to several other similar establishments nearby, the prices were actually more fair and the portions comparable, if not slightly larger.   Aside from the stellar service and enjoyable atmosphere... everything was delicious. Absolutely delicious. 5 stars well deserved in comparison to other Pittsburgh fine dining spots.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time during restaurant week.  I saw the menu and I was sold on the pork belly.  I just love pork belly dishes.  My friend and I both got the sangria which we both agreed were pretty good and refreshing.  The bread basket from breadworks was a great way to start.  I loved the one with the cheese inside.  I commend the restaurant for going against just serving plain bread and giving a variety and a good one at that.  It adds to their thoughtfulness and for the atmosphere of the place, I can tell that matters.  Speaking of atmosphere, I loved it!  It is a small place but it's like a comfy house. I liked how there's a fireplace with a place to lounge if you're just there for drinks.  The bacon and egg dish was good.  Definitely needed the 5 min egg to add the creamy component to the dish as my pork belly was a litle dry.  I'm assuming it was overcooked? My fiance had the celery soup, and it was really good!  For entree, I had the roasted pork.  It was pretty fancy how the server set the dish on the table and then poured the apple aus jus on top.  The pork was cooked perfectly on this dish and I liked the prierogies served with it.  My fiance liked the cassoulet, but the presentation wasn't that great on that one. It just looked like beans on the bottom with chunks of sausage.  Now the highlight of the meal was the dessert.  All of us got the spoon bar and all agreed it was amazing!  It's a chocolate mousse with nouggat sprinkled on top (which the server said was only made in the restaurant) and then it had a layer of cheesecake.  It was a good portion to satisfy the sweet tooth, but I really could have some more. Haha.  Pretty good first time experience.  I did wish the price for restaurant week would've been a little lower bc we basicalt saved about $3 per person, so one of our friends just ordered off the regular menu.",

    "text": "I was treated to a birthday dinner at Spoon recently by my doting husband, and I think I've found what is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Halfway through dinner I wondered aloud whether we had been magically transported to New York or Chicago. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.   We had made a reservation, but, it being a Tuesday night, we could have walked in off the street, it was that quiet. We had our choice of tables, and chose one in the back, which gave us both a nice spot by the window and comfy banquet seating. We both opted for the tasting menu, which is half size portions of items from the regular menu, and offered many of the things we were interested in trying. The amuse bouche was a spring pea soup that I had wanted to try from the menu, and it was delicious; a thick puree of fresh tasting peas garnished with pickled red onion, Surryano ham (the American version of Spain's Serrano ham), a puree of spicy carrot and tarragon creme fraiche. An excellent soup which had me wanting more. The first course was Korean roasted pork with crispy fried oysters, homemade kimchi and a spicy aioli, served with lettuce for wrapping. Again, I could have just kept eating. The flavors were strong and rich, and each component both stood on its own and blended deliciously with the whole. Great cooking. The next course was the gorgonzola bleu cheese souffle with braised artichokes, roasted red pepper, asparagus, frisee, arugula, with a honey and white balsamic vinaigrette. They sliced this in half for the tasting. It was an exceptionally good souffle, though they might have streamlined the garnishes. My only complaint is that sometimes the chef went a little overboard with items on the plate. The cooking was well executed, but sometimes simpler is better. Anyway, on to the halibut, which also did not disappoint. Pan seared and served with a seafood sausage (delicious), asparagus, poached oysters (perfection) and buerre blanc. The highlight of the evening. The duo of veal...loin and sweetbreads with a potato and cauliflower gratin, was the only dish that fell a little flat. The veal itself had very little flavor, but the gratin was very good. And then I got my chocolate cake for dessert, which is always what I want on my birthday! Service was attentive, friendly and polished, and she recommended a wine that was so good I wrote the name down before leaving. This is the best food I've had yet in the 'Burgh, and I'll be back.",

A meal here will be of quality but won't change your life.  The ambiance of Spoon is quite cute -- warm lighting, lounge-type feel. Good place to go for a quieter dinner where you can have more discussion than some other louder places.  The bread basket everyone is raving about really is *that* good. We had two. Our waitress was really nice and made dinner seem like an extraordinary event. I had the duck breast. It was a little chewier than I thought it should be, but nonetheless, flavorful. The au gratin potatoes served with it were delicious. The strawberry pineapple sorbet was a delicious end to the meal. They have a fixed price menu for $38 during the weekdays. We didn't opt for that, but our bills still came out around that price including dessert, so it ended up working out as really reasonably priced for the atmosphere.",

    "text": "Let me tell you something about Spoon....  It doesn't really matter what I order as long as they keep giving me those cheese-filled cheese breads in the bread basket. Those things are to DIE for.   To back track a bit on what I said... it probably also doesn't matter what I order, since they all sound, look, and taste good.. from the orders we've made.  Having ordered the scallops and pork two ways (there are quite a few items on the menu that are \"two ways\"... and there's even a dessert item that was \"three ways\"), I was a little surprised by the negative space on my square plate (and most people would solve that by giving you a smaller plate), but it seems they do it for the presentation. Tender and delicious.. and just enough for me. I loved my entree (and the second helping of cheese-filled cheese breads they brought by... mmmm).  Even with a bit of dim lighting (which, you know, I'm not too hot about if it gets in the way of my food oggling), I actually found it a little cozy with good food, good company, drinks, and soft music. The service was excellent. I really liked our server, who answered to our whims (more cheese-filled bread, please!). I also feel guilty in saying that we probably overstayed our welcome. (We were there past closing, and I think the host was the only one left... by the time we took our leave.) They never rushed us with anything or asked us to leave, however.   Entrees range about $20-$40 per plate... so, all told, it's either all for a nice date.. or for a more upscale night out with a few friends at a fairly comfortable spot (with some cheese-filled cheese bread).  Aside from the cost, which may burn holes through pockets if I were to ever become a regular (but, first, I'd have to live there)... the only other problem seems to be trying to find street parking at night.  PS. o-m-g. This marks my 200th review. :o It's awesome to find I'm reviewing a place I hearted for a mile marker.",

We started off the night with the bread basket.  I was excited about this from reading the other reviews.  Holy moly.... were they right.  The cornbread and biscuit with hints of cream cheese were mind blowing.  They asked if we'd like some more bread, and it was hard to say no.  We managed to stay on track and not ruin our appetite for our dinners though :)    We decided to split the Gorgonzola and blue cheese souffle for an appetizer.  I was between this and the \"asparagus two ways,\" but I'm happy we stuck with our first choice.  The souffle was savory and the perfect consistency.  It was served with a small side of greens, which paired perfectly with the other flavors.    For our entrees, I chose the Arctic Char, while my boyfriend went with the chicken and duck sausage.  My fish was delicious, the skin was crispy and salty, and the little crab cake fritters were a nice compliment.  I had a few bites of the chicken and duck sausage, too.  OMG.... that sausage was the bomb.  It had a smokiness to it which left me wishing I'd ordered that dish.    To end the meal, we ordered a cheese and jam selection with port wine.  The various cheeses were fresh and well chosen.  The wine was sweet and the perfect ending to this meal.    Overall, this place exceeded my expectations.  We'll definitely be back!",

We didn't have a reservation, but we were able to get a table before the rush.    I had the foie gras appetizer and it was dynamite. I have had very few that I thought were better and it was presented in a range of forms. Well worth the cost for sure!  My wife decided not to get an appetizer, but loved the bread.  For dinner she had the beef two ways. A short rib over smashed potato with some gorgonzola I think and a sliced ribeye with some fresh veg and salad.  I had the pappardelle with rabbit ragu.  Both were really good. I liked mine better than hers but that was what hit the spot for me that night.  Service was very attentive, but not overly so.  Desert (which I am not much of a sweet eater) was a chocolate bark kind of thing. I tasted it and it was good. My wife loved it.

It was easily the most bizarre table set up that I have sat at in awhile as we were sat in a large corner table with my wife and I on one side and my sister and her husband on another.  The other two sides had no seats and were somewhat close to the tables next to us.  This meant that our servers would have issues serving the inner two seats all night.  To make matters even more confusing there were two 2-tops right next to us that we're not used the whole night that could have been easily pushed.  In the end, it didn't really change my opinion of Spoom but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Anyways, the inside of Spoon was very modern and clean looking.  I decided to start off my evening by having a Morgantown IPA while I looked over the menu.  It was nice that they at least had a semi local craft beer on it.  As I was looking over the menu I had the same problem with it that I did at home, none of the main entrees sounded appealing.  Perhaps this is why it had taken me over 6 years to dine at Spoon again.  It was then that my sister mentioned that she planned on getting a first and a second with no main.  Since the first and seconds both sounded much more interesting than the mains, our whole table followed suit.  I ended up ordering the blue cheese souffle for my first and then the shellfish tagliatelle for my second.  After only a short wait our firsts came out to the table.  My brother in law had ordered a Caesar salad and after they presented it to him they asked if they could take it back to the kitchen.  Since it was full romaine hearts we thought that they were maybe going to cut it up for him.  However, when the server came back it was stacked differently.  Upon querying her as to why it was taken back into the kitchen she explained that it had fallen and they wanted to make it looked good again.  I didn't see much of a difference but it is really nice to know that they pay that much attention to details.  My blue cheese souffle ended up being quite good.  The souffle itself was rich and creamy while the salad that surrounded it reminded me of a warm bacon spinach salad.  Once we had polished off our firsts the seconds came out.   My shellfish tagliatelle looked good whenever it came out and consisted of mussels, clams, rock shrimp, porcini mushrooms, Swiss chard, a pecorino foam and lemon butter all over top of the tagliatelle.  Overall I really enjoyed the taste of my dish, especially the shrimp and sauce.   I only wish that there had been more seafood in my dish as I think I had two mussels and two clams.  The only ingredient that I didn't really get was the pecorino foam which felt weird.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Spoon again in the future.  While the entrees didn't really appeal to me, I found quite a nice selection in both the Firsts and Seconds portion of the menu.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh has so many truly amazing restaurants, but this isn't one of them. Although the food was good, it wasn't great. If I'm paying $20+ for a plate, it shouldn't be out-shined by the bread basket (which was surprisingly the best part about the meal). My entree was the gnocchi and is was doused in oil. The wild boar paradelle had great flavor, but the pasta was too under, definitely not al dente.     Also, there are signature cocktails named \"gin tonic\" and \"Manhattan lux\" which was slightly confusing bc when we tried to order those two, the waitress thought we wanted and regular gin AND tonic and a regular Manhattan, not the cocktails from the menu. Not a bad thing, just a little confusing!!",

    "text": "Most amazing and delicious bread basket I have ever tasted at any restaurant. The bread basket comes with cornbread, cream cheese biscuits, and baguettes.  Cornbread - buttery with little bits of corn in it Cream cheese biscuits - flaky and melts in your mouth Baguette - everything you want in a baguette, crusty outside, fluffy inside  Three stars are for the bread basket, one for each type of bread.  Now for the actual food, I was not as impressed. I ordered the Lamb Pappardelle topped with a fried egg. It was just entirely too salty. The first bite was salty but bearable but as I ate more of it, the saltiness just overwhelmed any other flavor that was in the dish. The only thing that kept me eating is the fact that I hate wasting food. In the end I had to eat more bread and drink a lot of water to get rid of the saltiness.  The interior of the restaurant is very classy and the staff are friendly. It may be that just one time they over-salted the food. I would definitely come back though just for that bread basket.",

    "text": "This was my second time coming to Spoon. I felt the first experience was far better than last night. We had the blue cheese souffle as a starter which came out barely warm, and I found it to be an odd dish to eat without some sort of cracker or crunchy bread vessel. Texturally it was like just eating big mouthfuls of spreadable cheese by itself. It came with a side salad which didn't feel like the right accompaniment. I had the sweet potato gnocchi and the overwhelming flavor of the whole dish was salt and garlic without much else. The crunchy kale was the best part. My husband had the burger which was much more flavorful, but also over salted. Our favorite part of the meal was probably the French fries and the drinks. The service was good and everyone was very nice, but the food did not impress us last night, especially considering the prices and the fact that this city has so many great food options.",

Spoon is the kind of place you bring someone you want to impress, because the sommelier brings you a separate tiny glass for each wine you taste, and there's 10 waiters for every table. Honestly, I think that's where most of the money you spend on the food goes. Even before I went vegetarian, I found the food lackluster (adding foie gras to things doesn't automatically make them delicious), and now there's definitely nothing to write home about.  Also, a warning: we came here for a work dinner (~20 people), and they just kept opening more bottles of wine without asking. Be careful that you don't forget about your magically refilling glass!",

The others I was with got the grilled avocado, which they raved about, although I found it to not be particularly special. The steak was cooked just right (Pittsburgh grilled aka a quick seat on each side).  However, to my sadness, it was a bit cold and it sat on a plain green leaf. Part of the reason I ordered the steak was that it came with a foie gras deviled egg which I had never seen before!  It proved to be delicious, though heavy, so half of the egg was definitely enough.  Bonus points to the wait staff for being accommodating when half of my party dropped out. Definitely would be a great date place in the future.",

    "text": "We had a party of 8 with a toddler and two babies and the staff couldn't have been more gracious. Of course I made a reservation and they were prepared for us. They even had children's dishes not on the menu that our waiter offered us. The kids dishes actually looked really great when they came, which was RIGHT away, even before all of the appetizers were served, which worked really well with hungry little ones.   One member of our party got the smoked trout and grilled avocado as a app and mid-meal dish respectively. She very much enjoyed both, said the trout was the best she's had in a long while. I shared the large cheese plate with another member of our group. The waiter explained how each type of cheese told a story. The only story I got was YUM! The table side bread basket was a double YUM! I also had a taste of the foie gras and it had a interesting mix of sweet and savory flavor.   For my own meal I ordered the poached shellfish tartine, which I enjoyed, but my skirt was not blown up. It was a nice summertime dish, but towards the end the bread was soggy. My husband had the rabbit and pork sugo that I got to try and that was very tasty, however felt kind of heavy for late July. In fact I found the majority of the menu items read a bit heavy for this time of year. Of course, at 5 months pregnant my appetite goes from one extreme to the next, so even though I wasn't excited/impressed with the majority of the menu on the evening we were there, doesn't mean the same fare wouldn't entice me on another day.   On the flip side, the desserts were right up Momma's alley! I had the berries ice cream cake which I destroyed, tried the mocha ice cream from my husband's ordered, and finished the caramel ice cream my friend was too full to eat.    Overall, great service and the consideration for the kid/babies in our group was very much appreciated. The food had high, to mid-range points for me on that night, desserts off the chart. So yes, I would definitely go back in hopes of a change of appetite on my end to experience more of the menu.",

As we were sitting close enough to a service area, one young woman, a bus person, was rude to the other women on the wait staff.  I dine out to have an enjoyable meal without tension... this place was too fraught with drama to warrant a return.",

It was a random Tuesday and we just wanted something a little special. I ordered the skate wing and boyfriend ordered the pork trio. My fish wasn't bad, just too salty for me, but the sides with it did help balance and overall, it was enjoyable. Boy's pork dishes were all good, but the sides were a little odd tasting and disappointing.  But the food isn't what brought my star rating down it was the service. We were ignored in an almost empty dining room for probably 15 minutes (no drink orders, walked by by the servers). Once we did get to order, our questions were answered reluctantly. We definitely felt unwelcome and like we were bothering our server the entire time. We didn't order wine or dessert and got the impression we weren't spending enough money to de worth their time. Not thrilled and probably won't be back anytime soon.",

It was pricey.   As such, I'd expect the food to be pretty amazing. But it was a letdown in terms of value. At $$$, there food is worth 2 stars. If it were a $$, I'd probably give them 4 stars.   But I'm giving Spoon 3 stars because they have a sweet fireplace with couches around it. We sat there for about an hr after our meal just drinking cocktails--across from us was a man and woman in their 60s, doing the same thing. Classy.",

I had the Gorgonzola souffle appetizer, which was light and nicely balanced (I especially liked the pear and candied walnuts). However, the main course was rather disappointing. I had the seasonal salmon dish, which, while above average, was not commensurate with my expectations. The individual components of the dish (chorizo, corn) were good by themselves but just did not work well together.   That being said, I think Spoon is a step in the right culinary direction for Pittsburgh. Coming from Phoenix and NYC, I was rather surprised at the lack of options the city presents. While Spoon is hardly at the level of a Per Se, it certainly has the makings of a very good restaurant.",

I was very relieved by  his positive attitude, as I am used to some folks rolling their eyes when I mention gluten-free requirements. The food and service were excellent.

Everything is sourced as locally and sustainably as they can manage, which is always a good thing, in my book.  The food was great, but it did take a little bit for it to come out.  The servers were incredibly apologetic about the timing - I think it's just one of those things they have to work out.  We started with a tuna tartare appetizer, which was great.  We then shared the pork entree, which was also really delicious.  Portion sizes were just right, not too much, and not too small.  The vodka gimlet, btw, is definitely worth trying.  Very tasty!  The decor doesn't look substantially different from what it did when it was Red Room, but the food IS substantially better!  And isn't that what counts?  Although ... I do have one request - could they please bring back the croissant chocolate bread pudding they used to make at Red Room as a dessert?  Pretty please?",

If this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, then I can't wait to go back to New York. The bf (who recently moved here to start a fellowship) took me here for my birthday given all of its hype on Yelp. This has been one of those rare instances where Yelp has failed me.   Either the chef wasn't in the kitchen tonight or this place is just mediocre regardless. I have to admit that the bread basket was outstanding (best bread basket I've ever had), but that's as far as it goes. The sangria was fine. The island rum punch burned my throat and was left untouched thereafter. The pork belly was underwhelming (oh how I miss that pork belly at L'Ecole in Soho), but I did like the fried oyster. The shrimp and pappardelle was extremely salty, but since the portion was pretty small I was able to finish it. The halibut was perfectly cooked (although I wasn't asked how I preferred it) but it was under-seasoned as well. The best part of the halibut dish was the \"hash brown\". The shrimp accompanying it wasn't seasoned (or at least tasted like it was simply boiled). The bacon-wrapped veal (medium-rare) was also perfectly cooked, but the bacon fat made the veal taste like deli ham through and through. The sausage wasn't anything special either. Surprisingly (or maybe not surprisingly come to think of it), we did not finish our entrees. The components of the entrees just didn't go well together for me. The raved-about \"bacon and eggs\" and miso glazed cod weren't on the menu, but I figured all the entrees would be spectacular. We declined dessert, but the bf was expecting at least a complementary birthday candle or something of the sort. This was actually the first restaurant I've ever been to that did not offer anything for the birthday girl.  Like many of you, I've also eaten at the best restaurants in NY and SF, and I really cannot believe all the hype. I expected more given that Chef Brian worked at Gary Danko in SF (which I had gone to for my birthday as well and had an amazing experience). I wish Chef Brian lots of luck and hope for continued growth and better food.  (P.S. The online menu needs to be updated. I was looking forward to the Thai shellfish tasting, but that's no longer on the menu.)",

I had the \"wings\" appetizer.  Nicely prepared and presented - not just buffalo wings.  These had great flavor and were fresh.  My entree was the blacked chicken with linguine.  Again, this was very flavorful and the pasta was home-made.  French press coffee for desert.  Others at the table had the hanger steak, salads, soup. Everyone was very pleased.  The noise level was low which made for pleasant conversation.  Our service was very attentive.  I looked at other reviews which mentioned very poor service.  These were either \"opening\" problems or off nights.  Our server was very good.  The wine list was OK.  Because of Pennsylvania's stupid PLCB, I never order wine.  The prices and selections are not up to the food.  There were a few good selections but (again, because of PA) the prices are just not worth the bottles.  This is why I usually stick to BYO restaurants.  I suggest sticking to the mixed drinks - they are much better values.  Overall a very good addition to the dining choices in Pittsburgh.",

All I will remember, however, is the table of women next to me behaving like they were in a sports bar with a Steelers game on.  They were talking and laughing so loudly that it was more than annoying, it was unbelievable that a quality restaurant would allow their other guests to be treated so rudely.  Once I complained something was said to them and they quieted down (for a while) but by the time I got angry enough to complain the \"special night\" I had saved for Spoon was ruined.  Over $100 to be around truly annoying people - not a second chance for you, Spoon.",

He ordered the chicken two ways, and I had a salmon caesar salad.  The food was cooked perfectly and the presentation was artful.  Although the meal was great, I think my favorite thing about Spoon is the atmosphere--very modern, neutral color palette, lots of candles lit.  We will definitely return--it's a great place to sit and share a bottle of wine.",

We didn't know what to do with ourselves, so we dived right in with the 5 course tasting menu combined with wine pairings.  My God was it worth every penny.  We could not even finish the last course!  Everything was so delicious and elegantly plated.  Definately not your standard american fare. If you see something on the menu called \"Bacon and Eggs\" Don't question it. Just order it.  It was the most amazing thing ever.  They use fresh local and organics ingredients for their products.  The tasting menu was 65 a person and 30 to add on the wine.  It was superb.  I am looking for excuses to go back!  Also-- I do not agree with the \"Casual\" dress attire. I think this is a place where people should dress up a bit.",

This is why I'm giving Spoon that extra star for a full five because if you can deliver such polished, respectful, elegant service without a reservation and seated at a bar, you have really upped your game and deserve it!  We started with the leek flan which reminded me of a delicate, crustless quiche and my husband had the burger (we learned our lesson, if a burger is on the menu at a fancy place, freaking get it!) and I had the pork roast. Of course, these have way fancier names on the menu, but just roll with me here :) We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and experience and I know that you will too, but I have one final shout out for their \"Responsible Citizen\" drink. They create a unique, seasonal mocktail that is on their drink menu. And for sober folks, being able to get something nice to drink that's not just a soda is just really super awesome :)",

My date is a meat-eater and I am vegetarian and she thought of the most incredible dishes for me.  I started with a fried tofu with grilled pineapple, raisin chutney, parsley and topped with a quail egg. The tofu was perfectly cooked and the raisins and pineapple gave it a sweet taste. The next course was frisee, radishes, avacado, edible flowers in a kohlrabi puree. It was a cooler, more refreshing dish that was very light. The third was a manicotti with house-made pasta, a rich cream sauce, with asparagus and pea shoots. A warmer and thicker dish in contrast to the previous dish. The pasta was perfect, soft with a slight tougher chew. A little softer than al dente which was good for manicotti.  The fourth, which was my main entree, was a completely unbelievable polenta! Seasoned with just the right amount of salt, it was the perfect consistency. I have never had a better polenta in my life. Had snow peas, a fried egg, asparagus and eggplant. We finished off with a dessert from the pastry chef, had bananas, sorbet and cream puffs and chocolate souffle.   Overall, it was fantastic. I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "From S+P incorporated, Spoon has been gracing the Pittsburgh scene for almost 3 years now, situated on the corner of center and s highland in the latest up-and coming East Liberty location.  The space is roomy yet intimate, if that can be understood, with an atmosphere of sophistication and carefully crafted food. If it's a date or a pre-interview school event, Spoon makes all it's guests feel welcome and attended to. To drink I had a berry caipirinha, that delicious south american rum drink that just reminds me of summer. If you like berries, this drink is full of them so order up, however, if you are looking for a good portion of actual rum, you may want to go with another selection. The pomegranates and berries soak up the liquid so prepare to eat a bit of fruit. Later in the meal I switched to pleasant Cabernet Sauvignon.  Yesterday's meal was a little rocky so I will be pulling from all experiences i had. I started off with an appetizer of the pate en croute, cooked in a typical rectangular mold and served with grain mustard and cornichons and red pickled onions. I had gotten so used to liver pates that so me, this unspreadable version was a readjustment. Pickled red onions were a perfect offset, I almost wish there had been more than provided.   As I naturally can never make up my mind, I strayed from the traditional entrees to the small/large plates so I can have two. I ordered the spring risotto, made with local ramps, English peas, beans, asparagus, and drenched in parmesan; a creamy mixture in a half bowl. Now a couple things, personally I did not like the ramp and asparagus combination, the garlicky taste did not mesh well but that's just flavoring on my end. My second small plate was their Rabbit and Pork Sugo with fresh rigatoni and preserved rooftop tomatoes, a melt in your mouth combination that would have kept me going forever.  Now whether or not the dish was to your liking or not, I personally was peeved with the presentation of the small plates. While I enjoy the curved white bowl and allow the risotto or pasta to sink to the side, the small portion will leave a lot of blank space, that I feel should have been addressed.   The lovely part about spoon are their specialty brunch menus. Normally closed on Sundays, they will offer special occasion Sunday, such as Mother's Day or Easter. These brunch menus are excellent and perfect for a nice group of people or family. Make sure to reserve yourself a spot for these, you will not be disappointed.",

We were seated at a nice corner table (we were also offered the option of patio seating, which we declined).  Hostess and wait staff were all friendly and present, well dressed and groomed.  Our main server was particularly good--nice personality, knowledgeable, maybe a little too soft spoken, but hey, nobody's perfect! overall he made it a great restaurant experience.  We started with the pea flan and the chicken liver mousse.  The flan was warm and lovely, and tasted purely of the essence of peas.  The crisped prosciutto was a perfect accompaniment.  Ditto the crisply grilled baguette served with the airy, gorgeous liver mousse.  Nice start!  For main courses, we went for the gnocchi with pork and an Asian twist, and the hangar steak with potato puree, plus a side of roasted cauliflower to share.  Had just a taste of the gnocchi, which was nice, and the husband loved.  My steak was cooked to perfection, just delicious.  Cauliflower was also quite good.  Dessert was the flourless chocolate torte and the strawberry rhubarb tart, both of which were outrageously good.  The torte was decadently chocolate--so rich, portioned just right--awesome.  The tart was accompanied by strawberry balsamic macarons, which were delicate and so, so good.  It was a wonderful evening, a little on the pricey side for us, but great for our special occasion.  We will definitely be back, but not sure how soon.  Can't afford to eat out like that very often, but we didn't feel Spoon was overpriced.  Rather, it was worth every penny!",

It was a mon or tues evening and we made a reservation for 6:30ish. We were seated immediately which was nice.  Okay ambiance, A+. A+++ ambiance. Everything about the ambiance was great, the lighting was soft but bright enough that we can see the menus and each other real easily, unlike some other places. Cute little candle on the table, too.  The bread basket was one of the things I'd been looking forward to the most, we love good bread. Unfortunately I watched tables around us getting their bread baskets, after we had already ordered our drinks and all our food and were waiting for the apps.. so eventually I asked a busser walking by our table if we could please get a bread basket. My husband was like \"I can't believe you actually had to ask for it..\" so that was pretty meh. The bread was AMAZING so I mean it's just one of those things. Btw we both worked in restaurants for years, he was a cook while I was a server and busser, so we know how restaurants work and I do understand that when it's a busy time or if someone called off that day or something, I understand things aren't always the server's fault.   One thing I never like is when a restaurant refuses to allow any modifications to the menu. I doubt it's the server's fault, clearly the kitchen/managers are the ones who make those rules. We just wanted to switch one of the sides that came with a certain dish for a different side and it wasn't allowed. Whatever not the biggest deal ever but just is not what makes customers happy.  My husband started with the red pepper soup and I had the fall greens salad, and we were gonna share an empanada to start with. He said the soup was fine but he wished there was some type of garnish or mix-in that would give the soup some texture, he said it should be called a puree. This may be personal preference but idk, I don't eat red pepper. The fall greens salad was DELICIOUS. I love this type of salad and they did it well. But they did put beets in it, which is NOT in its description on the menu, so I had to pick them off. The salad was amazing and I ended up wishing I had gotten a second salad as my entree. Now the empanada, oh man. The whole thing was soggy like you had to eat it with fork and knife but the DOUGH ITSELF was soggy like they had poured some kind of juice all over it. Idk, it really didn't seem to match the description on the menu. Sooo disappointing. We literally ate one bite each and left it.   For our entrees, husband got the hanger steak, and I got the spoon burger. I liked that it was grass fed beef. The hanger steak was fine, although they refused to change the side of braised onions to anything else so he just asked for it without any onions. Like great idea, cooked onions as a side dish for a steak *eyeroll*. Oh and they didn't ask what temp he would like his steak cooked to! It came rare, he would have ordered medium-rare but we don't like sending food back so he just ate it. My burger came with fries. The soggiest, bottom of the bucket from the leftovers from lunch that day, soggy ass fries. I don't think they were actually from lunch, they were just some of the most mushy and like neglected fries that I've ever seen. This was REALLY disappointing cause I had been looking forward to them. Thank god we hadn't ordered an extra side of fries as I had originally wanted to. Fix your fries please!! The burger, I had ordered it medium-well and clarified \"still juicy like just a little pink but more juicy than well\" and it came out VERY VERY VERY well done. I literally only had a few bites cause it was so dry it was hard to eat. I understand I ordered medium-well but there is a difference between medium-well and well done. And yes I know grass fed beef has less fat in it, but if I am able to cook a grass fed burger myself at home and manage to make it juicy at medium-well, a nice restaurant should def be able to do the same.   Andd usually servers ask if we would like a dessert menu or not, we were ready to pay the bill and get out when she just placed dessert menus on the table without saying anything. Not a big deal but again the little things. Anyway we still tipped 25%, total for 2 people was $80 plus tip, not too bad but when 4/5ths of the food sucked that is a lot. I guess I'll give 3 stars instead of 2. Star for ambiance, by appearance you'd expect a 5 star experience. Star for service, it's never perfect anywhere and you can see the servers know the menu, the bussers are helpful and do a great job too, everyone's friendly, seated us right away with our reservation, etc.. and one more star for my salad being great and the fact that they use grass fed beef.   Minus two stars for the rest of the food, all that money wasted, having to ask for the bread basket, etc.. welp wish this had gone better than it did.",

Our waitress was very helpful when it came to all of our gin questions. The drinks were awesome and very unique, as was the food. We started with carrot pirogies which were more of a pot sticker but seriously high in flavor. I then had ravioli with roasted tomatoes and mushrooms with creamed corn. It was awesome. I can't say I will be back often, but it's good to finally cross Spoon off my \"go eat here\" list!",

    "text": "Went here for restaurant week with my fiance and we were very pleasantly surprised by the entire experience! Excellent food from start to finish, and the young girl that served us was extremely good! I wish I remember her name, but she provided excellent service without being fake or overbearing.   The bread basket was amazing! We had three kinds of bread - including a version of their cornbread with whipped butter. All served warm.  For starters, my fiance had the blue cheese souffle which was light and fluffy with a taste that wasn't overly cheesy, and I had the pork belly noodle. I don't know what those other reviews are talking about, but our portions were huge! The starters could have easily been mains at any other pretentious restaurant. My noodles had a very tasty broth and the pork belly was cooked to perfection. We also ordered a starter of the lamb meatballs with naan because all the other reviews made us think we would be starving if we stuck to the normal portions. The naan was very strange (I'm Indian so I know it's not what naan is supposed to be like) - it was mushy and seemed to be undercooked, but the meatballs were extremely tasty and well seasoned - they made us forget about the strange 'naan'  For mains, my fiance had the salmon and I had the steak. Both were very good!   The desserts kept up with the extremely good meal we had - the cheesecake bites and the chocolate mousse cake were both amazing!!! I can't say that they could be any better.  Our entire experience from start to finish was great - excellent service, presentation, and food. We are looking forward to going back and trying the many other things on their menu. Definitely recommend this place for a quality meal with with good service and ambience.",

    "text": "I loved my visit to Spoon.   The menu was full of interesting and seasonal dishes that you don't see much elsewhere.  I ate way too much, a sign of a great place for sure.     I started at the bar with a Watermelon Tonic.  Now this is not my usual type of drink, but I saw her making one for someone else and I was intrigued.   It was delightful - fresh and light and just a touch of sweetness.  I find fruit cocktails way too sweet most of the time, but this was just perfect.     I then went on to the table, where we started with an amazing basket of bread.  There were three types of break in there - a biscuit, a muffin, and a sliced loaf.  They were all good, but I really could have just had three of the cream cheese biscuits.  Or maybe just a basket of those...  My first course was the grilled avocado with charred tomato vinaigrette, oven roasted tomato, burrata.  I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't order it again.  $8 for half an avocado and a garnish of the other items - it just didn't do it for me.     Second course was the bleu cheese souffle with peaches, nectarines, plums, frisee, arugula, candied walnuts, stone fruit coulis,honey + white balsamic vinaigrette.   This was fantastic.  The souffle had great texture and flavor and was well paired with the little side salad.   Worth every penny of the $10.     My main course was a small portion of the \"strozzapreti all'amatriciana\" - stewed branzino, pickled peppers, pecorino, chili flake.  This was a pasta dish with bits of fish in it.  It was great overall - again, much attention was paid to flavor and texture.  I was stuffed by the time I got to it, but I ate every bite anyway.     The service was pretty good throughout, albeit very slow when it was time to wrap up and get out of there.   I do wish they'd given us a couple more of those little biscuits too.  Did I mention they were amazing.",

However, this visit was not up to par. I know I came into the restaurant 15 minutes before closing but that DOES NOT mean I should be treated any differently than another patron. The dining room had few patrons, and the hostess acted as if we were a huge imposition. After being seated, our server babbled off the specials so fast, I had to ask for a second go through. As soon as he figured out we weren't ordering alcoholic drinks, it was as if our fate was sealed.   The bread that everyone raves about was great. Except for the fact that I wasn't given any butter. I can't tell you how many times I had to ask the server for more water. I felt like I was being punished for being at Spoon.   I ordered the Octopus and truffle because I wasn't hungry enough for a full entree.   Next time, I will ask for a table that is out of view from the hostess stand because two of the servers and the hostess, stared at me while I ate.   I'm sorry that this visit, I did not spend over $500, as I did last visit. But I was a returning patron bringing back a new patron. Who has a very bad taste in his mouth about Spoon, not regarding his Rabbit, but about the way he was treated.   2 measly stars.",

It wasn't crowded at all, but the tables on the far side of the restaurant were a little too close together for my liking. You could hear the conversation of the people next you very easily. The floor could also use some work, as the tiles were somewhat cracked.   The food was great! The restaurant had a NYE menu with a nice selection of appetizers and entrees to choose from. I chose the lobster with caviar for the appetizer, and the chicken breast for my entree. Both were very good and flavorful. My boyfriend had the chicken wing appetizer, rib eye, and the spoon bar. For dessert I had the spoon bar as well which was also very delicious. The NYE dinner set was $60 per person, and there was a wine pairing option for an additional $35. We didn't do the wine pairing, but the three coarse dinner was worth the price.    The service was very good as well. We'll be back!",

    "text": "If you've visited our blog, you may have noticed that we've been to over 130 restaurants in and around Pittsburgh.  Some have been great, others not so much.  We've enjoyed service, have been yelled at by owners, (only once at Dell's) and have experienced a myriad of different cuisines.  In the past two years it's been a fun journey exploring the Pittsburgh culinary scene.    After spending time in all of these different eating establishments, I've come across several restaurants that I like to frequent.  One such eatery is Spoon in East Liberty.  Of course Spoon has great service, a nice atmosphere and an extensive wine list, but most importantly, the food is great.  Chef Brian Pekarcik frequently proclaims to have a love-affair with \"all things pork,\" he also is quite capable at preparing duck (and other fowl), fresh seafood, and beef, seasonal veggies, desserts, etc.  Chef Brian's food can be described as unpretentious and uncomplicated.  You won't see molecular gastronomy at Spoon; you will however, experience perfectly prepared food that is delicious and satisfying.       Our evening started with Spring Pea Soup.  Two bowls of bright green deliciousness arrived at our table.  In addition to the velvety-smooth fresh puree of peas and lemon creme fraiche, there was feta cheese, lobster, and bacon lardons; micro greens completed the dish.  The freshness of the soup was intoxicating.  Huge chunks of sweet, tender lobster added texture, while the feta cheese and micro-greens cut sweetness.  The soup wasn't overly-seasoned; the peas were truly the star of the soup.  Although licking the bowl would have been frowned upon, we seriously considered it.  Our next courses were a Caesar salad with blonde anchovies and homemade croutons, and one of the Chef's signature dishes, a gorgonzola souffle with baby artichokes and baby asparagus.  A small salad with sweet vinaigrette accompanied the savory baked treat.  The souffle had a strong, but not overwhelming flavor.  Alternating bites of the blue cheese and salad with honey dressing made for a delectable flavor exchange.  Korean style pork belly was next.  A large slab of what looked like thick-cut bacon arrived with dashi, kimshi and a deep-fried oyster with a spicy aioli.  The pork was flavorful and tender.  The fried oyster was perfectly fresh with an orange dollop of emulsified heat.   The soba noodles with sous-vide duck breast were equally delicious.  We had fun using our chopsticks to lap up the tangy noodles and seared sea scallop.  Our oversized porcelain spoons were used to drink the broth and orange-chili vinaigrette.   The over-easy quail egg that sat atop the noodles added yet another flavor to this already great dish. Entrees:   Wild Pacific halibut with crab cake stuffed shrimp, potato rosti, sauteed asparagus, jalapeno hollandaise; pineapple + fava bean + Andouille sausage relish was next.  My dinner mate chose the duck (medium-rare) prepared with duck fat fried almonds, and a port wine reduction.  My fish was cooked properly (medium) and sweet.  The potato rostis were crispy and fun to eat (like a tater-tots) and the large shrimp, crab, and buttery hollandaise made for a  seafood fiesta.  The duck was tender and juicy- the almonds were rich and intense.  Port wine sauce cut the richness of the fowl just a tad.  After eight courses of food, we were ready to call it a night, but Chef Brian insisted that we have some dessert, \"Just a little something to complete the meal...\" he said.  OK, if you insist.  The plate of homemade raspberry sorbet with gluten-free almond cake looked amazing.  Macerated summer berries, white chocolate mousse, and a thick ribbon of a homemade fruit roll-up completed the dessert.    We left Spoon satiated, but not too full.  As we drove home we continued to go over the evening's fare.  Everything we sampled (without exception) was perfection.  So I'm going to say it- Spoon is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  If you haven't made it yet, hopefully this review will point you in the right direction.",

And that bread basket... #feedme #carbs #bringmemore #noreallytheywillbringyoumoreifyouask   Ambiance-wise, Spoon has a cool vibe, but there is also a small walled-in garden seating area that I would highly recommend if the weather's nice. Food-wise, I'll just leave this here: Of the hundreds of restaurant stalls at Pittsburgh's Best Restaurants event, Spoon's lamb-infused pasta dish was my #1.",

    "text": "I can't believe we waited so long! Really! It is a as close to 5 star as you can get. I will explain further. We were seated promptly by a very nice hostess in a cool, trendy little restaurant.  The vibe is cool and chic. We were immediately tended to by our wonderful waitress. She was attentive and super nice. She immediately brought us water and the superb wondrous bread basket. Oh the delight in the basket of' bread. Ours included the corn muffins that were little but oh the flavor. If you read any of the other reviews then you will have noticed the mention of the muffin with chives and the wonderful cream cheese delight in the middle, wow! And we also had a baguette with the amazing honey butter with sea salt. We decided on the chicken meatball appetizer. The meatball was smaller but you get three and on the side - a grilled sourdough with what I can best describe as a hummus type topping. I loved the grilled sourdough however the hubby did not and this is where the 4 star comes into play( from the hubby). I chose the seared fluke as my entree. It is a seared fish with a lobster and artichoke saute. The fish atop an amazing , tasty English pea and goat cheese ravioli. I have to say the ravioli made this dish. It made a ho hum piece of fish phenomenal! The hubby chose the duo of beef which is grilled rib eye and braised cheek on loaded smashed potatoes with baby veggies, natural reduction and  bacon and arugula salad. The rib eye was so tender and juicy. The hubby did not like the cheek noting it tasted too much like a roast than a steak. He was not keen on the cheek. I got a side of roasted fingerling potatoes which were done to perfection. The hubby chose a side of roasted baby veggies- yum! And for dessert...I chose the s'mores. I love bacon but candied bacon is on a whole other level. The bacon coupled with the dark chocolate terrine (it was like a little dark chocolate cake) and the little puffs of marshmallow goodness and the cumin Graham cracker and the rice crispie treat, amazing! The hubby chose the Spoon bar which was what can best be described as one terrific chocolate piece of cake ( some of the best I have ever had). If you are looking for a wonderful place that is a little pricier I would recommend Spoon. We will go back again! It was a terrific dinner from start to finish!",

    "text": "A disappointing dining experience at Spoon last week. A long time favorite has slowly been loosing its edge. While the menu items still offer a declining number of inspired treats it's service standards have been in a free fall. The most recent example would never have happened a few years ago at Spoon. Perhaps the restaurant boom in Pittsburgh is making it more challenging to find top quality servers. Ours last week varied from indifferent to useless to sarcastic. Questions about the menu were answered with indifference at best and disdain at worst. The nadir was reached when he was clearing our entree plates. One of our guests had barely touched a risotto-like dish which wasn't to her liking. I had ordered the same item and found it to be acceptable but not worthy of a reorder at a subsequent visit. I pointed out to the server that our guest hadn't really enjoyed her selection and left it all but uneaten and he responded by saying ---and I kid you not --- \"well, you ate all of yours\". And that was that. So much for gaining customer insight for the chef.",

The scallops were wonderfully cooked but I didn't care for the amount of sauce on the plate. The red snapper entree was strange with romain and olives in a warm pearl rice filling the bottom of the dish. Other than that the dinner was decent. Neither of us liked our cocktails. Side note we were seated by the exit door.... THE ENTIRE PLACE WAS EMPTY. Also the exit door duals as a breezeway for an apartment building so you can hear people buzzing in to the building. I don't think we're going back.",

    "text": "Returned to Spoon last night after a 5-star experience last winter and was unfortunately a bit disappointed.   We sat outside which was very nice. Only a few tables, so it felt private and the weather was perfect. Waters were poured right away, but then no server returned to the table for at least 10 minutes. We had to ask one of the other servers outside if we could please place a drink order. He ran inside and found our server. Who casually greeted us with \"thank you for your patience.\" An apology would have been more appropriate.   Our party of three planned to try the Chef's family style meal, because my husband and I enjoyed it so much last visit. We decided against it this time, after hearing the offering. Each of us started with the Spring Salad. The plating was nothing short of bizarre. The salad was positioned around the rim of the round plate like a crescent moon, leaving the center completely empty. It looked like half of the salad had slid from the plate on the trip from the kitchen--sadly, it was intentional. Apart from the plating, the salad was VERY skimpy and inconsistent for $10. My husband had no wax beans  and all three lacked seasoning. Double the portion and plate more sensibly! We also tried the carrot pierogi to start. The pork filling was delicious...no complaints here!  The three of us had varied experiences with the entree course. My husband mostly enjoyed his choice, the burger. Thought it was nicely cooked but said the bun-to-meat ratio was off--too much bread--and the pineapple was take or leave. He really enjoyed the frittes, though! I had the pork belly loin chop, which was the hit of the table. The \"rice polenta\" schmear underneath was fantastic and the lentils and pork were perfectly cooked. My only complaint was the aggressive ginger note in the \"barbecue sauce.\" My friend's choice, however, was the low point of the entree course. He had the bay scallops with Israeli couscous. It looked like something I would make at home on a busy work night and/or would serve as a SIDE DISH. The flavors were good--I liked the red pepper--but the dish was screaming for another protein like some prawns or sea scallops instead of bay. Just about as bizarre as the salad for me.   Dessert was good! My friend and I each had the flourless chocolate torte. The mocha bark garnish was AMAZING. I could eat a whole plate! I could go without the thick white chocolate ganache piped on top of the torte (I scraped it off), but overall my chocolate craving was satisfied! My husband had the ice creams: vanilla, graham cracker, and mint chip. All good. The vanilla was too icey, but the fresh mint made up!   I raved about my previous experience at Spoon and was deflated by the fact that it was just \"so-so\" this time. I plan to try again in the colder months when some of the heartier dishes make their return!",

    "text": "Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five. Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5. Decor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass. I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid. Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament. The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back. Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entree, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauteed spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was. Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew. We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.",

    "text": "I have to say, one of my favorite things to do in Pittsburgh is belly up to the bar at Spoon and settle in for the night. The wine list is great, I like the feeling of the restaurant from the vantage point of the bar, and I really enjoy the service. Ok and the biscuits.  In total honestly, Spoon has been a bit hit or miss for me in terms of the food - it can depend on who is in the kitchen. Sometimes the kitchen is more adventurous than others, and sometimes dishes just gel better than others. But regardless of what I order I always feel like I had a great time in the warm, inviting dining room. The wine list is always delicious, with great choices by the glass or bottle.  The last time I was at Spoon the experience was just fantastic. It was a last minute game-time decision, and I think I had my best meal there. There was a home-made pasta with truffle, olive oil, and basil that I think about every day. So simple. So much truffle.  The amberjack was absolutely delicious, an excellent sashimi snack. The green salad was very well dressed and also made up of straightforward, simple ingredients. The lettuce was really lovely. Oh and the Lo Mein. Lo Mein, you ask? I know. It's ridiculous. We're in Pittsburgh and this is not a Lo Mein joint, but it was so tasty and comforting.   Our bartender was just adorable and he made excellent recommendations, he talked me into a white even though i was dead-set on a gamay. It was just so good. Also they have a nice variety of amaros, which can be as good as dessert. Not surprisingly, their desserts are also so good. There's this frozen Mars Bar ice-cream type thing that make it worth it to take copious Lactaids in order to digest.   All in all, I think it's not just the wine, it's not just the food, it's really the package deal that I enjoy so much and that keeps me coming back.",

My first impression walking in was good. The ambiance is perfect and the decorations were a nice touch.  The hostess seated us and it took a little bit to finally get waited on but our waitress was very nice and attentive after the fact.  I got the grilled avocado as an appetizer, a must try if you are an avocado fan.  For the main course, I got the seared tuna and scallops. It was good but not amazing, almost a little bit too soupy and it took away from the flavor of the tuna and scallops inside the bowl.  My fiance got the grilled hanger steak. Again, nothing to rave about but good. Portions are not very big, unless you order an appetizer, entree and dessert you will leave still feeling hungry.  Overall, I think it's an overpriced restaurant and there are better choices for elegant dining in Pittsburgh. I do not recommend.",

    "text": "I'm a little torn with this place. I came here twice and had 2 different entrees.   The first time I came here I got the alaskan halibut ravioli and it was delicious. The service was excellent as well.   The second time I came here I got the duo of beef. The duo of beef has about 3 quarter sized squares each of ribeye steak and short rib. I asked for medium but the steak came out well-done but I thought the steak was very tender. The steak was definitely the highlight of the plate. The short rib was extremely heavy. It had a lot of fat on it so it was a bit chewy and it was really salty. The creamed corn on the plate was also really salty for some reason. Overall I was really disappointed with the duo of beef.  For dessert I had the 'banana.' The banana had bruleed bananas, chocolate mousse, banana bread, and goats milk yogurt. The bruleed bananas were divine, the banana bread was also very good paired with the chocolate mousse. Lastly, goats milk has a very particular taste. If you like goat cheese then you'll probably like the goat yogurt.  I shared this dessert with my boyfriend and Spoon tastefully split the dessert into two plates for us (even though we didn't ask for it to be)!   After my second time here, I'm a little torn. I loved the alaskan halibut ravioli the first time I came here and didn't like the duo of beef so much the second time around. However, the banana dessert was divine. I would say overall I would give place 3.5 rounded to 4 stars after these 2 visits. The service and ambiance are pretty great too.",

This restaurant has been on my list of places to try in Pittsburgh for a LONG time - and I finally got here!   I went during the polar vortex (when it was about -7 degrees without the windchill), and they had $3.00 valet parking for Spoon and BRGR. Perfect.   The waiters and waitresses were friendly and attentive - and they knew what they were talking about. There were so many delicious choices - but the staff had a way with words that helped me decide.   I went for the Alaskan Black Cod and Crab Cakes with root veggies, potato risotto, brussels sprout leaves and beets - #yum. Oh! And the bread that they served from BreadWorks...melt in your mouth good. Their menu changes often as they support Western PA farmers by using fresh and local ingredients - always a big fan of establishments that abide by the 'Farm to Table' movement.   The atmosphere was romantic - dark, quiet and calming. I didn't like that they sat us near the windows (a bit too much cold for the heavy curtains to keep out) - there weren't many other people dining due to the weather - so I would have thought that they would placed us a little more central in the restaurant, away from the cold windows...   They had a high top table for about 8 (maybe more) near a fireplace close to the bar - not sure if they consider that to be a separate bar area different than the restaurant - but I thought how fun it would be for a group dinner - great cocktails and delicious food.   I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to check out Spoon for awhile now after having read all the good reviews on Yelp. The restaurant week menu seemed like a pretty good deal to me, so I went for it, while my husband thought he'd like to pick off the menu instead.   First Course: 1. [restaurant week] roasted pork belly: I thought it was kind of strange to start off dinner with a big bowl of noodles. It was really filling, so I don't quite understand why they chose to put this on the menu. While the pork belly delicious, the whole thing tasted like a home made meal I would otherwise be able to make at home. And honestly it doesn't really go with the theme of the restaurant.  2. wild boar pappardelle: cooked al dente and tasted only okay   Second Course: 1. [restaurant week] grilled hanger steak-  this probably justified my ordering from the restaurant week menu. Not sure if I tasted the foie gras in the reduction, but otherwise the steak was cooked very well and I enjoyed it. 2. spoon burger - good burger, but overcooked, he asked for medium, and it looked pretty well done. the fries were not great, kinda like the ones served at Park Bruges/Pointe Brugge Cafe  Desserts: 1. [restaurant week] spoon bar: this is the restaurant's specialty dessert, the classic. it was very rich. The mousse tasted more like a chocolate ice cream, not very light and fluffy but dense. The appearance of it looked great, but my husband who ended up eating the spoon bar only thought it was okay and not very memorable.  2. pecan - the pie was really hard to cut, and I was provided a spoon and a fork to eat this, and was struggling to cut it up. The candied bacon was in long strips and would have been better if it was chopped up so you can taste the bacon with the pie. It was just really awkward eating this dessert, the sweet tea sorbet was a nice touch though.   Service was great though. the other thing that bothered me was that the corking fee for a bottle of wine was $20!?!?!?!?! and if it was a bottle the restaurant served, they would charge you for the price of the bottle??? This is just ridiculous. Let's not be pretentious here, we're not in New York City and the food is only mediocre at best. Overall this was a pretty disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Spoon is back!   I quit going to Spoon at least a year ago. The space had gotten really tired, and the menu no longer had the feeling of excitement that it had when it first opened.  So I was interested but not optimistic about returning after learning that they had redecorated and hired a new executive chef.   We came in on Sunday and discovered a new restaurant.  The layout is pretty much the same, but the tables are new, the lighting is new, everything feels fresh.  The menu is totally different--yay--and everything was so interesting we decided to just start out with small plates.    We had a smoked blue fish plate, an outstanding crepe stuffed with cauliflower tikki masala, a seafood cazuala, and korean fried chicken.  All fantastic.  My favorite, though, was the side of turnips with a maple sauce and peppers.  So awesome.  We tried two desserts and both were off the charts good.   I've been back 3 times.  Add the fish entre and steak for visits 2 & 3.  Both great.  Definitely an ATF in Pittsburgh.  One minor request--dim the lights just a little!  Too bright!  ------",

I was initially a little disappointed because we had chosen the restaurant based on the menu we had seen online, which was not up to date. My husband and I ordered cocktails, the Riviera Side and Check My Spelling. I wasn't impressed with the Riviera Side, I thought it just tasted like hard lemonade, but my husband loved his cocktail.   We each ordered a different entree, chicken, scallops, octopus and lamb shank. Everyone loved their meals, I especially loved the octopus! Our friend who ordered the scallops was disappointed in the quantity, though admittedly that's normal with scallop entrees. The chicken entree was huge, tons of food! Our server was excellent, he came around often enough to check in, but didn't hover. Overall, it was a really enjoyable dinner!",

There's no competition in my opinion, Spoon is ,respectfully, in a league of its own. There is street parking--if you can find a space,  garage parking or valet ($3).   When I walked into this place, I melted into the room. It was so beautiful with the lounge area at the entrance near the bar. Speaking of which makes some killer cocktails.  Just a tip....order something with gin, anything.  They know gin and honor it well here.   Food...the empanadas, yummy...try them. My main course was the pork belly chop that that was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Truly a great dining experience that I hope to repeat...soon.",

I've never been asked before \"What kind of water would you like?\" I didn't even realize there was more than one kind lol.   Anyway, if you love to eat (like I do) you should absolutely do the tasting menu. WARNING: you will be stuffed! But it is all so delicious, so why not!? Every single thing I've tried has been good. This restaurant doesn't have a cook, it has a chef. Make sure you shove down some dessert too, it's the best!  The service is top notch. Once you're finished with one dish, your next one is brought right out to you. Your drink never goes dry either. Going to the Spoon is one of the best places you can take your lady-women are always talked to and served first. It's just so old school (in a good way, like when women were respected and men were polite) and a high class experience (feels like you're rich enough to afford your own servants). I know that might sound silly, but to me, it's awesome!",

    "text": "I don't know why this place only has 4 stars because I'd give it 10 if I could. Spoon is officially my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Everything from the decor to the service is on point - the food is obviously RIDICULOUS.  Honestly, I'd come back here for the bread basket alone.  My family and I started with three apps:  the small cheese tray ($12), the tomato soup ($9), and the frites ($5).  We shared everything because we're all about trying new things!  Our cheese tray came with housemade walnut bread.  If you get the large platter, you can try all 6 cheese for $18 - the small tray comes with 3.    The frites (aka house-cut french fries) were SO good. They came out pipin' hot and were seasoned to perfection.  They were accompanied by two sauces: roasted garlic aioli and Spoon hot sauce - both were legit, but I preferred the latter.  My favorite starter though was definitely the tomato soup.  It was SO creamy and flavorful.  Bonus points for the mini oyster po' boy - such a cute and yummy touch!  Moving on to entrees, my dad and I both ordered the smoked pork shank, while my mom got the chicken.  Both dishes were spot-on.  The pork came with white cheddar polenta and stewed summer squash.  The meat was so tender, it melted in my mouth.  Hands down, the best pork dish I've had in years! My mom's chicken came with cous cous, quinoa, roasted red peppers, and artichokes.  I had a bite, and it was scrumptious.  They really know how to cook their meat!  At this point, we were all stuffed, but once we heard desserts were made in-house, we couldn't resist, ha!  It was a hard call - everything looked so good - but we ended up getting the black forest - hazelnut flourless cake with house-made Luxardo cherries, chantilly cream, and white chocolate crumb.   The cake was rich but not too sweet.  It was the perfect end to a phenomenal meal.    Everything was executed and presented flawlessly.  For a truly incredible meal, hit Spoon up STAT.",

A unique aspect of the pasta was the portion size - it was not a small plate, as one reviewer claimed, but a proper, European portion, that allows for a constant BMI throughout a lifetime, rather than an American serving that results in a parabolic BMI graph versus time. In addition to the positive BMI effect, the eatable portion main leaves room for desert, which we typically can't handle. We shared the monkey bread, which contained no bread or monkey, and would be better named 'apple cobbler explosion'. It was just Ok. Service and wine list were very good, and the bread, as everyone notes, is extraordinarily good. The room, being full, was a little crowded and pretty loud. Overall a very good experience which could only be improved by returning on a slow weekday.",

I was able to try the fall salad with candied pistachios and beets and the bay oysters main dish. Both dishes were so perfect. The bay oysters was my favorite and were served with couscous, chorizo, and chanterelles. This was the best warm and filling meal for the season.

I got the blue cheese souffle which was really tasty.  The little salad that comes with it has a great acid to balance out the rich souffle.  I had a hard time picking a main, but went with the waitress suggestion of the veggie entree.  It was really tasty.  The eggplant was really crisp and the pasta was great!  I would say the fresh muffins and biscuits they bring out is prob the best \"bread\" I have had at a restaurant in a while.  Some kind of cream cheese chive biscuit, holy cow, yum!!!

Went here on a date with my husband and we both agree it's not a great date spot unless you don't like to talk to your significant other. It was far too loud for any sort of conversation and the tables were so close together you could hear what everyone around you was discussing.   On the flip side, the food was very nice. We had the Caesar Salad, Salmon Hot & Cold (scrumptious), Duck Two Ways, Filet & Short Ribs, and the apple and baklava desserts. Everything came out gorgeously plated, though we found the portions to be a little small.   The salmon app was cooked to perfection, as was my duck breast. The husband insists his short ribs could have been cooked more, but I had some and they were pretty tasty.   One random side-note: there was a medley of delicious but unidentifiable roasted root veggies on my plate and one of them (the orange-ish one) I hated violently. It tasted like sour dirt. I am confident it's a personal preference, but I'd love to know what it was so I can avoid it in the future. I don't think it was the turnips.  Back to the food: dessert was also very tasty, if a bit small-portioned. And, as an added bonus, Spoon has a great specialty cocktail list. I had the Vancouver in a Glass, which was wonderfully scotch-y and weirdly effervescent. In my opinion, an imaginative specialty cocktail menu gives a restaurant serious bonus points.   It's also worth noting that they had a very extensive wine menu.  The service was not bad, not awesome either though. I'm still not sure who my server was, which made it that much harder to tip. At least three people came to the table more than once, and we were a little over-waited on.  Overall, I'll be back, but preferably with a group",

The bread they brought out was amazing (3 different kinds).  I got the souffle as an appetizer. The ahi tuna as an entree and the spoon bar as a desert. It was all amazing. I would definitely recommend the ahi tuna to anyone (got it sushi rare).",

    "text": "They say beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If you eat meat and nothing else, and you haven't eaten much outside Pittsburgh, this is a four star. If you value vegetables, inventiviness and passion, a straight two.  If you or anyone in your party is vegan, vegetarian, or just doesn't want a hunk of meat, give Spoon a big miss. I've always got at least one of those in my party, and so I guess Spoon aint for me.  I very much enjoyed my meal. The braised beef was fantastic, fall-apart-at-the-touch-of-a-fork tender. But my fiancee found her non-meat plate so disappointing it ruined the evening for her.  And that's my first issue: the standards are wonderful... but they're fairly standard. Nothing surprising or inventive that we could find. How disappointing for a lauded place.  Perhaps more disappointing, this did not feel like Pittsburgh. Yes, I know towns change, and yes I know a lot of upper-income Pittsburghers would rather their town was more like (NW) DC. But the marble counters, standard menu options, and \"professional\" (indifferent) service could be a nice place in any third-tier city. I bet Scottsdale has a hundred places like this.  Where's the passion for the food, the local flavor?  The place was packed with the grey-haired set, milking their tables. You'll need a reservation, but you'll still be standing around for the better part of an hour while your table pretends it is still finishing that empty glass of wine, and management seems surprised by this development even though it seems to happen regularly.  In the end, I guess Pittsburgh needed a place that serves fantastic meat-and-potatoes in modern decor. But in Seattle I've eaten in beautiful rowhouses at the tables of inventive husband and wife teams who stood in front of me and put their hearts on the line. I expect as much from Pittsburgh.  The bar summed up the place for me: the bartender told me he likes bourbon, but all they had was brand-name, big-batch stuff.",

    "text": "First thing first....this place is expensive, so a special occasion only place for me & mine!!! All the reviews are dead on...the food, the flavors send you into a sensory overload!!! Fabulous!  We went at 5 on Valentine's Night. We had tried the night before to get reservations for the 14th online, but they were full. We thought we would give another try in person. They barely squeezed us in, but we were in nonetheless!! The service was impeccable and the waiter answered every question we had about our meal and meal ingredients with patience!  Now the good stuff the meal~ The bread basket: homemade buttermilk biscuits with chives that were amazing & I am a Southern girl, so I know my biscuits! And then 2 other of something else, that were good, but not that biscuit!  I had: gorgonzola blue cheese souffle: $9 roasted pickled beets, citrus + fennel +baby arugula salad, blue cheese, honey + white balsamic vinaigrette  This was insane the gorgonzola cheese paired with the pickled beets almost made me lose my mind...FANTASTIC!  miso glazed alaskan black cod: $28 prawn + pork potstickers, hot + sour mushroom broth, sesame broccolini, braised diakon, orange + chili glaze, sweet soy reduction, micro-cilantro  This was the first time I had cod, but for me anything with cilantro is a winner. The flavors in this entree were amazing with every bite I was moaning....again PERFECTION!  My Beau had: \"shrimp and grits\": $14 white cheddar + jalapeno polenta forest mushrooms, crispy bacon  Okay...this was great and brought with the new Sous Chef Kelsey from North Carolina. If I had not been raised on grits, I would not even have a complaint here, but since I was raised on grits this is my perception of this dish. The flavor of the grits were creamy and wall-balanced, but the texture was not what I am used to the grit its self was too coarse. I prefer my grits as creamy as cream of wheat. The shrimp was fantastic!  Kennedy's Farm chicken two ways: $19 seared breast, stuffed leg + thigh, ricotta cheese gnocchi, oven roasted tomato, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pickled pearl onions, local feta cheese  My Beau loved his meal. The stuffed chicken was like nothing he had ever tasted. We asked about the mixture: bread crumbs & black Forrest mushrooms. The chicken was perfectly cooked!  We each had a vodka drink. The total bill $95.00. Wonderful dinner for Valentine's evening!!!",

(seems legit, I know.)  Anyway, last night after a day of shopping (exhausting, but c'est la vie) we stopped over on highland to look up Cure's number as we couldn't remember if it was open Sundays. It is not. \"How about Spoon?\" excellent decision.  Ambiance does not usually make it or break if for me. I'll go for Calla Lily or Eleven; Milanos or Dinette. Spoon's atmosphere was lovely, though, and deserves recognition. Dark, but not cheesecake factory dark (honestly, turn some lights on), with enough space for comfort and privacy. A decent lounging area that I'm guessing gets packed Friday and Saturdays.  We started with some cocktails that came around the time the breads came out. The muffins and chives/cream cheese scones were warm and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We immediately asked for more scones to replenish our depleted stomachs while we sipped on some very tasty drinks, the sliberty smash (fruity) and vancouver in a glass (sweet). Both had little to no bite, yet still packed a punch.   The chicken two ways was fantastic. Barley risotto cooked perfectly with tasty pepper accent and artichokes.   AND THEN THE DESSERT. We got the spoon bar and the almond cake. The chocolate had excellent texture and beautiful aroma, and the almond cake was moist and light. I can't remember the last time I had a berry dessert that good. We'll be back.",

    "text": "An old friend and I had dinner at Spoon last night, a rainy Wednesday night.  I had made a reservation, just in case, but there were only 2 other couples in there so it probably was not necessary.  The hostess was super friendly and even made a little small talk with us while she seated us. The waitress came over right away, also very friendly. Water right away, but had to wait a tad longer than I was used to for the wine.  The glasses sat there, alone and empty. Also, the same glasses were used for white and red wines- not a huge deal but odd for un upscale eatery. AND...my pino grigio had a SCREW OFF cap, and cost $10. Ok, I understand that there was a cork shortage a while back, but, um, really?  The bread is definately something special. Two bite sized cornbreads with jalapeno and cream cheese filled puffs (yes, YUM!). Quite honestly though, I could have done without them as something to eat BEFORE dinner. They were way too heavy and seemed like something more suitable at breakfast. Just the cornbread nubs would have been enough-- those were light, delish, and just the right size!  I ordered the Crab Enchiladas and Green Salad. The salad was great- fresh greens, crunchy mango, peas, cucumbers and just the right amount of champagne vinagrette. The enchiladas....well the portion size was nice, and I enjoyed the spiciness.  However it was way too bland and creamy and I could barely taste the crab. The cilantro was barely noticable as well.  I realize that Spoon is not a mexican place, but the effort in making this dish authentic in any way seems lacking.  My friend ordered th Kobe Beef burger and fries. The buger was what you would expect of Kobe beef- soft, juicy, and literally melts in your mouth. I am not a huge beef eater, ever, but it really looked amazing when it came out and I had to try a bite. Again, something lacking though- perhaps a spice in the meat or salt....or something?  The fries were good though- served upright in a metal canister, sprinkled with herbs, light and crisp. I could have polished off a whole plate of those by myself.  Lastly, the Earl Grey and Citrus sorbet, which we split. The texture was too grainy and icy and it seemed like it was frozen and re-thawed a few times. OK flavor, but I couldn't really taste the tea.  I often judge my dining experience pretty heavily on ambiance, and I will say that Spoon does really well in that department.  It is warm and cozy inside with interesting art and metalwork. Again, the waitstaff was really great and made us feel welcome. BUT, the food just didn't do it for me.  I would return, but  perhaps for a cocktail only next time, as the bar is really hip and cool. But I would give some of the other new places in the neighborhood a chance first. One thing that I did enjoy though are the portion sizes.  Coming from CA, I often feel that portions are way bigger than they need to be here and I often overeat more that I would normally because it's there and I hate wasting food. Spoon definately knows what a normal, healthy portion looks like.   I am happy that Spoon is here becaue if fits really well in the new Penn Circle area of town. They just need to work on their recipes.",

    "text": "The food is tasty, but I had a few issues.  The apps were a duo of sashimi and bacon and eggs (pork bell, 5 minute egg).  Both dishes were fantastic - and nice portion sizes, so we were off to a great start.  But then...the cod had a bone in it. *Gasp* Some people might think it's being snobby -- but for the price ($28), the chefs know better, and it's an elementary mistake.  It's not TGIFs or Cheescake Factory, but a place with $20-30 entrees in a city where Primanti's is king.  Worse yet, my surf and turf (crabcake and NY strip steak) was cold.  Cooked to medium rare, but it was cold when it came out.  It clearly was sitting at the pass too long.  For the first time in my life, I sent a dish back (dude, $32 you better get it right!) - and it wasn't a newly fired entree -- but the same one just heated up more!  And so the meat was no longer medium rare -- and it was still only lukewarm.  Disappointing.  So basically, we had two dishes we wanted to send back -- we didn't send the cod because I had already sent the surf/turf back -and didn't want to be that table.  Oh well.  So we skipped desert.  A shame, because the food was otherwise good, we had excellent service, and a nice atmosphere.  We might consider coming back, but will probably try other places first.",

Our waitress didn't really smile while she serviced us which made her demeanor cold, the woman who gave us bread and filled our waters I liked. I asked our waitress for recommendations and decided to go with the Hailbut. The Halibut was meh, being overcooked/dry chewy and the dish was bland. Luckily I had filled myself with the variety of bread they offered, particularly the cream cheese. I also tried my husband's rabbit pasta and it was delicious - great flavor. My parents in law enjoyed the hanger steak and salmon. This is one of the more pricier meals so not particularly swayed to come back.",

    "text": "Came here for a date with fiance.  I totally agree with Amy C. and Mel U.  the tasting menu is the way to go.   What we had:  The bread basket (definitely needs to be remarked on.  This was so good.  The cream cheese chive biscuit was insane, and the butter was sweetened and tasted great on the other selections!) Offally Delicious (the calves tongue was delicious and tendered while the grilled bread did a great job of getting the terrine and rilletes into my mouth!) Gorgonzola Blue Cheese Souffle (I was worried that the blue cheese was going to overpower the other components, but it was wonderfully light and airy and the apples and pears beautifully complemented it.) Day Boat Scallops and Crabcake (I loved the scallop.  It was perfectly cooked and tasted sweet!  The crabcake was also delicious even though I have never been a huge fan and I thought that the aioli was a great addition) Grilled Filet and Braised Short Rib (This was the only dish that fell a bit short for me.  I thought that the filet was exquisite and perfectly cooked, but the short rib was a little too sickly sweet for my taste. The accompaniments were delicious specifically the duck fat potatoes and the baby vegetables.) Chocolate Dessert (the cake was delicious, but the amaretto chocolate milk shooter stole the show.  This thing was delicious and I am glad that it only came as a shooter because I would have tried to consume more had I had the chance and I was already full to the brim.)  Overall the food was delicious, though I found the service a bit lacking.  Things took longer than they should have in terms of the water service as well as getting bread or any help with the menu until about 15 minutes into sitting down.   Things were a little slack throughout the meal as well with lacking plate descriptions and the water (this is even with the personal carafes of water on the table) and bread service (multiple requests for bread had to be made) continuing to have problems.   Without the service issues this place would definitely be a 5 star establishment.",

The server said that the menu changes frequently, so I don't know if these items are going to be on the menu again, but the kabocha squash soup was delicious and beautifully presented! The wild boar sausage appetizer was not as well received. There was something \"off\" about the taste of it. The best entree ordered was the dry aged strip and short ribs. I ordered the crispy skin salmon,. which was very good if not particularly memorable.  The wines by the glass were delicious.  The desserts were really a highlight of the meal. Each dessert features a particular ingredient, and we tried all four of them: chocolate, apple, pear and butternut squash. The spoon bar was especially decadent. Definitely recommend saving room for dessert!",

My boyfriend and I went to Spoon tonight after happy hour for a fancy drink and for the bread basket which my friend had raved about.  The good: the bread basket was delicious with three breads. The portion was also great for two people.   The great: we ended up getting a cheese plate to go with bread. Yum! This was seriously an experience. We also each had a whiskey sour. They were so delicious with the peach liquor.  The reason to knock a star: the server was kind and knowledgable but hard to call over considering the half empty restaurant. He realized we wanted only the bread and drinks and when he learned that, he avoided us and giving us bread until we were willing to order the cheese despite his initial positive response to giving us bread with drinks. In the end I'm happy he kind of coerced us into the cheese because it was so good, but it was a little uncomfortable at the time.  We didn't get to try the extensive menu but we will definitely return when we can afford a full meal here! If it was a little more affordable I could see this being a restaurant to visit not infrequently.",

    "text": "I feel a little funny giving Spoon another 5 star review, but they've earned it once again. On a snowy December Saturday night, we decided to celebrate our recent engagement by heading to Spoon. I called ahead to see if they had tables, but there was nothing until 9pm (protip: they're on OpenTable). However, given the weather, the hostess thought there might be cancellations and suggested we check out the lounge for dinner or to wait out a table.  We headed over, and had another fantastic dining experience, though the menu had changed dramatically from my last visit. The bartender was our server and did a great job (also asked us if we were celebrating anything, and promptly brought us free champagne), and was able to figure out from my vague recollection (\"it was citrusy and French!\") what the vermouth drink I had so enjoyed previously had been (Dolin blanc with a twist of orange peel). While tables did not become available, we ended up sitting on the couches in front of the fireplace which is one of the more romantic settings I've seen...great for a date night! Things of note: The mushroom soup was the perfect starter on a cold evening--it was thick and comforting without being overly heavy. The crispy duck confit with Indian spices was amazing.  The fiance and I were fighting over the last few bites of the 3 grain salad. The baklava with poached pear and pear sorbet was absolutely delicious. I wasn't a fan of their \"Spoon bar\" dessert last time but I'm not a chocolate girl.  This was light and refreshing, not overly sweet, and the bartender must have told the kitchen staff about our celebration as it came out with \"Best Wishes\" written on it. And obviously there's the amazingness that is the bread, but other reviews have talked about how wonderful it is already, so I'll skip the details.  Bottom line, Spoon does amazing, creative food with a menu that changes frequently, and the bar/lounge menu gives lots of options for those looking for more of a tapas-style meal, with most plates between $8-$12. Others have commented on spotty service, but this bartender certainly earned her 30% tip.",

Awesome seared scallops and a killer lobster cake.  Ended the night with citrus sorbet that I can't stop thinking about!",

    "text": "I wrote this review in March of 2011, and forgot to submit it until now.   Out of all the superb restaurants I visited while on assignment in Pittsburgh, Spoon, I believe, was my favorite. There is something about stepping out of a cold winter night into a warm friendly atmosphere that makes it more special than any other time of year, and Spoon's surroundings are very inviting indeed. Like I always do at a new place, I sat at the bar to chat with the bartender and whoever else happened by.  Even being from the Southern United States, the hospitality masters, I have never felt more welcome than I did in Pittsburgh, and Spoon was no exception. Like every other place I visited in the 'Burgh, Spoon had friendly, warm inviting staff who couldn't wait to tell me more about their town and their restaurant.   Besides hospitality, Spoon offers classy sophisticated environs and food to match. Without exception, every single course was excellent, well timed, beautifully plated, and expertly explained. Like many other restaurants in Pittsburgh, Spoon prides themselves on serving locally-grown and produced foods whenever possible, always a plus in my book.  Spoon has the honor of having the single best breading that I have ever experienced in any restaurant, and I have eaten at Alinea in Chicago, The French Laundry in Yauntville and Alex in Vegas, three of the best restaurants in the United States. Spoon makes all their breads in-house (with the exception of the baguette but even that is locally made) and serve all of them hot, with whipped plugra honeybutter that you want to eat straight out of the ramekin.  You will experience a dill sweet corn muffin. This is a perfectly moist muffin. It is light and airy. It does not fall into the same trap that so many other muffins do of being dense. It compliments the meal and does not fill you up.  The cream cheese and chive biscuits are truly wonderful. A delicate, moist and perfectly sour buttermilk crumb holds sinful chunks of cream cheese hostage. I wanted to fill my pockets with these and take them back to my hotel room and mete them out throughout the week. They are that good.  I ordered the tasting menu, since I wanted to experience the whole panoply of flavors and textures the restaurant had to offer. I try to do this whenever possible since I also have trouble making decisions when confronted with a menu where there are clearly no wrong answers.  The amuse-bouche was a fennel soup with house-made sausage and red pepper coulis. It was truly excellent with a smooth texture and a slight sweetness lent by the sausage.   Next up was a yellowtail tuna sashimi with ponzu acids, a sesame vinagrette and seaweed salad. With fish dishes, it is often difficult to keep from overpowering the delicate flavor, but with this dish, the other elements complemented the flesh. This was a different take on sashimi and was as good as I've had anywhere.  Next was a novel take on the breakfast classic of bacon and eggs. This was a crispy yet tender hunk of pork belly with a perfectly soft boiled egg. Hollandaise sauce and spinach accompanied. I want to make a special note of the Hollandaise sauce here. It was not heavy and goopy like many other specimens of this sauce have been for me. From what I understand, this is a difficult thing to accomplish, but Spoon did it wonderfully. This was my favorite course, and I could eat this every day of my life and be blissful.  Another fish dish: Black cod miso with hot and sour mushroom broth and pork belly dumplings. Miso black cod is one of my favorite seafood dishes. I've had it at many superb restaurants such as Tomo in Austin and Nobu in Vegas. Highly touted Nobu actually comes in third here, with Spoon taking the title. This was truly superb. As a side not, it iis rare when one encounters perfect broccoli, but this dish included it as a side. The cod had a perfect texture as well; not mushy at all yet it yielded with ease to teeth and tongue.  The first beef course followed: Fillet and short rib. The small fillet hunk was cooked to a perfect medium-rare over a small arugula salad with goat cheese (always a winning combination). The short rib was (I believe) sous-vide to perfection, served with braising sauce. This cut of meat is always a winner, and not particularly difficult to do well, so I was not surprised at its excellence. It was served over potato-garlic puree, which hit all the right notes and sang the right song.  I did not write notes on the dessert, but I remember it being a wonderful chocolate concoction of some sort that was very good. I did opt for coffee afterward. It was an excellent roast served in a small french press with its own setting. It was very classy and served as a wonderful finale to the experience.   During this last aperitif, I had a wonderful conversation with a gentleman at the bar. But given the rest of my meal, and the rest of my Pittsburgh experience, that didn't surprise me either.",

    "text": "Boy took me to Spoon for a surprise Valentine's Day dinner! And yes, if I could rate him on Yelp he would get five stars.   The menu was prix fixe but one could choose from a handful of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  I'll break down our dinner by course:  1. Aperitifs: I had the sangria and boy had a whiskey neat. To be honest, the sangria was the weakest part of the meal. It was overly spiced, so much that I barely enjoyed it. This was my only complaint the whole evening.   2. Appetizers: Boy chose the \"bacon and eggs\", which was actually pork medallions with an egg served with spinach and hollandaise.  I had the cheese souffle with winter salad. Both were delicious. The salad was composed of fruits (apples and pears sliced very thin) and greens topped with balsamic dressing.  3. Entrees: Steak with mushroom/cheese strudel for me, and chicken \"two ways\" for him. My steak was cooked perfectly. Boy (one of the pickiest eaters on the planet) raved about his barley risotto. He claims that it was one of the best things he has ever eaten. So if anyone has a recipe, fork it over.   4. Dessert: We both had the chocolate spoon bar. Yummy.   I see other reviewers have amply commented about the side dishes, so I won't say too much except that the cream cheese/chive biscuits are super-addicting.   Overall, a fantastic evening. Good service. The restaurant treated every girl to a Valentine's Day rose. I will return.",

I usually try to stay away from the bread basket to save room for my meal, but you can not miss the wonderful assortment they have to offer.  The cocktail menu is fun and unique, as well.   The first time we went we each had an appetizer and entree, which were amazing.  Standouts would be the gorgonzola blue cheese souffle and the miso glazed fish. The second time it was Valentine's Day with a pre-fixed menu. Usually, I am a bit disappointed with this option, but everything was amazing! Most recently, we went for just drinks and appetizers.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  If you are looking for a consistently delicious meal with an upscale feel yet still laid back and comfortable, you can't go wrong with Spoon!  We hope to return soon!",

Pork Belly was cooked well, but the salad and BBQ sauce on the plate are not worthy of the meat.  Rabbit was very dry, and the pairings were strange (10 spears of asparagus and some type of yogurt puree).  My wife had the burger because she considered it to be the safest option....it was cooked well but very under seasoned.  The dessert I ordered was a complete failure in every way - Smore.  I sent it back as I could not even eat it.  The mixed drinks were very strange also.....too confusing and over complicated (and quite expensive)  There were four of us for dinner.....  1 appetizer 4 entrees 1 dessert 3 cocktails 3 glasses of wine  $200  Not worth the hype.  Not worth the money.  Not worth the time.  The staff was responsive, but not overly friendly.",

    "text": "Wow.  I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews.  Was I going to a place that was lacking on service, but food seemed great?    Well I'm here to tell you that the service, drinks, and dinner were all 5 stars.  The ice cream desserts, were only 3 stars though.  Still this equates to an overall 5 star experience to me.  First, we ordered some drinks at the bar because we arrived a little early.  I ordered the Fizzy Gin drink ... can't remember the exact name, but WOW.  Phenomenal flavor.  The bartender told us all of the ingredients in the drink and then even showed us how they injected the CO2 into the drink.    Next we were seated and explained the menu.  Our server whose name escapes me at this moment, was extremely bubbly and helpful with any questions we had.  The bread then came out.  The cornbread muffins were quite scrumptious.  The buttermilk biscuit w/cream cheese was also great.  Even the regular bread was excellent.  The butter came out with salt on top, which is a favorite small detail of mine.    I ordered the duo of lamb.  I believe it came with lamb loin and shoulder.  (could be wrong about the loin part).  It was served on a bed of greens and cooked medium rare.  It was pure perfection.  The flavors were just superb.  The shoulder portion came on a sort of very small cake of stuffing and was covered with sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Very good, but didn't have the wow factor that the other part of the entree had.  Nonetheless, it was thoroughly enjoyed.  Finally, the ice cream came.  I ordered the salted caramel.  It really lacked much caramel flavor and the salted part....?  I maybe got a hint of it?  Maybe?  Also, the ice cream itself was full of ice crystals.  I wondered if it sat in the freezer too long?  Compared to the rest of the meal, this was a bit disappointing.  However, I still finished it, as it was ice cream after all.    Overall, I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I am from Philadelphia. It is a great food town. Best meal I've ever had in my life? Was in Pittsburgh. At Spoon. Thank the lord for Carnegie Mellon graduation weekend.  Started off with the MOST AMAZING BREAD BASKET OF ALL TIME. Biscuits that were *gasp* filled with cheese. Mini *omg* corn muffins. Moist *aaaah* french bread. And the funny part is I never touch the bread basket. There that goes.  First course: Lobster \"Hot & Cold\" aka a cup of creamy, rich lobster bisque and a dill-heavy mini lobster roll. This was solid - but the bites of the Deconstructed Bahn Mi and the Asparagus Soup I tried blew the simple lobster dish out of the water. But lobster. Gotta love it.  Main: Miso Glazed Alaskan Black Cod. Best dish I may have ever been served in a restaurant. AND THERE WERE BONES IN IT. Under normal circumstances, I would have grabbed the waitress and sent her marching back to the kitchen in shame. But perched in an enticing bath of that glistening hot and sour broth over broccolini, shitakes and miso-brasied daikon? I spit 'em out and kept going. It was perfect. Salty, tangy, and rich - but light as air. Everything that miso and soy should be. The fish was *perfectly* cooked. The dumplings in the dish were an unnecessary afterthought. I ignored them. Overall - amazing.  Other mains I tried were alright. The braised short ribs were amazing. The housemade chorizo? Alright. But my dish. The cod? The cod was unbelievable.  Dessert: salted caramel ice cream. Perfect ending. But be aware: THE CHEESECAKE HAS POP ROCKS. POP ROCKS.  Enough said.  Just to dump the other notes: the service was top notch - well timed courses, and attentive bus staff. My waitress suggested the cod, and for that I owe her everything. Casual, but elegant, vibe. Don't get the sangria - it was mostly water. Do bring lots of money and/or a sugar daddy. It's expensive.  Do I recommend? Hell yes.",

They also automatically split the appetizer we were sharing onto two plates without us asking.   Overall the service was top notch.   The food was also outstanding.

    "text": "Spoon is a place I would say is definitely worth visiting if you're in the Pittsburgh area. My girlfriend and I were up in Pittsburgh in early March for a concert at the Petersen, and after looking at a few different places, we decided on Spoon because we loved the menu and it was close enough to our venue.  Walking into Spoon there is definitely a modern feel to the restaurant. The decor was pretty contemporary (my girlfriend ate dinner sitting on the most turquoise booth/couch you have ever seen), there were weird pictures of spoons everywhere, and there was damn good 80's music playing overhead at the perfect volume.  We started off with some Rose champagne while we looked over the menu. Great pour on the champagne. We ordered the Octopus empanada and then selected our entrees. Before the empanada came out, bread service was brought out. DELICOUS bread. There was a sort of herbacious biscuit, some sourdough, and a sweet cornbread. Butter complimented them all very well. Love a good bread selection.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really get behind the empanada - which is a bummer because I love them. The octopus inside was a little fishy for my taste, and I'm not a huge fan of capers. On the flip side, my girlfriend loved it, so definitely a preference thing on the empanada.  Our entrees were brought out shortly after the first, and all was right with the world again. I ordered the lamb shank gnocchi with pecorino, rosemary, pine nuts, and pomegranate. I haven't ever had something like a mean gnocchi with pomegranate but I thought it was really well done! There weren't too many pomegranate seeds in there so it was a nice sweet bite when one snuck its way onto your fork.   We ended the meal with a glass of wine each, and once again they were not stingy with the pours. Service was good all meal long.  Although I wish I could have maybe tried a different first course, the overall meal was great. Definitely recommend stopping by here if you want a nice meal that won't break your bank!",

    "text": "This was one of my first finer dining experiences here in Pittsburgh. I came here on a Saturday evening at 8:30. The menu is contemporary American, and it features Appetizers, Main Courses, Vegetables, and Desserts (separate menu). While these options seemed deliciously great, the Family Style 4-course was the option my date and I went with. It's $45 per person, and each person gets 4 courses: one appetizer, one lighter dish, one entree, and one dessert.   The portions were plentiful. Each course was as follows:  1) Korean BBQ Bibb Lettuce Wraps 2) Scallops with Blood Oranges 3) Chicken on Polenta and Lentils 4) Pineapple Caramel Bread Pudding   My date was hungry, so he also ordered the Lamb Shank, which was equally amazing.   No pictures were taken, as we don't do phones on date nights, but you can bet yourselves that the food was visually appealing and looked as good as it sounds.   As a side note: the alcohol selection was amazing - while I forgot the names of the beers we ordered, they were high quality, refreshing and clean IPAs.",

All the staff from the hostess to our waitress were beyond amazing. Very friendly and efficient service the entire visit.   I was warned by friends about Spoon's small portions, so I made sure to order enough to fill me up. As a vegetarian, I was disappointed to find that there were no entree options that worked with my dietary restrictions, so my options were limited to their \"firsts\" menu (aka the small plates). I ordered the winter salad, roasted turnips, and my favorite, the cumin crepe. Nothing special about the winter salad - just mixed greens and raw veggies that anyone can toss together. I would not recommend. The roasted turnips were surprisingly very delicious. They were tossed in honey and peppers which gave it a subtle hint of sweet and spicy. However, it was the cumin crepe that stole the show for me. If you love Indian food, this is a must try! It is a crepe stuffed with cauliflower tikka masala that's topped with a creme fraiche drizzle - so tasty and a unique addition to the menu.   If you have room after your meal, I highly recommend the waffle! If you don't have room - make room! Probably one of my favorite desserts I've tried at a fine dining restaurant (and trust me, I've had plenty - more than I'm proud to admit). It's a waffle that's loaded with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream and marshmallow. I'm not ashamed to admit I ate more than my share but #noragrets.",

Our waitress was very nice and they have a decent brunch menu with many options from sweet to savory.  I went with the lemon ricotta crepes topped with fruit and served with a salad. It was served with 3 very small crepes that were cold and a healthy portion of salad but no toppings.  I was pretty disappointed as I left hungry after spending $14 for this entree.",

I was really disappointed after coming here this weekend with my brunch club.  Other than our group of 6, there was only one other table seated, and a couple people at the bar.  It was almost like we had rented the space for a private party.   There is a limited, yet nice, variety of breakfast options.  I chose the confit chicken burrito.  Initially it was to come with a fried egg on top but the chef was doing a scramble mix.  It was just \"ok\".  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  It was served with a side of mixed greens, which were barely dressed.  And by side, I mean about a half cup.   The service was ok, although we did have to wait for coffee refills a few times.  The waitress was very personable though and answered everyone's questions.  My friend had the \"Sloppy Dan\" which was a sausage slider.  That looked really good, served with a side of fries.  She confirmed that it was tasty. I need to come back and try dinner, which I've heard is quite good.",

One of my fav places. But now I have options! So good!!!  Sweet corn ice cream. The last part of my meal, the first thing I think about. Doesn't sound like something you'd order, right? But holy crap was it AMAZING!! Wow.   We went here for our anniversary hoping for a great dining experience and that's just what we had! From the moment we valet parked the car at the door ($3!) to the moment we left, every bit was spectacular. Food, atmosphere, service.. all spot on. I started with the Korean fried chicken app with whipped miso, gochujang (have no idea what that is but it's damn tasty) and a fried egg on top. Decadent. My wife opted for the melon salad, a seemingly innocent, mundane sounding choice but I'm here to tell you it was anything but! When did you last have a meat pickle of hangar steak? Just what I thought. OMG.   Entrees were the scallops for my wife and swordfish for me. Ok, I know what you're thinking. Boring. Ha. You would be SO WRONG!!  I rarely order swordfish but this preparation was so intricate and layered with flavors that I'm not sure I'll ever have its equal. The raisin chutney on there just knocked my socks off. And my wife's scallops? Huge, so fresh, perfectly cooked with complex flavors that kept you wanting more. I admit to having a couple bites... And yes, the biscuits people rave about were indeed good.   And for those reviewers who have complained about pricing I say this - get the burger. It's inexpensive. But if you want a high quality meal, fair pricing, superbly prepared food, and a memorable experience, get here. I'll be back. And it will be before my next anniversary!!",

We'd been here for drinks at the bar before but until last night didn't realize what a gem of a restaurant we'd been missing. Well now we know and we won't wait long to return. The chef's tasting menu with red snapper followed by lamb shank sounded amazing but last night we decided to order on our own.   We had great selections of wine by the glass and since I drink white and hubby drinks red, this is important to us. The bread basket with tasty little muffins and a creamy chive spread started us off. Initially we both wanted to share a first course of Korean Fried Chicken but after I heard the description of the melon salad with beets, peaches, tomatoes and hangar steak meat pickle, we each ordered our own starters. Both were absolutely terrific and we enjoyed sharing them.   I really wanted the Scallops for dinner and I am now spoiled for life on my choice! They were huge and pure perfection. Cooked medium and spiced delightfully with so many complex flavors with the creamy sauce and basil vinaigrette, summer veggie succotash and roasted fresh corn aioli. My husband ordered the Swordfish and he was equally happy and excited by his dish.   We ordered the cantaloupe coconut & sweet corn sorbets for our desserts which came plated with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the dish. Very sweet touch we both appreciated and light, refreshing desserts after a big meal.   Our server was charming, attentive and excellent at describing the finer points of the dishes. Everyone from our server, food runners and the manager made a point of wishing us Happy Anniversary. Thank you Spoon for making our day so special - we'll see you again soon!!!!",

My only complaint is that my vegetarian friends had difficulty finding something that they could eat on the menu. They ended up getting salads and sides of roasted carrots, which they claimed to be delicious. A little more selection for vegetarians would have been nice.",

Service was inconsistent and slow, and surprisingly the food tasted bland.  Blue cheese souffle hardly had a hint of blue cheese taste, and the steak was under seasoned.

All of you Red Lobster bread fanatics need to try the bread here. Also love their dessert, especially the Spoon Bar (\"Bailey's cocoa bar, milk chocolate nougat frozen mousse, semi-sweet chocolate pudding\"). I've also tried their bourbon ice cream. Can't say I absolutely loved it, but it was definitely interesting. I think they tend to have interesting ice cream flavors.  I've never really been happy with any of their other items I've tried. These items include the foie gras terrine, celery soup, pork shoulder, cassoulet, and sorbet. The cassoulet was a disappointment. It sounded great on the menu, but it turned out that the egg was the best part of it; everything else just did not stand out and the beans were especially tasteless.   Hard to rate a place when you have mixed feelings. My rating of 3.5 out of 5 doesn't mean it's average; it means I both love and don't really like Spoon (just depends on the item we're talking about).   I usually experience good service here and wouldn't mind coming back. But next time I come, it might just be for the bread basket (which I dream about regularly) and Spoon Bar and I will have no shame.

We were here on a Tuesday night, it was pretty slow and only a few tables in the restaurant were filled. We had made a reservation on OpenTable but didn't seem like we needed one for a Tuesday!  For dinner, we heard about the 4 course family meal but one person wasn't wanting that much so we decided to order individual entrees. They did allow us to get the appetizer from the group meal which was ceviche. It was pretty good, and they made a bigger portion of it so we could share. The bread / toast was sooo hard though, it was really hard to bite into and was cutting the roof of our mouths so we just opted to eat the ceviche plain.   For dinner I had the ravioli. It was alright, I didn't care for it that much to be honest, but it wasn't bad. Not sure that helps, but I wish I had had the fish or seafood bowl thing (can't remember the name).   We skipped dessert as we were all full, but sounded like they had good stuff.  Overall it was a good experience, I'd be willing to go back to try something different and hopefully more appetizing.",

    "text": "Oh, Spoon. We gave this fine establishment a shot when we were feeling fancy for dinner one night. It came highly recommended based on Yelp and friend reviews. I had been dying to try it out myself for months now so I was excited when we settled on there for dinner.  Oh, boy. I really loved the decor and the low lighting. I like any ambiance that makes it feel like an official date night (even if \"we're\" not calling it that ;). We chose to sit at the bar as the next earliest reservation was for 8.30PM (it was 6PM at the time), which was funny because for the two hours we were there the restaurant stayed half-empty.  The bar is wide enough to accommodate meal-eatin' so we were just fine up there. The bartender service started off a tad slow, as in almost non-existent. It seemed like they were both tired, but by the end of the night they had picked it up and were more chatty and aware.  We started off splitting the duck 3 ways. The confit cake was super delicious, the breast lacked any discernable flavor, and the liver mousse was just bad. The grilled peaches paired well with the confit cake, but the balsamic reduction added nothing to anything on the plate. We actually noticed that they seem to like to put purees and reductions with a lot of their dishes where it doesn't fit or make sense. Instead of the balsamic mixing well to enhance the flavor of the item, it just felt like it sat on top and you could distinctly taste balsamic and whatever else you were eating. Just getting the peaches and confit cake would have been ok with us.  Bread basket, as everyone has noted, was absolutely delicious. Their cornbread is amazingly good as is the honey butter.  For entrees I ordered the chicken two ways since it is what everyone raves about and he got striped bass. Neither dish impressed us much. There was just something lacking about my chicken. Maybe I was expecting too much from it since Eleven has the most amazing roasted chicken in the city (no lie). The walnut stuffed leg and couscous were pretty good, but the breast was bland and the peach puree made no sense. And I have no clue what honey lemon essence they were referring to on the plate. The striped bass was just weird. The foam on top did NOTHING for the dish. On the plus side, the veggies were tasty!  If I had to describe Spoon, it would be that it is a fancy place pretending to serve good food. They have fancy decorations, fancy looking dishes, but it's all surface level. It's not \"bad\" food, per se. It's just not very good for what you are paying.",

The decor was very nice - it gave the feel that you were somewhere special without throwing it in your face or being over-the-top.  They also had a few holiday lights above the bar, which I appreciated.  Service was great - the waiters and runners were all very knowledgeable about the ingredients and offered recommendations.  I started with a glass of sangria (pretty straight-forward).  I enjoyed a couple selections from the bread basket (served warm) before my appetizer of the mushroom soup with crab ravioli came.  The soup was very rich and thick.  The taste was smooth, but I'll probably try something else next time.  My main course was the scallops with smoked brisket, which were cooked perfectly.  It was served with cabbage and parsnip puree, which I thought was an excellent combination.  The serving sizes were what you would expect from an upscale restaurant - you leave feeling full but there are no leftovers.  I also thought the price tag for the quality and service provided was very appropriate.  I'm looking forward for another excuse to go back!",

Sometimes, you go somewhere and it is all about the visual and then the taste of the actual meal is... ok.  At Spoon, you pay and they deliver.  My guest had the hanger steak entree and started with a gorgonzola souffle that looked, again, out of this world.  The wine selection was stellar.  I am deep in late fall/winter mode with my red wine obsession.  The Malbec on the wine list (if there were 2, this was the $11-$12 one) was a delight.

    "text": "My experience can best be summed up as: underwhelming.   I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm going to try to give Spoon the benefit of the doubt, hope they were having an 'off' night, and try 'em again..sometime. But, for now, I'm a staunch 3-starrer.   We decided to dine here on a random Tuesday evening. There were a few other tables inhabited by an elderly man and his buxom 20-something date (way too much cleav to be his granddaughter, for realz), and a few 40-something groups that were rather loudly discussing things affluent or wannabe-affluent people discuss (islands to vacation on, etc.). I wasn't real into that, but whatevs. Spoon can't tell them to STFU, after all.   We were seated by one of the big windows in the section to the right of the entrance, and as I turned around to look out that window, I noticed a thick layer of dust on the sill, as well as several dead flies. Yuck. Not appetizing to say the least. Then, I looked at the fire exit door, which was right behind my bf (we were wedged into a corner two top). There were lines of grease (WD 40?) running down the door. Kiiiinda gross. So, I didn't love that.  Our waitress was pretty good, although quite wide-eyed and speaking super fast, like she was on amphetamines, haha. Regardless, she gave us the time we needed and food came out correctly, so service was solid.   Now, as for the food... The 'bacon and eggs' was rad. Love me some pork belly, and theirs did not disappoint! The egg, hollandaise, and asparagus all complemented the pork perfectly. Oh, and yes, like errybody said - those cheesy biscuits are AWESOME. However, the main courses were merely meh.  My bf got the salmon and I got the pasta. He said his salmon was just \"not that great\", and he didn't finish his meal, which is rare, especially because he loves salmon. My pasta was in a cream sherry sorta sauce, and I love those kinda sauces, but it was just so bland. Plus, the micro greens on top both annoyed me (Grow up, micro greens! I don't need any hoity toity baby leaves.), and competed with the flavor of the sauce (what little there was, at least) rather than complementing it.   In short: I just wasn't that into it. My leftovers came home with me and wound up hanging out in the fridge until I tossed 'em out on garbage night. And few things suck more than dropping over $120 on a Tuesday night dinner you wind up chucking. I'm hoping my next Spoon experience isn't the same!",

I enjoyed a scallops dish while the rest of my group dined on burgers, the fish of the day and pork respectively.

    "text": "Dined at Spoon for my 30th birthday. What a great experience!! These folks aren't kidding about the bread basket, it's delightful. My mother had eaten at Chef Brian's other restaurants in San Francisco and San Diego, and we were pleased to see that he was just named Pittsburgh's top chef of 2012. Sadly, he wasn't there, as we wanted to meet him, but we did get to talk with his assistant, Chef Dave, for a while. What a great guy!  I should also note that our server, I think his name was Ralph, was wonderful. Honestly, this is the best service I have had in a long long time. Completely attentive and very helpful.   Two appetizers... The Gorgonzola Souffle was truly wonderful. Rich, but light. The Turf on Surf (that we \"made fly\" with the addition of seared foie gras) was awesome; the braised short rib was so tender and juicy, and the lobster cake with lobster hollandaise was unreal.  Entrees... Duck two ways had two duck breasts served over perfectly braised carrots and also a crispy duck salad. Both were top notch. The Lamb plate had braised lamb over a mushroom bread pudding (great textural contrast) and I believe the other side of the plate had roasted lamb. I didn't try my husbands scallops, nor would he have let me if I wanted to.  Desserts... We ordered three (gulp), and Chef Dave sent us a fourth. That was awesome! All in all, we got everything except for the cheese plate. The Spoon Bar has rightfully earned its place among the top 100 desserts in America. The Almond Cake with Gelee and Macerated Fruit was so fresh and delicious. The \"strawberry\" dessert was a high-level take on a Pittsburgh party staple, the Jell-O Preztel Salad. This is the first time I've ever felt fancy eating those favors together. It was fabulous! Also, Chef Dave sent us a banana chocolate custard tart, which was, of course, lovely.   Spoon was fabulous, we are already looking forward to trying out their new Cranberry location.",

Six of us had salads, Caesar, the house greens and the lobster beat,  all artistically prepared and tasty.  We all wished they were larger portions!  The bread basked contained two very yummy muffins, a dill-corn muffin and a cheese muffin, both delish!  I had the tandoori salmon dish for my entree, nice size portion (gave 1/2 the fish to my hubby)--deliciously prepared with lentils and curried onion and peppers.  I loved all of the flavors and textures.  My husband had the scallop dish, they were cooked perfectly!    For dessert our table ordered a couple portions of the lemon poppyseed pound cake and chocolate mousse cake--yummy but too small of a portion, even for one!  Mixed cocktails and wine by the glass were pricey, but I guess you have to expect that at a new trendy restaurant!  I would go back, without a doubt.

The servers were very attentive and did everything possible to make our experience memorable, and the food was wonderful.  I started with the blue cheese gorgonzola souffle, which right now is being served with a stone fruit salad.  (Mine was almost all peaches with a few plum slices.)  By itself the souffle would have been too overpowering, but alternated with bites of the salad, it made for a very balanced dish.  My main course was chicken two ways, which has been described here by others, so I'll just say that it was a wonderful choice and surprisingly filling.  For dessert, I had peach-sage sorbet, which was divine!  My husband is never quite as sure of himself in a fancy place like this, but he had a very good experience as well.  He started with the prawns and cantaloupe, which he liked very much (although he was a little freaked out that the prawns were served entire).  Next, he had the barbecued brisket, which was served with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and coleslaw.  He thought the coleslaw, which contained red peppers and several other unusual vegetables, was a little strange, but he ate it all, and he thought the other components of the entree were very good.  For dessert, he had brown sugar-cinnamon ice cream.  It was a little bland for my taste, but he enjoyed it very much.  I doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to dine at Spoon again, but it was a memorable meal and worth every penny.",

So I get the restaurant tried to make their menu like a Michelin star restaurant. But man, if you ever went to one, you should know their chef menu or tasting menu serve each person a plate each course, people don't share one plate, especially if they pay for 2 person's price. Otherwise, you should say it on the menu.   Also, I had never seen a restaurant charged money for the bread before dinner. They were really good breads. It just made me feel weird and didn't get what I paid. Food was ok tho, a lil rip off like people never went to a good restaurant.  Just imagine, if you choose chef menu, you can choose any of your course and you ended up paying more than if you just choose your course. Doesn't make sense at all!

The (men's) bathroom is 1 urinal 1 stall but never was really a problem.   The experience overall though was just lacking...  (1) asked for no cheese in my braised lamb, still came with cheese. Lactose intolerance generally just sucks but I'd hope I could manage to get my food without cheese if asked.  (2) can servers be passive aggressive? I think our younger age dissuaded her from being able to cater to us. Maybe we were too raucous but I guess birthdays bring a lot of energy out of us. We had to ask for the drink menu multiple times because everytime we ordered, she'd take it back. Might be a restaurant thing if there's not enough for tables to keep them but that was annoying.  (3) She didn't introduce herself (unless I missed it, honestly) which always annoys me about waiters/waitresses but that's a personal problem anyway. (4)  On one hand, servers not letting the customers handle water I understand especially for hygiene reasons so that's fine. But it was still an awkward interaction overall.  (5) One of the friends I went with asked what kind of cut the steak dish was using, and she didn't know or offer to try to find out for him. She just vouched for how good it was which didn't really give any confidence in it so he ended up ordering something else. (6) Places give birthday desserts, I get it. The birthday girl said she specifically did not want anything and the waitress still pressed to see what kind of flavor profile she likes despite the birthday girl's protests. Yes it was only one scoop of ice cream but way to invalidate an individual's preferences and make her double check her blood sugar.    I do feel bad asking her to split the check 7 ways though. That was definitely our bad.   Service was pretty bad, but I do understand some of the mistakes could be ascribed to other departments like the bar taking a while to mix drinks for a large table or the kitchen missing if she wrote no cheese on my order.   As for price vs. Quality, I didn't really like the taste of my braised lamb but the Dan Dan noodles had a nice complex flavor. I definitely won't be coming back. I could have spent that much money elsewhere for better quality but the ol fashioned was good.",

Nevertheless, Chris our waiter was very solicitous. We had plans for after-dinner drinks and dancing and so just ordered the endive salad (rather bitter), a hamburger with the best fries, and the tuna poke, which was delightful. Second choice was the shrimp with prawns, but I wasn't feeling like all that pasta. Next time I'll skip the fries and splurge my carbs on one of their delicious-sounding desserts. Valet parking for $3 was totally worth it (and the $2 tip).",

Our server asked if anyone had a food allergy and explained how they would work around situations like an allergy to shellfish. I ordered the Celery soup to start. The Firsts at Spoon are not shareable for a table, though two might share the Pierogi or Shellfish appetizers. I ordered the Wild Boar Ragu as my Main. It is a pasta dish and I enjoyed it very much. Spoon also supplied a basket of bread, biscuits and mini muffins. Very good. We want to return.  Valet parking is available for $3 at this writing. Be sure to have your check validated.",

Service is spectacular and the vibe is both classy yet relaxed. They bring out an assortment of breads, all of which are tasty to complement the meal. My friend ordered a burger, which I didn't care much for, but I had the lamb shank which was braised properly. Still, I find myself coming back for their gin cocktails, they are totally worth trying!",

The space itself is not huge, but has a great layout. We ended up sitting in the \"lounge area\" which consisted of a few oversized chairs (very comfy I might add) and a fireplace! We were in no mood for a 5 course meal, so this seating area worked wonderful for a drink and some appetizers. All of us were pleasantly surprised at how great the food was. The size of the dishes was not large by any means, but with the price (very reasonable) and the quality of the food... we were very impressed!   I can't wait to come back, and have a sit down type dinner here.   Highly recommend!",

I was in a group of 5; when there wasn't 5 seats at the bar, the hostess told us we could stay in the lounge area, which totally worked out! We each ordered something different and everything was great! The blue cheese souffle was bomb but the real winner was the Dan Dan Noodle appetizer!!! It's an Asian style bolognese with a fried egg on top. Sounds a little weird but it was AMAZING. Everything was so great, including the space, ambiance, and service.

Our waiter was not only able to describe the components of each dish but he was also able to describe how they taste and he did it all with patience. For an appetizer we ordered the ricotta dumplings. They were delish! The bread basket had an assortment of breads which was perfect for me because I love variety. For an entree, I ordered the Heritage farm chicken plate. Soooooooo good! I also tried some of the octopus and the halbuit. They were both scrumptious.

The FOH staff were very lovely and apologetic when we had to wait.  Our waitress was very friendly and the service was prompt.  The atmosphere is inviting and I really liked the decorations and music playing.  Also there was a fireplace which I love.  The bad part: the food was not good at all.  I started with the blue cheese souffle and it had a side salad that was the best part of my whole meal.  My dinnermate started with the beet pirogies which I thought was the best thing we were served.  The second course was the wild boar ragu which was fine but it's main selling point seemed to be that it was a big portion.  The flavor was lacking and it was a bit watery.  The third course was a strawberry pavlova.  It was *extremely* sweet.  I was surprised that they would top a sweet pavlova with an even sweeter cream.  It was surrounded with freeze dried strawberry powder which I didn't care for and a couple small slices of strawberries.  I had a few bites but could not finish it.  When I made the reservation, they did not list that they would be serving a Valentine's Day menu.  Had I seen that they would have a different menu, I would have skipped it.  I don't mind throwing down some cash when it comes to having a nice meal but this felt like a lot of money for a very forgettable meal.",

    "text": "Quick review: spotty service, okay food, nice ambiance  We visited Spoon in early January with a reservation for 5. We arrived a little early and waited for a few minutes, however the table was ready by the time we had reserved it, so we were pleased (and pleased to have been sat in the back corner, far from the door in a cozy booth).   Service:  We sat for a while wondering who was actually our server, and after a male took a drink order from 1 out of 5 of us and left, we assumed it was him. It was not - a mousy female came over whose voice we could barely hear over the average noise level in the restaurant. Our initial impression of her - detached, distracted, and perhaps embarrassed, proved to be True for the rest of the evening.   I'm not one to constantly complain about service, but when your plates reach upwards of $30+, I expect a server who can at least properly take an order from the table. The wrong appetizer appeared, then the right one appeared several minutes later. We found ourselves waiting too long for things other than food - water, the check, an answer to a simple question. Believe the other reviewers that service will at best be spotty.   Food:  Among the 5 of us, we had a few hamburgers, the roasted pork, and the mushroom soup, while I ordered the scallops. Specifically: seared day boat scallops (5), smoked brisket + cabbage (like tiny sweet golabki), duck fat mashed potatoes, parsnip puree (the two were seemingly mashed together with little detection of the delicious umami of duck fat), sour apple sauce, and pine nut aioli. $27 I know what you're thinking: goodness, that sounds like a lot! Well, it was - palate wise, but was in fact a relatively small serving of food, especially compared to the portions on other plates. All in all, the mish-mash of flavors was not cohesive at all and the dish needed to be edited.   I had a taste of the burger and it was good. The fries were good as well, especially the aioli that accompanied them. Come to think of it, though - either my plate was missing the \"pine nut aioli\" or it was incredibly un-memorable.   Ambiance: The interior was well decorated and had a very trendy and typical feel for a place like this. It gave the impression that the restaurant is new and current. It was cozy without being too comfortable, airy without being too sterile. Good, warm lighting.   I think with a different server and a different dish, it could have been a 5 star evening! Alas, with the multitudes of restaurants in the area I don't think I'll return during another jaunt to Pittsburgh, but I certainly could have done much worse. A-OK.",

The tasting option was a great deal - $65. We got to taste 5 different things on the menu, all fantastic. There was no dish that was disappointing. I would not hesitate to come back and I think I would always go with the chef's tasting - I was told it changes every night. Would have loved to have done the $35 wine pairing option, but this was a martini night for me. The main course was a beef dish served two way - delicious. Skirt fish appetizer was also a favorite.   As a small side not, a friend dining with me told the waiter he did not eat pork and to exclude this on any of the chef's tastings. Two of the 5 dishes were served with pork and had to be sent back. Seems like they had a hard time handling that request.  Great food -- 4 stars only because of the repeated confusion with the pork and the fact that the martini was just alright, I was expecting great in light of the food that was served. Also ordered the \"blue franc\" wine by Blue Star, wonderful, give it a shot.",

First off I did not get a stuffy closed off atmosphere from the place. I found the place to be spacious, and I didn't feel cramped...maybe I went on a more quiet day...when the hipsters weren't around...I found Spoon to be what I was looking for. Nothing to busy, and portions that are just right. The entree I wanted was not available that night so I stuck with apps. I had the Steak Tartare, the Fois Gras and the blue cheese souffle. My other half has the fish dish. Everything was prepared well. I especially liked the bone marrow custard of sorts that came with my tartare, and had a much better experience with Fois Gras here, than I did at another establishment. My other half (does that sound pretentious?) had the fish which was perfectly cooked if maybe on the smaller end portion wise. My only gripe was the blue cheese souffle that needed a pop more flavor. Some sort of berry compote would have helped...and of course we ended the night with the spoon dessert which was super good. I wanted a more upscale experience while I was visiting, and I believe Spoon delivered. I would come back again..and no I don't wear plaid",

Overall the experience was fine, but not particularly outstanding in any way. The ambiance and decorations were about par for the price range. Food was good, but was quite fussy and had somewhat muddled flavor profiles.   We started with scallops with foie gras and seared baby octopus. The scallops were completely overwhelmed by the foie gras. The octopus was unexciting, though well cooked. The bread basket that everyone was raving about was nice, but nothing that I would write home about. The entrees were a pan seared fish and a pork belly. Both were fine, but continued the theme of contrasting textures and flavors that didn't work well on the same plate. We passed on dessert.  Wine list was again adequate, and they are able to source beers from sister restaurant BRGR next door. Service was prompt and attentive.   Overall impression was a fine dining establishment that had the usual bells and whistles, but fell short in execution. Feels like the kitchen is trying to put too much on one plate, and ended with a confused experience for the diner.  After reading some of the other reviews, I must say that the comparsions to top restaurants in other major cities are misplaced. It's a nice place, but would not get a blip in places like NYC or bay area.",

I just wasn't super excited about my entree or dessert.  It's possible I just didn't order the right, but I felt like my short ribs were sort of tougher than they should have been and that I really could have gone for more than just a tiny bite of the sides, which were tasty but I felt like I didn't get to enjoy them because they were gone so quickly.  I would have really enjoyed at least two more bites of those duck fat whipped potatoes.     I'm usually one to complain that the portions are absurdly large, but I felt in this case they were a  too small since the meat really didn't carry the entree and the appetizers had been pretty small too. My date, though, did not have that problem with his shrimp and grits, more than enough grits on his plate.  But that would be just stingy not to, am I right, I mean they're grits...They did have nice bread and butter, but who wants to fill up on that?   Especially when the most appealing dessert that evening was a variation of pain perdue...which is of course is french toast.  It may be time to admit that I'm just never impressed with egg dipped and fried bread...  You know, it is a good date place though because you definitely don't feel too full to make out immediately after.",

The ambiance made a magnificent first impression; I felt like I really stepped into a special, quiet enclave removed from the rest of the world.  Our waitress was very helpful in explaining the drink menu.  She even brought out a sample of Pimm's, which I had never heard of.  As others have said, the bread basket is divine, rivaling top restaurants in New York.  Biscuits and cornbread are two of my favorite types of bread, but the baguette was a little boring.  We shared the duck 2 ways as an appetizer, and they split it into two beautifully plated dishes!  The confit cake was one of the best ways I've ever tasted duck.  Peaches and balsamic were a nice way to balance out the flavor profile.  Presentation remained a highlight of the meal as the entrees came out.  My halibut dish looked like a piece of art, with the fish highlighted in the middle and tower-like shrimp cakes anchoring the corners.  My girlfriend's scallop dish was also elegantly plated, and quite tasty too.  Another aspect that stood out was the combination of two different proteins or preparations in each entree.  They offered delicious variety without fragmentation.  Having eaten a heavy lunch, we were too full to continue on with dessert, but the descriptions didn't look terribly interesting anyway.  Spoon is an ideal venue for a special meal, providing an exquisite contemporary atmosphere without sacrificing taste and innovation.",

But in fact, the portion is bigger and the food here is quite filling. I really appreciate the bread basket w three different types of bread. The one w sour cream inside is my fav. We ordered the salad and hominy chicken hot pot for apps, hardskin sea bass and dayboat scallops for main dish and carrot cake and tiramisu as desserts. The apps are really good and filling our appetite perfectly. My hot pot isn't spicy at all but is still nice and tasty. As for entree, I LOVE the texture of the scallops with its outside seared nicely and inside a little wet and jelly-like, just yummmm. My friend's sea bass is quite nice too. The meat is really tender and the grits are cheesy and tasty. However, our entree are all really salty, a sarcasm for a eatery known for food quality and healthy portion size. Besides, the desserts are kinda plain. Although the tiramisu has green tea powder on top, which does not make it stand out, it is generally normal and okayish. Our carrot cake does not taste of carrots and is disappointingly too sweet to our taste. Apart from that, the waiter does introduce the everyday specials to the table next to us but he totally forgets to inform us. So, uh uh sorry Spoon, but points off!",

The swordfish literally melted in my mouth, and I was also able to enjoy the Tahona Club Cocktail as well as a glass of white wine. I have no complaints about the food. I really love farm to table restaurants, and I have enjoyed sharing this type of restaurant with my parents who are new to the concept.   That being said, Spoon has some pretty hefty price tags that definitely made me cringe as a college student. If I wasn't with my parents, I would not have eaten as lavishly as I did, but hey, I just turned 21, so I took advantage of the system. In essence, if you can afford the beauty that is Spoon, treat yo' self, but if you are a meager college student like myself, make sure you check prices online before you commit to the reality of the farm to table world.",

I had been scrolling through Yelp trying to find something exactly like this, when my colleague beat me to it and declared this was where we would be dining.   We walked here from Bakery Square (which I wouldn't do in the daylight if you are not intrepid, and I would not do at night at all). The restaurant is beautiful in an understated, and chic way. The service was very good from beginning to end. We were promptly greeted and seated (we had reservations) at a beautiful corner table.   I remember taking a very long time perusing the menu and trying to decide what to have. It all looked really delicious. There were also many options for omnivores, carnivores, vegetarians, pescatarians (I'm not sure about vegan). I try not to eat mammals, but everything looked delicious. They serve fresh and locally-sourced food as much as possible.  I chose a salad (the menu seems to change that was amazing!) and my colleagues got the blue cheese souffle and said it was dreamy. They also both ordered the hanger steak, which they found to be delicious as well. I had a seasonal fish entree that was divine.   The wine was also dreamy. Make sure the peruse the wine list. The descriptions are delightful and spot-on!   Our only complaint was that we could not keep our wine away from the gnats. I wasn't too flummoxed by it, but one of our party was a little distracted by the issue.  When it came time to go, we asked the waitress if a cab could be called for us. She said the cabs in Pittsburgh are famously slow and unreliable, and the restaurant called a \"car service\" for us. It was literally a dude in his minivan, but he arrived quickly and took us right back to the hotel. :)  I will definitely drop in here again when I am in Pittsburgh. I would love to sample more of the seasonal menu items and try a few of the \"regulars,\" too. The tasting menus look delightful as well.",

While, on a Monday night at 8:00 PM, my roommate and I had no trouble snagging a table without a reservation.  I have pretty high standards for my five star reviews: I have to have the best \"something\" I've ever had in order to hand one out, and it has to be good.  I had the best vodka gimlet I've ever had from the bar.   Food-wise, I also had a really tasty iceberg salad, tomatoes with tons of flavor, everything really fresh, local produce.  My main course was a pork tenderloin which had an incredible, slightly sweet sauce and laid on top of polenta, and corn on the cob that was perfectly seasoned in some kind of cheese (?) sauce.  it was delicious.  I already mentioned the gimlet, but the wine list was also good, with top-notch wines for respectable prices, given this city's obscene liquor laws.  The desserts all sounded really good, but I didn't eat any.  My roommate and I couldn't come up with a single negative comment about our meal here, the atmosphere or the service.  They don't even make the staff wear uniforms (I hated it when I worked in restaurants as a teenager).     According to the staff, rather than overwork their kitchen, they will just not fill all the tables if they get a rush.  That's pride in quality work, but let's see how long they can keep that up in this economy.  I normally take a star away for food this pricey, but it was honestly worth it.  Best new restaurant in Pittsburgh this summer.",

    "text": "WOW! This place is divine.   We got a reservation off Open Table and came here with a friend on Saturday night, and we started off with a glass a wine; they had an excellent selection. Next came the awesome bread basket. OMG whatever those rolls were with the cream cheese, were beyond incredible.   We started out with Corn Soup which came with a yellow pepper stuffed with cous cous and shrimp, and fresh herbs. It was probably the best, most fresh thing I ate the entire weekend. The corn soup was pureed with a little bit of corn mixed throughout, it was very creamy and pretty good.   I got the Cast Iron roasted game hen and it was a little too pink for my enjoyment. I did eat the part that was well done, however. It also was not as nicely presented as the other plates that I saw walking out. But the vegetables and sauce that the hen was laid in was very tasty.   My friend had the Maryland Crab stuffed trout and it was beautifully presented, and it looked divine. She said it was fabulous. And would definitely return for it again.   For dessert we got the Spoon Bar and it was very delicious and incredibly chocolatey.   Also, when we finished our meal, we asked if they knew a good, reliable cab company that we could call, and she returned saying she would call them for us. I thought that was a nice touch.   We would return, if were even in Pittsburgh again!",

    "text": "After graduating from CMU in May, Sam and I went back to Pittsburgh for my very first \"college alum visit.\"    The original plan for our Saturday date night is one of our old time favorites Meat and Potatoes, but after spotting Hanger Tartare on Spoon's menu, we made the reservation right away.   The tartare was prepared with an amazing cut of beef and classic accompaniments: quail egg yolk, buttered brioche, fresh greens, radish and...as an exciting surprise, a side of foie gras mousse. What a solid appetizer. Our second appetizer is a bit shy on flavor but definitely creative: foie gras deviled eggs with house made pork pate and pork ravioli. Foie's richness of slightly clashed with other tangy ingredients and the ravioli filling could be more tender.  Then comes the entrees, which were basically flawless. Our choices are Hanger Steak \"Bordelaise\" and Braised Veal Short Ribs with Crispy Sweet Breads. I know they sound like rich on rich on rich, but their meat to veggie to starch ratio composed the perfect meal. I was mostly impressed by the sweet breads: extremely tender on the inside and delightfully crunchy on the outside, which balanced out their natural mushiness. Thank you our awesome charming waiter for recommending it!  Great food, great wine, great cocktails, great sweets and cheeses...it was a great night!",

More than once, I found myself having to ask the server for the basics...like menus and water. The cocktails, however, were yummy and I had several of these. From my perspecvtive, dinner was okay. I ordered the crispy skin Skuna Bay salmon (cooked medium rare), my parents each ordered the beef + veal. They enjoyed, but the portion was very small. Honestly, I love salmon, but felt like the salmon at Spoon was missing something. Flavor perhaps? We also shared a side of the butternut squash risotto - again nothing to write home about. Tasted very plain, failing to deliver any butternut squash flavor. We did not order dessert as we had dessert plans somewhere elese. Would I return? No, but give it a try. Perhaps you'll have a better experience.",

    "text": "Our party of three had been turned away two prior occasions as 'walk-ins', so needless to say, the bar was set very high when we finally had our meal there.  I made reservations two days ahead via Open Table, and was called later to re- confirm. (Ok, bar set even higher...). Our table was ready for us that Saturday night, a generously sized and comfortable corner banquette, well illuminated.  Our server was very friendly and unpretentious and able to answer questions about the menu. We had appetizers - gnocchi with cippollini and lamb ragout, Gorgonzola souffle with pear and wild greens and classic Caesar salad with anchovies.  All very good.  I was especially impressed with my gnocchi as it arrived in a deep, warmed bowl which kept my portion hot, from first bite to last drop of the flavorful broth/sauce (would it be bad form to pick up the bowl and drink the juice?!).  For entrees, we had olive- crusted lamb loin on a bed of kale with wild mushroom bread pudding, skate with couscous and tomato/citrus compote and crispy-skin wild bass with haricot verts and roasted baby potatoes. All portions were generous and beautifully presented by multiple servers who described each dish as they placed it before us.  For dessert, we shared two different dishes:  Spoon chocolate ganache cake, a chewy browny-like base, topped with cheesecake-like layer and finished with chocolate mouse topping and Baklava, with a small chocolate pots de creme and mascarpone mousse - both exquisite, satisfying and just enough. The only misstep - not hot enough French press coffee. We felt welcomed, well taken care of and well fed. As far as 'passing the bar', Spoon cleared it with miles to spare!  This trio will be back!! It's at the top of our list for dinner destinations here in Pittsburgh!!",

I was encouraged by their extensive selection of wine and spirits but I thought the prices were a bit high. The bread selection was good but definitely short of spectacular. My appetizer was the grilled prawns which were good but there were only two of them and I would have preferred more bok choy in lieu of the okonomyaki which I was disappointed in. I also liked the beef and veal entree I ordered but I would have preferred the sweetbreads to have been grilled as frying them masked their flavor and there should have been twice as many short ribs as they were quite tiny. My wife and I split the bread pudding dessert which was fabulous but I was not fond of the cinnamon ice cream as I found it slightly bitter. To sum up I think they are trying too hard and I would prefer them to keep their dishes simpler and less expensive.",

Besides the lack of attention from our server, we were both so disappointed with our entrees -- the black cod was so salty and overpowered by the other flavors that it was literally impossible to eat the entire dish. The crispy sea bass was anything but, as it was laying in a pile of broth which made it soggy and chewy (among the pile of tartar sauce (who puts tartar on sea bass!?!) that was laying on top).   Overall the plate was way too busy and overcrowded The dishes also had so much going on the plate that the flavors didn't melt together at all, everything besides the kitchen sink was put on the plate. The saddest part was that our server never came over (in fact we barely saw him the rest of the evening after he took our order) to even ask how it was!  We were so turned off we asked for the check and opted to head out somewhere else for desert.",

I love the way Spoon reinvents the familiar and also makes what is new, approachable. The food has been consistently impeccable.   Whenever I have mentioned that one or more in our party has celiac, the server has either let us know that they too have a family member with the same concerns, or reassured us that the chef will adapt whatever can be adapted so that we can explore the menu beyond what is evidently gluten free. Either way we know that the staff takes our health concerns seriously, and we are free to relax and enjoy fine dining out.   Perhaps the only thing better than the service at Spoon is the cocktails - but it's Spoon's people who make those, too.",

I split it and they even cut it and put out on two plates with a little of the side salad on each one. It was the perfect portion size since it was so rich. As an entree, I got the dish with steak (perfectly cooked to medium rare with fresh, crisply cooked vegetables) and the short rib with duck fat mashed potatoes. The short rib was amazing, incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned. The duck fat mashed potatoes were divine. Service was attentive but not overbearing, which was good. I can't speak for the rest of the entrees at the table, as I didn't taste them, but everyone enjoyed their meals. The design inside is nice, and there are several seating areas, including an outside patio and a room that can be partitioned off with a curtain. Bathrooms were clean and nice as well.

    "text": "Spoon just opened in Shadyside in mid-July. I didn't know anything about it, until I heard some rave reviews on Twitter. Since I was going to be in the neighborhood anyway, I made a reservation for Friday night. The restaurant is tastefully decorated with dark, rich colors. The air conditioning was obviously working because it was nice and cool, even though the outside temp was a sweltering 94 degrees. It was fairly busy, but the noise level was fantastic...a nice hum in the background, but I could easily hear my husband over the table. I think the curtains help absorb a lot of the noise. The service was prompt and attentive through dinner service -- at one point, the hostess came over to take our order. The waiter was swamped with other tables, but he still made sure that our orders got put into the kitchen, so we weren't waiting and starving. Nicely done.  Their wine and cocktail menu is put together well. I will note that the font is micro-sized, and it doesn't work for such a darkly lit restaurant. The table next to us mentioned it to the hostess, after they squinted and fought to read it.  The hostess said the restaurant has increased the font two times, since hearing complaints. I can't imagine what the original Liliputian print must've looked like, but they should increase it even more. Nobody wants to hold the menu at arm's length to get a glimpse of the cocktail list. And you'll want to look at the cocktail menu...it's very creative and fresh. (Although I couldn't understand why they'd offer a hot tea cocktail in the middle of July. No thank you.) The waiter suggested the basil vodka gimlet...served with simple syrup and lime, it was delicious.  Ok, so the food...very good. Creative, flavorful and fresh modern American cuisine. For appetizers, we had the 'bacon and eggs' and the ahi tuna prepared two ways. Both were great, but the bacon and eggs was a knockout -- pork belly confit with a 5 minute poached eggs on top. Underneath it all with a nice hollaindaise and on the side was cooked asparagus. Everything was done well -- the pork was rich and flavorful, and the egg was cooked just enough that the yolk was very barely cooked, and its liquid poured over the pork belly and mixed with the hollandaise. Even the asparagus was prepared well -- not overlooked at all. The ahi tuna was prepared as a roll, stuffed with crab and fresh spices over avocado puree. It was also prepared as over noodles with chili aioli.  For dinner, I had bacon wrapped day boat scallops with rock shrimp and sweet corn sautee. My husband had milk fed veal, again prepared two ways. First as a meatloaf with a spicy, sweet chipotle glaze and then braised with cabbage. Dessert was fresh fig sorbet...all their ice creams and sorbets are made in house. Solid.  They use a lot of foams and complicated little components that all work together to create a great dish. It's a lot of good stuff  that I couldn't make at home, so in my opinion that makes it worth it. They had some lower priced options on the menu which is good. I saw a burger and fries on there for $9...very reasonable for this type of restaurant. I particularly liked the 'prepared two ways' theme of some of the menu items. You basically get a taste of two dishes for the price of one entree. I know they did for 'artistic' reasons, but as a diner I really liked the economy of it.   On the way out, we stopped at their bar in the back -- very hip, though we didn't stay for a drink. It also had a burger bar...this would be a great hangout for happy hour or a casual dinner.  Bottom line - it's a winner.",

We were more than satisfied with the menu although our appetizer could've been a bit more (3 small but delicious pieces of bread).

On the menu was heirloom tomato soup, blue cheese souffle, smoked pork shank, Alaskan halibut and fig and the spoon bar for dessert. Where do I begin?? The star of the show for me was the Alaskan halibut which was flavorful, yet light. It had peppers that gave the dish a tiny kick and the fish was cooked perfectly. Both the desserts were incredible. What am I saying? Everything was incredible!!",

    "text": "Like many think of their loved ones, I think of the love I have for the biscuits I had here.  The True love I experienced is like none other.  Do you love that I've started with the bread options here??   So seriously, this buttermilk biscuit is just beyond! It's made with chives and has little cream cheese surprise inside.  Served warm. Are you dying just by the description?!  Anything with cream cheese in it is divine if you ask me....I shoved in four.  No lie.  I had heard a lot of hype about this restaurant.  It's funny because when you think of American food, what do you think of?  I think burgers and fries.  But make a food presentation fancy looking and you've got a fancy restaurant.    We tried the swordfish appetizers, which came out split between two plates.  I actually liked that because I can get greedy with my appetizer and not share, so it made things equal!  The app was good, but it wasn't amazing.  My scale goes from gross, ok, good and amazing.  This place was definitely not gross or just ok.     My main dish was very good.  I got the day boat scallops + pork two ways.  The scallops were nice and crispy, just the way I like them.  I was not thrilled with the risotto.  Granted, there was no False advertisement that it  was pearl barley and not a creamy based risotto I usually enjoy.  It just didn't have any taste, it was just....there.   The pork belly, which was described as the part of the pig that bacon comes from, was amazing!  I mean, bacon, hello!!  The homemade sausage was also really good.  The cabbage underneath both meat options was very very tasty.  I was much more into that than the risotto.   Remember that you MUST have a reservation!  It's very tiny inside, so I'd doubt you'd be able to walk in and get sat within 2 hours.  The place itself is very cool.  It was very cozy inside and had a nice intimate feel.  Great for a first date or romantical dinner out.  The service was definitely 5 star.  Our service was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when selecting the food options.  For how hip it felt inside I was surprised to see an over 60 plus crowd on a Saturday night.  But maybe I just went too early for all the cool kids.   So did this place live up the the hype?  Not necessarily.  But would I come back?  Definitely.  I'd be interested to try some of the other unique food options they have on the menu.  Maybe in a few months I can rate this as amazing!  I'm fearless and I like food, so who am I kidding, I'll be back!!",

I had the halibut, which was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. Perfectly cooked. I think how spoon really stands out is by the incredible service. The server really paid attention to food allergies and warned us in the event we wanted to share. Drinks were topped off every few minutes. Super nice host staff.

Although it is in a pretty building in an up-and-coming area, it does not wow with its decor. The staff were attentive. The appetizers were tasty, not amazing. We picked a scallop app and a butternut squash soup. Both were decently well cooked with nothing notable. I have had similarly tasty soups at Panera. The duck entree we shared was a bit overcooked to medium, not rare as we'd requested. Nothing was terrible, everything was enjoyable and tasty, but the food lacked the finesse that I'd expect at this price range. Sadly, I think I could have cooked a better birthday dinner at home, probably for half of the price. I'm not opposed to returning with a Groupon were it ever offered, but I won't be back at full price.",

    "text": "I do not get what everyone is talking about; I am guessing all of these reviews are from young hipsters or pretentious middle age drones looking for some cool in their life. Let me start by saying that I enjoy what I call \"casual elegance.\" I like good upscale food, in a modern, casual atmosphere, with a laid back nice, but down to earth vibe. Somewhere like SIX PENN Kitchen or something. I decided to come here after reading many great reviews on Yelp. This place is comical, trys wayy to hard!  It is very small, tables very close. Low ceiling/dark paint so it feels very claustrophobic. It does describe itself as a lounge so I will give them that; if you like swanky lounge vibe this place is actually pretty nice. Too dark and small for my liking. The waiter, dressed in his skinny jeans and pompadour brought over a bottle of tap water to pour. We politely decline b/c I didn't want water so why waste it..ya know. He seemed offended that I didn't want water, he offered us wine, and we declined, I just wanted a diet coke because I was on call for work and could not drink. He became aloof, almost took it as a personal assault that we didn't want wine!  I ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, \"Oh you want to share the appetizer\" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn't specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information.   So we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had \"seared\" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I'd give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better.   I think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance.   Pass. There are plenty of good places in the Burgh that have excellent food, but are comfortable and laid back, but still elegant.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have eaten dinner at Spoon twice now.  We did not enjoy our first dining experience there this past summer...it was expensive, the portions were small, and we did not find out entrees particularly tasty. However, after receiving a gift card to Spoon over the holidays and checking out some of the new, seasonal menu items, we decided to give it another shot.  This time around, we found our experience much more enjoyable.  I started off with a glass of the red sangria, while my boyfriend went with a scotch on the rocks.  My sangria was perfectly sweet and served with a single slice of blood orange.  While sipping our drinks, we dug into the delicious bread basket: biscuits, cornbread, and baguette slices, served warm and with honey butter. Definitely a highlight.  We decided to skip the appetizers and just order entrees.  I went with the vegetarian tasting, which consisted of \"housemade tamale, refried lentils, roasted pepper ragout, tomatillo salsa, and tortilla soup.\"  The soup was probably my favorite part of this dish.  It was smoky, creamy, and garnished with tortilla chips and a bit of broccoli.  The rest of the dish was light and tasty.  Spoon doesn't have many vegetarian options, but I would recommend this entree to any vegetarians who are considering dining here.  Finally, we ended the meal with a scoop of bacon ice-cream.  Yes, bacon.  Not something I would normally choose, but my boyfriend was intrigued.  The ice-cream had a sweet maple flavor, to which the bacon pieces added some saltiness and smokiness.  We had a hard time deciding if we enjoyed it or not.  Definitely an interesting flavor combination.  Overall, I would say that we enjoyed our most recent experience at Spoon much more than our first visit.  The entrees here seem to be a bit of a hit-or-miss.  I will say that our service was very pleasant, and the bar/lounge area in front of the fireplace seem like a nice place to relax and enjoy a drink.  If you're looking for other restaurants in the area comparable to Spoon, I would recommend also taking a look at Avenue B, Casbah, Legume, and Dinette.",

    "text": "This is hands-down, one of the best dining experiences and food I've ever had. Local food restaurant = bonus.  Atmosphere is intimate and romantic. Dimly lit yet bustling and lively. Even the bathroom looks nice. Service is the best I have experienced in awhile - there are always so many eyes looking at your table - whether it be to refill your water, folding the napkin when someone leaves for the bathroom, making sure you have a bread basket, or just the manager in general making sure everything's okay.   Food is on another level. The bread basket with honey-whipped-butter, as highly raved by other Yelpers, does indeed live up to the hype - particularly the cream cheese with chive scone. Divine.   The appetizer to order is the gorgonzola blue cheese souffle. If you are a blue cheese fan, this is a MUST get. The blue cheese flavor is a nice punch accompanied by a sweet-sour apple salad to cut the overwhelming creaminess of the souffle.  BBQ chicken appetizer was tasty but was on some bed of overly salty green veg I was not a fan of. Baby octopus was okay.  The star entree were the seared scallops, which were seasoned well and cooked to perfection (although it only came in 3 pieces). I got the vegetarian tasting, which has every vegetable tasting as fresh as being plucked out of someone's garden and came in a variety of textures - enough to satisfy any vegetarian or non-vegetarian alike.   Lastly, we could not resist dessert. The favorite was the homemade sorbet in kiwi flavor - tastes essentially like a cold kiwi puree! I got the cheese platter that had a variety of local cheeses - the flavor was so strong it was like a punch in the face - recommend for any cheese lover if they have any stomach space leftover! Unfortunately, the apple ice cream with churros were not well received (the ice cream was tasty though).  This is a solid 5-star rating for a great night out with a date or to impress a party of people. It is more 'gourmet'-like but I found the portions filling enough and price reasonable for what you get. The $3 valet parking offered beside the restaurant provides added convenience as well.",

She was a native Pittsburgher who had recently returned after being out of the area for a few years I wanted to try new, up-and-coming restaurant. And while I don't think that Spoon is new in the sense of age or time at the location. It did offer a new experience especially for the neighborhood.  During our visit the staff was friendly and Knowledgeable. They consistently offered up suggestions, potential pairings specials and Chef's recommendations. Proteins are well prepared and I have to say some of the best breads I've had in a long time. From appetizers, to entrees, desserts and wines the experience was great.   The one thing that is preventing me from giving the restaurant five stars is the physical layout of the restaurant itself. It struggles between having an open flowing layout and wanting to be a quiet and cozy dining area. Adjusting the lighting and potentially addressing seating placement so individuals are not seated under spotlights while they're dining guest is in the dark would be a great touch. If you has to be seated with that in mind I'm sure that you'll have a great experience at Spoon.",

I'd been here for drinks a couple of times before and had always enjoyed their specialty cocktails but I had never eaten anything.   I definitely recommend going with a specialty cocktail.

I also had the Spoon Bar for dessert, which was delicious, though it's hard to disappoint me when there's chocolate involved. I forget the name of the cocktail I had (oops) but I've never been failed by a cocktail there.   Minus one star for the try-hard atmosphere. It's almost uncomfortable.

The good: I really enjoyed (half) of my pork tenderloin meal which was mostly due to the pulled pork creeps that were the perfect mix of sweet and savory. My wife seemed to enjoy her scallops with risotto although the risotto was too fishy for my taste. And of course, the bread basket was to die for.  The bad: our waiter was far from welcoming and seemed genuinely upset we hadn't decided on drinks after 5 minutes (and stopping over 3 times). Just seemed to want to get us in and out too quickly.  We ordered the tomato tasting as an appetizer and were incredibly underwhelmed by most of the plate. Mushy salty marinade with a side of tomato jelly and tomato water that just didn't hit the palette well.  As for the coffee after dinner, I understand it was probably French press, but it had more coffee grounds than we could bare.  I would probably go back again based on everyone's recommendations, but this was a far from perfect experience for the price.",

    "text": "Excellent night out at Spoon this past weekend. We were in town visiting friends and decided to give this place a shot. The ambience here is quite nice - many nooks and crannies with dim lighting providing a very cozy and private dining experience. The table service was top notch throughout our stay. Waitress was always prompt, and our glasses never went unfilled. We started with fantastic bubbly from the wine menu. The wine menu here is quite expansive with a variety of region's represented. In the bubbly section alone, France, US, Austria, Spain and others were all represented. Given the size of the restaurant, I was surprised by the extensive wine list. The wine was served nicely chilled with Schott wine glasses. The glassware was top notch throughout our stay. I did speak with the Sommelier who was helpful in making some suggestions, but fairly unsociable. I have found the best Sommeliers really tell a story about a wine - about either the flavors or the region. The Somm here was able to say this is good, that is a little sweet, this is a good value, etc. No real back story on the wines.   Our table decided to do the Chef's Table. The first course was a steak tartare topped with arugula, shredded radishes, and raw egg. The flavors here were excellent, and if I were more a fan of steak tartare I would have loved this. The arugula provided a nice spice to the steak and egg. After polishing off the bottle of bubbly, our table transitioned to an excellent bottle of Scherrer Syrah (2009, \"Sasha\"). The Somm was kind enough to decant for us, and this wine was really a showstopper (that is another review in itself). Next up was scallops served over white beans and creme fraiche. The scallops were perfectly done, but browned on only one side. The beans and creme fraiche were very rich and complemented the light flavors of the scallops well. We next moved on to the leg of lamb served with kale and pomegranate seeds. This was a beautiful presentation. The lamb was cooked well, certainly slow cooked as it was very tender. The flavor was a bit on the gamey side for me. The accompanying polenta and turnips were terrific. The polenta was probably the most remarkable of all the dishes we had that night. Lastly, we had a terrific creme brulee that was executed very well. Overall, the Chef's Table was interesting, but I would not order it again. I felt it was too heavy in proteins and really lacked contrast - I cannot recall a single component of acid.   We had a terrific time at Spoon. We had excellent service. The wine menu is top tier and the wine service is very good as well. The menu is very interesting with diverse offerings. Will be back here again.",

    "text": "This has become a favorite with my in-laws when they come through town. My mother-in-law has a sulfate allergy (basically wine or anything fermented), and Spoon goes above and beyond in terms of helping to navigate the menu. Without even asking, our server comes prepared with tweaks from the chef should she be interested in any dishes that might otherwise be off-limits.  As others have mentioned, the bread basket is killer. They usually have some sort of flavored butter, and a variety of breads. I think I'd be happy to eat an entire basket of the cream cheese and chive biscuits for my dinner! The last time we went we tried their cheese plate. It had a great variety of cheeses, as well as great pairings like fresh fruit preserves (made in-house if I remember correctly.) I was a little disappointed by their basic salad. It comes with a champagne vinaigrette, which tasted weirdly salty to me- not sharp or acidic, just salty.   Both times I've gone, I've gotten a fish entree. The first time I got a salmon dish that wasn't too memorable.  Based on that first entree- perfectly good, but not incredible- I wasn't too quick to come back to Spoon, left to my own devices.  But I'm glad I did come back, because I got some sort of monkfish (or was it sea bass?) in a coconut curry with black beans, farro and even a few pieces of shrimp. It was incredible- the silky broth, with the slight chew from the farro and the buttery fish. Mmm! I even saved a bit for a nice lunch the next day.   I've usually been too full to get a really over-the-top dessert, but I've really enjoyed their homemade soberts.",

    "text": "Loveeed it. Came here with my dad about two weeks ago and we both had a spectacular meal.  Firstly the bread was amazingly delicious- it came in a basket with butter which wasn't too salty. There was a biscuit, foccacia and something else- I forget. I wish the server actually explained to us our bread selection. Regardless, we asked for a second basket after finishing the first.  For appetizers, I ordered a spring mixed salad and my father ordered Nantucket clam risotto. Both were incredible. My salad had various greens and sprouts with different textures from the different vegetables. My fathers risotto was the best risotto I have ever had!   For our entree I had the salmon with bacon wrapped around it and my father had the lamb. He wasn't as ecstatic about his meal as I was with my salmon. It was soooo good! There was a sweet potato puree adorned on the sides for I suppose aesthetic purposes. The salmon came in four pieces in a size slightly larger than a goofball. They were wrapped in a maybe maple glazed bacon. It was so flavorful every bite was mouth watering.  The quality and presentation of the good is incredible and worth the price. I will most definitely go there again!",

This time I came for restaurant week: * Blue cheese souffle: 10/10 one of my favorite things in Pittsburgh. It's light, creamy and comforting and it comes with a tasty beets and mixed green salad tossed in a light vinaigrette. * Hangar steak: 4/10 would never get this again. The meat looked to be perfectly medium rare, but it was cold and dry and shriveled up when I ate it - as if it had been sitting out for a while. * Spoon bar: 8/10 great dessert - I love chocolate mouse and there were nice crunchy bits on top and the cookie bottom also kept things textually interesting.",

I made the reservation a month ago so why did the waitress try to sit us back in a corner near the exit door with windows looking out onto Highland and Centre Ave???  I asked for another table and we were seated nearby but still looking out onto the unpleasant street scene.  The restaurant had a lovely dining area the other side of the bar and also empty tables in front of the fireplace.  I have found in Pittsburgh that when you reserve a time you also have to reserve the table and the area that you want.     The food.  Spoon get great reviews but it's not worth  more than a 3.  The bread basket was good but the not best we have ever had.  One person ordered the rice polenta and it was a small white mound surrounded by mushrooms.  He said that it was bland and not satisfying..  The other ordered the hamburger and wanted it pink and juicy.  She got overdone and dry.  The french fries were good though.  Husband ordered the pork loin on a bed of rice and said that it was just ok.  I ordered the bucatini lobster dish and it was a bit tasteless although the pasta was nicely al dente and there was decent chunks of lobster in it.    Not a good dining experience.  Try AvenueB which is nearby.  Or Casbah always great!",

The gnocchi was good but not exceptional.  Scallops was good but the beans were undercook underneath.  Overall the food was just average.  There are other places much better in Pittsburgh.",

The young woman we had was personable, knew her menu and had terrific ideas. I had the octopus appetizer. Completely unexpected experience and unlike any octopus I've ever had. The only downside is that I'll always be comparing other octopus dishes with yours and they'll all come off as inferior. I had the tuna, etc. served as a bowl dish with a raw egg on top. Also, unlike anything I've had before and great. My wife had the lobster appetizer who loved it. Funny thing is that she normally doesn't like lobster. She had the hamburger which was fun and good.   All in all it was an incredible experience.  BTW, what surprised me was the fact that it was Sunday and slow when the Chef often takes a day off and the food suffers slightly. Not last night!!!  Thanks again. We'll be back.",

Service was outstanding from our waiter, to the other servers that assisted, to John the Sommelier.  John spent a little time with us with several recommendations that would go with our mix of dinner orders.  He actually highly recommended a bottle that was one of the least expensive on the wine list.  He got it right, too, very nice cabaret franc. The bread basket was very good, probably could have eaten bread all night. Interesting menu with many fresh items.  We shared a grilled avocado that came with a charred tomato vinaigrette, oven roasted tomato and some creamy burrito.  We also had the bleu cheese souffle that had french peaches, nectarines, plums and a nice arugula with a sweet and sharp vinaigrette. I had a pork and shrimp dinner that was very good, the pork was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was good but maybe a tad over cooked but still tasty and good. All of the meals had some interesting ingredients that introduced some very tasty meals.  The preparation and presentation was top notch.",

I've been wanting to go for ages and it sounded like I would love it so much I wanted to marry it, but yeah ... it was more of just a one-date thing, I think.  I went last Saturday when I was in town & staying in Shadyside. The dining room was lovely, albeit a bit stiff, but lovely. The waitstaff was also lovely, albeit a bit stiff. So ... it was nice.  We got a basket of freshly baked breads and such, in which were tucked these crazy amazing dill and cream cheese biscuits that were, clearly, sent from Heaven (I could've eaten about 73 of them). A good start.  We ordered starters--we'd asked the waiter for his picks and he recommended the Peking Duck with scallion pancakes and apple slaw, so we got that and the grilled avocado, which sounded ding-danged amazing. The avocado, super-simple with roasted tomato and a blob of burrata, was delicious; the duck, well, it was fine. Good, but not GREAT (I wanted it to be great).  At the table, we ordered Veal Shortrib Cassoulet, Pork Scallopini on Pumpkin Risotto, and the Spoon Burger. All was good. Quite good. But again, I wasn't blown away and no one's eyes rolled back into their heads, which I was kinda hoping for.  Dessert--which WAS amazing--was this apple creation with butternut squash custard, cinnamon arlette, 5 spice apple goodness, and apple butter. THAT was decadent and ridiculous and I want 6 more.  But yeah. It was good. Quite good. But there are so many amazing places in PGH, that I don't know that \"good\" is enough to bring me back.",

    "text": "Another update from the D's...  Another great night at Spoon. Seriously, this place is a win every time for when we want to have a solid \"grown-ups night out\" for the two of us.  This time, we didn't want to delve into a full tasting menu and ordered a-la-carte, starting with two delicious drinks from the bar. I had their version of a delicious Old Fashioned (with Cointreau and Bulleit rye) and my wife had a delicious gin-based beverage. Kudos to the mixologists - these were oh, so smooth and tasty. The best part was that their skills with the shakers made the drinks taste delicious, without the traditional alcohol \"bomb\" that straight up mixed drinks can often have.  I had the lobster and beef tartare as a starter, and opted for their lamb two ways, a great choice. I typically order fish, pork or other non red-meat sorts of things when I go out, just to see what the Chef has up his or her sleeve, but tonight, I felt like lamb - it was definitely the good move... Delicious, non-gamy, and buttery smooth.  My wife had the gorgonzola souffle/salad, which is always a favorite of ours. I am happy that they keep that item on the menu all the time; I would miss it if it disappeared. She then had the halibut, which was perfectly sauteed with beurre blanc, just like Julia Child would have approved of.  I couldn't say no to the Spoon Bar for dessert, and we shared that delicious treat to round out the night.  The atmosphere at Spoon is awesome, with enjoyable subtle tunes that don't overpower conversation, and lighting/furniture that lets you relax and enjoy the moment. Our server was helpful but not imposing; he let us enjoy our meal greatly while also attending to our every need; including a second bread service to devour!  In case you were in doubt after reading this review... we will definitely be back!",

The 1st course was a pot roast served on noddles and it was cold as well. The cheese board, wine, and bread were great! In addition the spoon bar for dessert was just okay. The topping chocolate part just tasted like a fudge Popsicle. Overall none of the dishes really stood out. I was surprised because most places for restaurant week go all out .",

Our waiter promptly greeted us and explained the menu while we made the difficult decision of what to order.    After perusing, we selected an appetizer of smoked scallops with foie gras pate, country bread, asparagus, truffle vinaigrette.  What a beautiful presentation!  Before this night, I never had foie gras - so rich!  Combined with the sweetness of the scallop and crispness of the green, this dish tantalized my taste buds.   For my entree, I chose roasted game hen with spring risotto, English peas,fava beans, haricot verts, lemon + tarragon reduction.  I could eat this risotto everyday!  The creaminess combined with the perfectly seasoned game hen, topped with the lemon and tarragon reduction - I was incredibly pleased.    Finally, to close out our perfect evening I felt the need for something light but sweet.  Tres Leches was the ideal selection.  For this - I truly have no words!  It was probably my favorite dessert thus far.  It hit every note - sweet, savory, cool, warm, tart,,, I left with a smile.  Spoon was delicious, beginning to end.

However, they told us three times at the door that we needed a reservation and that \"apparently everyone had arrived to eat at the same time...\"  Yet I looked around and saw gray haired folks sitting at maybe 8 or so of the ~20 tables.  Uh, okay - I get that you're trying to convey trendiness, but it's a Wednesday night, there's no one here, and I just got asked for money by random street folks two times while walking to the door.    The food was pretty good - not much of it and nothing to write home about.  My scallops and crab cake were tasty and properly cooked.  However, for the price and atmosphere, I'd love to have something in Pittsburgh more like Lola in Cleveland or other five stars with serious soul and love in the food.  For example, at Lola recently, we got recommendations for apps, wine, and desserts that would taste yummy with our food.  But none of the five different people who came to our table ever chatted with us about  other things we could eat, what we were eating, etc.  I did get a few pieces of info about the wine from the waiter, but he didn't seem particularly excited about us eating there (we were the only ones in the room under 40, and most patrons looked like sleepy rich old folks).  Can't put my finger on it, but I just can't see myself raving about this restaurant to others.  I wouldn't strongly recommend it to my friends unless they or I have a client, new hire, or out-of-town visitor that really needs to be impressed.  That being said, make sure to valet if you want to impress - we were asked for money as soon as we exited the door and walked to our car.",

(We are in the process of moving to Pittsburgh, so new to the dining scene in the 'burgh.)  Our expectations were, sadly, not met by Spoon. Maybe it was a bad night and just bad luck for us, so I'd be willing to give it a go again in the future.  So, what wasn't up to scratch? For starters, the service was not good enough. We arrived and a group of three old ladies (i.e., easily well into their 70s--one was with a walking frame!) were trying to get out the door. They, of course, were having some trouble with the (heavy) doors and the step down to the sidewalk. Between the two valet guys and two hostesses standing around, there were four restaurant staff who did NOT help these nice ladies. My wife and I instead did the good deed of helping them outside to their waiting car. Not a good sign of the restaurant's respect for their customers. After being seated the first interaction with our server was \"Do you know what cocktail you want?\" No \"hi, welcome to Spoon\" or \"how are you tonight?\" We had just sat down so asked for more time and he just walked off. His gruffness continued, though was markedly toned down to a more acceptable human level by night's end.  The food. Other reviewers have raved about the food. I've had better elsewhere. In Pittsburgh my experience is limited, but I've had fantastic dinners at places like Salt of the Earth and Tamari. I hoped Spoon was in the same league...that remains to be seen. Compared to some decent neighborhood places in NYC, Spoon just didn't stand out. It was above-average for sure in the food department, but there were too many misses, not enough hits, and some ill-conceived dishes. Perhaps we just chose wrongly and had some bad luck. Who knows?  For appetizers, we had the enchiladas stuffed with some seafood (swordfish I think, but it was tasteless), and the shrimp and grits. The enchiladas were nothing special. The pineapple salsa was the only piece of flavor on the dish. The shrimp and grits was better, but nothing spectacular. It was a good quality southern version of mushroom risotto, with a gratuitous jumbo shrimp on top. The shrimp was overcooked and a bit rubbery. What a shame.  For entrees, we had the cod and the \"surf and turf\" (NY strip and Maryland crab cake). The cod--my wife's choice--was very good. The NY strip was done just fine, but the crab cake was dry and the only flavor came from the standard crab cake sauce on top of it. Our problem with these dishes was that they were a bit too \"busy\"--there was too much going on. For example, the NY strip and crab cake was served with a potato cake and creamed spinach and a caramelized pearl onion. The crab cake was totally unnecessary in this dish.  We skipped dessert because nothing sounded all that exciting to us.  Overall, for the two of us the total (with standard tip) was about $150 (including two glasses of wine and one cocktail). This seemed too pricey for what we got.   Overall, I think this restaurant definitely has a good team in the kitchen and they are turning out dishes with quality, local ingredients--and that's a good thing. But things were too complicated in the dishes and this detracted from the overall taste of the dishes. A general problem with the food was that the main flavors came more from sauces and garnishes than the proteins themselves. Particularly in seafood-focused dishes. That's a pity.  Will we go back? Sure, we'll try Spoon again. Is this a \"hot\" and \"must do\" restaurant in Pittsburgh? Not necessarily; certainly not in my opinion at the moment. It did seem very popular with more elderly clientele, though.",

    "text": "hit up Spoon for date night last weekend and easily had one of the best dining experiences in the 412.  first of all, i have a diesel truck.  it's big.  like really, really big.  and, this sometimes makes valet parking a gigantic pain in the ass.  not at spoon.  the kids there were actually fighting about who got to drive the beast.  extra points there.  second of all, we made the reservation ahead of time through yelp's open table option about four days beforehand.  yelp kept reminding us of the reservation every time i logged on, and then Spoon also called to confirm a few hours before our 9pm slot.  all in all, super-easy and effective.  third of all, we had one of the best waiters ever - douglas.  i liked the cut of this guy's jib from the get-go, and he proved himself to be worthy of a big tip throughout the night.  he was extremely attentive while being laidback and very knowledgeable without coming off like a snob.    fourth of all, the sangria was excellent.  normally, i like red sangria better than white.  but, the white sangria here totally hit the spot.  AND, it didn't have all of this ridiculous fruit jammed at the bottom of the glass.  we got a carafe, and it was worth it.  fifth of all, the food was amaaaazing.  believe the hype about those biscuits: they're goddamn delicious...AND, douglas offered us seconds.  for the appetizer, we had the bone marrow & pork belly based on other yelp reviews.  while they were both top notch, my former-vegetarian girl keeps asking if we can go back to spoon just so we can have the pork belly, which actually melts in your mouth.  for entrees, we had the cod and scallops & prawns -- which were both perfect.    we'll definitely be back once we make it through our date night rotation.  five stars for sure!!!",

    "text": "I really like Spoon.  I love their drinks, I like the atmosphere, I like the staff, and I enjoy the array of culinary offerings.  They first entice you with this awesome bread basket.  If a place has warm, fresh bread with fresh butter, they've already started me off on the right foot.  Let me elaborate on that...if the bread comes out stale and cold, and the butter comes out cold and like someone threw a few slabs on land o'lakes on a butter dish, I'm already mentally preparing myself for a disappointing meal.  I mean, at that point, why even serve bread?? Just seems pointless and silly to me.  Ok, enough about the bread.  Just know it's reeaaally yummy.  I first enjoyed this place with my friend Rachel.  We sat at the bar where the bartenders were quite handy and helpful in letting us know what they'd recommend in terms of drink and food.  I believe this was my first experience with a Sazerac and with a cocktail that had egg whites in it.  I know, seems kind of crazy and dangerous, but maybe it was just that much more yummy knowing I was being unruly and edgy with my egg whites drink.  It's not like Rocky-style drinking eggs, but more like a frothy foamy treat.  These mixologists know what they're doing and certainly take pride in their craft.  We shared a few appetizers and an entree..remember, sharing is caring! And really, it's the way to go with food..you get to try a little bit of everything!  I don't remember not liking anything I put in my mouth that night.  But one dish particularly stood out.  If you go to Spoon, you simply MUST order the bacon and eggs.  Pork belly, poached egg, spinach, hollandaise..pretty much the equation to a foodgasm.  It was delicate, decadent, rich, and oh....so...tasty!  The dish itself is beautifully presented and well thought out.  Reminded me of breakfast but so much better.  We had it for dessert, because I knew we had to save the best for last.  My favorite part is slowly forking the poached egg that laid gently atop the braised pork belly.  I equated it to the joy of the first break in a creme brulee crust, holding my breath a bit until the deed was done.  Not sure why I hold my breath...Watching the yolk slowly run down the plate and lightly cover everything was a delight.  It was sort of the glue that brought all the elements together into one perfect, celestial bite. mmmmmm...  I've been back here with Jhon and I was once again not disappointed.  We loved their drinks and butterfish.  All in all, I am a big fan!",

Impeccable service, they made my date a special pasta dish because she couldn't eat most of the things on the menu- huge plus for that, they offered! Creative food, reminiscent of a NY place. Prices v. reasonable (one of the reason it's awesome going out to nice places in Pittsburgh)! Really nothing but good things to say about it (should be a 4.5 but not an option), I just never give out a 5 (I believe in the bell curve distribution for ratings).",

The food not only is delicious but the presentation is also stunning.When I came here they had this carrot soup, and I've never had anything like it, it was sweet and tangy and just packed with so many different flavors and was simply the best soup I have ever had, easily. My girlfriend had a salad that was just a work of art and our main courses were also fantastic.  Yes this is one of the more expensive restaurants in pgh; but for the quality of food, the service and the ambiance, you definitely get what you pay for. If this restaurant was in DC, or NYC you would pay double for this type of food/service. If I could give it 6 stars I would!",

    "text": "I went here for a b'day dinner a few weeks ago and the food and service were impeccable!  The service may have been really good b/c of our big group and the fact that we were sitting in the outdoor patio and had 1 server address all our needs (which they did very well).  I ordered the Salmon and it was delish - I'm not a big salmon fan, but I can eat it occassionally.  I do love seafood but I would say Salmon is my least favorite, but Spoon may have changed my mind!!!  It was so good, I can't even begin to desribe it's deliciousness...ok but let me try.  It was cooked to perfection, I had to tell the server \"well-done\" for the fish b/c they ask you how you'd like it cooked...which I thought was odd for seafood.  But I told them that I like it flaky and tender and I'm only saying \"well-done\" b/c I don't want it to be raw, but I don't want it dried out either.  They totally got what I was saying and it was cooked to perfection.  I was a bit skeptical when they brought the dish out b/c it looked tiny, but it sure filled me up.  Under the fish there were some green beans and some gnocchi.  Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!    For a drink I got the Basil Gimlet - delish!    Sure, when the check came it was a bit pricey, but every once in a while shouldn't you treat yourself to a great meal.  If you're looking for a treat, check out Spoon!",

They had perfect lighting for Instagram pictures!  We ordered off of the Valentine's Day menu, which was a three-course dinner.  Appetizer, main entree, and dessert.  For the appetizer I enjoyed the celery root soup, and my partner had the cured trout and caviar.  The soup was phenomenal.  Creamy, but not heavy.  The trout and caviar was delicious, also!  For the main dish, I ordered the duo of beef.  I haven't tried beef cheek before, so I was really looking forward to that.  The ribeye and beef cheek were outstanding!  Melt in your mouth, tender!  My partner ordered the Alaskan black cod with crab cakes.  He absolutely loved it! The cod was outstanding and he raved about the crab cakes.  For dessert, we got the spoon bar and carrot.  If you love chocolate, you will love the spoon bar.  The carrot was amazing as well and I am not a huge fan of carrot cake.  The presentation for all of the dishes was beautiful!  The staff was very friendly too! I would 100% return to try the main menu!",
