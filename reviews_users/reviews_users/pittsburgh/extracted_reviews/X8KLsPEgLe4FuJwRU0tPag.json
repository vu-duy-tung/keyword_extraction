The new owner stopped by our table ( I knew him from the time when he was a manager / cook..) and said that they had a grand opening last night. He welcomes us with small Cosmo drinks. Then he brought the whole plate of the  appetizers. We had great dinner ( lamb, chicken,salad). Everything you order is great quality. Place is unbelievably clean.  Every  surface is shinny( it was always like that and it's very refreshing to see)  Thank you for great time",

Second trip I brought my husband, we started with the Mazza Platter.  Really great way to start!  Then I had Spinach Pie and my husband had the Filet.  Very, very good. Our food was packed with flavor.  Service was excellent, very friendly staff, nice atmosphere.  Sangria is the best I've tasted in a long time!",

    "text": "Love this place. Living in Cecil I feel lucky to have this place within 5 minutes of my home. In a suburb filled with wing joints, burger joints and chains it's a breath of fresh air. The atmosphere is quaint but comfortable and the wait staff is very friendly. Mazza Platter is a no-brainer for us as the Baba Ghannouj and Hummus are out of this world. I usually alternate between the filet and lamb and they're always spot on, cooked as ordered, and seasoned perfectly. My wife is stuck on the Moussaka and pretty much refuses to order anything else so that's a resounding endorsement from a picky eater. I don't make it in too often for breakfast but when we have an opportunity, their classics are tasty and good along with a few twists.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined here for the first time on 29 October 2013.  The restaurant is spacious and there are two rooms in which one may dine. The soundproofing is apparent excellent; one does not hear the Washington Avenue traffic that is a constant presence within twenty feet of the dining room. This is a congested area, but a complimentary parking lot is offered for customers in the rear of the building.  Although there was only one party there when we arrived and many four-tables available in both rooms, we were placed near the party at a tiny table for two.  We were not asked where we wanted to sit or whether the table at which we were seated was acceptable to us. Halfway through our meal, the staff decided to seat a party of six, which included young children, two feet from us, the end of any chance for intimate conversation. The highlight of our meal was the outstanding service from Franny.  She was unfailingly gracious, attentive, and efficient, never without a broad smile.  There is a whopping $10 corking fee for those foolish enough to bring their own wine, the message apparently being, \"Do not do it.\" I found it odd that the restaurant did not have any Heineken bottled beer, which is on the menu.  A Lebanese beer substitute ($4.50 per bottle) was not an adequate substitute and did not have much flavor.  My wife's dirty martini was $9, quite pricey for the size of it.  The website mentions a \"juicy burger\", but there is nothing like it on the fairly small menu.  Our falafel appetizer with yogurt dipping sauce was tasty and an ample portion, but the balls somewhat dry.  The bread that was served with the appetizer was dry, shriveled, and tasteless. My gyro salad entree with french fries was good, though the meat not juicy.  The salad, like the salad which accompanies entrees, was predominantly iceberg lettuce, but there was enough meat and fries in my dish to satisfy, and it was fairly priced at $10.95. My wife enjoyed her moussaka.  If a customer has any comments about Shouf's, whether positive or constructive criticism, regarding Shouf's, you would best be advised not not to waste your time in submitting them.  The owners are not interested.  You can expect to be ignored.  I will take my business where it is valued.",

    "text": "I decided to try Shouf's and purchased a Groupon deal. My husband and I stoped by for dinner a few weekends ago. This small restaurant/coffee shop has a few tables by the bar and a few more in an ajoining room. It has a casual, homey feel. The wait staff were nice but became distracted when someone they knew came in to talk and eat. I ordered the filet while my husband ordered the chicken shish tawook. Both entrees came with a salad with their homemade dressing. I was a little disappointed with the salad because it was made with pale looking iceberg with a tomato wedge and an olive. The salad also comes with feta but I opted out. Their homemade dressing is quite tangy and not for you if you prefer bland flavors. (I loved it though my husband ws not a fan) Our dinners were served with their pita bread.The filet was presented in cubes over rice pilaf with a large stewed tomato in the middle. The filet was average. It was cooked as ordered and was tender but I was looking for more Lebanese flavoring, or any flavoring for that matter. The rice pilaf was also rather bland. On the other hand, my husband's chicken was juicy and delicious. I ended up sharing most of his meal. I gave Shouf's 3 stars because I didn't feel like they were consistent. Some items were delicious while others lacked flavor. I also thought it was a bit pricey for what you get. Tweny dollars for about 4-5 ounces of filet over rice with an iceberg lettece salad seems a little high. With some minor changes, Shouf's could easily make the impovements needed o bring customers (like me) back in the door.",

My favorite meal there is the pork shank, but since the wife and I have been on a \"4-Hour Body\", slow carb diet, we steered away from anything with grains (the pork shank comes over rice).  This lead me to get the Gyro salad and Kelly to get her favorite, chicken salad. She actually loves that chicken salad so much that when she was pregnant I use to go pick it up and bring it home multiple times per week!  They gyro salad was awesome too. This is the first I've had it, and normally I would expect a gryo salad to be made with thin sliced meat (like a gyro). At Shouf's, the meat is thicker, and cooked perfectly. It's a bit crisp on the outside and cooker perfectly through the center.   We're looking forward to getting back soon!",

We took a seat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the staff, who were clearly Lebanese and some of the friendliest food & bev people I have come in contact with in a while. The babaganoush was fresh and very authentic and the baklava, let's just say I haven't had baklava that delicious since I was in Turkey. Our server was enthusiastic about the restaurant and really seemed to love their job and the employees. Can't wait to go back to see the belly dancing show on Friday nights!",

It was served kind of like a meatloaf instead of in the acorn shape and was really good. Also devoured was their excellent falafel as an app and a slice of their \"death by chocolate\" cake wich was decadent. There was so much food, I took half of it home, the kibbee really holding up well the next day for lunch. Our server Cathy was a hoot. Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune were one, and she played along with us, talking about old game shows and stuff. Cool restaurant.",

We ordered the mazza platter and the hummus, baba ghannouj and tabbouli were fantastic.  I'm a huge fan of baba ghannouj and was a bit surprised to see how smooth theirs was, the baba that I've had has always been a bit chunky.  But chunky or not, it was delicious.  The hummus was also seasoned perfectly. I often get disappointed by the lack of flavor in hummus when I'm at restaurants but you could taste the lemon and the freshness of the chick peas.    I got the grape leaves as my main dish and they were heavenly.  Steamed hot just like I like them and flavorful.  My husband got the lamb kabob and meat pie and devoured them both!  I tried a piece of the lamb and although I'm not much of a lamb fan, I will admit this was gooood!  I wasn't a big fan of the meat pie after having a bite, but like I said the husband loved it.    Also ordered a piece of their baklava and it was perfect.  I'm not a huge fan of overly sugar/honey soaked baklava and this was crispy on top with a healthy amount of nut filling with the sugar soaked on the bottom portion of the pastry dough - YUM!    I'll definitely be back again!",

    "text": "\"This is somethin' outta 'The Flintstones,'\" our affable server Cathy told me as she trotted out Shouf's Lamb Shank, a brontosaurus leg of a protein serving slathered with a gravy of a reddish-orange hue and hunks of cauterized tomato on a bed of rice.   Stripping the meat from the white bone required no exertion, and chewing it was almost unnecessary due to its fall-apart composition. The lamb itself was suety, slippery, and when coated with the tart, luscious sauce, approached a lamb curry, especially with the addition of cinnamon which made it close to mystical, mythical. I felt like the knight who had slain a dragon and was partaking in a grand, celebratory feast as a reward.   An appetizer of falafel began the proceedings. The small bronze planets orbited a cup of a milky/silky tahini sauce that recalled tzatziki flatteringly, the Arabic hush puppies of chickpea plucking chords of crispness and moisture.   Shouf's signature Lebanese Salad came between starter and entrees and was comprised of freshly shredded feta that resembled fallen snow which topped iceberg lettuce (how appropriate), cucumber, tomato, olives, and a lemony house dressing. Despite the acidic ingredients, it was never overly tart and served to wash my palate clean for what was to come.   Dessert was an onyx monolithic cut of chocolate cake. Blacker than a starless night, chocolate shavings laid about its exterior like shingles. It was served cold like revenge often is, its darkness recalling deep space, where no cries for mercy can be detected...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6hFCZtdOExo&s=4c501f1d52684c46d5436199a9127dd64d337e84057f91734522744059c488a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=6hFC...</a>  The baked batter was sodden with liquid chocolate, ganache mortaring this hellhouse on a plate. Only holy water could expel the evil spirits from my throat before the depravity choked me to death.   And before we realized dinner was over, it was. Kay had her meal doggy-bagged, Cathy chatting with us as we watched \"Wheel of Fortune\" on the telly, discussing favorite game shows both past and present.   Shouf's sits in a peaceful, modest suburb that I fear many Pittsburgh Yelpers will avoid since it's miles away from the buzz of the urban restaurant scene. It would be a crime for any diner to forsake their simple, pleasurable ethnic menu for more trendy eateries in the city's hub. Make the jaunt to Bridgeville, a land of milk carton-shaped homes that is a miniature railroad village made large and real, and allow yourself to be cosseted by Shouf's rustic, sincere, cherishable cuisine. You are overdue for it.",

Which is great, because it's also super delicious.   Between us, we had two meat pies, a hummus platter, and the chicken rice (I can't recall the official name of the dish, but when I inevitably mispronounced it the waitress stage whispered that saying \"rice with chicken\" would suffice). All of it was great, it was ready quickly, and the service was friendly with frequent check-ins. The small space makes the restaurant feel cozy and intimate, but you don't feel crowded.   The highlight was our server taking the time to put our leftovers into four separate boxes PLUS a plastic-wrapped bundle of pita bread to complement the second (and third) meals. I'd say Shouf's is a bit of a hidden gem.",

The gyro had a slightly different cucumber sauce than I'm normally used to having, but it didn't detract from the meal at all. The gyro meat was also cubed, not sliced.

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Fridays agowith my fiance for dinner.  I had been wanting to try Shouf's for awhile and it did not disappoint.  As soon as we walked into the restaurant I was surprised by how small the place was.  Then our waitress took us over to a second dining area in an adjoining room where there was much more seating.  The restaurant had a comfortable feeling with lots of dark woods all around.  For dinner my fiance and I decided to start off by getting the baba ghanouj while I went with the Chicken Shish Tawook and she went with the gyro platter as our entrees.  The baba ghanouj came out first in a fairly large plate with pitas and ended up being pretty tasty.  It had quite a smoky flavor to it which I have never really noticed in a baba ghanouj before and if I was pressed to tell you that I was eating eggplant, there is no way that I would have been able to.  My fiance ended up liking it too and between the two of us we easily finished it off.  Next up were our \"side\" salads that came with the entrees.  They were absolutely enormous and consisted of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and were topped with a generous serving of fresh shredded feta cheese in addition to their homemade lemon/mint/garlic Lebanese dressing.  I have to admit that I really enjoyed the salads, especially the feta and dressing, and by the time that I had finished mine I could have went home happy and full.  Since we still had our entrees coming out next that wasn't to be.  My entree ended up consisting of cubes of chicken breast marinated in garlic and olive oil over a bed of Lebanese Rice.  The chicken proved to be moist and quite tasty although I wish there would have been some more color to the dish.  In the end I only made it about half way through my dish before asking for a box to take the rest home.  My fiance similarly did not make it too far into her gyro platter and so we both had enough for our lunch the next day.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed everything that we had here and I thought that the amount of food that we received was really good for the price.",

Our server was fantastic, she made recommendations to us since we've never been there before, she also made sure we didn't order too much for the two of us...which some servers do to run up a check. I am glad we stuck to all starters so that we got to sample several menu items.  The grapeleaves were perfect, I prefer a little more lemon- but that is just my personal preference (they do serve with a lemon wedge..but for me the more the better). The spinach pie was on point, the dough was excellent and the spinach filling was delicious! We wish the meat pie had the same dough...will pass on that next time.  Kibbee was phenomenal. I'm not a fan of lamb in my kibbee, but this was incredible and I couldn't tell the difference.  Pine nuts are a plus!  The hummus....was better than mine...I'm serious...so good   I Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Absolutely love this restaurant! First time visiting, we were greeted with friendly smiles and an enthusiastic server. The food was excellent - my boyfriend and I took the advice from other reviews and shared an appetizer and entree (wanted to leave room for dessert!). We got the hummus & pita as well as a gyro platter. Both items were delicious and generously portioned. I'm a huge fan of the rice - not sure what is in it, but is so fragrant and tasty!! The hummus was super fresh and creamy as well, pairing super well with the gyro platter. We ended the meal with two desserts (baklava and chocolate cake) and two dessert drinks. Both desserts were very fresh and tasty, and the drinks were very well made. Although we lost track of time and accidentally cut it kind of close to the restaurant's closing time, we were not rushed and were seen out with friendly \"goodbye\"s and \"come again\"s from all of the employees! Looking forward to future visits!",

This place does the trick EVERY single time. We sit at the bar and hang with the bartender, who is pleasant and SUPER NICE. She can also give food and dessert advice.  My husband and I typically split a dinner because we learned the hard way they have large wonderful portions we could split and both be full.  Dessert MUST: Smurtle - turtle and s'more.  A lady makes these turtle marshmallow things in her home and they are tiny bites of deliciousness.  Kafta dinner - good enough to split for 2.  My husband and I always split this.  Their rice - not sure what's in it - is delicous and smells so good!  I've come here like 3-4 times and always get the same thing because it is that yummy.  It tastes like a home cooked meal.   I have yet to come with the belly dancer, but they told me that if you follow them on Facebook then they'll post when she comes.  I've seen belly dancers at other mediterranean restaurants in Houston and it is an experience.  I'd also say it's interesting for the entire family.",

They do have a wide variety of Lebanese dishes on the lunch and dinner menus, and also desserts (Baklava, Rice Pudding, Cake), plus a fully-stocked bar (For something different, try the Almaza beer, imported from Lebanon).  The Mazza plate is fantastic, and has a nice sampling of appetizers (If you are really hungry, and up for a challenge, you could try to eat this as a whole meal by yourself).  Breakfast on the weekends is good, but it is mostly American style offerings.  I would like to see more Levantine dishes available on the breakfast menu (the Eggs Hushwee are the closest thing to Lebanese that they have for breakfast, and they are very good, but if you ask nicely, you can get some other items that are not listed for breakfast, such as Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, and Mjuddara).  I really wished they had Ful (Foul) Medames on the breakfast menu (hint, hint).  The service is very good, the owner and staff have always been very pleasant, and I look forward to visiting again . . . Cheers!",
