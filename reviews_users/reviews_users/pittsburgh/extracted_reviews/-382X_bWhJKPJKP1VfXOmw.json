Take some pride in your establishment, fill the restaurant and prove to your patrons you belong in a theme park that serves thousands of people every day.",

I finally stopped her as she was dropping food at another table and asked for drinks when she brought the check. We were all very thirsty after eating cheeseburgers. Twenty minutes later she brought the check, no drinks. We were all disappointed and the manager waved goodbye, even though the whole group was obviously unhappy about our experience. I later saw the waitress walking and she gave me a nasty look, even though I left her a 10% tip, which she did not earn.",

The food at this JR was way better the last one I was at. The burgers were cooked well and stacked high, the fries were hot, and the salad was huge and fresh. The service was very good, with a young waitress that had to deal with the shenanigans from our table - she handled it well. And the place was super clean, surprising. Onside ring it's smack dab in the middle of the park.   As far as dessert is concerned we didn't have desert or shakes, but fro the looks of those around us who did order, they appeared very tempting.   Sometimes you have try a different location for a chain to get a True feel for how good it could be.",

    "text": "I've been to Johnny Rockets in California, DC, Maryland, and St. Louis. The Kennywood location is, by far, the worst I've ever experienced. It doesn't even deserve the Johnny Rockets name. We went to Johnny Rockets at Kennywood yesterday even though I'd had a pretty rotten experience there last year. All I wanted was their delicious fries and I really hyped the place up to our friends.   Unfortunately, no one thought it necessary to tell us that Johnny Rockets wasn't really serving Johnny Rockets' food. As soon as they brought the fries, I knew they weren't the same. In fact, they were a soggy, disgusting mess. The chicken my daughter and our friends got didn't look much better.   An employee - perhaps a manager? - came over and asked how we liked our food. I asked if they had changed their fries. He said they did and I told him that the new fries basically ruined Johnny Rockets. He then admitted that one of the employees forgot to order the fries and the chicken several days earlier so they were serving Kennywood's fries and chicken (not nearly as good at JR's and at an inflated price). The employee laughed off my complaints and said, \"thanks for your critique.\"  If you want the real Johnny Rockets experience, avoid the Kennywood location. The menu is extremely limited. The prices are double or triple what they are in other locations. And, you don't even know if you're getting real Johnny Rockets food and not some disgusting substitute. I feel bad for those who visited Johnny Rockets for the first time yesterday because they were duped into thinking they were paying for Johnny Rockets food and instead were served park fare.",

When we first went to the restaurant, it was pretty empty but we were told there was a 45 minute wait because they kitchen couldn't handle a large amount of orders and was backed up. They do have a system where they send you a text when your table is ready, so at least you will know when to go back to the restaurant. When we came back, there seemed to be some confusion about where they were actually going to seat us as some tables were apparently not \"ready\" (even though they were all empty and clean).  Our server was friendly, but there were some long wait times for simple things.  All of our food was correct (and tasty) and we all got a laugh out of the \"ketchup smiles\" they made.   One person in our group had the chicken salad, one a chili dog and two of us burgers.  Burgers were tasty and there is a nice variety but the burgers themselves are kind of small for the price that you pay. They have only been open since the end of June, so I truly believe a lot of it is just trying to get the right system and work out kinks.  I hope that it will improve with time and training. If you are looking for a place to cool off and relax in the middle of your day at Kennywood, Johnny Rockets is a good option.  Just know that it will likely take a considerable amount of time.",

Extremely long wait to sit down even though it had many empty tables. We hardly had any service of any kind, for quite a while. Drinks  in about 45 minutes (which was water for a few of us). Orders wrong IF you got it at all! Frozen foot longs.  Burgers-great taste. Which is why I give 1 star!  Bills all confused.  Server and manager discussed in length what to do.

An overpriced menu with lackluster food combined with clueless employees sets you up for an experience that you might consider skipping. Considering the restaurant was less than half full, waiting for 30+ minutes for a few burgers, a salad and chili bowl seemed a little long. I ordered the chicken club salad. Although plentiful in size, it definitely lacked in the toppings department. Chicken was advertised in their menu as thick slices, but instead I received morsel sized pieces of chicken. Hey, at least I didn't need to slice it up, right? My buddy ordered a chocolate milkshake which I tasted and found to be very thick and delicious. Long story short, skip this place the next time you're at Kennywood and opt for a couple orders of potato patch fries.",

    "text": "Oh Johnny Rockets.... Where do I begin?  When our large (11 people) group walked in,  we were informed that there would be at least a half hour wait for a seat.   Even though there were  plenty of empty tables we agreed to this stipulation because the great things we heard about food quality, not to mention the size of our group.  It was 5 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon but this particular location is in Kennywood Park and it was a 'school picnic day' so we were sort of expecting a long wait. After we were seated it took approximately 15-20 minutes before we finally met our server.  Our group was somewhat complicated order wise given that we were seated at two separate tables and had planned to pay in 4 different groups.  The (very young)waiter looked a bit confused even as he began to take our drink orders.  We explained who was on the 4 separate checks again at that point as I could see he was writing all of the drink orders on the same slip of paper.   Needless to say it was all downhill from there... I didn't get my drink until minutes before the meal arrived and only after I asked him a third time for said drink-which was only water.  After another 45 minutes the food finally started coming.  The orders themselves were screwed up too.  3 people got the completely wrong meal, with one of those people choosing to eat the item that no one had ordered just to save time.  Another person ordered a hot dog and when he bit into it, found that it was still FROZEN on the inside!  Suffice it to say, he sent it back and went to another establishment in the park. At this point I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the burgers WERE excellent and were enjoyed by those of us who got their order correctly.  But after almost 1 hour and 50 minutes of redirecting orders, sending items back, etc., no one was truly enjoying the experience at this point.  The youngest members as well as the adults of our group were very anxious to get back to riding rides in the park.  When it came time to get our checks,  we could see the server talking to the manager at length about the separate checks.  Long story short after another 15 minutes and two more interventions by various bill paying members of our group with the manager,  they agreed to comp two of the checks entirely and apologized for the whole ordeal.  The handling of the situation is the only reason I gave them an extra star. That being said however, I wouldn't recommend this location to those who are more interested in riding rides at Kennywood than waiting 2+ hours in a restaurant. Oh and as an aside,  during that whole two hours the servers only came out and sang once, which was supposed to be one of Johnny Rockets selling points-that the servers come out every half hour and break into song-glee style. Like I said, it wasn't why we were there but it's another lapse in service we experienced on this very long, very frustrating visit to Johnny Rockets.",

There was only one cashier and he rang up our drinks wrong on the receipt and we didn't realize until they delivered them he rang up a coffee and an unsweetened tea and we ordered a Pepsi and a brisk iced tea. We couldn't get our drinks fixed since they were rang up wrong in the first place. The food was really expensive for what you got. Our total came to almost sixty dollars. I got the smokehouse burger it was ok it was really dry though and the bacon was very over cooked. The burger could have used more sauce or something since it was so dry. I don't think I'd try this place inside Kennywood again maybe at another location.",

I got to Kennywood early and went straight to Johnny Rockets and entered about 11:15. My order was taken right away. It took really long to get my food. Especially since no one else was in the restaurant. I waited by the jukebox so my son would be entertained. As I was waiting I was looking around. The floors are absolutely disgusting, like they have never been cleaned. And remember I was the only customer in there at that time. I counted I believe 4 workers and they were all behind the counter some looking like they weren't doing anything! Why aren't they cleaning??  Even though I waited a good while, my food I have to say was really good. It pays being one of the first and I got some nice hot fries. I also ordered the black bean burger which I have to say was good and I'm glad I chose to get that today. I will come back since I had good food. However I will not sit down to eat unless they decide to clean.",

Had to go to counter to ask after the drinks. Discovered the burger was stone cold and returned it to total confusion of eight children behind the counter. Stood there waiting for new burger which was barely recognizable as the type I ordered. What a crappy experience. Just because we adults at a kid park doesn't mean we want crappy food and surly service. I hope you review training procedures with these staff, particularly the kid bringing out the food -- and why aren't we given plates when we eat in the restaurant??",

    "text": "Johnny Rockets is a chain restaurant that is modeled after the 50s style jukebox days. They have the old fashioned record player selection at each table and at the counter so you can select what you want to hear. No cost to it but no guarantee either that the song you picked might be played. Occasionally, some of the staff will come out and do a \"dance' to a classic tune.  It is air conditioned to get out of the heat. My daughter and I were seated at the counter. She ordered a foot long with chili and cheese. I settled for a chicken salad. Service was a bit slow but they were quick to bring it out when ready. My daughter enjoyed her meal because she was hungry. I found that my chicken was a bit tough and the greens it sat on pretty much the same way. Normally i would have sent it back but since we wanted to enjoy the park I ate it. They do specialize in shakes and floats but we didn't have the time for them.  On the plus side service was good and our waitress attentive. I did find if you look around the perimeter around the the ceiling you will find various pictures of Kennywood in yesteryears.",

The burger was \"ok\".   It was smothered in mustard and pickles, onions etc.  It was tasty but not worth the price.   I thought the fries would be like shoestring fries but they were not.  I ordered the \"large\" size and expected there to be more. The small size must be really small.    I think the restaurant is a nice touch at Kennywood.    It was nice to sit in air conditioning and use a restroom that didn't smell like a gym locker room or was hot.   The service was good and there was plenty of seating.  The food was ok - but doubt I would be back the prices are just too above average for me.",

Someone comes around and drops off your food/drinks, and takes the number.  This place is constantly busy, but being one of maybe 2 or 3 inside restaurants that Kennywood has, it's no surprise. The food is very overpriced for what you get, though. I didn't think what we got was worth what we paid. It's also VERY dirty, considering 95% of the staff work behind the counter. tables don't get wiped off in a timely manner, so you are either waiting for a clean table, or cleaning one off yourself.",

    "text": "Johnny Rockets is an indoors eatery at Kennywood that replaced what was once a multi-food vendor pavilion. They pretty much offer burgers, hot dogs, chicken fingers - those sorts of foods, but in an old fashioned, diner-inspired eatery instead of an amusement park food stand. I stopped in for my first meal here with a friend recently and have to say, I like this addition to the park. For one thing, it's air conditioned - something that I think we can all appreciate given the temperatures we've had this summer! It's admittedly not the cheapest place to eat but it's not outrageously pricey either. I think that's to be expected in an amusement park. But frankly, given the overcooked garbage other amusement parks have tried to feed me for these prices, I can't complain about Johnny Rockets at all!  My friend went with a standard cheeseburger and I went for the Route 66 (a fancy name for a swiss, 'shroom and onion burger). I'd been worried about the food quality after the place's notorious growing pains last year, but fortunately the burgers my friend and I got were both quite juicy and tasty. We were both also pleased that side salads were an option we could order, instead of us being limited to the usual \"burger and fries\" order.  Add in the fact that the staff were super friendly and the meals came to us in a timely manner (especially considering that there was a 12-person party in the building with us - the staff were juggling their duties well that day!), and we were both happy and left feeling energized and ready for more rides.  We didn't get milkshakes this time around as we wanted to get ice cream elsewhere after we left Kennywood, so no comment on those. Still, I would absolutely stop in to eat here again - as long as they weren't jam packed, at least. Sorry, but while a 30 or 45 minute break from the park is nice on a hot summer day, any more time than that is just cutting into my ride time too much!",

The $5.99 black-bean burger was the frozen kind you can get at the store for a buck.  Bun and toppings were not distinguished, but it did the job as \"amusement park food\".  The $4.39 side of fries was merely OK, with no taste, but a good portion size.  I later doused it with salt and pepper.  I downed the food with a $3.79 Pepsi which was half ice.",

It was good for family dining with a bunch of little kids. Some of these reviewers sound like they expect an Emeril Lagasse type experience. We got exactly what we expected, friendly, fun, clean and well run. Just a few items on the simple menu, probably that helps keep the orders coming out smoothly.
