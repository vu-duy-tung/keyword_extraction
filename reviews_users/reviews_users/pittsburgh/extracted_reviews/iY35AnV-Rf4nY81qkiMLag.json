And it's BYOB, with a corkage fee, which is just the icing on the cake as far as I am concerned. My friend stated that this may be her new favorite Pad Thai place. Took the hubbie on a different occasion and he stated that he still prefers Red Bowl's Pad Thai, in Cranberry, but that this was a nice change.  Service was very friendly and fast. They offer take out and lunch options as well.  The red curry with chicken was also amazing, I ordered it for takeout on a separate occasion (I've been here 3 times, and considering it's at least an hour drive from our home, thats a VERY good sign!)",

I could have gotten it spicier, but I went with 5 because I wasn't sure how hot they make their curry. It was made in 10 minutes and came with soup. The total was only $8.56. It was a good deal, Quick service, and delicious food! My only complaint is that there were only three chunks of pumpkin in the curry. I also assumed there would be eggplant since I got all vegetables, but there was not. Definitely will be trying all the kinds of curry soon!",

Lord knows the wife won't be kissing me because the garlic will be with me all night. Whew! Anyway, the service was very good, clean, but we had to ask for water twice. I mean why the small glasses of water then? Water is free or leave a pitcher. The is very good price for the strip as well. The next time I go I need to go with a different choice on the menu for sure. Cheers!",

    "text": "I heart Thai food. When on a recent mission to try as many Thai places in Pittsburgh as possible, Little Bangkok came up on my radar. What a little gem this place is! Small storefront that opens up to a larger than expected dining space in this Strip District location. Not overly Thai in the decor, but comfortable enough. But I'm not looking for multiple Buddhas or golden elephant statues. I'm hungry! And Little Bangkok delivers on flavor! The summer rolls were filled with delicious, fresh basil and mint, very refreshing and a welcome start to a good meal. The crispy veggie Bangkok roll was lightly fried and served with a sweet plum sauce that I couldn't get enough of. But the highlight for me was my entree. The drunken noodles were crazy good. These wide, stir fried rice noodles are incredible. Light and filling at the same time, drenched with a spicy basil sauce that made me want to lick my plate. The tofu was well cooked, not mushy or overly spongy like I've experienced elsewhere. My wife got the drunken rice and it was a delicious dish also.  After my first visit here, I dreamt of those fat, exquisite rice noodles. I craved them. I ordered drunken noodles from another Thai restaurant, but it didn't hold a candle to Little Bangkok. So my next visit, I ordered them again. And I was thrilled that they were everything I recalled from my first visit. I'd be hard pressed to order anything else from this tasty menu until I can get those drunken noodles out of my system! I'm thrilled that we found this yummy Thai treat in the strip! Looking forward to having another round of drunken noodles again in the near future!",

Hubby and I went for lunch on a busy Strip Saturday, excited to try a new place in a neighborhood that's filled with lots of restaurants, many of them so-so. We started with the summer roll, which looked very good when it hit the table; filled with fresh looking veggies and served with the ubiquitous peanut sauce, a favorite of mine. The issue I had with this app was that the rice paper wrapper was tough and not at all pliable. Perhaps they hadn't soaked it properly? Moving on to the mains, I had my usual green curry, this time with tofu. This curry was truly bad, with a thick, gloppy texture and oil that had separated out of the sauce. Yuck. The veggies were fresh, but had not been prepped with care, so that they were many different shapes and sizes and hadn't cooked evenly. My partner had the red curry and I must admit it looked a lot better then the green. He claimed it was not the best he'd had and not the worst. These people are very nice and, while I wish them the best, I also wish they were taking more care in the kitchen.",

The food seemed spicier than what I'm used to when asking for the same spice levels (I'm a wimp, 3-4 is my max) but it was still good and edible (too hot = I cannot eat).  The soup was good, spring rolls, and curry.  Service was fast too!  This little place should be on your list of places to check out!",

The folks here give new meaning to \"Thai spicy\" so if that's your thing, look no further (it's definitely MY thing and therefore probably one of the reasons I liked this place so much). The preparations are fresh and flavorful and the service is exceptionally warm, pleasant and attentive. A final word of warning about the spice level: TRUST them when they warn you about how authentic their spice levels are. I'm usually a 10 out of 10 on the spice meter but I went with 7 to be safe and it nearly blew my head off. Nonetheless, the food is excellent, I'd say Top 1 or 2 Thai meals I've ever had in Pittsburgh (and I've had a lot!!)",

The waiter tried to seat us at a two top right by the door when we came in, which was kind of rude, as the place was empty.

I've never tried this dish, but I liked it a lot.  They're just fried fish patties, but they were good.  The presentation was very nice as well.  Since I had to go sing, I couldn't get my Pad Thai with chicken ($11) spicy at all (Curse you, acid reflux.).  However, the portion was good, and I enjoyed the dish.  It was enough for two meals, for sure.  Our server was good, and we had water refills throughout the meal.

    "text": "This is my go to place for Thai food. I go here about twice a month, at least, for lunch. The place is normally never packed, which is great for lunch, but it is by no means empty. Some of my favorite dishes here are their Tom Kar hot pot, drunken noodles, and Pad Kra Tiem; however, my favorite dish is their Thai Rama Chicken. Thai Rama Chicken is chicken satay turned into an entree...very delicious peanut sauce and the chicken is grilled wonderfully. I've been to many Thai restaurants and can't recall any others having something similar to this with even going out of my way a couple times to ask other Thai restaurants if they could make it (to no avail).",

I had the pad kra pow with minced chicken over rice with bell peppers in a basil sauce with a fried egg. It was good, but slightly on the salty and oily side. My companion had the pad see ew, which he described as mediocre. I was not impressed with the flavor of his dish.  Prices were a little steep for the flavor and quality of the food.  The service is good, the restaurant is clean and bright. We arrived on a Thursday evening at 7:30pm; there were only 2 other patrons in the restaurant with us.  Overall, Thai Gourmet in Bloomfield is still the best value and taste in Pittsburgh's Thai food scene.",

(They should consider hiring an extra staff as it looks like the 2 waitresses there were being overworked.) It also took awhile to get our food and our check.   Nonetheless, the food was pretty tasty!  I got the Pad Kra Tiem, which was super flavorful! It came on a decent size plate filled with chicken, bell peppers, broccoli and baby corn with a bowl of rice on the side. My boyfriend got the Bangkok Spicy Basil, which he really enjoyed as well. However, the rice was harder than normal and the Thai ice tea tasted water down. We also order a chicken Tom Yum soup to share at spicy level 7 --- should have gotten a level 6. Haha.    In the end, I won't be running back here for my next meal. But if I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely consider it.",

I'm not exaggerating about the egg, the main attraction, the guitar hero of the band if thou wilt. The edges were brittle like potato chips, the yolk was hardened, and the rich flavor indicated peanut oil perhaps, but all I could think of was an alternate Earth on which I had been introduced to eggs in this style and learned to love them much earlier in life than I did.   Crispy eggs? I don't know if I can eat them any other way now. If throwing an egg onto every dish is a trend, I hope it doesn't die a quick death. The chicken, veggies, and sauce were all very tasty, but damn it if that simple egg, one that enveloped the entire top of the heap, didn't purloin the program from everything else on the plate.  And I went with a 5 on the spice level. Go on, snicker. With my acid reflux, I must be cautious, and besides, since when is food an exercise in masochism? Must all other flavors be overpowered by pain? Isn't food supposed to be pleasurable?   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cracked.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-5-most-pointless-abilities-people-love-to-brag-about%2F&s=c11fd56b067bc7f610670ebf536afbb047d3c8d83eb000939a172f7bed0186a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cracked.com/blog/the-5-m...</a>  Ahh, you're one of those, eh?  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpHvtpQ5Zrhc%26feature%3Drelmfu&s=17135fc987e46d7b94fb820a4a1c5ebd3d0515e5633e063cafaa70d8b54a3b5b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=pHvt...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-kjMlN2umoM&s=4b520e06e592af5e4f33337192582629a39a7cc51cffc1cd561de773544a41cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=-kjM...</a>  Returning from my tangent, I enjoyed my brief stay in Bangkok, and I think all but the pickiest eaters will also.

Having said that, if you find yourself suddenly in need of food, and you are completely repulsed by the lines at Pamela's, Deluca's, Wholey's, Luke Wholey's, and Roland's (tip: you shouldn't be going to Roland's), and/or you just prefer Thai food--you should go to this place. The chicken satay was cooked perfectly, and the sauce delicious. Get the fresh spring rolls, they're great. The pad see eiw was completely proficient.

    "text": "Food: Little Bangkok has two separate menus online; the standard menu and the vegan menu.  Unfortunately, when a group of 8 of us went, 3 of us intending to order vegan, we were told that over half of the items on the online vegan menu were not actually vegan.  Multiple order requests were shot down for not being vegan and being made with egg or fish sauce.  Even the curry dishes, which at most Pittsburgh Thai restaurants are vegetarian/vegan friendly, were not.  Menu items are ordered on the 1-10 spicy scale.  We split the fresh summer rolls, which were huge and tasty.  Rather than being served as an entire roll, they were cut into individual pieces, like sushi, making it much easier to eat as a group.  No soups were vegetarian friendly.  The non-vegetarian eaters in our party seemed to enjoy the crab wonton, but said they had tasted better in the city.  The Pad Eee Eil was very bland and lacked flavor both at low spicy levels and high.  The sweet and sour was considerably more tasty than the Pad Eee Eil but was not as good as variations from other Pittsburgh Thai restaurants.  The meat eaters in the group seemed to enjoy the green curry and other dishes, but no one was blown away by their meal.      Price: Most appetizers are $6 or less, soup ranges from $5-7 per bowl with hot pot option available, and entrees range from $10-15.  The prices are very reasonable.  Drinks: BYOB. There are fees for wine and beer.  Atmosphere: The dining room is very modestly decorated and wide open.  Tables can accommodate small and large parties.  We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and we were the only ones in the entire restaurant.  We made a reservation, but this probably isn't necessary.  Service: The waiter was attentive and helpful, and did his best despite delivering bad news (for us) about the menu repeatedly.  The staff does not speak great English, and there was some confusion about some of the orders.  One order that was specifically requested not to have egg came out with egg, and that person had to wait for another meal to be prepared while we ate our meals.  The chef came out to apologize and thank us, and she was very friendly.  The staff was patient while we stayed beyond their closing time finishing our wine.  (+): affordable, friendly staff  (-): average to below-average Thai food, online menu does not match real menu  Would I go back again? No. Pittsburgh is loaded with awesome Thai restaurants.  Unless I hear that Little Bangkok has significantly improved, I likely will not go back.",

The waiter and now the owner have come to know us, but the service has always been very attentive. My favorite is the Drunken Noodle, which I usually have with chicken. It is always a good mix of flavors, and there is just something so satisfying about the texture of the wide noodles. My husband's favorite is Spicy Basil. Their spicing is so good that we don't have to ramp up our numbers to get some kick. We always start out with veggie Tom Yum, which is a symphony of textures and flavors. We have tried other things on the menu, which are always good, but seem to come back to this standard order. He likes to accompany his with Thai iced tea. I recommend the ginger tea, a spicy brew that is just right with the food. Most recently, I got home from a conference where all the food was good, but bland, and we almost raced there for a lunch that woke up our senses.",

I had the red curry with shrimp, my partner had pineapple curry with tofu, and we shared the chicken satay, which came with TWO out of this world sauces - a perfectly balanced peanut sauce and one with red onion and cucumber. We arrived at about 5:30 PM on a Thursday night in July, and had the place all to ourselves, which was totally amazing given how awesome this place is. (Maybe we just got lucky since it was early. Also - parking was no problem - the lot behind Penn Mac was empty at that time of day.) Our waitress was gracious and attentive, and the food came out FAST! Just for the sake of comparison: We love Nicky's on the North Side, and I have to say that this place is every bit as good.

Little Bangkok is a smallish restaurant, sandwiched between other dining establishments on Penn Avenue. The dining area only has a small number of tables, so it's a good thing the restaurant wasn't too busy this evening. On the plus side, since the staff had only a small number of tables to watch over, service was pretty good. Water refills were given without my even having to ask.  The food is pretty good. It's different and possibly more authentic than other Thai restaurants I've tried. I had the Thai Rama Chicken this time with a spiciness level of 6. That wasn't actually very spicy until I got to the chilis under the chicken. The price seemed a bit steep for Thai food but the portion size was quite generous.",

    "text": "Little Bangkok was next in line for my self appointed mission to eat at every Thai restaurant in the city and surrounding area. I know! Not a bad task!!! I embrace it with enthusiasm! And so it was that the four us set out to try this peculiar little store front on Penn avenue. We brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate some recent events and elected to sit outside on a gorgeous day at one of the 2 or 3 tables on the crowded sidewalk. Although it can be, at first, distracting with all the pedestrian traffic, we settled in to some people watching, aided by the champagne. Yum.   The menu has some different entrees than other Thai places and to aid in your selection, there are poster boards with photos of some of the food surrounding you. To be frank, these pictures look like grade school attempts at food photography and are more off putting than enticing. But ignore those. The food is way better than those pics!!  We started with some fresh spring rolls which I always find to be a good test of what the food may be like. These were superb! Fresh ingredients and super tasty. Highly recommended. I ordered the Pad Kraw Pow - minced chicken and bell peppers in a spicy basil sauce over steamed rice and topped with two sunny side up eggs. It was quite tasty and the spice level was as requested. My only minor complaint is that the chicken was minced a little too fine for my taste. I would rather have had it in chunks. My wife got the Pad Kra Tiem with mixed seafood and was the hands down winner. Over a bed of veggies and with loads of garlic and pepper sauce, this was a knockout.   The two vegetarians ordered tofu dishes - drunken noodles and drunken rice - both huge hits. I sampled just a taste and wholeheartedly agree. Delightful!   Service was a tad slow but not annoyingly so. Could be because we ate outside. We didn't get charged the listed $3 corkage fee which was a nice bonus!   If you're in the strip and are craving some flavorful Thai food, you can't go wrong here!! Try it!!",

Little Bangkok in the Strip on Penn Ave. was Sunday's choice and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be!   Everything the 4 of us ordered was delicious! We started with fresh spring rolls with 12 pieces on the plate. Nice size serving and tasty.   I loved the Pad Kra Tiem with a flavorful garlic and pepper sauce over lots of veggies with seafood. Mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari in that delectable sauce. Call me happy!   My hubby ordered the Pad Kra Pow, a basil sauce with chicken and topped with 2 over easy eggs. There was some yummy sampling back and forth with both our dishes.    The girls ordered Drunken Noodles and Drunken Fried Rice, both with tofu. Both loved the flavors and although the names sounded similar, they were very different and each tasty in their own right. They're pretty picky on the preparation of their tofu and both were very pleased and their entrees were large enough to take a lot home.  There are some unique and delicious flavors coming out of this Thai kitchen and I'm looking forward to going back again very soon!",

I give a 4 really only because the atmosphere. We were able to sit outside on the sidewalk which was nice because it was it was perfect weather but the patio furniture could be a little nicer/cleaner. The interior seemed very clean. The prices are pretty average.   Red curry is my absolute favorite anytime I get Thai and this place did not disappoint! The  curry was slight thicker than I've had elsewhere but it was delicious nonetheless. The curry spice scale is 3-10. 4 was hot enough for me. The husband got a 6 for his green curry and it was also good. I like some spice but not too much and I could eat a 6 if that's helps. I always get extra veggies and tofu which they were happy to do for me. The fried tofu app was better than I've had at some places except I didn't like that they put a lot of peanuts on the spicy sauce that comes with it.   As far as dessert goes, if you like sticky rice, you must get the coconut sticky rice with coconut ice cream! It is amazing! So amazing, I want some now! If you've never had sticky rice and you don't know what I'm talking about, you must get the coconut sticky rice with coconut ice cream! I'd like to try the mango sticky rice too but it was out of season while we were there.   I will definitely be back!",

The only thing I didn't like was the tofu that they used wasn't firm enough but that's okay. It also could've been a bit spicier but thats just what I prefer. They also have good Pad Thai that isn't overpowered by a peanut taste and they understand the importance of having the lime flavor. One thing I loved about the pad Thai was that there were big chunks of real chicken. Made it a lot heartier. I was sufficiently full after eating this meal. I also ordered the crispy Thai rolls which were super cute because they were basically mini spring rolls. They were a bit mushy but I think it's because I got it from Postmates. Decently priced. I'd order from here again.",

As we were walking around, we stumbled upon this place because the sign on the restaurants had pictures of dishes that looked amazing. So we went in looked at the menu and decided to eat our dinner here. We got two appetizers, Bangkok roll and Steamed Dumplings, which were both delicious. My friend got the Pad See Ew, which he really enjoyed and I got the Chicken Pineapple Curry Spice level 5. This was my first ever time trying Curry, and let me tell you, it was delicious!! The spice level was perfect because you could taste the flavors yet it still left an after burn in your mouth that lingered for a bit and the pineapples added a nice sweet touch to all the heat going on. I am definitely now hooked on Curry and highly recommend this place! It is amazing!",

Then add tons of fresh veggies and a plethora of pineapple and it really hot the spot. I really appreciated how seasoned everything was. Not just salt, not just spice (I went with a level 3 and it was just a light lingering heat).  It was really good fried rice.   The crab wontons were slightly greasy, but tasty. The thick sweet sauce was a perfect addition to the rice too.   I ordered delivery through GrubHub. The food traveled very well and I'll definitely do delivery (and probably eat in) again.   I have to post an update. I ordered the same thing. But the gentleman who delivered my food said he worked here too. I was struggling with a package when he showed up with my food. He went above and beyond to deliver my food, offer me help, and wish me a lovely evening. It sounds like a little thing, but I can't tell you how many times people just walk by. To hire people like this, I'll keep coming back!",

They've been getting orders incorrect and whoever is making the soup needs to learn some knife skills or needs to be trained in proper size ratios for the human mouth. I wasn't going to post a picture, but this is the 2nd large cabbage root I found in the same order of soup. The same thing happened in the past 2 orders I got there too, but because I've had a high percentage of good food there I have them the benefit of the doubt.

Our severs were very pleasant and the food was prepared and served quickly.  My husband had Pad See Ew with beef, and I had Drunken Noodles with chicken.  We liked that they let you pick the spice level from the low end of 1 all the way up to high end of 10.  My husband picked one of the numbers on the lower end, and I picked an 8.  It was just ok, maybe a little bit salty, and not spicy enough for me.  Next time I should go with a 10 and not worry about crying over Drunken Noodles.",

We ordered the Fresh Bangkok Summer Roll, Pad Thai with tofu, and Drunken Fried Rice with vegetables. They offered spice level of 0 to 10 for the Pad Thai and Drunken Fried Rice, and we chose 3 for both.   The Summer Roll was refreshing and light, so it serves for a good appetizer. The Pad Thai tasted standard to me: good, but doesn't particularly stand out. On the other hand, I quite liked the Drunken Fried Rice flavor. The Drunken Fried Rice is noticeably spicier than the Pad Thai, likely because the Drunken Fried Rice is made spicy in nature. Would definitely recommend the rice for its good flavor!  Overall not bad, the lunch specials are a good deal. Since we ate family style, it ended up being ~$8 for each of us plus the price of the drinks we individually ordered.",

My grandfather ordered the Pad Keing. It's a dish with ginger as the base for the sauce. It came with vegetables and he selected chicken as his meat. It also came with rice. He really enjoyed it. He ordered a 5 out of 10 for spice level but said he could of gotten it spicier. The ginger was very dominant. If you like ginger, this is a great dish for you.   I went with my staple green curry. I also ordered a 5 but could of gone spicier. My dish also came with rice. It was standard in flavor but a large portion. I would order it again.

I've never been here before but a couple of my coworkers really like this place.  We walked in at 1pm and there was hardly anybody there.  We had 8 people with us so we were easily able to get a table right away.  The lady who was our hostess was also our waitress too.  So you get the picture.  Nice lady though.   I think the plates were a little over priced for lunch but if you like spicy food they really make it spicy for you.  So if you're into hot stuff then this might be the place for you to try out for lunch.  I like spicy food but I'm not ordering it for lunch on a work day.  So I looked around at the menu and I saw \"Shrimp\" and \"Pork\" dumplings as an appetizer.  I wasn't too hungry so this worked for me.  I have never ordered dumplings before at a restaurant but my wife made some good ones at home before.  She loves them so I wanted to try them out. They didn't take too long and they looked good.  They gave me some dipping sauce and they were good.  You could taste the pork but I really like the shrimp in them.  Again it was just tan appetizer so it just hit the spot for me.  They weren't spicy but I wasn't expecting them to be.  You could probably get them spicier if you asked. My coworker's lunches came out actually one at a time which was a little weird.  They got a lot of food and rice.  The ones that got something spicy really liked their lunch.  Everybody else thought it was just ok.  I liked my dumplings a lot.   I think it's a little over priced for lunch but it is a good lunch spot in the Strip if you want something spicy!",

It might just be that it feels kind of tucked away and so maybe not many people know about it.   Among the five of us a few got curry, two pad thais and a pad see ew. For dessert we got a mango sticky rice.   The food was excellent and we really didn't wait very long considering the size of our group. I'd definitely come back when I have a hankering for Thai.",

    "text": "Good Thai food in the Strip District!! Came on a Wednesday evening and there was no one there except for my family and I. The waitress was extremely welcoming and friendly and made us feel as if we were at home.   The food is very fresh, is plated nicely, and tastes great. For appetizers, we had the summer rolls and fish cakes. The summer rolls were refreshing on a humid summer day and had lots of mint and crisp veggies in them. The fish cakes melted in my mouth and were not greasy. For the main course, I had the seafood drunken noodles with a spice level of Thai hot 10. They have a normal spice scale and a Thai spice scale, so if you're insane like me and can eat 20 habaneros raw, then go with the Thai spice scale. However, I was expecting more spice than what it had, because my mouth unfortunately was not on fire. Despite that, I loved everything about the drunken noodles. It was a generous portion and it had veggies in it and lots of seafood. The noodles were cooked just right and not too mushy.  Overall, Little Bangkok is a good place for Thai in the heart of the Strip District. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "We stopped in Little Bangkok on a Saturday evening.  They have a nice store front in the Strip.  There is some outdoor seating that seemed to be the coveted area of the evening as those tables were full but inside only one other couple was dining.  They have a rather gracious inside space, so I don't think reservations are really needed.  Our service was pleasant.  We were waiting on by a man and women.  Our orders were taken quickly, our food came out quickly, and our water glasses never went past half full.  So service was a knock out.  The food was a little less knock out, but overall still good.  We ordered two orders of the fresh Bangkok summer rolls.  They came with tofu and the flavor was spot on.  They had lots of fresh mint and basil which a lot of places tend to overlook.  I loved the flavor, but they were poorly rolled.  Several of the pieces fell apart as I picked them up with my chops.  I had to use my fork to finish eating the ones that came unraveled on me.  Taste delicious, execution needed some tweaking.  For my entree I ordered my go to Thai, Drunken Noodles, or some places call Pad Kee Mao.  I order a spice level of 10 out of 10, but opted out of Thai hot to be cautious.  I got my noodles with Tofu and the tofu was some of the best I have had in any Thai restaurant.  Perfectly cut to portion and cooked well.  Not spongy, yet absorb the flavors of the dish well without being soggy.  Very good.   However the noodles were a major disappointment.  One of the main reasons I get these flat rice noodle dish is because I have an obsession with the wide rice noodles they are served  with.  Little Bangkok serves their dishes with a thin rice noodle, and they were ripped to shreds so much so that a spoon would have sufficed better than a fork let alone some chop sticks to eat with.  What a shame as the flavors, again, were pretty good.",

The restaurant space is nice though it was a little awkward when the place was empty. The service was very good, our waitress who was also seating folks was super friendly. They have your standard Thai fare at prices that are comparable if not a little pricier than similar Thai places in Pittsburgh. I had the pineapple curry which was excellent, the 8/10 spice definitely had some kick to it too. I tried some else's Pad Thai and I wasn't crazy about it, it was a little bland. Worth checking this place out.",

The store front is small from the outside and may be easily missed by pedestrians, but once you find Little Bangkok you won't want to go anywhere else! The inside atmosphere is cute and cozy in True East Asian fashion. The owner is so sweet and she is serving tables most of the time so service is always hit out of the park. I have never tasted anything bad on their menu and I love that you have the option to choose your spice level from one to ten. Their traditional pad Thai is loaded with peanuts and is absolutely fantastic. Another favorite of mine is the drunken fried rice that includes combo meats- chicken, beef, and shrimp. The portions are also huge and so reasonably priced. Their food is such genuine Thai and is definitely the best Thai cuisine I have had. Little Bangkok is perfect for all engagements, from a business lunch, to a solo grab for takeout, and even a family dinner.",

The fish cakes were spongy and chewy like those you find in Chinese hot pot. They were deep fried too and came with a sweet chili sauce. Would not recommend. The yellow curry had a decent amount of spice in it, making my dad crave more rice. It was also kind of sweet and a large portion. The garlic beef was way too salty. I had already eaten a decent amount before my dad suggested asking for them to remake it. We tried to complain to the waitress, but she just asked us if we wanted more rice to wash it down.   Overall, I would have given this place 3 stars had it not been for the fact that I love Thai food and want to come here to try other things. Normally I'd get pad Thai or pad see ew but I thought I'd try new things this time, to no success. The most promising dish was their Thai iced tea, not too sweet and a beautiful transformation!",

The spice was just right for me at an 8, and the spices and flavor of the noodles were excellent.  The vegetables accompanied with some basil were also quite fresh and provided a lot of flavor.    Now the only reason it is not receiving 5 stars for me is the lack of ambiance and finishing touches in the place.  It's frankly, barren in the place.  Also, when we were there during the evening it was super cold in the place.  My partner couldn't even take his scarf off.  With that in mind, I would recommend this place to everyone!",

    "text": "I was in the mood for some spicy thai food to fight off the cold on this snowy Sunday afternoon. While Nicky's had just opened downtown, we were looking for some coffee and other supplies in the strip and I figured I'd give this place a shot.   The restaurant is sparsely decorated, having two levels with a dozen or so tables. We were shown to our seat and presented with a lunch menu. A handful of curries and popular noodle dishes, all from $7-9, plus a few appetiziers, Tom Yum Soup, and a few rice dishes. Their full menu is also available at lunch, with prices in the $12-15 range.  The waiter gave us  water and took our order, each of us getting a chicken Tom Yum Soup and me getting a green curry with beef(10 spicy), and my friend getting a chicken Pad See Eil(7 spicy). The soup arrived first, sadly not being very flavorful - Mostly of standard chicken broth with an afterthought of lemongrass. It had a few pieces of carrot and some cilantro and flavorless chicken, and no spice to be found at all.  The main dishes arrived shortly after - I wasn't able to try my friend's Pad See Eil, but the green curry was passable. Containing mostly peppers and bamboo shoots, the few pieces of beef were tough, but the flavor of the green curry was decent enough to satisfy me. The curry was full of chiles, but unfortunately they did little to provide the spice I was hoping for. I'd have rated the dish I was given at a 6 or so. My friend was able to finish her Pad See Eil, but had no strong words to say about it one way or the other.   The service was quick, but water was never refilled. The whole experience cost about $25 which I thought was a decent price for lunch. The portions were satisfying, not huge(But I also decided go without rice), which left me in a good mood and ready to wander through the snow again.  If I'm ever in the Strip, I'd consider stopping by again, but it's more likely that I'll wind up at Nicky's. For a quick thai food fix, though, the fare here is decent",

Finally ate there last night, because of the Pirates game, and not wanting to have to fight traffic at Nicky's.  I am going to be hitting this place as often as I can until I get burned out.  Wife had the drunken noodles.  She asked for spice level 6, which was still really mild,  Really really really delicious!  She had it with beef, which is not a tenderized type of meat you get in most places, but a hard cooked really well seasoned kind of dried out chunks of meat, which is EXACTLY how you get it in the home of a Thai.  REALLY authentic.  I got he Pad Kra Tiem (garlic) with beef.  Spice level 6.  Mine was nice and spicy, absolutely great!!!  And, just ask for extra crushed peanuts, and you also ask for the side platter of seasonings.  Oh, and got the spring riolls as well.  They are vegan, and amazingly good!  Instead of a couple of big rolls wrapped in rice paper, you get a platter, of smaller rolls, that are sliced up and served around a bowl of peanut sauce.  The one thing I hate about most Thai places is, they do not use galangel, or tamarind, and you leave the place saying, \"it LOOKED nice, but the taste was missing something...\"  Well, you will not get that \"missing something\" at this place.  If you do not like the food here, it is because you just have a different flavor profile than I do.  I spent years in the Air Force, long enough ago so that most of my supervisors had Thai wives, and this food nailed what I used to get when I would go to their homes for dinner.",

Flavours was all over the place, the no milk curry was two dimensional, basically chili water and the fried rice was overly wet (therefore drunken rice?) and super salty and sweet. I'm from south east Asia and been to Thailand many times and this was one of the weirdest American Thai places I've tried.

    "text": "I ate here this past Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend and her parents for lunch.  My girlfriend and I have walked by this place many times in the past but had kept it on our list of places to try.  We arrived here at about 11:15 or so and the place was completely empty.  As a matter of a fact after we seated what looked like a fresh cut flower was placed on every table except for ours, presumably not to interrupt us.  It was then that I noticed the beautiful bouquets of fresh flowers by the door.  Other than the flower though, the place seemed fairly plain.  After we were seated, we were given menus opened to the lunch special page.  What I liked about it is that they had about 20 or so choices that all cost exactly the same depending on the type of meat that you were getting and only one item on the lunch menu cost more than the rest. Since I normally eat the same thing at every Thai place, I decided to switch it up and went with the beef Jungle Curry at a spice level 10 out of 10.  It was a non coconut based curry with eggplant, bamboo, baby corn, bell pepper, carrot and a side of rice.  We also decided to have the fish cakes and crab wontons appetizer.  The appetizer came out first and was pretty good.  The crab wontons had a good savory filling and were much more delicate than I expected and paired nicely with the sweet and sour sauce.  Meanwhile the fish cakes were not what I was expecting as they sort of looked, felt and tasted like sausage but were still good.  As a nice surprise our lunch specials were also served with soup which none of us had noticed on the menu.  The soup was a light broth with some carrots, other vegetables and tofu in it and carried and had a very pleasing heat and the finish.  Finally my Jungle curry was very good.  The spice level was prefect and I also thought that most of the flavors were good as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  All of the food that I tried was good, they put a good amount of spice in my food and I thought that the lunch specials were very affordable and fair for what you got.",

    "text": "Woohoo!  AMAZING Thai food in Pittsburgh.   No need to settle for sub-par pad thai- this place is what you would get in Thailand- at a solid restaurant.  My favorite dish is the Thai Rama Chicken: chicken and vegetables in a light yellow curry with homemade peanut sauce.  It's the peanut sauce that's mind blowing.  Excellent depth of flavor, thick and delicious, and fresh peanuts with a touch of spice.  Probably better for takeout than dine-in, but hopefully this place gets plenty of local support and maybe then the restaurant itself will fill out.   But really, the food speaks for itself.  In the best way possible.",

    "text": "Excellent Thai.    Just opened this week so not real crowded, but it will be.  Started with some soup with scallions and rice, very good.  Ordered the Green Curry which is a curry paste with coconut milk, eggplant, bamboo shoots yellow peppers, and order it with shrimp (other options are pork, chicken, veggie..probably more).  All very fresh, tasty, cooked perfectly and delicious!   Spice is rated from 3 to 10.  Had it 6 (my usual) and it was very spicy and flavorful.  A ten must be unbelievable.  The restaurant is small with a minimalist decor but nice.    The Chef, Penny, came out to greet the tables.  She gets most of the produce from the local markets and only cooks the food to order, so no precooked items.  Also, it is BYOB.  For those that live downtown or in the Strip,  you have a new place U can walk to!",

    "text": "I have eaten here 4 times now (three times takeout), and have to say... this place is great!  Having been to all of the \"good\" Thai places in Pittsburgh, this may be my favorite Thai food.  The green curry and red curry are amazing!  Quite possibly the best I've ever had.  The drunken noodles were great.  There is something on the menu in the fried rice section that is topped with an over easy egg... I was a little skeptical at first, but wow!  I will order that again.  I've ordered everything at a 7/10 spicy level, and its perfect for me.  Spicy, but not over powering by any means. The food is made from fresh ingredients, which, can be hard to find in Asian restaurants.  The ambiance is nothing special, a nice, clean atmosphere.  There was no one in there when I've been there, but don't be discouraged, there will be once word gets out.  The server was great.  The only downside in my opinion is that they don't take American Express... a pet peeve of mine.  If you are looking for a great place for Thai, this is it!  Oh, an it's BYOB!!!",

    "text": "AWESOME! The best Thai food I ever tried.  When on the strip you need to eat here. The drunken rice with shrimp is incredible.  I ordered it with a 7 heat scale.  If my wife wasn't with me, I would have licked the plate clean.  She frowns upon me reverting to my animal nature.   My wife had the drunken noodles with chicken with a 2 heat scale, she loved it.   She found it had a little too much heat, but she still ate everything. Something I have never seen her do in 16 years of marriage.  We ordered the cheese wontons for an appetizer, and they were the best my wife and I ever had.  The wonton was delicate and flakey.  The cheese was tasty.  If you love asian food, you need to try this place.  I live 2 hours away.  I will be coming back sooner than planned, just to eat at this great restaurant.",
