Only the dinner menu was offered during lunch time on New Year's Eve so that was also really disappointing.. We got there slightly after 12 noon.....not really up for 5 courses, but wanted to take my sons for their bdays (they also wouldn't deduct the $15 they advertise on their menu as the Birthday special when purchasing 4 hibachi dinners). Because we had to order Hibachi dinners with 5 courses, rather than the Lunch Hibachi with 3 courses, we ended up with a super expensive lunch (over $125 with waitress tip - not counting the chef's tip), and had to leave leftovers in the car while we shopped at The Waterfront.  The Manager (older tall guy no uniform on) was talking to the hostesses and didn't acknowledge our party leaving....really rude considering we passed the hostess stand to exit and again because the \"only dinner menu\" rule meant hibachi for four was really expensive for lunch. Not very friendly overall between waitress, hostesses, manager (chef was good). Forcing customers at lunch time to order 5 course meals to pad their revenue is just wrong. Yes, we stayed willingly because it was both of my sons' birthdays, but with many other nice restaurants in Pittsburgh, doubt we will go back.",

There are a couple servers I will always avoid. But over all its a very great and pleasant place to eat. The only thing we ALL cringe at is that one of the managers is constantly yelling at someone. Whether a server bar tender host or hostess he is ALWAYS yelling and reprimanding in front of customers! These are paying guests (for now) that will most likely never come back.... They almost lost my service quite a few times.... I have seen the same manager sitting at the bar on his phone with a coat and winter hat on as well while the phone rang over and over and the hosts were busy seating people and doing what looked like helping servers deliver drinks etc...for the ENTIRE time I was there attempting to enjoy my meal in a booth with friends. He is just disrespectful to his employees and I'm not quite sure why he is even still a manager at all. He has made my server cry by yelling (and swearing) at her in front of us (and children). I have gone many times when an asian manager was there or a blonde young female recently. They seemed to be polite and helpful. Ive had enjoyable meals there those times. A few good servers and the great food are the ONLY reason we return. The atmosphere is not so pleasant when that certain manager Is there.",

PROS: Clean (Much more so than Sho-gun of Monroeville, due to being newer) Great Sushi Nice Staff Full Bar Area & Nice Atmosphere  CONS: a bit pricey VERY busy on weekends! The potential to get \"stuck\" sitting with an a-hole is possible due to the seating around the hibachi grills.  DINNER SUGGESTIONS: \"Steak (Filet) & Shrimp Combo with Mushroom Appetizer\" (you'll get the fried rice and veggies plus a nice amount of shirmp and beef, but you'll also get extra mushrooms on your plate which are delicious)  If you're looking for this type of food (Japanese Steakhouse/Hibachi), then Yokoso is a great choice.  Its not as trendy or conveniently located in Southside as Nakama--which we like, but Yokoso is a lot newer and cleaner than Sho-gun and its still very easy to get to (and park at) considering its just in the Homestead Waterfront.",

During my most recent visit, the server was very young and seemed eager to serve the food quickly (so our table could be cleared). When my friend asked for a recommendation on wine, the server replied several times that she had no knowledge of wine before my friend finally asked her to consult with a bartender. The sushi was delicious and the hibachi was fine, but seemed a little less flavorful than usual. I am not sure if this was due to the seasoning, or due to the fact that we weren't seated at a hibachi table where the meal was cooked in front of us. Despite that, every other member of the staff we interacted with (including the manager) was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, it was a successful meal and this will still be a standard waterfront location for a convenient dinner.",

We ordered a steak and shrimp hibachi plate and 3 rolls (Dragon, New York, and Pittsburgh).  The hibachi plate was pretty good and came with the green onion soup.  It was priced reasonably for the quality and quantity.    The sushi was delicious too, but I don't have a discerning palate.  I'm a fan of the fast-food ish sushi places in Oakland by Pitt, which are cheaper, but I can't confidently tell you that Yokoso's rolls, because it costs a tad more, tastes better.  It's definitely got a better selection, though, than the sushi places by Pitt.  I'm not sure if that alone is enough to warrant a trip here (if we ignore the hibachi for a second).  Overall, the bill wasn't bad at all, especially considering we doggie bagged and got great service.  I have a feeling this place might be better for lunch than for dinner.  I have no idea what the live Hibachi experience at this place is like, though.",

Requested managers and there solution to the problem was to make me wait another 30min for food to be remade and still charged me full price after refusing to remove the mushrooms. The managers also decided to charge me full price for an incorrectly made sushi roll (which fell apart in rice chunks) that should've have been half price because its was 50% off specialty sushi night. This ruined my evening dinner with my loved ones after a long day of work we will never eat here again. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE",

Our waitress was nice though our hibachi chef was hilarious and very outgoing which made for a pleasant experience. If you do go, I would suggest asking for Colin. You can tell he really loves his job and has been hibachi-ing for 11 years now or so he says.

I have been there during both lunch and dinner--weekdays and weekends--and have sampled the hibachi and sushi.  And for the most part, the food is very good.  The restaurant recently revamped its menu and I've noticed an overall slight price increase.  More noticeable are the changes to their sushi menu, where some rolls have been removed and shifted while new, inventive rolls take their place.  Sushi selections are pictured in a large, colorful menu that shows pictures along with detailed ingredients for each roll.  And while this is extremely helpful for visual individuals, I still find it slightly overwhelming having to scan over twenty different roll varieties.  However, the new additions sound tasty, with both the Yum Yum and Lobster Cali Rolls being two of my favorites thus far.  Thus far, I have experienced good, quality service whenever I've decided to stop by for a quick bite or to place an order to go.  The wait staff is engaging and friendly and I have never had any delays with my food.",

I didn't care for the eel sauce (Justin liked it, though!), but the roll itself was delicious. We ordered two meals from the Hibachi Lunch Menu, I got the NY Strip Steak and Chicken and Justin got the NY Strip Steak and Shrimp. They both came with soup or salad to start and also hibachi vegetables and fried rice. The portions were very healthy for lunch. The fried rice was delicious and so, so much better than the last time I was there. The rest of the meal was good, too. The steaks were well cooked and seasoned, but my chicken was slightly dry.   I've only ever been here for lunch, and don't know that this is a place I would even come for dinner. The price point goes up significantly, and while the food is good, I worry I would be disappointed with a dinner service. It's never too busy when I'm there for lunch, so I'm not too sure what the atmosphere is like in the evening. The service I've received here hasn't been BAD per say, but it hasn't been great. The staff is always very nice, but aren't necessarily the most efficient. It just seems like everyone is a little sluggish or apathetic.   So, all in all, if you are looking for a decent lunch while at the Waterfront, this is a good option. If you work at the Waterfront, they offer a Waterfront discount, you just have to ask. I don't really know the stipulations, but maybe bring a pay stub or something just in case! They also offer half price sushi rolls on Tuesdays, which is a fantastic deal.",

It's a little over priced, but most places in the Waterfront are just  a bit. They do run specials during the week of half off special rolls which is a deal.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  It's not the best sushi in Pittsburgh, but it does the trick. Alcohol Selections are pretty good with a seasonal on tap. Not sure on happy hour prices.",

    "text": "Short version:  We got up and left after sitting at the table for 40 minutes without any sign of the hibachi chef and numerous excuses by the apathetic staff of why they were backed up.  Long version: The place is an example of how not to operate a restaurant.  We stopped in for dinner on a weeknight, and the place did not seem busy at all.   When we asked for hibachi for 2 people, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.   We were in no rush so we agreed and they told us they would send us a text when we could be seated.  Fast forward 30 minutes, the text never arrived so we returned to the restaurant.  They said they were having issues with their notifications system and they could seat us.   Okay fine no big deal.    We get seated at the hibachi table along with some other parties.   A waitress comes over and takes our drink and food orders.  We get our drinks and about 20 minutes passes.   The waitress re-appears and tell us they are out of soup and brings us our salads.   We wait another 20 minutes.     While we were waiting, one of the other guests accidentally spills her drink on the hibachi grill top in plain sight of the waitress.   She does not clean it up and does not ask anyone else on the staff to clean it up either.  Finally after 40 minutes of waiting at the table, we decide to cut our losses and go across the street to another restaurant.",

We sat in a front booth since we were not ordering hibachi. The hundreds of diners who have sat at these booths have destroyed the padding making them uncomfortable. In addition, the diner with her back to me pushed back against my side of the booth over and over again. We ordered the tempura sampler platter which was well fried without any greasy taste. However, the spring rolls tasted mushy and the shrimp shumai did not have much flavor. We also ordered the Spicy California Rolls and the Japanese Mafia #2. Both choices were freshly made as we watched and quite tasty.",

The bartender/server did an outstanding job as her tip reflected. The food was excellent and the portions where huge, sashimi.  On our way out the male manager and \"cell phone \" hostess looked us in the eyes and did not say one word as we exited. I definitely believe great customer service makes a restaurant a whole, if the staff was more friendly (excluding our bartender/sever she was awesome and friendly) I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars.  If I were the manager, I would have all employees place their phones in a lockbox unless on break or finished their shift for the day. The hostess played on her phone 95% of the time while we ate lunch.",

I started with the Spider Roll, a combination of of course rice and a seaweed wrap that has soft shell crab tempura, avocado, crab and cucumber add in a little wasabi sauce and eel sauce and you got yourself a combination you never want to stop coming.  So much so I was gonna venture off but stayed with this for 3 orders.  15 pieces of sushi and $20 later I couldn't be any happier.  The rolls came quick,the bartender served them with a smile and the price well, the price was worth every hard earned cent.  For the health conscious keep in mind what I ate was a total of 1000 calories and it surely will keep me full long through the evening.  The drinks are a little expensive but that's the price you pay for convenience at any restaurant.  They are always generously made and the beer is always cold.  The staff always welcomes me with open arms and throws in any extras you may need without a grunt like pickled ginger, wasabi, lemons and sauces.    I've been here before and now that I know about this day of the week I'll be coming back a bit more often but next time, with lots of people!",

Our waitress asked for drink orders and I asked for a vodka tonic, not an unreasonable request. After the entire party was served, except for myself, she comes back to the table and asks if I just want a shot of vodka or it mixed with water. I told her, again, I would like a vodka tonic with a slice of lime. She goes to the bar and comes back with a glass of vodka with a splash of water, and a lemon. I asked her if she had any tonic water and she said yes but the machine must be replaced, so she brings me a second glass, the same way, this time with no garnish. By this point I am livid but keep my mouth shut and enjoy the company of my friends. My dinner finally arrives and I have chewy burnt scallops with burnt shrimp. When I say this place would be my last choice of hibachi, it would be a lie. I would NEVER come back to this place EVER EVER EVER. Worst most horrible hibachi experience of my entire existence!!!!",

I can get some errands done and run over for some sushi.    - Sushi Tsunami Tuesdays - 1/2 price on rolls - The picture-filled sushi menu.  They have the specialty rolls listed in the regular menu, but if you need a more complete description, they have a picture version that you can use to better visualize what you are getting.  - The sushi.  The rolls are a tad rice-heavy for me; but other than that, I am always happy with what I order.    The bad:   - The service.  With the exception of this last visit, the service is generally very poor.  Slow, inattentive, etc. - you always get the impression that they resent being there to wait on people.   - The prices are a tad on high side for what you get.    - The general practice of asking whether you want the wasabi/ginger dish.  This is really only annoying because the service is generally poor.  Half the time they forget to ask (and the average person wouldn't know that it doesn't come automatically.  And if they do remember to ask, they then forget to bring it.  All in all, I still go there (mostly on Tuesdays for 1/2 priced sushi), but I do get annoyed by the service when I do.",

The first thing I asked was 'do you have any drinks with banana?' and she told me they did not. However, the first drink on the menu has banana in it so that's a good example of how our service went. I just don't think this place is worth it for the price. There's an excellent hibachi place at Monroeville Mall if you're really interested in trying some hibachi around Pittsburgh.",

I should have rejected it but instead I tried it. It was indeed old scrap, fishy tasting salmon. I'm still burping it now at 6:00am. Nasty!! Although the manager was helpful and tried by reducing my bill, I'm burping old fishy salmon flavor still, not what I wanted from a descent sushi dinner. I doubt I'll be going back. That Sushi chef should be fired!! You NEVER serve someone scrap, bad fish!!",

    "text": "Before i start my rant; Yokoso has great tasting sushi. I'll never stop going there for their sushi. But this happened and i was extremely displeased; my girlfriend made reservations for my birthday on Decemeber 21st and very specifically told them it was my birthday. They told her we would get 15 dollars off the check, they'd sing to me, and a free dessert would be provided. We sit down with our friends at the Hibachi table with a few of my friends and my girlfriend reminds the waitress that it's my birthday. The waitress forgot just about everything imaginable while serving. Then the hibachi chef came out and she didn't say a word the entire time. The hibachi chef only did the flaming onion trick. The hibachi chef gave three teenagers at the table that we didn't know more rice and veggies than any of us at the other corner; so our food portions were extremely small. Finally the waitress brings out the checks and bids us a good night. I call the manager over to advise him that it's my birthday and we were told we would be sang to, get 15 dollars off the check, and be provided a free dessert. The manager says: \"They probably forgot\". They probably forgot? The reservations were made with the notice that it was for a birthday party. Anyway, he corrected the check and overall it was a horrible horrible experience at Yokoso. And that hibachi chef should really find a new profession because her performance was unacceptable.",

    "text": "Yokoso was always a big hit in my family... reasonably priced hibachi food, abundant seating, convenient location.  So when a relative of mine was in town for the week and asked where we could get a group together to meet for dinner, I tossed Yokoso out there.  I talked it up: the portion sizes, the flavors, the shrimp sauce.  Now, mind you, at this point its probably been 2 years since I was last there, but how much could a restaurant really change in that time?  Answer: a lot.  Our party of 7 was seated at one of the back hibachi tables which was nice, they are a little more private than the tables in the middle of the restaurant and this made it easy to converse.  I didn't catch the name of our chef but he was a nice young gentleman who we made easy conversation with upon discovering that all of us were originally from the immediate area (Munhall, Baldwin, West Mifflin).  Our group ordered a variety of hibachi dinners, ranging from steak to salmon to chicken.   I'm not sure about the rest of my group, as I was too afraid to ask after recommending this place so highly, but my meal was flavorless.  Normally a healthy dip in shrimp sauce would salvage the various parts of my meal, but even THAT was flavorless.  My steak was a bit overcooked (I asked for medium, it was bordering medium well/well done), the rice was bland, and the veggies, though cooked perfectly, were plain, sauteed veggies.  In order to not tip off my dining companions I simply stated I was already full from picking at my meal as it was prepared (easy to do at a hibachi place, am I right?) and opted to take practically my entire meal home. Even my SO was disappointed upon heating the leftovers up later that night.  Maybe our group's conversation sidetracked the chef and he forgot to season our food properly, or maybe the quality of this place has really gone downhill since I was last there.  Whatever it was, I left still hungry and disappointed.  I know this place is locally owned and not part of a giant hibachi conglomerate, but it's hard to eat local when there's such a lack of flavor.  Three stars because its clean, has TONS of seating, and the waiter and chef were both extremely nice.",

    "text": "Terrible! My first and last visit here ever.   Let's start with the fact that it was my friend's birthday. It was my husband and me, my bff and her husband. Our main plan for the evening was to head to Sing-Sing. Due to getting a late start, we decided to stop here for dinner. It was Saturday night after 8pm so not very busy. We were seated outside quickly. Then we waited. And waited. A waitress passed our table 4 or 5 times without a word.  After at least five minutes, the hostess came outside and said that our waiter would be with us shortly, but she could get our drinks. It took her several minutes to bring out all of the drinks, since she didn't bring them all out together. And I still had to ask for my drink, because she forgot. There is some type of \"birthday special\" which inclues $15 off of a dinner, free cake, and some type of \"sparker\" and \"popper\" celebration. And a free gift....\"while supplies last\", whatever that means. This is good one week prior or after your actual birthday....pending valid ID. Although the menu also says not valid on Saturdays or holidays, my friend inquires anyways, since it is not at all busy. The hostess says that they will honor the birthday special and that the manager \"is really cool and will be fine with it\". Fine.   Waiter Joe finally arrives....dude is clueless. My friend's husband and I get hibachi dinners and my husband and friend get sushi platters. He asks what type of salad dressing we want....ginger or vinegar and oil. All four of us say vinegar and oil, all four come out with ginger. We have to ask the waiter several times for obvious things - Silverware and Napkins, More Drinks, To Take Plates Off Of The Table. You know, things that should come as common knowledge to wait staff.  When our meals come, he brings out one plate of sushi and seems confused, stating that they put all of the sushi on one plate.....uh no. We tell him there should be two plates. I mean, two people ordered two separate meals?! He fixes it and returns. Has no idea whose order goes to who....ugh.   At the end of the meal, Joe messes up our checks, putting things my friends ordered on our check. Again, we have to wait for this to get fixed. The worst part is that they automatically put 20% gratuity on the bill. I would not have left this dude a dollar if I had the choice. We waited several minutes to get our change. I actually had to go up to the bar and ask a bartender to find my waiter. Joe obviously cannot count either, he gave us $1.50 too much in change. I figured it could come out of his tip....  Here's the kicker....my friend gets none of this \"birthday special\"...no free cake, no $15 off, nothing. We inquire with Joe, who is still clueless. He has the manager, Jay, come out. My friend explains that, yes, we understand that it is Saturday, however the hostess said that it would be fine. Jay blabbers something about it being Saturday, and they try to exclude Saturdays to drum up business other, less busy days. We state, they are not busy at the moment. And this free cake thing means apparently, according to the manager, that if you bring your own cake, they won't charge you to plate it. His explanation for the ambiguous script on the menu? \"The Japanese can't explain things well\". Oh, okay.   He also says that the birthday special requires four meals to be purchased. Well, there is four of us, we say. He says, no....since they were on separate checks. Jay also says that this is \"up the manager's discretion\", but still will not give her the discount.  My friend says, \"Okay that's fine. We just won't be returning\". the manager's response is....\"Have a nice night\" and Walks Away!   I cannot even comment on the food....which was fine - not great not terrible - because there were so many other things to distract from the experience. This should have been a nice relaxing dinner with friends and it was blah blah blah.   I won't speak for the others (although I know their thoughts), but I feel cheated. One of the worst experiences at a restaurant ever. Will. Never. Ever. Ever. Return. You suck Yokoso!",

Here was my experience: I called for reservations a few hours ahead of time to have lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a small group of friends.  My interaction with the gentleman (if you can call him that!!) was already a preview to our bad experience.  He was rude - he never said hello or goodbye - literally hanging up the phone without saying anything and curtly took my information for the reservation.  Then when we showed up the greeters had NO CLUE what was going on. Keep in mind that the place was half empty.  5 out of 6 of our party was waiting in the lobby.  They asked that we wait for our whole group before being seated.  I get it - when restaurants are busy they don't want to waste time if a group is not complete.  But the place was empty!!!  Then, we asked if we could be seated and we would gladly start our lunch at a normal pace and our friend could just catch up - we shared we weren't even sure she was ordering a meal.  The manager (yes, MANAGER) curtly said that once we sit the \"clock starts\".  I'm sorry - but my Sunday afternoon lunch should NOT BE TIMED BY A STOPWATCH.   They absolutely refused to seat us.  They even went so far as to say that if we did choose to sit, even in the bar area (read: non-hibachi) our friend could join us but she would be NOT be able to order from the menu.  Needless to say, we immediately informed them that we would be leaving to have lunch elsewhere.",

You typically expect a Japanese steak house to be a classy slightly upscale environment & this was a very casual  Japanese steak house. I also thought their ginger dressing on their salad was a little too sour, unlike typical Japanese steak houses. Also their \"shrimp sauce\" or \"yum yum sauce\" which is usually my favorite sauce at other Japanese steak houses was terrible. It was a very thick, too much mayo, not enough spice sauce. I was pretty disappointed by that. I think if they upped the experience quality it would be worlds better.",

    "text": "Had high hopes for trying a new place. We love hibachi restaurants (kids dig the flames, Mom & Dad enjoy sushi).   Had a very, very bad experience here. The sushi was practically inedible. The maki was prepared so large that you couldn't fit a piece in your mouth ... which left you either trying to bite it in half, or cut it with a knife, which totally defeats the purpose. The sushi was placed on waaaayyyyy too much rice, leaving you to pluck the fish off of the huge ball of rice. Our server was friendly, but abandoned us for 10+ minutes at a time on more than one occasion (and even longer at the end of our meal, when everyone was way past ready to leave). For the kicker, when she brought the bill, an 18% gratuity was automatically added. When I asked about this, I was told that it's added for parties of four (4!) or more. I totally understand factoring in gratuities for large parties, but let me tell you ... adding it to a family of four is pure presumption.   I have seldom been more dissatisfied with a dining experience.",

We ventured into the deserted steakhouse and sat down by the bar around 2:00, expecting to catch a movie at 3:30.   The menu was definitely a little overwhelming at first, so we both ordered a drink to review each others' palates for sushi. My girlfriend ordered a banana split martini and was very delighted with her choice. I noticed that they had some different types of Japanese beer on tap. I ordered the Kirin and happened to love its light, refreshing taste.   After deciphering the menu, my lover ordered the paradise roll, which was an eight cut roll that included crab, avocado, and shrimp. I ordered the spicy tuna, which was also an eight roll that included yellow fin tuna, avocado, and crab. Both of our dishes were delicious.  In a fantasy sushi oasis, I couldn't picture sushi tasting any better. And for everything, we paid around $30.00. So, it was definitely an awesome way to catch a drink and a meal before a movie.",

I have a real problem with Sushi snobs, first most don't know what they're talking about, for example, at Yokoso one night I swear this really happened....a lady and her date ordered three rolls each, one of which was a dragon roll, a very spicy roll that basically masks the taste of the fish the roll is made from. Then complained that the yellowfin was not fresh. How did she know? She drowned her dragon roll with soy sauce, then piled on pickled ginger and wasabi, rendering her tastebuds useless.   If you want to taste the freshness of the sea, you eat sashimi, and just eat it with a few drops of soy sauce or none at all. Yokoso is one of the top sushi/teppanyaki spots in Pittsburgh.   Great feel inside, comfortable atmosphere, big bar area, nice selection of vodkas, great martini menu.   I'm not a huge fan of teppanyaki although I've had the salmon here and it's very good. I come here for sashimi and since going vegan, I come for the California rolls, and anything the chef comes up with. We are on a first name basis and he has made me vegan dragon rolls, which are pretty amazing. Great lunch specials and weekend evenings can be busy with a bit of a wait. Bar fills up quickly, so come early.",

We started off with an order of edamame (which looked and tasted like it was frozen, and then overcooked), and miso soup which was quite bland. For dinner we ordered the Red Dragon roll, the Three Rivers roll and the Polamalu roll. All three rolls were not impressive at all.  We left having the same bloated feeling that you get when eating cheap MSG-loaded Chinese food. The server took another long while to pick up our check when we were finished. We won't be coming here again.",

However, I wanted to give it one more chance and I decided to take my friends out for dinner to celebrate my graduation. We had two kids and a vegetarian in a party of 6 people. When I requested a separate hibachi table, they agreed to that. So, that was a good start.  Our waitress, Summer was extremely patient and very accommodating. She was able to handle all the special requirements we mentioned. And luckily, we also had a very accommodating and friendly chef Tommy. Both the kids had lots of fun and they said Yokoso is their favorite restaurant now. Apart from entertaining the kids, Tommy was very careful with the vegetarian option. He handled the vegetarian food first so that there is no mix up of food while he took care of the rest of the hibachi chicken order.   Coming to the food, I highly recommend the spring rolls. They are small in quantity, but very tasty. One hibachi chicken easily serves 2-3 people depending on your appetite. The fried rice is any regular fried rice.   Overall, the price is worth the experience! I recommend this place for large groups and kids above 5 years.",

The sushi was tasty and fresh not any complaints on taste. We gave had better in other cities. But for Pittsburgh it was good. One person at our table ordered a hibachi dinner and was pleased.   Now for the bad we made reservations for 6:45 on a Saturday for a party of 6. We arrive about 5 minutes late due to parking. The three girls at the hostess stand tell us they are waiting for a table to finish and they will push two together for us. We watch them clean a table where they told us we would be  At 7:10 we see two empty next to each other and ask when we would be seated. The hostess tells us they are waiting for the party at the next table over from the already two empty tables to finish but they have already closed out their check. The other party is still eating at 7:20. At 7:25 the table we are waiting for is brought their check. Finally at 7:30 we are seated.  So 45 minutes after our reservation time we get seated.  While the sushi was good the variety was lacking. They have 45 different rolls with the exact same ingredients tuna, shrimp and tempura.  Almost every roll had tempura in it whether it was tempura shrimp or crab or tempura flakes!  Definitely not pleased with the selection.",

The waitress was very responsive with drink orders and then with regular orders. She brought out our soups or salads and then ...chirp...nothing! Finally after 10 min or so a friendly female cook came out and did the normal hello welcome. We asked the cook why we had the wait and she said the \"men in the kitchen\" didn't want to wait on a table like ours!!!!!!! They were fighting on who was to cook and she finally said she would! And she did a wonderful job and we tipped her well!! Really? I know 14 women who WONT be coming back!!",

I really love the sushi at Yokoso and highly recommend the restaurant for that. The one time I went to hibachi there, I was completely unimpressed. The food was okay, but the show was terrible and the prices are higher than restaurants that do a better job. Skip the hibachi - get sushi!",

The positions are huge, the drinks can be a bit watered down at times but the sushi...the sushi is truly the reason I keep coming back. I've been to this place numerous times and haven't had a bad experience. My favorite is the hibachi shrimp and chicken and fried rice. I also must attempt to make the soup they offer as an appetizer because it's so good and it seems so simple but I know better! Yes hibachi is paying someone to play with your food while they cook it but it's so entertaining especially when you get the right chef.",

We were for fortunate enough to have Cliff both times and he is so personable and friendly... I cannot say enough good things about him.   The food here is so very good.  Other hibachi grills bring you a bowl of white rice and charge extra for fried rice.  Not here, everyone gets fried rice and it is cooked in front of you.  And the portions are great.   I cannot rate their sushi as I am not a fan of it, but the hibachi part is fantastic.  We will all be going back again and again. Yes, the Waterfront is busy, but there is always parking available.",

I'm not really one for Asian food, but I enjoy it once in a blue moon (or when my boyfriend begs me).   The night started out rough. After being seated, it took between 5-10 minutes for our server to come by. The very friendly manager noticed how long we were sitting and came by and took our drink orders. We ordered two wines and upon dropping them off he assured us they were on the house. This is good customer service! Our waitress was nice, but seemed to be new or in training.   Our food was great! Such a great deal! We got soup, salad, entrees and sides. So much food but I somehow finished it all! My chicken was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the dressing on the salad.   We didn't notice that the coupon technically wasn't valid during the time of our visit, but they still honored it anyways. I'm guessing they noticed how the beginning of our visit flopped so they stepped up to the plate! I want to thank the manager on duty (wish I would have got his name), because you made the night wonderful. The night could have been a huge disappointment, but stepping in to comp certain parts of the meal truly shows how you go above and beyond to make guests happy. We definitely will be returning!",

The inside is very nice; very clean and modern, it is a bit dark and also our booth seat was very broken in, I sunk down in my chair! Kinda weird but not a deal breaker of course..  I started off with the house salad w/ ginger dressing (so good!) and then ordered the Yum Yum roll and the Pink Lady roll for my main course.   The Yum Yum roll was delicious and I really liked the crunchy tempura flakes on top. Normally sushi isn't too crunchy and I liked the variety of taste and texture with this roll!  I have heard good things about the Pink Lady roll so I decided to give it a go. While the shredded crab on top was delicious, and the asparagus was yummy, I was not a huge fan of the large amount of cream cheese in the roll. I have never had cream cheese in sushi (I think the Philly style rolls have them) and it just didn't mingle with the other flavors in the roll. I probably would not get again but the presentation was fabulous!  I will ABSOLUTELY be back, especially on a Tuesday when their special rolls are 1/2 off! What a deal!",

Our appetizer of choice is: the Sampler Platter ( 12pcs - in those 12 you receive, beef gyozas, shrimp shumais, shrimp tempura, and spring rolls. Must try !!  I love the Chicken & Salmon Hibachi lunch or dinner. I have had the Chicken with Steak. I always choose the soup over the salad, but I do like the ginger dressing. I am not a huge iceberg lettuce fan. The show that the chefs display when cooking is entertaining. I like having the food prepared in front of me. I know what I am eating and how it was prepared.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have come to Yokoso a total of three times over the past 6 months, and each visit has displayed a tangible decrease in quality.  The service was great the first time we went, and the sushi platter we got was fresh and delicious.    The second time we went there we had to wait a while for our waitress to  take our order.  The restaurant wasn't busy so I have no idea where she was.  When we did make our order of the sushi/sashimi platter, the waitress asked us \"y'all do know that's raw fish right?\" I was absolutely dumbfounded. If your employees don't understand that raw fish is a totally normal staple of Japanese cuisine, and that this is common knowledge, they should not be your employees. Despite that, the food itself was good, if not spectacular.  Tonight we went back to give Yokoso another try. It was a busier night, so we forgave the waitress for being slow to greet us and take our order of the sashimi platter.  The server didn't say anything offensive, so that was a relief.  When we got to the salmon sashimi, we noticed that it was still frozen solid. We had saved the salmon for last since it is usually our favorite, so we didn't bother complaining.  Blatantly frozen fish is a massive no-no when it comes to sushi.  Our complaint wouldn't have changed anything if the restaurant was willing to serve frozen fish in the first place.    After our meal we were still a little hungry and didn't know why until we realized that our server did not bring us the soup and salad that was supposed to come with our meal.  We were not vigilant and the restaurant took advantage of that.  We also tried ordering the sea urchin sushi out of curiosity, and apparently the restaurant has never had sea urchin. Why put it on the menu then? Why would the waitress think telling us that would be a good idea?  TLDR; this restaurant features frozen fish, lackadaisical quality control, and can have some pretty bad service.  It can occasionally be good, but so can most other restaurants.",

The food is good, the server was attentive and always filled my water. The chef was personable and did an excellent job. They do just put fried rice on the grill, unlike other places I've been to that turn white rice into fried rice in front of you. On Tuesday's all the specialty sushi rolls are half price which is awesome. And they give you SO MUCH food. My friend and I split the chicken hibachi dinner and a sushi roll and it was still a ton of food. The picture I've attached is just half of a chicken hibachi dinner. The other is half a sushi roll.  It is a bit pricey. However, most hibachi places I've been to have been similarly priced. And they do give you a lot of food. Also, just a warning, they give tip suggestions on the bottom of the receipt. I did the math for a 20% tip and it was still lower than what they said a \"fair\" tip is. So do the math if you go, unless you think you had AMAZING service.",

    "text": "Tried this place years ago, and it was not good, so we didn't try it again until last night. Now with kids, our dining criteria has changed.   Called at 4:20 to ask about availability at 5:30 for 8 people (2 families). Was told reservations can't be made less than 2 hours in advance but that there wasn't a wait at the moment. I took the first reservation they would make as a backup plan (6:30-after their 2 hour requirement). Figured we'd go in and wait for a table, with worse case that we wait until 6:30 or decide to go elsewhere. Arrived at 5:40. After the hostess confirmed with other staff, we were told they had a table leaving and we'd be seated shortly. We waited 25 minutes. No big deal for the 5 adults, but rough for the hungry little kids. They had mistakenly given the table they had cleared to another walk in party. At 6:05 we were told it would be another 15 minutes. They continued to seat other parties of 8. At 6:30 we were told it would be a while longer.   Neither the hostess nor manager were well equipped to handle a busy restaurant.  After being told we would be sat shortly when we arrived, we waited 50 minutes before giving up.  We left with a sobbing four year old and ate elsewhere. If we had been told they couldn't sit us for roughly an hour, we would have sat at the non hibachi tables that go largely empty all night.  We're going to Ichiban tonight to make it up to the disappointed kids.",

Their rolls aren't pretty like most other sushi rolls, but - they are GOOD and they have a HUGE variety.  They have some of the normal \"specialty\" rolls that other places have as well - but be adventurous, try new things!  I have eaten there in the past for hibachi and it was always great.  But now...all I go for is sushi.  On tuesday nights.  Because 1/2 off.  My friend and I greedily split 6 rolls last night.  (we later determined we should get 5 - but have no regrets!  haha)  for $50.  Seriously - when can you get 6 sushi rolls for under $10 a roll - and these are specialty rolls with multiple types of fish in them!  Go check it out - if you are going for sushi - go Tuesdays.  Maybe I'll see you there :)",

The soup was the standard clear broth with a few mushroom slices. It was awful. The salad was actually quite tasty. We all had the steak and shrimp. In general, the flavor was just so-so. Much of the preparation was not done at the table. The fried rice was already prepared (except for the egg which was fried on the grill) and reheated on the grill. The shrimp and steaks were grilled tableside but the showmanship was lacking. I could have prepared the food with more flair.  Bottom line is that the flavor was just OK. Nothing special and not what other Japanese steakhouses offer.",

I know it's tepenyaki (sp?) and it's like a community to watch the chef cook, but we were a large group and the others felt weird and so did we. Regardless, the chef arrived and the show began. We started off with three sushi rolls and they were fantastic!! I ordered chicken and my guy ordered beef and shrimp. Loved the meal!!! The meats were cooked at the table as was the fried rice and veggies. With juggling the eggs and making a volcano with an onion,  the kids were fascinated! Everything was so very tasty and our waitress was friendly and helpful! Definitely would return and would do this all over again!! Kudos!",

I split the chicken hibachi with someone, our waitress brought us two separate salads and miso soups which I thought was pretty nice.

I asked if I could pay extra to add avocado to the top of the California roll. She said sure. He cut her off and said no. The idea of paying extra for a couple slices of avocado blew his mind. He refused to add avocado even for an upcharge. Most sushi places charge a couple bucks. How hard is it to add some avocado on top of the California roll? Luckily we were bar hopping so i left and found somewhere else to eat. Oh well...Maybe they should try to accommodate their guests.

    "text": "Came here for the 1/2 off sushi night on Tuesday. Although it was very crowded when we arrived, we didn't have to wait too long for a table.   I ordered the Plummy yummy cocktail which was good but a little strong for my taste. My friend however thought it was perfect; so if you like strong drinks, go for that one! Each person in my group ordered two rolls, which ended up being plenty of food. The rolls were huge! However, they were all pretty similar in terms of the fillings and toppings. Pretty much every roll on the menu was topped with a bunch of spicy crab. Now I like spicy crab, but it was way too much. They definitely skimped on the fish in my opinion as well. Maybe it's different when you order on the non half price nights, or maybe it's the two rolls I ordered, but overall I wasn't blown away by the sushi. I would still come back just because it was such a great deal, but only if I was craving some specialty rolls rather than actual fish.",

    "text": "We've eaten here a number of times. Mostly sushi but once at the teppanyaki tables (or hibachi to you hillbilly yinzfolk). Its always pretty good. But definitely not the best. We like it, though.  This time, I ordered something I've been wanting for awhile, a bowl of udon. We also got three rolls, an asparagus salad, some fried rice and a side of brocolli. The last time we were here, we sat down at the teppanyaki tables and ordered the brocolli for our 2 year old. We got pretty much a half pound of \"trees\" as she calls them and munched them down. Our order yesterday was only about a dozen pieces, which was a disappointment.  The udon was okay. I ordered the small, as the waitress said the large was very large. Props on the noodles...big and thick, chewy and firm. There was plenty of tofu inside and it was cooked in a way that gave it the texture and flavor of chicken. I got three large tempura prawns that were cooked perfectly. The broth was a little lackluster. And since I recently started having to watch my sodium, I had to leave the soy sauce alone. The soup was good but I probably wouldn't order it again.  The rolls were all good as usual. She got the California roll, the veggie roll and the Rock n Roll (shrimp, cream cheese, cucumber). Their sushi is priced pretty much the same as all the other sushi I've found in town. They have a couple sushi combos, and we've gotten these before, they're real deals. Individually picking the rolls can get pricy, though.  Finally, the salad. They have a green salad on the menu for $3.50. Its pretty small for that much money. Or you can get a few other salads for about $5.95. They double the size of the lettuce plus they put some asparagus or some other veggies on it. If you're gonna grab a salad, skip the $3.50 one and get the large size, its worth it.  The fried rice was pretty tasty. But for the two of us and the baby, it was overkill. Lots of egg and veggies in it.   Their teppanyaki lunches are priced great. You get plenty of food for $9-15 bucks. All in all, their prices are just a little higher than average for teppanyaki/sushi. Not as high as Nakama, plus the quality is better. Their lunch teppanyaki deals are real steals, though. Honestly, I like several other places more but their location makes it easy to do lunch after shopping.",

    "text": "I live in Philadelphia and I visited Yokoso this last Saturday for one of my best friends' birthday dinner with a group of about 12 people. The staff responsible for taking reservations messed up our friend's reservation which she made several days in advance and we were told to wait for a table (even though we had a scheduled limo coming to pick us up later). After about 20 minutes of waiting, we were finally seated and told that our server would be right with us. We waited another 15 minutes as servers rushed past us, completely oblivious to the fact that our large table hadn't been approached. Finally one of us ended up grabbing a passing waitress, Jasmine, who was extremely nice and offered to take our order herself. She was very accommodating and quickly took our drink and dinner orders, which is no simple task for a twelve top party. Our hibachi chef Cliff was also amazing, very funny and engaging. If it were not for Jasmine and Cliff, we certainly would have walked out and told everyone to stay away from Yokoso! We ended up making our limo reservation but it was unnecessarily stressful and aggravating. This review is getting 2 stars only because of Jasmine and Cliff's excellent service!",

I am not big into the Japanese Steakhouses but I have ate at Nakama in the past.    Enough about that, I ordered sushi (spicy tuna roll) which was very good.  The sushi prices are average and the quality is good.  For dinner I had the strip steak and lobster tail.  I ordered the steak medium and it came out more like well.  The chef was very entertaining but I wish he would have focused on how he was cooking my steak instead of flirting with the single girls at the table.  The lobster tail fit in the palm of my girls hand so I'd have to say it was on the smaller side but still at market price :)    Of course they load you up on soup, veg, and rice hoping you get full.  There was a party of 12 with us and everyone finished their meal except 2.  The waitress and staff were great, the drinks were strong if that counts for anything.  I guess I would go back for a special gathering but it wouldn't be me that choosing to go there.",

All I wanted was to order a snack from the sushi bar.  When we got there, 4 girls were up front in some kind of disarray.  We stood there for a few minutes; no one greeted us, told us they'd be with us soon... no acknowledgment at all.  The sushi bar was practically empty, so we asked loudly if you could seat yourself.  No one replied, so we started walking to the sushi bar.  A girl then came running after us, not to greet us, but to rudely state that the bar wasn't self seating and that there was a wait since the staff was behind.  We then promptly walked out.  I did call the manager, who was very apologetic, but I still won't go back.",

I know they always do the volcano and whatnot with the fire but this guy started off by setting two spatulas on fire and then doing some awesome tricks with them. Well it was cool until he threw one and injured our friend. Our chef threw a flaming spatula at our friend, he was ON FIRE. The worst part of all of this, besides the fact that his arms/hands and shirt were burnt, was the way the staff handled the situation. Our chef looked annoyed that this happened, as if it were somehow my friends fault. He didn't offer to help, hell, he didn't even pick up the spatula (that was still flaming) off the floor. After our shock and us checking to see if our friend was okay, the chef just looks at my friend and says \"Sorry about that, buddy\" What kind of a response is that????? The manager never came over to check if we were okay, no one offered apologies for what happened, it seemed as if no one even cared if we were okay. I was going to ask to speak with the manager but we decided not to cause a scene. However, I wanted to let people know that this happened because it may happen to you if you get lucky enough!!! I am utterly shocked at the lack of safety and care they showed for their patrons.   Won't be going back again and hoping that my friends burns heal properly.",

Yokoso is one of the only hibachi restaurants I know that has separate, isolated seating for big groups of people with a cooking area all to its self! This is nice because sometimes you want to enjoy hibachi without being seated with strangers. The ambiance is very nice- dimply lit with a funky vibe to it. The staff is team \"Yokoso\" so don't bring up Benihana! :-P It is nice to see staff that truly believe in their work and the quality of work that their company brings to the customer. I give this place 5 stars- it is clean, it is updated, and the food is always wonderful! Even if you had designated hibachi favorites in the 'Burgh, please give Yokoso a try! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "There are two reasons you should ever go to Yokoso: 1) You hate yourself, or 2) your relationship with someone is moving to fast and you want it to end. (take her here, she will hate you.)  I ate there last night, and it was so bad I was certain that I was on a hidden camera show.   To start, I ordered a roll of sushi for their half price Tuesday special. The roll came out 15 minutes later and it was warm. First time in my life that sushi was served warm (ingredients AND rice), as if it had been put in the microwave. It was disgusting. For the main course, I went with NY strip and shrimp. The shrimp was fine but the strip was chewy and wayyyy over cooked because the \"Chef\" was too busy being an entertainer. The rice was extremely buttery and gross, and the reason for the extra butter brings me to the \"Chef.\"   I have never had the opportunity to describe a chef as \"extremely offensive,\" until tonight. When he first arrived, he noticed all of our dirty dishes from soup/salads were still in front of us. He then starts saying how the waitresses and busboys are useless and how \"you get what you pay for, ya know?\" He then said how he would \"go in the back and get all the migrant workers to come clean up,\" but he \"doesn't speak Spanish\". It appears he thinks he is funny. He says how the migrant workers \"are only working here so they aren't sent back to Mexico,\" and follows it up with \"they aren't great cooks, but they are great at shoe repair.\" I sh*t you not. My wife who thankfully wasn't there, is a minority. I can take a joke or a remark (I've taken plenty) but its out of line when its from the person I chose to pay my hard earned money to for a nice dinner. I wanted to get up and leave as soon as he started talking, but I was with a group and didn't want to create a scene.   Because nobody takes away our dirty dishes (at a Hibachi table with 7 people,) the \"chef\" removes them from the table himself, handling dirty dishes and silverware with his bare hands, stacks them on the table behind him, dries his hands on his pants, then starts handling and cooking our meal! It was disgusting. He then shouts across the restaurant to our non-existent waitress, \"Hey babe, can you come help these people out.\"  After sitting with an empty beer glass in front of me for 20 minutes, my second drink finally arrives. It wouldn't do it justice to say the glass was cracked. It was straight up broken. There were such large cracks in the glass that chunks of it were missing. I show the \"chef,\" he calls over one of the \"useless waitresses\" (his words,) somehow the manager gets involved, and he (manager) starts calling out the waitress in the middle of the restaurant while she (the waitress) blames it on the bartenders.   (side note: throughout the night, the Manager was taking hits off of a can he placed out of sight at one of the many empty tables. Not certain if it was alcohol, but his slurred speech and total incompetency at his job point a certain direction.)  The \"Chef\" began by cooking the shrimp and placed it on our plates. Before taking my first bite of the meal, he says \"hurry up and eat that. I gave you extra and they come around and count the pieces. I don't want to get yelled at so hurry up and eat.\" That was definitely a first for me!  As the cooking progressed, the \"Chef\" was working on a pile of rice and veggies. He looked towards a pretty woman at a table who was clearly on a date and said \"tell me when it's too much\" and \"tell me when you're getting close\" as he squirted soy sauce on the rice. I don't know about you, but that's the imagery I want when someone is cooking my food in front of me. She asked for more butter (on the rice that we all share) and without asking the other 6 people at the table if they wanted an extra half stick of butter in their rice, he slaps more butter on the rice and says she can \"have it just the way she likes it.\" Still no sign of the TV show host that is going tell me it was all a joke.   I was so uncomfortable during the whole meal, I could barely look at the chef without cringing. Not surprisingly, the bill took 25 minutes to get and it was wrong. Not once, not twice, three times. The waitress needed three attempts to properly split a check for three people (AND ALL THREE OF US GOT THE SAME MEAL.) She needed help from the manager, who seemed annoyed that he had to do some sort of work in his restaurant. I reluctantly paid for my meal only because I wanted to get the h*ll out of that place. As our group left, the manager glared at us and said nothing.  There is zero chance I will ever go there again. Seriously, only go to Yokoso if you hate yourself.",

I've been here before and it's been fine, but, tonight was so bad we eventually asked them to box my food up instead of wait for it any longer.   The waiter was pretty much M.I.A. and never brought anything we asked for (water, chopsticks, etc.). He even brought my partner's sushi out before the salad and soup that should have come out in the 30 minutes we sat there waiting. After another 25 or so, we gave up on ever getting my (cooked) food and decided to leave.  Sadly, although we talked to a manager, he was far from helpful and just said the guy was in training. You'd think he would have helped, but he disappeared as well. I finally went in with a credit card and asked them to just box up what they had and charge me. This took another 15 minutes.  Insult to injury, the food was very disappointing.   Never again.",

    "text": "So the family and I were out and about thinking to hit another spot to grab a bite to eat before we possibly catch a movie. Well since the wait at the other place was considerable we decided to walk the mall and see what could be offered. Off we went and came across a place that looked nice and offered a favorite of ours SUSHI!!!!  As we walked in on the Friday night the air hummed with a vibrant busy spot where people were getting drinks, listening to the banter and pnash of hibachi cooks doing their most awesome, and an appealing sushi bar that was begging us to try their delectable fishy treats. The hosts at the front exceeded our expectations. They were obviously busy and very much hustling but promised a possible thirty minute wait and seat us at the next available table at the sushi bar. True to their words that's exactly what they did! Refreshing considering how often you are told \"it'll be thirty minutes\" only to wait forty five to an hour. Then the disappointment and hilarity begins.  After being seated we grabbed menus and began formulating our plan for sushi bliss. While we were planning our awesomeness a server passed us multiple time. No welcome, no glass of water, be right with you, NOTHING. So here I sit with my family tummy grumbling waiting for that moment to get some great sushi to grub on. So we waited, waited some more, waited some more still ... did I mention we waited... then after forty five minutes of additional waiting at our table, without even a glass of water, we received a text message from the other place and left to spend our money elsewhere. As a courtesy to the manager Eugene I called back to the Yokoso to inform him of our experience. Not to be rude or complain but to just let him know so he could possibly address it and save another family the discomfort. At first he seemed appreciative and wanted us to come back in to enjoy the restaurant. He asked me to call back the following morning to arrange a time and come experience Yokoso at it's best. So in turn I obliged and called back in the morning and the afternoon with no success getting a hold of Eugene. I left my name and number and yet each time I called he was on break and would call me back. Well I'm still waiting for that call back and have avoided posting about this experience because I wanted to be fair and afford them the opportunity to follow through with what that they said they would do. I can't speak to the quality of the food in fact it looked down right delectable but the lack of service to the point NO SERVICE ruined the desire to try them out. Not to mention the fact that when management fails to live up to their word and blows you off it tells me they don't value the customers because hey there will be another one walking down the sidewalk any minute. There in lies the problem though!   So this is me telling you the potential diner stay away save yourself the potential for a frustrating experience. Just skip it and go somewhere else where they value their customers and want you to come back!",

We went because my husband loves sushi. He ordered 4 different types of sushi and said it was \"decent\" but nothing great. I'm not a sushi fan so I ordered the twin salmon, which is the dinner portion of their lunch teriyaki salmon. It came with japanese soup (bland), a house salad (basically from a bag of iceberg lettuce from the grocery store with some Japanese dressing), and a plate of veggies, fried rice and 2 pieces of salmon. The plate of food tasted like something out of a frozen dinner but worse. The rice was cold, no flavor, salmon was overdone, hardly any teriyaki sauce and the veggies were the only thing I could manage to eat as they weren't that bad. Very upset since that plate cost $20 and wasn't worth a penny.  Also, they had us seat ourselves and the waitress took forever to come so the lady at the front took our order.",

Great place to take kids for a celebration, as the chef kept my son entertained. Service was average, nothing special. The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait and took our phone number so they could text us when a table was ready. We walked around the waterfront for about 15 minutes and we got a text that our table was ready. We returned to the restaurant and the hostess (not the sharpest tool in the shed) said, \"Did you get a message?\" ..um, yes? Then she had us wait for another 10 minutes while they cleaned a table. Restaurant was packed at 5:30 on a Saturday. Chef said it's their busiest day of the week. I was on sensory overload the whole time, as it was super loud. Other than that, the dining experience was good, and I definitely recommend.",

The shrimp was delectable. So good. We also had enough food left over to take home for 2 more meals, so it is very worth the price.  The reasons for 2 stars less are the service and atmosphere. The atmosphere seemed kind of tense - the employees, especially from the kitchen, seemed to be exhausted and overworked. I witnessed an argument between 2 employees right next to our table that seemed to be, more than anything, fueled by the exhaustion and the tense atmosphere. Also, it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to bring our drinks and food orders. She later apologized, saying that she had to close out 7 separate checks, adding to the feeling that everyone was stretched too thin. Maybe it was just a bad night, but it took a little away from the dinner.  Overall, I'd come back for the food. I'm just hoping for a nice atmosphere the next time, where the employees seem more content.",

    "text": "Poor service and not that clean. My wife and I stopped in at about a 9:45 PM on a Friday night. It readily became apparent that the staff was more interested in preparing to close for the evening than it was in serving customers still coming in. Our waitress was pretty much MIA. We had a flag down other waitresses to get our waitress when we needed something. It took quite a bit of time to get our meal and when we got it the vegetables were cold. The food wasn't bad but this is definitely a case of poor service killing the meal.   The amount of food that was on the floor under our booth was pretty gross. There was rice, broccoli and at least one piece of shrimp on the ground directly underneath of our table. I also had to wipe down my seat before sitting down because of all the rice that was left there. Apparently on top of being too busy to give halfway decent service they were also too busy to make the restaurant halfway presentable. When leaving our waitress didn't even bother to ask how our meal was and it was obvious she didn't care. I definitely won't go back and I left there feeling like the place was kind of ghetto.",

    "text": "Consistently good selection and fresh fish with a generous side of mediocre service.  Nice bar list including Sapporo on tap, spoiled by waiting at the bar to pay the check with the bar left fully unattended on Saturday night for 10-15 minutes.  They had alot of fun local house rolls like a Pitt Panther Roll, Steel City Roll, 3 Rivers, Crosby Roll, Polamalu Roll, and Pirate Roll.  When I asked the waiter what their favorite specialty house roll was they recommended the \"California Roll\".  Whoah, slow down wild man!  I don't know if my tastes are that adventurous!  We ordered the Sashimi Platter and Spicy Tuna Tartare which were very fresh and well done when they arrived.  There was a long wait and they initially forgot the Tuna.  If the service was as good as the sushi I'd give it 5 stars, but as it is, you'll come for the food, and leave for the service.",

    "text": "I have been to many sushi restaurants, cheap to fancy. But at Yokoso, sushi is definitely not their strong point. The sushi pieces were mouthfuls of mostly rice, that too little dry . I ordered a Rainbow Roll and The Pitt Roll. Not good. The prices are OK not very reasonable. I dont know about the other items on the menu, but sushi was meh! Only go here if you are absolutely craving for one. But the service was good and prompt.",

    "text": "Everything seemed OK until hair was discovered in my fried rice. The manager (late 20s black male, short hair) offered to recook the rice. I declined because my appetite was already negated, and I asked him how did I know that it wouldn't happen again? He had no answer other than that he would remove it from the check (which he did). Perhaps if he spent less time outside smoking (he reeked of cigarette smoke when he came to the table) or watching the steelers game and more time watching the cooks/waitstaff, this might have been avoided. There's another review on here from another person that found hair in their food. We DEFINITELY won't be back.",

The only part of the meal that was extraordinary was the volcano rolls that we had were truly fantastic.  Good location in the waterfront.  Like any habachi place, come with a group and you'll have a much better time than date night.  We had a group of 10 for my moms birthday and had a blast.",

    "text": "Yeah, it's not the best sushi in the world, but the price is right.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken, salad, California Roll, and Diet Coke all for under 20 bucks, plus had leftovers for lunch the next day.  Our server was very attentive, esp with keeping my Diet Coke always full.  Numerous other staff stopped by our table throughout our time there; not sure if the staff was mgmt. as they did not identify themselves.  So many stopped by during our meal that it was comical....not sure if that is the standard or Yokoso was overstaffed that day and the employees were looking for something to do :)  There aren't a tremendous amount of fine dining options at the Waterfront, and most of the restaurants are national chains .  I don't *think* Yokoso is a chain after a Google search, but I'm not positive.  You could def do worse at the Waterfront - overall, a pleasant experience at a reasonable price point.",

We had two chefs (we had two tables next to each other in their own alcove.  All of our party had a great time, the chefs were very good and funny and the portions were properly cooked and very generous.  The wait staff was also very good.  The restaurant itself was clean, nice and properly lit.  Could not ask for anything more.",
