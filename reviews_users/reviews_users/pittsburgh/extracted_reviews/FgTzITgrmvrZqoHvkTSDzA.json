    "text": "I was incredibly disappointed with the service that I received in the afternoon Sunday, July 27.  I made reservations via an online app, and they were relatively prompt sitting us.  A slight annoyance was that they never removed my name from their list so the app kept texting me that my table was ready.  I had to go back to the hostess to change this.  Next, I was a bit annoyed that it took our server too long to greet us.  Yes they were \"busy\" but in my section there were a lot of empty tables.  My boyfriend and I order immediately when he greets us.  It's ~3 PM  We decide to be simple to get in and out (or so we thought).  I ordered the sliders and fries with a Blue Moon; my boyfriend ordered a turkey burger and a side of fries.  My beer came 5 minutes later (which is fine).  20 minutes come around and I ask the waiter to check on the food.  My fear is another table getting my food (sliders and burgers are common).  It's going on 3:30 PM.  I'm beginning to get restless and not to mention hungry.  The server then brings on the excuses.  \"We just got a large influx of people so we're a bit swamped\".  He tells me the manager will bring the food out...  10 minutes later (yep, a total of 45 minutes after we ordered) the manager (Kristopher Brown) comes out with the food.  All that he did was apologize and give me the same excuse that they're just busy.  Other people that came in before us were in and out.  He offered NOTHING to us. No discount, no complimentary anything.  We felt like we didn't matter at all and that management didn't care about us.  After that I didn't have the time to even argue.  I guess I know where I stand.  I was greatly disappointed in the service and ESPECIALLY Management.",

Prices are high and menu appears to be trying to be high end, which is weird when the bus' name is on the door. Actually walked to the restaurant from the Hyatt Place hotel specifically to watch the Rangers game and grab a bite to eat unfortunately after five minutes was not able to get the waitresses to identify which TV could be change to the game. As it was the bottom of the eighth inning I chose just to watch the ending via the mlb app I have on my phone.",

I can't comment on the interior restaurant because we opted for an outside table. Maybe that's good, maybe that's bad, but either way I was pleased.  The drink list, as well as the menu, was more extensive and varied than I first assumed, with decent selections of draft beers and mixed drinks. I decided on the Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries, which were both very good. For dessert: Turtle cheesecake...excellent!   As far as the service, the waiter was very personable and friendly throughout the meal even though he was very busy with numerous tables. Prices were surprisingly reasonable as well.  Spending a warm, beautiful evening outside, eating/drinking on the North Shore and admiring the Point and city skyline sunset was a great way to end the day.",

    "text": "Came into town for the Monday night game and were else would you go for some pre- game, but to the Jerome Bettiss' Grille. Read some of the earlier reviews and got kind of nervous.  However all I can say to that is, it's a sports bar, they serve beer and it's awesome. Came in a few hours before the game hoping it would be packed and it was, Steeler nation was in the house. Lot of T.Vs to watch and a nice gated outdoor area to hang out it. Not a better place to get warmed up, ramped up, and ready for Heinz field!  Beer is cold and food is exactly what I want out of a sports bar.  Had the Bulgogi and some wings for some dinner and they were both delicious.  Bulgogi came in a flour tortilla with a wasabi slaw and a spicy Asian chili sauce.  Wings came in orders of 9, 18, and 36, so I went with 18 with the hot garlic parm sauce. With all those wings I had to drink plenty of beer to wash them down with.  The bar had my favorite on draft magic hat #9 and all six were just as good. Each one even got a little better.   Jerome Bettis Grille was exactly what I was looking for, great atmosphere, great people and great Service.  If you're looking for a fine dining experience, a quiet place to be with your friends, and a lame night probably not the place for you. If you want to rock out with some great Steelers fans then this is the place for you.",

My salad was tasty and everyone else enjoyed their entrees - but when I thought back about it, my salad was missing two of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. But hey, I was tipsy and didn't miss them while I was eating. They were out of carrot cake (basically the reason we came). We got the brownie instead and it was pretty dry. I could have made better out of a box.   But, overall it's a fun place with good food and big portions!",

It's right next to the Steeler stadium, so the crowd seems to be mostly hotel guests from the surrounding blocks or bar regulars. The menu is pretty vast, but my burger was great. Most of the sandwich options my colleagues ordered were well received.   I made the mistake of ordering some shrimp/cheese wonton as an appetizer and that really missed the mark. But it seems like this place will have a beer, cocktail, and dish for everyone.",

    "text": "Coming down from Western NY for a Monday Pirates game vs. the Braves, who I rarely get to see, my brother and I wanted to make a day of it. After doing some research of the sports bar/grills that populate the area around PNC Park and Heinz Field, Jerome Bettis' seemed like our best bet, though no place had crazy outstanding reviews. We'll let it slide that the Steelers beat our Bills just two days before!  Entering at around 3:30pm after a 3 hour drive we were seated quickly at a hi-top table in the bar. Lots of TV and we liked that they had the TVs \"pre-labled\" with which games would be showing on them in the evening. I had a nice view out the patio at the WWII memorial as well as the Fountain across the river. It was already pretty bustling with Pirates fans and a few of our fellow friends from Braves Country.  Toi was our waitress and was very pleasant and quick with service, even if my brother's NY Drivers License confused her when looking for his birthday :).  My brother and I both started with draft beers. They have large glasses for the $7.50 range and a wide selection of PA local and general favorites on draft.   I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Biscuit \"Sliders\" and my brother got the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with the sauce on the side. Our food came out very quickly and was freshly made and piping hot. I sort of had low expectations for biscuits made at a sports bar, but I have to say I was very impressed. They were warm, flaky, and held together even with the BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was moist and tender and the BBQ sauce which was layered on top was nothing out of this world, but still very tangy and a good compliment. Not too spicy or salty. There were lightly battered/fried thin onion \"strings\" on it. Those were a little tough. Might be better to have them chopped because they were hard to bite through. With a small side of basic fries, it was a filling meal.   My brother chowed down on the cheeseburger, dipping it in the BBQ sauce. He ordered it medium rare and said it was perfectly done. Good amount of toppings, large overall burger, and I could see the bacon sticking out of every side. Had a higher end, large soft bakery roll. He ate every little bit while hardly talking so I would consider that a success.  Prices for downtown/near stadium food are to be expected. It was $13 for my two biscuit sliders and $12 for the burger. I think mine was a little over priced for the size, but it was still good. I did like that they had quite a few fancier salads and vegetarian items. I always take note since my mom is a vegetarian and it is rare sports bar place has these, so I would recommend it here if you have a veggie eater in your group.  The bathrooms were oddly weird... my brother went when we got there and said it was \"like a club\". I went when we left and it was SO dark in there. I had to use my phone's flashlight app to find something in my purse. Very strange considering the rest of the restaurant is not like that.",

We found ourselves in the area after a visit to the Science Center and decided to give it a try.  We were told there world be a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being more like 15 or 20.  Once seated, I noticed the large number of TVs and how they were labeled with which hockey games they were showing.  Being from Buffalo and a huge Sabres fan, I was delighted when they changed one of the TVs to show my game.   The menu ranges from typical bar food to fairly gourmet selections.  Despite a grilled chicken option sounding very tasty, I opted for something that I highly doubt I can find anywhere else - the deep fried cheeseburger.  Am I glad I tried it?  Yes.  Would I ever have it again?  No.  It had a tempura type batter on it and it was HUGE.  Certainly a fork and knife sort of burger.  It was tasty and they burger was moist without the trimmings being soggy.  But it is very filling.    And apparently the men's bathroom has a mirror that you can see out to the bar so you don't miss any of the game action. Strange, but I guess just something else that makes Bettis's memorable.  Will I go back to Berttis's?  Sure.  I'll just be sensible and order the chicken.",

We placed our orders nothing that wasn't on the menu. My soup arrived without a spoon. The rolled napkins only have knives and forks, I am not sure what that's all about. I had to wait several minutes for the spoon but the soup was excellent. I ordered shrimp tacos. They arrived, I tasted a shrimp it was good. I looked deeper into the taco and there was dry lettuce ( not even good lettuce) and shrimp. The description mentioned a slaw and a dressing. My three tacos were missing those items.  I questioned the waiter and after a good 7-10 20 minutes the waiter returned with the dressing. I returned the entire dish of dry shrimp tacos.

Was visiting from out of town and thought it would be nice to visit the north shore for the Game since I've never been there before.   I have been in the food service Industry and have never seen such poorly trained Manager or Host staff. Went there on game day and put my name on the list.  After waiting for 1.5hrs I asked hostess where my name was on the list and they said they called my cell phone and i didn't answer.  I showed the hostess my cell phone log and showed her that I had NOT missed any calls, and NO calls from any numbers in PGH.  She insisted she called me and there was nothing more she could do.    There was a guy standing there and I asked him if I could talk to a manager and he said he would get one.  He left and returned and said there weren't any managers present and he couldn't find one.  BTW, while I was standing there a girl came up and said she had two missed call and showed them her phone log and they told her we gave your table away for not answering.    I asked the gentleman his name and he refused to give it to me, and said I was out of luck on getting a seat.  I asked for the manager again and voices started to elevate and he asked me to step outside so we could settle it the  old fashioned way with a fight...    Now I'm asking him, are you really threatening me because you don't want to find your manager???     Fortunately there was a patron behind me who heard the whole thing, asked if I needed a manager and left and returned in less than a minute with one.   The manager did not seem concerned that her server just threatened me and wanted to go outside, nor did she seem concerned over how the other hostesses said they called me when I didn't have any missed calls and perfectly good cell signal.  Her only comment to me was it was game day and it happens.   I have worked major Events my whole life and know the planning associated with it and can relate, but again making this statement is not fixing the problem or addressing the issue with the staff.   Fortunately as we were going through these issues another gentleman walked by and said I have your seat follow me.   Not sure why the manager or all the other staff are so poorly trained.   If They are going to use cell phones as the only source to commiunicate a seating they need to be prepared to address issues when they are wrong and accidentally cross a name off The list without contacting them.  The waiter we had was excellent and food was excellent, but this incident soured the whole experience",

Dayna was extremely responsive and made sure everything was exactly the way I had envisioned it to be. The hosts and waiters were also fantastic and made sure everyone was well taken care of. We couldn't have asked for a more accommodating venue or better service for the party. We will continue to be regular customer and recommend Bettis' to others in the future!",

He hit home run on all suggestions to our family from the \"game day\" drink, pan fried chicken, street tacos to beer selection. We ended up here because another \"burger\" place close by closed their kitchen early. So glad we ended up here instead. Ask for George, if he's there,  all around great guy who represents JBG36 very well!  My kids, teenagers, even mentioned that they wish other people enjoyed their jobs like George seemed to. When teen age boys notice that, it's something special",

Deciding that we didn't really want drinks in a small plastic cup decided to wait and order from our table. Stood there a bit, tables were available, and others were being seated. The hostess forgot about us.   We were finally seated and sat at our table for 15 minutes, never spoke to a server, no water, nothing. We walked out.    Disappointed.",

Then I waited...and waited. When my burger finally arrived I was too hungry to snap a pic but it was a bit disappointing. While I was glad it wasn't just an average turkey burger patty it was a bit dry and could have used a tad bit more seasoning. The tater tots were good but a little on the salty side.   I was waiting to be blown away and it just didn't happen. But I'm not giving up on this place. I'd give them another try maybe when they aren't so busy (there were three events going on the night I went) and see if they can make me a fan.",

    "text": "We used to enjoy this restaurant as we are season ticket holders to the Pirates and attend quite a few Steeler games also.  We have eaten here 30+ times and always had good experiences until recently.  We ate there about 2 months ago and had a extremely rude waiter who was apparently not happy that we came to the restaurant with a 2 year old and a 5 year old.  It started when we asked for a grilled cheese for our son which is not on their children's menu.  Although grilled cheese is not on the children's menu, there is a \"grown up grilled cheese\" on the main menu, and we had previously ordered a simple grilled cheese with American cheese on several occasions in the past for our picky 5 year old son without a problem.  The waiter immediately let us know that we could not order this as it was not on the kids menu.  Okay, we did not complain and just moved on and ordered an alternative item.  I ordered a beer that was a Sam Adam's IPA and received what was obviously a Sam Adam's ale or seasonal.  I tried to politely explain to the server that I had received the wrong beer and he was not receptive.  I ordered a second beer attempting to be very specific and again was given the same incorrect beer.  At this point point I realized I was not going to get the correct order and gave up and moved on.  At the end of the meal we were given the bill.  I asked if we were going to be offered dessert.  The server looked at the kids as if to say \"did they deserve dessert\".  At that point I just paid the bill.  When the server returned and in a condescending manner asked how everything was I simply said \"the food was good as always but the service is usually better\".  At that point we left and I did not make a scene.  I am a doctor and my wife is a lawyer and we eat a number of restaurants through business and with our children.  We are very ethical and understanding people.  This was an obvious attempt by a service employee to \"put us in our place\".  Maybe it was the kids being loud but I have never been treated like this in my life at anywhere from McDonalds to Ruth's Chris.   We have returned to Jerome Bettis on a few occasions and it now seems that the server remembers us and has stalked our table in an attempt to make us feel awkward.  Well it is very awkward!  We finally attempted to bring our concern to the manager who confronted the employee in question.  Obviously the employee denied this.  At this point we will not return to Jerome Bettis Grille.  This is my first review of anything in general on a public forum but I feel so offended by our treatment at this restaurant that I feel the need to voice this review.  There are plenty of good places to eat on the north shore.  Avoid Jerome Bettis Grille 36.",

Most popular item on the menu seems to be the deep fried Italian hoagies, deep fried cheeseburgers and meatball sandwich. No, the don't deep fry the salads here, but even they aren't typically healthy due to the fact they use about a hall cup of dressing per dinner salad, and according to Pittsburgh rules, about a half pound of fries depending on your salad. The 36 oz steak is huge and looks like it would be hard to finish along with the sides and salad that comes with that meal.   Daily drink specials and happy hour priced apps.

The flatbread was everything I wanted it to be - a great balance of the potato, cheese, and onion, nothing overly heavy. And the mac and cheese... a friend had mandated I get it, and I originally was going to order the entree, but she stopped me in my tracks and said the side was enough. It WAS. The richest, most decadent mac and cheese I think I've ever had! So needless to say, I left about $16 lighter and 100 lbs heavier.",

    "text": "Was enjoying a summer day, listening to an outdoor concert at stage AE and decided to move over and sit outside of JBG and have some cocktails and appetizers with a friend. The service was wonderful, very polite host and our server was very helpful and fun. The food for the price is where I had issues. I had 3 beers (draft selection was pretty decent) but at 8$ a pop for each one (all different) was a bit much.  Food wise: started with the spinach artichoke dip...a little too creamy, but still good.  Continued on with the short rib tacos which were maybe the worse tacos of my life. cold tortilla, little meat, and dry slaw mix. nothing at all interesting and certainly not worth the like 13$. I had to put the leftover spinach artichoke dip on top to give it any moisture. still only finished 1.   So, location is great...food is meh...prices are as high, but service was wonderful. Won't be going back though",

I'm always a bit impressed when a place can offer me SAFE fries.  They do have a designated gluten free menu... so you just have to ask.  I'm pretty sure everything even comes out on specially shaped plates to fully differentiate gluten from gluten free items.   Overall its a nice place to catch a game, chat with a few buddies, and eat +/- drink.  Parking might be a challenge if its a game night... but there are something like 3 lots within 2-3 blocks that you can pay a rather low rate for the night.",

The men's restroom are really cool it's a one sided mirror where you can look over the whole bar. The atmosphere especially while watching the games was electric. Would really recommend this place for a lunch break or even a night out",

After waiting over an hour we were told that they were cleaning a table. Meanwhile there was a large empty table. Another large party that was standing next to us were given that table even though their yelp app said no parties ahead of us. We asked again and were finally seated. When the waitress came to take our order we were told it would take 45 minutes to get our food. At that time we said \"see you later!\"",

A mojito should be refreshing and crisp, not flat and tasting like cheap rum. I would never recommend this place for drinks, maybe the food is alright but I didn't stay long enough to find out.",

But Pittsburgh loves its sport teams and I can respect that.  When you first walk into the restaurant you notice all the black and gold and TVs.  There are flat panel HDTVs everywhere you turn, which are tuned into many different sports so you won't miss anything.  As I was waiting for 1.5 hours I saw a waitress carry around a nice piece of steak.  It looked so delicious.  So I got it.  It was satisfying.    I also recommend the \"house made bread pudding with sweet flakey croissants, oatmeal, and raisins\" for dessert.  It is scrumptious.    I would recommend taking \"The BUS\" to this grill because parking in the lot across the street costs money.",

    "text": "Zero stars. We came here for dinner last Thursday. There were four of us and there was no wait. The waitress tried to seat us at a table with only three chairs, without finding us a fourth chair. I guess one person was supposed to sit on the floor. Then we asked to move to another table, and instead of saying that was ok, she responded that would be a different server. I am not sure why we cared, except our service turned out to be terrible.  Maybe she was trying to save us from that, but I highly doubt she was thinking of us. It took us forever to get our food, and the server was not friendly at all. I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The \"soup\" came in a container the size of a side salad dressing. I was expecting an actual bowl of soup. The sandwich and salad dressing/soup were cold. I'm not sure if we were being punished for moving tables, or if it was always that bad. There are way better places to eat in Pittsburgh. Don't waste your hard earned money here.  This place is living off a name only. It's a tourist trap.  Bad food, even worse service.",

She told us 15 mins. We waited over an hr. Because they forgot us. The waiter ended up being great and the food was as well but being forgotten and she did tell us she forgot. So fast forward 1 yr. We come again for a baseball game and this time bring our son. We did get right in, the lady says our server will be right over to wash down our table. So we waited and waited. A guy comes over and and takes our drink order. 1 of us ordered soda 1 ordered water and 1 ordered a beer. Guy comes out with 2 drinks and says beer will be right out. 1/2 hr later the beer comes out. Mind you it wasnt busy and to boot he wasnt our server. I was just about to walk out when the beer arrived. The waitress took our order which this poor new girl got thrown our table bc the other waitress left early. It left us with no waitress. So this poor nee waitress came and took our order. Over a half hr to get our food. So food comes my husband and sons food was warming. Mine was fricken cold. I truly mean cold. I was fuming because of all the time we sat and wasted. The suoervisor/cook/ waittess( way to much for 1 person) came to talk to us. She ended up taking care of our whole bill. I normally do post reviews however the supervisor told me to. Can you believe that. She said that if I were to call the mgrs would just give me the run around.  Want to mention that as we were sitting there there was a very rowdy and horrible and I mean horrible value group behind us. No one bothered to say anything to that group. So here I am. I will never go back. 2 times to shitty experiences. Jerome Bettis shoukd be more aware of this because his business will sink.",

Then the waitress came out and said sorry as we were exiting. This isn't the first time we have had slow service there. They acted like they don't want anything to do with a party over 4. They easily could have made 300+ on our group because we were drinking + eating and it was for a friends birthday, yet they just didn't care. Will never go back again.",

Now comes insulate to the bucket list the person in charge thought we came for a free meal and gave me a tour of a private room and told me Saturday was his last day and it was all he could offer me and my guess and have a nice day.

I get it things break, you can't always control that though it didn't look like anyone was in a hurry to fix it or apologetic about it.  The men's room was filthy.  There was no soap and no indication there had been soap present in recent history.  If they can't take care of the restrooms, what else aren't they taking care of?  I told the hostess about it who gave me a \"who cares?\" look.  An hour later after a second visit to the men's room it still had not been refilled.  The remainder of the restaurant didn't look much cleaner.  Our group had simple orders of burgers and salads.  It took over an hour for the order to come out.  When it did finally come, the burgers were cold and looked like they had sat under the heat lamp for a while because the cheese had taken on a crusty look.  Also, the lettuce and tomato absent even thought the waitress had asked us specifically if we wanted that included.  We had to ask for silverware.  It just seems like no one in the place seems to care or have an interest in providing good service.  The whole place made me long for the more sanitary conditions of PNC Park.  This place is past its prime, go somewhere else.",

One item ordered were wings which came with celery sticks, wings were ok but fatty, celery sticks were white and limp with one of them being blackened and looking like dirt on it. Mentioned to bartender but just received a shrug. Also ordered burger with sweet potato fries...fries were chewy. Men's and women's restrooms dirty with sticky floors. Surprised Jerome keeps his name on a place like this. The location is excellent beside the Allegheny River and in middle of a lot of activity but that's about the only positive in my opinion. Have been there about 4 times over the years and never been pleased.",

    "text": "I came here the Steeler game on Monday night with two of my friends. The space is nice and roomy with a lot of seating. My friends and i found a table at the bar area and sat there. I will start by saying two things: 1) our waiter came right over and asked for our drink orders (i like that) and 2) the bar area was a little busy, not definitely not completely full. He brought us back our drinks and then went on to another table. He wanted to put an app in, but our waiter never came back. Finally when he did, he brought another guy over and said that since they were so busy (they weren't) that they would both be helping us out tonight. A while later, the original waiter comes back over and says \"he's taking care of you now, right? Okay good.\" Then ran away as fast as he came. At this time we were still waiting to put our appetizer order in. Finally about a half hour later, the second guy comes over and asks if we needed anything. (My water was empty). At that time, we put in our appetizer order, some more drink orders, and i asked for more water, because we didn't know when he'd be back. He came back about 10 minutes later with our appetizer and then about 10 minutes after that when our drink orders. A while later he came back to take our dinner orders. Two of us got salads and the third person for a turkey burger. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive and was brought out by someone else. A half hour after our food came out, our waiter came back and was very anxious to give us our check. He did not check to see how our food was nor did he refill our drinks. Once he dropped off the checks, he was very quick to take our checks and bring them back. We stayed until the end of the game and he didn't come back to check on us once we cashed out. He didn't offer any more water or anything.   On top of that, the food was nothing exciting. I gave this place 2 stars because the atmosphere and warm and inviting and it is a great place to watch a game. But, i probably won't be back.",

Our waitress was terrible!   We ordered drinks and one app. and stated that we would be ordering more apps. once we had our drinks.  The drinks took a little bit and our waitress disappeared before we could order more apps.  Then she did stop by and looked at us and said, Oh Yea you ordered an app.  She ran and picked up our app. and started to run away! Ha!  We were able to get her attention and did order more apps.   During all of this a few more people showed up at our table and not service. Those apps. did show up pretty soon and then she did refill some drinks and take the other drink orders.  By this time the bar area was about half full. Then no waitress, no cleaning up of all the plates and apps that were on our table, no drink refills.  We put all of the dirty plates on a table nearby.  Those were picked up and finally we were asked if we wanted drink refills.  Then we asked for the check.  She forgot that and we had to ask again about 20 minutes later. We shared a few apps and a steak salad.  The steak salad was good, the Chips & Queso was OK, you do get a fair amount of Queso and Salsa but not enough chips.  The flatbread and quesadilla were also OK.",

    "text": "Upon our first trip to Jerome Bettis' Grille 36 about three weeks ago, we left extremely disappointed. When we put in our name, the hostesses gave us no idea of how long the wait would be, but it ended up being over an hour. This wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't have to watch half the tables sit there empty, due to lack of staff. When we were finally seated, we ordered immediately. The waitress told us the food would probably take awhile. Indeed, it took about 45 minutes to finally see our entrees. The experience became extremely poor at this point, as one of the entrees was wrong. We ordered boneless wings, but received a chicken sandwich. The waitress even asked which dipping sauces we wanted upon ordering, not what we wanted on a sandwich, so the order was placed correctly by us.  When we pointed it out to the waitress, she had the nerve to tell us we put in the order incorrectly. To tell the customer they're the ones in the wrong is poor practice, especially when it's not their fault. We told her that we wanted boneless wings, so I'm not sure why she'd say it was our fault that the order didn't come out that way. Finally, she told us she'd put in an order of boneless wings for us. We then told her we had no silverware or napkins. The rest of our party that did have food had to stare at our entrees and wait for utensils to be brought over. It took the waitress ten minutes, as she went around chatting with other tables. We ended up asking another employee for the silverware, so we could eat before the food was completely cold. When the waitress finally did come back, she came with cocktail napkins and no silverware. The person in our party waiting for the wings finally got to eat as we were signing the bill. After signing, we were given the receipt of another party. Although they did charge us for the correct order, I ended up having to leave with no receipt, as the waitress was nowhere to be found. The next day, I sent an email explaining all of this, in hopes that management would work on training their employees to be kinder and more attentive. I received no response. It appears they don't place very much importance on customer service. We won't be returning.",

Our table was very sticky, which was a big turn off, but the dining area was clean and the food and service made up for the sticky table. The four of us had a pierogi flatbread, spinach and artichoke dip, kids mac and cheese with fruit, and a barnyard burger.  The portions were huge, we could have shared a couple items.  The kids mac was delicious, everyone tried it and the kid still had more than he could eat.  First, I have to say that I was impressed that every kids meal came with one side.  Most places only certain items get a side, and typically the macaroni and cheese is not one of those items.  The fruit cup wowed me, actual fresh fruit!  Watermelon, cantaloupe, grapes, and blueberries- a 'cup of soup' size bowl.  The spinach and artichoke dip was a generous portion with both tortilla chips and pita bread slices.  The teenager barely put a dent in it but she was busy picking off of everyone else's plate!  The pierogi flatbread was so delicious, and a unique combination.  Just the right amount of food to feel very full but not overly stuffed.  The barnyard burger was a great burger and when given a choice of fries or tots, the hubby couldn't decide so he got both.  He definitely liked the tots better, but didn't get to eat many between the two kids!  This is a great place to go and we will be back!",

Looking at the menu, there was lots to pick from, but in the past, we've only really had satisfactory experiences with the food. For this reason, we decided to not order food but stick with drinks.   We were seated outside and it was a beautiful day. Upon entering, we were told we would have to wait 20 minutes for a table outside, but it was more like 20 seconds, which was nice. The beer menu didn't have prices on it, so that was a little inconvenient. The cheapest special they had for the holiday weekend was $4 Miller. We each drank a beer and left, due to this. It was a nice atmosphere and good service, but if you're looking for good, reasonably priced drinks and food specials, this is not the spot. Although, I'd stop back for Happy hour, if that makes a difference.",

    "text": "So I was at a yoga class with my close personal friend, Snooki, from TV's \"Jersey Shore\".    While doing a Warrior One pose, she whispers to me \"You know, it's really fun to take a leak in public\".  Knowing how conservative and middle-aged I am, I figured she was just trying to get me to blush so I told her to zip it.  Of course if she could do  that, she wouldn't be pregnant now!  Fast forward to lunch on a sunny Saturday at Jerome Bettis' Grille 36....I visit the men's room and lo and behold, they've got this one way mirror in front of the urinals so you're facing the bar while taking a leak!  You can see people right outside but they can't see you (at least I hope not).   That was a very freaky experience, but I can see where Snooki was coming from...it was kind of cool.  Now, onto the food.  My friend and I sat on the patio. It was sunny and we weren't under a tree so it got pretty hot with no shade.   We started with the soft pretzel sticks.  They were great!  Then my friend had the mac and cheese and I had the meat lover's flat bread.  He liked his food and mine was tasty, although if the flatbread had been crispier, it would have been nearly perfect.  Our server was like a Pittsburgh version of Matthew McConaughey.  He was laid back to the point of being in a coma and I could barely understand a word that he mumbled.  But he was nice, our drinks were never empty and he got us our food, so there you go.  The decor is really nice and everyone there was friendly.  I don't think it's fine dining, but for solid food and nice service, I would recommend this place.",

Every single person at my table had the same opinion of the food: it was nothing special.  I had the Burger 36, and with its blend of sirloin, short rib meat and bacon it sounded pretty good.  But it was less flavorful that I expected.   Our waitress was exceptional, but I did notice other tables not getting as good service as we did.  Looking at the other Yelp reviews, I would think fair to middling service was the norm, and our good service was not the norm.  One particular aspect of the restaurant might entice someone to downgrade or upgrade the restaurant rating by one star:  the men's room.  Behind the hostess table is a mirror.  When you enter the very dark men's room right behind it you realize the mirror is actually a one-way mirror over the men's urinals.  One member of our party was weirded out by the fact he was peeing while looking out at people entering the restaurant.  One other member of our party liked that he could pee and watch the football game mounted at the entrance.  To each his own, but I was ambivalent and used the stall.",

The food I did order was very good the \"TOT\"- chips were nice and crispy and the toppings were amazing. Also I ordered a Sesame chicken salad, very delicious. They only thing I wasn't okay with was the price. I think you're paying for \"Jerome Bettis\" rather than the quality of the meal. I would return.",

The food I had was the bbq pulled pork sandwich and it was really delicious. I also had sweet potato fries with caramel dipping sauce which our server Shelly recommended us to try. It was a great combination. She was very kind and personable. It made the overall experience awesome. Next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area I'll definitely return.",

Very dirty floors with food and napkins all over the place. He sat us with menus and we waited and waited and finally a server who was not ours came over and asked what we wanted to drink,2 waters an ice tea and a beer. Our actual waitress came with 1 water 1 ice tea and the beer. I asked for my water as she asked us for an app order.We ordered the nachos. She came back in a few minutes and we put in 2 burgers and an order of wings. Few minutes went by and the nachos came and they was pretty good. Then we waited for about 45 minutes and they kept saying the kitchen is a little messed up but we noticed that people who say after us had gotten their food already so we asked a few minutes later and still no food. Manager came over and used the kitchen excuse and asked what they could do for us. We said just bring out our food. Finally came and was defiantly not worth the wait. Burgers had a taste of dirty grill and just bland. The tots I got were just not very good. They gave us some money off as they seen we didn't eat most of it and told us please come back and try again. Pretty sure we won't.",

My husband got the fish and chips but substituted the chips for mac n cheese. The fish was great. The mac n cheese was basically a full meal on its own but was incredibly heavy.

Waited 40 mins, which I really didn't care about then when we were the last party waiting, host staff asked what we were doing.  I said waiting, of course.  They said we were notified of outlet table earlier so I showed them my phone.  Apparently we could have seated much sooner but we weren't sent any notification.  Whatever.  Ordered a cocktail with Maker's.  It was not awesome, served in a plastic cup, probably a total of 4oz of liquid - $14.  Wife's drink was similar, $10 and not worth it either.

It wasn't terribly busy. No line or ppl waiting, however the hostess was completely overwhelmed.  Ok so we get sat outside.  The table was wobbly and took about ten minutes for a server to come over.  Such chaos!  Food runners were bringing food to wrong tables...it was terrible.  We finally got our appetizer firecracker shrimp (after it was almost pawned off to three other tables)-it was amazing.   We ran out of drinks halfway through the appetizer---and then our food finally came after they thought they already served it to us.  It was cold!  Our waitress finally brought my husband a beer, it was the wrong one.  I got up two times to refill my water myself.  Really really poor experience!",

We told the server that we would take care of her because we would be here all evening to watch the STANLEY CUP FINAL. She barely showed up. Service was so bad, we gave up on her and just ordered from the bar.   The absolute worst part, though, is the DJ. They have the TV volume turned off when the puck is not in play, and instead some idiot DJ who clearly has never watched a single game of hockey is blathering on and on, reminding us that we are watching the Penguins play a game. A lot of people were expressing their displeasure over the fact that we couldn't hear any of the pregame commentary. One of our party found a manager and asked that they put the TV volume on, and the answer he got was, \"We turn off the DJ when the puck drops. That's just how we do it here.\" Idiots. Idiots. Idiots. They are absolutely killing the atmosphere.   I thought this place was annoying during football games with the DJ coming on during every commercial, but this is beyond the pale. Seriously, never again. If I could give zero stars, I would.",

Very nice, because it's True, doesn't matter where you live, you can like any team.  We ordered our food, got burgers and the food came out in a timely manner and everything was very good. Our server was good too.  The servers walked around and cleaned up the floor in our area all night and kept the dinning area very clean.  My only complaint, I went to the bathroom before we left for the concert, it looked like a tornado happened in there! Toilet paper everywhere, half the stalls didn't have toilet paper, or the new rolls where sitting on the dirty bathroom floor! The trash can was overflowing and paper towels were all over the floor. It was just a VERY dirty bathroom. There are enough hostess outside of the bathroom, standing at the desk, that someone could check the bathroom.

I went with a Guinness cause you can't go wrong with that. Within ten minutes, I received a text notifying us our table was ready. We were seated outside on the patio with a wonderful view of The Point. Our table was in the sun and we were hot so we were about to ask if we could move to another table with shade. The manager could tell we were in need of assistance and came over to introduce himself (Eugene). What a gentleman! He escorted us to the other table and proceeded to take our order himself. He explained that they had an unexpected surge and so staffing levels weren't what would be ideal. Well we couldn't tell. Eugene  made us feel like VIPS. He tended to every detail of our visit. Eugene did what a lot of managers don't do in a tight situation - he rolled up his sleeves and helped his staff. Now to the meal. I ordered the deep fried cheeseburger which was deep fried deliciousness. I had a second Guinness as well and my wife ordered a second cocktail which she enjoyed as much as the first.

TVs are at every angle and I mean EVERY ANGLE, even in the booths.  That was another highlight, huge divided privacy booths big enough for 4 with 6 people's worth of room. Fast, friendly service from our waiter Niko kept the mood perfect.  A large beer/wine selection upped the odds of leaving tipsy.  We ordered the loaded nachos for the appetizer and we loved them.  Enough for 4 people.  For entrees we got the sliders and salmon.  I don't think the food was mind blowing but it was fresh, hot and full of flavor, adequate.  Afterwards we sat and the bar and had a few more drinks because at this point we were highly satisfied with the pace and efficiency of the night.

Other than that it wasn't anything that great tasting. As far as stoping in here before a game and grabbing a beer I would AVOID this place. I usually only get drug in here because the people I'm with want to stop in and check it out. I know most places around this area especially at game time get busy but this place is not worth your time during a game day. I wouldn't even stop in just to look around as it gets so packed you can barely even move around in the place. The last time I stoped in 10/22/17 was the first time I actually got very rude service from the bartender. You could tell he was overwhelmed by the number of people ordering drinks but there is no reason to  be disrespect to paying customers with a bad attitude. Also if you don't like waiting for 20 plus minutes just to get you and your buddies a quick beer definitely don't try this place. The Tilted Kilt that is pretty much so next door is the place I would recommend 100 times over this place on a game day. They keep things rolling over there and there bartenders slay drink orders left and right. The only time I would give grille 36 another shot would be during a week day but I'll never be out there to try it for that seeing as I'm only in that area for Steeler games.",

I can't get too in depth on things here since I had chicken strips while sitting at the bar.  It was packed for a Thursday happy hour, good, kinda loud music playing. Not too loud though. Decent selection of beer on draft and plenty of seating, probably not enough before a Steelers game though.  I gave it 4 stars because the beer was cold and the service was quick. And the chicken was pretty good. Will be back sometime to actually hang out and eat a meal.",

The person who answered the phone asked if I meant college football, I said yes but that it was the specific network channel I was asking about to watch a game. Was told yes, they can show all games. Got there tonight and asked for an SEC network game to be put on, and was told that \"Once the TVs are on something, they can't be changed.\"  Mind you, we were two of four people currently in the bar area at 7:45pm on a Saturday. The bartender then said she could check on it. Came back saying they couldn't get it, we questioned if they didn't have the channel, or if they just couldn't put it on one of the TVs, was told a vague answer of \"yeah, we can't, but sometimes the satellites get messed up.\" We ordered, on tap drinks were good, mixed drinks not great; food was okay, nothing to rave about and took a while to get for not being very crowded. Waitstaff was attentive, but not necessarily friendly, and there were a lot of them just congregating around talking to each other. When we left, two employees were outside the front door smoking. Have been before and definitely seems like service has gone down hill.",

The hostess set us down right and it took 20 minutes for a waiter to come and get our order and drinks. I would get it if it was busy but it was almost empty! No wonder it was empty there service sucks! Then an hour passed our waiter disappeared and I had to ask another waiter for our food because my one year old was soo hungry like come on! So our food was brought but it was wrong and I had it! Wanted to talk to the manager and ask to talk to him he never showed up! No one came after  30 good minutes passed by our baby was no one came with the check out food was wrong we didn't even eat it we left! Never again! Guys don't go eat there!!!",

When we walked by, we asked the servers outside if we could bring our dog and they were so friendly and welcoming and made sure the dog was taken care of and brought water for him. The service was so great all around. We did go there later in the evening on a Friday night, but it wasn't even that busy and all the servers were so attentive to their tables and made time to connect with each of them (not in an annoying way) and have good conversations. Our server, Gabriel was fabulous and so engaging, he made great recommendations and hooked us up. The whole staff was phenomenal. My friend and I split the bill and Gabriel accidentally ran my card for both. We didn't realize until after the fact but just decided my friend would Venmo me her portion. A few minutes later the manager proactively came out and apologized for what happened and asked if she could fix it for us. It was honestly no big deal and something my friend and I could take care of our end but we definitely appreciated the offer and the desire to solve the problem without us even having to bring it to their attention. We had such a great night all around but a big shout out to Jerome Bettis' Grille for being the highlight.",

The chips & queso tasted like the chips were purchased from the 99 cent store. Stale and tasteless. The queso was thick and gooey instead of creamy. My brother-in-law ordered a 2nd beer that took 15 minutes to arrive. I ordered a refill for my Diet Pepsi and she brought it back without ice (??). My sesame chicken salad was fairly good, but the dressing was too thick, sour/tangy and tasted store bought. We ordered a dessert to share at the table among the four of us, but we couldn't pass the dessert around because the server never removed our finished plates from the table. We had to stack them high in the center of the table. The server was nice, but did not seem very well trained. I would not recommend this place at all.",

He was kind, attentive, and had a wonderful sense of humor. Despite being extremely busy and waiting many, many tables, he still found time to not only take a few minutes to talk to us, but also to leave a hand-written note on our bill. George, if you read this, thank you again for the wonderful evening of service!!!  Where to begin? Grille 36 has always been a favorite of mine, but I don't often get down there because the parking situation on the North Shore is always a big tenuous. As my girlfriend had never been there and as we were both in the mood for sandwiches from somewhere different, we decided to brave the Pitt game day parking situation and give it a shot.  We were seated within minutes of arriving even though it was busy, which I thought was excellent as it was clear there were many people watching the second half of the game and lingering. Our server, as stated above, was wonderful from beginning to end and was probably the best we've ever had.   I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger, which was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful blend of flavors. The fries were also excellent. My girlfriend had the Blackened Fish sandwich and she was very pleasantly surprised as well.   We also took George's advice and tried the deep fried pretzels, which were one of the better appetizers we've had while eating out. The queso and mustard dipping sauces were very flavorful.   We topped off our dinner with a slice of the carrot cake, which was enormous. We split it in half and still ended up with some to take home!   You get a lot of value for what you pay and the selection is quite wide. We'll definitely be back!",

You can definitely find things to do after you're done eating here.",

To the food  Korean BBQ tacos not up to par.  Beef ok but too thick like skewers of beef instead of True Korean bulgoki.  The best part was the side salad with a kick o wasabi in sweet dressing.  Turkey Parmesan burger was great.  Big piece of meat. A good 1/3 of pound it seems made like a pizza burger.  Sauce was great and they did not overstuffed it with mozzarella.  Great dish around the bar.",

Soggy fries that no one finished, overlooked flavorless burgers and dry chicken sandwich.  Each person left less than satisfied. The burgers were clearly not fresh, they looked like the kind you get out of the freezer case.   Service was a bit haphazard. Kept our drinks filled but didn't put condiments on the table, had to get them myself.   Server was nice enough though.   The location and atmosphere held promise and the outdoor seating is great.

Between my party, we ordered a Mac & Cheese dish, a turkey burger, wings, fried fish, and a salad.   Portion-wise and aesthetically, it was OK. Not super fancy, but not crappy either. The problem arose when we all realized the cook had apparantly never heard of salt, or any other seasoning for that matter. It was all bland, bland, bland. The salad was the most flavorful thing!  There isn't much you can do to screw up a fish filet, which was what I ordered, and I was OK with what I received for the price. I just expected a lot more from a super great place like this. The fourth star was for our amazing server- she was a heck of a gal, and if the food matched, I'd be back.",

I ordered the black and bleu burger and ordered it medium; it came out extra well done and was very dry.   I ordered a bourbon smash and it came out in a tiny plastic cup. When I got it, the cup was only 3/4 of the way full and there was a ton of ice. What really was disappointing was they charged me $14 for a sub par drink!!  The service was very slow. It took over an hour for our appetizers to come out (tatchos, quesadilla, and a buffalo chicken flatbread). We were at the restaurant for over 2.5 hours because it took another 50 minutes for our meals to come out after our appetizers. Very disappointing.

    "text": "I'm going to bed hungry tonight because we choose to have dinner at Jerome Bettis' Grille 36. So we went there on Saturday night before the Steelers -Chiefs game. It was a present to our 19 yr old son for his birthday. He really wanted to go and I looked at the menu and gave it a thumbs up. We got there at 6:30 (to be fair, remember, Saturday night before a big game) and they said it would be a 90 min wait. Okay, our son really wanted to eat there. We were seated at 8:15. We ordered the nachos and my wife wanted one of their appetizer Bloody Mary's. They were both excellent, the Bloody Mary was served with 4 garlic shrimp that had a lot of taste. The nachos were 8 inches high and were some of the better ones that I have had. Jalepenos, olives, a lite cheese sauce, and a tasty ground beef. Yum. Before they came, we all ordered burgers, let's say about 8:30-40. At 9:30, our embarrassed waitress came back and said that there had been a meltdown in the kitchen. I'm a reasonable guy, I said \"just bring us good food, and all is well\". Three burgers, fries and that's it. The manager came over in the meantime and bared his soul that he didn't know why this was happening, but it was obvious that we were about the fifth table he had spoken with and he'd had enough too. By 10:00 we had had enough.  No burgers in site. Our waitress did her best to keep us there and actually paid for the food and drink that we had. I couldn't let that happen, and gave her cash for the food and drink consumed. I also gave her a healthy tip because this wasn't her fault. It was actually her that suggested the YELP review because Jerome and management read them.   So here is your message. Great concept. Really good wait staff help. Questionable management, and some of the worst execution that I've seen. 4 hours and no entree?  Unacceptable. I'm not going back. I don't want a coupon or a phone call. I'm reviewing this to tell you if you execute like this, you won't have a business. Save yourself.",

We all started off with drinks - margaritas, mojitos, mixed drinks and drafts! The appetizers were great, especially the nachos! For our meals, a few people had the southwest club, that they said was delicious! I had the Black and Bleu burger and it was great! I would definitely go back and like to try the deep fried hoagie.

The host was pleasant. He later also became our server.  The only bizarre part was that he sat us next to the only other table of people in the restaurant.  Their party had about 12 people and it just would've been nice to have a bit more space and less volume.  But we got past that by admiring the variety of memorabilia on the walls.  If you are a football fan of any sorts,  it's definitely interesting to see the pictures,  jerseys,  trophies and more. I ordered a burger.  It was prepared just as i requested and quite tasty.  We did order one of their specialty cocktails also and enjoyed it too.  I'd love to come back during football season. I imagine this would be a great place to watch the game.",

We sat down, got our drinks and menus right away. We put in our order fairly quickly, but then proceeded to wait for 40 minutes for our food. I got mine right away, but the server told my co-worker that they didn't have what he ordered.  They didn't tell us in the time that we waited that the grill was down and it was an extremely limited menu. He requested the menu again and proceeded to eat his side salad. After waiting 10 minutes for the menu he decided not to get anything else because he didn't want to wait another 40 minutes and be late.   Other tables were also quite upset with service. Another individual ordered steak rare, but came out burnt to a crisp. Another table ordered appetizers shortly after we sat down, and did not receive them until after we got our entrees. Not only that, they ordered the sliders, and were not told that they were unavailable due to the grill being down until after they received their wings as apps.   Never once did the servers ever seem to care or try to improve their attitudes. I would have been understanding with the grill being limited as long as we were told ahead of time, or if they actually seemed to care about the us.  After waiting another 20 minutes for refills and the check, we finally left and will not be returning.",

The place was empty which was surprising but then we understood why...  We were sat on the patio as requested and it took 15 minutes (not exaggerating) for a waitress to acknowledge we were there.  It took another 10 minutes for our two beers to be brought to us.  It was unbelievable how slow she was.  While we had our drink and looked at the menus, one of the servers across the patio yelled at a group of customers who moved an umbrella to block the sun.  That was enough for us, we closed our tab and went across the street to Tequila Cowboy and had a great afternoon!  Sad to see Bettis' go so far downhill.  Best location in Pittsburgh but that alone won't get it.",

    "text": "We were in town and wanting to watch his Jets and my Steelers, so we thought Bettis' would give us a good mix of \"being with the crowd\" actually attending a game, and \"being able to watch on TV.\" We were correct in that regard, though the TVs were a little on the small side. I'm spoiled though, so I didn't actually complain about that or anything. Just something I noted. Being as it was game day we got there early, and despite being told there was a 2 hour wait, were seated within 10 minutes (our first drink at the bar hadn't even been poured yet.) I'm sure it's hard to guess whether a group is staying for the whole game or just trying to eat before heading to the game, so that was sort of understandable.  I started with a mimosa, and then found out they were $8....and since they were served in a plastic 5oz water cup....not exactly worth it. We opted for the Miller Light $4 special instead. We shared a pile of wings, and the spinach/artichoke dip. The dip was one of the better ones I've had, and even though I'm not typically a pork belly person, it definitely added a little something something. The wings were good too, definitely meaty! We tried black and gold BBQ and Hot Buffalo. Whoo! That was hot. For serious.  Overall, it's good people watching and sports watching, especially on game day, but there are a few things that could be improved upon (like the mimosa situation.) They had fun raffles and whatnot throughout the game too which was fun.",

He even took us outside and pointed out some awesome facts about the city.  Jason was very informative.  Being huge Steeler fans we bring our growing family  out every year for the game.  This is the first time a manager at any of the places we patronize has taken the time out to make sure we make the most of our visit.  Not even the staff at all the hotel we are staying at was able to provide this info to us.  We are very grateful to Jason and will be back.  By the way the food was great.

Cmon...when you walk into this place you should know exactly what you're getting yourself into. Throw healthy out the window-drink a beer, eat some nachos and watch some sports. Enough said.   I get giddy every time I visit Pittsburgh. My family drove from DC to Detroit to see the Bus in the Superbowl. Sitting on a bar stool at Grille 36 just flat out made me happy. I don't even remember if the food was good actually. Or if it was loud, or if the service was good for that matter. I remember meeting nice people,  there were sports on everywhere, I was with my family, and it was a blast.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and relaxed, the lights are dimmed. The food is really good and the service is good as well! They have some different food to serve. I recommend the perogie flatbread, it's an appetizer but I had it as my deal and the portion was a good size and it was really good! If I'm down in the North Side, Jerome Bettis Grille is the place I'm most likely to go to.",

I ate there with a champion wing maker.  He made fun of me for ordering the dry rub wings.  However, he ate half of my dozen and started on his own dry rub when we returned home.  Tbe Barnyard burger is up there with the best burgers I ever had.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the prices are a little high.  Not high enough to keep me from going,  But high enough to limit my trips.",

    "text": "So we've now went to Jermoe Bettis Grille 36 4 times to keep trying it and officially are DONE with it. Every time, it's mediocore at very best.   Second time we went we took Steeler fans from out of town who wanted to try it because well they loved The Bus and love the Steelers. So we went. All ordered the cavatapi mac and cheese. All 3 were cold to the point that the shredded cheese they put on top not only didn't melt it was still cold throughout. Gave it a stir. Still cold througout. Sent back and ordered buffalo chicken tenders. Came out like fryer had never been changed in a year - had that burnt taste to the breading, and they came out cold. Allow me to mention I hate my food too hot anyways so it has to be colder than hell before I'll notice.   Third time we ordered the nacho tower thingie. Mound of chips. Well it's huge. But once you get one inch into the nachos, you have 4-5 inches of chips left and no toppings. And again - cold. Cheese is melted a touch but rest of toppings are cold and make it cold as well. Wife ordered one of the deep fried hoagies. INteresting I suppose. But cold in the middle, what a trend here.   Fourth and FINAL time we went - here recently. Got a wild hair and decided to go in for appetizers. Got the firecracker shrimp thingie appetizer, and the breading all came off the shrimp. None of it stuck. Then our chicken tenders were not fully cooked in the middle. I kid you not they were pink.  We're done. We wanted it to be good since we're homeowners downtown. But with all the new great places opening up we don't need it to anymore. Besides the game day crowd will keep it open me thinks. But it really is pretty mediocre food. And not in a good way.   Service wise - not too bad actually. Rather attentive actually. Oh and the mens room, make a trip just for that. The urinals are below a two way mirror. You are behind hostess stand about 2-3 feet from other patrons staring right at them as you piss. It's awesome. You're looking right at them through the two way mirror as you handle your business. Coolest bathroom ever. Food wise - just don't go.",

The only downside was that my wife and I were seated at a table with no light.  My bacon barbeque burger was delicious, fairly priced at $10 including a nice helping of tasty french fries.  My wife made a hearty meal of two side dishes: macaroni and cheese ($5), and mixed vegetables ($3).  The scrumptious macaroni and cheese side dish was what some restaurants would no doubt offer as a full portion.  Her glass of house wine was fine, but for $6.50, it was not a bargain.  Attentive and friendly service from Brian made the meal most enjoyable. We liked that the restaurant was still serving after the Pittsburgh Pirates game, our arrival being after 10:30 p. m. We shall return!",

After a few minutes waiting, another bartender asked if we had been helped and we said yes, asked us what our order was and poured it for us.  The other bartender began arguing with us and the other bartender as to who was serving us.  They were clearly irritated with us and each other.  We quickly got our drinks and headed outside where a manager immediately stopped us and said we could not sit out here unless we were being seated to eat.  Although I could understand such a policy if they were very busy, but there was tons of open seating and she was extremely rude.  All of this happened in about 5 minutes.  We sucked down our beers and jetted.  We love Pittsburgh but this will never be on our list again.  The other bars around here were much more fun, accommodating, and fantastic!",

We arrived about 2 hrs before the game and was told it would be about 45 minutes before a table would be ready.  We agreed to wait.  In less than FIVE minutes, we were seated at our table and promptly greeted by Jasmine, an incredible waitress. She quickly took our drink order, gave us our menus and suggested some appetizers for us to consider. When she came back with our drinks, we placed our appetizer and entree orders.  The appetizers came out quickly and the entrees came out about 20 mins later.  All of us raved about the food.  Jasmine was exceptional.  We never felt rushed and she certainly made us feel at home.  The prices were very reasonable and we walked to the game with time to spare. Kudos to Jerome Bettis and mega-kudos to Jasmine.  We will be back next time we are in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "My family and I ate here last night for dinner. It was our first time at the Grille, and I have to say we had a phenomenal time!! Jasmine was our waitress, and I would recommend people request her for their server if they plan on dining here! She was very knowledgeable about both the food and the drinks! My father originally wanted the fish n chips but Jasmine sold him on the perogie flatbread, and he is a creature of habit, change is a difficult concept for him. My friend ended up getting the fish in chips, which he said he loved! My mother finally found the perfect Turkey burger (but maybe would get it without the bun next time) and I ate the shrimp tacos which were delicious! We also got the pretzels (BOMB) and the Nachos for appetizers. For drinks Jasmine made sure my mom's Top shelf long island ice tea, stirred not shaken no lemon was made correctly every time! This is my moms favorite drink and it is so hard to find a restaurant that maintains consistency in making drinks as such. At one point my friend and my mother both had a Long Island but one was darker than the other, perhaps indicating the bartender poured too much coke in one and not enough in the other, but Jasmine quickly amended the problem and brought my mother another drink that was identical to the ones she had before. Overall, my family and I had a wonderful experience here. Food, atmosphere, service A++, was just awesome! We had so much fun we will definitely be back!",

Chris was able to provide us with a gluten free menu which had selections such as buffalo wings and burgers (yes they have gluten free buns). They also have a separate section of the kitchen where they prepare their gluten free food. Perfect for those with food allergies. Outdoor seating is great (perfect location right on the water and near the parks) and a definite stop for those going to a Pittsburgh sporting event. Oh...and they have plenty of local beers on tap.

    "text": "So my family and I drove to Pittsburgh to watch the Steelers vs Bengals game since it was blacked out in our viewing area.  After some searching and talking to the concierge at the Wyndham we decided to head over to Grille 36.  We were a little apprehensive because of some of the reviews, but wanted to give our oldest a chance to see the stadium up close.    We had the BEST time and will be going back (despite the 5 hour drive) sooner the later.  Our party of 5 was made up of 4 Steelers fans and 1 Bengals fan (and 3 of the 5 were children ranging from toddler to teen).   The atmosphere and the staff were great.  They had a fantasy football game and gave out bracelets to the kids.  Sure everyone picked on my poor Bengals fan husband, but it was all fun and goodnatured and he wasn't the only Bengals fan in the building.  He even remarked how cool everyone had been once we'd left.  As far as the food goes the best I can come up with as far as a complaint is that the nachos were only so so and probably not worth the price.  Other than that we had 2 orders of the wings, dry with 3 different sauces (at our excellent servers suggestion), 2 orders of the fried pretzel sticks, the breakfast burger, the deep fried burger, the horseradish cheddar burger, the carrot cake and the chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cake. All were wonderful.  We were expecting the price to be on the expensive end, but despite all the food we had, plus drinks, including a tip we still priced out at under $200.    My introduction to the Steelers was with the Bus and he has always been my mothers favorite.  When we left Grille 36 I made sure to call her and tell her it was the greatest day EVER!",

On game days, they have giveaways for Q&A's etc...nice touch! a guy also gets on the mic periodically to pump up the crowd...very cool. We always get the chicken nachos for an app - HUGE and delicious. My favorite entree is the mac and cheese - oh my gosh SO GOOD. Corkscrew pasta with a delicious cheese blend, tomatoes, scallions, bacon, breadcrumbs = heaven. My husband gets burgers and likes them, and one friend got the huge steak and it looked like somthting off the flintstones. We've always had really good service and leave happy. There is always a beer special and the food prices are good too - which is a True testament to the place and to jerome, because given the location and everything he could definitely charge SO MUCH more, but he loves us pittsburgh fans!!!

We hosted our son's Bar Mitzvah party with 125 guests at Bettis' and everyone had a fantastic time.  The River Room was transformed into an awesome dance space for the kids and adults.  Everyone was able to spread out into the bar and patio area.  We did not lack for space, especially considering the gorgeous weather along the river. I worked with Missi over the past few months selecting the menu, room layout, vendor coordination, etc.  She provided everything that we asked for, including delicious food and service.  They were catering to both the kids and adults.  Some of the reviews have mentioned the TV's.  We had a looping photo slide show playing on most of them.  Every time you looked up, you couldn't help but pause and watch.  Just the effect were were hoping for!  The staff went above and beyond, assisting in set-up and clean-up beyond their regular duties.  Toia (sp?) was especially gracious and bonded with our family.  You would never know that this was there first time hosting a Bar Mitzvah party.  I hope that our party leads to future bookings. FANTASTIC VENUE!!!  Thank you so much!!",

The vegetarian burger was incredibly dry and bland.  The carrot cake was as HUGE as my husband's HEAD with lovely cream cheese icing (not taking off points for the embarrassment I felt when it was delivered to my table).  The service was very good - our waitress was terrific.  She responded well to all of our concerns.  Great service  made up for mediocre food.  I wasn't expecting much, I am kind of a food snob,  but I knew what I was getting myself into when I came here.

    "text": "My Dad only turns 70 once. I asked him what he wanted for his birthday, and he said a night at the Pirates game with all of his kids. So that's what he got.   Since the Parents don't know the city that well. They asked for suggestions on where to eat near the park. We decided on Grille 36.   It was CRAZY busy when we got there, but they quickly got us a table for five. We sat down and our waiter was there in a jiffy. He didn't tell us his name, unfortunately. But he was amazing. We quickly had our drinks, and refills.   I had been previously to Grille 36, and recommended the Fried Cheeseburger. So, everyone but dad got that. Haha! It was still as good as I remembered. Dad got fish and chips, and he shared them with his favorite daughter..me. I'm a lucky girl. He really enjoyed it and ate the whole plate!   Right before we were to get the check, the waiter came over and asked if we were going to the Pirates game, and we said, \"yeah, for dads birthday!\" And ten minutes later, he came back out with a giant plate of brownies, ice cream and a little skewer on top, lit like a birthday candle. He sang a horrible rendition of Happy Birthday, but we didn't care. You could tell that it's something they don't usually do, but this guy went above and beyond to make sure my dads meal was special. So, thanks, nameless waiter.   I hope I can take my dad back someday.   Happy Eating!",

The table concluded that the broccoli was overcooked but excellently seasoned. Word to the wise: the desserts are enormous. The cake was five layers and could have fed a family of four. The brownies with ice cream was likewise quite large, something like four servings. Brownies were good. Our server handled our booth have sex with aplomb.

The only reason this was not a 5-star is because they kinda made a big deal about my extremely well behaved service dog.  They requested to her license which is actually illegal to ask for.  I hope that Jerome Bettis' Grille's management will post the service dog laws in their back room and educate their employees about the legalities.

What's worse is that it was slow and yet no one decided to clean. People were coming in for their shifts just standing around gossiping at the host stand. There were flies and moths flying around. We sat next to a dirty table the whole time we were there and we were there for an hour. That table was still dirty when we left. My sister ordered a burger cooked medium. What she actually got was medium-well to well done. I ordered a chicken sandwich which was a chore to chew. We came to Pittsburgh to see the baseball game and to come to this restaurant. I'm not sure who Jerome has running this place but I'm never coming back. This place is in a prime location and with his name attached to it, you'd think it'd be better run.",

After some absent service, I ordered the mini pierogies, which arrived with a seasoning on top that tasted uncannily like chicken flavored ramen seasoning packets. For my meal, I ordered the greek salad and added shrimp. When my salad arrived (45 minutes later), it only had 5 shrimp on it (which cost $6, so over $1 per shrimp) and the shrimp were cold. There was dried cheddar cheese on one piece of pita that came with my salad, but no cheddar cheese was supposed to be on the dish. As I was eating my salad, I noticed a strange yellow substance dried on my bowl...I'm telling myself it was just more cheese. After finally nearly breaking a molar on a kalamata olive that had not been pitted, I decided to give up on my salad--it was mostly the inner parts of a head of iceberg lettuce anyway.  During my most recent visit, the service was poor and the food was terrible. I'm hoping that this was just an off day because the food here used to be good. Hopefully there will be an upswing--it is needed. From just today I'd give it 1 star, but I'll add another for my more positive experiences in the past.",

I found a manager who went and checked on our order and 5 minutes later came back with our plates. He never asked us if there was anything else he could do nor did he apologize that our food took so long. Needless to say we will not be returning to this restaurant on our next visit.

I subsequently learned this and was already worried that they monkeyed with it. I tried to quell my unease and had a bite. It was a hockey puck. So, at best their idea of fixing a mistake was to throw it back on the grill. No new patty. And that is assuming they did nothing sinister to it. I pushed the burger to the front of the bar and asked for the check. No one inquired why I did that or offered to fix it or comp it.

Last time I got the nachos and it was enough to feed a small army. I would stick to the specials on the menu but don't get the deep fried cheeseburger!!! Definitely worth a try on a game day.",

The two gentlemen that were our servers were so welcoming and kind to all of the students. They were so accommodating to all of the students needs and made a point to talk to each of them and make them feel special, you don't find that very often with people serving the public especially this population. We will definitely be back next year and keep making people's days because you sure made ours!! Thanks again!!!",

First impression was the dining room was not very clean. Like it wasn't even cleaned after the game Sunday. We ordered pretzel sticks and chips and cheese for appetizers and that took roughly 20 minutes to come out. We ordered our entree's which took another 30 minutes. The waitress checked a couple times on our food. This seemed to be the theme of the day as there were others around us that had issues getting their food. Once again it wasn't busy. My party of 4 was not impressed with the quality of food. Signature grilled cheese with tomato soup style dipping sauce was tasteless. Boneless wings dry. Fries way over seasoned. So salty. I see why on the Friday before there were 3 pages of guests trying to get in...the tables aren't turned over fast enough because how slow the kitchen is. I love the Bus but would rather go back across the street to Tequila Cowboy on our next visit from Illinois to Pittsburgh.",

I love sitting in the bar because of all the windows and how nice and airy it makes the place seem.  However, contrary to what Bettis Grille may want to believe, this is really just a slightly nicer than average sports bar. The food's not bad. It's not great, but I've had much worse. It sits somewhere in-between. I've never had bad service, but I have only ever say at the bar and thus can't comment on the servers.   The beer selection is decent, but watch out for those cocktails and shots. A mimosa one Sunday cost me almost $9. Ouch.  If you're sitting at the bar, the TV setup is really wacky. I don't know, I just think they could have done better with that. Then again, considering this is a big sports town, I'm a little disappointed at the TV setups in most of Pittsburgh's sports bars.  All in all I haven't mind any of the times I've visited, though this place is nowhere the top of my list. It's just kind of there.",

The wait staff acted like they were slammed and took forever to give us menus, take our order, refill drinks, bring the check, etc.  My friend's wife ordered Sangria and said it tasted like they gave her pineapple juice that they had dyed with another juice to make it look like sangria.  She knows her wine, so I am sure she knew what she was talking about.  She actually returned the drink and ordered something else, and it took like 10 minutes to get her 2nd order which was just a glass of white wine!  Also when we first went into the restaurant, the host and hostess at the table just stood and looked at us like we were intruding.  It took them a couple minutes to greet us and ask if we wanted to be seated!  Moral of the story:  Get your shit together, Bettis Grille.  Maybe Jerome needs to check in on you more often.",

    "text": "My mom and I were spending a girl's night out and decided to check out this restaurant prior to the Pirate game.  We planned ahead and got in line via No Wait, as I anticipated this being a popular spot on a Friday night.  We arrived at the restaurant and I checked in as the app instructed me to do.  The hostesses seemed overwhelmed already (it was only 5 pm) and not one of them politely greeted us.  One asked me if I selected indoor, outdoor or no preference when I registered online.  I said, I'm sorry I didn't as that wasn't an option when I got in line.  She looked super annoyed, rolled her eyes and said, \"That's what I'm asking you.\" So I apologized again (something wrong with this picture here...) and requested outside.  At that point, there were four parties ahead of us.  We waited another 15 minutes before our table was ready.  Once we were alerted, I returned to the hostess desk, informed them that my table was ready.  At this point, there were 4 employees standing at the desk, not busy serving other customers.  One said, you have to now check in with the outside host desk.  Having never been there before, I did not know where that was exactly, so I asked if someone could show us.  One employee, also seemingly annoyed (I'm sensing a pattern here...), lifted his arm and literally pointed at the front door.  Incredulous, I said I needed someone to physically show me the way - not point outside.  We were then  directed outside to the appropriate area, and the next hostess was far friendlier and lead us promotly to our table.    The table wasn't actually ready, as there was still debris and remnants from the previous diners.  So the hostess bussed the table and we settled in.  At this point, it was 1 hour and 45 minutes prior to the start of the game - plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We were greeted fairly promptly by our waitress, she was very friendly, and our drink orders were taken.  We acknowledged that we were going to the game.  It took a solid 15 minutes for her to return with our drinks and take our dinner order.  She apologized for the wait, and we said no problem because at the point we had the whole night ahead of us.  That turned out to be the shortest wait of the evening.  And our waitress became less pleasant and present from that point forward.  We ordered three apps total and a salad.  Our first two appetizers arrived 30 minutes later (?!) and at that point our glasses were bone dry.  We asked for water, which took another 15 minutes.  It's important to note that while the restaurant was somewhat busy, not all of the tables were occupied in our area and it appeared to be well staffed.    It took another 35 minutes to receive our dinner (remember a salad and an appetizer of tacos), and we were starting to get very annoyed.  My mom's salad came without dressing, so the waitress went back to retrieve it.  Not sure if she got lost, but that took an unnecessarily long time as well.  Unfortunately, the game was fast approaching, so we hurriedly ate (not at all how we envisioned this going) and asked for the check.  We also asked for a take out box, as the portions were very generous.  Our waitress served two tables, going in and out, before finally bringing us our check. Guess what, no box.  She served two more tables, in and out, before taking our check and bringing boxes.  At this point, we were 5 minutes from game time, very frustrated and certainly not relaxed.    The food at Jerome Bettis Grille 36 was tasty and generously portioned.  However, the staff was hugely disappointing from the moment we walked in to the moment we hurriedly rushed out.  Despite being well staffed, it appeared disorganized and poorly managed.  The host staff was incredibley rude and the wait staff was not attentive or responsive to our very basic needs.  I will not return to this restaurant for future pre-game meals, nor would I recommend it to anyone interested in spending their time wisely.    Jerome - the city loves you and we are proud of you, but your restaurant staff is letting you down.  I can't imagine these are your standards and you are going to need to act quickly to turn this around before the next influx of sports fans unknowingly settles in.",

I expected lots of football memorabilia (helmets, jerseys, photos, etc.)  However, the only thing really plastered on the walls were letters of congratulations to Mr. Bettis from NFL and local celebrities.  The atmosphere was typical of any sport's bar & grill and I had expected a little more from this place based on the name and location.    We asked the hostess if we could sit near a TV that was showing our favorite baseball team.  When she couldn't find a table near a big screen, she gave us a large booth with our own private, smaller screen where we could change the channel to whatever we liked.  So that was a nice accommodation.  We ended up splitting the nachos which were absolutely huge.  However, we are vegetarians, so we asked if we could substitute the chili for guacamole.  The server asked and the manager said \"no\".  So we paid the extra dollar for the guacamole anyway and it ended up being served in something similar to the little, plastic, ketchup containers you might get at Burger King.  In other words, we would have needed about 12 of these to match the mound of chips we were given.  Overall, the flavor of the nachos was good, but we were underwhelmed by the restaurant's inflexibility and the tiny portion of our appetizer's upgrade.",

So I can't comment on how things are when it's packed. The menu runs the gamut from typical (and reasonably priced) sports bar fare (wings, burgers, etc.) on up to more expensive steaks and \"specialties\". I've found the food to be inconsistent, very satisfying on one visit and then disappointing on the next. But I come to watch my favorite NY sports channels (yep, they get MSG, SNY and YES) while eating at the bar, so I can live with the average food. There is a nice selection of beer and wine, but prices are a bit steep ...$6-7 for a pint of craft beer, $8-10 for a glass of average wine.  Service has been friendly and efficient on my visits, but again, the place has not been particularly crowded when I've been here.  I will also add that the space is very nice. Not only is the restaurant right on the river with a pleasant outdoor patio area for dining, the interior is really very upscale for a sports bar.",

The menu was lacking, the service was just okay, and the outdoor seating was not ideal. The inside was packed so we were seated at a small outdoor area with really low sofa-like chairs and basically a coffee table. It was really hard to eat our food and I was disappointed that my parents didn't get to have a better experience. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Nothing else on the menu really appealed to me. The sandwich was good though. We may have had a better experience if we waited for an inside table or came at a less busy time, but I still don't think we'd go there again. The menu is a little dull for such a wait. I regret not being able to sit inside to check out the decor, but it was understandably packed after the game. My dad was amused by the bathroom with the two-way mirror. At least we can say we went there once.",

    "text": "JBG 36 purports to have been voted Pittsburgh's favorite sports bar/restaurant for as long as they've been on the scene.   Really?  Kay's gonna mercilessly skewer this place if and when she gets around to writing a review, and based on the morsel I had of her Moroccan Pomegranate BBQ Chicken entree, it would be hard for me to argue with her. She claimed it tasted \"processed.\" To me it was just dry and tough.   We both, however, cherished the Gehenna out of the Deep Fried Pretzels. An order gets you a quartet of swarthy kosher-salted staffs  that are essentially the most sinful breadsticks ever kneaded, twisted, and baked. A downright delightful cup of bright yellow honey mustard sauce sat in the middle of the tissue paper bed.  JBG 36 has one vast menu with a great deal of items that are tremendously appetizing reads.   And I ordered a burger, yet again.   I know. I do that when faced with myriad choices, don't I?.   Jerome's Fresh Ground 100% All Beef Half Pound Burger is its name, killing your hunger pangs is its game.   And it was sufficiently charred, juicy, and fresh. The pile of fries that sat to the side were crispy and rich.  There's no way in hell this was 1/2 a pound of beef, though. If that were the case, considering that I was fairly full from a late-morning meal at home, I wouldn't have finished it so easily, if at all.   Our desserts, the Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate (Kay's) and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Bar (mine), were both frozen duds. My after-dinner treat was just plain unwieldy. Judging from the icy plate, I reckon these (you actually get several to an order) sat in a cryogenic state awhile. The mousse part of the bar was fine, but the bottom Nestle Crunchesque part nearly broke my tooth.   Ya just don't freeze candy bars. It should be a federal crime. The \"coconut peanut drizzle\" tasted like sweetened glue with turpentine folded into it.   Don't fret! JBG 36 does have a few things in its favor.   1-It is unswervingly across the road from Stage AE, making it a convenient choice for dinner prior to the Anthrax/Testament/Death Angel gig we caught tonight.   2-Morgan, our excellent server, was such a darling and fun young lass that I feel lousy writing such a middling review. She told us that her boyfriend \"puts whipped cream on everything.\" He is a fortunate fellow.   3-As I said earlier, the menu is large, so there's much to try.   Would I come back? If it's between this and the Hooters-Meets-Piper's Pub joke that is The Tilted Kilt,  then make mine Jerome's.  P.S. The men's restroom is the strangest one I've ever been in. It's dark, cavernous, there are windows that allow you to see out into the bar without being seen, and the sink is...illuminated? No, I was not on LSD.",

    "text": "So this place HAD been in the running for a wedding rehearsal dinner... not anymore.   When the fiance and I arrived, we were seated right away by a girl who was dancing and speaking with coworkers as she walked us to our table. Ok, no biggie. She's just quirky. Our server could have been a football player himself and was nice enough. Fiance ordered a steak and I ordered the brioche-crusted salmon. Since we were looking for rehearsal dinner places, we figured we should get grown-up food and not burgers or sandwiches, and quite honestly that may have been our mistake.  The steak was alright... it's hard to make a steak bad in my book. It definitely was not cooked medium well as he had asked for. I'm a medium rare steak person and it was right on the cusp of being too undone for even me. It had an odd taste to it that wasn't bad, but wasn't necessarily good either.  As for the salmon... well... I probably won't come here again based off of it. The description said that it was brioche-crusted and I believe it also said there was some sort of pesto on it also. The waiter explained when I was ordering that the ratatouille that came with it had a red sauce. I didn't realize that the salmon would also have it. I ALSO didn't realize that the \"red sauce\" was tomato sauce. On salmon. Without any sort of pasta or starch. I had asked for mashed potatoes based on the fact that I didn't want red sauce veggies, and in my mind this would a been the cue for our server to inform me that the salmon also had it. Mind you there was nothing listed on the menu about it having tomato sauce. The fish itself was overcooked also which made it impossible to eat without the sauce giving it some sort of moisture.  Now I would only read this if you are wedding planning, as it is more of a rant, and won't necessarily be helpful for everyone: My fiance recommended this place to me as being somewhere that was \"Pittsburgh\" for our rehearsal since my family and friends are from out of town. We loved the idea of being right on the river and the patio outside, and it's really the best option to chose from being the other ones are Tilted Kilt (nope) and McFaddens (love it, but it is LOUD!) So I decided to use the website and requested info regarding events as they had that option listed. Nothing. Emailed again, still nothing. Since this was a place that fiance really seemed to have his mind set on, I called. The girl that I spoke with was very helpful while on the phone. She stated that she would email me that day with event menu samples and she would research the date to see if there were any Pirates games or concerts she could find yet. This was 3 weeks ago and I still have not heard back from her. I've given up. Even though the location would be perfect, I would be terrified until the day-of that they would forget our group of 26 was coming in.",

Got seated quickly but the wait time for food was horrendous. Took over an hour for the appetizer to come out. Then our waitress was barely around to question where our food was. Food arrived at the table which included 2 burgers and wings. WARNING: do NOT get the wings. Brother in law eats them frequently and loves them but they were so incredibly spicy it destroyed his stomach and he had issues for a few days afterwards. Spoke to the waitress about it and she said they often have many complaints that the wings are dangerously spicy and inedible. If the wings are that spicy and you have that many complaints, the management should do something about it and at least flag it on the menu!!! The salsa and quesadilla were also spicy but not nearly to the point of the wings. Also its disgusting and unsanitary to find out that when the brother in law went to use the bathroom due to the wings, he sees that the cook leaves the bathroom without washing his hands. Honestly this was a total waste and ruined the night. Will not be returning.",

The past couple of times I've been there, the two things I liked most, they got rid of.  I hate it when restaurants do this!  TGI Fridays and Romano's Macaroni Grill are two of the biggest culprits of this!  The last time I was in there, the place had a BAD issue with flies.  Two of them landed on my fries.  They did get me a new order of fries, but that's besides the point.  You've gotta address that issue, because if there's flies, there could be roaches or rats.  It opens the door for a bad precedent.  Also, the last time I was in there, two of the TV's in my area weren't working, and they had billiards or something like that on, instead of other baseball games (the Pirates were off that night).  However, most of the food I've had is enjoyable.  The service isn't fast, but they are nice.  The bathroom is very cool.  When you're standing at the urinals, you can look out into the bar area and see the TV's (they cannot look in and see you though).  And of course, you'll have to pay to park.  It's best to go on Pirates, Steelers, or Panthers game day, or if you're going to a concert at PNC or Heinz, because you're already paying to park.  It can just get very busy in there.",

I like the appearance of the place, but there are way too many bugs and the bar area stinks.... BaaaaaaaaaaDuh! The floor around the bar was extremely sticky on my visit. The bar towels that were being used were gross, leaving the bar itself sticky and stale smelling. My advice: let's get these bar tenders to be more consciousess about cleaning better. I mean HELL.... Not just 5 minutes ago.... One of em dropped a beer glass as he was filling it, and automatically slung his hands back.... AT ME..... Along with beer. Thanks. Lets clean up your act.",

Ordered the flatbread which took an HOUR to get. Was only able to get one glass of the wine I preferred during happy hour because the server said when she tried to put the second one in \" it was x'd out\"- whatever that means. Gave up waiting for a beer at the bar the time I was there before this. Time before that they ran out of Coors light. No dressing on a salad I ordered- then had to wait another 20 minutes to get the waitress' attention to bring me some. Has really gone down hill. Enjoyed the burgers and Mac and cheese there many times in the past, but with the service so bad anymore, not worth the aggravation of going there.",

It feels like any Pittsburgh sports figure could have opened this up and done the same thing, like Louis Lipps or Andy Van Slyke. It's just a kind of fancy looking sports bar that gets away with being overpriced due to the location.    The one thing that stands out is the men's room, probably one of the coolest public bathrooms I've ever been to.  The two way mirror is a fantastic touch.  Good job by The Bus on that one.",

Also, when we were about to leave we asked for boxes for our meals and were provided a folded box instead of styrofoam boxes.

The hubby orders the BLT Double Grilled Cheese Ranch Burger every time we visit.  It is always cooked as ordered and has scrumptious amounts of bacon and cheese surrounding a juicy burger.  I seem to always steer toward the Ultimate Mac 'N Cheese which is actually done really well for restaurant standards.  The service could be a little better as the wait staff always seems to be being pulled in 100 difference directions.  Also, there are always so many hosts/hostesses just standing around.   We have never had to wait for a table but know how uncomfortable it would be if we had to as the entry way and hostess stand are practically on top of each other making you dodge people upon entrance and exit.  There has got to be some way to rectify this.  They have televisions at the booth's but we have yet to get a working one.  It either doesn't even turn on or, if it does, you cannot change the channel it is on.",

Our group came here due to proximity to our hotel, and to the Grille's credit they had our group of 14 seated before we could finish a beer at the bar.  The menu was pretty standard, and most of us stuck to burgers. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food, and they dedicated two servers to our table who did a great job.*  Why only 3 stars? Well the seating area was pretty dirty with crap and food debris all over the floor. I know Bettis' mom personally** and I'm sure she would not have been happy with the cleanliness.  Also, the 2-way mirror in the mens bathroom allows you creep on the hostess desk/entire restaurant while you pee. I'm a creep so I liked this, but it just felt so wrong.  __________________ * They even filled our request of delivering a round of shots we ordered and paid for by announcing they were \"Compliments of The Bus!\" ** By personally I mean from the Campbells chunky soup commercials.",

When I came in with my Brother and friend they staff thought we played professional football. They took us to a private room and when we went in I was in shock. It was ex players having a meeting and they were speaking about football related topics. My first thought was to take a picture but I froze. Once they figured out we were not players they escorted us out. We walked to the bar and one waiter noticed my disappointment for not getting a picture. At the bar I noticed this place was beautiful, it was modern and full of TV's. I loved the atmosphere and everything about the place. We joked with the Bartender and she was pretty cool. We ordered food but my friend asked us not to order any burgers because we always do and that was fine so we got a variety of items and shared. Later on before the food came the waiter walked up to me and told me a player went into the bathroom. Me being me I waited and he came out. It was Mike Logan and he walked up to me. He thought he knew me and I didn't want to correct him. I told him I was a Giants fan and that I respected him and I asked for a picture. He agreed and my night was made. After we sat back down and it was time to eat. The food was good! The shrimp was perfect, the mac & cheese was good, the buffalo sandwich was amazing and the chicken burrito was perfect. I truly enjoyed this place. I hate to say it but I wish there was one in New York. I'm gonna ask my friend to move in just to be close to this place.",

It wasn't their fault; I am just simply ridiculous in large crowds.  I finally made it back here for an actual experience this November.  I went with my sister and brother-in-law and we decided to have a small lunch and beer here after a long day shopping and playing around in PGH.    Grille 36 has a decent craft beer menu (including many local brews) and I opted for a Church Works beer and decided to forego food, although I did pick at my sister's edamame (which were good, but not salty enough).    It was lunchtime during the week and the place wasn't very crowded and we easily got a seat at the bar.  I would love to write more about this place, but nothing really stands out for good or bad reasons.  It was just another sports bar that happens to be owned by a legend and situated beside Heinz Field.  That is definitely its appeal.",

My friend absolutely adores the chocolate cake at this place, so when we were in town for a football game, we thought we'd eat dinner there. Upon entering, the hostess told us it would be an hour and a half wait. It was packed, the night before a Steelers game, so we had expected as much. No big deal. We put our name on the list and went to find seats at the bar.  Upon sitting down at the bar, it took us 25 minutes until the bartender came over to see us. I know they were busy, but it took us nearly a half hour to just get water. We had to resort to flapping our arms to get the bartender's attention.  It was another 20 minutes before we were able to get the bartender's attention - again by flapping our arms - to order drinks.  After almost an hour of waiting, we finally had drinks, and the next half hour passed by rather pleasantly, although we were again completely ignored by the bartender.  After an hour and a half, I went to check with the hostess, who told me it was going to be an additional two hour wait for a table. I told her she had originally told us 90 minutes, but she just shrugged. There's a big difference between an hour and a half wait, and a three and a half hour wait.  Now with both of us a little mad, my friend and I decided to just eat dinner at the bar. We ordered, then proceeded to wait nearly an hour for our food. If it was just me, I would have been long gone, but my friend wanted to stay, so I put up with it.  When my burger did finally arrive, it was ice cold. My friend told me to send it back, but at this point I was upset and hungry and said it was fine. (My mistake!)  Once again having to wave our arms to get the bartender's attention, we ordered dessert, the fabled chocolate cake my friend insisted I had to try. We once again waited 45 minutes, which at this point had become par for the course, only for someone to come out and tell us they had dropped the chocolate cake on the floor and didn't have any more. So I never even got to taste the whole reason my friend and I went to the restaurant.  To add insult to injury, a manager came out and said she wouldn't charge us for the chocolate cake, as if they were actually thinking about charging us for something they had never served us.  Four hours after we walked in the front door, we left the restaurant with no apology, no comped drinks, nothing.  And did I enjoy the Steelers game the next day? No, I did not. I made it through about a quarter and a half before I was in the bathroom puking. When I got home and saw my doctor, he said the most likely cause was food poisoning caused by undercooked meat.  Needless to say, I will never be returning here.",

We were told it would be 20 minutes to get a table.... No problem. Went to the bar to grab a drink. Bartender apperantly hated her life and the lives of everyone there. Draft beer was good. Unfortunately our 20 minute wait turned into 35 and people who sat themselves were getting served while we still waited for a table. Actually, I'd say 85 percent of the servers looked miserable while we waited. Finally got the call. Hostess tells us she's going to be honest about the kitchen and how slow they are tonight. Ok, well thanks for telling us after we waited 35 minutes.  Sat down at a dirty table, ordered drinks and food. Our server was nice but again another employee who hated his life. Fireworks started. Kitchen staff and servers ran out to watch them. I guess it's cool but we still didn't have our food. Food came. It was mediocre at best. Never got silverware or napkins so we just asked for boxes. I went to the restroom.... Yuck a complete mess! A server was in there and we started to chit chat when I was washing my hands. She was telling me how much a disaster of a night it was and it shouldn't have been that way. I agreed and told her I hope her night got better.  Finished our drinks. Left a 20 Percent tip when we shouldn't have (I was a server so I felt bad). We were walking out and I saw the server shake his head when he opened our check. Like really? What was that about? You kind of didn't deserve it but you're now mad about it. I dunno. The whole experience was not good at all. Doubt I will ever go back. Actually, I know I will never go back.

Little bits of goat cheese were in her salad and she picked out every drop.  That was disappointing. The chicken in both of our salads was a little chewy or gummy.  Not very tasty. We mainly wanted to talk so the table by the window and the time of evening gave us time and space to reconnect after many years apart.  I enjoyed my friend's company there but probably wouldn't go back for the food. They also were out of desserts too after spending several minutes going back and forth with the waitress about which desserts were best to try.  I didn't like the sound of any of them, but finally settled on a key lime pie in a glass. I couldn't believe that they didn't have apple pie or even cheesecake...dessert staples!  And the key lime wasn't even a pie! I was settling for that!  They have a great location and the bar looks large but I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on the bar service at all. Very roomy so I would assume that on baseball game days, it's very popular.",

We had given ourselves 95 minutes for parking (paid that much) and ended up having to add money to the meter because the service at Bettis Grille was so slow and incompetent.   I was a server for years and so am usually patient with restaurant servers. I know what it's like when things get busy and you're doing the best you can. Bettis' Grille was NOT busy the day we were there, nor was our server running around. In fact, he spent a lot of time standing up by the computer (where they enter orders) dong...I don't know what!

    "text": "Aw, a mostly average place for such an above-average player!  Came to this establishment earlier this month for an appropriate occasion...to watch The Bus get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, of course!  Made plans to get together with a couple close friends who were visiting town, catch up, grab food and a few drinks, and watch the highlights of the induction ceremony.  That's exactly what we did and all-in-all ended up spending about 8 hours here.  Time flew by because we were having fun, though the fun was mostly due to the company we were with and not so much to the setting we were in.  I expected the service to be decent but not extraordinary.  It was.  I expected prices to be a little on the high side to account for the prime North Shore location a few steps from Heinz Field.  They were.  I expected the food to be slightly above average at best.  That was the case.  What I didn't expect was for the crowd to be thin until the afternoon Pirates game let out.  Getting there several hours before the ceremony began turned out to be completely unnecessary.  Also didn't expect the food portions to be on just the slightly generous side being that we'd heard from several people that portions here are Bettis-sized.  Husband and I shared a steak salad (half yummy pieces, half chewy pieces) and burger (overcooked) and fries (tasty).  As for drinks, after learning the mimosas came with an inexplicable price tag of $8.25 a piece--when I ordered the server told me she believed the mimosas were \"about $5.50 each\"--I opted not to enjoy more than one of those guys.  I also had a couple tasty but weak specialty martinis.  Atmosphere became more fun and lively as the crowd grew in size.  Probably a good option for game day if you want to drink indoors whilst being as close to Heinz Field as possible without actually being in the stadium.  It's rare that I review a restaurant/bar after just one or a couple experiences, but I'm making an exception in this case because, honestly, I don't plan to come back here for quite a while, if ever.  Hopefully Hines' new restaurant in the northern suburbs is a little better.",

    "text": "Awful experience here.  Went out to eat here after work with a few colleagues. The waitress switched my glass of wine with one that was meant for one of my co-workers.  After my co-worker and I tasted our drinks we quickly discovered we had the wrong drinks.  We notified the waitress who took our drinks away and brought new ones, or so we thought.  After tasting the drinks to make sure that we each had the correct one I noticed the lip gloss I had been wearing on the rim of the glass my co-worker had been given.  Apparently instead of pouring us new drinks they came back out with the same drinks, but this time gave them to the right person.  When I spoke to the manager about this she argued with me that they did pour new drinks it was just that the glasses were they poured them in were dirty.  So I guess instead of ingesting each others dirty germs we were ingesting the dirty germs of strangers.  I'm not really sure which is worse. The only recompense she made was to give us the dirty germ infested drinks for free.  Thanks.",

    "text": "I'd be surprised if this place is still in business next year.  Here's my visit:  When: June 21, 2019 after the Bucs vs. Padres game at approximately 10:30 pm.  Almost all of the bars were packed except for JB 36.  Wanted a semi-quiet place to enjoy drinks, me and the crew rolled in.  Service: Service was fast, friendly, and sufficient.    Drink: Ordered a standard Old Fashioned with Bulleit Rye Whiskey.  It was the worst Old Fashioned I have ever had.  After asking the bartender what she put in the drink, I was able to quickly diagnose the problem.  This bar uses cheap maraschino cherries.  You know, the type that's in your fridge that has the cherries floating in the super sweet, synthetic tasting syrup?  Well, when you take one of those cherries and drop it in a cold drink, the synthetic juice of that cherry dissipates into the drink and alters the taste entirely.  I wish they used fresh cherries or at least a higher quality cherry.  My friend had a rum and coke and he said there was almost no rum and it cost $10.  Restroom: I was pretty surprised by the condition of their restroom.  2 of the 3 urinals had black garbage bags tied over them.  I assume this indicates they are out of service?  Unfortunately, several patrons did not get the message and had attempted to use the urinal.    This place used to be awesome, but it has fallen.  It's unlikely I'll be back and I think this place will be out of business by Summer 2021, at the latest.",

    "text": "We come to Pittsburgh once a year and always come to Jerome's.  Over the last few year there has definitely been an overall decline in service.  We arrived as a party of 4 around 730. We were told it would be a 90 minute wait. We expected that.  We ordered drinks at the bar and went outside to enjoy the fresh air.  At 9 pm I thought I would go check at the hostess desk as to our status on the waitlist.  No hostess and what's worse....no more list.  A pleasant employee came by and seemed to be helping others get tables, so I asked him if we were still on a list. He just asked how many we were and got us to a table.  However he never notified the server we were there. 10 more minutes before we saw the server. We order drinks dinner and appetizers.   Drinks came after a little wait.  Meanwhile guests are still being seated.  Now its almost 10 pm.  And finally our appetizers come out.  Cold!  We were so hungry we ate them.  For the record the Asian shrimp and buffalo wings were tasty but would have been better if they were served hot and timely.  So as 1030 approaches and guests that were sat after us have finished their food a kitchen person comes out and says our ticket got all messed up and could we give her our order again. Promises it will be out in 5 minutes.  15 more minutes and I finally had it.  Got up and told server we couldn't take the waiting anymore.  At that moment food finally came out to our table so we sat back down and  ate.  My hisbands hamburger bun was hard as rock and inedible. My nachos were fair.  Salad with salmon was ok and other burger was decent. Not once did a manager ever come over and apologize.  Our server was nice and we felt bad for him.  Our meal was comped so we tipped the server and pretty much will never go back.  The server did tell us that the table that was next to us and left due to the wait was betis' cousins.I do hope they say something to the powers that be. It's a shame to see this place go downhill.",

They also have a deep fried Italian hoagie and cheeseburger which sounds interesting. On my last trip the service was ok. Our waitress seemed busy but still attentive. Food took a while to come out. They sat us in the back dining room all in one cluster. The back side of the room wasn't being used so it was a little odd. All the tables were kinda crammed together. The bar area is nice. It def a nice bar to sit at for a few beers and to watch football. Im sure I'll be back at some point. I'd recommend trying it at least once.",

Today I was here and we were seated outside, there was one very large party and a bunch of scattered smaller groups but overall not crowded at all. Our waitress was very friendly and for the most part pretty on top of things. We were seated outside and it was windy, large umbrellas were just falling over, definitely a safety hazard. Our food took a very long time to arrive and when it made it some of the people I was with said that things were cold. Someone I was with returned her boneless wings as it seemed they had sat out for awhile. I had a salad, I wasn't crazy about the lettuce they used and it was a little lacking on the amount of protein. Obviously love The Bus, but based on the shape this place is in and the fact that nobody ever seems to be there, I would not be surprised if this place was closed in the near future. The surrounding area has exploded in the past few years and I can't imagine the real estate is cheap.",

    "text": "Over the past couple years my family and I have visited the Bettis Grille several times and we always enjoyed our visits. It's a great family-friendly environment, but you get the best of both worlds because it's also a sports bar that you could enjoy on a night out with friends. It's nice to come here in the summer and sit out in the patio area with a great view of the river, but good food is ok in my book at any time of the year!  The most recent time I came to the Bettis Grille was a couple weekends ago to celebrate my brother's birthday. My mom even let him get two sandwiches to celebrate his birthday, although he saved one of the two to take for lunch at work the next day. He went with the crispy chicken sandwich and a deep-fried burger, which my other brother also ordered. My mom and I both ordered appetizers to split and we chose the firecracker shrimp and the quesadilla. I've ordered the firecracker shrimp every time I've come here so far because it's that good. It's tossed in a sauce similar to a sweet chili sauce (one of my favorites) and served over shredded cabbage. There are enough shrimp to share for sure, but if you're ordering this appetizer as your entree, it's the perfect size.  Our food arrived after a decent wait, but it was definitely a busy night as it was the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I can imagine no one wanted to cook after preparing Thanksgiving dinner. My brothers ate their sandwiches super quickly and my mom and I shared our appetizers and enjoyed them both. The deep-fried burgers really are a sight to see, because that's an item you won't find on a typical restaurant menu. Just when we thought we were stuffed and we were waiting on our check, the waitress brought out a huge plate of brownies and ice cream because she heard my mom mention my brother celebrating his birthday. This was such a nice way to end our visit and definitely made me like the Bettis Grille even more than I already did! The brownie was big enough for all of us to share, and we gave it our best shot after already eating our meals and being pretty full. I guess you're never too full for a good dessert, though.  If you're out and about on the North Shore, the Bettis Grille is a great place for family dining or just a good bite to eat! It's priced standard for a restaurant in the city, so expect to pay a little more than you may anticipate for some items on the menu. Overall, I've enjoyed this place every time I've come here and I'm sure I'll be back again before too long.",

The staff was very friendly and brought a dog bowl. I ordered a fat head IPA beer and it was great! I ordered the highest ABV IPA, as I don't usually drink beer much. I ordered the fried chicken entree as there were some food options that the restaurant was out of at the time. Although, my food came out wrong, the staff took care of everything and made things right. I sincerely enjoyed my food and my beer. I will most likely return again in the future.",

We never got napkins or flatware; When we asked for napkins, we got paper cocktail napkins, not the cloth type at the other tables.  When we pointed out that we never received flatware, so that she wouldn't think we stole it, she blamed it on someone else. We had to repeatedly ask for refills on water and soda. Her heart is definitely not in the game. The bathroom (women's) were messy, the floors were very sticky, and there were wadded used towels on the sink top.

I asked if I could order one more (to total 4) so my friend and I could split them evenly. Tacos are hard to split! I was asked to repeat myself and got a smirking response. I requested she ask her manager if it was a possibility. I've had this done before and they've added an al a carte charge, which I told her I was fine with. She came back to deliver some drinks, a long time after, and I inquired about my request. She began laughing and said, \"the kitchen manager said no. He said if you want to do that you can order two orders and he will just throw out two.\"  HOW RUDE IS THAT RESPONSE?! I let her know I thought it was rude and asked to speak to the manager. She said, \"I already did. He said NO.\"  I asked if there was a reason and she replied, \"he said no.\"   We NEVER got the pretzels we ordered. When I was looking at the bill she asked what I was doing. I explained I was making sure there was not a charge for the pretzels I ordered.... she said \"oh shoot. I forgot.\" I agreed and she made no effort to apologize, make it right, and didn't ask if we still wanted them. Just \"oh shoot. I forgot.\"  I never got a second drink, neither did my friend. We went to the bar because our server was missing.   Typically this place has decent food, but the service has always been a crap shoot. There's no reason for the rude service we received that night, especially since we were entertaining out of town guests and wanted to show off their restaurant. We will go elsewhere from this point on. I was embarrassed.",

    "text": "The only word to describe this situation is HORRIFYING. I'm going to start this with clarifying statements.  1. I know how busy restaurants get on Saturdays.  2. I understand it was exactly the time for that late dinner/drinks crowd. 3. The North Shore gets crazy when there is a Pitt game, even away games. 4. I have worked in restaurants before.   THE WAIT: That all being said, we expected a longer wait for a table. What we didn't expect though, was to be told that they \"in no way could even give you an estimate on how long this will take.\"  We had a party of 5 people, not a large group at all. After standing outside in the beautiful weather drinking beers, we soon realized that we'd been waiting for nearly 2 hours.  Eventually this lovely hostess, Christine, approached us (they call your cell phone when a table becomes available) and asked us how long we'd been there. We told her and she immediately got us a table. She was truly a great employee.   THE FOOD: Finally seated, it was another 5-10 minutes before a waiter came over. His name was Bobby and he was clearly young and new to serving. He was running circles around the tables. He obviously had a full section.   2 in our party ordered wings as an appetizer and those actually came out really quickly. They smelled great and I don't think either of them had any qualms with the taste either. This is where took a quick and crazy downturn. We asked the waiter for napkins and refills on beers, we didn't see him again for 10-15min. I actually had to flag down a bus boy/food runner for napkins/silverware. The waiter stopped back and we reminded him about the drinks we needed, which by this point had gone from 2 to 4 beers. We placed our order and 1 in our party ordered the 36 steak. In case you're not familiar with this it's a 56$ 36oz steak. This is a serious piece of meat. He ordered it medium well, and the waiter did let us know that this may delay the food coming as this steak is thick. The rest of us ordered various burgers. By this point I'm starting to get hangry (an anger driven by extreme hunger).   I made certain to stop and tell 2 manager/supervisory types how great Christine was doing and she had even stopped back to check on us just to make sure things were ok!   THE HORROR: We have been at this place for 3 hours now. Waiting for food for a little over 1.5 hours. The general manager stops over to our table with some of the absolute WORST customer service skills I've ever encountered. He did apologize, but it went like this... \"We really don't know when you food will be out. Our kitchen is sort of down right now. It's coming eventually, bro.\" The member of our party who ordered the 36 actually asked him to just forget the steak and get us 5 burgers to go so we could go back to our boat. He also mentioned that if the meal was free we would leave with our burgers to go, make sure to really take care of the server, and leave as happy as possible.   The manager's exact words... \"I don't care if the server gets taken care of, I just want the customers to be happy.\" I was so offended. As I mentioned, I've worked in the food industry as did someone else in our party. That's just too much.   The food came out about 5 minutes after that, including the steak. The steak was so bad that my friend couldn't eat it. It was cold and dry it almost made me choke. This was Denny's/Eat N Park grade steak, not 56$ steak. My boyfriend and our friend had the deep fried burger, I tasted that and it was delicious too.    Here is where I snapped though... I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I am shaky at this point as I've been on a boat in the sun and haven't eaten anything. I put the top of the bun on my burger and grab a steak knife as I almost always have to cut a burger in half.   I saw the burger in half, drooling as meat juices (I also like it medium rare.) and bbq sauce is squishing out. I pick up half of the burger and notice in the very low lighting something far brighter pink than the meat right in the middle of my burger. A PIECE OF PINK PLASTIC IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BURGER. I knew immediately what it was, it was the medium rare indicator that they are supposed to stick in the top of the burger. It was laying flat IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAT.   I shot up out of my seat and took it right back inside and forced the manager to take it from me. I reminded him that this food can't get any more free than it is right now, and I don't have another 3 and a half hours to wait for food. He tried to tell me that it couldn't have been inside it. To which I picked up the other half and pulled the cut in half indicator out of the center. I didn't even get to eat dinner after 4 hours of waiting.  Never ever ever again. I left starving and angry.",

We were here for a late lunch, so we didn't get really adventurous.  My friend had a highly recommended Fried Italian Hoagie.  It was stuffed with salami, pepperoni, cappacola, provolone and hot peppers, battered and then \"yes\" deep fried.  It was crazy good!  My simpler tastes went for the Apple and Blue Cheese Salad with sherry bacon vinaigrette and candied walnuts.  Needless to say, I helped my friend polish off his hoagie and we took most of my salad home!  They also have the very best raspberry iced tea ever!  Service was great.  We had a team of servers attending to our needs, not just one.  They seemed to be working as a mob, even though the place was busy.  My friend commented that the men's room had a two way mirror, I could live without knowing about that.    4 star restaurant, get's another star for being Jerome's.  I said I'm a sucker.

The vegetable...well, the menu had promised a seasonal vegetable of zucchini, squash, peppers, and onions, and once I pointed this out to her, she had the stalk of broccoli that the chef had plated next to the mooing steak removed and brought me the promised side dish--about ten minutes before she returned with a slightly overcooked steak.

    "text": "I went here before a Pirates game and was a little disappointed, both with the pirates and the restaurant.  I love wedge salads and order them anytime they are on the menu.  This particular salad was $8, so I knew it was gonna be big which was ok since I was planning on splitting it.  Well, it was literally a head of lettuce with dressing drizzled over it.  As you might imagine, a coating of dressing over 1 piece of lettuce is not enough for an entire head of lettuce.  The burger I shared was ok, a little undercooked, not the best.  Our waiter brought us the wrong beer, so we got to keep the mistake for free which I guess makes up for the bad wedge salad.    The menu had a good selection of food.  Mostly burgers.  Everything was presented very nicely.  We sat outside along the river which was ok except it got a little windy and my poor mother had to sit in the sun since our table seemed to be the only one without an umbrella.    Oh, and the bathrooms in this joint were so dark!  I had to paw my way around to get where I wanted to go.  This makes me wonder what they are trying to hide. Hmmmmmmm......",

When the phone rang, two girls scampered across the room to answer it as if there was a prize for the first person to answer.  The other girl looked and me and said hello.  I asked if I could sit in the bar area and she said \"Sure, it's self-seating.\"  I picked an empty space along the outside wall and patiently waited while the server was at the table next to me.  I opened my phone to write an email and read a few while I waited....and waited...and waited... After waiting 15 min and receiving no service, I decided to leave.  As I passed the hostess that spoke to me before, she said have a nice day, not even recognizing that I was the same person that had spoken to her just 15 minutes before.  If you want good or fast service, avoid Jerome Bettis Grille 36.  If you have time on your hands, go for it.",

We ordered a few appetizers and beers. It only took about 15-20 min to get our food, I thought much longer since their wait was so long. Our waitress was on top of everything, our glasses never were empty. Food was aright, pretzel sticks were AMAZING, get those if you're getting a app. The bones less wings- are really not wings, but chicken tenders with wing sauce. Buffalo chicken flat bread was good. THEY HAVE BANANA BREAD BEER!!! GET IT!  The inside of the restaurant is obviously sports themed. LOUD atmosphere, there were children there, it's family friendly if you want to bring your kid to a bar.  Bathrooms are ok, little dark.",

They do get a bit slow during busier times, which is one area that could improve.  And, yes, it is a touch pricy, but location, location, location!  Jerome and team have invested in a great location and have outfitted it nicely.  FUN FACT:  The Men's room has one-way glass above waist-height above the urinals.

Let's just say it took well over an hour for our food to arrive, Not sure what happened back in the kitchen, but the wait was totally unacceptable. We did end up getting a sunstantial discount on our meal for the inconvenience, and luckily for us we were not in a crunch for time. Parking was a crapshoot as there is street parking, but unfortunately for us We had to choose a lot for event parking which set us back  $12. We had no wait time for a table which was nice considering there was a baseball game that evening as well, that also contributed to the no parking situation. Our waitress was attentive and the hosts/hostesses were very friendly. The food was surprisingly good. Normally these restaurants that people slap their name on are notoriously not the best for good food, but we thought it was good eats. I went with the Bus Salad. Definitely not a salad for dieters , but definitely a hit in the flavor department. Mixed greens, steak tips, cheese crumbles, corn, tomatoes, onion strings, tater tots, and melted cheese. Very tasty! My husband went with the deep fried cheeseburger, because who can resist a burger that has been deep fried?? No-one! He thought perhaps it would be overdone since it was fried, but it came out juicy and tender. Definitely a must try item on the menu. They did offer a uniform discount which was appreciated.",

    "text": "Jerome Bettis bar and grill. I love this place my wife and I are huge Pittsburgh Steeler fans and we go here every time we're in Pittsburgh. We try to go to Pittsburgh at least once a year to catch a Steelers game. It is a lot harder now since I have two children and and to get a babysitter to watch the girls for the weekend while we drive up to Pittsburgh, but when we do get it we always make sure to go to Jerome Bettis bar and grill on a Saturday night before the big game on Sunday afternoon. The atmosphere of this place is a 5 out of 5 it is absolutely stunning inside the Sports Bar & Grill. The coolest thing that I see about this place is the bathrooms. When you go into the bathroom it is a two-way mirror where you can see out into the bar while you're in the bathroom using the urinal. It took me a while to get used to it at first and then now it's humorous and kind of neat and in the urinal they have the biggest Rivals of the Steelers so the men can urinate on the Bengals the Browns and the Ravens which is funny. This is a bar food type environment but they do have some classy type food as well such as Italian and ribs and whatnot but always go with the classic big Bettis Burger which is about $10 and then it is a phenomenal Burger great place great prices of the food and they always have the games on. We like going on Saturday nights because there's usually a Pittsburgh Penguin game on and we watch that in the crowd and they listen to it and everybody's excited and pumped up for the Penguins. I highly recommend this place we will be back the next time we're in Pittsburgh which will hopefully be this fall and I hope everybody goes out and tries it.",

    "text": "I'm a huge Steelers fan as we left West Virginia I wanted to go to Pittsburgh before we drove back to Utah.  I found this on yelp near the field and not directly in the city so we could exit easier.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was so sweet.  I asked for a Mai Tai since I can't get them in Utah.  She was unsure how to make it so she google it and nailed it on her first shot, it reminded me of the first one I got hooked on in Las vegas.    The artichoke spinach dip was so good.  The consistency wasn't what was expected but, that wasn't a bad thing.  The spinach looked like it was wilted in the dip before being brought out.  The pork bellies were quite a wonderful addition to the dip.  I enjoyed the large chunks of artichoke.  It was very creamy and flavored well,  the salty crackers made it a great salty flavor that wasn't overpowering.  My hubby had the burger 36 and loved it.  He ate the whole plate and was making mmmm sounds.  I didn't try it so I only have his response to review but, he was quite pleased with his choice.  I had the new York strip medium rare and I didn't think I could finish it but, I dang near did.  It was so tender I hardly needed my knife.  I also judge my steaks on the seasoning without steak sauce (if I use steak sauce it's not a good thing, I don't like steak sauce, it shouldn't be needed on good steak).  The steak was seasoned well, only a little salty which I like, not overpowering but, mostly a pepper flavor which is what I love.  I couldn't pinpoint the other seasonings but, I don't care it was a wonderful steak.  The mashed potatoes were very good, a little crispy on one side like it was exposed to something hot, not sure.  The broccoli was cooked well but, had a bit to mush salt for my liking.    I would go here again just for that steak, spinach dip, and if that lovely bartender is there the Mai tai, it was worth it!",

All good. The restaurant has a lot of TV's scattered in the restaurant to watch the game while eating. Overall a fun atmosphere. We did run into an incident on last nights visit where the receptionist had penalized us by having us sit out in the wind and cold weather because my guest, I was with had a service dog with her. We spoke to our server at the end of the meal to find out if that was the normal procedure and she assured us that it was not. She spoke to the manager about it, which he apologized and spoke to the maitre d.  I would recommend the restaurant and especially the pierogies with the sour cream dip.",

    "text": "Big time Fumble   So I guess I went there on an off night.   My colleagues and I were there for dinner and while the place was say half busy it seems the front of the house was in chaos.   The waitstaff were nice but the meal really took a turn.  It seems they were badly under staffed and it shows.   So the first odd thing was our drinks we're served in plastic cups,  maybe this is a thing there or maybe they did not have enough clean glass ware?  It seems very out of place to me in what is a high brow look.   The meal took close to 40 minutes to come out and it was meh.  I ordered the chicken pasta and parts were cold, my guess sitting in the window too long.  Other dishes were a chicken club and fish tocos, none of which should've required 40 minutes. I also ordered a second drink that never came,  I'm not sure if the bartender or server dropped the ball there. The bathroom was messy, garbage over flowing, one stall had not toilet paper, another had a light out.  When I asked to see the manager I was informed that she was on the line cooking and could not come out to talk.  I did get my drink comped and left but for me, an out of town guy, what should've been a once in a lifetime experience was an experience in really meh service",

It's not always on the menu but if it is treat yourself to all the calories. The few times I've been I've had a small wait time but not but so long.",

When we arrived, the hostess was pleasant and we were seated immediately.  When we got to our booth, the seats were ripped up and had food crumbs everywhere.  We got our menus and there was also food stains on the menu! Already, it was not such a great start with the presentation of uncleanliness.  We ordered our drinks, and when the drinks arrived, our server said they ran out of straws. Ummm ok. We had other friends meeting up with us at the restaurant. When they arrived, my one friend was trying to order a drink. And the server either did not know what the drink was, or he kept saying they ran out of that particular wine.  Soooooo frustrating. Our food did arrive in a decent timeframe. I ordered the deep fried burger and fries and split it with another friend. I will say the food was good. My other friends didnt complain about the taste of their food either.  But thiis place just seems to need a lot of work in proper set up and having their products available. You should never be our of so many things. Even our ketchup bottles had no ketchup in it. We asked our server for more ketchup, which never came so we had to grab one ourselves from an empty table.  Management needs to pull this place together! They are about to send it down the drain if this keeps up.",

Located a block from Heinz Field, across the street from Stage AE and two blocks from PNC Park, not to mention right on the River Walk on the North Shore of the Allegheny River, Bettis's is an ideal spot for pre-game and pre-concert drinks and food.  Sizable out door patio section which is great during football season or just to relax and admire the fountain at Point State Park across the rivers. Inside has a few pics of the restaurants namesake, former Notre Dame and Pittsburgh Steeler Hall of Fame Running Back Jerome \"The Bus\" Bettis.  Food is pretty standard appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and some pasta dishes. I will say, one of my favorites is the Deep Fried Burger. It's a coronary waiting to happen, but it is good.  Plan on a long wait if you are there during a concert or sporting event, but Bettis's is even better if you go on an off night just to enjoy the restaurant. Regardless, you shouldn't be disappointed with your visit!",

The bar area is covered in tvs to watch sports and signed memorabilia covers the walls. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwhich. The sandwhich came fried with a nice crunchy breaded layer. Coating the chicken is a delicious spicy buffalo sauce, not overly hot, but just a good spicy kick. I also got pepperjack cheese on top, which added to the good flavor. Lastly, you can get either blu cheese or ranch on the side to dip your sandwich in or place on it. Sandwiches also come with fries, which were fresh and seasoned nicely. Prices are reasonable too, so this is a great lunch or dinner option pregame or when you're spending the day on the North Side.",

The fish tacos felt like they were missing some flavor.  The toppings helped, but the meat itself was flavorless.  It tasted like frozen fish, defrosted and heated up, then thrown on a taco shell.

It took another hour to find anyone to take an order which I just left & went somewhere else. My food was dry, cold, over cooked  & not done as I ordered it. The Jerome burger came out almost burnt, cold & missing all toppings. My other order was also cold but looked greasier than a turkey burger should. It was also missing the sweet potato fries what I got was some over seasoned old fries. Again it was done done as I expected it to be, what a big let down.  Then to top it off I pay the waiter and wait & wait for my change guess what no can find the waiter. He took off with my money, I looked for him for over half an hour for him never saw him again. Funny I was going to give him a bigger tip than wat he stole!  So if your down with terrible service, ordinary over priced food & thief for waiter then this is the place for you. I'll never waster my money again & make sure I spread the word about the thief.",

We went on a warm summer afternoon before a Pirates game to get a quick bite and of course wanted to try out Jerome Bettis place since we were in Pittsburgh and he is a classic Steeler. We sat on the patio where we had an amazing view of Point State Park, Downtown Pittsburgh and the river. My boyfriend and ordered a local beer off the menu, which the server had great knowledge about. It was served in an adequately sized glass and perfectly fulfilling for him before a sporting event. We placed our orders, getting an appetizer and two main dishes. He had the signature burger, burger 36, which was probably one of the better burgers we have had in a while. The sauce was amazing and topped everything off, we also got the Ultimate mac and cheese which was great with the bacon crumbled over the top. I got the pulled pork which was alright but I preferred his burger. We didn't go inside so I can't speak about the seating there or the bar experience but can say we certainly enjoyed ourselves on the patio even on a somewhat windy Pittsburgh afternoon.",

It's very well planned out!  Food has been pretty great for me, as a seasoned lover of American bar food.  Any place that serves a deep fried cheeseburger or italian hoagie is allright by me.  The portions are large and everything has been well-prepared every time I go.  The bar has a great selection of craft brews and liquor, but don't go by the drink descriptions written on their drink menu...I've caught them cutting costs subbing out cheaper liquors for what is labeled on the menu as premium (triple sec for Grand Marnier, for example).  Otherwise, it's a great place to sit outside and have some great bar food and a beer.    Oh and guys...make sure you check out the bathroom...the urinals have a 2-way mirror that lets you watch the bar while you pee...very unique!",

Lots of screens to watch and it's not too too hard to get a drink at the bar even when it's crowded.  The food is pretty standard; nothing great even for bar grub - fried stuff, nachos, quesadillas, wraps, sandwiches and a few fancier looking items to round out the menu.  Overall, the only time to come to Bettis' is when there's a corresponding game going on. It's a nice establishment, yes, but there are much better places around town if you want a proper meal, even by pub fare standards.",

If you're up for the challenge, try the 36....and kudos to you if you finish it.  There were a few reviews that said the food here was 'pub' style.

I ordered the Mediterranean Hummus and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. Both came with plenty of pita bread to go around. The hummus was pretty good - it was pretty much what you might expect to get ordering Mediterranean hummus. The spinach and artichoke dip had prosciutto in it, which I have never had before in this type of dip. It was delicious, but incredibly salty so I couldn't eat too much. I didn't order an entree, although the gentleman next to me had the BBQ Bacon and Cheddar Burger and it looked/smelled amazing. My mouth was literally watering as I watched him eat it.  I will definitely be back to try the Mac and Cheese and the BBQ Burger, and will update my post then.",

My friends and I got to the restaurant a little late, about a half hour before kitchen closed yet they were more than willing to take us in and serve us. Our server who's name I really wish I remembered was easily the best server I have ever experienced. He was awesome with his knowledge of the menu, beers, and the area around the bar(I'll explain later.)    We got there and were seated immediately and had our drink orders taken right away after a couple of suggestions from our server on beers. Speaking of beers, I love that the menu denotes which beers are brewed in-state. It was the last day of a weekend trip to the city so we went all out for our dinner. I got the 36 steak which was cooked to perfection. Since it was so late, the kitchen asked if they could butterfly it so it could cook faster which I totally understood and appreciated them just giving me the heads up. All my friends meals were cooked to perfection and they were thrilled with the meals.   As we talked with our server we discussed how we had been looking for a good cigar bar in the area and were told by a server in another local restaurant that there was none. Our server was baffled knowing there was one right in between Grille 36 and the other business. He went so far as to get the number of the bar and call himself to see if it was still open for us.    Overall, we were kind of skeptical with mixed reviews, but after our meal Monday night, Grille 36 will forever be remembered as one of the better restaurants I've been to with some of the best staff I have experienced.  P.S. Men should definitely check out the one way mirror in the bathroom, definitely an awesome feature.",

The menu has a pretty diverse selection of food, though most would fall into the category of \"American\".  Starting with the chips and salsa, I was excited to hear the salsa was home made. What came out wasn't exactly salsa, but more of a bowl of diced tomatoes with a sprinkling of other ingredients. Not spicy at all. Just tomatoey. Not impressed.  I had the llama burger which was the meat featured on Friday. I ordered it with the recommended Cajun mayo and sweet potato fries. it was pretty damn good. Not the best burger ever, but pretty good.  My buddy got the buffalo chicken burger which apparently was not even good enough to finish... and he always finishes.

    "text": "I went here on a Saturday night with a couple friends from out of town before hitting the bars.  Perhaps not our first choice for an authentic Pittsburgh dinner but I had a gift card so we decided to give it a try. I also didn't mind rubbing Pittsburgh sports into my Philly friends' faces.   We went during a Pens game and the place was pretty packed. We put our names in and got a drink at the CROWDED bar. The bar was definitely the sports crowd so I felt a little out of place in a \"going out\" dress.  We got a great booth with a TV in the dining area part of the restaurant.   Food: I would give the food at 7 out of 10. I got the seared tuna which was quite a large portion of high grade tuna. Spicy and delicious. It came with \"dirty rice\" which mean chunks of sausage in the rice.  Not really my style so I got pilaf instead. One of my friends got the Mahi Mahi which was really good as well. I would never order a cream base pasta but a had more than a couple bites of it (if you order something healthy but eat someone else's unhealthy meal the calories don't count, its science) and I loved it! Other friend got a typical Pittsburgh steak salad minus the fries and onion rings (she doesn't understand this Pittsburgh staple). She liked it though.   We started off with the goat cheese app. It wasn't culinary genius (goat cheese, marinara, warm bread, balsamic drizzle) but it was a good app to share and everyone liked it.   Drinks: OOOO THE DRINKS! This is where the place went from a 3 star to a 4 star. After going to Church Brew Works the day before jonesing for a cocktail and coming up empty handed because they didn't have a list, this was a great surprise. About 40 speciality cocktails. 30 Beers on tap and 30 something bottles. Got a \"healthy\" Acai drink which was nice and girly. Then followed my cocktail with a....multiple beers. Great List. Something for everyone.   Atmosphere: Not enough TVs, haha. The place was on the louder side because it was busy.  I thought drunk college kids were sitting behind us but it was actually a group of 50-somethings (classy, dad).  Overall the restaurant is beautiful for a sports bar. Definitely a tourist crowd especially with the Patriots game the next day.   Service: Our server was great. She let my picky friends move to another table in the corner.  She was very knowledgeable( I want to give her props but a forget her name...brunette pony tail).  My (gay) friend was a fan of all the cute bus boys. He insisted they only hire gay bus boys because they won't pay attention to the games (haha).    Pro: Drink list, lively restaurant, quick service even though they were busy.   Con: Bar was slammed almost like a crowded club. Some people were drunk and obnoxious ( if a had a couple more beers I wouldn't have cared).   Generally good food. solid drinks. Just really Busy!",

    "text": "Food: The menu offers pretty much exactly what you would expect Jerome Bettis himself to eat, a lot of meat and hearty sides, but also features a surprising number of vegetarian choices for a grill owned by a former NFL player as robust as The Bus.  Carnivores will have no problem finding something that sounds good on the menu, and I'm sure the food is up to par with any other steakhouse its size and scale.  Some menu items are noted with a \"36\" as \"Jerome's favorites\" (hint: Jerome does not prefer vegetables), while others are noted with a differently colored \"36\" to show that they are vegetarian.  Those items include a homemade veggie burger, gnocchi, linguini, salads, and a handful of appetizers.  We ordered the hummus, which was pretty bland and had almost no flavor.  Unlike most restaurants, which load you up on hummus and skimp on the pitas, Bettis does the opposite, providing a mound of pitas and a less hummus than you would expect.  We each ordered the homemade veggie burger, which was impressive as a concept (for this type of restaurant), but Jerome needs to talk to some of his vegetarian NFL friends (Tony Gonzalez, Arian Foster) and revamp this burger.  It had little flavor and a sloppy texture and had standard, bland toppings like onion, a massive leaf of lettuce, and a slice of tomato.  The strawberry cilantro dressing sounded great but was barely noticeable.  The best part of the meal was the huge pile of sweet potato waffle fries that came as a side.  We didn't order dessert after being underwhelmed by our dinner.  Price: Jerome has to pay the bills for this amazing location (see below), but the prices are generally fair.  This isn't a cheap meal, but not expensive either.  Appetizers range from $6-13, and sandwiches or entrees range from $10-19 (except for the $54 36 oz. steak).  The special cocktails are a little pricy but there is a full bar with cheaper cocktails and at least one beer special which is more affordable.  Drinks: The bar is the Grille's strongest feature.  There is a huge list of draft and bottled beers, an extensive wine list, a full-service bar and specialty cocktail list, and even IBC Root Beer and Red Bull.  We tried a special cocktail, The Jolly Roger, which wasn't cheap but was made strong and was pretty tasty, before switching to one of the many beer options.  Atmosphere: The restaurant aspect is pretty standard with large and small tables, indoor and outdoor seating, televisions playing sports, and music blasting.  The bar is a huge oval with many seats, a lot of fast-moving bartenders, and even more TVs playing almost any live sporting event that you'd want to see.  The entire place is littered with signed notes on the walls from former Steelers and famous athletes.  Just reading these notes, if you're a sports fan, will keep you busy throughout dinner.  If you're like me, and the Steelers are almost as important as your family, you'll want to try this place once and will probably be somewhat biased in a positive way, like the homer that you are on Sunday afternoons.  The men's restroom has the now famous two-sided mirror that looks out into the bar and front door of the restaurant, which is a unique perspective while relieving your bladder.  Due to its proximity to Heinz Field and Stage AE, the place gets super busy before a big event.  It was packed when we went, but we only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table for two.  The bar fills up quickly, but there are enough bartenders to get a drink without too long of a wait.  This is probably a good place to watch a game, but is much busier and more frantic than your neighborhood pub.  Service: Everyone was friendly and efficient, particularly the bartenders.  Despite being slammed before a concert at Stage AE, the bartenders were hustling to get everyone drinks fast.  We didn't wait long for a table, put in our order quickly, and had quick refills on waters and drinks.    (+): awesome location, plenty to drink, owned by a legendary former Steeler  (-): average food, lacks the authenticity of a smaller bar/restaurant, nothing special  Would I go back again? If I had tickets to a show at Stage AE or a game at Heinz Field and forgot beers for tailgaiting at home or it was raining, probably.  Sorry Jerome; watching highlights of thunderous runs with tacklers bouncing to the turf gives me goosebumps, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here for the generic food on just any old night.",

    "text": "This place is literally right next to Heinz Field. If you're coming here on game day, good luck getting a seat. Good luck even walking around inside. Even after the game, there's a long wait to get food and even inside the restaurant. But I mean, what do you expect when the owner is Jerome Bettis and you have a place right next to Heinz Field. I usually would take a star away for being overpacked but not here. So the last time I was back for a Steelers game, we hit this place up after pregaming hard in one of the red lots. Well. About 1.5 hrs until they opened the doors, we went to this place. I've heard quite a bit it here but never actually experienced it. We waited 30 minutes to even get inside. And once inside, it was hard to manoever aroud. I have no idea how we managed to snag a booth but we got a booth for 4 which was awesome. We ordered a plate of the nachos and a ton of beer.   Guys, you have to check out the bathroom here. It's a one way mirror. You can see out of the bathroom while peeing and see everyone else drinking oblivious to the fact that you are taking care of business and they can't see you at all.   Well. After the game, we came back for a late night dinner. The steelers won of course and everyone was really happy. The line up outside was probably about 45 minutes long but we waited 5 minutes to get inside. Here's a secret. If you say you're going to be drinking outside, you can just cut in front of everyone by walking to the outside drinking area then walk inside and a get a table.   So once we got our table for 10, we started ordering. I saw a deep fried cheeseburger and just knew that I had to get it. I mean. I probably had about 30 beers during the course of the day along with nachos, primanti brothers during half time, de luca's works for breakfast so what's a deep fried cheeseburger going to do? Might as well go all out with the calorie count. So I got the cheeseburger and figured that it would be disgusting but I had to try it. My my ... was it awesome. I have no idea how they did it but the cheese just melted in your mouth. The burger was tender and juicy and the lettuce, tomatoes and onions were not touched at all.   I am def. coming back here for game day next time but will have to get here hours in advance to get a good table.",

    "text": "Excellent example of a place that stays in business solely because of its location.  I ate at Jerome Bettis's on a college football Saturday, and it was crowded, but not packed.  Service was okay - friendly but slow.  The high point is definitely the location: can't think of a better restaurant patio in Pittsburgh.  The views of the rivers, point, and skyline are incredible.  They've got a lot of TVs, too - never a bad thing for a sports bar.  Food was abysmal.  I had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich, which I knew would be bad.  (I have yet to find good pulled pork outside of dingy BBQ places in the Southeast.)  However, I was unprepared for what came out: the sandwich had cheese on top.  Maybe I should've read the menu more closely, but it would never have occurred to me that someone would even think to put cheese on one; even my Pennsylvania-native compadres thought it was weird.  (By the way, it tasted really bad, too.  It's been a long time since I couldn't finish an entree, but I left half the sandwich.)  The other guys with me thought their food was mediocre at best, and one couldn't finish her hummus because it had a weird flavor.  (I think they used really cheap minced garlic from a jar - had that weird jar garlic flavor.)  Oh, the bathrooms are weird, too.  They have a 2-way mirror that looks out on to the street, but that means they have to keep it really dark so people can't see in.  It's basically too dark to see where you're peeing; imagine trying to hit a bullseye by candlelight.",

There were tons of items on the lunch menu but I ended up picking one that was just a little better quality than average.  My lunch buddy thought much more highly of hers so I'm willing to revisit the rating after returning for different entrees.  The service was very good although a little slow for a city lunch rush; I'll have to make sure the meeting calendar is clear for an extended lunch hour the next time.",

    "text": "Had a very poor experience there related to customer service.   Arrived to to get seating for a large table at 12:30pm.  They said they would not take names and hold tables. There were limited large tables open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so they wouldn't seat us.  We mentioned our party was expected around 1.  Around 1 they started a wait list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on it.  They had not looked to save any large tables or opportunities to hold our group and were very rude when we asked again to try and be seated.  The rest of our party showed by 1:15 and it included 3 kids. At that time, there was nowhere for us to sit.   By 2pm, they had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous.  In fact, they were very unprofessional during the entire process.  I complained to the management since they \"had no idea\" about how long it would be to try and seat us. While I waited for more than an hour, they still made no effort to hold smaller tables open to try and accommodate our party.  By just after 2pm we said we were leaving and they seemed shocked.  Was also very frustrated the manager did not really try to solve any issues and help us out.    I didn't even get to eat there but my co-workers had lunch there other days and said their meals were \"OK.\"   They need to improve their approach to seating and customer service.  If they would have been more accommodating we would have been a large party with huge orders.  Instead, they ruined our day and their reputation among a large group of potential customers.",

We ordered 5 burgers and a chicken sandwich, our food literally took 1.25 hours to come out. We were told sorry... It's been a long day.. No kidding.. Us too. Not only did the food take too long it came out wrong, cold and staggered. Again.. Burgers, how exactly does that even happen. We were so disgusted with our incredibly late, cold, wrong food that we barely ate. Who knows how long a cold burger had sat out before it made it to our table. The manager apologized for the 'kitchen dropping the ball' and comp'd our meal but... It should have been comp'd. This experience literally ruined our night as we wasted lots of time waiting then were left still hungry and in search of yet something else to eat. May be a ok place to go when it's not busy but I wouldn't count on anything if its after any kind of event. Also... Men's bathroom tries too hard to be cool and is just plain creepy.",

    "text": "I will do my best to not let the Steelers loss taint my review of the bettis grille.  This is in my estimation the best sports themed bar in Pittsburgh.  I usually swing by this place when the Steelers are playing at home, but this is the perfect place to watch a game when the steelers are away.  For some reason I always struggle with where to watch the game when the steelers are away, McFaddens is fine, guiness and all that, but the food is awful, the same can be said for calico jack's.  South side is also kind of meh' for Steeler sunday.  Bettis Grille was crowded yesterday, but not overwhelming.  I was there with about 8 people and while we only had one seat at the bar none of us had to wait for any real amount of time for a drink.  The space itself is very nice.  It has a huge football shaped bar with at least a dozen 50' plasmas with every game on.  I would characterize the food as good bar food or close to upscale casual.  I've tried many things here on muttiple visits and never been really disappointed. Yesterday we tried the burgers, which were cooked pretty well on soft buns with decent seasoning and plenty of melted cheese.  The chicken quesadillas were also adequate and the popcorn shrimp was served in style in a chinese box with plenty of veggies and ranch dressing.  They weren't overbreaded and had a nice amount of spice.  There is plenty of parking for $3 and if it's nice enough you can park a few minutes away and make the walk without the cost.  The mens bathroom is somewhat odd.  I mean it's nice enough with marble and plenty of room, but the urinals are facing a one way window out into the bar and maybe it's just me, but I findi it a bit disconcerning to think of a bunch of guys staring at whatever lady friend I happen to be with while they are doing their business.  Maybe it's just me.  I think it's a little overpriced for the booze.  I drank mostly guiness at $5 a draught, seems a little high and had a glass of wine or two for around $10.  Some of the girls ordered lemondrops for $8 a shot, seems a bit pricey, but I tend not to do candy shots myself.  Overall this is a good place and I'll definitely be back again.",

After waiting 25 minutes, we were seated.  The waitress took our drink order than came back two other times to get our food order without the drinks. I ordered the chips and salsa and it came with a large bowl of salsa with only a handful of chips.   The salsa was excellent but i ran out of chips within a few minutes and since our waitress disappeared they didnt get refilled until my meal was served.  I ordered the deep fried italian hoagie.   Like many things on the menu it sounded better than it tasted and it didnt help that we all sat there for too long with empty beer glasses.   Like this review, Bettis's was just your average sports bar with average food, but the atmosphere was cool and the outdoor seating is a plus so I am sure we will be back.  The stars are for the food only.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I just moved to Pittsburgh, all the way from Montana.  We were having lunch at Jerome Bettis Grille 36, and we asked our bartender, Matt, if there was any chance they would be showing the Montana State / Stony Brook playoff game later that night.  As Montana State alumni (Go Cats!), we are big fans, but being this far away from home, we didn't figure there was any way we would be able to see the game.  If so, our plan was to return later that evening to hang out and watch the game.  Matt went above and beyond to make sure that their AV guy, Taylor, would be able to put the game on for us.  Not only that, but Matt knew that he would be off his shift when we returned.  So he talked to the other bartenders that were coming on duty that evening - Dave, Nick, and Sean - to make sure they knew to expect us.  Sure enough, when we walked in later that evening, Dave remembered us, and had them turn the game on for us.  Not only that, but the manager on duty came up to us and asked if  everything was ok for us, and if the TV that they were showing it on was close enough.  Awesome!  PLUS, the AV guy - Taylor - stopped by where we were sitting and asked if we could see the feed clearly enough.  We definitely could.  Long story short....  The service was phenomenal!  Thank you to everyone - Matt, Dave, Nick, Sean, Taylor, and the manager on duty the afternoon and evening of 12/1/12 (sorry - we didn't get your name!).  All of you made 2 people who are a long way from home not only feel welcome, but right at home.  We are impressed, and we will definitely be back.",

The atmosphere is unique....You can do a private setting, or sit by the ample bar seating. I personally like the bar seating area. The noise level is typical of a sports bar but also creates a dining experience presence.  The food is amazing! Very generous portion sizes, a festive sports centered variety. Awesome cocktails.,..and the Bus Steak Salad is an award winner (IMO) but feel free to find out for yourself!   The wait time for seating can be tricky and on busy days quite lengthy...personally it's the only reason I gave 4 versus 5 stars. Otherwise it's an awesome place to be during a Steelers game!   Try it! The Bus does not disappoint!",

Not only is the atmosphere relaxing and welcoming, the staff is also friendly and helpful.  One personal reason that I enjoy coming is due to the extensive gluten free menu. I have a severe gluten allergy, so finding a place to eat out that is accommodating is a rarity. The grille has a separate kitchen for gluten free items, and they always come out on circular plates.  My personal favorites include the nachos, buffalo wings, and grilled chicken burger, which comes with fries! Out of all of the times that we have eaten here (too many to count) I have never gotten sick. I love this place and would recommend to anyone!  We have had many waiters, since we come here often, but George is by far the best. He is knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and helpful. He informed us about the gluten free kitchen and plates, checked up on us often, and ensured that we had our food/drinks as soon as available to him. Thank you for another great experience!",

I ate it because I was very hungry but otherwise wouldn't have. While we were eating a waiter came over and tried to serve us a beer, which we didn't order. Don't bother stopping in here.",

I ordered the veggie burger and it was just bad. It had no flavor except for the cabbage and onion and just tasted like a mushy egg roll. The server asked me why I didn't eat my dinner and I told him, yet I did not speak to a manager or get anything off my bill. The sweet potato fries were good if they weren't cold, and I got basically half the portion of my friend who got the same fries. I won't be returning.",

Your dining options around the stadium are sports bar or sports bar, so a sports bar has to be somewhat competitive. I mean, there are only so many things you can do to a burger and beer to keep folks coming back.  The atmosphere is a little more upscale and clean than most sports bars. It's definitely classier.   The menu is your basic fare - burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc. I had the nachos once expecting a typical appetizer. They should have called it \"Nacho Mountain\" it was so huge, and would have fed all 4 of us sitting at our table with no issues. Good beer selection and a full bar, although I usually just do beer when I'm there.  I've had both lunch and dinner there and the service has always been good. Nothing exceptional, but they get the job done and make me feel welcome to be there.  If you're by the ballpark and want to grab a burger but still want to impress your date, this is the place I would go to.",

The second time we went we ordered an appetizer. We got nachos. Now, I know as a server you like to add on appetizers to increase your tital. But the size of these nachos was enough to feed 6 people!

    "text": "I was here over the summer (the day the duck floated in to town!) and had a nice experience that was tempered with so-so food.  The Firecracker Popcorn Shrimp appetizer our table shared was amazing.  It was tangy and spicy and on a bed of cabbage and carrots, like a slaw but barely dressed.  I was debating between fish tacos and the deep fried cheeseburger (I mean, it's a deep fried burger, I HAD to try it) and I wish I had gone with the tacos.  Someone else at the table had them and they said they were delicious.  The burger was on its way, but I thought it could have used some tweaking.  The patty was dry and tough and the beer batter was fried to a rock-solid state, so it was hard to even cut through the thing.  Cheese was on the patty before it was battered, so it basically melted away to nothing in the fryer.  It was topped with lettuce and tomato.  Nothing amazing.  The menu says it has \"secret sauce\" but I didn't detect much of it.  I'd want something zingy to cut through the grease, like a coleslaw; something that makes everything pop and come together.  I ended up eating it with the garnish from the shrimp appetizer.  The fries were pretty good; not amazing but not just average either.  I'm not going to lie, if I'm debating between dishes and one comes with fries (or housemade chips) I'm going with that one.  The server was attentive, though you can tell very busy; even then, he checked on us frequently and didn't show signs of being rushed or frustrated with the crowd; hats off to that!  The beer list was sadly not updated; most of the seasonal pumpkin beers had just hit and were already gone, so that kinda sucked.  I know it's hard to keep up on a Friday, though.  I'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence, so perhaps your experience with the beer will be different.  Overall, it was average. Pros: shrimp appetizer, accommodating waitstaff Cons: deep fried cheeseburger, beer not well stocked",

I sampled food from a number of people's plates and was let down each time. The ribs I got were fatty and tough and the other food I tried was no better. What a let down.

I asked why, when the dining room was empty, and we were told that they were seating all of those table soon..  Only a handful of people were outside and the bar was empty.  I am sure the issue was that they were highly understaffed both from a server and kitchen perspective.  I am sure this place will be out of business once Burgatory, Toby Keith and North Park Lounge open up.  So if you want to eat there.... save your money!!!",

The menu has a large variety of American food. The most famous item on there has to be the fried burgers and sandwiches. Which means exactly how it sounds. It's a sandwich or Burger dipped in the deep fryer and served straight to you. Not for people on a diet! The environment is obviously set up like a sports bar with TV's everywhere, so it's a great place to come before or after a Steelers or Pirates game.

The service was absolutely terrible. My fiance and I sat at the bar thinking the service would be quick so we can get in and get out. Unfortunately the management here is terrible. Our server/bartender did a fantastic job and she is not to blame. On a Friday in mid summer she should have had more help. From looking around it seemed everybody was frustrated because of the lack of service. The manager was behind the bar for a few minutes not helping tho. Not sure what he was doing but he wasn't helping with orders or drinks.  Service was a lot better when relief showed up. Not sure why there would only be one bartender working on a Friday. The food was great. I had a 36 burger cooked medium rare and to my surprise it came out medium rare. Most places struggle with that for some reason. My fiance had ordered the margarita flat bread pizza in which she said was very good but not out standing. She's kinda picky so very good is about an 8 out of 10. Not gonna lie the fries sucked. Beer selection was on point food for the most part was awesome and our server was doing a great job for being alone. I tried this place because when in Pittsburg for the first time you kinda have to.

For some reason I was craving a burger, so I ordered the Bbq Bacon burger even though the Deep Fried Cheeseburger intrigued me (it's dipped in a beer batter, how could that be so bad?) I also upgraded my fries to Sweet Potato fries. I was ravenous and even though the burger was huge I ate the whole thing! And the fries were dusted with cinnamon so the smell was like having Christmas on a plate. We split a piece of Key Lime pie which was creamy and perfectly tart, but soo big we couldn't finish it. Service was wonderful, our server was on top of it and knew just when we needed something. I would come again, when in the area of course.",

Though for this neighborhood and how long they've been going at it, Bettis has a restaurant he can be proud to put attach his name.  My co-workers were all excited to go to McFadden's as it was close to PNC Park, but I saw the 2-star Yelp review average and said no thanks.  Ended up just down the street at Jerome's Grille 36.  The service is generally good, the food is actually edible.  Had a great burger, wonderful fries and lots of drink refills.  Only negative was some fruit flies at the bar.  The bathrooms are a total trip.  Funky lighting, super dark.  Like you're on a drug trip.",

My husband works on the North Shore so we were looking for more lunch options other than SoHo because it is a bit expensive there. We ordered the same items that we had ordered at SoHo the day before and noticed they were a few dollars cheaper. So far, so good. However, when we got them, we realized why. We got a chicken caesar salad and a turkey avocado sandwich. The quality is mediocre and the taste isn't the best. The quality of the meat was definitely lower than we were expecting and overall, it didn't seem worth it. However, the service and ambience were great! I could see us coming back before or after a game or concert, though!",

I Hate to say this because I love the Bus, but it was by far the worst service I've had in over ten years. Waiter never brought us all of our drinks. In fact, after he took our order, he never came back. He literally passed our table no less than 12 times without stopping or coming near us.   The poor people from the back brought our drinks and food. They looked swamped while the servers and hosts hung out.  We finished our food, which was obviously sitting under a warmer for a decent period of time, and waited 15 minutes before stopping someone else to please have our waiter bring us a check. The wait staff was obviously more concerned about hanging out than doing their job. It was horrendous. It's a shame as I had such high hopes.

Coming from Cali on a red eye not even 12 hours ago we were starving so we made a decision and it was a great one. It is literally a 10min walk from the field and the menu is extensive. Lots of tvs were playing NCAAF and not bad pricing for the food which was very tasty. There are alot of signed plaques from athletes and celebrities as well as Steelers history glad we came in! #HereWeGo",

Only three of the four of us got their food.... but no silverware. We were told that the missing food would be five minutes.... lol... we were already done our meals and check on the table .... waiting for the boxed meal ( my friend had given up and left ). They obviously hadn't bothered to prepare his meal. I think to top things off, we never got a visit from a manager. In addition to the bad food and lousy service, I was overcharged on my credit card, luckily I resolved the issue through my card service. With all the choices available on the North Shore... I certainly won't go back to this dump",

    "text": "Maybe there would be another star if I had actually gotten to eat my dinner at the restaurant.   We picked this place because we were staying in the area and their menu had a variety of items.  We ordered one gourmet Mac n cheese, an 8oz sirloin, and a burger.  The food showed up about 25 minutes later, after we waved down the puzzled looking person holding what appeared to be our order.  The side of broccoli ordered with the mac consisted of two small pieces. With the steak, which was supposed to be served with 'seasonal vegetables' - a squash medley, was served with a crown of broccoli.  Not cut apart or anything, and barely cooked. Unfortunately it was served to someone who can't eat broccoli and was expecting the vegetable that was listed on the menu. The seasonal veggies were a mushy mess of onions, peppers, and a few pieces of zucchini. Not a great start.  The person who delivered the food went back to request a different veggie for the steak. We disintegrated let him take the rest of the plate, which ended up being a good thing because it gave us a chance to check the steak.  Steak was ordered medium well, sight pink. What came was tough, burnt, and brown all the way through. Finally flagged down a waiter and sent back the steak plate. The only thing on the plate that seemed correct was the sweet potato fries  The manager came and apologized, promising an 8-minute wait. 15 minutes later, after everyone else was done, we still didn't have a steak. Flagged down the waiter (where was he????) and asked for the check. After the check arrived (excluding the missing steak), a to go box arrived with the steak. We left and headed for the hotel.  Cut into the steak, and it was barely medium - really red throughout - after a 20-minute walk in a hot box. There were some greasy, limp green beans, and sweet potato fries coated in sugar. Yuck! The first set of fries didn't have any sugar. It feels like their cooks have no idea what's on their menu, nor do they cook anything consistently. Microwaved the steak - gross, I know, but when you're hungry, you do crazy things. Threw out almost all of the veggies/fries and about half the steak (chewy/gristle). Not sure that was better than cereal from the hotel. Sigh...",

Pittsburgh was our home town for 40 years and we  wanted to share with our grandsons our home town and  the Steeler Nation. George and Jerome Bettis grill 36 only added to a perfect Steeler win and a wonderful weekend in Pittsburgh.

Even when the place isn't slammed, the service staff are fairly lackadaisical in checking in on you, and there was one instance where I was seated at a dirty table.  Now, the thing about this place is, even with the inconsistent service, for the location, the prices and the food are really good.

Anything that could go wrong, did.  We waited three hours wait to be seated and served. When the food finally arrived, nearly all of the orders were wrong and the food was cold.  We had three orders that didn't arrive at all. One person ordered the kale salad - spinach was served instead with no explanation. One person ordered a pulled pork sandwich, only to be told they were out of pork - not at the time of ordering but instead  nearly two hours later when the other orders were being served.   Fish tacos came in lieu of fish and chips, three burgers were presented, but the servers couldn't identify the differences between the orders.  The scene was incredible and we asked to talk to the manager.   She was calm, as were we, but she wasn't incompetent able to problem-solve or explain what was happening.   The manager and severs were embarrassed and abandoned our table for the rest of the night.  The night was a total disaster. Don't go! So many better restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

We got seated right away, we had a party of six. A waiter, who never even introduced himself, came up and said that their dishwasher had broken and they needed to wait for glasses. After 15 minutes he brought out 4 waters, all in plastic cups, and didn't even realize he forgot two. Right then and there we placed our order for 3 alcoholic beverages, 2 sodas, an appetizer, and 6 meals. 10 minutes after placing our order the waiter told us 2 of our drinks were unavailable, it took 15 for him to bring out all of the drinks. After this we did not see him until 45-50 minutes out when he asked if everything was okay. We had no appetizer, everyone's drinks were empty, and we still didn't even have silverware. He went into the kitchen and made up our appetizer himself, chips and queso, frankly it tasted as if he didn't even heat it up because it was hard and cold. We eventually got our food 10 minutes after this and it came out cold. Don't make people wait almost an hour for cold food. Definitely a mistake choosing to eat here and I definitely won't be doing it again",

    "text": "Terrible experience yesterday Dec 27.  Arrived at Bettis' at about 1:25 pm.  (Know this because paid to park for 90 min at meter at 1:20). We had a group of six including 74 year old disabled mother and my brother's family visiting from Florida.  Not crowded at all as it was mid-afternoon on a Tuesday.  There was only one group in front of us , yet we waited over fifteen minutes to be seated and this despite the fact there were empty tables available on the riverview side.  Hostess claimed they didnt have enough servers in that section, so we had to wait for someone to leave on the streetside.  After viewing a quick table top wet towel smear, we were finally seated at that table.   Noticed that the carpeted floors were disgusting throughout the room...food all over them.  After almost 10 min the waitress breezed by us and said \"i'll be right with you\".  Never saw her again.  After another 10 minutes a couple from next table advised, \"you seem like nice people...take our advice and get out while you can.\"  They said that they had long wait on a table, long wait to place order, long wait to get food, no service after food arrived, and yes, even a long wait to get their check.  They had been there well over an hour and a half. We thanked them and decided to leave.  Another table saw us leaving and they too left.    As we were leaving, a young man appeared and asked what he could offer us to stay.  He began providing rationalizations as to why the service was so poor and actually followed me all the way to the door asking if we wanted a different table.  We asked if we could get better service, to which he had no response.  He then actually offered us coupons for our next visit.  Really?  We came in for a meal, not charity.   Won't be visiting again.    We had an excellent customer service experience across the street at Burgatory.   BTW, thanks to the Bettis team, i also had to leave that meal to go back out to the car to feed the parking meter.",

The cheeseburger probably would have been really bad if it had not been DEEP FRIED (I feel like I have to capitalize because it was really good).  I believe I will eat everything DEEP FRIED for the rest of my life as soon as they make a difibulator smaller than my iPod Nano  The food was good - $8-23 for entrees The atmosphere was okay (it was really quiet but I blame the economy) The drinks were good   I say support your teams and your businesses.   I will go there again (and try the DEEP FRIED Hoagie - yes they have one of those too :-)) on my way to my meeting with Jenny Craig  Enjoy!",

She informed me they had a gluten free menu! I was ecstatic that they had gluten free buns. I ordered a burger with the gluten free bun. We finally got our food and when I got mine I asked again if it was gluten free, the waitress confirmed yes. After I ate half the burger I was suspicious of the bun since it tasted too good. I asked the waitress again and she had it remade. It came back on a completely different bun. The one I received first was NOT gluten free. I immediately knew I was going to be sick. I told the waitress and she apologized. I got my bill and she still charged me for the burger. I honestly didn't eat any of the new burger because I felt so sick. After I explained to the waitress I thought it was ridiculous that I had to pay for a meal that I ate half of and was going to make me sick for days, she took it off. Just disappointed that they advertise gluten free buns and can't even make sure they give the customers the right ones.",

    "text": "So.....Jerome Bettis Grille 36....it is what it is (or trying to be) - an upscale sports bar.  I made my first stop here before a Pirates game on a rainy evening.  There were good things and bad, but after reading other reviews and marinating on my own experience, I'm landing on 3 stars.  I'd give an extra half star if I could.   I don't know why exactly I thought it wouldn't be crowded.  Sure, it was a Saturday evening.  And yeah, okay, the Pirates were playing at home.  But the weather wasn't great and I'm pretty sure there were more people here than at the game I went to later.  However given other North Shore restaurant options, this is probably the best.    Not that I hated it at all.  As I stood around with my friends waiting for a table, we watched many tasty looking dishes taken into the dining room.  I was tempted to start grabbing bites as the plates were carried past by unassuming waiters.  Needless to say, we were kind of hungry.  So when a few seats opened on the bar side, we decided to sit there and avoid a long wait for a table.  To hell with civility.  Our waitress, once we established who would be taking our order, was very friendly.  Our drinks were never empty and she helped us navigate through some of the choices on the menu.  (Originally I thought about ordering two dinners just because I couldn't decide.)  I ordered Our Ginormous BLT Double Grilled Cheese Ranch Burger - recommended by our waitress above the deep fried burger.  She said what I got was her favorite, but by the looks of her, she didn't eat too many of them.  We also ordered the Deep Fried Pretzels and Buffalo Shrimp Wontons for appetizers.  My friends also ordered from the burger options.  The Deep Fried Pretzels were pretty good, but the Buffalo Shrimp Wontons were pretty stellar.  My burger was just okay, mostly because I ordered it medium and it was charred.    Overall, though, we had a pleasant experience.  Great service and reasonable prices for good food.  And because I only ordered one entree, I will be back to try the others I resisted in ordering the first time.",

Any time I go, I am content.  Food is good, nothing amazing that makes me want to come back for me, but things are always cooked as asked and the staff is always nice and friendly.  No complaints there.   If you are going to an event in the North Shore area, this is one of the better places to go in that area.  Beats a lot of the other options!",

We hit it right before a Pirates game, sat outside, and put up with slow service.  The food and drinks were good enough, although hamburgers came with and without specific fixings.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but might have to use the men's room.",

I sat at the bar, while the bartender kicked her leg up on the ice container and waited more than patiently for her to acknowledge me. From there, she proceeded to never give me the water I asked for in accompaniment with my drink and messed up my food order. The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because their sweet potatoes fries are the best I have ever had!!! The mixture of cinnamon and sugar they are baked in is heavenly. You also can't go wrong with their mini pierogis. Deep fried pierogis topped with caramelized onions and scallions. Also, delicious!",

    "text": "I've been here twice and both times were just awful. The food here is mediocre at best, especially for the price. The first time the service was decent but the Mac n cheese and the wings were completely underwhelming. Yesterday, the service was horrendous and the food was absolutely disgusting. We had the loaded nachos with chicken and guacamole and everything about it was just bad. Cheap, cold dollar store chips, chili that tasted like cheap $1 a can, mystery-meat hot dog chili, the \"pulled chicken\" was ice cold, had zero seasoning or taste and had a texture as if it had been sitting in a pan of water for hours on end. There was almost no cheese on them and the guacamole was obviously pre-packaged crap as well. To top it off, the nachos EVENTUALLY came to our table sitting in a pool consisting of what I guessed was undrained lettuce water and chicken \"juice\" and we're soggy. The Romaine for the Cesar salad wasn't drained so there was also a pool of Caesar flavored water at the bottom of the bowl. Service was beyond terrible and everyone around us was complaining. The couple next to us eventually got up and left. I spent years in the food service industry as a server so I am very forgiving of bad service, rarely complain and have never stiffed a sever even for bad service, but I did today. Manager comped our entire meal including drinks so that was cool, but still not worth the headache. I'd rather pay for good service and food than have what we had for free. Sorry, Jerome. I love ya but your place is not worthy of your name.",

    "text": "It has an outstanding location between Heinz field and PNC Park.   I thought this might be a tourist trap type of place.  But loved Jerome Bettis as a player and decided to go just the same.  The food was very good and the prices were not bad considering its location.  Let me just say this; don't eat here if you are not very hungry.  As one Steeler wrote on the wall, \"You can tell this is a big guy's place!\"  That sums it up the portions are very large and most of the food is not very good for you.  I even saw a deep fried hamburger on the menu (not kidding).  We got the nachos for an appetizer and could have stopped right there.  It was the biggest nacho appetizer I have ever seen in a restaurant. My wife and I both got different salads which were wonderful but we could not finish because of the nachos.  The kids got cheeseburgers which they could not even eat half of.  The seats are comfortable and there are flat screen televisions everywhere you look.  We saw that several of the booth tables had their own TVs too.  The only negative was that there is no parking expect for the lot across the street and price to park there varies depending on the day and what is going on around that location.  Parking can vary from $5 to $25.",

My family and I used to go here all the time- absolutely loved it but won't go back after today. We walked in with several open tables outside & inside & were told that there was a 30-45 minute wait. When we were confused about the wait, the staff answered rudely. Also, the restaurant was very under staffed and we're having kitchen issues. Extremely disappointed & won't be wasting my money here again. All of the new restaurants coming around that area soon will put Bettis' out of business and honestly not saddened about it.",

My husband had heard of this place before, and tour guide on Gateway Clipper reco'd it. We ended up driving around the downtown area but a lot was closed, so we circled back around to Grill 36. It was almost empty, so the service was friendly and fast. Good upscale pub menu, lots of TV's playing sports, good beer selection. We had nachos as an app- amazing. The queso was def house made, as was the chili. For mains, kids devoured mac and cheese, pulled pork sliders, and chicken tenders (the real meat kind!). Fries were hot and crispy. Hubs has farmyard burger - topped with OE egg; said it was amazing. I had pan fried chicken, which was lightly breaded, and served with bacon cream gravy, garlic mashed red skins, and asparagus. It was FANTASTIC. Table next to us had wings that smelled amazing. Server told us 95% of their items are made in house, and you could tell. Thoroughly enjoyed Grill 36.",
