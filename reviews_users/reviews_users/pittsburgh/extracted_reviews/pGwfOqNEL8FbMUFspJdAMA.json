    "text": "Completely blown away by the service. I don't claim to know what a typical experience at Patron is like, but I think this place deserves a glowing review for how they handled the large birthday dinner we thrusted on them.   + We had a reservation for around 20 people, and while I promise we are each wonderful as individuals... we can border on obnoxious when together as a group. Luckily, they seated us in a secluded corner of the restaurant at long chain of adjacent tables that managed to fit everyone. They are not low on space here. + As people trickled in over the course of maybe 40 minutes, the servers let us take our time to order and were incredibly patient. + Constant supply of chips and salsa is dangerously addictive. We never even needed to ask for more; they would just restock as we finished them.  + Food came out in a very reasonable time, with delicious and hearty portions for all. Honestly, after all the chips, my boyfriend and I were able to split a Patron Fajita for one and it was completely satisfying. + Servers were always polite, whether asking how things were or gently nudging in to take plates away. They also brought extra tortillas, extra plates, hot sauce when we asked. + Very accommodating for dietary restriction changes to meals. + They were able to split the check for each person like absolute WIZARDS (even accounting for items like margarita pitchers split 6 ways). That alone is pretty amazing, if you've ever been through the awful math of bill-splitting in huge groups. + Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Overall, it's such a fun place, and I personally loved the service and food. For a large group of friends or family, I highly recommend it! Four and a half stars. :)",

    "text": "This review is going to encompass a couple of visits over the years. More specifically the past 2 years of Cinco de Mayo visits.   Patron is a local Mexican chain with 4 locations around Pittsburgh, the newest being the local I will be talking about in East Liberty on the corner of S. Highland and Center Ave.  PIttsburghers never miss a chance to indulge in lecherous behavior and Cinco de Mayo at a Mexican place is no different, even on a Tuesday. My girlfriend and I had made plans to attend Patron yesterday as we had last year right when it opened its doors and pretend to be stereotypical. We made plans for 7pm, which understandably is prime time and we expected a wait, so in anticipation of events I called to add my name to the list ahead of time to cut down on the wait. The hostess must have stepped away as on of the other staff took to the phone [first bad sign]. In broken English I was told of the 1-1.5 hour wait [hence calling 45 minutes early] and I said to add my name to the list. Upon arrival I went to check on where I was in line, just to discover that my name had never been added to anything and that we were back in the queue [1 star for that]. However, we had done this last year also and it was lovely outside so we decided to wait anyways.   In anticipation of the wait, Patron had set up a front bar where you would be able to have house margaritas or beers while you wait [good redemption]. While we waited we observed the hostess staff where at one point 4 people were standing debating who to seat next. The process was fully manual and groups came and left in droves so crossing outs and addings were happening left and right. We thought this quite inefficient, the same remark we made in 2014. [however that was about a week after their grand opening so we let that slide]. The waiting area, similar to the rest of the restaurant is colorful and ethnic and airy. Very pleasant. After about an hour we were given a booth in the back.  Now the real wait began. For about 7-10 minutes we sat until a busser appeared to bring us salsa and a basket of chips. Our hungry selves immediately delved into these and soon found ourselves thirsting for water. However, no waiter was in sight. After about another 15 minutes rather than a waiter appearing we were greeted by the manager who brought us more chips and salsa and finally flagged down exhausted looking teen so take our beer orders. [Beer works for thirst too but water would have been nice too] Those finally arrived 10 minutes later with surprise! more chips. We observed the neighboring tables who were in similar pain. Nobody to help them along in the process of anything. We kept our eyes out for our frantic waitron who continuously disappeared into a black hole. When we did see him he was frazzled and sweating and busy... with... I actually couldn't tell you. We finally flagged him down to ask for food orders. One side of guac, one Fajita Chesadilla and an Enchilada Carnitas.   Finally. Progress... until the waiter came back and asked if the Enchiladas would be with chicken or beef.... um... carnitas. ... Know you menu.   Eventually waters appeared, which was fantastic at that point in time. While waiting for our food, the waitron checked on us apologizing profusely for a backed up kitchen. hm... They sat a table next to us who had eventually just abandoned the process because of no service. [Not the kitchen's fault]. In attempts of cleaning abandoned menu I finally understood how the service was slow. Waitron would do one thing then run back then come out do a single thing and then return to the waitron station... no dear... you made 3 trips for something that could have been 1. This is why you don't hire new meat right before you busy drinking days.... especially when they are 18 and don't know any better. [1 star for this]  To the actual food. It was good. 0 complaints there. By the end of the evening we had been there for 3 hours for an entire meal. [which was good and still decently warm when it arrived] Even the complimentary shot of tequila was not a good remedy for this. and $25 a person.... i guess that's $8 and hour... [1 star for this]  Understandably, we half knew what we were getting ourselves into for the wait outside which is why this doesn't have a single star rating. Also they had a live jazz[ish? band we couldn't figure out what the trumpet player was doing] band playing which was nice, just a little bit [very] loud.  We will be moving our Cinco de Mayo festivities somewhere else next year.",

    "text": "I haven't ever wanted to come here in the past simply because Mexican food in Pittsburgh has largely been a letdown for me, but I recently went for the Monday night $1 taco/$3 margarita special at the behest of my roommate and it was a decent enough experience. The atmosphere was very open, airy, and colorful. It definitely bordered on the kitschy, but most Mexican restaurants that aren't in California seem to be that way. (The decor reminded my roommate and me of the TexMex places we ate at on a spring break trip a few years back.) The staff was friendly, albeit a little scattered and spread thin. Our server was new, so I can't really comment on him properly.   The house chips and salsa we started with were free (a huge plus!) and quite delicious. The salsa lacked the complexity of Verde's, but it didn't cost any money so I can't complain too much. Once we ordered the rest of our food it came very quickly. I tried the chicken taco and the margarita. Only the hard shell tacos are $1 on Mondays which honestly should have been advertised since it caused some confusion, but a lot of that could have been due to our green server not explaining the deal to us at all. The taco was delicious and fairly simple...just shredded chicken fried with green and red peppers and onions. It was topped with lettuce, and they also offer cheese if you want. I'd eat it again but only on Mondays for $1. The margarita was clearly made from a mix, so I wouldn't waste my money on it if I ever came back here. (Margaritas aren't that hard to get right!) They have pretty decent beer prices, so I could see myself going that route in the future. Overall Patron is a solid place to get some very cheap tacos during a non-happy hour time of night with lots of available seating, so I give it three stars for that. Better margaritas would have been nice, but for $3 I suppose that's just too good to be True!",

Our waitress was nice enough and started us with a good portion of chips and salsa. We went for the fajitas for two, and after just a short while an overly huge platter of grilled food came out. The iron pan was chock full of onions, peppers, meats, and shrimp, and everything was quite flavorful. It also came with two separate plates of rice, beans, guac, and chopped veggies with sour cream, all of which were good. Along with the tortillas, all of this turned out to be way too much food for two people. So all in all, it was a pretty good value.",

    "text": "Having just moved from Austin not too long ago, I was very much missing out on decent Tex/Mex in Pittsburgh. Mad Mex is... well its good, but its not even in the same genre. Lets just say, Chipotle was a welcome site - and that's hardly Mexican, either.  I was very excited to have this place open up in my neighborhood. Until I tried it.  Lets start with the good: * Decent salsa * Good guacamole (a pleasant surprise) * Warm tortilla chips * A nice clean, mildly-tacky-but-appropriately-so atmosphere  Now, the rest: * Margaritas were TERRIBLE. I'm sorry, you can't charge me $10 for a margarita and use a MIX in it! Are you kidding? Simple recipe: Tequila, fresh lime juice, cointreau or Patron Citronge or Gran Marnier or Paulas Texas Orange. This is not hard to do right. * Crispy shells everywhere on the menu. * No breakfast tacos offered * Veggie options were strange. Broccoli? Cauliflower? WHAT? Why not calabacitas? Sweet potato, grilled corn, rajas, nopales, caramelized onion, Mushrooms... Huitlacoche? So many better options than a salad bar shoulder shrug. * Limited salsas. No mole or tomatillo.  So, basically, this place has potential - but its going to take a complete menu/recipe/bar revamp before I'll consider returning.",

However, the food was a huge flop.  First, I had the red sangria (which was so so) and my boyfriend had a classic margarita on the rock, which tasted like a mix out of some plastic jug.  Truly awful.  Then the chips & salsa arrived.  The chips were unremarkable but the salsa (which was pureed and runny) was clearly out of a jar.  Nothing tasted fresh.  The menu was so huge there's no possible way anything is fresh or from scratch.  I don't see this place surviving long in the shadyside neighborhood.   In summary, I'd rather eat at Chipotle.  And that says alot.",

However, I was super disappointed when I visited this time. This place used to have the best homemade margarita's & guacamole around Pittsburgh. Not the case anymore! The margarita I got tasted like it came from a grocery store bottle. The guacamole was definitely not the chunky, homemade stuff that I have had before at this restaurant. It was smooth and blended up, like the stuff you get out of the grocery store premade packages. It didn't even have any cilantro in it. I think I'VE MADE BETTER guacamole than this! The chips seemed like they came from a bag too. I was so disappointed.  I got my usual menu item, the shrimp chimichanga, it was not as much of a disaster as the rest of the food and drinks where, however I could take it or leave it. My friends & I will unfortunately will not be back! What happened to this place????",

I got 2 chicken and 1 beef with both the red and green sauce. It wasn't all that great the red sauce was better than green and the protein was 'whatever.'   Also their menu was a little bit confusing. It was ridden with typos and errors so some of the items on the menu didn't make any sense and had to be clarified by the waiter.   I wouldn't come again...I would probably go to Las Palmas for some yummy tacos.",

Closest had to be los cabos in lawrenceville but you order at a front counter so it didn't have that authentic restaurant feel. I was SOSO excited when I saw that a new Mexican place was coming!   First impression was that this place is huge! Could easily get lost. The chips were good, salsa was pretty tasty, always a plus. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my husband got the enchiladas supremas. Everything was pretty good. My portion was huge and quite tasty, enough to take home. The reason I'm deducting one star is that in our favorite Mexican restaurant in my husband's home town, most entrees are served with rice, beans, guac, pico, and sour cream. Here, very few entrees came with those fixins for what was still a relatively pricey meal. Very tasty otherwise and we'll definitely be back!",

Their large draft beers are a full 32 oz, just so you know what you are ordering.  It looks a bit comical, but it works out great if you love beer.",

It's the only restaurant in the area that was empty, dead! Every time I drive past the place, it looks vacant.  The food was served super fast, and the wait staff was very attentive.  I would give both 5 stars.  The problem is the taste of the food.  I found the meals to be very bland and unremarkable.  My try once more for the specials mentioned in the other posts.",

Patron is that, and it does it perfectly. Tons of vegetarian options, great happy hour specials (7 dollar giant margaritas on Saturdays!), and very friendly service which occasionally is lacking up the street with the tattoo crowd.",

The server was extremely nice and attentive. I was famished and he got us out chips and salsa pronto. The cheese dip was also quite yummy. I got a cheese quesadilla--it was simple but hit the spot. My husband got the fajita quesadilla--it was great. Keep in mind not to overeat on chips as the portions are large here.   The restaurant was pretty empty but we went during an off time. The margaritas looked pretty good. The table next to us got two and my mouth was watering (darn you baby). They have a nice bar area and TVs available.",

It's also a little more expensive than I think it should be. The upside to that is that the portions are big and you'll definitely be full when you walk out.   They start you out with chips and salsa, which are pretty good. If you order the guacamole then someone will come to your table and make it right in front of you. It isn't really a new idea, but I think it's a good one. I got the chicken chimichanga. It was amazing! My only complaint is that it wasn't larger. They give you a large portion in sides...stuff like lettuce, salsa, guac, rice, beans. I would recommend it for anyone looking for good Mexican food in Pittsburgh.",

They also had a soccer match on a big screen which my BF enjoyed.   Our server was very nice and prompt. He answered all of our questions and brought everything without delay. They give free chips and salsa which is nice but pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant. We also ordered the queso, which is no-frills but delicious. Our waiting was quick on refilling our chips.   BF had one of the combo platters which was HUGE and tasty but not something to write home about. I had the three chicken tacos. At $5, it was a great deal. The tacos were good but the shredded iceburg lettuce made them a bit watery. I liked the cheese that was on them and it was plentiful. The flavor of the chicken was also good.   We didn't have drinks so I can't comment on that. The cocktails looked large from what I saw at other tables.   Overall a good meal, and reasonably priced. I'll stick with my local place but Patron was nice in a pinch.",

Patron has much more variety and everything I've had has been super good. I was a little worried about the bad Yelp reviews, but one try was all it took to change my mind.   I've been here three times now, twice with my boyfriend and once with friends. Their margaritas are awesome, especially if you get one made with one of the premium tequilas off of their pretty impressive tequila list. The sangria is also nice and fruity and is pretty strong - none of that watered down stuff!   The guacamole Patron is also delicious. I'm so glad I found a Mexican place that does guacamole right! Plus, there's unlimited chips and salsa, so you're not left with a whole bunch of guac and nothing to eat it with.   I've now tried the chimichanga, the enchiladas, and the chicken fajitas - all excellent, though probably not so excellent for my waistline. I also always have enough leftovers for a good sized lunch the next day.  All of the servers I've had have been extremely attentive and helpful, and the manager even stopped by a few times to ask us how everything was. I'll definitely be back!",

I had a chile reileno and a beef taco with a side of refried beans and my husband had a beef fajita burrito.  Both of our meals were tasty, spiced well and very fresh.  We moved here from southern California and spend at least 2 months in the winter in California so we eat a lot of Mexican food and this food was as good as what we get in California.  I read the critical reviews about the Margaritas and found my Margarita to be quite good.  It was tangy tasted fresh and had enough salt on the glass to suit my taste.  We were also happy that valet parking was available because, as those who live in Pittsburgh know, parking in this city is a problem.",

I ordered the chile relleno, and nachos with black beans. My BF ordered chicken fajitas. The presentation was very poor(see pictures). The chile wasn't good. The chicken was tasteless and it was smothered in some type of white sauce that was also tasteless. Maybe if it was in a red sauce and the chicken had more flavoring (which I expected), it could have saved the dish - I actually tossed the majority in the trash. The bean nachos were good after I added shredded cheese on top from my fridge and the fixings from the fajita that I stole from my BF. The nachos came with a questionable sauce, beans, and chips (no sour cream, lettuce, pico, etc).   My BF thought the taste of the fajitas was okay... but the chicken was cut very oddly (small slivers). Didn't look very appetizing.  Don't think I'll return or recommend to others.",

Overall it's a fun place to go after work. The main reason why I don't go on other days of the week is because I feel the normal priced entrees are expensive. Not necessarily expensive for the neighborhood, just expensive for Mexican food.",

The tacos are hard shell and you can choose between chicken and beef. Then for margaritas you can choice between having it frozen or on the rocks. If you want to choice a flavor of margarita it's $1 extra and I'd recommend the blue mango or the raspberry!

This location is larger than it looks from the outside; there are quite a few different sections of seating. Therefor it's perfect for large groups. We went here for dollar taco night and happy hour. Only the hard shell tacos are $1. I don't like hard shell so I got soft and paid $2.50 each. The flavor was pretty bland, and one of my tacos had a chunk of meat that was not cooked all the way through. My friends come here a lot so I'm sure that I'll be back hopefully trying something different and tasty.",

They also only come in two options, beef or chicken. There was nothing exceptional about either, but I definitely liked the beef one more than the chicken one. In terms of size, the tacos were not smaller just because of the price (as my friend feared). They were reasonable servings and I'd say 3 is good for a meal (unless you're starving).   The interior is really well-decorated and not something you would expect based on the restaurant exterior. There also wasn't that big of a crowd for the $1 special. Overall, I'm a fan of the $1 deal but not so much for the actual tacos..",

Monday's are 3$ Margaritas at patron, so it is extremely crowded.  Usually there will be a 20-30 minute wait. After we did manage to wait, we were seated and the service was extremely slow. We were halfway through our entree but the Margaritas weren't out yet. So we ended up cancelling them. We had ordered the shrimp tacos, but found the shrimp to be uncooked and the vegetables quite raw so ended up returning this.  When I have been here on other days, patron is less chaotic. The food quality was definitely better, and the service was good. Certainly the food is more authentic, compared to Mad Mex. Even the drinks are better by a notch. Patron is certainly not a completely authentic Mexican place, but is more of a family friendly Tex Mex place, with a couple of more dishes than an average one, coupled with a good selection of drinks.",

You get 4 enchiladas, each of them filled differently. One with chicken, ground beef, cheese and a bean filling. The chicken was definitely my favourite as it had the right amount of everything.

Patron had me at free chips and salsa. The salsa turned out to be bland and watery, but I can't really complain about a freebie. The Wednesday special is $3.50 chimichangas (original price is $5 so not that much of a discount). Since I've never had a chimi before, I decided to go for it. The vegetarian chimi is basically a tortilla stuffed with refried beans then smothered in queso. It was awful. I gave them my hard earned money to eat a pile of mushed up beans. Everything they served tasted like it came straight from a can.   Before I rip this place apart further, I want to note that the staff were phenomenal. Truly the silver lining to an otherwise unpleasant experience. Our waiter was very friendly and cheerful. He checked in on us often and was very efficient when it came to refilling our waters and chips. That guy is the real MVP.",

It was a brown and white mess with no veggies, rice, salsa etc. I asked for some veggies and the waiter brought over a \"salad\" (shredded lettuce with a little pico and guacamole) which he later charged for and gave attitude about. No one at our table finished their meal, most barely eating half.

It was a busy night so our food took a while, but the waitress kept us stocked with plenty of chips and salsa while we waited.  I'm not super adventurous when it comes to Mexican food, so I just stuck with the cheese quesadilla. The flavor was good, but the cheese was only partly melted, and some of it was cold. I assume it had to do with the kitchen being busy, but overall I'd call my dinner just okay.",

Our waitress quickly brought out chips and salsa for our table. I really liked that each person was given their own small bowl of salsa instead of just one large communal bowl. We quickly ate both baskets of chips, but our waitress immediately brought us more. We were all satisfied with our meals as well. I ordered a meal with chicken on a bed of rice and queso poured over the top which was scrumptious! A friend of mine ordered the shrimp fajitas which looked amazing! I will definitely try Patron again the next time I am in Shadyside!",

They provide large portions and a friendly wait staff. The decor is bright and colorful, typical of a Mexican restaurant. I love how they will serve everyone their individual salsa container to dip in.   I ordered the pork tamales but they were out of pork and I had to settle for chicken. The verde sauce that it came with was really delicious and authentic. I was served so much rice and beans that I didn't have an appetite to finish it all.  I came for lunch and was served and greeted all in a timely manner. There wasn't loud music or anything too distracting so we were able to have a working lunch conversation. I'll definitely come back to try the dinner menu.",

    "text": "Festive Mexican food place.  There aren't many Mexican places in Pittsburgh, so Patron has a decent rep. However, their menu is crazy, and they don't execute their dishes as well as you'd expect.  Table guacamole is always good, but they aren't too generous here. I loved the strong acidic lime touch to the guac, more than other places do, but I felt that the supporting cast of the diced veggies fell short.  As for the entrees, everything was pretty standard. The meat was pretty mediocre, except for maybe their ground beef, which I enjoyed a lot---until it got too salty. Their steak mexicano was a total disappointment---just a really thinly sliced and cheap tbone cut.   The fish was surprisingly good, so I have to give a thumbs up to that. However, all the surrounding elements: rice, beans, veggies...weren't great either. They felt more like filler than part of the meal.  Overall, pretty average place. Everything else about the place is decent. The food just falls short.",

I would have just liked a sauce or something to add more flavor. As there are so many places in Pittsburgh for good tacos and drinks, I don't know if I would be back.

I ordered the chicken chimichanga off the a la carte menu ($5) and my friend had the veggie fajita ($14?) and a $25 margarita pitcher for the table, we both could not finish our meals. Patron's does a good job of filling up its patrons with free chips and salsa. Everyone gets their personal salsa bowl and every two people share a basket of tortilla chips. These alone are pretty filling. Adding a $2.50 side of guacamole and our individual orders, we ended up bringing our leftovers home! The drink wasn't too strong but wasn't overtly sweet either. The food wasn't fantastic, but was filling and savory. It was a good combination and experience.  I want to come here to try their $1 tacos and $3 margaritas on Mondays! But I definitely know that this place is one for quantity not quality. It's an affordable place to fill your stomachs.",

They have a vegetarian bean taco which is kind of wimpy and comes with a hard shell- I think soft shell tacos are more authentic and tastier so would prefer those if given the option. The chips and salsa they give out for free is pretty good, though! If you take advantage of this deal make sure to tip your poor waiter well-they get swamped on Monday nights and still have to carry tacos all over whether they're $1 or full price.",

    "text": "Love this place. The first time I went with my boo love I got the following, keep your mouth from your keyboard so you don't salivate on it: Chimichanga which was as large as my face and juicy as hell, along with flan and churros as dessert. To drink my girlfriend had 2 (!) Cantaritos, which are basically these high alcohol things in a pottery coffee cup. Because I'm epileptic and am sensitive to alcohol I had only one beer. I walked out feeling like el hombre gordo. I gave the server a $30 tip, like jefe de jefes. Estoy triste after last night, for I left hambre.   Fast forward to last night. I just took my lady to see Ina Garten and listening to someone talk about food left me hungry as hell. My girlfriend really wanted to eat at Patron since its on the way home in Highland Park. I looked up online that they stopped seating at 9:45 PM and close at 10:00 PM. I HATE going into a place that is closing soon, and as someone who has worked in beer and beverage customer service before, I think if you're coming in 15-30 mins-ish before closing, be ready to order quickly, and try to order something that's \"reasonable.\" In other words, don't sit there for 25 minutes dilly-dallying, don't order the most complicated thing on the menu and don't be upset if something is out for the night.   That being said we got in at 9:21 PM. The host looked like we just ran his kitten over with a humvee, the kittens mangled eyes and face crushed underneath the tires. I'm telling you, the servers eyes lost all hope for the future. I already sensed it wasn't good to be there. I told them right away on the way in, \"I know you are closing soon...we just want an enchilada and a drink!\" We were seated soon after. I offered to the server to bring the check/asked for the check so that if we were the last table she had (there were two other couples in our row) that she can close out our checks for the night and finish up whatever sidework she had so its not two hours after closing that she's done. I asked for a Cantarito this time, as I wanted to try it. Not even 10 seconds after she walked away and poured our salsa, the manager whose kitten we metaphorically ran over came over and said they were refusing to give us drinks. I didn't understand what he was saying since he was speaking so lightly and because Corridos were blasting overhead. Imagine getting your ass kicked to a corrido? That's what happened to me last night. Anyway, I am epileptic and can't really get drunk or I'll have a seizure, which I tried to explain, but they just said sorry.   I love this place but I think they should change hours to 9:00 PM, or at least have some sort of stated policy that they won't serve you alcohol after a certain time. I can't drink and offered to get my breathalyzer I use on my partner, and was turned down from having a beverage, and it was very clear that it was because they didn't want to serve us. Very upsetting. Anyway I went to Taco Bell and got this, in the picture depicted below. Way better customer service.",

It has the painted chairs with colorful animals and such. I enjoyed it. We, of course, ordered tacos and they were just okay and pretty standard for $1 tacos. I'm not sure if they are always like this but overall they were average. We also ordered margaritas which were subpar, you couldn't really taste the alcohol which some people might like but I always like to taste in a little bit.

I couldn't find self parking around so I opted for their valet.  Normally, I would walk rather than pay someone to move my car.  On the valet sign there was no price for the service.  I assumed that it was complimentary and would give a tip.  Well, I got my car, gave what I thought was a decent tip, and was told there is a flat rate.  Luckily, I had just the right amount of cash for the rate, but no extra for the tip.   I could have pulled up, put on my flashers, and made change for them.  I decided not to do this after his reaction to me being unaware there was a flat rate (even though it wasn't on the sign...) He gave attitude to his coworker about me, right in front of me!    It was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of the good food I just consumed.  I gave 4 stars because Patron's food, decor, and service deserved it.

Chicken is mixed with fajitas and the flavor is variable depending on the week.  Beef and chicken are a little more consistent.  All three come with cotija and lettuce. The refried beans are really good too ($2-3) and the free homemade salsa is awesome.  The quality of the service depends on the individual server and how busy the kitchen is that night.  I have had service that ranges from impeccable to appalling, but it's cheap so I can't complain.  Again, I would only recommend this on Mondays for the special, however, they can't always take large groups (they don't take reservations on Monday nights).  On other days, it's too expensive for the quality and too disorganized. Parking in this area is usually a pain if you have to stash your car; expect to drive around for awhile.",

We had to ask for more salsa just to put on the tacos. My enchiladas where bland. The rice and pinto beans had no seasoning at all. I also ordered queso which tasted like velvetta cheese. This place was a waste of time and money. Do not come to this place. I thought Mexican food was about spice and flavors. This place is for people who have a bland palate.",

I used to think that I was maybe ordering the wrong thing, but after like 4 \"wrong things\" in a row I'm done throwing money away.  I once had a vegetarian fajita that came with carrot coins.  Like the frozen kind.  For $14.  I'm currently eating $11 carne asada tacos that consisted of three sad little tacos with overlooked meat, no rice or beans on the side, and nothing but some really crazy overly potent hot sauce. So basically after drink and a tip i spent $17 on three of the tiniest worst tacos I've ever had in my life. Maybe it is just me, everything my dining partners are currently eating looks pretty good but I'm just sitting here staring at them because I finished my limp tacos in about 2 bites and two minutes.  Who knows, maybe I'm consistently ordering the wrong thing, but I never seem to have that problem anywhere else.",

However, I have to agree with some of the other comments that the guacamole was sub-par. I don't think it was a matter of freshness, it was just bland. We also had a pitcher of margaritas that was pretty bad - tasted like limeaide. I don't want to give a bad review because the main courses were great and the staff was super nice, but if you're going to claim to be a Mexican restaurant you've got to get the guacamole and margaritas right! Hopefully it'll improve in these areas - if so, I'd give it another try.",

Our waiter, Jerry, was absolutely amazing - so friendly and attentive, he made us both feel welcome and comfortable.  The food was absolutely amazing, we both couldn't get over how tender and flavorful the chicken was. I'm usually a big baby about spicy things but the complimentary salsa was perfect for both my husband (who loves spicy items) and I. We were so impressed that we were offered refills as well.  We aren't usually dessert people but couldn't resist the fried ice cream and we were so pleased that we kept talking about it all evening.  Finally, the margaritas: for $1.00 more you can add flavor and at Jerry's suggestion, I went with a strawberry-mango one. It tasted like a smoothie! So delicious.   I'm so glad I finally have something to look forward to on a Monday. Thank you, Patron!",

He came to see what the issue was, instead of just apologizing and moving on he argued with us and tried to explain how we were wrong and the food was seasoned fine and that he had never gotten complaints before.

    "text": "2/22/2016, national margarita day - let me preface this review by saying that I've been to Patron multiple times without any issue.   I get it, the place was packed. My friend and I requested a table for two at around 9:30 PM. While we were being seated, we noticed a group of friends sitting nearby and went to chat. After being encouraged to sit down (where there was easily enough room for two others) we did.   The waitress that came by could not be more hostile. Immediately stating that no additional orders were being taken, but that we could \"go to the bar yourself and grab a drink\"  After my friend and I grabbed drinks (quite easily I may add, as if they weren't actually as backed up as she claimed) we sat back at the table and resumed chatting with our friends.   At one point, the waitress happens to walk by, checking in on everyone and grabbing empty plates. She bumps my margarita glass accidentally, to which I joked 'what if she did that on purpose'. Well, she turns around to state, \"if I wanted to, I wouldn't have bumped your glass, I would've taken the whole thing and dumped it over your head\" to which I laughed hysterically.   She also stated \"once you finish your drinks, you need to leave this table. My manager has my back\" FALSE!  Her manager came over a few minutes later to ensure everything was alright and apologize that we were not served.   Listen I get it, it's a busy time, we didn't behave as the ideal customers by sitting with friends we saw instead of the table they had assigned us, but some of these statements were straight out of a Server Training Video titled, \"what not to say to customers, no matter how terrible your night\"  What an awful experience from what used to be one of my favorite spots for casual Mexican food. Unfortunately, 0 stars is not an option.   I'd recommend firing this waitress (don't recall her name, not that I cared, but she'd be the one you saw and thought 'yea, she's too old to be a waitress at a Mexican chain'), but I doubt she's qualified to obtain work anywhere else. Definitely not with that attitude.",

I was irritated the first time it happened, but then when it happened again recently, I was mad enough to come write a negative review on a good restaurant because you just don't do that to people who call in trying to give you good business.  I have been a good customer for years and to ask if i can hold and then never come back to the phone to take my order is rude as hell.  Bad business to do that.  Fix your phone skills Patron.",

I was afraid my review would be harsh but every day when I walk by and see the restaurant vacant I'm guessing that there are many others out there who share my opinion.  First off, I expected good salsa.  I have no doubt that the salsa came from a wholesale jug.   The chips that accompanied the salsa clearly came out of a box and were disgusting.  I would have rather gone across the street to Chipotle for chips and salsa.    I ordered a quesadilla for dinner which was lackluster similar to the overall experience.  This place needs a new menu or at least a chef who understands Mexican beyond prepackaged prepared goods.  Overall I would suggest walking up the street to Mad Mex or go to Chipotle and save some money.  Patron is just not worth it.",

    "text": "Great big place and I could see coming here if you have a big party and forgot to make reservations somewhere. The food, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't consider it authentic. Also, we had to send some of our plates back because some where really hot while the others were freezing cold. My advice: get liquored up while waiting for your food.",
