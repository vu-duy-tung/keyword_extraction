Always order onion rings and others in party order the lobster Mac, which is fantastic.  Suggestion - if the onion rings have been sitting, order fresh, they will make them.  The soups are better than anything we've had in New Orleans!  The staff behind the fish sandwich counter are not always the friendliest, but that is easily overlooked because of what you get in the end - fantastic food.  The cashier is always very nice and friendly.  Yes, the parking to always had to get, but just be patient and wait it out in their lot.  (Wholey's just bought and tore down the candy store next to the parking lot for more parking).  Of course, the fresh seafood in the store is always the best and the meat is the best there is along with the produce and unique items they sell.   The butcher staff are so helpful and friendly.  Wholey's is the best place in the Strip!",

Besides for some expansions and cosmetic upgrades here and there, the place has never changed.  This is about as good as it gets when it comes to traditional markets.  Besides for stocking up on the multitudes of fresh, unique and even bizarre seafood specialties, I would always get the fish and chips or a cup of those fried smelts at the hot-bar.  They've been serving these since - well forever ago.  Places like this give me the goosebumps in how real they are - don't expect anything pretty - no glitzie graphics, no wi-fi access, no keen-wa, no other latest and greatest \"hipster\" trends - just authentic awesomeness.  This is the kind of place where you feel like you are truly living the Pittsburgh experience and it makes this city the great and unique place it is.",

    "text": "First off, do not go to the address listed for these reviews.  I am guessing that folks just started posting here, and never stopped.  The correct location is actually at the 1700 block.  This place , the 1500 block, is where the wholesale market for restaurants and grocery stores is.  Pretty obvious, unless you are not from the area, in which case you will be wondering \"Where the $%$# is Wholey's ?\" if you go to 1501 Penn Ave.  Bought the jumbo crab legs here yesterday.  At 25 bucks a pound for the jumbos, definitely not cheap, but celebrating a new job and at the same time starting a two week Cisco class.  Anyways...  I love crab.  I remember first buying the snow crab in 1985, when you could buy large snow crab legs that rivalled the size of todays king crab legs for $2.79 a pound.  Kind of like you used to be able to get skirt steak for a buck a pound before people discovered how delicious skirt steak is.  The regular king crab was $18.00 per lb.  The jumbo are $25.00 per lb.  I said what the heck, and got three pounds of the jumbos.  Which came out to six legs.    First big plus, they are very \"clean\".  Don't have big chunks of ice crusted on them, which forces you to pay $25.00 a pound for water.  Second, at that price, I have zero problem having the person at the counter dig down in the display to get exactly what I want.  And while other folks may have had bad experiences, I have never had a surly counter person, they never have any problem getting what I want.  But like I said, for the price these things cost, they better not have a problem with digging out the ones I want.  And last, they were very good looking.  No \"odd' coloration or look.    When I got these things home, I only steamed two of them.  Which was a very healthy sized meal.  And they were the sweetest and best tasting I had ever had.  Just ate them with butter.  Today, I am just going to thaw and heat one of them, then chop up the meat and have it over iceberg lettuce with FRESH MADE Ranch dressing.  I love getting Hidden valley Ranch, mixing it with just a pint of sour cream, and dressing iceberg and king crab meat with it.  One of my favorite, and most likelt easiest, meals.  And!!!  Wholey's is a full serve grocery store.  They have a full meat department, veggies, not as big as a Giant Eagle or a Wal-Mart, but definitely better than either place.    So DON'T think of Wholey's as just a place for seafood.  You can get your whole party stocked from here.  Now, the bad things.  They only have five (5!?!?!) cash registers.  Also, they sell sushi, but it is so popular, unless you want to stand there for half an hour, don't get the sushi unless you happen to walk in, and no one is standing in line.  In which case, get the sushi.  It is pretty good, suprsingly so.",

I also get a side of smelts and an order of clam strips instead of fries.  Top it off with a glass (now plastic bottle - times change) of buttermilk and you have a real Pittsburgh tradition - well, maybe it's just MY Pittsburgh tradition, but it never disappoints.  For the life of me, I cant figure out why people go to primanti's for a flavorless starch sandwich when they can get one of the best fish sandwiches on the planet!  The market is fun too.  They have an impressive selection of fish and meats.  Not super fancy, but out of the ordinary.",

As soon as they nab you coming in the front door with all the fresh seafood showcases and the deli on your left, you're hooked!   Sure, it ain't pretty, it ain't new and possibly the poor review from Mel below was because she, like my husband, she doesn't like the smell of what an old school fish market smells like. All I know is if we had something like this in San Diego, every Asian within 100 miles would be there every day.   I mistakenly thought that when we first walked in, drawn in by the sale signs for crab cakes and salmon pinwheels, it would be in and out....but nooooo....it is just the beginning of a labyrinth that would boggle my freakin' mind. So on past the seafood, then past a huge showcase of all kinds of bacon (heaven) and fresh and homemade sausages, to a corner devoted to poultry to a ready made deli, it's a little like being \"Alice in Wholey Land.\"   There's a veggie section with many fruits and green things and lots of very cool things scattered about on shelves and such. I saw lots of funky cheeses, soups and tidbits...you folks are really lucky. :o)",

Wholey's might not be the cleanest market in the Strip but it definitely has its appeal, and it worth the trip inside to see what they have to offer. Actually don't even go inside try some of the food that is cooked right outside, and you are bound to enjoy yourself.  You can lose yourself inside because there is just so much that this place has to offer.  Fish market, produce, spices, hard to find hot sauces, just to name some of the reasons why you are going to stay for while when perusing the aisles of Wholey's.  In addition, there is small fish kitchen inside which makes great fish sandwiches.  Definitely try one before you leave.    The main reason why Whole's holds its value in the Strip is because it is an experience inside.  There is just so much to do in this marketplace, there is no reason to not take a look inside to see if you can't find something that you didn't know that you wanted.",

First I thought it was just seafood, then I saw meat, then I saw fancy groceries and produce - it's everything you need!  And it's (mostly) well-priced!  Some items seemed a bit overpriced, but most were very reasonable.  We got some lovely salmon for only $6 a pound.  I think it was \"salmon tail\" so maybe that's a cheaper cut, but it tasted lovely and fresh.  We also got very inexpensive and HUUUUUGE chicken breasts.  These things were massive!  You wouldn't think that it mattered where you get boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but you can tell there was something special about these.  They were just...plumper.  And they smelled fresh and looked gorgeous.  We also got a pound of also very inexpensive housemade hot Italian sausage that was soooo yummy!  Made it tonight with rigatoni in tomato vodka sauce.  It would be a wonderful accompaniment to any meal.  We've only been in the Strip District once, but we'll definitely be back to visit Wholey's again!",

Based on the prices I noticed, I would assert that the prices here are on par with Giant Eagle. Obviously, some goods are a bit more expensive while others are a little less expensive.  Despite having 'Fish Market' in the store's name, I have to say that the main draw were the prices in the meat section. I was able to pick up three cuts of thin NY Strip Steak and three cuts of Filet mignon for a bit over $12 for each. $4 for a cut of Filet Mignon! I'm not sure if there was a sale or a pricing error but wow. And I had no complaints about the quality of the meats.  Wholey's is certainly worth a stop when visiting the Strip.

I threw those in the trash because all ten of those fries were room temperature.   Last week they double charged me for shrimp. There are places closer to work that have good food.",

Yes people, I know this is primarily a fish market, but I cannot put myself through that again.  I did make it through the whole store, but because of the overwhelming smell, I did not purchase anything.  In fact I ended up being like a little kid in here standing at the tanks in the back staring at the fish and lobsters.  I also marveled at the train that literally scared the crap out of me when I first realized it was there.    Honestly I do not know if the prices here are better than other places as I was not too keen on looking, therefore I did not notice the prices.  I also did not venture to purchase one of their \"famous\" fish sandwiches...I don't think I could stomach it.",

The fish and chips were very good. The fish is flaky and the batter is wonderful. The crab cakes were less than desired, mostly filler. But they were still pretty good. The chips are awesome, though. Thick cut and sprinkled with Old Bay. The whole meal was like $22. Not bad.  For shopping, we got a few odds and ends. They have tons of fresh fish and dozens of different frozen selections. Its all pretty pricey but, for Pittsburgh, its the place to get fish if that's what you're into.",

    "text": "I love this store and its owners, but I can never go back there again.       I made the mistake of ordering  a live fish, observing that one of the practitioners chopped off the head, then proceeded to filet the fish. I felt that was humane enough and expected that the fellow handling mine would do the same. It seemed unnecessary to ask, \"is the fish already out of it's misery before you process it\".      So I ordered one, expecting what I had seen to transpire again.     However, a different guy, frustratingly slower, skinned the poor fish, cut his fins, changing knives while the head was still unsevered from the spine, its poor heart beating in its chest while being flayed. its tail flapping, and I asked if it was killed, but he didn't answer.   \"Did you see it move\"? he asked with a smile i didn't like, still cutting.  He said after he was done, that they had just stunned the fish before cutting it open.       I am horrified. I never would have ordered it if I had known the method this man would choose to use. I do not understand why they couldn't have made sure it was out of its misery before all that the poor creature went through. Who wants to consume something that has been unnecessarily tortured this way?   In my distress,  I asked for the owner, who I usually see there, but neither of them were there. The manager with whom I spoke was unsympathetic and unhelpful.      It really ruined my day and disrupted my harmony. I just wanted to know that my food was food before being treated like food.I am horrified with the poor creature's demise, and disgusted with the people who I dealt with at Wholley's in the owners absence.",

This week fresh salmon fillets were $5.99 a pound and swordfish steaks were $7.99 a pound.  The quality is super high and the results delicious! I have bought the bulk filet mignon a few times at 9.99-11.99 a pound and grilled it whole, which turns out to be an easy and awesome meal for a group.  They also have a nice selection of prepared foods and produce, all at great prices, including Andy's sushi right up front as well as lobster rolls outside and freshly shucked oysters.  This is a near weekly stop for me even though it's a bit of a drive.  If you live near Pittsburgh please do yourself a favour and give Wholey's a try.",

Though I'm not great about knowing competitive prices myself, I came here with my sister-in-law about a year or two ago, and she was extremely impressed with how inexpensive everything was.   Currently, two of my favorite things from Wholey's are their fresh peanut butter (try the honey roasted, too) and their guava jelly. The peanut butter is out-of-this-world delicious. The guava jelly isn't mind blowing, but I can't find it at the local Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's, so I love that I can get it somewhere in Pittsburgh. (My mom grew up in Africa and my dad's mom was from Cuba, so I inherited a love of guava from both sides!) When my husband and I came here last weekend, we bought jellies and sauces for some family members as Christmas gifts, so I can't wait to find out what they think of all the items.",

Being able to get several things I like in one spot is something I like to be able to do as I am always short on time.  They also have a lot of basics as well so if you are in a pinch and need bread (they even have Pepperidge Farms Light Style which is what I often buy and not many places have this), some veggies, etc you will also find them here.  It is more than a fish market.   Great prices, great selection... that is why I choose Wholey's.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh Bound!  Part VII  I moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!  (For part VI, go to: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/review_share/afRmUb4fRAis4pj4la81pg/review/37RV-CLTN_VtfuDV0aFwXQ?fsid=Z8qxRyyV5MsVe8lEfPWIYg\">yelp.com/review_share/af...</a>)  Wholey's is the best fish market I've ever been to.  When you enter, Andy of Andy's Sushi greets you at the door.  To the left is the kitchen area that's been there for as long as I can remember, and to the right a room filled with fresh fish being scaled and filleted by experts.    The kitchen is what I love the most about Wholey's.  When I was young, my parents would do their shopping, and before we left, they would pick up some fried shrimp for us.  We would then go back to the car and eat the shrimp on the tailgate of the car while watching all of the people go by.  If you buy fish from the market side of the building, you can then take it to the kitchen where they will cook it for you in whatever fashion you'd like.  Places like this are few and far between.  Instead of fried shrimp at the end of our shopping, I now make it a point to go to the kitchen first and get a cup of incredible lobster bisque to carry around while I shop.  The soup is so flavorful and creamy and is the perfect comfort food on a cold day.  In a very normal Strip moment for not only me, but just about everyone that I know, I didn't \"need\" anything, but I can't help myself when I'm here.  I picked up some pepper smoked salmon to have as a snack later in the day, and my mom went to town, buying what appeared to be nearly 400 lbs. of bacon, and a few bags of frozen calamari in her typical early preparation for Christmas Eve dinner (keep in mind that it's currently September).    Thanks to Wholey's, I'm pretty sure that the majority of my inheritance has been frittered away by my parents.  My guess is that the folks have single-handedly kept Wholey's in business all of these years on impulse buys alone.    Even if you don't have the need or travel means to buy a whole salmon or live crabs, Wholey's is at least worth checking out.  (For Part VIII, go to: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/review_share/1uvcySLWM75MzlLM12F8dA/review/6ht1cyxYCAKExjg_Tc_HwQ?fsid=s1rEBoNOZ5ycTbDCtvJrzA\">yelp.com/review_share/1u...</a>)",

    "text": "Walking down Penn Avenue on our first day back and second trip to Pittsburgh of 2016 the sky is grey and low and the sidewalks are grimy and slick. The Strip District is the bottomland where the rivers converge. These days it's a mix of blue-collar mechanical, small local retail, warehousing and up-scale residential in converted factories. Comfortable for middle aged tradesmen and young developers, designers alike. If you belong to either of these worlds you feel right at home here. We are going to Wholley's. When I see the red and white striped design of the awnings up ahead my heart leaps a little.  There is a lot to like about this city. There is an awfully lot of good food to be had from a diverse array of cultures. The thing I've fallen head over heels for and that on paper you can find anywhere but that in reality can only truly find here and is really special is fried cod on a roll.  That sounds silly and it makes me sound like a silly person for saying it. But it's not silly. And goofy I might be, for the five month interim between visits I had fish and chips or fish sandwiches from all over and was always disappointed. Isn't flavor about alchemy? Isn't cooking magic? Add one piece of batter fried cod (or two, either way it's so much your eyes will bug out when you see them assemble your meal) to one fresh baked roll from Mancini's bakery next door (that's another story and by God they are good too!), add hot or tartar sauce and it equals one really good sammich.  I smoked for most of my adult life and I know what cravings are like. Addictions are ever present and are squirrely in the way they worm their way in and out of your thoughts. I craved a Wholley's fried fish sandwich for five bloody months and get this, it didn't disappoint.  You will read a lot about places that you need to go to when you're downtown in the \"Burgh\": Primanti Bros, Deluca's... ( I love Deluca's too...bring Cash $$ BTW) but the place I would suggest is this place. Get a fish sandwich. Get a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese. Or maybe onion rings. Get it at 9:00 in the morning for breakfast (we did this like...three days running). Have it for lunch. GO UPSTAIRS and sit in the lovely rustic dining area (Read: exposed plumbing, worn carpet, bus yr. own table and tear a new sheet of butcher paper for your table when you leave TKS VRY MUCH). Absorb the ambiance. Listen to the animatronic cow down stairs. Or the model train that runs around between floors. Afterwards walk through  the fish market, the butcher shop and small grocery. Have some pink fudge and a mix of cheese and caramel popcorn for a snack. Walk back to the apartment and crash on the couch with your lover and look off into the distance down the river and stare at the hundreds or bridges and decide where you want to have dinner. If you need it.",

If you are a seafood fan, you will definitely come to appreciate it as they not only sell fresh seafood either fresh or frozen, but also a number of prepared foods with seafood embedded into the choices in their hot foods bar. My particular favorites are the lobster macaroni & cheese and the soft serve crab sandwiches.   Lobster mac & cheese Pros - taste is on par; a bit on the creamy side though, not too salty reasonable portion sizes  Cons - lobster meat taste is overpowered by mac & cheese  Soft serve crab sandwiches Pros - generous portion sizes ... it will definitely leave you full authentic crab used, which is definitely appreciated different sauces given to enhance flavor ... tartar, shrimp cocktail, etc.   Cons - meat can be a bit dry at times ... probably due to overcooking  In general, a great place to hit up if you're a seafood lover.",

Yes, they don't have the overall Market District grocery selection, but the freshness and selection of seafood is unmatched, and you can find anything that you're looking for while shopping there. They just might not have 100 different choices of grape jelly. Even if you can't find everything you're looking for, I'd say Wholey's is the ideal place to start your shopping for meats and fish, and you can cross the rest of your grocery list off at the other places in The Strip.  As Rachel C. pointed out, be prepared to be slightly overwhelmed by the fishy smell, but you won't find a fish market anywhere that doesn't smell that way, so just accept it as part of the experience and then go home and enjoy the fresh seafood that you just bought for a reasonable price!",

And while the do have a great selection of fish and seafood, their selection of meats and poultry is really awesome. I swear you can get pretty much any part of an animal you're looking for; chops, loins, innards...peaks...butts! I saw an assortment of exotic ground meat like Elk and Boar today that really got me thinking. They have produce and a small grocery section with normal stuff like butter and canned goods. Their little deli section has surprisingly good prices. And when I am making pepperoni rolls, they are my go-to for sliced pepperoni; it's Hormel, the same I can get at Market District for about 2 bucks less. They have a Champagne ham that my mother loves and some really interesting cheeses. The deli also has an assortment of salads like ham, antipasto and seafood. But I would beware; they're not very good. The antipasto especially is...not good. I think one of my favorite parts in the hot foods/restaurant part. You can get fish sandwiches and fries and stuff. The cod fish sandwich is pretty good and the smelts are awesome. The BF says they're just bait fish, battered and deep fried, but I still think they're yummy. One thing to remember, they only take credit cards over 10 dollars which I think is odd in this day and age, but....",

I usually frequent Penn Ave fish, but honestly, I think I'll be replacing them with Wholey's after a few lackluster trips.  The best part is that Wholey's has a more fast food approach so you get your food quickly and can easily do to go or sit down.  The employees were very friendly and efficient.  There is also plastic wear, which is nice for those of us constantly on the go.  I grabbed an 8 oz. lobster mac and cheese ($3.50) one day, which is a nice side or snack size, and I could easily eat a large within minutes.  It's amazingly creamy with tons of lobster.  Delicious.  The fish sandwich prices are crazy reasonable as well, and I cannot wait to come back and try them.    They did have a $10 credit card, minimum I believe.",

    "text": "A very Pittsburgh experience is to visit the little food stand inside the big fish market know as Wholey in the Strip District. While you're in a big grocery store that specializes in seafood, it wouldn't be a stretch to presume Wholefoods ripped off the idea of dining inside a grocery store from Wholey's. The food is fantastic and you'll enjoy the atmosphere of everyone shopping for lobster, crab or scallops!",

    "text": "Closing time is 6pm on Saturdays~    The bf and I went to grab some food to 'sneak' into the drive-in movie. We got a lot of seafood!!  Total came out to be $36.32    Let's start from the low to the high.  Lobster bisque - scoop your own - Medium was ~$3.50. I did not enjoy this much.. the \"lobster\" was actually crawfish. but I guess you can argue that they are little lobsters. but it was the flavoring that didn't appeal to me. I don't recommend it.   2 pcs crabcakes $6.50 pretty oily but large chunks of crab meat! yummy.. not much breading. just the way i like it. It's about 3 bites for me. I did think it looked a bit overfried though since the breading looked like it was on the verge of getting burned.   fried calamari - $3.99 great saltiness and flavor. Nice portion. We didn't eat this until it was a bit too soggy but it woulda been awesome if eaten immediately.   Lobster rolls $6  each - 2 in a container. They were in multiple sections so we found a container w/o more tail meat and less of claw. It was delicious!! a bit more mayo than I'd like but not bad at all.   cod fish sandiwch ~$7 - this was huge!!  originally we were going to get four lobster rolls but switched 2 rolls to 1 fish sandwich b/c we saw the fish and it looked delicious. Two pieces of fish in each sandwich - we ended up splitting the sandwich and made 2 open-faced fish sandwich.",

    "text": "I stopped by here for lunch today on a bike ride through the Strip District.  The cool, windy fall weather put me in the mood for some warm comfort food, so I opted for the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster and crab bisque.  After debating about the sizes, I decided to get a small (8 oz.) mac and cheese with a Mancini's bread roll (upcharge of 65 cents) and a medium (16 oz.) lobster bisque.  I also had a small (16 oz.) homemade lemonade to go with my meal.  All of this set me back $12.20 w/ tax--not too bad!  The soup and mac and cheese definitely put me in my warm comfort food happy place.  The flavors and textures were pretty good, but they were both a bit on the salty side.  Dial back the salt a bit, and they could be excellent.  I'm glad I decided to get the roll with them, since I used it to dunk in the soup, and it cut the saltiness of the two main items.  I'm also glad that I had the lemonade, too, since its sweetness also helped cut the saltiness.  Based on the freshness of the roll, I'll have to check out Mancini's!  Service was pretty friendly, so no complaints there.  Yes, it does smell quite fishy when you first walk in, as well as over by the fishmonger and down in the basement where the bathrooms are located.  However, the upstairs seating area was nice and didn't smell too fishy to me (it's possible that my nose may have acclimated by then, though.)  There is a toy of some kind that kids play with that sings the same songs over and over and over again (I never did find it, but I could hear it clearly while eating my lunch).  It would be great if it could be moved to an area that isn't as audible to people sitting in the seating area.  (As a railfan, I loved the toy train, however!)  The only other criticism I have is the use of styrofoam cups. The soup bowls are compostable, which is great, but using styrofoam for all of the drink cups cancels out any environmental benefit.  Overall, this was a solid lunch, esp. given the quality:price ratio.  I'll have to stop by again sometime to try the fried fish sandwich, since that's Wholey's signature item.  If you're a seafood fan--or are in the mood for warm comfort food, I'd definitely recommend the mac and cheese and lobster and crab bisque.  It hits the spot!",

One stop shopping at its best! The guys behind the counter are the best.  They can not only tell you everything about the seafood, how they cut it when it arrived, but they can also tell you how to prepare it! It's a pittsburgh staple! And it keeps on growing!

Cafeteria line moves quickly with the advantage of getting your food almost immediately upon entering.  Bread is fresh and of high quality, so rolls are soft and tasty.  Fish is as fresh as fresh can be including oysters.  It is the best seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh (and, in my opinion, may be one of the best seafood eateries in the US). Free refills on soft drinks. So, don't go to fancy restaurants and order seafood; instead, wear jeans and sneakers, and drop into Robert Wholey.",

I love eating my fish whole. I was taught at a young age that you determine the freshness of fish by its eyes. So buying fillets was also seen as a big gamble. I bought some wild caught snapper today and had it for dinner this evening. It was delicious. I also hit up Wholey's for salted codfish or baccalau. In Jamaica, we call it saltfish. Either way, Wholey's has a great selection that hails from Canada. Some salted cod are bony and have a ton of salt and very little flesh, but not the ones at Wholey's. Love this place!",

The fish was lukewarm, almost room temperature, granted it was 2pm and probably hotter and fresher at noon, but that's no way to serve a fish sandwich. I ate upstairs and fortunately there was a microwave to reheat the fish, but the area had lots of flies, it left me with a creepy feeling, I wished I hadn't gone there at all and it's quite expensive by Pittsburgh standards, over $9.50 for a small fish sandwich with lettuce and tomato (another dollar) and a small cole slaw (another $1.25). One of the much better deals and a cleaner environment to eat in is at Loose Moose; they'll sell you a nice and hot fish sandwich with fries and a beer all for $5.50 on their days with sandwich specials.",

    "text": "I think this is a really awesome \"grocery\" store. It has PLENTY of seafood, and the prices are not outrageous, and rather reasonable - which I know some places like to charge up the wazoo for seafood. Example: TWO lobster tails of 8-10 oz were just shy of $20. Their lobster mac & cheese is scrumptious, though I do wish it had a bit more lobster. The lobster and crab bisque was also pretty good, though I do wish it had more chunks in it. As for not buying it at a restaurant though, it's the best store bought bisque I have found. There's weekly sales. On top of the yummy seafood on one side, there's a \"middle\" section with pork, beef and chicken.. where the prices are also reasonable. Example: two filet mignons of decent size were $18. That's $10-20 cheaper than when you buy a filet meal at a restaurant, and you only get one for that meal. The last part you hit is similar to a normal grocery store - small olive bar, a few frozen meals (mostly seafood related, but others as well), small pasta and bread section, cheese and meat and eggs, and a decent amount of produce which is also fairly priced! There's a parking lot dedicated to shoppers at Wholey's.  Excellent location, and a fun crowd on the weekends.  I need to try their sushi or meals to go next time.",

The frozen meat arrived in a foam box packed with dry ice. Although some of the chicken wings were partially defrosted, the core temperature of this order was still below the temperature danger zone and most of my products including a leg of lamb, some lamb chops, and some sausages were still frozen. Given that I live in Arizona and it's 109 degrees outside, this was really quite impressive. This was incidentally why I ordered in bulk. Not only did I get free shipping but the extra mass helped keep this order nice and cold.   Aside from the quality of the meat, the speed of shipping, and the condition of my shipment upon arrival, another reason I liked this company was that they didn't debit my PayPal account until my order was packed and shipped.   Other online retailers (who debit accounts even if they're out of stock and are unable to supply an order) could take a lesson from Wholey's. I will definitely shop with them again.",

Although there is a fishy smell to the store, which may not put one in the right mind about the quality, I've never had a problem with spoiled or rotten fish here. Quality seems to be just fine.  The fresh fish selection is pretty vast. The ready-made crab cakes (usually 2 for $3) are a bit salty but I'm still a fan. Keep on wandering through the store and you'll find a nice variety of fresh meats, chicken, pork, etc and produce for pretty good prices.  As for service, the (older) gentlemen who clean the whole fish are pretty gruff . Honestly, they're a little intimidating and I wish Wholey's would/could do something to get friendlier service at this part of the store. The (younger) staff who work the cut-up fish stalls tend to be pretty friendly and so does the rest of the staff so it's a shame these guys get away with a less than ideal demeanor.",

The anticipation is awesome, and everything just hits you all at once--the sights, the sounds, the smell!  Fish and crustaceans are everywhere.  People are everywhere.  Customers and butchers are calling out orders.  It's...EXCITING!  Such a great seafood, meat, and produce market.  Children always seem to have a blast at Wholey's.  They get a kick out of the live fish and lobsters in the tanks in the back.  You can also introduce them to Wholey Bear (who wears an old #55 Porter jersey out front on the sidewalk) and Rachel the Pig (who collects donations for the Children's Hospital).  Then there's also what I call \"The Steelers Fisherman\" and \"Mr. Penguin.\"  I'm not making this stuff up; these things exist and should make sense if you've been to Wholey's!  Now, an interesting little tangent.  Ever see the movie \"10th & Wolf?\"  It's a pretty good 2006 organized crime film that's set in Boston but was filmed in Pittsburgh.  Towards the end of the movie there's a dramatic chase scene--right through Wholey's!  You see the name on the door and everything.  Pretty cool, huh?!     I'm removing 1 star only because of the produce; there always seems to be a noticable amount of overly ripe stuff on the shelves when I visit Wholey's.  Pears automatically come to mind.  Anyone who appreciates seafood and/or traditional butcher markets shouldn't miss an opportunity to check out Wholey's!",

They've done lobster rolls and fresh oysters when in-season outside the store for a long time now, but I think it's only been recently that they started to do grilled salmon and lobster dinners as well. So you can actually get full-fledged meals while walking past without even going inside. I've only had the salmon, which comes with some grilled zucchini, and it is super flavorful and fresh coming straight off the grill. All of this together makes Wholey's a fun experience for any passersby.",

After parking our car we headed McDonalds to get a quick lunch as usual - we'd rather not having frozen seafood sitting in the trunk for 20 minutes. But the carpark attendants came and almost threatened us to move our vehicle in an extremely ill-mannered and uneducated way. Made me reconsider if I will ever go to this place again.",

Wonderful oysters (seriously), friendly service, conveniently located (I don't have to shove through people in the market), and cheap.  At $1 a piece, or like 3 for $5, or 6 for $10-something like that-you really can't go wrong.  I've had two different shuckers that were both extremely friendly and conversational.  They shuck the oyster right there while you wait.  They have lemon, horse radish, and hot sauce on the whim, right there at the little stand!   If you happen to be passing by, stop and say hello and grab a fresh cold oyster!  I was trying to make it every Friday for a drive by oyster snack during nice weather.  I'm not sure if they're open during the winter, but be sure to check!  I brought an out of town oyster guru friend and he thought they were amazing.  Winner!  As for the store, they have a great selection of seafood.  Being from Houston, I'm used to the crawfish, catfish, fried shrimp kind, but much prefer the selection here.  It's a little pricey, but nothing outrageous.  I love the hustle and bustle of a seafood market and this place doesn't disappoint!  A slice of San Francisco in the Burgh.  They also have other items besides just seafood.  And sidewalk oysters!",

    "text": "The market side gets 4 stars, the restaurant 2.  When you walk in the door there is a sign that says Rule #1: the customer is always right. Rule #2: if the customer is wrong, see rule #1. They could use some reminding.  After ordering a couple sandwiches, which were handed over quickly, walked up to pay. There was one older lady there trying to pay, and the cashier was bickering with her. She had put her soup in the wrong container, it seems, and the cashier was yelling at her about it. She got the right container and poured the lady's soup in there, which didn't work very well and soup went everywhere. So she started cleaning soup, all the while berating the customer. (To be fair, by the time I walked up they were both very cranky, and I know its hard to be nice to someone when they are fussing at you - but that's the woman's job.)   By the time she finished cleaning the counter, the woman's purchases, and finally got around to ringing her up, the line had backed up quite a lot. It took nearly 10 minutes. Then I went up and the girl started snapping at me too, and went on complaining about the last customer, which I found to be really rude. Finally I was able to pay and grab a seat.  The fish sandwich was good, as advertised. The fries were horrendous. Already cold when served, they were a mass of congealed grease by the time we sat. I ate one and gave up on them. The coleslaw was nice though. The fries were an odd problem to me - in a place with that many fryers, they should always be fresh.  The market I liked a lot, and I'll be back there, probably a lot. They sell chicken feet, which makes broth that makes me happy.",

    "text": "For seafood, there is nobody with more selection.  Unfortunately we do not buy much seafood... little pricey just about everywhere.  We do purchase a fair amount of pork, veal, steak and ground meat. Used to visit Wholey's every two weeks for strip steaks, veal scallopini, pork roasts and other things. Thought the price and selection were very good... looking at the \"package cost.\" One day I looked at the per-pound cost. NO VALUE HERE! Real awakening.  I need to emphasize a point here: I have never had bad meat, seafood or produce from Wholey's. Everything has been first rate. However, depending on where you live, there may be better choices.  I now purchase meat from Mcginnis Sisters in Monroeville. Same prices, BUT the products are on-ice, unwrapped. Hmmm, not descretely covered with labels and stickers. That's important because, as you have learned, sometimes the bad looking stuff goes hidden under the label.  Two days ago I purchased two NY Strip Steaks from Mcginnis Sisters. Same per-pound price as Wholey's, but thicker, better looking and trimmed perfectly. Best strip steaks we have had in a few years. I will not buy anywhere else.   Couple of grocery items we like: San Marizano Canned Tomatoes and Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock. Better price at Penn Mac nearby.   Please don't think I am trashing Wholey's. The store is a great source for many things. Overall it is very good in selection, depth of stock and friendliness of employees. Much better than most supermarkets.   Many of the reviews are based on the food eaten on-premises. I haver never done that. I have shopped for meat, seafood and produce to take home, uncooked.  I live in Murrysville. The time and gasoline cost make it more effective for me to purchase meat and seafood at Mcginnis Sisters. Guess what? It is better there!  What brings me to Pittsburgh: Penn Mac and La Gourmandine French Pastries. Look 'em up. Visit. You'll love both places!",

I have read other reviews about the fishy smell but let me tell you, I was born and grew up at the Jersey Shore where the fresh seafood is stellar, and every fresh fish market will smell slightly like fish.  Fish has a bit of an odor, especially when the market dresses their catch and has refuse.  They have a lot of fresh caught whole fish on ice and a huge variety of dressed filleted choices.  There is lobster, shrimp, oysters, clams, octopus, and a bunch of underwater fare.  Please do not be put off by a slight fish smell, this place has AMAZING fresh seafood and they pride themselves on quality.  Give em a try, I am sure that you will be glad you did.  Take it from a Jersey Shore girl who grew up on fresh seafood, unless you are out on the ocean with a pole and hooks, this is as good as it gets.",

Despite being on the strip, there's parking set aside for Wholey's customers while they shop/eat, so it's easy to get there even on the busiest of days. The restaurant/store is incredibly lively and fun, and you can catch the owners themselves walking around and working on some days.   My family and I stopped in to eat here, and we ordered clam chowder, lobster mac n cheese, fried smelt, crab cakes, calamari, and fried oysters (we LOVE seafood if you couldn't tell). You order food in a school cafeteria style setting, and they have places to sit and eat upstairs as well. Most of the food on the menu is fried, but the amount we paid for the quality and quantity of food we got was incredible. We also stopped outside to eat some raw shucked oysters, which were fresh and flavorful.  Wholey's is a quintessential Pittsburgh experience, and the food never fails to hit the spot. Definitely going back!",

They had a whole bunch of different varieties (see pics) and we took several of each- well maybe more than several as they were ONLY 98 cents each!  The sweetest ones were the greenish colored shells (again-see pics).  We also grabbed 3 pounds of crayfish, a pound of the huge shrimp and some beautiful looking Delmonico steaks.  We were planning a huge dinner.   I LOVE coming here for all the different sights, smells and variety you can find.

Price was reasonable $7.00 for one or 2 for $13.00. I bought one and it was made on a hot dog bun. It was real lobster chilled and tasted very good. I walked inside briefly to get out of the rain and I could smell fish everywhere.  Course that's what one would expect in a fish market. Since I was not purchasing fish for home use I waited out the storm and left. I probably will stop by again if they have another outdoor venue for this sandwich. I really enjoyed it.",

Unfortunately, since there was a long line, I was short on time and stomach space, I didn't get a chance to try any of the seafood sandwiched I read such good things about.  Instead, I tried the lobster rolls they were selling outside. For $7, it was really good for the price. They don't skimp on the lobster meat either. They use big chunks of lobster (including whole pieces of claw meat), which was most likely previously frozen, but it still tasted pretty good. The thing is that it's not that sanitary. The guy making the sammies did change his gloves right after we ordered the roll. But then he handled the cash we gave him, and THEN he grabbed the bread with the same hand! I'm not trying to be a germaphobe here but um...what was the point of changing that glove then?!   So if you're willing to turn the other cheek, you'll get a decent lobster roll. It won't be very clean but then again, what food bought on the street is?",

They have fresh chicken wings here packed on ice. You can get them by the pound versus the prepackaged freezer bags. They have breakfast meats and good cuts of artery clogging bacon. We know it's not healthy but darn, everything in moderation! The produce section contains everything from collard greens to delicious sweet crispy apples and local cider. Towards the register, you'll find fudge and popcorn. Yummers! Oh, and I forgot the deli. This isn't your average deli....what deli do you know of that has lobster rolls and bisque in their case?  Look, I've been coming here for years. It's been a family event at times as well as a touristy spot to show off to some out of towner guest. I like this place because it's given me the opportunity to buy and cook different types of seafood. Some of the fish can't be found in the local grocery stores either. If you've ever had a chance to speak with Mr. Wholey, you may already know he's very passionate about his shrimp and prides himself on only choosing the best to sell at his store. He was pretty cool and down to earth when I met him a little over a year ago.   They have an area upstairs where you can sit and dine. The restrooms are located downstairs in the back of the main entrance.   So, a fish place smells fishy. The fishy smell is the first thing you notice when you hit the door but it's not unbearable by any means. After you're in there for about a minute, you don't even notice it anymore.   One of my favorite places to stop in the strip!",

The staff is super friendly and if you come here you have to get food - whether it be from the restaurant (I recommend the Lobster Mac&Cheese) or the sushi bar (I recommend the kani & spicy tuna roll). The fish are beautiful and fresh! The atmosphere is cultural and a great local market that I am surprised is not packed.

The hot food is to the left of the entrance as soon as you walk in, behind the sushi counter. Hot food menu includes fish sandwiches (ranging from $4.50-$7.99 by size/weight), crab cakes, soft shell crabs, and various appetizers/sides.   I ordered the cod sandwich ($6.25) with a side of calamari ($3.99). The fish sandwich came loaded with crispy white fish meat between soft buns. Smother on some tartar sauce for the touch of perfection! I love the proportion of fish to bun. The calamari was crispy with a slight hint of salt and crunch. The breading was subtle and wasn't overpowering the taste of the squid like other calamari elsewhere. Definitely one of my favorite calamari recipes!  Overall, I highly recommend stopping by Wholey's to try their hot food selections if you're a seafood fan looking for a quick and cheap lunch or snack!",

Fried oyster and fried soft shell crab are my other favors.   2) good deal on live lobster.  I check their website weekly, and their lobster can be as low as $6/lb.  Yes, you have to do the killing at home, but it is live lobster.  Other things are ok too, I buy their spare ribs often. Live oysters are $1 each (DIY openning).  ANd they have a new fresh orange juice machine to make orange juice.  Love their carb selections too (snow, king crab leg, Dungeness)  Wholey is my seafood go-to in the Burgh, unless i am getting sushi-graded tuna / salmon.",

I'm dying to go back and try their soft-shell crab sandwich and lobster mac & cheese because of all the great things I've heard!  I will warn you--- if you show up here on a Saturday afternoon, it's probably going to be PACKED and can get a little crazy. I prefer for go during off-peak hours either during the week or close to closing on the weekends. As annoying as crowds may be, it shows the quality of this place and if you have to deal with a bit of a crowd, I'd say it's worth it!  Probably not ideal if you have to run in for one quick thing.The store is a little bit of a maze and you have to walk through each room to get to the next.   The seafood room is the first impressive sight you'll see when you walk in. You can also get fresh sushi made to order there. I've seen multiple people complaining about the smell in their reviews...but...umm.....it is a fish market.....so...the smell kinda comes with the territory! If you are easily skeeved out by the look or smell of fish, you'll probably want to walk quickly through the first room and keep your eye straight ahead to avoid the rows of fresh fish laid out behind the counter. But you'll survive. I believe in you!  Next you'll find the butcher area, then the deli, then freezer goods, then produce. They are often giving out samples of their lobster bisque around the deli area. WOW. Even if you don't get to sample, grab a container to take home and you can thank me later!",

Wholey's has ABSURD prices, $2 a pound boneless chicken breast, $5 a pound live maine lobster specials.  They have great meat, every fish imaginable, fresh produce, and awesome homemade fudge, peanut butter and candied popcorn.  They also have a in house sushi chef, and tasty fresh made sandwiches and appetizers.  It's not the shrink wrapped giant eagle experience where all the foods are hidden and sealed away.  If the smell or look of fresh seafood offends you, stay far, far away, Wholey's is like traveling back to a fish monger's market from days of yore.  Knowledgeable fish mongers debone massive freshly caught fish and massive slabs of salmon and shrimp are piled high on ice.  The food is out and about, straight off the boat and in many cases still swimming.  If you want great prices, and a huge selection of every kind of fresh fish and meat imaginable, dive into Wholeys!",

Fish of all kinds, clams, bivalves, scallops, crabs, and more are overflowing from the coolers. Even the vegans in my party were astounded by the scale and variety of Wholeys. There's a restaurant upstairs so you can eat some of their delicious seafood. It's almost like hometown Walmart for fish.",

The store is cramped and crowded, but with limited space, that is to be expected. Still, I think they try to do too much. While there is a produce section, for example, the selection of produce they offer is limited. Still, I guess they're really the only game in town if you're in the city and need fruit.",

A grocery \\fish market\\ Meat packing place.  The seafood selection is great here as well as the chicken beef and pork.  The best reason to go here while on your journey on the strip is for a Whaler sandwich.  People you do not need fries with this fresh mammoth fish sandwich.  They bread it in front of you.  You gotta make you way to this place while your in town and in the strip district.",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and I stopped into Wholey's for lunch to try their cod fish sandwich and calamari. The cod fish sandwich was huge and not to mention tasty. It was still crispy and wasn't overwhelmingly greasy and soggy like some other sandwiches I've had where all you taste is the grease. It could have used a little seasoning in the batter, but with some of their tartar sauce and a little hot sauce it was perfect. As for the calamari... WOW!!!! The best I have had yet!! I liked it even more than Detroit Parthenon's calamari. Which is now my second favorite. It's going to be hard to find calamari that tops Wholey's and their price. For $3, you get a really healthy portion... about 1/3 of a paper bag. There is no need to douse them in cocktail sauce or lemon juice at all. They are perfect plain because they have already added some extraordinary seasoning to it. I also had one of their moon pies and a brownie. Both were scrumptious to say the least. The crab cakes were packed with chunks of crab and were excellent.  The upstairs dining area where we sat was a little hard to find and looked like a typical diner... it was quaint but nothing special.  I wasn't able to try their fresh fish obviously because I couldn't take it home with me on my 4 1/2 hour trek back to the D. But I am planning on trying out their mail order service. Everything looked really fresh, they even have a variety of live fish in huge tanks, I mean you can't get any fresher than that. I just wish Detroit had some sort of fish market of this caliber. I would be there all the time!!",

We ate lunch from the hot bar area, which was delicious but not the healthiest thing. I got a po'boy with shrimp, coleslaw and chips on the side. We also tried the lobster mac and cheese. The portions are huge and I don't think I was hungry for dinner until MUCH later that night.  The seating area is up some stairs and surprisingly big. There are signs everywhere indicating that they hope you have a pleasant experience and to let someone know if things aren't tidy. An employee was putting fresh sheets of brown paper on the tables and wiping everything up. There were also several different condiment and flatware stations.   I love that we stopped by this long-standing Pittsburgh gem. I just probably picked up a piece of fruit of something from the grocery section to go with my meal! ;)",

The parking attendant is a nice sweet man who watches your car ...how do I know he is paying attention because someone hit my car and he had the store page me I love Wholeys anyway go ahead park your car is safe  then go on in and you will be treated to a wonderful shopping experience right in front is a small sushi chef ready to make your favorite rolls and such. to one side there is a small hot food counter with fish Sammies and other assorted things such as fries and wings. (there is a nice seating area upstairs so you can sit and enjoy) and then there is the fish counter its the entire length of the store with friendly fish mongers to help you choose in the back are tanks with the still living that can be on your plate later. The fish sellers are so friendly and always helpful I have bought salmon, flounder, tilapia and other assorted fresh fish its always good  they also have a nice assortment of frozen fish  The fish is a standout... they also have a large meat section. There is also their deli section delish fresh salads we have bought the coleslaw numerous times.  They also sell yummy chicken pot pies ( I do not eat meat but son & husband love them) plenty of fresh vegetables and other assorted staples to me the prices seem higher then a regular supermarket but everything always looks nice and fresh and then their is the fresh squeezed orange juice its doesn't come cheap but its squeezed right there in front of you and by a real honest to goodness Wholey he is super friendly and you just feel good buying his juice. I love this store with a passion and will not buy my fish anywhere else ever again",

Not a better place for buying raw fish and seafood around! I have been going to Wholeys since I first started working down near the Strip about 2 years ago. A True Pittsburgh staple indeed!   I am in love with the hot food. I know Wholeys is mostly famous for the fresh seafood and fish. But working in the strip I had to eat here for lunch. So one day I came down and ordered the grand daddy of all fish sandwiches, the 1ld. Great Whiting. I think I underestimated how monstrous this sandwiches was going to be. But the truth is, the fish is always fried to perfection! You also get to pick which kind of bun you want. Also, if you get the meal, includes coleslaw and your choice of side. I once got the Lobster Mac n cheese. Unreal. So good, it'll put grandmas mac n chees to shame.  For anyone else who spends tons of time in the Strip, it's nice to know that they also have ready made food you can grab on the go. They have lobster sandwiches, crab cakes and other cold items you can snag and go if you're in a hurry. One of the hidden gems in Wholeys, maybe hidden, would be Anthony's Sushi. If you know Anthony, there is nothing hidden about him or his personality. One of the bubbliest, happy kind of guy you'll ever met! And damn can he makes sushi! My Girlfriend has been eating his sushi for a year plus now and basically needs it to survive. All his ingredients are fresh and he is the quickest su-chef around!   If you haven't been to Wholeys yet and you live in the area, what's your problem!? Go NOW!",

There super famous for there fresh seafood department. And lobster Mac! I decided to swing by and pick up a fresh rabbit and some of there own seasoning. I got a two pound rabbit for around 10 bucks and the seasoning for around 3 bucks. The cool thing is when your leaving they have a ice cart they you can scoop a little in your bag to keep food cold on your drive back home. I've also never had a bag break or leak in the car so your safe there! I highly recommend coming here and trying all the delicious food they have to offer!",

Right in the middle of the Strip District is Wholey's. It is really a fish market, often crowded, and not always spotless, but keep walking in and you will see heaven for any fish sandwich lover. I have been there more times than I recall. It is always great. It is always the same. The fired fish is just so tasty. It is not even close to healthy, but who cares, it is wonderful. The seating is very limited so be ready to stand, or take a walk with your food. There is some seating with stools but don't count on it. The prices are fair. The service is friendly. Go there.",

A train track above was cool bc the train is running.  The Cod sandwich was excellent, and I ordered the junior size (4 oz) and that was plenty for me for $3. , otherwise it's $5. for the regular size (that must be alot).  Also, the Boston clam chowder soup (8 oz) for $3, it was one of best I had.  Order the soup and sandwich special for $6. you get soup, sandwich and a drink. They have pkg of tarter sauce and hot sauce.  I went back another day and tried their crab cakes, but I didn't like it as much.  It was tasty, but greasy and smelled of oil.   I enjoyed the fish sandwich much better.  Crab cakes were 2 for $5.    Also, I tried the crab and lobster bisque soup and that was pretty good too!  There was bits of lobster and crab in the soup.  I prefer the clam chowder bc I love clams!  Prices were very reasonable and I would go back again.",

There's an enormous variety of fish here, but other fish markets in the Strip that don't necessarily have the variety of Wholey's beat it soundly in terms of consistent quality and consistent freshness of the fish.  Some of the fish that is offered is good and very fresh, but some of the other fish doesn't look great to me -- the eyes are dull and clouded, etc.  Another reviewer said to \"be prepared for the smell, but that's what you expect in a fish market.\"  I agree that Wholey's fish department smells of overripe fish, but I disagree that that is acceptable in a fish market.  Other fish markets in town do not smell of rotten fish.  Wholey's is also pretty crowded, and tries to do too many things at one time.  I think it could be a good fish market if it was not also trying to be a restaurant, a meat market, and a grocery store.  On the whole, you can get some good buys here, but you have to be very aware of exactly what you're buying.",

Delicious, light cod on a Mancini bun is HEAVEN for only $7.  Bring a coffee from PrestoGeorge (next door) and you're set.  The upstairs seating is a bit dated and cheesy, but I love it!    This weekend we picked up some frozen pre-cooked shrimp -- always good -- and stumbled across some AMAZING trout.   Deboned except for the spine.   The fishmonger chopped off the heads for us.  For dinner last night we sauteed them in butter and some seasonings and, for $5 each, we had a meal that would have cost $30 each in one of the upscale restaurants in town.

Just can't get anything like this in Northern California (although it's hard to beat our local salmon and dungeness crab), and the Wisconsin suppliers have been out.

We ordered the 3 pound package at a very fair price, and we are accustomed to paying air freight for specialty foods.  We spoke directly to Dan Wholey, who was totally helpful, and we received the most awesome personal service -- and our fish arrived the following day.  It was smoky with firm flesh -- and not mushy.  On a buttered bagel -- superb!  Saw some other fish that we will consider in the future: crawfish tails, Atlantic lobster.

    "text": "It pains me to write a two-star review of this large fish market in the Strip District. When you walk in, there's just so much variety from different kinds of fish, shellfish, and other such fishy delights to a good selection of frozen goods, spices, and ready-to-eat crab cakes. However, despite the criminally low prices on the live Maine lobsters (the best deal in the entire store), I was put off by the cloudy live fish tanks and the fact that there was a lot of seafood on display that was frozen (being so close to Maryland, there's no real need for frozen crab). Floors are slippery so keep an eye out, and remember-- a good fishmonger WILL let you touch the product to test for freshness and texture; they should also be able to tell you where the fish comes from and whether it was wild, farmed, or line caught. So get that grocery list ready and make sure to ask questions. Seafood is tasty-- it doesn't need to be the next mystery meat.",

There is a small room upstairs where you eat, not fancy at all but definitely a nice place to have a quick sandwich when you are in a hurry and need a bite to eat!",

    "text": "While it is called a fish market it is much more.  Fresh seafood and fish, a large meat department including some more exotic meats, some veggies, candy and fudge, Andy's Sushi Bar and the Wholey's Kitchen for a good seafood sandwich or entree.  Now this is really a large warehouse so don't expect any style points.  Just good fresh seafood.   Have shopped at Wholey's for years mostly for seafood but from time to time have stopped in the Kitchen for a meal.   Just wander up the stairs after you get your order for a table and they have some hot sauce, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce and a lot of tables that someone puts down fresh white paper after every use.   Today I stopped for lunch and decided to get the Sea-bak Shrimp Burger, a new treat for Lent by Rick Sebak that is chopped shrimp with cornmeal, some lemon juice and whatever to keep it together topped with a nice mango chutney that has some habanero pepper on Mancini bread.  A nice change from the fried cod or crab that I usually get and tasty.  Not sure I would want the Sea-bak weekly but a good change of pace.",

Keep in mind this is a seafood market with a cafeteria style order station so don't expect waiters and white cloth on the table. They do put white paper sheet on the table if that makes you feel better ;).   I wish this place would steam shrimp, crab legs or lobster. I would dine here more often if that was ever an option.   BTW - There is a privately own sushi stand inside and everything I ever got from there was super delicious",

They sell fresh pork and chicken as well as other things. I was really surprised at how many different kinds of sea food there was. Not only that, but everyone here was very friendly and patient because I came in not knowing exactly what I wanted. I was looking for a particular fish I had when I was younger and they were very helpful. I got two huge pieces of king crab legs and they were so tasty. The fresh lobster rolls were amazing as well. The lines were so busy so I couldn't try their hot food but I'll be back for that. I liked watching them cut up the fish. I thought that was so interesting.

Not too crazy about all the fried foods, but the cod was spot on. I ordered the Wholey Moley which was 1 lb of Icelandic Cod: Perfect!   They have an upstairs area where you can enjoy your food.

I initially would come here only when I needed steaks and seafood items, but now visit much more frequently to check out their produce, fresh squeezed orange juice (which is the BEST around), deli options, etc. I also love the interactive displays in the grocery store- makes it so much fun to bring kids here. If you come to the Strip and you didn't stop at Wholey's... did you even go to the Strip?!",

It's not only one of my favorite places to buy sushi grade fish and seafood and the occasional meat from their butcher dept; I  go to eat their famous fish sandwich and get some made to order sushi from Andy's sushi bar as well. There is a dining room upstairs with plenty of seating available.   It is one of my go to spots to bring out of town visitors to get a great feel of Pittsburgh. Love love love this place and can't imagine giving it less than five stars.",

We'll also frequently opt for the lobster crab bisque, fried shrimp, and/or lobster mac and cheese. In addition, we almost invariably come home with some of the mac and cheese and bisque to go!  The fried seafood is cooked perfectly - not too oily, not too dry, and delicious with any of the sauces they offer. Mac and cheese and bisque are great too, though a little rich for my taste.  Aside from the prepared foods, it's your typical seafood market and grocery store with pretty reasonable prices. We're usually only in town a few days, though, so we don't typically buy anything aside from the prepared foods.",

Most of them are 4 for $5!  That's crazy cheap ($1.25 each).  I'm used to paying $3-$5 for a little jar of spices.  These aren't the 1\" diameter by 1.5\" tall jars.  They're more like 1.5\" diameter by 4\" tall bottles.  We bought a lot of spices.  For sure, before I move out of Pgh, I'm going to stock up on spices from Wholey.",

    "text": "It is really hard for me to review Wholey's in one post because I am not sure what the store is trying to be.  Is it a modern fish market? Is it a grocery store?  I would just like Wholey's to choose an identity and strive to be great at it.    I was always taught that a good fish market shouldn't smell fishy. Too many times Wholey's smells like the inside of my tackle box. The fish selection at Wholey's is greater than your normal supermarket but not what I would expect from a top notch fish market. I am not a big fan of all of their processed frozen fish product.  Also the the quality to price ratio seems to be a little off.  With that said there are deals to be had if you pay attention.  My other issue is with Wholey's as a full service fish monger.  Every time I have had a question about a type of fish the staff had seemed pretty ignorant.  I would put them at the level of a giant eagle employee but lower than the monger at Whole Foods.  I also  take issue with Wholey's charging for scaling or even taking the fins and tail off of a fish.  This has been complimentary at any real fish monger that I have ever been to.  This weekend I purchased 2 pounds of the ocean perch filets that were on sale thinking that they would be a quick ingredient for a dinner party that I was hosting. Today, when I went to pull them out, I found to my dismay, that they were poorly butchered.  Every filet had large portions that had not been scaled completely and the filets had bones (not pin bones) hanging off the bottom. This added over an hour to my prep time and left me quite unsatisfied. If I had wanted to take the time to break a fish down I would have purchased whole fish from the start.  Needless to say I expected more from one of Pittsburgh's premier fish mongers. I also emailed Wholey's and have still not received a response.    Will I go back? Probably. But only because they are the only place that I can pork belly that is not frozen  Just be aware that there are better fish mongers in Pittsburgh and even in the Strip.",

Like every time I've made them and brought them to a party I get at least a few people saying they Are the best ribs they've ever had awesome. It's a decent fish market for a landlocked city like Pittsburgh but after living in the DC area and visiting markets in the DMV, I'm afraid I've been a bit spoiled. And I'm not sure why it smells so fishy all of the time- it's not like that at fish markets down my way. It's frequently very crowded because in this are, unless you want to pay Giant Eagle prices for seafood (uhh, no thank you!), this is it. The produce is actually of good quality for being so cheap so take a look at that while stopping in. This is a Pittsburgh tradition so I highly applaud the efforts here, and I do recommend at least taking a walk through if you're in the Strip. Oh, and buy the ribs to make at home, just trust me.",

They even provide you with bags of ice, which was needed for my crab claws and Chilean sea bass 6 hour trip back to NYC. Now every time I visit this is where I stock up on my monthly food supply, although they have informed me that they will ship to my location.

    "text": "Sorry Wholey's I really hate to do because I love your grocery store (4 stars in it own right) but your prepared food just wasn't that good.  I have now been to Wholey's twice recently to have their food and eat upstairs.  The most recent of those visits was this weekend at around 3:30 PM whenever I stopped in for a quick bite and the time before that was two Tuesdays prior for lunch with my father.  What is weird is that I have been shopping in Wholey's for years and never knew that they had a cafeteria type line with prepared food.  Somehow I always found myself turning to the right immediately upon entering and looking at all of the different types of fish.  However, if you end up turning to the left then you are able to go through a prepared food line that probably resembles the one back in your old high school cafeteria.  The first time that I ended up eating here I went with the crab cakes lunch combo which consisted of two crab cakes, a large side of fries, a small tub of cole slaw and a drink all for right around $9.  With that price I was not too surprised that the crab cakes were fairly small but at least they were tasty.  The fries were also tasty as they had some type of seasoning on them that I really enjoyed but the bad part was that they were cold.  Last but not least in the meal was the cole slaw which was decent and unremarkable.  After this visit I probably would have given a solid 3 star review but I didn't get this review finished before I stopped by here again.  The second time I ended up ordering the whiting sandwich on a mancinis wheat bun.  What is nice is that you have a choice between 3 different buns, two mancinis (white or wheat) and another regular bun.  They also really heap the fish onto your sandwich for the price.  Whenever I started eating the fish I thought it was weird that some bites of the fish were super fishy while other bites were mild and more of what I was expecting.  That I could have accepted but what really turned me off of the sandwich was the five or so pin bones that I found when biting into the one side of a piece of fish.  Yes I understand that a pin bone of two happens every now and again but it seemed like this one piece of fish really hadn't been cleaned properly before it was breaded and fried.  The bottom line for me is that even with a not so great last experience I will still head back here again in the future.  I really love shopping for fish, meat and produce here and feel like they have some of the best selections and prices around.  Due to that I am sure that I will give their cafeteria another chance but I will most certainly be avoiding the fish sandwich.",

You're coming here because you're serious about fish!  But not only will you find fresh fish here, but you'll also find really cheap fresh produce too!  I feel like that's a little known fact.  It may be a challenge if you're just going for the cheap produce and can't stand the smell of fish though...so bring the nose plugs.    I love coming here in the summer when I want to grill out.  I stop in for the fresh tuna steak and shrimp.  This is the place to go to get big portions and half the cost of Giant Eagle, and you know it's going to be good and worth it!    On the off months it's nice to come in to grab a nice fishy lunch (hello fish sammie!) or stop in for sushi at Andy's Sushi Bar (see Andy's Sushi Bar review!).  Seriously, if you're a fish lover, you really must come in here!  You'll obviously be okay with the fish smell then...non-fish lovers beware.  Don't say I didn't warn you!",

Unfortunately, I tried neither. The fried fish seasoning has MSG in it. Then I decided to just do sushi. Well the guy who was preparing it was also collecting money. Needless to say, he did rinse his hands under water... Smh. Sir, you have to use soap and water then rinse for at least 20 seconds!  Nonetheless, I'm still giving this place three stars, because my mother-in-law enjoyed her fish. I hope she enjoyed that headache too from the MSG!!

Def worth a few bucks and a moment.    there is a sushi stand right inside. FTW!...you cant get fresher sushi than that.  Huge selection of fresh as well as frozen seafood.  Big lobster tanks.  Friendly service.  Lots of well maintained seating if you wanna grab a sammy or some mac and cheese.",

AND you can have it delivered just about anywhere packed in dry ice. That's right. I had a box of lobsters and steaks delivered to my front door in Georgia. Good stuff.",

    "text": "I feel like a Pirate!  Well not really but I decided to head there for their 100 yr anniversary.   It was my first time and I was impressed if I wanted to buy some fresh fish.  I took my buddy there who was from out of town to share the experience.   We joined the line to order our food that started out the door.   I was confused because there is a Sushi Line and a separate line for the cooked variety.  One of the rubs - they were out of many things (Calamari, shrimp, etc...)    I could not try the assortment I wanted.  I ordered.  We received an abudance of food.    The fish was cooked very well.   The sides were done very well.  A second rub was the atmosphere.  You are in a fish market where they sell fresh fish.   After about 10 minutes in line, the smell is not the best (atleast for my appetite).    Once we received our food, we waited to pay (food getting cooler by the minute).  We paid and made the trek upstairs to eat.  I will do it again, I am sure.",

Recently I tried the clam strips, oh they were so fantastic.  My husband, a native Burgher, is all about the Shrimp Po Boy.   Second - the bread, oh that bread is wonderful, it adds so much character to an already awesome sandwich with super fresh fish. Lastly - portion size, I am full when I leave. they give huge pieces of fish.",

    "text": "Wholey Fish Market, Batman!  Actually, there's a whole(y) lot more than just fish here, but seafood is clearly their area of expertise.  I knew I liked Wholey's before husband and I even entered the building.  As we walked up, a cart on the sidewalk beckoned with glistening oysters on the half-shell, expertly and efficiently shucked by one worker, comically hawked by another wearing a huge chef's hat and heckling passersby via a lobster bullhorn.  (You had to be there.)  At $1 a pop  -- or $5 for a half dozen -- husband and I didn't waste a moment and were soon slurping a fat, juicy, delicious Chesapeake Bay oyster on the bustling sidewalk.  A great intro to Wholey's.  Inside we were dazzled by the endless array of beautiful fresh and frozen seafood, everything from tuna steaks to Jonah crab.  Near the entrance Wholey's sushi chef was hard at work.  At the back we watched lobsters and live fish swimming in huge tanks.  Extending farther down the block was Wholey's meat section, featuring baby back ribs, whole chickens, pork chops.  Beyond that, even, we discovered the produce section.  Peppered throughout the market were gourmet chips, dried fruits and veggies for snacking, seafood condiments.....you can spend a vast amount of time wandering, eyes agog.  And we did.  After wandering husband and I knew we needed to sample some of the hot food.  We weren't ravenously hungry, tho, so we chose the random pairing of a small crab and lobster mac 'n' cheese and a side of hush puppies (husband is obsessed), and made our way upstairs to the dining room.  This banquet-hall like space was pretty ugly and old-school, but an experience nonetheless.  Hush puppies (a *generous* serving) were bite-size nuggets with crunchy, crispy exteriors and soft, tender middles.  Dipping them in Wholey's homemade tartar and cocktail sauces enhanced them further.  The mac 'n' cheese was enjoyable, too, with nice big chunks of wild-caught lobster and crab meat.    I'm already looking forward to a return trip to Pittsburgh: I've got Wholey's fish sammie in my sights.  And next time I'll bring a cooler.  [15 Minutes of Fame: \"Man v. Food\" (The Wholey Whaler)]",

The poor fish wanted out of his mediocre environment.  No worries though a staff member threw it back in the tank.  I purchased some tilapia and gulf shrimp.  I could not find soy sauce on the shelves. When I thought soy sauce is a common enough ingredient.  I always make it a point to stop into Wholey's when I am in the Strip.",

    "text": "Probably the best place to buy fish in Pittsburgh; Don't buy at wall mart or giant eagle there fish stuff sits around. Believe me I've tasted the difference; At Wholey's they keep their fish clean and fresh.   Their grocery is really fresh and well taken care of. The place is run very clean and the staff are very nice and helpful. The fish selection is excellent if you want bass salmon lobster or eel they have it. They even have this toy train track that runs all along the store very gimmicky I loved it, it even keeps the kids distracted while I shop! Very Pittsburgh  They even offer to clean, scale removal, and cut the fish any way you want it. These are great services as for a cook these things are tiring and time consuming.   I highly recommend this place to any smart foodies, shoppers, cooks.",
