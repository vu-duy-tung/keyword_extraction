It's not a big Restaraunt, but it felt like they only had 1 person working. Aside from our party there weren't many people dinning there. Our waitress took forever refilling our drinks and we waited almost an hour for food. I know people who love the place and swear by it, but it wasn't my thing, and definitely not the greatest Italian I have had.",

You know it is bad when your lips burn. Normaly I find the dishes over salted , but can tolerate it. Next time I have to remember to ask them to hold the salt.",

Food is better than the Olive Garden and there is rarely a wait. The building needs a bit of work but I go there to get a good meal at a very reasonable price not for the decor.",

The a/c was cold so we asked the owner where the warmest place to sit was....his ignorant nasty reply was \"The parking lot\". I then smiled and said \"shes from Florida so she's cold (meaning her blood was thinner\"...to that he replied \"Go back to Florida then\". I still had hoped he was joking. My friend from Fl. Is Italian herself so fussy about her italian food. We met up with a childhood friend...we are all in our 60's...so we laughed and had a great time. Our waitress was slow (20. Min for our soft drinks) but pleasant & enjoyable. We had an appetizer and full course meals. After dinner we continued to sit and talk as there were plenty of empty tables. The owner started giving us dirty looks so we told our server that if he needed the table,we'd leave. We were assured we were fine so once again,we ordered dessert & coffee. As soon as we were done,the owner physically came over and asked us to leave. For probably 25 yrs we have gone there, including big table reservations for Mothers Day etc. Never again will this man get my families business or anyone that I can share this with. He needs to keep his miserable self home & let his family run it. Up until this,even though its in need of updating,we continued going there. He no longer needs my business. He responded on his FB page that he offered to move us to the bar and buy us a drink...he also said there was a line. None of that was True.",

He ambles around, seems to know everyone and will talk and keep you engaged if you are sitting at the bar alone.  Ok so he isn't in the category of Valozzi- but the good news is this place provides a reasonable and very tasty Italian meal that won't require you to take out a loan.I just finished spaghetti and meatballs- a portion so large I'm taking 3/4 home.  My wife had veal Romano - one of the few places in town that doesn't ruin it.  It's buttery,crispy, light and tender.  Do stop if you are near Jefferson Hospital.  Just down the road on 51.  I've been coming for years and the quality and taste is consistent.  We love you Frank!",

Expect delicious perfectly crafted home made Italian food with massive portions, reasonable prices, a charming, cozy restaurant and very friendly staff.  All entrees include an amazing mixed salad that's big enough to be an entree by itself.  The red peppers stuffed with sausage, crab stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini with marina appetizers are particularly recommended, but my group of 4 didn't try one thing they didn't love.  The biggest complaints I can come up with are the tables are a tad small and I wish it was closer to my house.  Then again, I might move just to be closer.  To Ciccanti I must shout, BRAVISSIMO!",

First thing I noticed is that this place hasn't had a remodel since the 80s. Tacky wallpaper, crooked paintings on the walls and pretty dim lighting. Service was prompt. Our waitress was very nice, but neglected to mention to my wife and I the the daily specials. Only after we were about to leave the restaurant did we hear our waitress mention them to another party. We had garlic bread (excellent) minestrone soup ( also excellent) house salads and bruschetta. The soups are  homemade and absolutely delicious. The bruschetta was wonderful. No skimping on the portions there. Then my wife and I had our entrees. She had veal Frankie. Veal in a lemon sauce with artichokes and other vegetables. The veal was good, but the artichokes weren't properly cleaned and the hard outer shell of the artichokes ruined the dish. I had tripe. One of my favorite dishes if cooked correctly, but horribly horribly disappointing if the chef doesn't know what he's doing! Our chef hasn't a clue what he was doing. Tripes supposed to be gamy, but this tripe tasted like it came out of a barn. It wasn't pleasant at all. All I could smell and taste as I pushed through a few pieces was horse manure. Very disappointed! If only we'd have ordered soup, salad and bruschetta!",

You get Italian bread or garlic bread (we got both). I had the eggplant mozzarella & husband got the manicotti. We were very pleased. Came out hot and fresh. My eggplant was lightly breaded to perfection. The homemade sauce is FANTASTIC. My husband got the homemade tiramisu (which I nibbled on). Also very good.

Everything is homemade from a chef straight from Italy, Frank Ciccanti and his sons as this is a family run business. The Marinara sauce is to die for and you can buy it by the quart to go. The chicken Romano and veal mozzarella are delicious and both come with a side of pasta or vegetable and soup and salad. The homemade minestrone and chicken pastina soups are also delicious.  There are many appetizers including mozzarella sticks, artichokes alla Romano and fried zucchini which I would highly recommend.  He has daily specials and everything is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. The wait staff makes you feel at home. I would recommend if you go on a Friday or Saturday evening after 5 pm that you make a reservation as they get very busy.",

It wasn't. On my first visit our server brought out champaign glasses with an inch of water in them and had no idea how to open the bottle of champagne. Then disappeared for most of the meal. That seems to be the going trend with this place. I've had under cooked pasta, stale bread, dry chicken and egg shell in deserts. I feel they are over priced and not worth the $20 they charge for a basic dish. This is not a place I will be visiting again. I tried I really did but in the end I always left disappointed.",

My husband has been cooking for over 40 years concurred with me.  The owner/chef choose to disagree with me and said it was the prosciutto and melted cheese that made the chicken appear raw,  no it was raw.  I also had pasta with a red sauce that was burnt.  I did not complain as the owner, Frank, already argued about the chicken.  Frank should have been less concerned with the front of the house staff and more concerned with the back of the house.   The wait staff were  great and I do not blame them for my meal.  In the end I did have chicken parmigiana which was just OK.  My husband had one of the specials that again was OK.",

    "text": "I was staying in West Mifflin for two nights and was looking for a local restaurant to eat at instead of all the chains.  The hotel recommended this place and gave me directions.  Of course I had to check the other reviews on Yelp first so an average of 4 stars gave this a good shot of being something speclal.  Walking into the place, it's one of those places where the decor has not been updated in about 40 years.  You walk into the bar area first.  The wallpaper is dark, there's a bar in the middle and a few booths off to the far wall.  The carpeting does not match the walls.  There's also a dining room back beyond the bar.  I sat myself at the bar.  I was instantly greeted by the bartender.  I asked for a local beer.  She didn't know which ones were local so I opted for Yuengling which is PA based but still not local to that area.   On with the menu.  Lots of Italian options here and they also had 4 specials as well.  Prices were very reasonable.  And your meal comes with soup, salad, and bread.   The minestrone soup was delicious and contained lots of chunks of different vegetables.  The salad consisted of lettuce, chick peas, beets, carrots and tomatoes all perfectly arranged on the plate.  Mine came with the house vinagrette dressing which was simple yet very tasty.  Reminded me of a dressing at a place in my hometown.  For an entree, I ordered Chicken Frankie which was sauteed chicken breast with artichokes, olives in a lemon butter sauce.  Very tasty as well but the portion was just so huge that I couldn't finish half of it.  For dessert, I opted for a cannoli to go which I didn't really care for but wanted to try something other than cheesecake and tiramisu.  It was worth trying anyway.  Overall a great meal with great service.  Like some of the other reviewers, I had the opportunity to talk with the owner.  These local places are the ones who really appreciate your business so I make an effort to seek them out.",

Really, it's one of the only good local restaurants in the south hills that's riddled with chain bombs.  This is the ONLY place I will order chicken Romano. The very best. Thin pieces of chicken lightly fried in an egg batter. Meat based entrees come with soup, salad and choice of pasta or veg of day. Those are a meal without even touching the the entree. Very fair prices.  Best food choices: Pork Chops Campanola style.  Add hot peppers if you like the heat.  Chicken Romano Linguini with clam (I prefer the white sauce.) Fried zucchini appetizer...thin, thin, thin slices! Stuffed olive appetizer Any veal dish can be subbed with chicken.  I prefer the tomato sauce to the marinara.   Is the decor a bit old style? Yes, but that's what I feel adds to the charm of the old style Italian food. In the south hills of Pittsburgh, this is a must go.",

It was very flavorful and the not over cooked.  The salad was a little bland, iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, a couple of olives, chick peas, beets,carrots and a pepper.  The bread was one step away from white bread and the house wine was OK.  The 4 stars came from the main course.  I had veal parmesan and a side of pasta.  The sauce was amazing.  It made the meal. There are very few places where the base sauce is this good.  My meal with a glass of house wine came to $25 and change.  Well worth it. I will be back when I am in the area .",

Driving past the this non chalant looking restaurant on Route 51 you would never think twice about the amazing food inside. The inside has been updated but isn't lavish and can be enjoyed on any day of the week.  This food was all homemade, and tasted like my it from an Italian family's dinner. The food and service was phenomenal - and I will be back for dinner in the future! We had roasted chicken, ham, rigatoni, salad, green beans and roasted potatoes. I will suggest their homemade pasta , while Frank (1st generation Italian) no longer cooks he oversees his sons cooking to make sure everything is authentic and made correctly. The service was great and the food came out on time.   Food for Thought If this place would update the interior and do some advertising - I don't think you'd be able to get in the door. As it is, don't miss this delicious \"secret\" homemade dining experience! You won't regret it!",

I do not recommend the chicken dish called frank, it simply looked like boiled chicken,  had an overwhelming taste of lemon, very little artichoke or olive.  One of the girls at work ordered a steak salad, it came with soup and looked fairly large.  The owners are so cute, they definitely stand out greeting their guests throughout the dining area creating a homie feel that you simply can't get at a chain.",

And, to top it off, I guarantee you won't leave hungry.  Portion sizes are great, and you get great accompaniments with your meal.  Usually get bread & butter or Garlic Bread, a salad, a cup of soup, and your side with your meal...all with a big bowl of freshly grated parm cheese.  For what you are getting, and the quality of it, I have no complaints with the price.      I highly recommend their freshly breaded fried zucchini and mozz cheese as appetizers.  The minestrone is phenomenal and is REAL.    For dinner, honestly, anything that looks good to you.  I've never had anything bad.  My go to, however, is their Chicken Scallopini.  My kids love their giant, wonderful Rav's.    Desserts are great, as well.  The decor is, well, very outdated.. but--I don't go here to stare at the walls.  I go here to eat.  And, as I stated, i've never been disappointed.",

I would recommend it to anyone that likes steak and Italian food. Hey use to sell their pasta sauce at the uncommon market, it closed unfortunately- bless its soul",

    "text": "We had been looking forward to coming here for a while, so our hopes were high. However, immediately upon entering the restaurant, those hopes started to dwindle. The entrance had no discernible hostess stand or signage indicating where to go. While we waited for someone to greet us, I noticed the outdated decor including dusty plastic flowers and shabby carpets.  After we were finally escorted to our table, we were given the choice of either regular bread or garlic bread. My boyfriend (an unabashed garlic bread enthusiast) instantly perked up. Sadly, though, we were disappointed by the appearance of soggy bread with zero crunch and nonexistent garlic flavor. You know that revolting texture of bread that's come in contact with water? Yeah. That.   My salad was a bizarre combination of iceberg lettuce, canned beets, garbanzo beans, shredded carrots, and one lonely tomato slice. The \"chicken\" noodle soup had no chicken in it and was only improved by adding heaps of Parmesan cheese to it. Oh, and did I mention that my salad had a hair in it?   Now for the entrees.... You would think that if an old school Italian restaurant should excel at anything, it should be their sauce. Nope. Not this place. Far too acidic and no depth of flavor. Just watery pureed tomatoes. The eggplant Parmesan was soggy and bland. The manicotti was passable but unremarkable. After the first few bites of our entrees, we both looked at each other knowingly and agreed that we would not be back.   When the ranch dressing is the highlight of your meal, you know it's bad. Do better, Ciccanti.",

They do a nice job here for hosting a fairly large private party.   While it is a bit outdated you're not coming here for trendy ambiance, but for a good meal served by friendly people.",

Frank and Theresa, the owners, always stop out for a hello, and service is always friendly and attentive.   The best part is you can buy a jar of their pasta sauce to take home!",
