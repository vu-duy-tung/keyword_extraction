Not too spicy, but the sauce is really good. Soups are excellent here and the restaurant is really nice inside. Fast service and lots of seating. Not my favorite Chinese spot, but very good place to go or at least try if you are in the area. It is located right off of McKnight road next to TGI Fridays.",

We have gone there on two different weekends for Dim Sum and both times, the food was really good.  The wait staff was disappointing. There were only two adults in our party and we ordered 6 dishes. The waitress asked, \"Is that it?\" with a rather snotty attitude. In general she seemed rather annoyed that we arrived at 11:15am and interrupted her vacuuming. The bar area was also still being cleaning from the night before. If this place can add a couple more Dim Sum dishes and get their waitresses to be a little more pleasant; they should be able to lure lots of customers from the Chinese Church that is less than 2 minutes away.",

    "text": "Was visiting my husband's family in Pittsburgh and my in-laws kindly took us to dinner at Empire, having eaten there twice before. Sadly, the food this time was TERRIBLE - a complete insult to Chinese cuisine.   Everything was battered, deep fried and then smothered in overly salty, goopy brown sauces. Here's a recap of our dishes:  Our cold noodles appetizer was disgusting: a mushy mess of lomein with a watery sesame sauce that tasted like cheap salad dressing.   I had the ginger chicken: essentially processed \"meat-product\" swimming in a sickeningly sweet sauce.   Hubbie had sizzling beef with scallops: the beef and scallops were again mushy, like they were boiled, NOT sauteed or browned. The onions were half cooked, half raw. The sizzling plate was luke-warm. It was so bad we had to send it back.  My SIL had cashew chicken. It was served without the cashews! Our waiter eventually brought out a dish of cashews, but instead of being toasted, they were raw.   My father in law had \"Mala Triples\" (never heard of it, by the way, even though I'm ethnically Chinese!) As soon has he stepped out of the car, he was puking into the bushes of the front yard.   On top of that:  - we were charged for 3 pots of tea, even though we were only served 2.  - water tasted really wonky, with a faint taste of petrol/dishwasher detergent. Lovely.  - the greeter lady was \"busy\" greeting a friend and ignored our party. After we finally got her attention, she got blatantly annoyed when we asked NOT be seated to a huge, loud table.  I guess when you spend all your money decking out your business in tacky blue chandeliers and gaudy glass panes emblazoned with the city skyline, one should not expect too highly of the food and service.",

They offer a handful of dim sum items.  All of them were a bit pricy and average in the taste department.  Dim sum are plates of little bites and usually are in the $2.50 to $3.50 range.  Each dim sum item was around $5 and tasted just so-so.  We also ordered the Honey Moon Duck at $17.  A sickeningly sweet sauce accompanying a little tasty duck.    Also went with some sushi for the kids (California Roll) for $5.  Pretty tiny pieces in the roll - but still hard to screw this up.  The kids ate it.  The combination Lo Mein ($11) was tasty enough - a little on the greasy side but still tasty.  The bill came in on the hefty side but it was a chance to check out our options for dim sum.  We left disappointed and a little lighter in the wallet.  We won't be coming back.",

We always sit at the bar (that's our thing no matter what restaurant we're in lol) and usually have the same bartender, Chad. Or Chett, I can never understand when he says it. Either way, he's a very nice guy and pretty knowledgeable on the sushi and small craft brew selection that they have there.  I usually get the same roll over and over again (eel roll FTW!), but my boyfriend always tries out something new and I'll usually snag a few pieces off of his plate. I have never had a problem with the sushi there; it is quite delicious. I have also had the miso soup, which was definitely one of the best I have had in any restaurant. Their wonton soup is also quite delicious.  The decor seems a little weird to me, but it doesn't turn me off or anything. All of the employees who I have engaged with thus far are quite nice and friendly. The food is delivered in a timely fashion and the chips with duck sauce are super tasty. If you're in the area, I definitely recommend checking them out.",

The food is really good, I have tried some items that I wouldn't order again, but I think that was a matter of taste, not that it was prepared poorly.  The Sushi is really good, I highly recommend the Pink Lady Roll, so so delicious. The atmosphere is good, and go in the Womens bathroom if you can (ladies only), cause it is the nicest bathroom I have seen in a restaurant in a long time. Guys, never been in the Men's let us know what you think.  The other reviewers have mentioned that the place is never full. The reason, is that the parking lot is not big enough for it to be full.TGI Fridays shares the lot with Empire  Palace, but most people don't realize that they can park over there. So really is hardly ever a wait to be seated.  Great stuff, every time I want some good Chinese we go there. Word of caution, the food does not travel well. Delivery is not as good as in the restaurant.",

I did notice however, when you get takeout - the portions don't seem to be as large as when you dine in and the service could be better (the wait staff is not friendly at all) so for those two reasons I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.  If I had to rate on food alone then it would be 5 stars.  The chicken and broccoli is the best dish on the menu!  The decor inside is very nice too.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

You'll find a selection of sushi and, while I don't enjoy sushi myself, the spicy crab rolls were rather good. I recommend the General Tso's or Amazing Chicken.

I really do not like it when due to the waiter or waitress not understanding English, they mess up the prder, than blame the customer.  So, very pleased with that.  The food was also excellent.  We both had different variations of the lamb.  Both very good.  Came with fried rice, which had an excellent flavor,  Wanted the Peking Duck, but at $32.00 I was assuming it would be for two poeple, but there was the langiuage barrier again, and the waitress stating, well, something I did not understand.  So, no loss.    Also, very nicely decorated inside.  Overall, a very good experience.  Will definitely go back for the lunch.  They have a three roll with soup sushi lunch special that is cheap.  I really want to try it.",

    "text": "Empire Palace is a great  lunch spot in the North Hills and a worthy competitor to, say, Sesame Inn.  It's got your typical Chinese lunch menu which includes hot & sour soup or egg roll and fried or steamed rice with your entree.  But the quality of food here seems to be a cut above what you'd typically expect.    Eschewing my normal preferences for chicken, I went for the sliced pork with vegetables.  I have to say that the pork was very tender and the vegetables very crisp (I've had 'em elsewhere when they've been overcooked).  And of course I had my egg roll!  So Empire Palace may have a standard Americanized Chinese luncheon menu, but they do it very well.",

    "text": "We recently moved further north and discovered that Empire Palace is now our nearest Chinese restaurant. I couldn't be more pleased. So far we've eaten in once and gotten delivery once, and both experiences were great.  First, the atmosphere: We ate in the restaurant fairly early on a Sunday evening. They were surprisingly busy, but service was efficient and friendly (though I wouldn't have minded faster refills on my water). The interior is comfortable, and we felt relaxed and enjoyed our meal.  Delivery, when I ordered for weekday lunch, was astonishingly fast; 20 minutes, I think, and the food arrived fresh and hot. The woman who took my order on the phone was helpful and repeated my order to make sure it was correct (I always appreciate this), AND they sent plasticware, chopsticks, and sauces. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't send any accoutrements with your delivery order.  So, the food! On our first visit, we ordered a California Roll (look, my sushi allowances are limited these days), Amazing Chicken, and Bride & Groom, along with wonton soup. The soup's broth had a good depth of flavor and was accented by scallions, although the wontons were lackluster. The California roll was excellent, with not-cold rice, fresh avocado, and toasted nori.  Amazing Chicken turned out to be, well, amazing; lightly breaded and fried and served with plenty of garlicky, slightly spicy, sweet sauce. \"Authentic,\" whatever that means anymore? Well, no. It did remind me of a Chinese home cooking recipe for honey garlic pork chops, though, and it was really excellent. Both my husband and I agreed we'd have this again. Made some really good leftovers, too.  The Bride & Groom was reasonably tasty, although I only tried a small piece of both the beef and the chicken. The beef had a musky, beefy flavor to it that doesn't appeal to me right now, but my husband enjoyed it.  For delivery, we ordered Lemon Chicken, General Tso's Shrimp, more wonton soup, and an eggroll.  The Lemon Chicken did not thrill either of us, being breaded with breadcrumbs (yuck) and with a sauce that tasted a bit like cough drops. Not a favorite.  The General Tso's Shrimp, though, was quite good, with plenty of large shrimp even in the lunch portion. I'd have liked it to have been a little spicier, but I will request that next time. It also featured mushrooms, peppers, and snow peas.  The eggroll was good, if not great. Oh, and in all cases, the steamed rice was perfect. Just sticky enough; not too soggy, and not crunchy. That's important.  Overall, I'm extremely happy having Empire Palace as \"our\" Chinese restaurant. I can't wait to try some of the dim sum, particularly the turnip cake, which has always been a favorite.",

The staff is friendly and helpful. You get free tea and wontons to munch on when you come in while you look over the menu. I always appreciated that small thing, but it makes you feel like you're well taken care of. Which they definitely do!  The restaurant is always clean and looks very nice. They have a lot of tables to handle large groups if needed.  I am always amazed at how much food you get. I always bring home leftovers and can eat for a couple of days on one of their meals. I am especially excited by the fact that they have very reasonable prices. You have to try very hard to get a dinner for two of more than $20 (keep in mind most dishes are big enough to share).  An excellent place, highly recommended.",

I've eaten at the restaurant a few times and it has never been full even during peak hours, but I think they do a healthy amount of takeout. While the quality and quantity have shrunk a bit since they first open several years ago, it is still a solid, safe option.   My typical order includes Empire Cold Noodles (their take on cold sesame noodles with peanut sauce) and the Amazing Chicken (their take on General Tso's with a less sweet and more flavorful sauce). For vegetables, they also make pretty good green beans and eggplant.",

    "text": "I've been actively avoiding this place for several years now because I thought it was a greasy, take out place, but man, was I wrong!!!  This place gives my other favorite local upscale Chinese place a run for their money.  We started with the PuPu Platter and it was served exactly the way it should be, with a flame in the center.  The BBQ spareribs were deliciously seasoned, fried shrimp nicely crispy with no grease, and the crab rangoons were soooo yummy.  The only part I wasn't a huge fan of were the egg rolls we substituted for the typical spring rolls.  Very fresh, but with very long pieces of cabbage that were a little messy and difficult to chew.  For my meal, I ordered the Orange Beef Dinner size portion.  Holy moly, lots of food!  The sauce was nicely balanced, the sweetness of the orange with a little heat mixed in.  I ordered brown rice which was also cooked well, slightly nuttier flavor which soaked up the orange beef sauce nicely.  The only negative aspect of my food will sound odd, but the pieces of beef were huge!!  If you plan on eating with chopsticks, it is going to be a difficult experience!  Most pieces had to be cut into 2-3 bite size pieces for consumption.  The decor was very clean and a little bit over the top, but wasn't distracting.  There are TVs in the main dining room, as well as the bar.  I probably could have done without the TV in the dining room as to enjoy my dining company but maybe I'm just old-fashioned.  Service was great, friendly, and on the ball!  I will definitely be coming back here!",

    "text": "Very very pleasantly surprised!  I've driven by this place literally hundreds of times on McKnight Rd. and always thought to myself \"self, we should try that place sometime.\"  I finally did. Me and my husband went for dinner on Christmas Day and it was awesome. I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but it surpassed whatever expectation I had in my head. People were really nice who worked there, very nice inside. We got pork dumplings as an appetizer and they were really, really good. For an entree, I had the Amazing Chicken which is what I get every time I go to another Chinese place nearby and I gotta say, I was impressed. It provided worthy competition to the other place. Cheaper, too. Always nice. Recommend!",

    "text": "This is normally a good spot for Chinese cuisine and they happen to make a very good Egg Foo Yung but my visit last weekend was a tad bit frustrating. The waitress entered everything wrong. I ordered an egg roll but she brought out a spring roll. When I saw it I asked her was that their eggroll and she said yes. When I asked another waitress, she confirmed it was a springroll. Sigh. Then my waitress wanted to argue with me and I, her, she don't do that. Lol I just pointed to what I ordered on the menu. Next, our chicken wings came out....with Buffalo wing sauce on them. When I told her that's not what I ordered, she said that was all they had. I pointed to the menu again which shows they offer buffalo and regular wings and another waitress came by to offer some help. They ended up fixing it but it delayed our meal and I don't enjoy drama but I'll be back. Why?  Service like this isn't their norm and they have some great sushi and combo lo mein and not afraid to put the meat and shrimp in. The shrimp were large and cooked just right...they popped in the mouth! The food is always flavorful and fresh so they get a pass from me. Hopefully the next visit we'll be back to normal.",
