    "text": "I'm sure many agree that a downside of Pittsburgh is its distance from the coast and subsequent lack of fresh seafood, but this place is the perfect remedy when I need a quick seafood fix. It has a casual vibe and extremely reasonable prices for the selection, portion size, and quality of dishes.   It's the perfect weekend lunch destination and I've never been disappointed with my orders: the crab melt oozing with provolone and avocado and the all the salads I've had (scallops, swordfish) are crisp and showcase the fresh seafood flavor. Sushi is never my go-to, but theirs is not to miss and perfect to split if you're indecisive between the fish sandwiches or the sushi",

    "text": "We came here after visiting the Warhol Saturday afternoon, and neither of us had a clue as to what to order.   This appears to be Wholey's as  hip urban deli or coffee house. The menu's on a chalkboard, of course The staff is young, denimed, t-shirted, tattooed, pierced, no-nonsense, but jovial. You order up at the counter, seat yourself, and wait on your grub.   Guys, I'm over and done with sushi, so I didn't go there.   We began with 4 highly fresh and raw oysters on the half shell. Ironically enough, the day prior to our visit, a fellow Yelper with plans to return to Pittsburgh for good picked my brain over where to get fresh oysters in the city, and I was stumped...until now.   On a bed of shaved ice they came. The long-haired fellow who brought the bivalves to our table told us which waters they were culled from (I forget) and did so with the demeanor of an excited gamer.   \"Dude these are some SICK oysters!\"  Yeah, sick as in rare, primal, aphrodisiacal. Upon initial slurp, I was instantly envious of the apocryphal and intrepid (or just very hungry) First Man To Eat An Oyster. What was occurring in his psyche? Was he as thrilled by the mollusk's briny flavor and slimy texture as I was? Or was he just glad he didn't croak? Or did he wish he had some hot sauce to go with them?  Hell, I didn't use any condiments; I went in bareback. Yes, you read that correctly. It is the True way to appreciate and write about eating a raw oyster.   I suppose I should have been more daring and ordered a swordfish sandwich, but I felt like a crabcake, and what an outstanding crabcake sandwich this was. Between a bisected Ciabatta bun lied a gorgeous glob of abundant, ocean-fresh crab bound by the right amount of breading. The cheddar melted over the seafood spheroid completely and gracefully. The lettuce and tomato slice became immaterial. The kettle chips and deli-proper pickle shaft almost suffered the same fate. Even the perfectly fine cole slaw was almost forgotten. It was all about that crustacean-laden mass and the creamy, tangy remoulade that  magnified its flavor.   P.S. I don't know what their hours are, but I know they were getting ready to close  when we came on Saturday at 4PM. It wasn't until halfway through our meal that we realized that they had locked the doors from the inside and were turning people away. Feeling guilty, we tried to rush only to be told to relax, enjoy our meals, and be thankful that we got in under the wire. Angela and Henry were apparently just glad that PAFC got our dollars on that day in lieu of all the other options The Strip has to offer. Both of them were immensely flattered when we heaped praises upon the late lunches that were served to us without complaint. Thus was their True reward for letting us sneak in at the last minute.",

The downtown location is great for dinner!  This location is great for lunch!  So fresh and great service!   You place your order at the counter, help yourself to a drink and find a seat.  I tried the sushi, which was great!  My friend got a crab melt, which looked amazing too!  We met at 1, so missed the lunch crowd a bit, but at 1 it wasnt too crowded.   When you are there, might as well look around and pick up some fresh fish for dinner!  They have a full counter and people there to help you!  Will definitely be going back!!!!!",

I cant believe I even ate the sushi, the one roll which was a popular one that the name escapes me.  It had spicy tuna on top...it was gray in color.  I could tell by the looks as well as the taste that it was not fresh.  I asked the sushi chef about it and he said it turns that way that it was fresh.  Although I saw them mixing a new batch that was beautiful and bright in color so I know that mine was not fresh.  I left this for my husband to eat.  The shrimp tempura roll was fine.   The Fried Fish sandwich was good but nothing to rave about.  The mac and cheese was not good, it tasted like kraft.   This will not be on my list for a return trip but I am glad I gave it a shot!",

EVERYTHING was amazing, the sushi chefs were fun to talk to. Everything was so good, I literally asked a sushi chef to marry me! Definitely try the sour apple cocktail sauce with the cocktail shrimp. It's byob and they usually only do lunch, except dinner every Friday for lent, which was when we came.

As an app., we had a sushi roll that was stellar !!!  Amazing, Amazing, Awesome Sushi.  Then we got fish tacos (swordfish, salmon, and tuna, in a hard taco shell topped with cabbage, cilantro salsa) and a Happy Jack sandwich ( smoked salmon layered with cole slaw and monterey-jack cheese) Both were really good and super fresh.  I have to say that I am a huge fan of a fish taco but I prefer Mahi Mahi or Swordfish, while this fish taco was real good,.... I can say that I have had better.  The Happy Jack sandwich was real tasty, I would order that again.  We also got 1/2 dozen raw oysters and they were AWESOME !!!!  This is a super casual place for dining in.  They do have super fresh fish/seafood to buy at great prices. The Strip location is only open for lunch right now and close at 4pm.  The wait staff is real nice and the food is pretty darn good !!! They could be a bit better at cleaning the tables and floors and, when we were there there is no wait service, you order at the counter then, they bring the food to you.  All in all, I like this place and I will be back.",

I was a little skeptical about getting sushi this far away from the ocean, but her enthusiasm and familiarity with the spot put my mind at ease and I followed her lead. I am so glad I did.   The space is fun and funky -- a casual fish market and restaurant in one. It was a busy day when we were there so it took a bit to place our order at the counter and get our food, but once we did I was most definitely happy and impressed.   The rolls are unique and playful, and there's definitely something for everyone. Seating is, as I mentioned, very casual and dispersed throughout the space, which is on the louder, more cavernous side as an homage to their fish market days.   The building seemed to be under a bit of construction while I was there, so things were a bit disheveled and the restrooms were quite frightening -- filthy and  wreaking of fish. Other than that, I'd hit this place up again anytime.",

After grabbing a mung-bean pancake from our favorite vendor, my parents and I took a little turn into this place that I would supposedly LOVE.  [Full disclosure, I live by the ocean in the SF Bay--I might not be a fish-snob, but I was expecting to turn up my nose at some of the food here, just given the basic inland geography of the city.]  NOT SO!  Mom got the fish-Cuban sandwich, I had tuna sashimi and BBQ eel Don-- Dad had fish tacos and spicy tuna roll.  Not only was ALL The fish delicious, but the fried stuff on the Cuban sando was PERFECT.  Not overcooked AT ALL, in fact, as little-cooked as you would want fried fish to be.  My eel Don was fantastic down to the plain, sticky rice, and we all ended up participating int he fish tacos.  I sat, enjoying my tuna sashimi while I sat 3 feet away from a giant, dead tuna carcass over ice, gazing pensively into its open mouth as a tatted young fish-jockey hacked into its carcass with a casual, upbeat rhythm. It only made me want to eat EVEN MORE.  GO HERE, for the love of God (and beat the lunch-rush!).",

First the sushi--I know people have their loyalties, and I think I'd have to go with Andy in Wholey's. I found Penn Ave's sushi a bit small and not that memorable, or at least the rocking roll which I got anyway. The other item was the swordfish salad, for which the portion was more generous. It also tasted great, and the grilled fish was definitely very fresh. Along with other items such as appetizers and sandwiches, these are some that I will be looking forward to next time.",

It comes served to you open faced on a ciabatta roll. It's fully loaded with tuna, toasted, with melty cheddar and provolone cheese on top and a sriracha drizzle. The biggest spice factor is slices of jalapeno under the tuna. They are green and fresh so it definitely packs heat. I've had this for lunch and dinner. The sides are coleslaw and some rice which both were kind of flavorless. The prices in general are a bit high, but the service is quick and it's great for a casual bite.",

    "text": "As my loyaI readers know, I never like deducting stars from a prior rating--especially for a place that I previously rated 5 stars.  However, I feel the need to do so in this case for a major reason: False advertising.  I came by this past Sat. for lunch to try the sushi, since I'd long been wanting to do so, and I've been on a sushi kick lately.  I'd heard this place had the best sushi in PGH, and the sushi I'd seen in the photos and on others' plates had looked promising.  Before going, I looked up the prices on the website, and the price for the sashimi lunch, the platter that most interested me, was listed as $9.50.  I didn't see it listed on the chalkboard menu anywhere, but figured the price listed on the website would be accurate.  Imagine my surprise when, after eating, I went to pay and was told that it was actually $14.99.  What had actually seemed like not a bad deal for the quality and quantity of sushi I received quickly turned into quite a pricey lunch.  I would be remiss to mention that the sashimi itself was incredibly fresh and excellent in quality, so I was very pleased with it in that regard.  (My favorite component was the octopus--I loved the texture!)  I also found the quantity to be appropriate for a lunch portion--at least, for me (perhaps not so much if you're a large guy).  And, as an added plus, the presentation was pretty, and service was efficient.  So, I must agree that this is indeed the best sushi I've tried in PGH, and is 5 star quality in that regard.  If the difference between the price on the website and the actual price had been a dollar or two, I probably would have let it slide, esp. in light of the quality.  However, a 50% difference in price is substantial, esp. to someone like me who doesn't exactly have money to burn.  I'm not sure if the difference was intentional, to lure people in, or unintentional, as in the sushi page hasn't been updated in years.  In any case, though, this is a major discrepancy that needs to be corrected.  Aside from the price differential, a couple other minor things bear mentioning.  The first is that I find the order first and pay after system unintuitive and unnecessary, given that there's no real waitservice or even a bar.  The second is that the sushi menu isn't readily apparent to newcomers who approach the front counter to order.  Although I'm leaning towards a 3 star rating, I'll be generous and average my previous 5 star rating with my 3 star experience this time and award a 4.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back again at some point to try a soup or classic fish sandwich, though it'll probably be awhile.  We'll see if they can redeem themselves in the meantime.",

    "text": "[Warning: Visitor from St. Pete FL for a short trip] MARKET? RESTAURANT? DELI? YES! Okay I was mildly confused walking in--fish market (I love watching fish markets in action... even indoor ones) but further to the side it looked like a restaurant... but there were also more seating for food near the entrance? Yup--it's a bit of all three.  SUSHI AT THE DELI Upon recommendations from the staff, we settled on the Pretty Girl Roll (Salmon, Avocado, 'Spicy Sauce' with Soy Wrapper) and a Yummy Roll (Spicy California Roll rolled with Tuna, Salmon & Yellowtail). The Rolls were just okay IMO. Although this was from a Fish market there was still something about the flavor that made me wonder how fresh it was. There was nothing bad about it... just nothing that was incredible either.  SANDWICHES OR SUSHI WITH SERVICE Sandwiches and Sushi dominate the deli menu. The descriptions and styles of the Sandwiches go beyond the boring breaded and fried type... imagine Broiled Cod Parmesan or Crab Cake on top of Ciabatta Bread. I salivated looking at the Sandwiches of other diners there but we settled on the Sushi snack. You order at the counter and someone brings your dish to you. Thirsty? Just grab your bottle or can from the fridge. From your seat you also have a great view of the fish market in action.  GLUTEN-FREE/ALLERGIC TO ALL PYRA SAYS: Skip the yummy-looking Sandwiches (unless you just want to order it Breadless). At least most of the Sushi Rolls are gluten-free... aka... no Tempura chips.",

But it was a pain when we were paying.  Had to wait forever and no one pays attention even though you are standing at the register that says PAY HERE.  The concept is a little strange. You go up to the counter, pay and wait for your food. Except the food comes out whenever it is ready.  So if you are dining with someone - expect your food at different times.  The fish was very fresh and I think is a great plus.  The location was also ideal - right in the middle of the Strip District.",

The quality of the fish was just okay, and the flavors of the rolls and sushi were nothing noteworthy. I felt like I ate more rice than actual raw fish.   To be honest, this platter was too expensive for the quality and the number of items on it. I could go to an authentic Japanese sushi place and get much more for the same price.",

Remember to pay on your way out***  We tried the Pretty Girl(Lady?) roll and it was really good, and the fish was really fresh. We also each tried the Fried Cod Sandwich with the side of Cole Slaw and Jalapeno chips. The sandwich was on heavenly Ciabatta, which Penn Ave bakes themselves. The cod was fresh, and portion was generous, though not a fan of the -breading- it was inconsistent all over.   Sushi was definitely better than the cod sandwich.

It's a super casual atmosphere, and the perfect way to start a Sunday morning.  With so many breakfast and brunch options in the strip I think this place may get overlooked, which is unfortunate...so don't be fooled by the long lines at the diners down the street...some days when you don't want greasy eggs and pancakes, walk the extra block or two for a fantastic seafood twist on the best meal of the week!",

    "text": "I am particular about what I eat and I travel frequently which adds a layer of stress when it comes to eating well. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I had dinner at the Penn Fish company two nights ago. I had a lovely waitress who really went the extra mile to help describe the entrees and make sure I got what I wanted and not order too much food. She genuinely wanted me to be happy and was successful.  Next and even more important was the food itself which was outstanding. I had the triple tail special, it was perfectly prepared and delicious. The fish was  mild tasting, moist and flaky with a crisp crust. It was fresh as could be, delicately seasoned and served over seasonal vegetables that were cooked perfectly.  I did not have sushi or dessert so I can not comment on either, but I thought about my meal several times since then and wish this restaurant was in my home town.  I am sorry, but I had my meal at the other location. Otherwise this review is accurate!",

The only thing that was good was the tartar sauce. I promptly took it back. I won't be eating there again. Pittsburgh has better place for fish sandwiches.",

I have eaten several time at the Penn Ave fish company, and they are usually the best fish house in town.  But last night, our waitress was so out of it, She came back to the table three times after we ordered to confirm our order.  Each time her confirmation was wrong.  My wife's salad came after the entre was served.  And there were fake crab legs on my deluxe sushi/shashimi platter.  What goes guys?  why the collapse of service?",

I started off with the halibut and shrimp chowder ( with a clear broth) and it was the perfect  accompaniment for this chilly day.   Plenty of shrimp and halibut along with heaping spoonfuls of zucchini and other vegetables.    I than ordered the $10 sushi platter,  Platter A i believe.  It came with a California roll along with a tuna, salmon, and two other fish rolls.  It wasn't the best sushi Ive ever had but for $10 it certainly satisfied that sushi craving that we all get.    On Wednesday they have all you can eat sushi, but unfortunately they close at 4pm.",

However, recently I came for lunch on a weekend and had their Sushi Special, which was spicy salmon and avocado with (i think blackened) tuna on top.  It was phenomenal.  I could really taste each ingredient and the spice was just right.  After I ate it, I said to my friends, this is the best sushi I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  It definitely beats Tamari's attempts.  The decor in the place is very casual and is half fish market.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is quirky and feels really special in the sense that you know that it is truly a unique restaurant in Pittsburgh.  That said, the place is a necessary stop for lunch while in the Strip.",

It is a BYOB restaurant which helps keep the costs down - although their website indicates they are going to be getting a liquor license. We shared two sushi rolls - Sexy Seniorita and Pretty Girl Roll. They were both very good but the Pretty Girl seemed to be the favorite at the table. I would highly recommend the Edamame here, although you will need your drink handy as they are pretty spicy. I had the grilled shrimp entree which had charred tomatoes, roasted peppers/onions, bacon and grilled plantains. It was very good and the portion size was perfect.",

    "text": "Revising my review as I returned for lunch two days after my previous review. Food is still fantastic but I need to correct some things from my previous review. The decor is far from understated, in fact there is tacky fish/seafood/ocean decor haphazardly strewn on the walls but you don't come to a place like this for the decorations on the wall.   I had mussels for lunch, which were great, and came with ciabatta which had a hint of butter on it. Noteworthy however was the lack of a bowl to discard my empty mussel shells in. I had mussels as an appetizer at the downtown location a few days after they opened for dinner and they didn't provide a bowl for empty shells either. I asked for one and was promptly provided one but apparently this bit of intel was not promulgated far enough to warrant a change to corporate policy.   Biggest reason for my knocking a few stars off this review is the fact that the woman working the cash register and taking orders at the front spent more time on her blackberry than making eye contact with customers she was supposedly engaging with. Signing your credit card receipt? Perfect time for a few BBMs. Finalizing your sushi order? What better time than to improve on your brick breaker score. I don't expect the same level of device I get at Monterey Bay but seriously? I'd even let it slide of she was like 17, which she most definitely was not.   I'll likely go back one of the next times I'm back in town because the owners seem like good people with solid values but I'll be sure to ask for a comment card next time around.",

Taco Tuesdays - 2 for $4.99 was the highlight- combo of tuna and salmon steamed and tossed in spices along with crunchy cabbage and a creamy sirarcha/sour cream dressing is excellent.  Would recommend the soft corn tortillas over the hard shells.  Green fuji roll- on paper, it resembles one of my favorite rolls at Umi- this re-incarnation is salmon, avocado and scallions.  Unfortunately, all my salmon pieces had silverskin and thus were ridiculously tough inedible.  I gave it 30 seconds of effort and ended up poking out all the salmon so at least I could have some avocado & sushi rice.  Unfortunately I ordered takeout so I couldn't return to the sushi counter to give my opinion.  Flower roll- tuna on a spicy shrimp and avocado roll with masago on top.  This was much more satisfying, the tuna was remarkably deep ruby color, fresh and well cut with no tendinous white lines whatsoever.  8 pieces came with the order and it made up for the disastrous green fuji roll.  I would be willing to give the sushi another chance, especially since one roll was mighty tasty.  Not sure what happened with the sushi, however...",

For awhile I was off Taco Tuesday because one day we went there and we must have gotten an off day because the fish in the tacos was greasy and weirdly wet.  So we stopped going but we went again last week and the tacos were as good as ever.

I go with Boyfriend who can eat a LOT of sushi and we are always stuffed at the end.  Contrary to info on Rich Y's review this IS all you can eat, if you finish 3 rounds you can go onto another card - but if you can do that - I bow down.  Also when you get the nigiri per round it's two pieces per type of fish you select.  So if you pick salmon and yellowtail you get four pieces and then two rolls which are six pieces each (maybe fewer for some of the bigger rolls).  Be careful with timing because the special only runs from 10 until 2 so even though the lunch crowd is insane, if you go too late you might miss out.    The only downside is that since they make each plate to order and there are only two sushi chefs and a LOT of people ordering, sometimes you can wait awhile for your food.  Last time we were there I was done with my first plate and Boyfriend's hadn't even arrived yet.  But the staff is so sweet and friendly, and the sushi is so fresh, I don't care!  Ok...now is it Wednesday???",

While I would rather not rate the fish market until I buy some seafood to take home and cook myself, I will give my opinion on the lunch I enjoyed.  Darren and I split some raw oysters, as he said, and I concur with his assessment and have nothing new to add. I ordered the cod parmesan. This was something new to me. Fish, marinara sauce, cheese, and a bun. Wow! Who would have thought that this combination went together so well? Apparently someone did to create this concoction.  You have to not mind eating in a chilly fishy smelling place to enjoy your lunch, otherwise get it to go. The staff seems friendly and knowledgeable. I do hope to get back for more!!!!",

This place doesn't necessarily have all the different SPECIES of fish that the other markets do, but what it does have is impeccably fresh, beautiful fish (and molluscs, and cephalopods).  The fishmongers are incredibly knowledgeable about what they've got on the ice, and they're totally happy to answer any questions.  (Plus, if you have the fish filleted, they will not give you a strange look when you ask for the head and bones so you can make stock.)  You're buying the same fish that they're making sushi out of, so you know it's good.  My boss gets the sushi platter from here all the time, for parties and stuff.  It's delicious as well.  Not totally grandiose in its ambition and covered in weird sauces, like the overrated Nakama -- just that lovely fresh fish and rice.",

    "text": "This is the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh yet.  Of course, a month before we move back to Chicago, we find a great Pittsburgh Sushi place.   The inside is a pretty spacious, with about 15-20 tables, and a deli-style fish market area on the right that goes all the way back into the deep, narrow room.  It reminds you of Wholey's, but it's not that crowded, cramped feeling.  As you can see from the other reviews, they'll sell you a meal, or they'll just sell you fish - which is really cool.   The missus and I got two maki rolls to start: the dragon and the flower roll.  The flower was my wife's favorite (tuna, spicy shrimp, avacado, cucumber & caviar).  I liked the dragon roll because it had some crunch to it.  It's basically the california roll with some fried eel.   And just for fun, try the \"China Cola\" from the drink freezer.  It's like coke, but with a ginger-ale sort of taste to it.  Good stuff.   I think this place deserves five stars for a few big reasons:  1.) Great sushi 2.) Great atmosphere 3.) A great story: this place was started by a Robert Morris grad and her friend. It's so nice to see a place like this that could be in Seattle or San Francisco, but doing well in Pittsburgh.  Good for them.   Definitely worth a visit if you're visiting town, or a local.",

    "text": "We stopped in for lunch the day after Christmas and really enjoyed the experience.  It's a bit confusing at first, because there's a counter in the front where you order prepared food, but you don't pay when you order: you tell them what you want, they tell you to help yourself to soup and drinks, and then when you're finished you go to the register and settle up.  Not a bad system, once you understand it.  We only tried the sushi and were blown away.  We had the yummy roll (spicy California roll topped with tuna, salmon and yellowtail, $8.99 for 8 pieces) and the rocking roll (smoked eel, salmon, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, cream cheese and eel sauce, $7.99 for 5 pieces).  Both rolls kicked serious butt.  I always hate when reviews of sushi restaurants say \"the fish was fresh,\" because unless it has off flavors, I'm not sure I would really know the difference.  But this fish tasted awesome.  It was also cut beautifully and served at a nice temperature, neither warm and slimy nor too cold to taste properly.  We narrowly avoided fighting over the fifth piece of rocking roll.  A Reed's ginger ale set off the flavors nicely.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the non-sushi menu items.  They have an entire chalkboard full of different fish sandwiches, which is basically my idea of heaven.  I only wish they were open later so I could get food there on weekdays too.",

Consistency is the key at both Penn Avenue locations, I've never had a bad meal at either one!  Their sushi is always fresh and I almost never pass it up, even though their salads, sandwiches, and entrees receive rave reviews from my coworkers.  The soups are always on point, my favorite being the Boston Clam Chowder, and I usually pair a bowl with Maki Combination #4, which is a California roll and spicy tuna roll: 16 pieces of sushi for $10.50!    I've also dabbled in the crab tacos and they were quite delicious, but I always have a hard time looking anywhere but the sushi menu!   Order when you arrive, grab a seat, pay before you leave.

We saw some patrons with grey goose and cranberry which they brought in an ice chest :) love it.  The seafood is so fresh and delicious. I love that the rolls don't seem to be too heavily masked with sauces allowing the fish to really show off it's individual flavors. The texture was on point for each item.   ***Only part that wasn't so great was the gumbo. It was nothing close to what real gumbo is like. More like tomato soup with really minuscule amount of seafood. Only resemblance to gumbo was the two pieces of okra in it. There were carrots in it too. So wrong.....  Service was great. Bathrooms were clean.   FYI. My fiance told me the downtown location is much more suited for date night. This location is fun and vibrant with lots of space. Fish for sale is fresh but slightly pricey. You pay for the high quality... :)   I'd come back for the awesome sushi and oysters.",

    "text": "I generally like this place, but we had an inexcusable experience yesterday.  A group of ten of us went for $1 Happy Hour Oysters. All told, our group ordered 12 dozen, but at the end of the evening, we were charged for 16 dozen. That's nearly $50 worth of oysters we didn't eat.  The restaurant was hosting a private wedding reception on the newer half, so the place was very crowded and chaotic. Our waitress was visibly stressed out from the moment we walked in. She was visibly shaking the entire evening.   Each of us ordered our oysters at the counter separately, but she decided to maintain one \"record\" on a couple of post-it notes. It was a struggle to even get the oysters we ordered because she was very confused. As we each paid, we tipped her geneously because we could tell she was having a hard time. Yet, after each of us paid, she insisted we still owed for four dozen.   Those of us that had gotten oysters approached the counter to clear up the misunderstanding. She explained that she wrote down how many dozen we ordered as we ordered them, then crossed them off as we paid for them.  Each of us recounted how many we had ordered and how many we had paid for, and some of us provided receipts to show we had paid. This wasn't sufficient for our waitress, as she insisted she was right. It was insulting. The items she crossed off were illegible so there was no way to evidence where she had made a mistake.  We ended up having to pay for the oysters we didn't eat. She made comments like, \"We've been doing this for 10 years.\" That's swell, but your record system is archaic at best, and you are a mess right now. She complained that she didn't want \"to break the check up\" in the first place. The check shouldn't have needed broken up because we ordered separately. She should have given each person a separate post-it with their name on it. She overcomplicated the bill and then held us responsible for it. It was infuriating.  All in all, we won't be returning. Ever. It was my favorite spot for Happy Hour Oysters but I will find a new one. I've rarely been so insulted while dining out, especially by someone who refuses to accept they made a mistake when their only evidence is that they didn't scratch out something on a post-it note. We are ten honest professionals trying to have a nice night out. This was a disaster, and Penn Avenue Fish Company was responsible.",

    "text": "Decided to check out this place after reading the reviews. Place was crowded with people so it was a little hard for me to find the sushi listings. Read the chalkboard menu and at the cashier's suggestion opted for the lobster salad sandwich on a pretzel bun. I was told it comes with Cole slaw and a pasta side of your choice. My husband opted for the crab cake sandwich combo.  We were told to find a place to sit and they would bring the meal to us. When we were finished then we would go to the register for payments. It struck me odd as to why they would follow that procedure but we pulled some drinks out of the frig and decided to make sure we accounted for everything when we were done eating.  Next to the ordering counter they have an area where you can order fresh fish and sushi to go. We took a table in the adjacent room that had a \"fish\" soup bar, a salad bar, and a sushi bar. There is also a TV for convenience. The waitress shortly came out with out meals. The portions were average size and just enough. My lobster salad tasted more like the mixture than the lobster itself but my husband enjoyed his crab cake sandwich.  Our waitress stopped over to see how we were doing and I asked her about ordering the sushi. She told me that the sushi listing is inside the ordering table and not the chalkboard. She gave me a paper menu to go with the complete listing. The prices had me a bit confused so I took the matter up when I went to pay. She explained a single order of sushi consists of 3 pieces and I could build from there. So I must say my sandwich was adequate and now that I have the paper menu the next time I visit will give the sushi a try.  Dress is very casual and service was prompt. Will give it another try next time I am in the vicinity.",

The total ended up being a little over $50/person (tip included), so it is kinda pricey, but we definitely enjoyed our food, and service was great. They were also friendly with substitutions/alterations, which, as of late, is pretty rare, so that was definitely appreciated!  I can't eat seafood other than fish and I don't drink alcohol, so I can only speak for the... -Edamame appetizer (super tasty, with sesame oil + red pepper flakes) -Vegetable Risotto appetizer (very flavorful!) -Green Fuji Roll (let's face it, I love and adore anything with salmon + avocado) -Fantasy Roll (tuna + avocado goodness!) -Spicy Salmon / Yellowtail / Tuna rolls (it's spicy fish with asparagus! :] I liked the extra crunch!)  There was also a lot of love at my table for the Mango Mariachi(?) roll.   The 3 desserts we had consisted of a cheesecake, a bananas fosters-type dessert with phyllo pastry and homemade peanut butter whipped cream, and a s'mores dessert. The s'mores dessert was a little too sweet for my taste, and the cheesecake was good, but not the best I've ever had. Of the three, the bananas foster was most definitely the crowd favorite, and disappeared almost instantaneously!",

My husband & I have been going here for years and have tried most of their fish sandwiches, all of them are fantastic! We have never gotten a bad or even so so meal from this restaurant.  I have tried their sushi just a couple times & it is some of the best in Pittsburgh too. So fresh! If you have family or friends from out of town visiting & you're looking for a nice restaurant to take them too, Penn Ave Fish Company is perfect. We have taken almost everyone who comes to visit to this restaurant & they all love it too! Another plus (at least for me) is they have outside tables you can eat at with your dogs.  This place is a must try ASAP!",

The crab sliders were legit. They didn't blow my mind or anything, but they were everything I expected and then some, especially with the yummy cold slaw and the awesome pasta.  The flower girl and pretty lady rolls were spot on. They have so much to choose from, but if you are looking for two rolls these are definitely two you can't go wrong with!",

The portion of fish on each sandwich is substantial compared to others. The downside is that I ordered these medium rare and they came out medium to medium well, which dried out the fish some in my opinion.   Also ordered 3 fish tacos and I honestly didn't care for them too much. The combination of fish is what drew me toward them, but they were dry and lacked flavor.   Would definitely want to try here again if they cooked the fish as ordered. Service was also pretty slow, especially since there weren't many other people in at the time.",

Their green dragon roll was bomb and they were very generous with the portion size. Their lobster tail ramen was quite disappointing though.. soggy noodles, no flavor. Probably the worst thing on their menu, but all the other food was so excellent it definitely made up for it!

We only ordered sushi and sashimi, but I want to go back to try a fish sandwich or tacos because their menu had a great variety of fish and flavor combos. Cod, salmon, tuna, tilapia, swordfish and more.  The price is right for sushi here, especially compared to some other places I've been in the city.   I was a little surprised by the Specialty rolls. I was hoping for a selection that was a little more raw and exotic, but most rolls were pretty basic or had things I try to stay away from when ordering sushi like shrimp tempura or cream cheese.   Next time, I'll probably stick with a mix of sashimi and handrolls to get a better experience of the amazingly fresh fish they have. Can't wait to get back and try more!",

Penn Ave has an amazing staff -they are wonderful with their private parties - very attentive, friendly and accommodating -they were great about decor, cake and BYOB wine for the party.  I can honestly say that I have never had bad service here- or bad sushi for that matter. Penn Ave has some of the FRESHEST sushi in the city, if not THE freshest in the city. If you love sushi, you must come here at least once to experience it.   The only thing about Penn Ave is just that its a bit pricey, but again you are paying for the freshness and quality of the fish, so it is worth what you are paying for the food. However, their bar prices are a tad over the top for me- paying 8.00 for a Corona is a bit on the ridiculous side in my opinion. But the good news is that Penn Ave is BYOB on wine so pay a small cork fee and drink up - this is what I do every time I come here.   Favorites are their specialty Benny Roll, Dragon Roll, and Calamari appetizer with red spicy tomato sauce, olives and crusty bread. So delish!",

I also tried their sushi roll of the day. Again, very delicious and fresh. It had shrimp tempura on the inside and a grilled piece of salmon on top. Their soups are freshly made. I came at a time when their soups were almost sold out and the one they had left was the spicy seafood gumbo. It was still very delicious, flavorful, and filling. This is definitely one of my favorite spots in the Strip  Apparently they have unlimited fish tacos for $8.99 on Tuesdays. Only found out about this after I left Pittsburgh. D:",

Half looks like a fish market with tables and half looks like a restaurant. We went in the market side. The young lady at the counter explained that we could sit anywhere and that we could order there or table side. We asked for recommendations. Her name was Brenda and she was very helpful.  We took a seat and checked out the menus. There was a sushi menu, a specials menu, and a regular menu. Honestly it all sounded good. I decided to go with her recommendation.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Grey Sole with a side of  asparagus. There were two pieces of fish stuffed with crab. Yum!  But it also had a sauce that resembled a Lobster Bisque.  OMGosh!!!  I could have licked my plate. The side of asparagus had been grilled and was also very good.  My hubby ordered Mussels. These were bigger than the ones we get at the beach. Instead of a white wine, butter, and garlic sauce these had a tomato based sauce. The hubby said he liked those more than the ones he gets at the beach. That is saying a lot.  Obviously I had a Leona's ice cream sandwich for dessert. In fact I got two to take home.  This is a great place and I will def be back to try more!  FYI-it's BYOB!!!",

I tried a decked-out salmon sandwich there with avocado and an assortment of other additions, and it was a decent sandwich. Didn't blow my mind, but it was good and filling. I feel like this is one of those homey, \"Pittsburgh staples\" that is pretty fun to visit and has decent food; don't expect a Michelin star experience, of course.",

With the influx of new people, places like Penn Ave Fish Company are able to shine with their amazing food.. but with a cost.  That cost is an operation which is frankly poorly done and hopelessly confusing and inefficient. It needs to be updated.   Why do I order from one counter, get my food, sit down and eat, then pay at another counter right next to the one where I ordered at the end of the meal when there isn't any real waiter/waitress service? And you can't get your check at the table. And everyone's confused about which line is which (order vs pay). And the food can be very slow, because I think this place is taking on a few too many customers when it can't handle the demand.  Once they figure this out I'll go back. But until then they need to get their operations in check. It does not work for lunch in its current state. Too slow and too confusing.  I ordered sushi for lunch and was told it would take 45 minutes. 1 hour and 15 minutes later... no food. Me and several others from my party ended up leaving without any food.   So as much as I love the food here, which is incredible, I hope they improve their operations.",

The ciabatta bread was also fresh - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Even the cole slaw was awesome. We also had the Benny roll which was amazing.  The shrimp tempura was freshly fried and the salmon was lightly seared as I had requested. Totally rivals places in NY!",

    "text": "I'm most familiar with Penn Ave Fish Company from the downtown location so I was excited to finally visit the original location in the Strip. But this location didn't quite do it for me. I prefer the downtown location.   First of all, the Penn Ave location is not just a restaurant but it's also a store where you can buy fish. I didn't know that until walking in. So the half on the left side has the dining room tables and sushi bar. The right side has the cashier counter, some refrigerators of drinks, freezers with frozen seafood, coolers with whole fresh fish, additional tables and the kitchen in the back. So it's confusing at first when you walk in because no one is there to tell you where you can sit. Neither is there a sign. This is how I understood it to work: you can either sit down wherever you'd like and a server will come get your order or you can just order at the counter and pick a seat. You can even wander around the whole place undetected as that's what happened to us. I wish I read Angie K.'s Yelp review prior to coming here as she outlines exactly how this place works.   Anyway, the food here didn't seem consistent to the downtown location. I ordered the Unagi Don (BBQ eel bowl) and it didn't come in a bowl; it came on a plate. The downtown location use to put it in a bowl with seaweed salad and ginger which gives it some nice variety with the addition of seaweed salad. This location only gives you the rice and eel, with wasabi and ginger. My husband got fish tacos and our friend ordered the Ronnie Roll and the Shrimp and Crab Pizza. The pizza, I was told, had a nice crust.   With the sushi bar in the left half and the kitchen in the right half, there was no communication between the two and our food did not come out consistently. The warm items came out first and the sushi didn't come out until my husband and our friend already finished eating their tacos and pizza which meant I had to agonizingly watch them eat while I waited for my Unagi Don. Also, the service was slow since there were only two people working the front counter. Like I said, we went undetected for quite some time. For a Saturday night, it might be beneficial to staff more people.   I would probably order take out from here, because the food still tastes alright. The confusion and poor service just left a bad taste in my mouth.",

These oysters were fresh without tasting overly fishy, absolutely delicious.  They had two kinds, east and west coast, if I had to choose one over the other I'd go with the east coast as these seemed meatier.  We also ordered sushi for dinner, and I've had a great experience in the past with their fish quality, having bought sushi grade fish for my own making.

They may not have the best sushi rice in Pittsburgh, but if what you care about is the quality of the fish, this is good bang for your buck.  I am hooked on their Johnny Boy rolls, which I get as takeout with some regularity.  The space has a very open, modern atmosphere accented with cheesy seafood-themed decor that is sure to put a smile on your face. The staff are super friendly!  While I was waiting for my sushi one time, one of the guys behind the counter introduced himself and let me sample a fresh-shucked oyster.  They deliver through Postmates, which is a plus!  If this were situated in a city like Boston or Seattle, I'm not sure it would be worthy of 4 stars. But, for a non-seafoodie town, it's a solid choice.",

They have a hot and cold bar for take-out, which I browsed and found there to be some tempting soup options.   We sat at a high top table in the dining room and although it took our food awhile to come out, it was worth every second of the wait. My favorite was the shrimp tempura roll, which was warm to taste and I was told frying this roll this was the reason for the wait. I would have loved to try some of their sandwiches on the menu. My eyes followed every single plate that came out, making notes of what to try on my next trip here.   Some things that kept it 4 stars instead of 5: a waitress held food in one hand and sprayed a table to clean with the other, long wait for our food to come out, also I wasn't a fan of the decor (I don't think they have much of a theme), and lastly, I felt rushed while ordering, due to the ordering procedure. I wish they had the sushi on the board as well to make it a quicker ordering process, instead of looking at the taped menu on the counter. Nevertheless, the quality outweighs the quantity at Penn Ave. I hope to try out the downtown location, next.",

But the food is so wonderful I couldn't. Was also skeptical of fish in Pittsburgh but am totally comfortable eating it here!  The fish is always fresh and service is fast. The setup is overwhelming for someone like me who can't make decisions on the spot because everything looks so good, but I always resort to my go to-the crab melt. The fish tacos are also good, and the chirashi bowl is a generous portion of fresh fish. Great food for a great price! You can also watch the hip and stylish men clean and cut huge slabs of fish while you eat, cool entertainment.",

The waitress failed to tell us what we ordered only came with 2 pieces...that's 4 pieces of sushi each. Not an ideal dinner. Sushi was very good but not enough and came to $30 total for only a small amount. We had to leave and find food else where. We were very disappointed by the lack of communication and lack of menu choices.",

    "text": "Great spot for a quick lunch or if you want to pick up some fresh seafood. Since my boyfriend and I were tourists, we didn't get to do the latter but at least we got to enjoy some of the cooked food!  Their most popular sammie is the Sneaky Pete (grilled salmon on whole grain ciabatta wth arugula, avocado, hearts of palm, and spicy avocado cream sauce). They ask how well you want to cook your salmon. We asked for rare but that was really medium. I wish they had taken it off the grill sooner but even as medium, the sandwich was really good. The salmon tasted fresh.  We also had some of the crab tacos (seasoned lump crab meat in a hard taco shell topped with cabbage, cilantro salsa and sriracha). You can also opt for soft tacos if you'd like. I wasn't expecting there to be a lot of crab meat but there was a good amount. The cabbage tasted really refreshing with the tacos.  If you can't decide on one of the many food options in the Strip District, I'll make it easy for you. Skip Primanti Bros. and check out this place instead. It's cheap, fresh and delicious - three words that don't often go together.",

At first glance it did not seem like much more than a seafood market/deli.  No fancy tables or franchise decorations.  Don't let that deter you.  The food tasted Great and most importantly... Fresh.  The self serve soup was also quite yummy.    They played chill music and the ladies working at the counter were sweet and helpful.  Lastly, the prices are very affordable when compared to the nearby seafood restaurants.   If I lived in Pittsburgh,  I could see myself eating lunch here often.",

The rice was a bit overcooked, but the incredibly fresh fish and avocado more than made up for the rice. The ambiance is one of sitting in a market whilst eating sushi.

The smell is not overbearing like some other fish places and the atmosphere is completely different than what you are normally used to for a restaurant.   For both locations the sushi is Divine and you will leave feeling ridiculously full and satisfied. You can't help but smile when eating the sushi, and the random specials of the day also make you excited to see what surprise special is next!   Both locations get ridiculously busy during lunch hour so be prepared to be there for a little bit between 12-1pm.   Another recommendation is the shrimp and crab pizza. (As I was typing the food my mouth started to drool a little). It is a thin crusted pizza with a bit of a kick to it.   I can't rave enough about this place, and would recommend it to ANY sushi lover of Pittsburgh.",

They have such an excellent menu of various fish sandwiches and sushi.  Today I went there for lunch and went for the Fish Taco Tuesday special.  The fish tacos were very good - not great like other menu items.  I am a little disappointed that I did not try something new and adventerous since this was my 4th or 5th visit there.  They need to do something a little different with the setup of this place.  Not horrible but the seating could have a better lay-out and the order/payment lines are a little chaotic.  I definitely plan on going back sometime soon.  I need to try the clam chowder and/or salmon sandwich or classic engish style fish sandwich or the sushi.  Highly recommended.",

The crab was kind of underwhelmed with everything else but the cabbage was crisp and flavorful and the tomatoes had this deep red color to them and tasted really good (I usually don't like tomatoes). The srircha sauce that it advertised was actually a mixture of the sauce with sour cream. I think it went well with the tacos. I also got a bowl of clam chowder soup that was very tasty. The stock was thinner than I'm use to but still as flavorful. It was a little light on clams, though and had a lot of potato.  I'm definitely bringing my mom and dad to this place the next time they come down. They both enjoy seafood, especially the way it's prepared at Penn Avenue. They also love sushi and will probably be happy to see that predominately on their menu.",

It looked like a madhouse. One of the owners (Harry or Henry??) kept flirting with me and it made me uncomfortable because he is definitely at least 45 and I'm 18 lol. It didn't help that I kept catching him looking at me while I was eating..  When I first went to Penn Ave Fish Co, I immediately thought, \"This place is a shit show.\" There was a blatant disorganization between the kitchen and the front of the house. In fact, there was even miscommunication amongst the servers themselves.   When I received some of my food (they forgot the sushi), my server had went to go retrieve one of the other servers because she \"didn't know which one it was.\" It just seemed like the servers were relatively clueless and would only say what they thought you wanted to hear in this awful whiny baby voice. And does anyone think it's weird that all the servers are girls? I guess if making your servers show their  bare chests brings you business then so be it. The Hooters of Fish joints, let me tell you.   The service was terribly slow but at least the food was kind of good. I got the Sanjaya Swordfish which was a little dry and bland but the sushi made up for it. I got a sexy senorita roll which I highly recommend. The yellowtail tasted fresh. I also had a side of pasta salad and it was too vinegary. Hardly finished the first bite.   I had the chance to talk to one of the owners (Harry or Henry??) and he honestly made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. He came over to my table of three and it just felt like he was hovering over me too closely. At first, I thought it was just me and then my two brothers said it felt like he kept checking me out even after he left left the table. What a creep job! He even winked at me too when I left.   Maybe I'll get take-out sometime but definitely not dining in ever again.",

The price listed on the recipe did not match the prices on the menu board.  When I questioned it, the cashier informed me that their price went up yesterday, but they haven't had time to update their signage yet.  My suggestion that I be charged the advertised price was met with a shoulder shug and her continuing to take the next order.

I don't know why as the decor makes no sense lol, but I guess it makes me think/feel like I'm at one of my favorite fish shops back in Florida. I ordered the English-style cod sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the yellowfin tuna teriyaki sandwich. I must say, they gave him a mighty nice looking piece of tuna. He ordered it rare and said they cooked it pretty well.  My cod was also super tasty.  The fish was nice and light and flaky, though I could have done with a heavier batter. And alas, no fries. Just a side of pasta and slaw, neither of which were to my liking. I also was not a fan of cod on the ciabatta. It's the bread they serve all of their sandwiches on, but I felt like it conflicted taste-wise too much with my cod.  We did not try any sushi, but seeing as everyone says it's one of the best in town we'll probably be back to give it a shot. The locations are so convenient and overall it was not bad eats.",

Maybe she is not a paid employee & just a college student with nothing to do on a Thursday evening.  Still not who I want bringing my food. I asked the girl at the counter for a recommendation, since this was my first time here.  She said, \"We're known for our fish tacos...\"  Ummmm....I have no idea WHY!!  They had zero flavor and were absolutely nothing to write home about.  Kaya's fish tacos blow those out of the water (slight pun there).  My boyfriend had the swordfish salad - also something not worth even discussing.   I saw all the great reviews....and I feel like I wasn't even at the same place.  Odd, but True story.   My boyfriend, the nice guy he is, left a tip...what for!!!??? I took it and bought a real taco at El Burro on my way home.   I love fish and usually get my fix at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille (just one block down from this place)...that's where I'll continue going.",

    "text": "Decent sushi is so hard to come by in Pittsburgh.  I guess that's what makes Penn Ave Fish Company just that much better!  Before we ordered, we headed to the back of the restaurant to check out their fresh fish for sale.  They had a good assortment of fresh fishes, and shellfish as well as the most beautiful scallops I've seen in a while (but ran around $23 a pound... =/)  I ended up ordering sashimi lunch platter and a scallop pizza to split.  The sashimi platter came with three pieces of salmon, four pieces of tuna, five pieces of fluke, three pieces of octopus and two pieces of crab.  The fish was some of the freshest fish I've had in Pittsburgh.  The crab was forgettable, but all the other pieces were absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Originally I was going to just get the sashimi platter and my companion was going to just have a maki combination, but we saw that lots of people were eating the scallop pizza so we decided to get one too!  The pizza was like a \"white pizza\" and came topped with sliced scallops, cheese, tomatoes as well as some rosemary.  The scallops were super tasty and brought an otherwise mediocre pizza to a whole new level.  I really like how the staff is really cheerful as well as the incredible prices!  My sashimi platter with 15 pieces of sashimi (and two pieces of crab) was just under $10, my friend's maki combination was under $7, and the scallop pizza was also just under $10.  It was definitely more than enough to fill me up.",

    "text": "I have no idea how this place hasn't been reviewed on here yet. It's very \"yelp\"....feeling like it was plucked off a street in Seattle or San Francisco.   The front consists of a large amount of glass so the natural sunlight and slick track lighting light up the big open warehouse style space. Lots of aluminum accents and polished concrete give this a very clean, modern feel. On the right of you are the different counters where you order sushi, sandwiches or  fresh fish from the market. There is also a counter that you pay at after you eat (it's all on the honor system). The music is at a good volume on a great sound system with some good bass. Very chill deep house and loungey drum and bass fill the room. A nice sophisticated touch.  In the middle is a narrow strip of tables running about half the length of the building. This place gets CROWDED during the lunch hours so make sure you come early, late, or don't mind battling for space to eat.   Now onto the food. This is the freshest sushi I've had in Pittsburgh so far (haven't made it to Umi yet), and still up there with stuff you'd find in a coastal city. Makes sense, because you can literally see them cleaning and prepping all of their fish at the next counter down . Everything literally melts in your mouth. Nothing is dry, chewy or fishy, even with salmon. It's great. They also get a little creative with their sushi dishes, usually having something different each day. My personal favorite is the Spicy Senorita Roll, with Yellowtail, Jalapenos and Cilantro. Awesome! Make sure you check out the combos and larger plates they have if you have more than one person.  I haven't honestly tried anything else other than the fresh soups (they usually have about 4 daily, and they're all incredible). The sandwiches look great though, so I can't wait to try them. The crabcakes are gigantic - those are first on my list.  So if you're like me and have been looking for a fast-casual style sushi counter/fish market in Pittsburgh, this is your place. The only improvement I could see here would be more seating....maybe a rooftop deck would be a good idea.",

Sounds like a good deal, right? Think again. These rolls were MINUSCULE and still even only had six pieces instead of eight. The rice was not even on the outside. What kind of half-assed place doesn't even bother with the little extra effort to do that?  Meanwhile, the whole restaurant/shop smelled extremely fishy (think fish tank that hasn't been cleaned in 3 years) and I personally saw flies landing on the fish that a guy was cutting up when he would walk away to grab something. Uhhhh... nasty!   They've also discontinued the all-you-can-eat sushi Wednesdays citing the Tokyo Nuclear incident as the reason. Really? But buying rolls piecewise is okay? Shouldn't the shop shut down if they are so concerned?  And finally, I am not sure if this next point is a positive or a negative for readers, but I will mention it in case anyone finds it informative: the cashier/waitresses all have these low-cut tops where their anatomy is nearly falling out. Personally I prefer to eat at restaurants that don't have to rely on the harlot card to gain business, but that's just me.",

I have to say the oysters at Penn Ave Fish Co. are amazing! They are fresh and full of flavor. It was easy to distinguish between the different types of oysters (there were 5 different kinds). I thought they could have cleaned/shucked them a little better, but overall I was delighted by the quality.  That being said, my sushi menu experience was mediocre. I tried the unagi don, pretty girl roll, and tuna/salmon sashimi. The unagi itself was overcooked, and the sauce was a bit too thick and the flavor wasn't quite there. The rice was dry and over-seasoned. The whole dish was topped with slices of avocado, which was unexpected. The pretty girl roll was a little bland, but the fish to rice ratio was excellent, and I enjoyed it overall. I loved the tuna sashimi but the salmon didn't taste as fresh.  I would return to this place to try more of their non-sushi dishes, or more of their sashimi. Their sushi menu seems Americanized, and I prefer Japanese sushi.",

It's a weigh and pay method and it was a bit confusing to find the scale and the employees just leave you to it...we never did find the printer so we wrote the weights on a napkin! There were 2 soup options: one was cream based with crab and one had salmon with tomato base. I tried both and they were both so flavorful and rich. The salad bar was small and I don't remember anything remarkable about it. We also ordered salmon sushi and it was perfect.  On my second visit I went with the smoked salmon benedict. The poached egg was perfectly cooked with a soft and velvety yolk. I relished every bite. The tasty home fries side was cheesy and thus was very heavy and greasy. I could have done without the mayonnaise cole slaw it came with. I would prefer a green salad to complement the heavy potatoes and rich eggs.  The atmosphere is fish market meets deli. There are tables in the market area and also near the buffet in an adjoining room. With metal chairs on a hard floor it can get loud in there.   I still crave that salmon benedict and I will be back!",

Their sushi is probably the best - hands down, in the city and surrounding Pittsburgh neighborhoods.   Not only buying fresh fish here but also the restaurant and the daily soup bar is always a bonus. Food comes out quick, presentation is always on point, the menu is extensive and will cover everybody's palate. They do have their liquor license so you could grab a beer. But that menu is limited. I would still BYOB for your favorite.   Ask about having a sushi rolling party for your business or get a group of friends together. A great way to spend time with one another and have a great Epicurean experience!!  They have expanded the restaurant and also have a parking lot, so if you're coming down for lunch, most likely try to grab a spot in the lot, if not there is street parking.",

    "text": "Being in Pittsburgh you might assume that our seafood game is weak, but Penn Ave is a nice surprise to prove you wrong! I've eaten here several times (both dine-in and take-out), and it's a go-to if I'm craving some fresh sushi, crab, swordfish, tuna, salmon, you name it.  The dilemma of whether to order sushi or one of the seafood items from the menu is a serious problem for me. Problems like these are my favorite, because no matter what I'll be happy. It's a given when I order sushi that one of the rolls I get will be a Philly roll, but you can't go wrong ordering anything else from Penn Ave's menu. The sushi is rolled fresh in the back dining area of the restaurant, and they feature a special roll on the menu board at the front counter where you walk in.  Just recently I was here for lunch with my mom and my boyfriend, and we all ordered different sandwiches. I got the crab melt and crossed my fingers that it was going to make me happier than sushi would have that day. Thankfully after I took a bite I was relieved that I made the right choice, and my lunch guests were happy with their choices, too. The only complaint would be that after being offered soup from the soup and salad bar we were not made aware that it was an additional charge. The seafood gumbo I had was great, but not necessarily something I would've opted for knowing that it was going to be an extra $3.99. Overall I'd put Penn Ave in my list of favorite lunch spots, so if you are a seafood fan I'm sure you'll feel the same!",

The spicy tuna was odd and subpar, the salmon sushi was a weird cut, chewy, and room temperature, and all the special rolls we ordered just tasted like a bunch of cilantro. Also I mean I get it because it's a fish company but the whole place smells really bad. And they started taking out the garbage and rolling it by us when we were eating. All in all a truly odd and terrible experience",

With the freshest fish in the city and the best sushi and the city, it's sure to be a place you'll find yourself back at again and again once you start.  If you are the type that mingles with the staff, they'll let you know when they'll get the next 170lb yellowfin tuna in! Perfect for taking home and making your own sushi with.   But if you aren't feeling so creative, you can check out their selection of sushi. I don't know if I can recommend a specific roll because they are all so good. But, if you are into hot things, try out one of their (I think it's called ) Dragon rolls - topped with one of my favs, Sriracha sauce.  Not one for the raw stuff? That's fine. Try out the scallop pizza, or fish tacos. Both make me weak in the knees. Perhaps you are picky about your fish? That's fine, go on to the back and pick out the cut you want. They'll grill up anything they have for you, right there.   Staff is totally knowledgable and friendly. I go twice a month and they always remember me. If you pick their brain about the fish you can get some pointers on how to cut it, how to prepare it, all kinds of stuff. Oh, and this place totally works on the honor system. You tell them what you ordered when you leave. For some it is confusing, but I find it nice to order and not worry about the check until I am ready. Great for lunch.   I am telling you... you MUST check this place out. Don't bother with Wholey's, especially if you are looking for sushi meat!",

And the service is very good, there's just not a whole lot of it, since you order at a counter, pay at a register, and get your own drinks from a cooler. I tyically get sushi, but I've also had the best fried-fish sandwich of my life at this place.",

The amount of crab in the sandwich was on the skimpy side, but the taste was on point. You can tell all of the ingredients they use are super fresh!  Service was just okay. It seems as though this place gets really hectic around lunchtime...crowded around the front where you order and loud.",

After about ten minutes a friendly waitress told us she would be taking or order. She came back after about ten minutes and took or order. The food took very long to come (as did the check) and we were all non-plussed by it considering that it was quite expensive.  The atmosphere is very unwelcoming. It smells pretty bad of fish, the interior design is very sterile, and the music is way too loud and is not the kind of music you want to rock out to when you are spending 20 bucks for a sandwich with chips, a bowl of soup, and water.   The product seems okay, but they need to do some work on the overall \"feel\" of dining here. It would take a lot of convincing for me to come back here. I would definitely not recommend this place at this time.",

    "text": "I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and her parents for lunch.  The outside of this place fits into the neighborhood and looks like nothing special.  However, once you step inside though you soon realize that you are a pretty awesome place.  It is a full-fledged fish market complete with a good amount of whole fish as well as a deli type area and even a fish cleaning station where you can actually watch the workers clean fish at.  Most of the workers are also dressed the part with rubber coveralls that you would expect to see on a fishing boat out in the ocean.  The bathroom to the restaurant is in the back and you have to walk through the kitchen in order to get there which I found to be pretty cool.  The whole place is also decorated with fishing related items even including the bathroom which had at a fly rod inside of a case stuffed to the side of the wall.   The restaurant portion of this place is a confusing whenever you first walk though the door as there are seats strewn about everywhere with a chalkboard menu behind the cashier.  However, after asking a question to the girl behind the counter I was told that I could order at the counter and pick a seat of my choosing and pay at the end.  Since I had heard good things about the sushi here I decided to start off my meal with the Boston Roll and also went with the Broiled Cod Parmesan for my lunch entree.  It was only after I had ordered and sat down that I noticed a large soup station and became jealous that I did not order some.  My girlfriends parents ended up getting some, a chowder of sorts, and said that it was really good.  After waiting only a short time at the table my Boston Roll was served to me.  It was sliced into eight pieces and had the shrimp, avocado and cucumber on it as promised by the menu.  It tasted excellent and I felt like it was quite a refreshing dish and that it was a good starter for my meal.  Soon thereafter my fish sandwich came out with sides of both slaw and some type of deli salad that had chick peas in it.  I first took a bite of the cod removed from the sandwich in order to get its full flavor and found it to be pretty amazing.  The breadcrumbs gave it a rich crunchy buttery flavoring with the mild flavor of the fish coming through slightly.  After my first bite I was excited to try it on the sandwich as cheese and pasta sauce normally only make things better and whole doesn't love a good Ciabbata?  The bread was good but sadly I was disappointed that the sauce and cheese completely covered the delicate flavoring that I had enjoyed when tasting the fish alone.  Although I still enjoyed the rest of my sandwich I felt like it had the potential to be better.  The deli salad that came with it was also good and while I personally did not enjoy the slaw (slaw always seems to be such a personal taste) my girlfriend really did.  Overall though I really enjoyed my meal and loved the ambiance of this place.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading back here in the future.  As a matter of a fact just thinking about having some sushi along with a one of those good smelling soups is making my mouth water.",

Since it was lunch, I stuck with a P.A.F.C. salad topped with salmon, and, because I just couldn't resist it--a cup of Boston clam chowder.    DELICIOUS, and so cool--they have all kinds of nautical art on the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  The menu is written/decorated on a chalk board, and you pay at the register when you're done eating.  I can't wait to go back and try everything.  I'm looking forward to sushi here...but seriously, I will try everything. Muahaha.",

The lobster roll was the best one I've ever eaten (pretzel bun FTW) and the sushi was also phenomenal. You can also buy fresh fish here so we got some Scottish Salmon to go!

Street parking was easy on a Saturday night. When we arrived we realized there was a parking lot right next to it too.   This is the kind of place I like. It's got great food, but it's not pretentious, and it's casual dining. Prices were mid-to-high, but definitely worth it.   We had the Rosemary Scallop Pizza, Larry David, and the Squid Fries.  Fries: 7/10. They were decent. Not too much of anything, the sauces were as expected. The roasted red pepper sauce was better than expected.   Larry David: 9/10. It was a decent sandwich, but the BREAD took it above and beyond.   Rosemary Scallop Pizza: 10/10. The crust was buttery. It was golden all the way through, with minimal charring. It supported all the toppings, no problem, while staying thin. Cheese was great. Scallops were wonderfully blistered and buttery. Rosemary leaves added the roasted complexity I didn't even know it needed. You should have heard me as I was eating this.",

Looks like this place is a vendor for restaurants but also carries a killer food dine-in menu.  I ordered the crab cake sandwich on ciabatta. This may have been one of if not the best crab cake I've ever had. The meat was flaky yet put together and the flavors were booming. It was seared to perfection and left a lingering taste in my mouth in which I think about often. My boyfriend ordered a fish sandwich and it was melt in your mouth good. It was very simple, however it didn't need to be anything beyond that.  I wish I found this place day one instead of last day because I would have stopped in again for lunch. What a wonderful experience!!",

    "text": "Mixed review!  Dinner: I stopped here on a Friday evening for sushi, and to enjoy sitting outside. Luckily, I called ahead and the hostess told me that this restaurant is BYOB. Important stuff! The service and time for sushi was lacking. The sushi itself for dinners was very fresh, and good! I was also surprised by the amount of fish on the hand rolls.   12 hours passes, I'm in the strip on a hot day with my dog... might as well stop again. Surprise! No one serves you outside for lunch. I sat there for a few minutes and eventually called the restaurant to ask someone to bring me water and a menu (since I had my dog) All the items from dinner menu are not on the lunch menu(limited) so I was stuck getting sushi again. I don't eat much meat so I was kind of fished  out, when the \"waitress\" told me there was a vegetarian roll I was excited... then quickly disappointed. Total yuck. Absolute no flavor, no toppings, nothing. I know what you're thinking \"that's what you get for getting a vegetarian roll\" no! There are plenty of other sushi restaurants that have had amazing vegetarian rolls, and I have to say I wasn't the least bit impressed with this one.   Summary: dinner experience was lovely, lunch was not. I was a fan of the fresh fish, but service wise I would say there is some work that needs done there.",

It wasn't until recently, when I was at an event they catered, that I realized just how good their quality of fish was and how skilled their sushi staff were in preparing it.  First off, things are a little different here - you go up to the register and place your order - then, the wait staff brings it to you. You get up and pay at the register after your meal - it's sort of a hybrid between a \"fast food\" style ordering situation and a sit-down restaurant. Nothing too off, just different from the norm.  Anyhow, the fish is suuuuper fresh, and you can really tell that the quality is far above most regular sushi joints. You never really wait too long, either - even when this place is packed, I have had great luck in getting our order quickly. While the ambience isn't your typical Japanese izakaya -style setting, it is really fun to enjoy delicious sushi here and listen to the classic rock that the staff likes to play. I never knew that Led Zeppelin and Boston would pair so well with my Unagi roll! Enjoy!",

The salmon was perfect, especially coupled with the freshness of the arugula and the spicy creamy avocado sauce - not too spicy but not too bland.

I highly recommend the she-crab soup. I could've had 10 bowls of this stuff! 5/5  For my main meal I tried the spicy tuna melt. So good and so fresh. There was a generous amount of tuna included and it was just the amount level of rich and fillings. Delicious and 4/5  Will definitely be back to try some of their famous sushi.",

I truly think they have some of the freshest fish in the city.  This is honestly my go-to stop when in the strip (or close by, let's be honest). My main orders are the charashi bowl, spicy yellowtail and/or pretty girl roll. I don't stray too often. I know, creature of habit! They do have a rather large menu of sandwiches, salads and fish entrees. They also have a daily sushi special if you want to mix things up. I look at it as chef's choice. It's also BYOB and open for dinner, if you're looking for a casual night spot.   Just some tips. You order at the far left side of the counter, but pay after you have eaten. You can also grab whatever beverage you like from the two refrigerators.",

    "text": "Penn Avenue Fish Company: Hook, Line, and Sinker   When you think of Pittsburgh cuisine, you might not think of sushi and fresh fish.  Sure, we've got three rivers, but the Mon isn't exactly the source of sushi grade tuna.  And we're not living the Japanese life where you can munch on sushi from a vending machine...hmmm.  So where can you go to quiet your craving for aquatic-dwellers?  The Penn Avenue Fish Company has your back...or your stomach.    The PAFC has two locations (the Strip District and Downtown).  We've been to both locations, but we're always drawn back to the Strip location.  Not only is the Penn Ave location where it all began, but the amount of stimuli in this place is unreal.  Not only is it packed with patrons getting their eat on (it's always jammed at lunch), but the guys and gals who run this eatery are really working!   If you look to the left, you'll see the fishmongers filleting up whole fish and wrapping up various fresh orders for the at-home cooks.  In the center, is the sushi counter.  Here you can sit and watch the sushi masters create art on a plate.  Some of those rolls are almost too picturesque to eat...almost.  At the front counter, people are jockeying for their turn to check out the chalkboard menu and place their orders.  (Don't be surprised if Angela Earley, co-owner alongside Henry B. Dewey, writes your ticket herself.) This is also where you pay when you're done eating.  Besides sushi, the regular menu ranges from sandwiches and tacos to pizzas and salads.  They also have daily soups and specials.  While you might have trouble deciding what you want, trust me when I tell you that everything is fresh and delicious.  No matter what you pick, your mouth will be happy. One of my favorite sandwiches to order is ...

Clamoring for some food to shove into my hungry belly, I was mighty happy to spy a creative menu laden with sushi and fish delectables. After we claimed a table, we sauntered up to the counter to order the following: Flower roll, Pretty Girl roll, Spicy Senorita roll and seaweed salad.   As we waited for our influx of sushi we imbibed upon the delicious yet spicy bottled capsacin citrus beverages found in the cooler. If you're looking for a kick in the throat - get yourself a bottle. Back to the sushi - super delightful! My favorite was definitely the Pretty Girl roll, and this says a lot considering I'm typically not a salmon fan. The soy paper wrapped beautifully around the large, fresh hunks of salmon and avocado.   Also worth noting that the Spicy Senorita was a refreshing option added into the mix. Eating a tasty roll such as this makes me a little sad when I think of the tiny population of people who taste soap when they eat cilantro...they'll never know the goodness of a roll like the Spicy Senorita. Oh well, I guess I'll just eat their share.",

    "text": "I was FINALLY able to visit this place for their all-you-can-eat sushi wednesdays.  In addition to other specials like Taco Tuesdays, they offer this special on wednesdays from 11AM-2PM (this window of time, the cashier says, is created so that the sushi chefs have time to prepare and time to clean up and leave).  Taco tuesdays, however, are all day long, 9-4.  This review is for their sushi wednesdays only.  I'm fully convinced that this is probably my go-to place for sushi in pittsburgh before 4PM.  It's quite unfortunate that I can't enjoy their food for dinner.  My friend and I went around noon.  The cashier gave us each a form to fill out, indicating the rolls and nigiri that were available for the sushi wednesday special.  this menu is available on their website. as it also state on the website, one must be wary of their classification of AYCE. You are actually limited to 3 rounds.  First round: 2 nigiri (4 pieces total) and 2 rolls (11-12 pieces total).  First round must be finished before second round. Second round is the same, and third round is 2 nigiri and 1 roll.  This was definitely one of the fresher sushi fish I have tasted in Pittsburgh.  The salmon was average to good, and the yellowtail was awesomely tender.  one major, and i mean MAJOR, downfall of the meal overall was how tightly they packed the rice for the nigiri.  It was definitely bottom-of-the-ricepot rice, which accounted for its temperature, but the sushi chef put a death grip on this thing.  When i picked it up, the whole surface of the sashimi was glued onto the rice. when i bit into the rice, it felt like I was biting into packed refrigerated rice (which, if you don't know, is VERY hard).  It was excessively dense, and sort of destroyed the nigiri for me.  I tried to eat some of the rice to \"finish\" my plate, but I ended up leaving some of it under an expertly placed used napkin on the place.  Despite the nigiri, which was probably isolated to the work of one of the two working sushi chefs, the rolls were wrapped looser than most places, which I didn't mind at all.  I got through two rounds (they had accidentally given me round 1 and 3 first, before round 2), but by my last round, I could only finish 1/3 of my plate.  I took the fish out from my rolls, and off the rice, and I just ate the fish before leaving.  At 18 dollars (19.25 with tax, i believe), for all this sushi, this is a serious steal for pittsburgh sushi.  I can't wait to go back here again for sushi and to try their fish sandwiches, another one of my favorite foods.  5 stars for beating out the pittsburgh sushi places I have tried (Yokoso, Sushi Kim, Chaya, Taipei Inn (good for just rolls but pricey)) in the best balance of quantity and quality.  do see the pictures i uploaded of my round 1 and round 3 (with some fish leftover from round 2)",

This rivals Vegas New York and San Francisco. Everything is made fresh. The soups are phenomenal and they always have a good selection. The sushi is absolutely amazing. And you can't mess with just their good old-fashioned fish sandwich. They recently expanded the restaurant so there's plenty of seating now. They also have a sushi bar we can sit out. The only downside is it is BYOB. All in all one of the best places to get seafood in Pittsburgh.",

You order at the counter and they bring the food to you - great for a quick, but delicious lunch.  Everything is very fresh, to the point where you can see them carving GIANT fish on the counter and shipments of new fish constantly rolling in!  (I think a server said they get shipments at least 3x a day.)  I honestly wanted everything on the menu, but went with a bowl of swordfish bisque and crab cake sliders (served on a pretzel roll - sold!!)  Both were delicious and I can't wait to go back!  Someone next to us was eating sushi and I will probably have to try that ASAP.  The staff was all very friendly and service was quick also.  Prices reasonable for the high quality fish served.

    "text": "An interesting combination of a seafood market and a seafood restaurant. I didn't buy anything from the market side, but the fish looked great. It seemed fresh, and the display was aesthetically appealing.   As for food, I ordered the Sanjaya Swordfish sandwich. I don't think the ingredients came together well as a sandwich. The swordfish was good even though it was completely cooked through. (Normally, I don't like my fish to be completely cooked through). The curry sour cream sauce was good too and would have made a nice compliment to the swordfish on its own. I don't think adding the grilled red onion, cilantro, and ciabatta was necessary. The latter three were good too individually too: the onion had a nice char, the cilantro was fresh, and the ciabatta was warm and soft. Unfortunately, I felt the latter three overwhelmed the swordfish, in turn, making it difficult to appreciate the fish.  Also, I liked the macaroni shell and pepper salad which came as a side with the sandwich.  I would definitely return to Penn Ave Fish but not for a sandwich. I'd probably try the fish tacos, try something from the sushi bar, or order some fish from the market side to take home.  Lastly, the ambiance is worth mentioning. Penn Ave Fish feels like a last-minute effort to sell anything fish related out of a garage...which is likely their intention. You can see the entirety of the kitchen, and patrons have to walk through the kitchen on their way to the restroom. The playlist is dark and included experimental artists such as Gorillaz. The whole experience is very raw.",

Barely any filler, fresh avocado, and spicy remoulade make this a stellar sandwich. They typically service sandwiches with a side of coleslaw or pasta salad. I don't typically enjoy coleslaw, but I enjoy theirs! If you are a fan of sushi, I recommend the Spicy Senorita Roll. The jalapeno really gives it a kick which accompanies nicely with the cool taste that sushi provides. Anything you order on this menu - you cannot go wrong. The atmosphere is equally as awesome as the food, as it is a True fish market. The bright colors and good music make it a great place to stop and enjoy lunch.",

    "text": "It's hard to miss this fish market/eatery, right in the middle of the strip. It's not often that you come across an indoor fish market selling the most exquisite varieties of fish and other seafood, and also housing a cool and casual looking restaurant with an interesting seafood inspired menu. I was really looking forward to eating here, but the experience was far from anything I was hoping for. Sitting in the midst of a fresh fish market, I had high expectations about the quality of seafood I would be served. The high yelp ratings only fueled my expectations further. I ordered a lobster roll sandwich on a pretzel bun, and my husband went with the Smoked salmon Benedict. Maybe, I just ordered the wrong thing...I now see that most yelpers have not enjoyed their lobster sandwiches a lot, wish I had read the reviews earlier. Well, to their credit, the food did come out pretty fast. The smoked salmon benedict looked nice and my husband seemed to enjoy it. But the lobster sandwich was quite a disgrace. Did I mention that I love lobsters? I found it hard to believe that someone could go wrong with lobster rolls/sandwiches. All you need is some good lobster meat and bread, maybe a dollop of butter as an added bonus. The lobster meat itself wasn't probably bad in this sandwich, but you could hardly taste it because it was mixed with other things. And if you want to serve a lobster-slaw kind of filling instead of pure lobster meat, you should probably add some spices and seasoning to it, at least some salt for starters. The dry, over-toasted pretzel bun with no butter/cheese/mayo/mustard did not help either. The side of fresh fruit was probably the only redeeming feature of this meal. Such a letdown! Please do not go for the lobster roll here, even if you love lobsters as much as I do. I'm sure the other things on their menu are much better..I myself would like to try their sushis based on all the great reviews.",

The seafood here is really fresh and they certainly know how to season and cook just to perfection. Even with the large space, practically  all seating was taken. It's very busy inside with lots of movement and noise. There is a slightly claustophobic feeling in the first main dining area as it's really close to the entrance and regsiter. But, keep in mind, it is a large location with different eating areas. You may have to wait a little to be seated but you also have the option of sitting right outside. On the other hand, service at register was a little frosty but keep in mind, it's very busy and I do think they try to get things moving as fast as possible. Ciara who was our \"server/waitress\" was super friendly and an absolute delight to talk to.They have a great selection of organic/natural drinks. We ordered a selection of sushi and the salmon salad. Perfect portions and presentation was really appealing. All around freshness. Wait wasn't long. We are definitely coming back here. Side note. Dress code is casual, or whatever you feel best in and they have a \"honor and pay\" system. Which I thought was pretty quirky and cool. Great place. Definite thumbs up.",

You can either order at the counter like during lunch or you can request to be served at a table. We ordered a bunch of sushi to share - green dragon, benny and sexy senorita. The rolls were awesome! Service has always been friendly and prompt - they accommodated our request to have the cilantro on the side for the sexy senorita. BYOB and allowed us to keep our beers in the fridge. Once you're done you pay at the counter just like at lunch time. The nice thing about coming here for dinner is that the Strip isn't as crazy as during the day so street parking is easier.

    "text": "I want to give Penn Avenue Fish Company 5 stars and before Saturday night I would have... We have been there a number of times for the Oyster Happy Hours during the week and loved it. Emphasis on the lov-ed, as in past tense.  Saturday we went with a  large group and things seemed very off.  They were prepping for a  private party in the newer section of the restaurant so seating was limited.  The staff pulled together tables for us and although the service was slow we didn't complain.  It was a great time.  I mean who wouldn't be happy eating fresh oysters and other seafood while hanging out with some of your favorite people on earth.  All the joy ended when it was time to pay the bill.  The system to order and pay did not serve us well.  Even though each of us ordered separately and received our orders individually at the end of the night the waitress said we still owed them for 48 oysters.  It is hard to miss eating 4 dozen oysters and no we did not order them.  The only thing I can imagine is that someone else ordered 4 dozen oysters and it ended up on our bill.    It was an insult to say we lied about what we ordered and ate. I am still in shock over the entire episode.  I have never encountered anything like this in my years 50 years and I eat out a lot.  It is unfortunate as I could have seen myself and my friends going here weekly but it is hard to swallow what happened and there really isn't any way to ensure that it won't happen again..    My advice is steer clear if they are extremely busy and keep your oyster shells until you pay to prove how many you ate or you might end up in the same boat as us dishing out cash for food that you didn't order or receive.    My recommendation to Penn Ave Fish Company is close early or post something on your website if you close down half the restaurant we could have found another place to dine and you would still have high standing in our book. A lot of reviews talk about the confusion caused by the system to order and pay... it is a shame that cannot be fixed.  .",

The service was fine and our waitress was pretty good at keeping up with us.  The bad: The portions were rather lackluster. The sides that came with the main course were tiny and the halibut was good but not satisfying. I could have had another piece. Also, when I made the reservation I asked if the lunch menu would still be available during dinner service and was told it would be (our reservation was for 6 PM). But when I asked for lunch options our waitress said that they were out except for the tacos and another item. She told us this happens often. I wish they would have told me this when making the reservation a week prior. They were even out of the soups and bisque, which was disappointing.   Overall I would try this place again, but more likely to shoot for lunch. For $30+ for a dinner I kind of expect to be satisfied and not wanting more. I stop eating a meal after feeling somewhat full and I was nowhere near that after the fish tacos and halibut, so my friends and I decided to walk to Primanti's and have a sandwich, we were still that hungry.",

Why does everything around this city look like you went to a garage sale to provide the furnishings?  The fish was ok. The atmosphere? Generic and nothing special.

The men working there look like they just walked off a boat from an episode of the deadliest catch. Fresh fish is everywhere you look being packed on ice and sliced for consumption. The smell fills the air and adds to the already amazing experience.   The specials are a must. If they have it as a special, chances are it is delicious. I almost always get whatever the special is. Sometimes it's a sandwich, sometimes it's a pizza but all of the time it's absolutely delicious!   Next comes the sushi!!! You will not go wrong ordering sushi here. I have eaten sushi all over pittsburgh and let me just tell you this is some of the best. The rolls are fatter, tastier and just all around better than anywhere else!   Sunday is all you can eat fish taco bar. Always have great specials. Staff is also very attractive. Hello ladies! What more can you say!? A+",

Between my husband and I, we ordered the seafood bisque soup, crab tacos, clams, and a salmon \"energy\" plate. Every item was amazing.   When it was time to pay for our order we only ended up spending $36. I could not believe we paid so little for quality seafood. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would definitely visit often. What a gem!",

As a seafood lover, I was careful not to hold my expectations too high for land-locked Pitt. Turns out, I had nothing to worry about. I think I shed a little tear. It could have been the hunger, too.  The sushi is fresh. The special of the day gave us a good variety of high-end pieces of fish--score! The ingredients swordfish tacos and crab tacos, from the meat to toppings were also amazingly fresh (I consider myself a bit of a fish taco connoisseur, thank you very much), with the hard shell winning over the soft shell. The tacos also came with this homemade chipotle sour cream, a perfect complement!  At the end of our meal, we decided to check out the fish market side of PAFC and saw that they were selling sea urchin (uni--might be an acquired taste for some!). We inquired about the price and found out that they sold for about $12 a head, including gutting and cleaning right there. We watched out tattooed fishmonger delicately peel and scoop out the roe and place six perfectly formed pieces onto a piece of lettuce in a takeout box. Unable to resist, we ate them on the spot, enthralled at the fresh, quality flavors.  I envy you Pittsburgh-ians!",

In terms of grabbing seafood to eat in the Strip, there is Penn Ave Fish Company, Luke Wholey's restaurant, and Robert Wholey dinning place.  Out of the three, I like Penn Ave Fish Company for their freshness (especially raw fish). Robert Wholey has the deep-fry oyster and soft-shell crabs, but Penn Ave Fish Company certainly has some healthier options.",

    "text": "On my first tour of Pittsburgh, my boyfriend took me to The Strip district. We walked around and planned on eating lunch in the area, so we decided on Penn Ave Fish Co. Upon entering, the atmosphere is a little confusing because the restaurant is split into two sections with various counters within each one.   We just walked to the closest counter and the menu there seemed good, so we quickly placed and order and grabbed drinks in the nearby coolers. I got the seared tuna club sandwich and he got three fish tacos.   Soon enough, our orders were brought to our table next to the register. The crusty ciabatta bread for the club sandwich was so good and the tuna was cooked perfectly. The second layer of the double-decker sandwich had strips of bacon, lettuce and tomato on it. My boyfriend's fish tacos were not the typical fried-fish kind. They had assorted chopped fish in a heavily-spiced taco sauce, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. We traded condiments. He ate his tacos with my side of coleslaw, and I used his spicy mayo with my sandwich.  My sandwich also came with a side of mediterranean chickpea and rice salad, which we were both big fans of. A great lunch idea to DIY!",

    "text": "SETTING: It's like eating inside a fish market! Cool decorations that followed a sea life theme. Random tables dispersed in sectioned areas.   FOOD: So I hear this place has the freshest fish in Pittsburgh? I'm not going to argue with that statement. I saw fish being carted around, iced, and cut. It all happens in house on the one side where you can buy fish by the pound.   We went with the Green Dragon Roll and Fish Tacos. The Green Dragon Roll consisted of shrimp tempura, eel and crab, and avocado.  It wasn't anything special compared to sushi joints I've been to elsewhere (outside of Pittsburgh), but I would say that it's one of the better quality rolls here. Solid roll, no complaints.  Fish Tacos was the main reason I wanted to come here. I'm used to beer-battered fish tacos, so I was excited to try the non-battered version. The Fish tacos consisted of a mix of swordfish, salmon, and tuna in a hard or soft taco shell (your choice) topped with cabbage, cilantro salsa, sriracha. The fish were well seasoned and soft. And they did not skimp on the fish either! Mixed well with the other ingredients, the tacos were packed with flavor. Size was appropriate too. What's not to like!   SERVICE: Little to none. You order up front at the register and then find a seat. I was confused because I did not get a receipt (you don't pay until after you finish eating) or a number or anything! I didn't know how the staff would know who ordered what and where we were sitting. I was more than a little confused and felt there was a holdup because of this system.  It all worked out though. The girl who took our order brought out our food. Then after we cleaned our plates, we went up to pay for it. Of course, we had to tell them what we ordered because there was no previous documentation. I don't know why the transactions are done this way...doesn't seem the most efficient, but hey, they've been doing this for a while and if it works for them, then it works.   IMPRESSIONS: Like a previous yelper pointed out, this place is a bit confusing for the first time visitor. The layout, the ordering, the paying. It's not a big deal now I know how they roll, maybe I just sea things a little differently. But now that I have experienced the delicious seafood, I'm as happy as a clam :).   I would definitely come back though. I am very very wary about eating sushi/raw fish at restaurants in Pittsburgh because I don't know how fresh they are. I mean, I know restaurants that serve fish aren't getting theirs from the Allegheny River, so it must be supplied by a place further out. This is why I always thought the fish in Pittsburgh might not be the most fresh. But at Penn Ave Fish Co? I trust them.   Next time, I'll take a little risk and go raw. I want to try the sashimi!",

You cannot find a better $10 lunch in the Strip District, and if you think you can you are entitled to your wrong opinion.  I loved their sushi!  It was really good.  Like really, really good.

    "text": "Popped into here on a Thursday evening with my gal pal before heading off to a Yelp event. I was pretty excited to visit after hearing great things about it and seeing that their prices in mostly land locked PA were under $10/item. You know I like a good value for my food dollar, so I was pumped.   Once you get past the overwhelming stank of fish, this place grows on you. Ordering at the counter is a breeze and the food came out quickly, but perhaps because we were only one of three other tables there. I wanted to try the soup but they were sold out so I went with just two fish tacos. I didn't eat the tortillas but the fish was excellent, even if it was a little too oily. It was fresh and not old tasting and came with a good pico on top. I'm told they have a taco Tuesday special at a discounted rate. What I also loved is that these weren't trendy (aka miniscule) tacos, they were standard sizing. The waitress/cashier was friendly and helpful when I was choosing what to get. My friend loved her tempura shrimp sushi. The pieces in her roll were big and came 6 per order.   This place has definitely become a little gem along Penn Ave. I'll be back!",

I went on a Wednesday night with two friends before a musical, and we had pretty fast service. (It wasn't very busy.)  I got the Lollipop roll, which is salmon, tuna, and crab wrapped with cucumber --delicious and super healthy. My only complaint is that at $13, I wish I would've gotten more than five pieces because I was still hungry afterwards. It was so good though, I'm still giving this place five stars. I ended up also ordering a Green Fuji Roll ($6), which is salmon, avocado, and scallions. It was also scrumptious.   I want to go back and have more sushi and give their fish sandwiches a try. I've never seen such an exciting fish sandwich menu. There's such a variety and they all sound good. Creative, but not trying to hard to be creative that the dish might not be tasty.

I believe in starting with a California Roll at every establishment.  It's my baseline for comparing sushi.  I broke my own rule a little, and I went with a spicy California roll.  It was, hands down, the best one I've ever had.  The fish was SO fresh.  I mean, SO fresh.  The spicy was perfect, and I have been craving another ever since.

But now I have finally found what I was looking for in Penn Ave Fish Company!   For some reason I had the impression this was a more fancy pricey restaurant so it took me awhile to finally make it down here.  But it's more like a market style casual restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  You can also buy fish in their market to-go though their market selection is much smaller than Wholley's.    My friend and I shared a few sushi rolls and split the fish tacos. The fish tacos, which were a combo of swordfish, tuna and salmon, were amazing. The best I've every had.  And I've had some pretty damn good fish tacos when traveling in Southern Cali or Florida.  Then the sushi rolls were so fresh and amazing with generous portions of fish.  I saw a guy there working on butchering a very large tuna so I know their fish is some of the freshest you can get in Pittsburgh.  Also everything was so affordable and inexpensive!  I will definitely be going back here regularly.",

The sushi man puts so much love and care into these. We ordered 5 rolls. All were excellent. Our favorites were the Bennie and Ron. The tempura in both added some extra crunch.

    "text": "My favorite and go to for sushi in Pittsburgh.  I'm really picky and actually gave up sushi for my first year living in Pittsburgh because the quality of fish sort of sucks here (only really eat sushi and sashimi when I'm home in California or in NYC).  However, I had a really bad craving and finally gave Penn Ave a shot.  Worth it. So worth it. Good portions, prices were good, and service is excellent.  I also buy sashimi grade fish here whenever I want to make poke and sushi at home.  Only thing that's a bit weird is that they have lettuce in some of their rolls (and some other weird combinations)... but it's Pittsburgh, so I just accept it.  I just order it without and they'll accommodate, which is nice.",

    "text": "Awesome seafood. Came here with a date on a Saturday afternoon after walking the Strip all afternoon. We crossed this place and saw $1 oysters and couldn't pass up the deal, I think the happy hour starts at 4pm.   Place is pretty hipster and typical for a seafood market/counter: metal/wood chairs and table; fishing poles/ hooks/ bouy; concrete flooring; clean seafood smell; overall casual set-up.  We ordered the oysters, mussels, and some sushi. The oysters were shucked well and tasted clean. I didn't bother to ask where they were from, but they were good and the cocktail sauce was good as well. The mussels were decent but certainly could have been better; they actually smelled a little fishier than we're used to, however the preparation was tasty with a tomato-based sauce. We ordered a couple rolls and they were also good.   The service was attentive but not too overbearing. Be sure to grab a bottle of water next to the cash register after you order if you're planning on eating there.   Overall, definitely would recommend this place for some good eats and fresh seafood. I'll definitely be coming back next time around.",

    "text": "What an awesome place! It was super bustling. Fish taco Tuesdays are probably the best thing I've ever experienced in my life.... Swordfish, salmon and tuna??? All you can eat for $9???? I would tear this place apart every Tuesday if I didn't live 4 hours away. Sighhh. The tacos were. Amazing. Best I've ever had.  I had the special another Wednesday, and I wasn't TOO impressed by the smoked salmon egg salad sandwich. The Mexican rice was pretty good, but the coleslaw and sandwich itself...mehh... for the price I paid for the amount of salmon...mehh... If I were to come to this place ONLY for fish tacos... they would get 5 stars hands down.  Anyway, I love the decor--hanging seafood everywhere, pretty cool tshirts on sale... minty chocolate at the checkout counter (yum). PS I love that you get your food and eat first then pay. Pretty trippy, right????  Parking...I think it's about luck...both times I've been there we got spots almost right in front. but I can't imagine parking at peak times?? (Especially because it was crappy weather both times we went...in the middle of the day)  Haven't had a chance to try the sushi/sashimi yet, but will definitely do that next time I hit up Pitt or go anywhere near....!",

The menu is filled with a lot of mouth watering options from sandwiches, salads, pizza, to sushi, but I went with a Lunch Sashimi platter with 3 of each type (fluke, tuna, salon, octopus, and crab) and a Fantasy Roll (tuna, avocado, caviar). It was super fresh and melt-in-your-mouth texture. My dad ordered oysters, which were just as yummy and fresh; no strange odors that you get from not-so fresh seafoods. And the mussels that my mom ordered were divine.   The only thing is that the sushi seems a tad expensive, but for seafood this fresh, I think it's worth it. Will come here again!",

    "text": "Kat and Aaron did such a good job describing this place I don't know that I have too much to add.  I had lunch here today and even dealt with the craziness of the strip on a Saturday because I wanted to try a new sushi place.  The atmosphere is very \"yelpy\",,, new word let's all start using it.  I'll defer to Aaron's review for good detail on the space itself.  I walk up to the counter and order the sashimi lunch and also a couple fish tacos.  I placed my order and took a seat.  I'm guessing this place would be okay if you byob for a saturday lunch beer, but I didn't try it.  The fish tacos come out first and they have a great slaw with them and a delicious spicy sour cream type dip to put on the tacos.  The fish is grilled and not fried.  I actually prefer the fish to be lightly fried a la San Diego style.  The taco is piled high with cabbage, cilantro and salsa.  It looks great.  I bite into the taco and sadly the fish is meh'.  It's a mix of overcooked less than fresh tasting salmon and tuna I'd guess.  I'm a bit surprised and a little disappointed.  Then the sashimi arrives.  It's a big lunch portion with a really good variety of beautiful fish.  There are three nice sized pieces of tuna, salmon, octopus, yellowtail and I think something else.  It's cut perfectly and is melt in your mouth delicious.  The wasabi and ginger are also spot on.  This is the best quality sushi I've had outside of UMI in pittsburgh and it's a hell of a lot less.  It was only $9.50 for this large portion of beautiful fish.  Just as a point of comparison I was at umi the other day and got maybe a tablespoon serving worth of fatty tuna for almost $20.  I will frequent here often for this good deal.  I'll chalk up the fish tacos to my fault for coming after the lunch rush when the fish had time to overheat.  The only other thing is that I'm not sure about the tip situation.  I mean the girl brought me my food, but that was about it.  I placed order at the counter and grabbed my own drink etc,,.  I noticed most didn't leave anything I left about 10 - 15%.  Go for a cheap great quality sashimi lunch you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Excellent and fun place to lunch in the Strip.  Visiting from New York City, I was skeptical of a seafood restaurant in the lovely but inland city of Pittsburgh. But I was pleasantly surprised, as the place lived up to its rep.  Interesting setup too: you go up, order, they bring you the food, you pick drinks out of the fridge, and then when you're all done you go up and tell them what you had . . . kind of an honor system (which I'm not sure would work in NYC).  Anyway, the food was simple but very good.  I had a lobster bisque and a blackened snapper sandwich, both of which were excellent. My daughter had mussels with tomato basil sauce, which was also very good.  One thing I don't get is that a majority of items on the menu are served with melted cheese . . . maybe it's me but seafood + cheese: yuck. Anyway, I suppose one could ask to hold the cheese.  It's a fun place in a great neighborhood, the people are nice and the food is very good.",
