I love macaroons and two of the three that I had were crunchy versus having a soft bite. The soup was fine with some bits of chicken and the roll that I requested with it had some plastic wrap within it which was odd. There were a number of people with laptops so could see it being a nice place to get some work done as the place is spacious.",

The chicken was tough (slice against the grain, duh), the cheese was melted to soup, the pickle was chopped into the mix, scattered amount of lettuce, and mushy chopped tomatoes. Please change it back to the original recipe please. Or if you want to change it, make it better, not turn my favorite dish into wrapped mush.",

    "text": "My daughter and I came here for a quick breakfast before visiting the Heinz History Center. She picked this place after reading reviews. We entered into a spacious space with a wall of windows looking out on Carson Street. We were immediately confronted with bakery cases filled with wonderful-looking cakes, cupcakes, bar desserts, macarons, petit fours and other sweet offerings. We surveyed the display but ordered breakfast first. She ordered the eggs, toast and fruit while I selected quiche. The quiche choices were bacon, ham or vegetable, and I chose the ham. Here you order, pay and then take a number for the server to find you when your food is ready. We sat down with our coffee drinks and waited. The service was a little slow even though the restaurant was not busy. After about 10-15 minutes, a woman walked directly to our table with two plates. We could see this was not our order. She looked around to see if the food might belong to another table, but she returned to the kitchen with the food-filled plates. We waited again for 5-10 minutes for another server to bring us our order. My daughter's eggs were adequate for a simple over-easy order of eggs with whole wheat toast and a bowl of fruit. My quiche was not even adequate. The first bite revealed a soggy crust with plain eggs that fell into wet pieces after the first bite. They tasted like very moist scrambled eggs. What made this ham quiche were the diced ham pieces scattered over the quiche and around the plate. Completing this order were spinach leaves and a couple of partially cooked tomato slices. I suggested to my daughter that the good reviews she had read could be attributed to the bakery, but still the quiche...... My daughter went back up to select a couple bakery items to sample later. At that time, there was a line which might be a sign of good things and satisfied customers. She ordered a piece of a lemon bar, another cookie bar with chocolate and caramel, petit fours, and lemon macarons. We left with the box of goodies to try after our museum visit. What a disappointment!  Everything was stale as if it had been sitting in the bakery cases overnight or longer. It was Valentine's Day when we visited, so we expected freshly baked items. The cookie portion of the macaron was hard and crumbled into pieces as we bit into it, although the flavor was quite good. It is possible also that these were overbaked. The other items also did not taste fresh and simply were not very appetizing. After sampling a piece of each, the remainder sat uneaten in a container for a couple days. Eventually they were tossed. Perhaps this was just a bad day, but it is doubtful we will give it another try.",

My boyfriend got a burger and fries, which was overall good, but I got the Mediterranean grilled chicken wrap and it was pretty terrible.   There was nothing Mediterranean or grilled in my wrap at all. The chicken looked like it was boiled and tasted like lunch meat and there were no olives or anything of Mediterranen flavor in the wrap. The menu described it as having a Tzatziki on it but mine has something I would describe as runny mayo. Overall not what I was expecting.  We also got a few desserts. I couldn't resist - all the the desserts look beautiful. We got the cheesecake and and flourless chocolate cake. I was really excited about the flourless chocolate cake because it is my favorite dessert ever but it was COMPLETELY INEDIBLE. It must have been sitting in that case for more then a week. It was ROCK HARD (even after the 20 minute car ride home in 80 degree weather). The cheesecake was not nearly as tasty as I expected and it has a weird layer of \"icing\" on top of the actual cheesecake that I would describe as an overly-sweet whipped slime. The desserts were a feast for the eyes but overall a waste of my money.   I will never buy a dessert there again. I would rather eat Cheesecake Factory's frozen cheesecake then whatever is going on here.",

    "text": "My new obsession!  After driving by Bartram house for over a month and wondering what they had to offer, we finally dropped by for brunch. Since then (just 3 weeks ago) I've been back several times for lunch, brunch, and pastries:)  I've tried the breakfast burrito (served with fresh pico on the side), oatmeal with berries (slightly but not overly sweet, served with strawberries, blueberries and blackberries), Asian salad (mixed vegetables in a delicious sweet chilli soy dressing served on top of iceberg lettuce with wonton chips and cashews) and the chicken tortilla soup (a spicy, salty, bowl of goodness). Everything I tried was incredibly fresh and delicious. The surprise stand outs were the soup and salad! My fiancee loves the pulled pork sandwich, and being from the south and a connoisseur of pulled pork, his approval is hard to come by. Their pastry case is incredible and beautiful. I can't wait to try it all (especially the macaroons!) We now regularly get their blueberry muffins, which hands down are the best we've ever had. We've also tried the cheesecake, and although good, I probably wouldn't order it again (creamy but not very sweet).  What's more? The service is great, and every barista/server we've encountered has been wonderful.  Extra bonus- for those missing almond milk in your specialty drinks since Pete's has closed, Bartram house has got it:) So excited for this to be in our 'hood - looking forward to going back!",

After running, my friend and I decided to grab a quick dinner here, as they also have excellent salads, sandwiches, soups, etc. I had their pick 2 option, and got a cup of tomato basil bisque and a hot ham and cheese sandwich (because who can pass up dipping a hot sandwich into tomato soup during January?). The soup was great, but that sandwich was something else. I was expecting a deli ham and cheese sandwich, but the ham looked like it was freshly carved off the pig, with a pretzel-like bun to match.   After we ate, we obviously had to get some desserts to go. I got a variety of items including macaroons, cupcakes, pastry bars, scones, and croissants. One of the macaroons didn't make it home, and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  The service was also excellent - the staff continuously came around with water (which all of us thirsty runners were thankful), and they offered a free cookie (very good snickerdoodles might I add) to each runner. The restaurant was also very open, roomy and clean, which is always a plus.   Overall, I really enjoyed coming here. I thought the dinner was a little bit pricey, but they do have some specials (not sure if it's a Thursday or everyday thing, but after 7PM the doughnuts, scones, croissants and cupcakes were 2 for $2). I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "As someone who frequents Panera, I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of a casual cafe on the South Side. I work from home and enjoy getting out for lunch or spending a couple of hours working from a coffee shop. So I visited Bartram House a few weeks after opening--expecting it would be a perfect place to enjoy a \"working\" lunch and loiter on my laptop for a bit. Bonus that this is a local establishment!  I noticed how nice the interior is as soon as I walked in. Then quickly spotted the bakery case full of perfect-looking pastries upon approaching the counter to place my order. The lunch menu had a good variety of items, making it difficult to decide, but I settled on a chicken wrap, which came with a side of chips; along with an iced tea; and--not being able to resist trying a pastry--eventually added an apple strudel.   While waiting for my food, I had a seat, got out my laptop, and soon realized that there is no WiFi here. I think this may be the first cafe that I've visited in five or more years that didn't have it? Luckily, I was able to pick up an outside signal as a Comcast subscriber.   My food came out and was fresh, good quality, and quite tasty. However, anything less would have been unacceptable, given the total for my lunch came to $17.77 (I can get a half-sandwich, half-salad, iced tea, and a delicious cookie at Panera for about 50% less). Yikes!  About half-way through, I got up to get some more iced tea and was surprised to find customers have to go to the counter for refills of iced tea or soft drinks, as coffee seems to be the only self-serve beverage. While this seems minor, between the lack of WiFi, the lack of self-serve refills, and just one other person working on a laptop, I definitely got the feeling that this isn't a cafe where lingering is welcomed.  Overall, it's a very nice place with quality food, but quite pricey--especially compared with most other places on South Side. (How about a daily lunch special that includes a sandwich, side, and drink for about $10?) Otherwise, until I'm able to budget more than $15 for lunch and/or Bartram adds WiFi to encourage customers to dally over coffee and a pastry, I'm afraid I won't become a regular anytime soon.",

If you don't feed the parking meter, be careful.  One person did not and the city parking patrol car pulled up and before he got to his car the meter lady already had the ticket printed before she even got out of the car.

We ordered a cheese danish (this is was stale), a breakfast sandwich on wheat (it was 90% bread) and they forget the bacon. My wife ordered bacon and eggs and her bacon tasted like it was bad and her avocado was old (brown and spotted). The coffee they ordered was bad too. The table next to us send back their meals for some sort of correction as well. We will not be returning.",

We placed our order and was given a number and found a table to sit at.  There was plenty of seating available but most of the tables were not so sturdy - we moved around a little bit.  The seating arrangements were pretty close together.  I don't recall any booths just tables and chairs.  This isn't a place where you go to relax.. you just eat and run.   We had to ask for napkins there wasn't any - any in sight there is.  I noticed a lot of customers going to the counter and asking for napkins.   When we arrived at Noon the place wasn't packed but by the time we were eating it was packed and groups of people were coming in.  A waitress/server brought our food out like within 5 minutes maybe.. and it was delicious.  I had the house coffee and it was good.  Everything was fresh and quite tasty.  I was pleased with the home fries, they were seasoned just right.   The prices are a little higher than at a diner or Eat n Park perhaps but you get what you pay for. I did notice after we left that my hair/clothes everything smelled like I was at diner.  Similar to a fried food type smell.  Overall it was a great visit -the cafe and restrooms were clean, the service was good and the food was delicious. I will be visiting again.",

For a sweet ending, I ordered a petit four, which was delicious and a peanut butter cupcake that was also very good. There was plenty of seating and relaxing music, making it a great place to study, read, or catch up with a friend. I certainly plan to return, but will order something different from the brunch menu.",

I've had a few of their salads, my favorite being the Mediterranean Salmon salad, and the Filet.  They have some awesome sandwiches, a killer Reuben, and quality BLT.  I have not got a sweet tooth, enjoy the savory, so I cannot speak to the beautiful cakes, macaroons, pies etc., but have gifted some friends and family with various kinds of those for birthdays, and they have been a hit!",

I had the Mediterranean Salmon salad (pan-seared salmon, mixed greens, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes, banana peppers, red onion, feta cheese, and greek feta vinaigrette dressing). They have a small and large size. I got the small, and to be honest, it was large in my opinion! So to have the big would be massive! Plus it's only $9.99 vs $13.99.   I also loved the dressing and thought the salad was loaded with the good stuff, the toppings. Sometimes they scimp on the toppings, but they didn't. The salmon was a decent size and cooked perfectly too.   Looking forward to visiting again... I'm coming back for the sweets, don't you worry!",

They were almost full. People were having coffee, desserts, and food from the cafe.  When we walked in you could see all of their goodies on display. It was SO hard to choose!  My son got the fruit tart and I got the chocolate caramel bar.  We sat by the window and watched the snow fall. We tried each other's desserts. They were both excellent.  I can't wait to go back and try the cafe food and some of the other treats.",

It came on bread and not an English muffin like the menu says and the avocado was brown, clearly not fresh. I also had the potato soup another time, it was very liquidy with barely any potatoes, pretty greasy tasting. Also tried the buffalo chicken wrap. Wasn't bad except for the fact that the chicken was literally a huge hunk of chicken breast and wasn't cut up at all. Everything about the desserts look like they'd be good when you see them, but I would not recommend anything besides the desserts.",

The location is convenient in my opinion because it's far enough from the bars so that you have metered street parking in the area.   The desserts look so amazing and thoughtful. If I wasn't on a diet I could see myself eating at least 2 every time I went. I first had a soy chai latte and it was good! Hit the spot and was made right. I also had a small strawberry spinach and walnut salad. It was very tasty and I liked that the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was on the side.   Unfortunately I was meeting up with a group. The only thing i would say is that although there is ample space it is lacking outlets for computers. Also the music was way too loud to study. There is free wi-fi though.  Would I be back? Heck yes.",

Today I got the half roasted turkey on brioche and French onion soup.  The Turkey was super dry, not served hot, no cheese and the veggies were old and yellowed.  They forgot the pickle.  The French onion soup tasted like it was several days old and was cold.  When I asked to speak with the manager, I was told they were not there and the cashier tried to take care of me by giving me the option of something different.  I ordered the corned beef sandwich, but that never came after waiting an additional 20 min.  They finally refunded my meal, and were apologetic, but short story, I came in hungry and left even hungrier.  Probably won't be coming back again.",

Everything is beautifully presented. Staff is quite nice as well, event though sometimes the wait in line can be longer than it should be, but their quality of sweets usually makes up for it. I also like the way the whole shop is set out, specifically in summer when they open the doors and huge windows towards E Carson Street. You'll find people studying in there, people just having a cup of coffee, lunch or dessert. I haven't tried any of their other menu so far, but from what I have seen, it looked quite decent. I'll definitely going to give them a try for lunch sometime soon. This place is also good if you're with a larger group as the place is quite huge, but it doesn't feel uncomfortable if you're by yourself just wanting to enjoy a treat!",

Service was incredibly rude here and the food wasn't even all that great. My husband and I were treated with such disrespect that I'm actually kind of upset I even wasted my money. I should've listened to Allison M's advice to \"watch out for the older crabby lady behind the register who clearly hates her job.\"  It was our first time here and we wanted to check out all the beautiful sweets in the window before deciding on what to get. Right as we approached the counter, the woman behind the counter said to another worker, \"are they going to order or what?\" Ok, so we ordered. We ordered a croissant, Danish, and s'mores bar. Without going into detail of the exchange of words as we ordered, I'm going to summarize by saying the woman was incredibly rude, yelled at us for whatever confusion that may have occurred and went as far as saying under her breath \"you don't have to get smart.\" I didn't feel that we were being smart, we were just ordering what we wanted. When she got us the s'mores bar, she threw it into a microwave for about 10 seconds and then threw it right back at us without any sort of enjoy or thank you or anything.   In terms of taste, the Danish was stale and the s'mores bar was underwhelming. For having such a bad customer service experience, I was so hoping that the food would be as good as it looked. Unfortunately, that was not the case and I'm sad to say I will never be back.",

    "text": "I stopped by Bartram House a week ago after an event that I attended elsewhere in the South Side.  I wanted some dessert, and I'd been meaning to check this place out for awhile, so the event gave me the perfect excuse to stop by.  The first thing you'll notice upon walking in is a display case containing many attractive pastries.  After perusing the case, I decided to try the flourless chocolate cake ($5.99).  I found the presentation to be attractive, but the price point to be high, esp. given the portion size.  Upon digging into the cake, I was impressed by its moistness.  It consisted of alternating layers of cake and mousse, providing it with a nice textural contrast.  It was very chocolatey, too, which I appreciated given my love of chocolate.  Despite its small size, it was substantial, and filled me up quite well with chocolatey goodness.  The reviewer who described the vibe of this place as a cross between a Starbucks and a high-end bakery was right on the money.  It definitely has a more corporate feel than most of the other bakeries I've visited around PGH, not to mention a lot more space.  While it's nice that there's ample seating, I detected some snarkiness from the employee who served me when I asked to be seated about 15 min prior to closing (I left with about 10 min. to spare).  While I'm between 3.5 and 4 stars, I'm going to be generous and go with 4 because I was impressed with the quality of the flourless chocolate cake.  I'd return, albeit not quite so close to closing next time.",

I placed my order at the register, took a number and chose a table. I ordered the bananas foster crepes.   They were awesome! Three crepes rolled up with a cream cheese icing filling, covered in bananas foster sauce and fresh bananas. So delicious! My one complaint is that I lost a lot of the cream cheese icing on the plate when cutting the crepes, so that was disappointing haha.   Service was also great!

My mom had a bear claw which she said was more like a bear claw apple strudel very appetizing. My dad had a cinnamon roll I tried it, it was nice and soft, good flavor. Finally my brother had a chocolate croissant I didn't try it but it looked really good. Once we were done we got extra pastries to take home. I absolutely love red velvet, I got a red velvet cupcake, the frosting looked perfect. We also got macaroons, they have a bunch of different flavors of them. We got the raspberry, chocolate, and just regular coconut. We also got a snickerdoodle cookie and a Russian tea cake. I can't wait to try them later everything looked tasty. This place was very nice in the inside also. It's definitely a place for anyone whether you're on a date or going out with your family. Also the people working were very nice and patient even when we were choosing what we wanted to get. Nothing is too expensive, definitely worth it. I highly recommend going here.",

The muffins are absolutely delicious. The So-So: Their quiche (bacon, ham, and veggie) was okay. It was very salty and definitely wasn't what I was expecting - it's a plain quiche topped with the add-ons, not mixed in. Their cookies are also okay, nothing to write home about. The Bad: I was so disappointed when I took my first bite of their brownie. It was hard as a rock and so dry. Definitely would not recommend.   All that being said, the atmosphere is really nice and every person who has ever waited on me has been very pleasant and helpful.   So overall, like most places, Bartram's has some hits and misses, but if you do make your way there, it's very likely you'll find something you enjoy served by a really great staff.",

The wrap cane with turkey, lettuce, onion, tomato, cheese and honey mustard. It was a decent size for $10. The turkey itself was super dry and more of a carved type turkey. Some people may prefer this but I like deli turkey for my wraps. Overall the wrap but good but nothing I would come back for.  I did see they most people recommend breakfast here and that they have turkey sausage on their menu which I love. I'll need to come back to try a different option!",

We walked a block to Bartram and put our orders in within a few minutes.  I ordered French toast and a cafe latte. The cafe latte was done well and full of flavor. The French toast came in thick chunks with sliced strawberries and a separate cup of syrup for dipping. The strawberries were pretty fresh, and the French toast hit the right level of sweetness when dipped in the syrup. It was tasty, and something that I would order again.  We split a vanilla cupcake, which was spectacular. I've found that a lot of fancy bakeries have sad, dry cupcakes with overly sweet buttercream frosting. Not here. The cake was wonderfully moist, and the frosting just set it all off.  Counter service was reasonably quick. Service at the counter and at the table (in terms of bringing out our dishes and taking empty plates away) was efficient and friendly. There is also a whole case of other pastries and baked goods which will get me back in at some point to try out. If you're in the neighborhood and looking for light breakfast or lunch fare, give it a shot.",

Upon entry you can see in their display cases a good number of sweet desserts and even cakes! Yes they have a burnt almond torte which is very popular. During the summer season they serves Hershey's ice cream.  The cafe serves both breakfast and lunch items Panera style. Yes, you can get a type of \"you pick two\" which will include your choice of 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad, or cup of soup.  I opted for the you pick two. Got the strawberry walnut salad and ordered the chicken noodle soup. Standing in the bakery case was a gingerbread man!! I love gingerbread men since they are so hard to find during the Christmas season.  They gave me a number and as usually found a place to sit down. Beverages, including coffee are available at a nearby dispenser. This place also offers complimentary WiFi for the working.  I got my food but was sorry to learn that they had erred in that they did not have chicken noodle soup. I'm not a fan of tomato bisque so I asked for some sweet potato fries as my substitute. The salad was typical but when I got the sweet potato fries they were out of this world good!! They were so thick I really needed a knife to cut them with. They came with a mustard sauce for dipping which made them perfect.  Now onto my gingerbread man. Very soft and tasty. I appreciate the hard work put into making one of these which is why it has become my holiday favorite.  Bartram House is located near Southside works and close to Emilianos. Metered street parking is available or if you are lucky you can park for an hour or two on one of the side streets.  Glad to have found this place. Would love to try one of their cakes on a future visit.",

My boyfriend can eat 6 of their Oatmeal Raisin Cookies in a sitting, easily. We ordinarily stop in on the way to the store for a treat. Today we took the plunge and went in for late breakfast.  We both opted for the Build Your Own Breakfast Sandwich. We're so similar with our food choices, and both got Croissants with Egg, Turkey Sausage, Spinach and Tomatoes. I also had green peppers, red onions and mushrooms on mine. I always want ALL THE VEGGIES. They came out 5 minutes apart, so we both kind of picked at his until mine arrived. The sandwiches are pricey for breakfast sandwiches, but are big and so filling! I also got a Latte with almond milk and gingerbread flavor. I'd say \"Tis the Season\", but I can do gingerbread any time you offer it up. The coffee drinks are always good, and they get their coffee from Prestogeorge. Often it's Highlander Creme or Rainforest Crunch. They have impeccable taste, if I don't say so myself. (Wait that was confusing... I just did say so!)   Anyway, brunch gets loco here, so going a TAD bit later isn't a bad idea if you can help it. Props to their crew for taking the madness well!",

    "text": "Most overrated place I have ever been to in my life.  I feel like I'm paying for their rent because it's so expensive.  Don't get me wrong, I have the money and would love to pay if it were worth it.  Read more to hear real customer feedback experience... The first time I came here I actually typed out a 1star review, but I felt bad at the end so I deleted it...  I waited for over an hour for my food thinking they were just backed up; since it was my first visit I had no idea.  When I finally asked where my food was, the guy at the register got all red in the face and said, \"we forgot.\"  I asked for my money back and got denied; I asked for a cookie or something to compensate the wait and was denied... The 2nd time I wanted to give it a 2nd chance so I didn't order anything that you have to prepare in the kitchen.  Only baked goods, no cooked items.  I was very unimpressed and literally upset when I left. I spent over half a days work on stale baked goods.  If you want great baked items in the area that is very inexpensive, go to Loafers; well worth the money. My 3rd and final experience, I kept an open mind because there really isn't anything else to eat around the area besides fast food and hello bistro.  I ordered a Buffalo chicken wrap.  It took extremely long (over 20 mins) for it to come out, considering I was the only customer.  When they brought it out there was no ranch in the wrap or on the side; the menu claimed to have both.  I waited extremely long at the register for ranch, until they finally told me they are out of ranch.  They could have made more ranch in that amount of time; they could have told me beforehand that they were out of the main ingredient (besides the chicken)...  When I asked for my money back, because I did not take a bite of the wrap, I was again denied.",

    "text": "Let me just list the things that were good before I get to the biiiiiig downer: 1) amazing build-your-own breakfast burrito option with fresh vegis and choice of breakfast meat and cheese. The burrito itself was large and served cut in half, I only ate half and took the other half for later.  2) tantalizing pastries lining the front windows. I got one of each of the 4 mini macaroons they had on display. Mint chocolate was my fav, but all were fresh and crisp.   Now for the bad. I'm not very picky when it comes to coffee, but it tasted burnt. I noticed before I began writing this that other people said the same, so maybe this is a common occurrence? The cups were made of a thick plastic that seemed unusually heavy-duty, so maybe the coffee is melting something off of the cups? Not good.   But the real issue was the service we received. So my friend and her boyfriend ordered two different breakfast burritos. His had mushrooms Amongst other things, hers did not. When the cook brought them out and sat them down, he asked if everything looked okay. She said it looked like hers had mushrooms and she didn't order any. Here's how the rest of the scenario played out, and this is not exaggerated.   Him: if there are a few in there on accident don't worry, they're chopped up small and shrivel up when cooked so you won't even know.  Her: okay... *he walks away but is clearly watching from afar because he returns when she takes a bite and isn't happy. He grabs her plate and said he'd be back. 2 minutes later, he returns with the same burrito and the order receipt   Him: yeah, see it says right here one with mushroom one without. So yours is no mushroom.  Her, getting annoyed but still too polite: I know I ordered no mushroom, the receipt is irrelevant. I don't like mushrooms and this has mushrooms.  Him: *blank stare* Her: *mad now, unwraps burrito and pulls out 5-6 large cut mushrooms mixed throughout.* mushroom, mushroom, mushroom, mushroom. This is not how I ordered my burrito can I please have a replacement?  Him: *takes plate without another word  At this point, I told her I hope she doesn't mind spit more than she minds mushrooms because that's what she's about to get in burrito #2. But in all seriousness, this cook had no restaurant courtesy whatsoever. What happened to the customer is always right? And what was the purpose of taking her burrito away once then bringing it back with the receipt? That's not sanitary and violates basic serving principles. She knew what she ordered, the receipt had it listed and it was still made incorrectly. This happens, so apologize and fix it and all would've been fine and dandy. Why did he at no point offer to remake her burrito instead of arguing, which wouldn't have taken more than 5 minutes?   A different man then came out and asked her to go to the counter and reorder because they threw her original receipt with the order on it away. This one came out correct, from a different cook, and we were all able to enjoy the somewhat unsettling breakfast.   The original cook came out after to halfheartedly apologize but it was clear that he was told to. Later on, he came over to ask if we needed anything. When we said we would like a few to-go boxes, he said we could go get those from the counter. Oh. Thanks for asking but not really? He actually only stopped because the table next to us requested ketchup and hot sauce and we had both and he wanted to know if we were done with it so he didn't have to walk to the back and get new. Wow.   I don't know who this guy was, but he should be kept in the back because his customer service was perhaps the worst I've ever experienced anywhere.  I was visiting these friends for the weekend but they live barely 2 blocks away so they could've been regulars at the bakery. But after this experience, I'd be surprised if they ever returned.",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've felt compelled to write a review, but Bartram House simply didn't match my expectations. I'm happy I visited the store in person before purchasing a cake like I planned to! They need a better ventilation system. A wall of smoke hits you immediately upon entry, and it isn't the usual delicious freshly-baked sweets scent. It just smells like something is constantly burning. The cafe eating space is also dirty. All of the tables had food remnants on them and two had dishes that were from customers who had left in enough time for them to be cleaned. Two employees even made rounds two to three times around the cafe but did nothing to tidy up the tables customers are expected to eat on.  When I arrived I was also hungry and decided to try a breakfast sandwich before I purchased the cake (which I ended up not doing). The total for a croissant sandwich with cheese, egg, and sausage plus a fruit cup came to $16. The food was okay, if not a bit greasy and heavy, but it wasn't worth $16. I've had MUCH better quality and taste in the city for a cheaper price.  Its most redeeming quality was the service! The waiter/cashier/chef(?) at the cashier was attentive and friendly, even though he accidentally forgot a fruit cup I paid for.   tl;dr: the establishment's dirty interior, subpar overpriced greasy/heavy food, and prices overall deterred me from purchasing their cakes and pastries that are left sitting in the cloud of smoke. Will not be returning.",

    "text": "I recently joined a few friends for brunch at Bartram house. The location is in the newer part of the southside near southside works. The inside of the bakery/cafe is very clean and modern. The pastries and cakes are all on showcase on the counter. I think I gained 5 lbs just looking at the sweet goodness. Unfortunately for me, I'm on a (temporary) dairy free diet. Therefore, I had to pass on all of the deliciousness that was taunting me as I placed my order at the counter. The staff was very accomodating of my special diet. I chose the half sandwich and salad combo. I went with  the California club (minus the Swiss and the pesto) and the harvest pear chicken salad (None the blue cheese). We then waited at our table until our meals were delivered. Both my sandwich and my salad were very good, I imagine they would have been even better without my adjustments. The chicken was very moist and the bread was soft and delicious. However, I was rather disappointed that my Harvest pear chicken salad was missing the pears. Though, I didn't bother to ask for it to be corrected. Overall, there are great options here for savory and sweet dishes.",

I have been here in Pittsburgh over a year now, and don't have time to eat in so I have frequented various places and now am finding my \"pit-stops\" depending on what I am craving. I noticed Bartrams House open last week sometime, Was really hungry this morning and stopped by to grab a breakfast sandwich. I was impressed with how they have setup the inside of this establishment. They took my order really quick, it was a relaxing environment, grabbed a number and had a seat and just enjoyed looking at how they have preserved the architecture of this historic building and managed to convert it into bakery/cafe/breakfast sandwich, nicely done!  I ordered an egg cheese croissant. I was impressed with how they prepared it and how quick it was ready. What I really appreciated was that I didn't even look at the menu, they made exactly what I had asked for. I do look forward to stopping by again soon.   I usually don't right a review unless I'm really impressed with the place. Whats the point of writing something bad and harming someones business, any how that just my opinion.",
