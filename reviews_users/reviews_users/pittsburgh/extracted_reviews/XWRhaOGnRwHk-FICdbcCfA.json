I had the southwest scramble and my partner had the Big John breakfast sandwich  (I think that was the name) with Italian sausage. The food was excellent and it was great to know that some of the ingredients were locally sourced. The coffee was simply the best restaurant coffee I've ever had. The owner waited on us, which was a nice touch. She provided excellent service. We loved the decor and atmosphere. There was nothing negative about our experience whatsoever. We're recommending Nancy's to all of our friends!",

Note to owners: If you are going to charge almost as much as a loaf of fresh bread for two slices, you probably shouldn't use the tiny little end cuts. $10 for the most basic breakfast (without a drink) in a dirty place? No thanks.I can do way better in most any other neighborhood in the area and still get the character.",

For under $10, you can get a good cup of coffee, eggs, meat, home fries, and toast, which is a deal that can't be beat in the East End.  I would love to see Nancy's add a fresh side option to their breakfast menu. I realize greasy diner food is much of Nancy's appeal, and I'm rolling my eyes at myself right now, but sometimes I wish I could get a simple side salad or a quartered tomato with my breakfast instead of home fries and toast. A breakfast of purely protein and carbs can really hit the spot, but it would be nice to have the option of a lighter, more colorful breakfast.",

There were two counters for people to eat, plus about 7 booths that reminded us of old schoolhouse seats. It was pretty busy and we were surprised we were seated so quickly. J ordered coffee and the classic breakfast with bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, and home fries. I had mint tea and an omelet with toast. Everything was pretty decent. What really struck us was how friendly everyone was. There was a guy who was picking up breakfast for elderly church goers. He seemed to be a regular because he knew the staff on a first name basis. Before he left, he purchased a meal for a homeless woman, which really touched us. If people like that frequent this place, it is definitely worth it.",

Add peppers + onions to the home fries, but for the best version, swing by on a weekday - that short order cook is on it! The house coffee is also above average, but the mugs are small so drink up.

There was no place to sit except at the counter when we entered. We took a seat and scanned the menu. My daughter ordered an omelet with home fries, and I chose the grilled havarti and apple sandwich on raisin bread. My sandwich was delicious...a great combination. The owner told me the apple butter gave it that extra taste boost. My daughter also gave high marks to the omelet. We shared the home fries which we would have liked fried just a little bit crispier. Conversation also made this diner quite enjoyable. We struck up a conversation with a 'regular' seated beside me. He showed me some interior pictures of the Singer House which I visited (outside only) on the Vacant House Tour. He also had some interesting pictures of the vault inside the Union Trust Building downtown. We talked about this Wilkinsburg neighborhood where he had grown up. We also talked with the owner about this diner which has been there for years but now under his ownership for only a year or so. Great place for breakfast if you're in the neighborhood. I plan to visit over and over and try some other items, especially dessert. The morning we visited, they were offering sweet potato pie; we were just too full to give it a try. Then there is the Leona's ice cream on the menu. All the more reason to go back for dessert.",

However I went this weekend, stone cold sober, and dang. It's good. Really good. I'd go so far as saying the best diner good I have ever had. For starters the coffee is beyond legit. It's easily the best tasting cup of coffee I have had in a restaurant that wasn't a coffeeshop. I believe when we went it was Tanzanian Teaberry (Is that correct?). Then the food. My god, the food. I had the vegetable omelet but asked for it to be scrambled with homefries, and had rye toast. All great. All of it.

Menu is fairly typical small diner fare.  I got a greek omelet with home fries and toast.  The food was simple and tasted homemade, and the homefries were tasty.  Interestingly, I got them with peppers on it, and the peppers were generously piled on top - but had a slightly tangy, vinegar like taste - from that and the texture, they seem to have been pickled.  It tasted a bit odd - but it was still very tasty.  From pictures other Yelpers posted, I have seen home fries with fresh peppers, so maybe they just ran out?    This is a simple, reasonably priced little diner in Wilkinsburg, that also has plenty of parking - a nice plus for me for this type of place.  It is a metered lot where I think 1 quarter bought me 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The best part about this place was the staff.  Anyone can tell immediately that I am not from the area - and I can sometimes been stared at like an alien when going to some of the smaller towns around Pittsburgh.  Here I felt comfortable and welcome, and was greeted with smiles.  I will go to this place again when I am in the area.  Also, they serve breakfast all day!",

And on a personal note in today's economy all customers should be important to you.  And by the way I never asked for a refund and both orders were incorrect in fact I was placing another order and only asked that you as the business owner make it right by giving the homefries that should have been on prior order; so instead you would rather lose a customer over $2.49?

I was not expecting free Mancini's bread and high end prosciutto as sandwich tray selections. This is also including unique local beverages like Red Ribbon's Mint Ginger Ale in a bottle! Super refreshing on a Pittsburgh stuffy day. Jordan ensured that everyone in the program got to order off of the  diverse menu and personally delivered the meals. A1 service and yummy food. Try the Cobb salad, fresh and enough for a second round.",

I thought surely he was vested in the business, only to find out that he'd worked here less than two weeks.",

I've never had their food truck food, but I like the idea of a small business in Wilkingsburg that hires people other employers avoid (the homeless, ex-prisoners) and want them to succeed. They partner with other local enterprises, like Leona ice cream and Red Ribbon glass-bottled sodas. We tried their Fish Fry Friday menu and will probably be back for other things, since they're not a far walk from our house. There's good people-watching through the big plate-glass windows out front, or you can ogle a wall full of old photographs while you eat. The kitchen is fast, and they have free WiFi while you (don't) wait.",

I have been back five times since it changed hands and every time I am left desiring. Nothing is that good, nothing feels comfortable and worse I feel the youthful chili guy could care less about my business. I love breakfast spots and Pittsburgh has a shortage. I will come back but I think the hash browns are not what they used to be, chili is ho hum, no longer sell Dana Bakery doughnuts, the food is fair and the community I appreciated is not here for me.

It was clean and the staff were friendly. I ordered the southwestern omelette and my hubby got the italian scramble. Literally one of the best omelette's I have ever eaten in my life and super filling. I feel like a beached whale right now.

Prior to visiting Nancy's East End Diner this Saturday morning, Fred's Diner in Akron and Summit Diner in Somerset were the undisputed top.  Nancy's has dethroned them both and it is now our absolute #1 diner regardless of state or location.  Here are the reasons we have put Nancy's at the top of our list:   Overall Ratings: Food Quality - Six Stars Cleanliness -   Five Stars Staff -              Six Stars Price / Value - Five Stars  Food Specifics:  Home Fries -  Absolutely the best home fries we have found to date. Excellently cooked, fresh cut potatoes and the addition of onions and peppers that are also sliced and cooked make these home fries absolute perfection.   Eggs -  Fresh, large and high quality eggs cooked exactly to order.   Sausage Patties - Meat sourced from a local butcher in Bloomfield with your choice of regular or hot. Excellent flavor and nice portion size.   Pancakes - Nancy's makes their pancakes \"crepe\" style, meaning they are thinner and have crispy edges. This is the same type of pancake that Pamela's in Pittsburgh is famous for but these are better.   Coffee - Better than average and cup was kept full without waiting.   Toast - This is the only item we would rate as \"average\" with the standard toast being small in size and nothing special. Nancy's offers Mancini toast for an upgrade but we did not try that option.   Do not let the outside appearance deter you from giving this hidden gem a try, you won't be disappointed!!!!!!",

They are tucked away from the main thoroughfare and have their own parking lot. It was busy on the day I visited but there was no wait for a table.  Menu consisted of breakfast and lunch options. When I saw grits on the menu, I knew it would be righteous. Meals are cheap and service is great. My over medium eggs were cooked well with a couple slices of bacon to top it all off. The plates delivered to the other tables looked good too. Can't wait to try other menu items.  The staff here is just happy and show their appreciation for your patronage. A win in my book..I'll be back.",
