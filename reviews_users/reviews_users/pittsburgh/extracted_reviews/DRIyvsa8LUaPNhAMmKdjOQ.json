I especially liked their breakfast potatoes, and I had a yummy Belgium Waffle with all their toppings. The cost seemed pretty good - it was $8.95/adult for the brunch buffet and there was plenty of food.  It seemed like a nice cozy place and we definitely want to come back to try a regular meal here.  The front part is a bar area, which does seem a little older like some reviewers have said.  The back part was the cozy dining area.  They also have two outside deck areas that people were using.",

Fries tasted like grease hadn't been changed in months, and burger was not prepared how I asked for it to be, there was raw meet on my knife when I asked for it to be prepared medium.  The waitress was very nice and gladly got me a different menu item in its place.  The owner manager on the other hand was very unprofessional about the situation.  She proceeded to boast to wait staff and patrons at the bar about how perfect the burger was cooked and that it should not be replaced.  She then proceeded to come to our table in the dining area and tell us how a  medium burger should look, that see eats her burgers medium and it was perfect.  She did not even want to hear what our problem had been and continued to talk over us and walked away without even listening us or even apologizing about the meal.  Next she proceeded back to the bar well within our hearing range, and complain about us more.",

Come here for the Sunday Brunch and you'll be swept away by the gloriousness that is their Parmesan garlic potatoes. These are so delicious I could eat a whole plate of just potatoes. Beyond the starchy goodness, there's also bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, fruit, pasta, chicken, made-to-order omelets and waffles with toppings. The service has always been great and the price is very reasonable. We come here several times a year and never leave disappointed.",

    "text": "I don't like giving just one star, though I was tempted. I realize that you have to take some places for what they are. Middle Road Inn is a bar. It's a dive with a nice lodge-y feel to it, and has a large bar space and several flat screens. We found it through Yelp after visiting the Hartwood Acres dog park. We checked the opening time (noon) and figured we'd stop in around 12:30 to watch some of the Pens game.   The bar tender was anything but friendly. She made it clear that she was in the process of opening, and didn't want to help us. I can understand when you are just opening you could be a bit frazzled, but she was so rude about it. Plus, don't advertise to be open at 12 and not have your shit together by 12:30. My boyfriend (in a timid way cause she was pretty threatening) asked if he could get a water, she said \"no - I just opened so I don't have ice.\" OK, well, that's that.  A bit later once our drinks were slammed down in front of us, we ordered food. I ordered a veggie wrap with no fries or coleslaw. The food was awful in my opinion. BF isn't picky at all, and gobbled his greasy buffalo chicken wrap down. I really can't even look at coleslaw, and don't eat deep-fried foods, so I almost threw up when my veggie wrap came with fries and coleslaw ON it. There's no way around that , so I just pushed it away and ate chips. I didn't say anything to the bartender because honestly, I didn't want some spitfire remark. So I silently boxed up the wrap and saved it for the BF for later.   It was just a bad experience, and for drinks, it's not a bad place at all... except for the service. So, just won't be back here.",

    "text": "This restaurant restored my faith in finding good food in Pittsburgh.  So, I'm a recently transplanted California food snob and was sure the fare I found in the east would be less than impressive. I was proven wrong by this little gem.   They have an extensive menu along with daily specials at mid-range prices. So far we've enjoyed the fettucini (w. chicken & scallops), french onion soup, crab bisque, chicken marsala, and fish dinner.   Pasta sauces are incredible, serving sizes are very large and the dish flavors have been mostly fantastic. The chicken marsala was a little bland, as was the fish dinner. (The warm bread they serve is also delicious).  Atmosphere is casual, one side of the place is a bar, but it's still pretty quiet in the dining room.   Service leaves a lot to be desired, though and is the only thing breaking Middle Road Inn from a 5-star review. We've had the same waiter both times we dined there, and it's been comically disappointing. Not very friendly, not very knowledgeable, more than a little awkward, and, a big pet peeve of mine: doesn't clear dishes from the table as you finish. Both times we ended up with stacks of dishes from our appetizers, dinners, and drink refills.   But overall the food and creativity makes up for it. Big kudos to the chefs here.",

Maybe they just redid it or something. Anyway the dining room was PACKED tables close together with the buffet line intertwined... But they asked us if we wanted to sit on the patio and we were like YAS!! the deck was super cute, big and open we had plenty of room. The food on the buffet was mediocre in my opinion...but the made to order omelettes were a hit with my fam and the fresh waffles were fluffy and delicious. Shrimp cocktail was on point too.

I wouldn't make a special trip across town to eat here.  Wow factor?  NONE.  My biggest gripe about Middle Road Inn?  The menu on their website! The menu on their website, to the best of my knowledge, hasn't been updated in probably a few years (at least).  What I mean by this is that the prices on their menu on the web seem to be from the 1970's as well.  Middle Road Inn, get with it already.",

Communication about my wishes for the party went smoothly, I was kept informed throughout as to what my bill was going to be, service was perfect and everyone was taken care of. The guests all raved about the food (large whole wings, pizzas, delicious meatballs on crostini, freshly made fruit salad), how beautiful and bright the room was, and again, the great service. They even helped me box up the leftovers in containers I provided! And just stopping by for dinner is great too-lots of choices on their menu!

Usually French onion is too salty for me, but I was chilly (not due to the restaurant) so I thought I would give the French onion a try. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of cheese on top, which I like because I didn't feel like all I was eating was melted cheese in the first few bites. Too my surprise, the soup was not too salty either. Win win!   I ordered the penne vodka and added chicken to it. The pasta and the sauce were great, and since we had an appetizer, I was able to save half of my dish for tomorrow. The chicken pieces were a little on the over cooked side for my taste, but the flavor was good.   We ended up splurging and buying a piece of the chocolate cake to go. From appearances, the cake looks like it's going to be delicious, but we haven't eaten it yet!   Overall, I think we found a new place to frequent that isn't far from home.",

We started with fried zucchini, which were delivered in six ginormous strips. They were good, but the batter was severely lacking salt.  Both of us got burgers. Mine was pretty solid, except the bottom bun got slightly soggy as I was eating it. The burgers are served with chips, which I thought would be made in house, but it was basically a bag of Lays poured onto my plate.  It wasn't a bad meal, just pretty mediocre. Service was good; the server we had was very sweet and attentive.",

    "text": "This is the first time I ever went here. And unfortunately it will be the last.   First we did have a big group with some kids. So the deck worked well for us outside.   There was a reversal wedding dinner inside which took up half the room. The other half was a little league baseball team. Weird mix right...  We had a nice waitress and she did a decent job. But could have gotten us lots more drinks. She just didn't check in with us enough.   Now the food was just awful.   Here is each review:  Fried fish sandwich- good breeding but it's the same for all their fried food. The small is a huge portion. No need for the large. Bun size was nice but I only ate the fish.   They served their cocktail and tarter in the smallest pre portioned containers. No joke I used 16. 8 of each.   The fried zucchini was good but needed salt. Again huge portion.   Artichoke Romano was the worst dish I ever ate. Seriously. The batter was raw and so thick.   Someone got a burger order med temp. It came out rare. We sent it back and they just out the burger in the oven on the same plate. So when it came back out the plate was on fire. And guess what the burger was still rare. How could they just not start over and cook a new one. This is just unthinkable.   Sorry but will never go back to this place. Too bad because it could have such potential.",

It's buffet style and there isn't much breakfast food to choose from, but what's there does not disappoint. You won't find powdery eggs here or rubbery sausage. They also have mimosas, which aren't necessarily their strong suit but will work if you're desperate. The service is always great and they have plenty of room for large groups. I highly recommend the Middle Road Inn!",

App fav are the zucchini and the meatball crostini. My hubs loves all the craft beer including a ton on tap. Pretty impressive for a local suburban bar. I see some bad reviews about the owner and I have never know her to be anything but sweet and offer suggestions on new crafts for hubs to try. So I take what others said with a grain of salt. We've also been to Sunday brunch. It's good, very reasonably priced, wish some Things got switched out every once in a while. Overall this place hits all high points! Go now before the secret is out!",

The dinners are usually pretty good and very affordable.  However, I made the mistake of going here for brunch. The service was horrific, despite only being half full. It took 30 minutes to get a drink and we never got any refills, even after flagging people down repeatedly. My daughter was net l nearly in tears.  The food on the buffet was mostly old and cold, only a couple things got refilled. And they must have been drunk when they decided on the menu, it made no sense and nothing went together. I would not recommend the brunch at all.",
