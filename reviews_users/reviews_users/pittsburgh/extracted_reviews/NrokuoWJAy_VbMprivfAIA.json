    "text": "As I haven't been able to grow the extra stomach I've been asking Santa for since I was 9, this is less of a review of the shop as a whole, and really just a review of one pizza.  But it was a damn good pizza!   Molly's isn't the newest pizza shop on the Dormont block, with Campiti's being the veteran AND it's neighbor two shops down.  And while their signage is a bit odd for a pizza shop (just a cameo-style head on a yellow background), don't be scared off!  I got a bit of a wild hair going places that wild hairs go, and decided to give Molly's a shot.  A quick look over their menu, which is pretty diverse in topping AND crust styles, I settled on a deep dish with homemade hot sausage and mushrooms.  As deep dish goes, it's not strictly Chicago-style, but it looks a hell of a lot closer to it than most places.  The crust was more akin to a breadstick, with some parm sprinkled on top.  Well cooked, loaded with toppings, and so tasty I had 4 slices....I'm still full 3 days later.  The shop itself is clean, spacious, and quick.  Their website is loaded with coupons, deals, and specials.  They're doing it all right at Molly's, and that's alright by me.",

I ordered drinks with my order and after we hung up, they noticed that they didn't have the pop. The delivery guy, on his own will, went to the gas station (to make sure the drinks were cold) to get me what I ordered. He could have called me to let me know that they didn't have the drinks but no, he wanted to make his customers happy. Not only did he do that, they gave me a discount for the miscommunication. He got a good tip and the first time ever, I called the manager to give the delivery guy a great review. Keep it up!!! Great service and food!!!",

I was a long-time customer of Little Chicago's in the South Side and, in my opinion, they did it right! Molly's is close, with the exception of the tomato topping. There just wasn't enough, for my taste. I have yet to find a pizza place in Pittsburgh that does it like Little Chicago's and that's unfortunate because there's was awesome! Maybe a change to the assembling is in order? I think it would definitely help. Don't get me wrong, the pizza did taste good...I just think it could be a lot better with more tomatoes.",

My 5 star review is based on the fact that you can get a really stinkin good pizza for $7 on Monday or Tuesday night with their take-out special. Living in Dormont I'm not at a loss for pizza options. It seems like Dormont has more pizza places than I've ever seen. I like sweet sauce on occasion, and I like Beto's but have to be in the mood for Beto's. Sometimes I just want a good standard pizza and Molly's is the place for me. The sauce isn't sweet which I prefer, and they put enough on it. I can't stand when I order a pie and get a big dough ball with a tiny layer of sauce. The cheese and crust are good as well. I haven't tried the subs, but according to other people they are great. The people working are always friendly. For a good standard pizza that I feel is 10 times better than the chains, try out Molly's!",

    "text": "I wish I could choose 0 stars. Molly's lost a customer in us on Saturday night. There is too much competition in the area to settle for horrible customer service, receiving the wrong orders twice and being over charged. We ordered 1 Cajun steak hoagie which was on special for $2 off the whole hoagie...we also ordered a Philly steak...and a pizza with pepperoni mushrooms and onions..not that difficult. We received 2 Cajun steak hoagies at full price...And a sausage and mushroom pizza. When we called to let them know about the mistakes, we were put on hold 3 separate times and then they had to speak with a manager to see if it was ok to rectify their mistake. I asked to speak to the manager and was told that I couldn't. They did replace the pizza...they did not fix the overcharge or the fact that they sent the wrong hoagie. I called twice asking to speak with a manager and both times I was denied.  We will not order from Molly's again. How they were voted best is beyond me. The food was mediocre at best. The Cajun hoagie had so much seasoning that I found it inedible and Dominos pizza is better than what we received. Too many good pizza delivery places in the area to waste 40.00 on food that was basically inedible, the staff desperately needs to learn customer service because not one person apologized for their mistake and acted like we did something wrong. Next time we'll spend our money at one of the other delivery places in the area. Molly's, I hope the 4.00 overcharge, poorly trained staff, and miserable delivery driver don't cost you more customers.",

We were at a neighbor's house the other day and they said that Molly's was their favorite pizza. Hmmm, I remember Molly's!  So tonight my lovely bride suggested that we call Molly's and try their deep dish pizza. The young lady on the other end of the phone was pleasant enough. The estimate was forty minutes, the delivery person pulled up right on time.   The pizza itself is quite good, I have traveled to Chicago many times, Molly's has gotten Chicago style deep dish pizza right, or certainly as close as any pizza shop in Pittsburgh should be expected to. The sauce is spicy and a little sweet, the toppings were generous and the crust was just right.  We won't wait five years for out next pizza from here!",

And the delivery is usually faster then what they say. I have had only one negative experience when I was put on hold and forgotten about, but being that it was a game night and it was probably very busy, I'm not holding that against them seeing as it hasn't happened since. When we went there to eat, the staff was very attentive and tried to make us as comfortable as they could and were very nice. When I order take out they are always offering to help me to the car.

I went in when it had just changed over from Adrian's, and I think I was just pissed they changed ownership, so I didn't like it. I've been twice more since moving to Dormont and I can confidently say I'm a fan! I like pizza that has a lot of sauce and a doughy crust. This pizza has both! Plus, they have fresh mushroom toppers, which is a plus considering a lot of places will throw on that canned crap. Ew!  This last time we also tried their Molly's bread. It's ooey gooey cheesy bread and it was good. A bit greasy, but greasy in a good way and not a gross way, I promise! They also include a huge cup of sauce, which is a plus on my part because I love extra sauce!  Thank god I can put faith in this joint's pizza once again!",

I hope you've got your Pittsburgh pizza pants on and are poised and prepared to party! (Alliteration gives me chills!)  Truth bomb: South Hills pizza may be outdoing Pittsburgh's \"Little Italy\" (Bloomfield) by a long shot. Once of the most recommended and most delicious is Molly's. I've ordered from them for delivery twice now in the almost month I've been \"Beech-livin'\" and I'm a happy customer, to say the least. Quick efficient staff on the phone, about 45min/1 hour delivery time on average, and a slightly below par website (menus are difficult to view).   On to the pizza... Hello, beautiful! A chewier crust, nice and thin though. I ordered extra cheese (because I love my cheese) but I always try to keep my first sacred slices plain. I let it sit for a little while to cool down as I don't particularly love a piping hot slice. The cheese was flavorful and the sauce was on the lighter side, which I prefer.  A True test of my pizza scoring would be the \"Tomorrow Slices.\" What is a Tomorrow Slice you may ask... a Tomorrow Slice is that coveted slice of pizza you eat the next day (I prefer mine cold or room temperature.) and savor the True taste once all the ingredients have had time to mingle. The last time we ordered from them we decided to switch it up and go with subs. We heard great things about the Pittsburgh Peppercorn Cheesesteak and I stuck with my standby of Buffalo Chicken.  I've not had a single thing from them that I don't like, the people are always courteous and efficient. I can't ask for more in a local pizza shop.",

I called and the same girl who answered the first time initially blamed it on me giving her the wrong phone number (I never gave her a number, which I felt was strange considering they generally ask for one). Once it was established that the food was taken to the wrong place she insisted that they would have it delivered to me soon. No apology was offered.  I have now been sitting her for ANOTHER hour! It's a good thing I had some chicken defrosting.",

At 9:50 we call no answer we call at 9:52, 9:54 and again at 9:56 till my phone just gives up hope of anyone coming to our food hungry aid and hangs itself up at 9:59. Obviously my phone has come to the realization that in my best guess is that whoever is closing this place is just laughing at the phone ringing while pleasing himself into their ingredients, who knows? What else are they doing with the time they could be making what I'm sure are delicious hoagies. Who knows? All I know is that it's 10:11 and my pregnant friend and her husband and hungry child are sitting at home watching tv wishing their stomachs were full!",

    "text": "I don't understand what everyone else is raving about when it comes to Molly's.  For an establishment to receive my repeat business, it has to impress me somehow-- be it by practicing exceptional customer service, by having an amazing product, or by offering something incredible I can't get anywhere else.  I would rate Molly's customer service as nothing above \"acceptable,\"  the food can be described as nothing better than \"edible,\" and I don't believe there's anything unique on the menu.  I won't be going back.  We decided to get dinner from Molly's because we had been consistently and repeatedly let down by Giovanni's (another pizza place about a mile away from Molly's), and the reviews for Molly's were overall more favorable than the reviews for Campiti's (a few doors down from Molly's).  I called at about 7:20 pm on a Saturday night and the woman answering the phone asked me if I could hold.  I replied \"Sure,\" and after being on hold for 2 and a 1/2 minutes, I suggested we just go down to Molly's to place our order in person since we were going to pick it up anyway.  When we got there, the woman behind the counter said: \"I'll be right with you,\" and we proceeded to stand there from anywhere from 3-5 minutes while she set up a delivery with some other customer on the phone.  No smile in her greeting at all.  Now, I don't expect to be treated like royalty when I walk into an establishment, I understand I'm not the only customer, but between being put on hold for over 2 minutes when I called and being made to stand there at the counter and wait for her to be available to take our order for over 2 minutes, it was obvious to me that this woman was being given more than she could handle.  I write it in every restaurant review, but for all I know this is the only review of mine you're reading, so I need to let you know where I'm coming from-- I've worked in customer service and as a server.  When a customer walks into your place of business, they should be welcomed as a guest in your home.  I would probably be a lot less pissy about being made to wait if the woman behind the counter at Molly's had made the slightest effort to smile or bring a hint of cheeriness to her voice.  Maybe she was having a bad night, maybe she was busy, I get it, but it's not personal, it's business.  A gentleman who was in the back making food greeted us and stopped what he was doing to come forward and take our order.  I didn't mention that I had been made to wait for 2 minutes on the phone when we tried to initially call our order in.  We told him it was our first time there, how it smelled good in there, and we were excited to get one of that week's specials, which was if a customer spent over $15, they got free macaroni and cheese bites-- which were little clumps of mac & cheese fried with a side of some marinara sauce.  I ordered a \"specialty\" pizza- the roasted garlic pizza, and my hubby ordered a \"traditional\" pizza with pepperoni and onion.  The gentleman took our payment and told us it would be ready in about 15 minutes.  We went for a walk, came back, and the food was ready in 15 minutes, which was great.  I'm glad we patronized an establishment that at least gives out realistic measurements of time as to when the food will be ready.    Less than 10 minutes later we were home, taking our first bites, looking at each other and asking: \"What's the big deal?\"  I didn't notice any fatty pieces on the chicken on my pizza, which is the first time I've experienced that at any pizza joint anywhere, so obviously my food was prepared with some level of care.  My hubby said: \"Eh, that's pretty good,\" but he didn't want to save the 2 slices he didn't eat at that time for later, which is not how things usually go when we get pizza from other places.  Neither one of us ate more than 2 of the (free with our order) macaroni and cheese bites.  I'm really glad we didn't pay for them.  Personally, I say go if you want, maybe your experience will be better than mine (ours) was, but don't believe the hype of other reviews for this place-- keep your expectations realistic.  Most other reviews I read on yelp are what swayed me to go and frankly, I think other reviewers are either easily impressed or maybe I caught Molly's on a bad night, I don't know.  What I do know is that Molly's won't be getting any more of my money for their overall barely average performance in terms of quality of food and service.",

    "text": "I am so confused as to why Molly's has such a poor rating on here. I lived in Dormont for two years about a year ago right down the street from Molly's on Glenmore and Potomac, this was before Molly's was on grubHub. Living so close by we ordered often, a quick call to place the order and we would walk up in 15 mins to hot delicious food to take home. We have gotten the various steak hoagies, Emily's garlic bites, the pizza with all kinds of toppings, and the steak salad, my key go-to. All items listed were exceptionally good and I never had an issue with the customer service, the owner being one of the nicest people I have met in Dormont. The only small issue I had was with a younger girl in her early 20's maybe, that just hated working it seemed. She could get a bit rude when I walked in to pick up the food. But other than that I have never had a complaint.   The folks in there are always pleasant and they make a killer pizza. So killer in fact we still order from there now that we've moved to Beechview. And now that they have the broaster we order even more often, more recently we got boneless wings what were perfectly cooked, sauced and seasoned. With all of the pizza places in Dormont this is by far the best and it's awesome that it's family owned. Go support this local business and get some pizza in your belly!",

I've noticed when they have a influx of younger people on staff that's when your going to get super dry or half burned hoagies. Missing items and warm salads.  I would say it's a toss up 50/50 if your going to get a good meal or be disappointed. Delivery is super slow even if your a few blocks away. I do like they offer online ordering but the fees are way too much. Dormont is saturated with pizza shops and Molly's ranks up there on the list but it's no longer #1. I found lil Caesars to have better consistently so that's saying something. I'll still order from time to time but I'll never expect to be impressed like once was.",

I'm from Buffalo and am here with my family on vacation on a Tuesday and where Vocelli's let us down with closing 2 hours earlier than their advertised time and saying they were only doing pickup (Vocelli's also lists delivery 7 days a week, a lie apparently), MOLLY'S not only delivered, the food was delivered/arrived at 10:10, they close at 10:00! The guy even said he'd apply a coupon. Mind you, we called at 9:20, what wonderful service!  I know we're in Pittsburgh but their authentic Philly was certainly authentic and hit high marks with me. Good cheese sauce and steak (and juicy sub steak flavor along with onions. In Buffalo we take our pizza serious and we ordered a personal for the kids. The best in PA I've had yet. My wife also enjoyed her turkey sub but could only finish half. The bread is quite big and heavy. Maybe our only complaint and it's not much of one. Whole family of 4 fed for $25 too.   Sorry the photos aren't so appealing, we were starving after the other local establishment let us down and scrambling. I'll remember Molly's for coming through for us.",

Delivery is fast, everyone is nice, prices are reasonable. Good salads & hoagies too. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "In a city that has its pizza challenges, this one is by far the worst I've experienced. On a cold New Year's Eve my daughter and I stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered 3 slices... well, we are the only ones waiting and 20 minutes into it I asked \"any word on our order\"? The reply, from the clueless counter girl is \"what's the name on your order\".... okay, I'm annoyed. The slices come out and the cheese is ripped off of mine. There no garlic, the community spices were sticky, the sauce is sweet, the crust is a bubble display -- no, just NO! To top it off, the bathroom smelled like a horse stable. Filthy",

I feel like it's a bit on the pricey side, but considering the food and service has been good, it's worth it to me.   Update: tried their Stromboli and I liked it - my picky eating 6 yr old even ate some of it.",

    "text": "I stopped in on a whim and wish I hadn't. I ordered 1 slice of pepperoni pizza. I waited so long for it that I thought they were out growing the wheat, milking the cow, and killing the pig. Okay, that bit was an exaggeration but my paid parking ended at 3:45. I got back to the car at 3:55. The only other thing I did was stop in a shop for tea so I'm guesstimating it took them 20 minutes to warm up one slice. I honestly did wonder if they were cooking a whole pie just to get me that slice. The young woman who brought it to me did apologize so I'm guessing that's not a normal wait time.  I wasn't impressed with the pizza. I like a thinner crust although that's a matter of taste but the taste wasn't all that. There wasn't enough cheese or sauce which, really, is the whole point of pizza. Also, given the wait, while the edge of the crust was hot, the middle of the slice was lukewarm.   A ridiculously long wait for almost reheated, bland pizza? I don't think so.",
