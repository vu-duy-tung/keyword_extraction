The history of Primanti's has always fascinated me as well - the steel workers would put everything plus their sides (fries and coleslaw) on their sandwich to save time at lunch and get back to work. Good thing they did and now we all enjoy it today - whether it be for lunch, dinner, during sporting games, or at 3am after you've been out with your friends! Saturday night after a friends birthday party, we stopped at the one on 18th and Carson in the South Side. This one is more of a counter style location - you're in and out and eating on the sidewalk, in your car, or back at your apartment. There are some tables but not many. Starting at about 1:30am there is a line out the door and down the sidewalk. The cheese fries I had on Saturday night were delicious!",

I think they have been featured too many times on the Travel Channel or the Food Network, maybe they are beginning to believe their own hype.  I enjoyed these sandwiches when I lived grew up in Pittsburgh, so I was quite eager to share this experience with my friends a few weeks ago.  They had never been to Pittsburgh, so this was going to be their first taste of a local favorite.    The food:  Bread was stale, major disappointment.  The meat was non-existant, we ordered Kielbosa, Double Egg, Angus Beef and the Pittsburgher.  I am not a salt user, ever, but I had to load on the salt to get any flavor out of my sandwich.  The portions were still decent size, but who wants cold fries, tasteless meat and stale bread.    Side Items:  The appetizers were still good, but fried food is pretty hard to mess up.  Cost:  Price was pretty reasonable, but the food was mediocre.  Ambiance - the original location is still the best, the chains are okay, but the food is lacking more so in the franchise locations.",

The menu is pretty big with a variety of options, but pretty much all of the sandwiches include a ton of dry coleslaw and french fries.

Typical Clevelander trying to navigate the burgh. Figuring that I had to at least try this Pittsburgh tradition before leaving town, I stopped by.  Service was prompt and on cue.  I ordered the cheese combo sandwich which was two slices of thick white break containing a mound of cole-slaw, large-cut fries and melted cheese.    The sandwich was ridiculously large as expected and very filling, though became kind of overwhelming after a few bites.  The taste was good, but nothing to write home about in my honest opinion.  I personally find that the large amount of coleslaw kind of overpowers the sandwich.  The bread got soggy pretty quick and became less appetizing by the minute.    Who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it?  Give it a shot if you haven't experienced it before.  Just wasn't quite for me.",

I had the capicola with cheese which was suggested by the bartender and it was real good. They use a nice thick slice chewy but soft Italian bread, good quality meat and then they pile on a french fries and a crunchy sweet and sour type coleslaw which seems to perfectly compliment the sammich. Reasonable prices and big selection in a menu you read off the wall. Glad I finally made it and was very happy with the quality.",

    "text": "Wow. Can a sandwich be any worse? During a visit to Pittsburgh, everyone we talked to said we HAD to go there. Most of us ordered the steak sandwich. Now, I wasn't expecting a Philly cheese, nor was I expecting a New York strip. I had been told what this sandwich was. So when the \"sandwich\" arrived with the gray meat product covered in soggy frozen fries and bitter slaw, I tried it they way they served it. To say it has no flavor is an insult to flavor. It was bland, nada, nothing. So a few of us tried ketchup or hot sauce. I gave up after two bites and threw mine away. It was that bad. Only saving grace for me was the cold Yuengling in my hand.   This place sucks. I had one person tell me it was an acquired taste. No, it's not. There is no taste to acquire. It's just bad late night drunk food. Maybe if it had been 1 am and I was ready to sleep in the gutter it would have been palatable.   Sorry Pittsburgh, love the town, but that's the worst  local joint I've ever been to.",

But it still lacked that thing you like in sandwiches... flavor. It wasn't extremely tasteful and the staff wasn't extremely helpful or friendly. The place was located in a nice area and had a nice steel town vibe to it. But the food was just average. I was expecting a signature sandwich to taste better.. like a New Orleans muffellata.",

You have to order the #2 most sold item. The cheesesteak. It was quite good. Really good. Why 3.5 and not a 4 or 5? One I wish it was hot, maybe it's not suppose to come out? Not totally sure. Also was a little dry. Which for a cheesesteak is kind of shocking. Though great, not over the top. Though it could have been because they were quite busy and only a couple girls on the floor. Must have been an unsuspecting rush. Which I don't care. Perhaps why the food wasn't hot. Understandable.  Service was the nice, quick and to the point.  Would I go back? Damn right I would.",

Great French bread, your choice of grilled meat, fresh cut fries, and a vinegar slaw piled high and served on waxed paper, without a plate.  The sandwich is a little light on meat, but the piles of fries and slaw really make for a beautiful pile of awesome.  The corner location with unfinished interior makes for a cool neighborhood feel, but the service (staff in general) is curt to the point of being a little rude.  Beers are all mainstream...some local taps would be nice.    Bottom line: this location has a cool old-city vibe and the food is great.",

This was a place my husband found and thought since it is a Pittsburgh institution with locations all over the city it must be good. Coming in to the bar area they sent us to the back right away since the bar is smoking and not for kids. The back not so nice. I was over it and the man got the cheesesteak for $9 and if you see the picture once he unwrapped it was like WTF? Not very large or innovative, the steak a burger like patty, sure it had fries, cheese and coleslaw (my fav part of the sandwich, tasted more sauerkraut like) but overall just not as stellar as hoped. Service is fast, atmosphere kind of dingy, not really worth the stop or the money.",

I would come here for a beer while already down here but I wouldn't come out of my way to come down here.

Sandwiches are just as good as they always are.  Beer is what you pay for.  I think their well drinks are a little overpriced.  And I miss how Primanti's used to be... before all the fried pickles and pizza and liquor... I liked the days of just sandwiches and beer.

It's honestly the only sandwich I don't feel weird about eating white bread. I think it's those thick cuts of Italian bread that seal the deal.   The only complaint I have for this location is that it's smokey. The bar next door allows smoking, but it smells like stale smoke on the restaurant side. Also, it could be cleaned up maybe a little bit inside. I guess the \"dirty\" appearance gives it some charm?? I guess?? Whatever, I'll be the one sitting at a dirty table shoving the the sammie in my mouth...",

I can say with great certainty that this sandwich was so much better than Paninis.   There are so many different sandwiches to choose from! I had the hot sausage with cheese and an egg....yum. It was in no way greasy like other big sandwiches. The coleslaw was so flavorful and falling out of the bread there was so much. Definitely filled me up.   Also it was really awesome to see a place in Pittsburgh that sold Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Seeing something familiar from your home state, especially beer, is a nice surprise.

Their is no competition and never will be any competition that can tear down Primanti bros success and deliciousness of their sandwiches. Well all of those people that I talked to, all of the people that wrote outstanding reviews, saying the sandwiches were \"majestic\" lied to me. This sandwich was an average sandwich, that personally I could have probably made one just as good or even better in my toaster oven. The sandwich was very filling of course but the flavours just did not mix together. The coleslaw was not the greatest, tasted to me very sour, the fries were alright but they put way to much on the sandwich in fact they should just leave them on the side and suggest to people to put them in or ask if they want them in. The meats in the sandwich were just regular meats, nothing special. The buns felt like a regular bun you could buy at your local grocery store. You coulda walked a couple more blocks and purchased a 12 inch cold cut combo from subway and woulda had a just as good sandwich there. Going forward this sandwich was not \"spectacular\" or \"majestic \" As many people told me, I suggest something changes, and buy some new coleslaw. Prove me wrong please, please, please prove me wrong and show me that this sandwich place is the greatest, but from my experience it was just a regular, average sandwich.",

I much rather have a media noche or a Cuban Sandwich in a cafeteria in Hialeah, FL.   The cole slaw and the fries had NO taste whatsoever. The steak and cheese? A frozen Salisbury steak not unlike anything you'd find in the frozen foods section of your local grocery store. The cheese? We still have a search party going. They can't find it.  For real, save your time, money and taste buds. Subway is a much better alternative. That is all.",

We visited the location at The Strip and it was amazing!  We went there on the first night we arrived, close to midnight.  Guy behind the counter was conservatively friendly- very Pittsburgh.  I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a meatless sandwhich but went heavy on cheese and ketchup, Heinz of course.  It was crazy good, especially when it's chased down by a Yuengling. Love the city, love the people, love the Primantis.  Bread might even be better than San Francisco's!  What?!",

    "text": "OK...let me preface this by saying I too was swayed by Adam swooning over a sandwich on Man Vs. Food...I think he nearly passed out from pleasure.  So, when my family and I found ourselves in downtown Pittsburgh, hungry as heck, passing this famous restaurant, I said \"OMG, there's that place with the fries on the sandwich!!\"  Wifey said 'why not' and son/man-child mumbled something incoherent about 'hungry'. We were seated quickly (large wood booth...we aren't the slimmest family), since the place was mostly empty.  No menu? OHHH...it's one of those places where you just look up on the chalkboard. COOL!! I had the Cheesesteak, wifey had the roast beef something or other, and my son/man-child had the kid's cheeseburger. Cokes all around.  No need to order sides of fries or coleslaw, CUZ IT COMES ON THE SANDWICH!! How cool is that?  I regaled my family with my knowledge... \"they created this sandwich so truckers could eat the thing with one hand...\"  Wifey rolled her eyes and returned to her texting, and son/man-child kept playing his Nintendo 3DS.  Hmmm...maybe I'll keep my knowledge to myself for a while.  Looked around: Cool paintings/graphics on the walls, sports icons from SteelTown, USA, etc... Long counter with your typical customers doing typical things.. Food arrives in about 15 minutes...Not bad...ready to chow down!!! Smells great!!! And... Umm...  a bunch of coleslaw slid out of my sandwich into my lap.  Wifey complained her fries were soggy as h*ll. \"should I send it back? are they supposed to soak up the coleslaw liquid?\"  ManChild ate his cheeseburger in about 3 bites and looked at me in anger, with that \"I told you I wanted to go to Taco Bell\" accusatory stare...  What can I say?  I was duped.  The sandwiches are flavorless... the fries, had they been crispy, would have been good, but they soak up the coleslaw liquid...so they are mushy.  Coleslaw has a TON of vineger, so if you don't like that style (I prefer the mayo-based) you probably won't like it.  Interesting concept, but I have no idea why this is Pittsburgh's famous sandwich.  Too bad... Adam steered me right in Philly for a cheesesteak, and in Chicago for pizza, and Detroit for a coney dog, but this was a big miss. Pittsburgh needs a new 'must have.'  Side note: I was not allowed to choose restaurants the rest of the trip.  Thanks Adam!!  :-P",

We tried to head to 3 different locations in downtown and the lines were out the door and around the corner. Luckily we found this location in a small neighborhood with locals instead of tourist.   When we walked in we got lucky as a table just opened up. We sat down and were quickly greeted for our drink orders. The server came back for our food order and then it all headed down hill. She mixed up our order with another table and told me she would bring my sandwich shortly. Well that turned in to asking her twice and waiting over 30 minutes for a sandwich. By the time I got my food everyone else was finished and I was STARVING. She also forgot our cheese fries and took forever to take the bill.   I am glad we tried this place out, but their sandwich's were not that great and the service sucked. Sorry Primanti Bro's we tried.",

    "text": "After all of the hype and a long trip from Cincinnati, I was fairly disappointed in the food. I got the Pittsburgh-er (spelling?) which apparently is the #2 best seller. My brother informed me that Yuengling or beer in general is the #1 best seller. And at the price I am not surprised! A 23 oz Yuengling was only about $2.35 or so!  We walked through the main entrance through the bar and into the back. It is interesting when people smoke in bars in other states since it is illegal in Ohio (I don't agree or disagree with it). I am glad that the restaurant portion of the place was smoke free. Bars I can deal with, but not restaurants.  The food was relatively bland, but increased dramatically when I dipped it in ketchup. I may try to get hot sauce on it next time to add some flavor. I don't really see what is so special about the sandwich. I mean, I am sure restaurants around the country have put coleslaw and french fries on top of a burger without being inspired by Primanti Bros. I favor Skyline (a Cincinnati chain) more than Primanti Bros. and I favor Hudepohl Amber Lager more than Yuengling (don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Yuengling very much). And I know you could say it is because I am from Cincinnati and my bias shows, but I will admit I loved the city of Pittsburgh when I was there.  My boss (who is from Pittsburgh) said the original Primanti Bros. in \"the Strip\" is better. I don't know if it actually is better, or if he was just saying that so that I would not dislike one of his hometown favorites. I will try the one in the Strip when I go back next time.",

There's nothing else like it in the world. And, the Carson Street location is cozy & very Southside to me (being a newb to the area).   Be sure to order it however they want to give it to you. I mean, d'you come all this way to Pittsburgh (or, if in Pittsburgh...d'you go through that hellish traffic) to say, \"please leave the fries on the side?\"   Come on now...live a little. And, really, this sandie is cheap! Man, Pittsburgh proves again it knows how to roll.

Tag words may include but are not limited to: Drunk, hungry, work men, sloppy, and a Piksburgh tradition. The fries are outstanding and fresh, as well as the Italian bread they put the sandwiches on (which is distributed from a local bakery), and the pastrami is juicy and delicious. I never really loved the coleslaw thing, and you could probably order it without, but I wouldn't suggest it... My tastebuds just never adapted to it. It's convenient. Parking is usually not hard to find, depending on which location you're at. I personally prefer the Southside location. You can always order a beer here! It's also relatively inexpensive.

Now that I think about it, that's a perfectly logical explanation for there being only a few reviews, as I'm sure most patrons of this location don't recall the exact flavors and textures of their sandwich...  Anyway, I'd heard great things about this place, so my friend and I started our night in Pittsburgh with a 22oz Yeungling and splitting the cheese steak and the pastrami. If you've read any of my previous reviews, you may notice I love pastrami sandwiches, but I must say that I was underwhelmed by the offering at Primanti Brothers. There were only two slices of pastrami! The sandwich was dominated by fries and slaw, which for me took away from the experience of a pastrami sandwich. The cheese steak was much better. The meat was sliced thick and had a great flavor, and the texture just seemed to be more balanced than the pastrami. My friend and I split each sandwich and both agreed that the cheese steak took the proverbial cake.  You don't come here for the service, but it was pretty meh. Our waitress forgot to put in our order for a side of fries, even though I reminded her twice. However, she not only brought us a side of cheese sauce for free, but she forgot to charge us! Sometimes bad service pays off. Anyway, we were out the door for about 10 bucks a pop including tip, which in my mind is a bargain for a famous sandwich and a 22oz brew. The restaurant definitely has character, so if you're looking for a late dinner/early drink on Carson, I'd recommend.",

That was my first experience with coleslaw made with vinegar. That was really weird! I have to say, the vinegar overpowered everything else. After a few bites, I had to wipe off the coleslaw. The sandwich was much better without it. The chicken breast was very good. The sweet tea was better than the tea we have in CA, but it was not as good as the sweet tea in Atlanta.

We were the only table in the place and the bartender made it quite clear that she didn't feel like coming around from behind the bar to wait on us. The bar was almost full of people drinking and not eating, and overall the place felt a lot more like a bar than it did a restaurant.  They had quite a few options on draught and I'm sure sitting at the bar would even make for a fun night.  We got two pittsburgers, a steak and cheese and a reuben.  It took a very long time for us to get our food considering we were the only table in the restaurant, and when it came out it was cold and had very clearly been sitting back in the kitchen for a long time before anyone brought it out.   My pittsburger was like a cold sausage patty--not a burger and had no taste.  The cole slaw actually tasted like chemicals.  I figured i could at least eat the french fries out of the sandwich, but they were cold and soggy.  I ended up eating only the bread from my sandwich and my boyfriend's pickle slices both of which were actually delicious. After we finished eating our sandwiches (or not eating at all in my case) we waited and waited for our check which never came, so long that i called in a pizza to our air bnb.  Finally we had to go up to the bar to actually cash out.  I waited a while to write this review because i was pretty fired up after this meal/experience, and I really don't like leaving poor reviews for restaurants unless they are totally warranted, but this was just a very bad experience.  I definitely would recommend going elsewhere in southside.",

    "text": "What looks more like a Boston pub, this corner sandwich bar sits like a gathering hole for Zeus: locals weaving stories, food fit for gods, and ladies serving with magic.   I entered and it was clear on this weekday that I was an out of towner. Lost and staring at the board, the locals bellowed \"foeget tha... Set don heer at the baar\". Immediately, a lady at the bar welcomed me with \"first time? Where you from\".   Immediately, the fun began as she spun tales of who likes what, what she likes, what not to do, and then she dropped the boom when I asked about the Cole slaw and mayo: \"no mayo here and you are doing it with our slaw. Not an option. We will swap it if you don't fall in love\". Another lady said, \" camon Chicago, we ain't lettin you not do slaw\"   So I did.  My Choices 1) Turkey and Cheese with Bacon added (server rec on bacon) --- the turkey is fresh and melts in your mouth. It is comparable to a Chicago Jewish deli  --- the bread is fresh and flavorful but meant to compliment not dominate.  --- the difference maker is the perfect ratio of cheese, slaw, tomatoes, and fries. She was right! The slaw is killer as a salt and vinegar. With the fries piled high on there, yes that is part of it, you can't go wrong. I was blown away --- the bacon was delicious and a great addition. She said an egg is the killer topper and I should have added it 2) Cheese Sandwich with egg added (server rec on egg) --- same as above but the cheese blend of four works perfectly. I would have liked it melted more but this isn't a grilled cheese.  --- wouldn't get this again not because it wasn't delicious but it isn't comparable to what is possible with the others --- PERFECT for kids!!! One and split --- egg was a definite quality addition done medium without asking   Others I didn't get anything else as that was more than enough. I ate 1/2 of each. Locals said brisket or hot sausage are the stuff!  Tips 1) listen to them! 2) keep slaw 3) if you are new, tell them and then listen to them!  The conversations, stories, and food will bring me back. They took me under their wings and spent well over an hour spinning with me. Pirates vs Cubs, Pitt vs ND, pirates vs Cubs, food, fitness, and food.  And then, they brought me free doughnuts from next door! Awesome place and spirit!  Go there. Live amongst the gods!!!",

I almost always order the Capicola and cheese.  If I've had a few drinks, and it is past midnight and I find my way to Primanti Brothers I usually will order it with an egg on it.  But the older I get I find myself there at much more reasonable times!  They claim that they are \"Almost Famous\".  I'm here to say that Primanti Brothers IS FAMOUS.  I mean, come on, Sophia Vegara just tweeted a photo of her Primanti's sandwich to her million + followers.  Primanti's has been on the Food Network God knows how many times.  Drop the \"Almost\", Primanti's, because you Are Famous.  The original location is in the Strip District but you can find one almost everywhere now.  Oakland and the South Side are probably closest to the \"authentic Primanti's\" atmosphere other than the original location, while the newer franchised Primanti's in locations like Monroeville or Harmar are much more of a restaurant type experience.  I like my floors greasy and my sandwich with fries and slaw.",

There are a lot of places to check out around the area and Primanti's is the perfect place to start you bar crawl with a tasty sandwich! Regardless of what you get, it is coming with Coleslaw, Tomato and fries. If you don't like that then it's best to know their lingo.  For example, if you don't want the coleslaw, order your sandwich with no grass. If you you just say no coleslaw you might get some strange looks. Luckily I like it all!  I've worked my way through most of the sandwiches and the Capicola and Cheese w/ Egg is my favorite but this time I tried on of their limited sandwiches called the When Pigs Fly. It had a huge pile of Ham and Bacon with Egg along with the other usual suspects. Excellent with some hot sauce added!  We also shared a order of the Loaded Nachos which were top notch!  You really can't go wrong here. Get an Iron City beer to go with your meal and you will be sitting pretty.  I will say this location is one of the smaller ones so seating is limited but we had no problem on a Friday night around 7:30p. The staff here were friendly and attentive so that coupled with excellent food is a win-win in my book!",

We were able to sit at a table in the back and received table service from there.  It's been about 10 years since I've had Primanti Brothers and it's just as good as I remembered. I ordered the Pitts-burger. Great combination for a sandwich: super soft bread, vinegary cole slaw that provided a little crunch, salt from fresh cut french french fries and a little sweetness from tomatoes to balance everything out.  In and out in about 30 minutes and left very satisfied. I would recommend this location  if the downtown locations are busy and you don't want an excessive wait outside. They also have good drink and food specials during football season.",

I've waited a week to post this just to make sure I actually felt the same way.   Firstly, and I won't dive too far in to this end of the story, trying to excuse a manager placing his hands on an employee in any way as a \"management style\" is absolutely ridiculous. I have half a mind some days to return to that location and use my \"management style.\"  Following this incident I still tried going to Primanti Bros to enjoy a Penguins game. Ya know, because, Permannys has good game specials and is a great place to watch the game. Negative. The SOUTHSIDE, yes SOUTHSIDE location was empty. It was weird to me that there was no one there. I've watched many games there before and it was never empty. Soon after speaking to the bartender/server (who never told us her name, even when I asked she just walked away, so I'll just call her the hideously mannered strawberry blond) I completely understood. I asked the beer special, she didn't know, I asked if the Penguins game could be put on, she didn't know, I asked for spicy mustard with my sandwich, she assured me you didn't serve spicy mustard but then came out with it and made sure she threw it on the table to let me know she felt like an idiot.   Man it was such a pleasant experience. I can't wait to go back! Or I'll just go to an Applebee's or Buffalo Wild Wings for the same, typical bullshit, corporate environment. It was one thing to expand to the suburbs and create the big restaurant but why would you turn the \"legacy\" stores into these spit shined shit shows? So with that, thank you Primantis for absolutely ruining a part of Pittsburgh, neigh, a part of my life and becoming the same \"sports bar\" in every mall shopping center. Next time I can at least go to a TGI Fridays and know that the Pens game will be on at the bar.",

I can say it was this for sure because that day before I truly didn't have anything to eat and the morning off only some fruit which is why I went all out. Never again though. Terrible post meal experience. Whole day of vomiting, coming out both ends, and even shaking. Took my temperature and I had no fever which leads to me only believe I had gotten food poising. Used to love Primanti' just watch at this location I guess. I know can not eat the same meal again, forever will associate how ill I was with this establishment, and I'm talking the total next day ruined!",

This location is the most authentic to the original Primantis. It's kindof divey & not overly corporate like the ones outside of the city. Quick service, same taste as always. This is a casual setting where you can grab a quick bite, or bring your friends to hang out for a couple beers, and load up on carbs.",

I got a massive grilled chicken sammich that came packed with French fries! It would have been better if it was a little warmer but the waitress apologized that multiple people called or of work that day so I understood. The beer selection was good as well with A variety of local brews. I'm glad I came here bc everyone said u can't go to Pittsburgh without trying this sand which joint. I hope to come back maybe try a different location and give a much better review. But to me it was just average for now.",

All in all I'd have to go back and try something else but judging from my first experience I'd say I don't hunk I'm going to be impressed.  A buddy of mine got the wings and he felt that they were pretty good so it's possible other food items are good.  The hospitality was really good.",

Plus it's dairy free.   - I've been inside of the Primanti Bros in Oakland and this location has that one beat as far as the space and the atmosphere goes.

    "text": "Primanti bros sandwiches are, if nothing else, a Pittsburgh thing that I can get behind.  If nothing else, this divey spot on Carson street will provide you cheap beer and a full belly so that you can enjoy the rest of your night.  Service is a little suspect, but the friendly faces, cheap food and beer and decent sports bar atmosphere are worth the trip.  Pros:  The Sandwiches are enjoyable.  I don't think it's an everyday item, but ultimately, what is the real difference between this and your corner deli which gives you the same sandwich and sides of slaw and fries on the side (\"nothing\" is the answer).  I had the Pastrami and cole slaw which was warm and filling.  We also had sides of cheese fries and fried pickles which were enjoyable standard bar fare.  Nothing special, but a welcome meal.  All the pictures do a more than admirable job of describing the sandwich - they're quite good!  The beers selection was unspecial, but the 23 oz pours at a small price (I don't recall, but it must have been under 5 dollars) make it worth it to watch a ball game.  Specifically, the IC lights were flowing!  Cons:  It's certainly a divey sports bar with slightly sticky tables and questionable AC (or a very hot weekend).  There were regular tables in a lofted secondary area, but there were basically no TV views from there (weird), but we easily grabbed a high top before the bar was mobbed by some sort of sausage-fest of dude-bro-guys.  That leads to...  Service was stilted and perhaps the plan of training an additional bartender/server on a Friday night was a bad idea.  The poor FOH manager/head-bartender/server was juggling several tables and half the bar while training a new server.  We felt bad and she was very apologetic, so I blame management more than her, but we frequently had empty cups.  However, the food came quickly!  Conclusion:  It's not trying to be more that is and even with slower service, the decent (and filling!) food and cheap beer make up for it.  Primanti's is a divey spot that does the work without being an uppity landmark-like location that other City's have.  We'll be back the next time we're in town!",

Very attentive and gave us good recommendations. She even brought out some t-shirts for us to look at as souvenirs.  Patrons were very friendly as well. My boyfriend had a roast beef and cheese and I had a turkey and cheese. Absolutely delicious!!",

I had the kielbasa and cheese sandwich, and by the time I got to sit down and enjoy it probably 30 minutes had passed. The kielbasa was good, the coleslaw seemed good, but overall the sandwich as a whole did not live up to the hype. The French fries weren't anything special, and they honestly didn't seem to add anything positive to the sandwich. I had some cheese fries too, which were soggy and the cheese had practically no flavor.   It's possible I'd enjoy the food more if it were fresh, but I don't think I was impressed enough to return the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "During my time in Pittsburgh, I couldn't go without stopping by Primanti Bros. to see what all the hype was about. At least at this location, it seems like more of a sports bar than sandwich joint, which makes sense considering beer is the \"#1 best seller\". They had plenty of drink options and some interesting concoctions that sounded tasty. But I came here for the \"Almost Famous\" sandwiches.  I went with the Pitts-Burger & Cheese, considering it's the \"#2 best seller\". I really wanted to love this sandwich and I was so excited to try it. It definitely looked like a monster. But after I took a few bites I was really disappointed. I'm not a coleslaw fan, but I just could not get past this stuff. The bitter taste dominated the sandwich. I tried a few bites without the slaw but was still unimpressed. The meat had very little flavor, the fries just added starchiness, and the cheese was unnoticeable.  Despite great service and a fun and welcoming environment, I was disappointed in Primanti Bros. I definitely respect their uniqueness and don't knock anyone for raving about the sandwiches; it's just not for me.",

    "text": "With all the hype I'd heard about this place, naturally I was curious to go to one at least once while in Pittsburgh. And from what I saw on their website, the closest one I could find was near Indianapolis. So decided to give it a try, on the first day of a 2 day trip I did to Pittsburgh last month.  Got the Capicola(spicy Italian ham) and Cheese sandwich to go(as I was staying at a nearby Holiday Inn Express), and to me there was something about the cole slaw and vinaigrette in the sandwich that unfortunately I didn't care about. I think it was more the vinaigrette that overwhelmed the sandwich, and made me not care for it. And thought there'd be a little more interesting taste to it, overall. It seems to be all white bread only on their sandwiches, and I wish you could get other types of bread as well such as wheat bread.  Glad I did try a sandwich at least once from Primanti Bros., but am not sure this place is for me. I'll give them this, that their drink specials at least looked nice from what I saw. I just wish I liked their sandwiches more, but ah well. Maybe one day I'll give them another shot, but I'm in no hurry to go back.",

Although I can't say it was too creative (it was basically just like taking everything on your plate and putting in between bread), but it wasn't bad. Not the best thing I've ever tasted, far from it, but wasn't bad.  The place had a rough-around-the-edges feel, which I think was perfect because I see Pittsburgh as that kind of city.

I lived in the 'burgh for about three years, and have had it before (from the dahn-tahn location) but my friend hadn't.  We came in at 1pm on a Sunday, certainly not busy at all. We sat at a table by the bar for about 15 minutes being ignored until we got fed up and sat at the bar instead.   My friend and I ordered a sandwich each and I asked for no cole slaw. Seeing as how I'm pretty sure that these sandwiches are not pre-made, I didn't think it was a big deal. The waitress stared blankly at the ceiling and replied \"I'll see what I can do.\" Eventually, our food got there and it was okay, not the greatness I had built up to my friend.  It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to bring the tab after asking for it (I almost thought about committing my first dine and ditch out of mercy). We had to flag down a different waitress to take our money. For the first time in my life, I left no tip.",

Come to Binghamton for spiedies or Jersey for a ripper, potatoes and peppers in a b read pocket. There are others around the country - all regional and either adored or misunderstood by locals.

Got a beer, made a decision, waited 10 minutes to order. Placed my order for a double egg and side of fries. Food came out quickly. Fries were cold and soggy. Sandwich was horrible. In part bc it was not what I expected. I took one bite and pushed it away. Bartender never asked how I was doing,could she get me anything. I finally out my credit card out for payment. She processed it and then asked if I'd like a box. I laughed out loud, said \"no\" and left.",

The Pitts-burger was amazeballs! I was told that it was better with eggs included but I actually prefer it sans eggs.  I tried the Capicola & Cheese as well which was also pretty good but the Pitts-burger was just remarkably delicious!",

    "text": "After seeing Primanti Bros on Man versus Food, I had to go there. Driving through Pittsburgh with a broken Tom Tom GPS system I eventually got to Primanti Bros a long time after I had set out.  First impressions are that the restaurant is run down and needs a refurb. The staff are friendly, large screen tv in the back where I can only imagine is on 24/7 with the local sport. Bathrooms could be cleaner, the physical appearance needs work.  Now, down to the real part. I ordered the Black Angus Steak sandwich which an extra side of fries. The fries are tasty, amazing when covered in salt and vinegar but thats only the padding around the main reason you go to Primantis. If you are going there, you are going to taste their sandwiches.  The bread is so soft and fresh it makes the sandwich taste so much better than most sandwichs you will ever eat. The sandwich is piled high with fries, coleslaw and Angus steak. Whats not to like?  For $6.79 this is one of the best sandwishes you will ever get. Compare that to Hannahs Bretzel in downtown Chicago where you pay $10 for an average sandwich and you know you are onto a winner with Primantis.  If in Pittsburgh, go to Priumanti Bros.",

So I was soo looking forward to the meal.  It took 45 minutes to get the sandwiches, the server screwed up everyone's order and wasn't apologetic when they forget to serve us our fries. I had the Pastrami and Cheese and my wife had the pittsburgher cheese steak. Not a fan of the slaw in the sandwich and our whole table (4 of us) wished we ate somewhere else. I would of rated higher if the service wasn't as bad. But overall not a memorable sandwich and will not recommend to others. Sorry Everyone!",

We showed up as happy hour was about to start and settled in with some of the locals. Great conversations, fantastic service, and plenty of great advice. I got the bacon sandwich with an egg added to it and enjoyed it. Nothing special, but a good intro to the Primanti Bros concept of putting fries and cole slaw on everything. Also had an order of the street fries which I believe had chili, cheese, bacon, sour cream, and jalapenos. Very tasty!  We added on some slices of pizza and we're not disappointed. After hitting so e other bars we stopped back by for some late night slices. Great happy hour specials.",

For those who are interested, I'll give you my impression of the sandwich.  The sandwiches are okay.  It's the experience of eating a sandwich that has fries and slaw on it that's cool.  If you were to remove the fries (like most people are forced to do given it's size), you have a sandwich that's pretty average.  I had the pastrami and cheese.  Not a whole lot of meat means the flavor of even this spicier selection was overwhelmed by the taste of potatoes.  The slaw adds a nice crunchy bite.  The bread is totally forgettable.  It adds no flavor or texture of its own and is there merely to hold the contents together.  This location is not great for lunch.  It shares space with a much larger cigar bar that relegates the lunch area to a cramped space in the rear.  Go downtown to the one on Market Sq or the original in the Strip District to get the full experience.",

Mommy?    Mistake #1:  I made and ass out of umed.   I figured the \"Cheese Steak\" sandwich was just a cool shortened title for the almighty Philly.  I thought it was odd how I said, \"I'll have the Philly\" and the bartender said, \"The Cheese Steak?\"  and actually waited for me to confirm.   My friend and I both got the Cheese Steak sandwich.  The price was right and you'd think if it's the \"#2 best seller\" you can't go wrong.  Therein lies...  Mistake #2:  Bestsellers are not always the best tasting.   Or maybe the gap between #1 and #2 is just really big.  After the first few bites, I felt like an idiot.  The only thing in the sandwich that had any real flavor was the cole slaw, and even that was so-so.  The meat was a flavorless beef patty, and the texture was disappointing.  Like microwaved leftovers.  I had to drowned the thing in hot sauce to finish it.  I love the concept, I really wanted to like my food.  In fact, I acted like I was enjoying it.  It wasn't until later that day that I expressed my disappointment to my friend.  He was quick to agree.  It sat heavy in my stomach for the rest of the day.  And not in a good way.  We had one day in Pittsburgh.  I did see other great looking eats on Yelp, but we played it safe.  I don't regret it.  And if I had a few weeks there, I'd probably give 'em a second chance.  Maybe someday.",

For less than $8 (including tax and tip), I tried the classic sandwich, which is beef (cut like you would for cheesesteak), fries, and coleslaw all in one sandwich. Aside from the flavor of the coleslaw, the sandwich was tasteless. The fries weren't seasoned, the coleslaw was good, and the meat was bland. Coming from Texas, I do expect beef to be somewhat salted and peppered. In addition, the normal grocery store bread couldn't hold the sandwich altogether, so as you ate, the sandwich fell apart. Although the sandwich was ready in less than five minutes (guess it's not cooked to order), I won't return!",

I dig the tradition, that they are the local food of Pittsburgh (aka my city away from my city), I get that surly is the attitude the wait staff is supposed to have, I totally get it, and as I said I dig it.  I am not sure the people at this location get it however.  Miserable is the only word I would use to describe the staff.  There were maybe 10 tables packed waiting for food, and the staff must've thought that meant it was ok to take 45 minutes to make our sandwiches.    In 45 minutes I literally could've gone in the back, made them, brought them out, ate them, and then perhaps got 2nds.    Also when the waitress brought our food out, she was holding the sandwiches in a stack against her shirt, so all our food was getting all over her, and she didn't seem to care.  I guess a tray would've been too easy.  It also feels as if this location is more bar than restaurant, which is cool, and also what Carson St is mostly about anyways, so it should fit in.  Just don't call it Primanti's then.  And when the OG in the strip has a line around the corner, and I am with a couple of people who haven't had a Primanti's and want to experience it for the 1st time, this is the nearest option, their reactions said it all... \"Never again.\"    And I totally get that as well.  Check the original in the strip, if it is super packed, skip it and save it for another time.  This place will ruin it for you.  Plenty of other places in the Burgh to eat and eat well at.",

I couldn't stop bite after bite even though I was full after eating the first half. The bread doesn't hold up too well toward the end but who cares? It's the insides that count, not the bread! The bread is just the vessel to get to your mouth so if it comes to it, just use your hands!  In the back room, the set up is to order at the counter and then pay later after you've eaten. They'll bring it to your table once you've found a seat and collect payment. If you wanted booze (as my friend did), he went to the front bar, ordered his beer and then came back with it. Otherwise, for sodas or water or whatever, you could order it at the regular counter and they'll give it to you. It seemed a bit disorganized but somehow it all worked. Others have complained about the service but really what do you expect? This is not exactly fine dining. You get your food, they get their money and everyone is happy...and fatter.   Primanti Bros. is the must-do for any out-of-towner or guest and you should not make fun of them if they happen to misprounce \"Primanti\".

I know Primanti Brothers is a chain, but it's still great and there's definitely a reason it's so well-known. The \"unique\" concept of the French fries INSIDE the sandwich is pretty cool - It supposedly originated because they used to sell their sandwiches to a lot of truckers (again, we're eating at a \"trucker venue,\" see: \"JoJo's\") who could only use one hand to eat as they drove. Most people would be repulsed at the concept, but it all actually works pretty well together.  The South Side location is convenient to get to, but it was a bit grimy and unkempt. The service, however, was friendly and the prices are awesome - Something like $9 for a big, fresh sandwich. I chose the sandwich with roast chicken (which also has fries, lettuce and tomato between the Italian bread slices) and it was great... Satisfying and definitely something different. They have lots of choices (I think the one with eggs is the most popular), so there's certainly something for whatever suits your mood. The wait for our food wasn't long and there are a scattering of tables and chairs to eat at, though it seems a lot of people take it to go. This is definitely another \"unique\" Pittsburgh experience and one worth seeking out. Since it's a chain in the area, you've got your choices of locations too.",

And hey, the cheese-steak really isn't bad for what it is, and pretty unique with the slaw on! Though you may need to douse it with hot sauce or ketchup for extra flavor!",

    "text": "This place was good and was what I was expecting for a Pittsburgh food staple. I had the burger sandwich which was the #2 best selling sandwich. The coleslaw was tangy and the fries tasted good. This particular location had primarily sandwiches and a full bar. The other main location has more of an extensive menu. Not a bad place to grab a sandwich for a not so expensive price to start off a night of bar hoping.",
