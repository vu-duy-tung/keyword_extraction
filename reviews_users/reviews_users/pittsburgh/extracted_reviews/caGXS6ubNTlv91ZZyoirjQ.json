I drive to the store and notice they are busier than usual. I try to get one of the employees' attention but they ignore me. After waiting 10 minutes I ask to pick up my order and the guy says it will be 30 minutes sorry and walks away. I come back to the store 20 minutes later and ask if my order is ready yet and they scramble around and say here's your online order. The bag was greasy, cold and when I got home I saw did not add the extra meat. If you want primanti's my advice is to go to a different location with better service.",

    "text": "Primanti Brothers, though iconic, doesn't live up to its widespread popularity. While Primanti's sandwiches are acceptable, they're certainly not the best in Pittsburgh, let alone Oakland.  Primanti's take on cole slaw acts as the unsung hero of the sandwich. Rather than the traditional, mayonnaise heavy, leaden version of the stuff Primanti's delicately flavors their cabbage with vinegar, herbs, and black pepper. The result is sweet, tangy, fresh, and crisp. The sandwiches warrant a taste for the fabulous cole slaw alone. That being said, it does not complement many of the meats on the menu particularly well, so make sure you order a meat that offers a salty or spicy contrast to the tangy slaw. These include corned beef, pastrami, kielbasa, fish, and capicola. The more mildly flavored meats fail to meet the sandwich's potential.  The better known gimmick of course with Primanti's is the fries on the sandwiches, which makes their product instantly recognizable. Unfortunately, the fries are often improperly cooked and tragically underseasoned, so it's more like you're eating soggy, bland, boiled spuds rather than crisp, flavorful fries. I do appreciate the handcut slices of Italian bread, but the stuff has little character outside a crisp crust. It really serves no other purpose than holding everything together (which it surprisingly does well) but I like my bread with flavor.  All told, while Primanti's is a Pittsburgh icon, the sandwich fails to excel in most ways. Try it once for the cole slaw, then go elsewhere.",

I first thought eating everything on one sandwich was insane. Boy was I wrong...it was delicious and not greasy like I was expecting. It's a sandwich you buy for the whole day...For me it was lunch dinner and some for the next day! So if you ever are in Pittsburgh stop by and have something good...for now and later!",

    "text": "Would a stop in Pittsburgh really be a stop in Pittsburgh if I didn't stop into Primanti Brothers to have a sandwich?  Absolutely NOT.  I swear, we landed, checked into the hotel, and then immediately went to the first Primanti Brothers we saw and ordered their #1 and #2 best sellers.  #2 is their cheesesteak and #1, very appropriately so, is BEER.    This particular location is quite spacious.  You can sit downstairs, you can sit at the counter and watch them make their famous sandwiches, or you can sit upstairs.  The waiters are really cool and so nice.  I could tell I was no longer in New York any more.  I ordered the #2, which is their philly cheese steak sandwich.  Unlike a traditional cheese steak, this one comes in the form of a patty, and in True Primanti form, it came loaded with french fries, coleslaw ( which is made without mayo, just salt, pepper, and vinegar), and tomatoes, crushed between two pieces of thick italian bread.    We also ordered their chili fries, which was smothered with chili sauce, bacon, and cheese and topped with two ice cream sized dollops of sour cream.   The sandwich lived up to its name.  I ate almost all of it, except for a handful of fries, but that is only because I ate so much of the chili fries beforehand.  It was a really cool experience and I can now rest in peace because I finally tried this sandwich that has been advertised and taunting me on the Food Network for so long.  I came, I conquered the Primanti Sandwich.  It was a proud moment in my life.",

I usually go here with a couple of guys and order a beer and a sweet sausage sandwich with bacon, egg and some extra cheese.  The coleslaw is sweet and has the perfect amount of vinegar.  The fries are that great kinda crunchy, kinda moist feel and the bread is a perfect cloud of lightness.  I prefer sweet sausage or kielbasa but everyone has their own preference.  I sometimes get a side of fries to go along with the meal and share it with the guys.  The guys that work here are awesome and care about people having a great experience.  Definitely get some quality sandwich here.  (Also, you should not be altering and substituting items on this sandwich, no fries or slaw on the side!!! Get it as is!!!)",

    "text": "The build up to eating at Primanti Brothers was huge. When I mentioned Pittsburgh, I would invariably get the question of whether or not I was eating there. So, what a let down when I finally did. Honestly, what is the big deal about the sandwiches?   This Primanti Brother's location is basically a bar that serves sandwiches to over-sexed University of Pitt coeds, that get drunk and loudly discuss their latest failures with men for all to hear. The music is very loud, the patrons drunk and yelling, so don't expect to have much of a conversation with your dining companions. You'll be too busy trying to fit an unnecessarily large sandwich in your mouth.  I got what their menu said was the #2 most requested Primanti Brother's sandwich, that one might think is the best they have to offer, but what I got was a some kind of meat patty with undercooked fries, cole slaw and tomato between two pieces of italian bread. It was a tasteless mess. No favor at all, except for the vinegar taste in the cole slaw.   I know Pittsburgh has flavor, because I found it at Aiello's Pizza (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/aiellos-pizza-pittsburgh\">yelp.com/biz/aiellos-piz...</a>).",

    "text": "As a Pittsburgh institution, it is unfortunate that the food here is just OK.  The sandwich composition is excellent in concept, a bit flawed in practice.  The bread is a pretty plain italian that gets soggy quickly, lacks flavor, and will quickly disintegrate when you try to man handle the massive sandwich into your mouth.  The fries while plentiful seem somewhat undercooked, soggy, and are always painfully under seasoned, which results in a huge dead mass in the center of the sandwich that doesn't add flavor or texture.  I've had a few different selections of meats, and they are almost always overcooked. The cole slaw is pretty yummy and probably the best part of the whole thing because of the vinegary snap that it gives.  You could definitely execute this sandwich much better yourself than they do here.",

My husband had never experienced Primanti's style sandwiches before and it was a real treat to watch him when our sandwiches arrived.

Ordered the recommended pastrami sandwich complete with fries and coleslaw. The bread was delicious but that's where it ended. The fries and coleslaw totally overpowered the pastrami, so much so that I dismantled it and ate the aforementioned components separately. Fries were good but since the place is literally a 10 second walk from the O, considered to have the best fries in the world, I was disappointed. Coleslaw was unremarkable which brings us to the pastrami. Mind you, I was weened on pastrami from several of NYC's best delis so my bar is set fairly high. But even if it wasn't, theirs tasted like shoe leather and I could barely bite through it.  Service was, however, awesome. I just wish I wasn't so disappointed in the food. Maybe when I visit my son in Pittsburgh again I will give them another whirl. But for now, a shake of the head and a sigh. Disappointed.",

I agree with what many have pointed out that sandwiches have 50 percent coleslaw. The only thing we really liked were the smallman street fries that come with chili, cheese, bacon and sour cream. My brothers ordered the pastrami and they said they've had better even and fast food hamburger chains. My Pitts-Burgher  May look good but don't let the looks fool you.",

    "text": "Sorry but I really don't get all the hype.  I used to live in Philly and now there's a place that knows how to do a sandwich. I still haven't found anything comparable in Pittsburgh, and Primanti's was definitely a disappointment after all the hype.  I've unfortunately been here a few times since guests who visit want to go after hearing the hype, despite my warnings and protests, and each time it continues to disappoint.  At least they now serve beer, which helps somewhat. And the staff have always been friendly.  Now I get that the fries and coleslaw on a sandwich is a Pittsburgh thing, but it simply isn't good.  And do you have to make EVERY SINGLE SANDWICH that way? Is there no room for creativity?  Can't it just be a Pittsburghy add-on option for those interested? Also, I tried asking for my fries and coleslaw on the side the first time I went and was told that it was not the Pittsburgh way and that it could not be done.  And the fries aren't even that good.  They are rather soggy and flavorless, though I did really enjoy the coleslaw.  More importantly, the meats are pretty dry and flavorless and they are all served on this overly thick dry soft white bread that doesn't seem to have a toasting or heating option, which would make their sandwiches so much better.  I know it's supposedly homemade but I think the bread is just gross. How about some french or italian rolls?  Oh and don't ever order the cheesesteak and expect it to be anything like a Philly steak.  It's disgusting and an abomination to call itself a cheesesteak.  I was going to try their breakfast sandwiches sometime thinking maybe those might be different, but then I found out they don't open until 10am.  Why have breakfast and not open until 10am?  Then I saw on here that they put coleslaw and fries even on their breakfast sandwiches, so I give up.  Also, the seating area tends to get cramped and dirty, especially at busy times.  They didn't really seem to clean the tables that frequently after other people left.  And the sandwiches seem overpriced for what they are.  I just don't get why this is considered a Pittsburgh staple when there's such better food in this town.  I'm only giving this two stars because the staff were friendly and helpful and service is quick.",

On a positive note the staff was amazing and so was the atmosphere.",

It's a sandwich for a quick bite.  On that count it's awesome.  It's a meal all combined into one: entree and sides put together.  Every sandwich has coleslaw in it (which some kids might not like) but it isn't the coleslaw you're used to. It's made with oil not mayonnaise so it tastes pretty good. Had the Pastrami Sandwich and it was good.  You can taste the fries first then the meat and finally some coleslaw flavor.    Waiter was excellent and attentive. Patient with our bunch which was made up of 5 kiddos. He never made us feel like we had to hurry or anything, which was nice.  Cook even came up to see how we were doing and how food was, nice touch.    If your looking for a quick bite, this is THE place.",

It has a weird old meat taste and the texture doesn't even resemble burger meat. I ate two bites, took out the meat and ate the bread and coleslaw. Unsure of how the menu claims its the #2 seller.

    "text": "Disclaimer: Despite the one star review, I think everyone needs to try this sandwich at least once in their life, as its somewhat of an iconic Pittsburgh schtick.  With that said, once is probably enough.  Primanti's is famous because they famously pile fries and coleslaw into their sandwiches.  This traces back to the days of the steel workers, who had no easy way of eating/packing the coleslaw and fries, so what easier way to consume it than to stuff it into the sandwich.  I'd recommend the capicola and egg once you decide to make the plunge and pop your primanti's cherry.  The fries can be kind of soggy, but like I said, it's worth trying once.  I'd also recommend splitting the sandwich with someone else, if possible- it was definitely too much food and not worth saving for later.",

Turned out my hotel was a few blocks from this location and it was open till midnight, so as fate would have it, I gorged.  I didn't want to mess up my one and only shot to get Primanti Bros, so I wavered and asked the employee what I should get since I was debating between the corned beef or pastrami. AHA! There was a corned beef/pastrami combo. DONE.  I really enjoyed my sandwich. Meaty, carby, cheesy, crunchy, delicious. The meat was nice and tender, the russian dressing was a classic addition, the fries were fresh and hot. It was all really good. Was it the best pastrami/corned beef, I've ever had in my life? Not quite, but it is damn good. I'd definitely go back.  I even ran back to my hotel at 11:30pm so I could hurry up and eat it and it was still good.

I've debated the merits of primanti's with my friend, Eric (pretty much the most magnificent person in all of pittsburgh (if not the world)). But, not even Eric's dulcet tones could voice a convincing argument for primanti bros. \"Uhhh, well, primanti bros was featured in a national geographic issue\" -- yeah, and that's why the national geographic should just stick to covering animals and shit.   Bottom line: Unless you're a fan of soggy fries with mounds of cole slaw served on dry crumbling bread, primanti bros will only lead to disappointment.",

The cook was standing there looking at his phone and didn't greet us until we said something(all the while still looking at his phone).  I decided to get the corned beef sandwich since it was recommended to me by some people.  Easy on the coleslaw and fries.  I also tried their chili.  Even being easy on the coleslaw and fries, it was a pretty big sandwich.  The fries and coleslaw definitely overshadowed the corned beef.  The sandwich was decent but definitely not amazing as some reviews would say.  The fries could have been cooked a little bit longer imo.  Update: I didn't want to do a complete update as I only went back for the \"almost famous chili\" the 2nd time around.  I have to say they totally butchered the chili.  It's probably \"almost famous\" for being the worst made chili ever. It was practically tomato soup with onions.  VERY little beans and beef.  I wouldn't even call this chili.  Sorry but if a fast food joint like Wendy's can make better and heartier chili than this place, something is wrong.  The only thing they got right was the bread and butter.    This place is just a novelty eats imo.",

He looked up at the menu again, then took my partner's order.  Behind the counter, I noticed him chattering a bit with his co-workers, again looking up at the menu. After a few minutes, he returned to my table and said to me \"I'm sorry... what did you say you wanted?\" \"A fish sandwich\", I replied. \"Oh, it's just that no one really ever orders those...\" Great, I was sure this sandwich is going to turn out awesome.  About ten minutes later, our sandwiches arrived. All fine and dandy, except my friend did not order a sandwich. She ordered garbage fries or some facsimile thereof. He apologized for the mistake, looked understandably embarassed and returned with her correct order a few minutes later.  Now these garbage fries... they were a sight to be hold. More like fry soup. The paper boat was literally sopping with liquid, and I'm surprised it didn't capsize in its own goop. The cheese was more like campbells cheese soup from a can, completely liquid, and drowning the doomed french fries. Not only could this cheese/fry mixture have easily been mistaken for a college culinary experiment gone horribly wrong, it was also bland as hell. Some things are ugly but taste great, and this was not one of them. Equally disappointing was the fact that the \"bacon\" was in fact \"bacon bits\", fake and salty little pink crumbs of preservatives.  After expressing distaste for our experience to a different waitress, and pointing at our uneaten fry/soup-boat, we were only met with \"Oh, whats wrong with it?\", and not a single mention of a refund.  Don't get me wrong, I've been here before and ordered more \"commonplace\" items I guess, and they've been stellar. We just had one rotten experience, maybe yours will be better.",

I don't know of many other places in the Burgh where I can be this full for seven bucks. To top it off, their draft beer is something crazy like $2 a pint, $2.75 for a larger size. Awesome.

So why, Primanti Bros, why at 11:15 tonight were all of your stools up and your doors locked without even an explanation of why you were closed up early?  It wasn't like you were cleaning up when we got there. The floor lights were off and the manager was doing the end of the night count. Based on previous experience, I'd say you had been closed since at least 10:30, if not earlier than that.  Just as a recap: 10:30 =/= midnight.  No love,  Me  I normally hate the people who write reviews without actually eating at the restaurant, but in this case I felt entitled :\\  It gets two stars instead of one because I'm an optimistic person who hopes that maybe tonight was just a fluke or an emergency and not just a lazy staff. I might go back someday, but I probably won't bother. BLEH.  EDIT: Somebody from this area tells me that that isn't normal and tonight was probably an exception. That's pretty much what I figured, but is a sign to much to ask for?",

Why then don't I like Primanti?  I've tried a couple of versions  (pastrami, steak) and was completely uninspired.  The bread is blah, the cole slaw is nothing more that shredded cabbage and the meat is not what I would consider to be quality.  While the pastrami is certainly better than the steak (or what THEY call steak), I was not impressed.  IMO, the bread's the thing, and with Primanti, the bread is nothing more than what you get out of a supermarket.  A better sandwich would be made on a nice, crusty italian role, then doctor up that \"cole slaw\" with some vinegar, mayo or something to give it flavor, and use better quality meat and THEN you got a sandwich.    A Philly cheese steak is a much better option.",

Do make sure you catch someone's eye when you're going there for lunch, as they have an upstairs and a downstairs to serve, and, as far as i can tell, barely a handful of people at work.  It's probably a good thing we went there, hungry...

The meat might be a little hard to find beneath all these, but, not to worry... it's there, and you can still taste it. Their streetman fries are a heart attack in a basket - fries with chili, cheese, bacon, and sour cream. Don't order it as a side, unless there's quite a few in your party.

I don't really recommend the cheese-steak, bec. it's basically a hamburger patty w/ cheese on it. However, I prefer the deli meat sandwiches. And yes the coleslaw and fries come *in* the sandwich.  I actually like their coleslaw and their fries, though some people I know didn't like either.   I recommend you follow your meal w/ a chaser of Malox.",

Granted, I got cajun chicken, which I doubt is their strong suit, but I tasted my friend's pastrami and it wasn't any better.  The cole slaw is tasteless and slimy and the fries are soggy. The bread tastes stale and I don't even think it would be good if it were fresh.  Oh well. I still say you have to try it since it's such a Pittsburgh institution. And I know people who like them in the middle of the day and sober, too.",

I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was ok, not great.  The nice thing about this place is that the sandwiches are inexpensive so if one doesn't fill you up, two or three of them isn't going to cost you a whole lot.  The waiter was nice enough and refilled our drinks in a timely manner; however, I just wasn't that impressed by the sandwich.  It wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be and if I had been by myself (wife was with me), I might have ordered another one.  The fries and cole slaw are decent and they do give you a nice amount of each item.  I simply can't say that I would go back here if given the opportunity.  Maybe if you are in college and need a cheap meal, I'd say go for it.  I do think that everyone needs to try one of these sandwiches for themselves, though.  I just wasn't overly satisfied and I think I have tamed my Primanti Bros. craving for a long time.",

We walked into the restaurant and were greeted with a smoky atmosphere. This place is definitely the college go-to place for a Sammy! My boyfriend got the pitts-burger and I got the Capone. The pitts burger is this weird meatloaf-ish patty which was pretty disappointing as it was one of the most talked about sandwich. The only saving grace for the sandwich was the fact that it was stuffed with french fries and coke slaw. The Capone was wayyyyy better! Get this Sammy if you come here! I love the combo of the hot sausage with the cold cole slaw. Personally I think the fries were much and changed the texture of the sandwich. They should give you an option to have your fries on the side. Overall, fun experience but I prefer Ike's over this any day.",

The atmosphere is bar/tavern/dinner feeling and it's probably a good place to watch a sports game and pad the lining of your tummy if you're planning to have some beers/drinks with friends.    We had the Pitts-burger and the pastrami sandwich.  Each sandwich comes with cabbage/coleslaw, tomato, cheese and fries with your choice of protein smashed between two big pieces of Texas style (thick) white bread.  You can add onions or fried egg.  We choose to add a fried egg.    As with everything in Pittsburgh, the sandwich/burger was big and hearty.  And the combination of coleslaw, tomato and fries made it tasty.   That said, it's more like comfort food than a gourmet sandwich and is still bar/tavern dining. Definitely not something that i would recommend eating everyday if you're on a diet ;) or watching your vitals.   The  original off the stripe tends to have a line out the door that sometimes goes down the street, so we opted to try the one on Forbes St. near university of Pittsburgh campus.  The food is the same at their locations.  My suggestion is to skip the line and go to another location.   Net, I'm glad we ate their at least once.",

It seems obvious but their sandwiches need the slaw/fries/tomato to make them special. Bonus points for adding onion and fried egg.  I usually skip the #2 bestseller and go for the strip steak sandwich instead. A couple bucks more but a much better steak sandwich. No sides necessary as the sandwich is filling enough - at least for me.  For the tourists out there, I can't imagine most of you will \"love\" these sandwiches. It's sort of in our DNA as a Pittsburgher.  Surprisingly the pizza available at some of the suburban versions is pretty good itself. They always have some sort of beer special as well.",

    "text": "We were in town visiting schools and decided to try this place for a quick, casual dinner based on reviews. We had no trouble getting a table around 5:45pm and the service was friendly and efficient. This is basically a greasy spoon with a lot of local flavor but the food was quite good. As expected, the sandwiches were enormous, though my hungry teens had no trouble polishing them off. They're served on the table on paper, without utensils so remember to ask your waitress for a fork if you want one (upon request only). We each had the Pitts-burger (#2 Best Seller) except for one person who had the vegetarian black bean burger, which was also delicious. Fountain drinks were on the small side, but refilled quickly. All in all a good experience and no one left hungry. We'd be happy to return on our next visit.",

I wanted to eat at all the famous/iconic Pittsburgh restaurants and that of course ultimately led me to Primanti Brothers.  I ordered the burger sandwich, which they advertised as the #2 best selling sandwich.  It kind of left me wondering what was the #1 best selling since that wasn't posted.  Anyhow, it was a great sandwich.  Loved the Cole slaw and the fries mixed in with the meat.  However, the sandwich is very dry and needs a sauce or ketchup to kind of balance things out. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend stopping through if you are ever in town just to try it out.",

The place is dirty, there's no service to speak of, and my sandwich was extremely under-seasoned and bland.  They misunderstood our order, made me wait at the bar for them to take 6 orders until they agreed to fix it, and they forgot our side of fries. No apology, no \"please sit down and we'll bring it to you\", nothing. We had a roast beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. The pastrami was better, but both were bland and the fries inside were unsalted and undercooked. Would not return, and don't recommend.",

The fries were brown and burnt and the cole slaw was just cabbage and vinegar. I could make a better cole slaw than that!  My husband got the \"famous\" Pitts-burger and said it was just one slab of cheesesteak with no flavor. I felt that my sandwich also had no flavor. It was nasty. I could only take 3 bites and had to get something else for dinner, it's that bad. I do not recommend eating here, the sandwiches are nothing special!",

    "text": "How do you go to San Francisco and NOT have the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl? How do you go to Austin and NOT have barbeque of some type? How do you go to NYC and not have a slice of pizza? You dont! You have to do those things to experience how folks there chow down.       So if in Pittsburgh, you throw caution and your diet to the winds and try a Primant Bros sandwich. In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus.           Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. \"Buy this stock, its a great investment\" or \"Marry her, it'll work out\".  Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like \"eat it, you've had worse\", or  \"so what if I'm husband number five?\"   Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming \"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\" vibe going on.. Nice atmosphere, easily navigatable menu,  (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\") a good mix of beers, TV's all around the room.  This is a Pitt landmark, gotta take in the full experience (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\").        So here's the waiter ,a  fine and friendly fellow and I can hear my mouth and brain arguing. (Mouth: \"Get the number 2, I dont care, I hate this guy anyway from last nights tofu\"..  Brain: \"We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want\") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread.  The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer!       The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge  (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\"). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind.  Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a  sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich. No amount of ketchup could save it..   (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\")   I probably should have just taken it out and eaten a cole slaw/fries sandwich...  Of course while I'm eating, (well enduring is more like it) the sandwich, the next table orders the pastrami....It looked deleicious, hearty, tasteful. My one time to eat at PB's and I choose (like the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) poorly. I wont slam Primanti Bros with one star because I had alternatives and only one visit. (Note to Brain: Stand up for yourself!. Dont let the Mouth make all the decisions, he only works here, you're supposed to be running the place!..)     If in Pittsburgh again, I will try PB's again. And I will get, all togther now:  THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!",

The sandwiches they have are not really geared towards breakfast (ie lots of deli meats or fish), but we decided to give Primanti's a try. I ordered the egg sandwich, and it was decent but didn't have a whole lot of flavor, so I had to douse it in hot sauce. All sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw in the bun...the friends I was with didn't tell me this before we ordered because they didn't want me to embarrass them and ask for the fries on the side. It was an interesting combo, but I preferred to take most of the fries off of my sandwich and eat them on the side. Overall, my friends and I felt that the sandwiches were a little heavy and greasy, but they hit the spot.",

Nothing fancy, just some basic tables and an menu of the huge Pittsburgh sandwich with choice of meat/cheese and fries, coleslaw, and tomato in the sandwich.  It's huge and hard to eat but delicious and a must try if you've never been to Pittsburgh.  One nice thing about this location is that it has just been remodeled a bit everything in the kitchen area looks really clean.  Don't worry, they did not make anything fancy though, you still get that Prmanti's feeling when you walk into the place.  The manager at this location also took the time to personally great our table.  Nice touch!",

But it was something that you just did.  I'd group Primanti Brothers into the same category.  I'll ignore the sticky surfaces on the table & railing and focus my comments on the food.  My family ordered three sandwiches - pastrami, ham and hot sausage - along with the Smallman St. fries.  The food was delivered fairly quickly and we dug in.  After a few bites, we all came to the same conclusion:  the food was just OK.  My sandwich didn't have any type of flavor to elicit a reaction from my taste buds.  And even with all of the toppings, the fries weren't anything to get excited about.  We actually left the fries unfinished and chose not to take the remnants with us.  The food wasn't bad and the price was certainly reasonable.  But there wasn't anything there that would make me look forward to another visit in the near future.  Been there, done that.

    "text": "Guess I will be adding yet another \"meh\" review for this place on Yelp. I'm not really sure how to review this--it's not terrible, but I also definitely don't think it's one of those must-go places for people coming to Pittsburgh. The best word that I can think of is probably \"gimmicky.\" You hear all the raves about the place, you go in and order your Pittsburgher cheese steak loaded with coleslaw and fries, and you either go \"wow, this place is awesome\" or \"how the hell is this so famous?\"  I probably belong in the latter category. Personally, I'm not sure why these things are any special. If I really craved something like the Pittsburgher cheese steak, I could just as well go to any other cheese stake place, order fries and coleslaw on the side, and mash them all together to call it a day. That said, many people love Primanti for a feel-good, nostalgic type of experience, rather than the food itself; I'm not a native so I'm not qualified to comment on this.  In any case, the cheese steak itself is also pretty meh as a food item--meat is pretty bland, fries are soggy, and coleslaw is a bit overwhelming. Given a choice, I'd much rather eat the stuff separately at a place that makes them better. The place is also surprisingly small on the inside; there is an upper level, but the spacing between the tables on the first floor is really cramped. I guess it makes for a good atmosphere on Stiller days or late-night bar hopping.",

When I get the sandwiches, I don't like their French fries (they're soggy) but I do like their coleslaw a lot and I don't usually like coleslaw. The chili is good, a lot spicier than you would expect! Overall, even though the sandwiches are what they're known for, the wings and chili are your best bet.",

Admittedly, I'm a coleslaw snob - it's one of those things that can go so wrong so quickly - but I absolutely love it here. I would have ordered it as a side in addition to being on my sandwich if I knew was I was in for. All I ordered was a sandwich and it was definitely enough to eat for lunch. All the flavors together are what really make it though, so don't go picking the fries out and eating them separately. ;)  I subtracted a star for a couple of reasons - the child size Dr. Pepper I got was over $2 and that left a bad taste in my mouth. Plus they didn't do a great job keeping the lunch rush organized. I get the seating is first come, first serve, but I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't gone there with regulars.",

The  sandwiches were great  but loaded with extra stuff as eaten here in Pittsburgh. Huge portions and tons of calories. I was there for a business meeting with someone out of town. She loved the lunch. I though it was good and I picked the turkey and the co worker ate the black beans. Both were as expected and were served on a wax paper. They gave us bags to take home. The cost is average. The only problem was the smell of burning oil and  I assume  the ventilation. I smell fried food on my clothes for the rest of the day. I will go back for a relaxed dinner with drinks.",

    "text": "Worth a try, but in my opinion, this location was not worth the hype. It was very busy, a few seats opened up at the counter so my family and I squeezed in to place an order for carry out. We left about 25 minutes later and ate at a near by park only to discover that we were missing items!   We were charged for, but did not get the Ragin' Cajun chicken sandwich or the marinara sauce to accompany the mozzarella triangles side. We split the food up for our picnic lunch and decided to make do.   I found the meat in my pastrami sandwich to be the best part of the meal. There wasn't enough meat to make the whole thing good. The fries stuffed in the sandwich tasted more like grease then anything. They lacked flavor and texture. Maybe it was because we took the order to go, but the drive to the park was less than 10 minutes and the fries were so limp-y. I also did not like the coleslaw as much as I thought I would. There was so much of it, I scrapped some off to eat on the side. I would have liked the sandwich a lot more with seasoning on the fires, less slaw, and more meat. The signature Italian bread was good, but I would have preferred it toasted. I know, I know, maybe I should just stick to another restaurant or my own kitchen, right? Well, it's just my opinion :)  BP and my brother had the Pittsburger. The patties were a bit thin, but it tasted pretty good. BP actually liked the slaw and he usually hates coleslaw! My sister mom and dad traded pieces of the Tuna and Fish and Cheese. Tuna was good, hard to mess that up, but the Fish and Cheese was greasy and the fillets of fish were lost among the fries and slaw.   The mozzarella triangles were good, but not quite awesome because of the missing marinara. I could not wait to eat them so I ate them sauce-less. The fried pickles also ordered were not as good since the breading just slid off the pickle spears and were soggy. The sauce served with the spears was pretty good and tangy.   After we were all done eating, we went back to the restaurant to pick-up the missing Ragin' Cajun. It was ready waiting for us in a paper bag held by an apologetic waitress, which was nice.   We were pretty stuffed from eating earlier, so I am a fan of the portion size at Primanti. We split the Ragin' Cajun and everyone had a few bites. I loved how HOT the chicken was and that it was cooked well.  Primanti Bros- Oakland: Worth a try, just check your order if carrying out on a busy day!",

We were patient because the few (very few) people working were working hard. Way understaffed.   People came in after us, got drinks.  We got,  \"Be right with you.\" 5 more minutes.  Another group came in after us.  They got drinks. We got ignored.   The staff is not rude, they are highly understaffed. And it's dirty. Did I mention that already?? Sorry. Not sorry.   We left.

Many of the students on campus told me that this is the best sandwich ever too. And after trying it, I can see why college students would like it - portion size is off the charts. But it really doesn't taste like much to me.  The appetizers are pretty good though - the loaded tater tots and fries are really flavorful and hot out of the fryer. The fried cheese triangles are really good too if you like fried gobs of mozzarella (and let's be honest, who doesn't?).  But the sandwich? It's an experience to be sure as its a Pittsburgh icon but I think its a one and done thing. Bread is soft italian bread but so soft that it can't hold up to the mass of stuff inside. I got a capicola and egg and the meat was a pretty good amount, but it still dwarfs the contents of the fries and slaw. The slaw is pretty good actually - I don't normally like slaw either. But when you got about 3 inches of fries to go through that are a bit limp and not crisp and unsalted, its really hard to taste the sandwich from top to bottom - you just taste bland fries. A lot of our group couldn't finish their sandwich cause it was just too much for them and I can see why.",

From the moment we walked in, we knew we would like this establishment. They have plenty of televisions to watch sports while you wait for your food.  I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and it definitely did not disappoint. My friends got burgers and they liked them as well. The sandwiches are piled high with slaw and fries.

It was light and refreshing because they make it with apple cider vinegar. The wings were decent but I would highly suggest not ordering their chili fries.

    "text": "My husband and I ate here on Saturday.  after so many people had recommended them we were really disappointed. The resturant was dirty, I mean really dirty. The waiter was less than attentive. They had one guy cooking for a packed restaurant. The waitresses, who looked like they had just rolled out of bed in yoga pants and t-shirts, were constantly flipping and flinging their hair over the food preparation area. Once we got our food it was so sloppily put together we had to reassemble it only to find 2 tiny slices of tomato and a practically non-existant dollop of cheese on each side of our Pittsburger.  We decided against the slaw which appeared to be only dry cabage anyway. It was terribly dry and tastesless.  The only good thing was the mozzarella wedges that kept us from staving while we waited. I saw many of these restaurants around Pittsburgh while we were there but because this one was so nasty with less than stellar wait staff, we won't try them again when we go back. Burgatory was much better!",

    "text": "Every food show that comes to Pittsburgh focuses its lasers on Primanti Brothers. Man Vs. Food loved it! Diners, Drive-ins & Dives raved about it! Native Pittsburghers raise it to Untouchable status. In fact, it seems nearly sacrilege to live in Pittsburgh and not love Primanti Brothers.  Quite frankly, though, there isn't much to love. I've lived in Pittsburgh for three years, and everyone who visits demands a trip to Primanti Brothers. So I take them. I've been more times than I care to admit, so I feel more than qualified to bash this place.  I'ma break it down for you piece by piece.  1. The Bread: Folks love the bread! It's thickly-sliced and freshly baked! It makes the sandwich unmanageably large, though; you spend more time mashing the sandwich into a fittable size than you do actually eating it. Additionally, the bread is so thick it overpowers the meat and sticks to the roof of your mouth in a most unpleasant manner.   2. The Meat: Really bad quality. The \"steak\" is worse than Steak-ums. It's actually worse than the rubber mats that line the floor behind the bar. Saying it has flavor is a compliment. And the \"Big Fish\"? Gag. Van de Kamps. If that.   3. The Cole Slaw: Tastes like cabbage that's been soaked in vinegar. It has crunch, but that's about all it has.  4. The French Fries. Meh. Bland.   And all this is glopped together, sliced, and served, rather unceremoniously, on wax paper.   Many see this as Down n' Dirty or Good Ol' Boy style. No Frills. Truly American.   I see it as Not Much To Brag About.",

A sandwich (and a beer) always made me feel a lot better. I like mine with either capicola, turkey, corned beef, or pastrami. I'm not that picky and they're all really good. No matter what, I always get it with a fried egg on top (a must!). The fries and cole slaw, on their own, would be alright (not great). However, jammed together on the bread, with grilled meat and egg, it's out of this world. We make a healthier version at home, which is just about as good. Every time I'm back in the area, I always make a point to stop in at one of their locations.",

Now I'm not even sure it's worth the experience of being able to say you've come here.  The portions are huge and cheap, but the buck stops there.   The Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak wasn't cheesy or steaky.  The meat was more like a dried out morning sausage patty.  The \"Colossal Fish & Cheese\" sandwich was definitely colossal with a generous fried fish fillet, but the fillet had that old fishy taste... I almost prefer McDonald's Fillet-O-Fish.  The sandwiches are so big you wonder how you'll shove it all into your mouth, but when you finally manage, the flavor and texture contrast is really underwhelming despite the number of layers.  The bread is delicious and soft, the meat is so-so, the coleslaw makes everything vinegar'y, and the fries just make everything starchy in my mouth.  Alas I'm guilty of being a tourist here.  This place seems to be a more fun hang-out during game days when you're sharing a pint over the table.  Love the history of this place, not the food.  Isn't that why Beer is the #1 Seller over the Cheesesteak?",

First, it's a Pittsburgh institution, so I definitely recommend eating here if you're only in Pittsburgh for a few days.  It's unique, you get an unholy amount of food for pennies on the dollar.  In fact, for total calories per dollar, Primanti Brothers could compete in a national championship.   On the other hand, you have to tell it like it is.  The service is horrible, and when they're busy (which seems like always), you will stand in line forever.  It's pretty impersonal, although it is impressive to watch the cooks.  It's also fun to listen to the arteries clogging all around you. Just based on medical advice, I would not recommend eating here more than once in your life, but you should definitely eat here once.",

You can get a Primanti Sandwich from every corner of this city.  I would believe that if you are going to go to the one on Forbes, where they only serve their famous sandwiches, it would be a unique experience.  Actually it turned out to be a LONG experience, a lot longer than expected.  I got there around 1:30 in the afternoon, so I would assume after the lunch rush or towards the end at least.  In any case, the place was not packed, busy, but not overwhelming busy.   We were quickly seated, but it took about 20 minutes before a waitress even took our orders, and that was the easy part.    Over the next 30 minutes we waited for three Primanti sandwiches, nothing special, just with egg on all three and a couple double meat.  Finally the sandwiches arrived, no double meat.  At this point, I really didn't care because I was so hungry, so I just enjoyed the feast that was before me.  The only reason why I am not rating this place lower, after the experience, is because the waitress was nice enough to apologize and not charge out us for the double meat (which we never got) and the sandwich  was as usual, l'awesome.",

I found the sandwiches at this location to be more generous (more slaw, more fries, etc) than at the suburban shops.  Everyone in my party of five thought the same thing, and the quality was as good or better than other Primanti's I have eaten at.  Service, on the other hand, was lacking a little bit.  While the server was attentive to the point of getting our meals to us, after that we were on our own.  After waiting about 15 minutes for our check, the cook behind the counter was gladly willing to check us out when I asked.    Note that this location does not accept credit cards, and we had to use the ATM in the building lobby because the PNC ATM up the block was out of order.  Bring cash!  The quality of the food and the college-town ambiance helped ensure the 4-star rating, even though the service was a bit lackluster.",

So of course we tried it, and of course like I imagine, most people probably have it after a long night out, which we did. I have to say the best part is that they stay open late for the bar crowd to have an option of food after the long night. But that may just be the best part as all I could really taste on my sandwich was the fries. I know that is what they are known for and had heard the staff doesn't appreciate \"specialty\" orders that late, besides of course having to try the original on the first attempt, but I can't say it was for my taste having that many fries on there. If that's your thing I would certainly say this is your place or definitely say you have to try it on your first trip to Pittsburgh since it is the classic but would warn you to prepare for it. I would maybe give it another try if I were in Pitt just to see if it was that particular night/sandwich/location as it is a landmark itself but first impression was too many fries and wouldn't go out of my way for it. The place was small and the atmosphere was laid back, kind of a drinking crowd and pretty loud. We didn't eat there but it wouldn't be out of the question.",

This particular Primanti Bros was rather small & cramped, but it had a cool atmosphere to it.  We've been to one other Primanti Bros, but it was out in the suburbs of Pittsburgh somewhere, and had more of a chain restaurant (like Applebees or Red Robin) feel to it.  This one on Forbes Ave in Oakland, it had better atmosphere.  There were no plates or silverware, they served the sandwiches on wax paper.  The service was fast & they got you your food.

I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and of course, I left it as is- stacked with cole slaw and fries. The sandwich was massive! I couldn't actually take a bite into the entire thing - I had to take it apart and take it in piece by piece. When I finally got a mouth full of everything, I was surprised. It was really good! I was surprised how tender and flavorful the chicken tasted and the fries were great! It's really just like having potatoes in your sandwich. Also, the cole slaw was not bad either. The thick bread was real buttery and tasty too.  Obviously not a healthy option but I would say Primanti Brothers is definitely something one should try in Pittsburgh.",

The french fries are tasty and done well, and the cole slaw is peppery and vinegary and that's it, which I like.   It wasn't crowded for a late dinner on Monday night, and service was decent.

    "text": "I've been hearing about Primanti's for literally my entire life. My mother grew up in the Pittsburgh area, and is fond of recounting the time her aunt took her to the original location on Penn Ave. Her mother pitched a fit because back then, it was \"not a good area\". And...that's the whole story, actually. I guess you could call it more of an anecdote...  This weekend, I was in town with my parents and my brother, scouting out apartments in the city. One thing we could all agree on (a rare feat indeed): a stop at this famous spot was a must. After walking around in the steamy hot weather, our stomachs ravenously insisting on a rather-late lunch, we finally rolled into the location at Pitt around 2.30.  It was perfect. No one was there. Two of us got cheesesteaks (weirdly, they use patties instead of shaved steak), and two of us got pastrami with provolone (YES!). I've always particularly liked weird items on sandwiches, and fries and coleslaw would certainly fit that bill for some people. But really, it's an excellent combination. Their slaw isn't gloppy and heavy: it's dressed in a zesty, peppery vinaigrette, not a speck of mayo to be found (which is exactly how I like it). Their fries aren't greasy or overly salty: hot and crispy, they're a perfect complement to the cool, tangy taste of the slaw.    The prices are reasonable. Considering you get your fries IN the sandwich, and the priciest selection tops out at around $7, it's plenty of food for your buck. Plus, as my dad remarked, \"Half a sandwich is honestly plenty\". However, we did all end up stuffing down the rest, because a good sandwich is always worth the ensuing food coma.    I can guarantee I will be making a return visit.",

Often they didn't have time to eat a side of coleslaw and fries seperately so they just threw it on the sandwich. And thank God they did. A truly unique experience. Don't ask for them on the side or you'll look like a complete idiot. If the waitress doesn't refuse I will come myself and throw the fries on the sandwich. A great icon for the city of Pittsburgh and a great value",

I had looked forward to trying this sandwich for awhile and it did not live up to the hype. BLAND BLAND BLAND. Fortunately they have malt vinegar there so I could add a little flavor. Mayo helped as well. I had capicola and cheese. Everything was just tasteless from the slaw to the meat. The fries arent bad but it doesnt make a sandwich automatically good by smashing a bunch on them. I'm a big fan of the idea but this was not satisfactory. My friend had the cheese steak which was a processed cube of steak. He was also dissatisfied. The beer mightve been the best part. I was turned on to Yuengling during my visit and am not a lager fan but it is a tasty beer! The service was acceptable but we did end up there around 4:30. The thick, handcut slices of bread are pleasing but it gets served in a small basket and impossible to find the bottom of the sandwich. Very messy.   Oh and I heard them saying they had 38 loaves of bread left at about 5pm on a Fri night. They claim to be open til 2am. You do the math.   I may try a sandwich at the original location at some point in my life but my initial impression was a total letdown.",

The ad had a picture of the giant silly sandwich in front of the restaurant and of course, I had to try it.  So I brought the picture with me, had my cousin drive me around when I got off the plane and we found it!  I had the sandwich just like the picture.  We all really liked it.  Normally, I like food that's simple, you know, not trying to hard.  I've had tons of good pastrami and - like barbecue - if it's done well you don't need to dress it up much.  This sandwich, fully dressed, is a lot of fun though.  It was delicious and the restaurant's a real treat.  From an outsider's point of view, an outsider who loves local food, it's a great Pittsburgh icon.",

The Pittsburgher (cheese steak sandwich) is my personal favorite, although they recently added a new sandwich to the menu that's also really good. It's called the Polish Hill, and it's made with kielbasa, spicy mustard, sauerkraut, and pirogies instead of Primanti's classic fries. It's very different, but if you've already sampled Primanti's more iconic sandwiches, it's definitely worth a try!",

They were a bit intimidating at first sight but turned out to be the right size for a hearty meal.  Their signature sandwich includes French fries and cole slaw with onions optional at no additional charge.  The thin bread struggles to hold its hefty load and a fork and knife would have been appreciated.  Overall was very satisfied and would recommend this place at least once.",

I ordered a salad the garden salad, and I thought it would be a fresh salad it with an ice vinaigrette which is what I ordered and they brought the salad me and there was fries and craft cheese on it and they said they couldn't take off the fries because that's what they do and the fries were literally disgusting and the cheese was from craft and I'm lactose intolerant and they gave me cheese and I didn't even eat anything there. My sister got chicken tenders, and they were frozen I family got a burger and a sandwich and all of them hated it was one of the grossest things I've ever gotten and I do not recommend I'm just warning you ahead of time don't try it.

    "text": "Local dining icons deserve their own criteria for recognition.  That said, adding sliced tomato, coleslaw and a pile of fries to a deli sandwich defines the Primanti as a Pittsburgh-area institution.  Their cheesesteaks will never threaten the best of Philly's, nor will their pastrami or corned beef be mistaken for New York deli; this only serves to make the Primanti style unique.  I find their meats to be generally good, and reasonably generous.  Tomato on a corned beef sandwich can only be regarded as an acquired taste.  Personally, I'm not a fan of loading a sandwich with fries, but again, this is a matter of preference.  The assembled work is a massive sandwich which invites a machismo-driven, face-first dive into its mismatched imperfection.  After the second or third surfacing-for-air, the conclusion I've always had was of an enjoyable adventure.  Prices are downright cheap.",

The service is pretty poor at the counter, although in one visit an older man waited at our table and he was quite good.  The portions are generous, the sandwich bread is good, and the fries are very good. You really have to pick the right meats; the cheese steak meat is sub-standard, and a few of the others are less than stellar. But the cajun chicken, hot sausage, kielbasa, and others are very good. They make for big, messy, good sandwiches. The coleslaw is good as a sandwich topping, but doesn't really qualify as a slaw, as it is mostly vinegar soaked cabbage. It still goes well.",

I've written in another review that Pittsburgh has great bread and Primanti Brothers falls into that category.   The soft Italian bread envelopes a tasty sandwich of your choice. I opted for the cheese steak, but I should've gone with turkey. (next time!) Each Primanti Brothers sandwich comes with coleslaw and french fries on it. Yes, in the sandwich. Since I was in the PIttsburgh staple, I went with my friends suggestions and had an Iron City brew too.  Uh, perfect.",

    "text": "Ever since seeing Primanti Brothers featured on both Food Network and Man vs Food, I developed a craving for the famed Pittsburgh stuffed sandwich.  On a recent trip to the Steel City, I went to the Forbes Ave. (Oakland) location for a sample.  Even around 9PM on a Wednesday, the place was pretty packed.  Took a seat and was immediately asked what I wanted.  They have over 20 sandwich options, so I needed a moment to figure out my selection.  I opted for the cheesesteak, which they proclaim is their #2 most requested.  Oddly, they do not tell you what the top pick is.  Anyway, ordered a tall Yuengling (it is much better on draft than in the bottle, so don't hate) and within minutes my sandwich arrived.  It's a good thing the bread is so squishy, otherwise it would be impossible to get the thing in your craw.  Be advised on the cheesesteak, though.  This is not the Philly version.  In fact, the meat looked like some pre-formed, processed patty.   Despite this, the sandwich was tasty with nicely contrasting flavors and textures.    Although I should have been as stuffed as the sandwich afterwards, I was still feeling a little hungry.  I ordered a capicola (at the recommendation of our waitress) and ate it back at the hotel.  That was a much tastier and more satisfying version.  You can buy tall boys and 6 packs to-go at this location.  May have something to do with its proximity to the colleges.  By the way, this is not the original location.  That would be the one in the Strip district, which is also the one featured on TV.",

Mainly because of all the coleslaw and french fries piled high within the sandwich. The cheesesteak itself was okay and the meat looked processed. Not that great. However, the bread is nice and soft. I also ordered a pint of Yuengling on draft. Good beer...  If I do come back, I'm interested in trying the roast beef. It seems like this restaurant is hit or miss depending on what you order.

    "text": "All of these years and I've never visited any outpost of Primanti Bros. But recently, I found myself in Pittsburgh, and the Oakland Primanti Bros appeared like a beacon as we walked from our parking spot to the Pitt campus.   It was a sign. Clearly, I had to find a way to squeeze in a stop to this legendary sandwich shop.  Now, I have enjoyed a Pittsburgh style sandwich in the past. The first time I had one, and I experienced the rush of fries and coleslaw jammed in between slices of thick italian bread, I was overwhelmed with joy. Since that time, I had dreamed of having one from Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh.  Expectations can be a funny thing. Because while the pastrami and cheese sandwich was a real treat, I didn't quite get the fireworks I had hoped for at the mother ship. Maybe I still need to prioritize a stop at the original location in the strip.  As far as I'm concerned, it's all about the coleslaw. That thinly shredded, vinegar spiked, cabbage salad is fantastic. You need that vinegar to balance all the fat and salt from the meat, cheese, and fries. But the thick soft bread is a great fit for these sandwiches as well.  This location is on the smaller side. We were there with six people, and the staff was amicable about letting us try to squeeze six chairs around a four-top upstairs. Some might be put out by the lack of plates, as these monster sandwiches are served on sheets of wax paper. However, some of the best food is served on sheets of wax paper, so get over it.  Really, I think the best plan is to find a friend and split one of these sandwiches. Sure, with a hearty appetite, you could take down one on your own. But I'd rather feel satisfied than stuffed.",

    "text": "Man.. these sandwiches sure looked good and are stacked super high.. I was a bit hesitant to come here cause I thought everything would be super greasy and I don't generally like super greasy things BUT we were in Pittsburgh and this was listed as one of THE places to check out while here.  Whenever I asked someone what is Pittsburgh known for in terms of food, we were told to check out Primanti.  So I gave in and decided to come by and check out what the hype was about.  The inside of the restaurant is a typical bar type feel - nothing fancy, not super clean... but there are tables both downstairs and more seating up top with an overlook where you can see your food being made below.  All that oil to deep fry those fries!  And they grill the meats before putting your sandwich together! We ordered:  *Spicy Batter-Dipped Pub Pickles - they were like pickle fries!  I didn't get the spicy but I did get pickle and I loved the crispiness of the batter! Probably the best thing we got! 5/5  *Corned Beef & Cheese Sandwich - all their sandwiches comes with the meat, cheese, cole slaw (more like shredded lettuce cause I didn't taste the mayo in it), tomatoes and hand-cut fries on Italian bread.  The sandwich was actually less greasy than I thought it would be - I was super surprised.  The flavors of this sandwich was a bit on the bland side - I think the fries overpowered the meat. 3/5  *Pastrami & Cheese with a fried egg - This one came with pastrami and the same fixings as the sandwich described above.  We added a fried egg cause the server recommended it - saying it was his favorite.  I liked the flavor of this sandwich better than the corned beef, I think cause the meat had more flavors to it. These guys are really filling though so half a sandwich filled me up perfectly. 4/5  *Chicken Tenders and Fries - I didn't try this but I hear the chicken tenders were moist and perfectly crispy.  The fries were a bit over fried and burnt.  I'm not a fan of hand cut fries, but these ones didn't stand out at all. My picky aunt ate the whole basket of chicken tenders so I'm guessing it was good. 4/5  Overall, I wasn't crazy about the sandwiches here and didn't know what the hype was about.  We had an Uber driver from the area who agreed but also others who said it was the best thing ever and you can't go wrong!  I guess this is one of those places you like or you don't care for - but either way, the sandwiches were filling, they were stacked miles high and made for good photos of crazy eats, and it made for a good Pittsburgh experience!  At least I can say I tried it!  Wasn't a horrible experience (at least it wasn't super greasy and soggy) but wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had either.",

Try out the Pittsburger and Cheese (it's their most famous sandwich, but they list it as #2). The one special thing about it is that it has coleslaw and fries in it (aside from that, it's not much different from any other sandwich).",

Sadly, tomatoes and cabbage, which seemed to make the sandwich one of a kind, did not much impress me.  Staffs were friendly - I give a high credit to that.",

The sandwich was huge!!!!! There's no skimping on meat here. And while the flavors of the sandwich went well together, the thing I liked best is the bread which was soft and when you pushed the slices together it made all those flavors marry together even better.

You can see cooks preparing your food behind a glass counter, like at a Subway.   Prepare to eat with your hands and get really dirty. The sandwiches are served on a tissue, not a plate, so you can wrap up any remainders to toss out easily. Big, greasy, juicy hot sandwiches.   Got the jumbo baloney ($6.59) and steak ($8.39) sandwiches. Definitely go for the steak sandwich. Every sandwich is made with thick slices of white bread, so prepare for a carb overload. Each sandwich is tall because it is stuffed with cole slaw and french fries, which become soggy quickly. The cole slaw is full of flavor, tangy, tasty. The steak, melted with cheese was tasty. Wish there was more of it, as 80% of the sandwich consisted of bread, fries, and slaw.   Not the best sandwich I've ever had, but a filling bite for when you're craving something unhealthy.",

This particular location is constantly filled with Pitt students, and service here is very slow. We waited an hour for a few sandwiches. The best part of the meal was the tater tots, which were nice and crispy and piping hot!  I would come here only if you're working on a Pittsburgh bucket list.

    "text": "Primanti is a MUST if you ever come to Pittsburgh.  The place bleeds with Pittsburgh pride, as the wall is painted with historic and famous Pittsburgh figures, the screens play local sports, and the food just reeks of the Steel City.  As you might expect, the food is rugged, big, and wholesome. There's lots of grease that goes around, and they seem to feel that everything tastes better fried (?). I'm not saying fried stuff isn't bad, but I think it's a little excessive. One of their trademarks is having fries in their sandwiches, and honestly, I think the starchiness makes the sandwiches a lot drier and difficult to down. It also adds a void of blandness that drowns out the sweet lettuce or the savory meat. Also, I'd say their Pitts-burger isn't that great. It's a very standard combination of lettuce, cheese and patty, but I felt that the patty was really dry, and again, the fries got in the way.  Overall though, the place is lively, and is great for bringing large groups of friends to. Definitely drop by if you want a taste of black and yellow.",

We went there for lunch and got chili and the corned beef sandwich. The chili was fine, but it wasn't anything special. We expected more from the sandwich. Sandwich bread and meat were very normal. Fries weren't crispy or flavorful. The cole slaw had a horseradish-y scent, but it wasn't great or anything like I expected (and I usually love most cole slaw!). The highlight of the meal may have been the hot chili, because it was snowing on the day we were there and I was cold.  Service was fine, but the food did not live up to the expectations.",

    "text": "Free Wi-Fi, whaaat? Seems so rare around here. Anyhow..  We came here based on the recommendation of friends, my boss (a native), and the fact that it was featured on Food Network a few times. The place is pretty small and cramped, with seating available upstairs or downstairs. They don't give you a menu here -- instead, there are two identical menus hanging above the kitchen area with a font size big enough to be readable from any seat in the house.  Every sandwich is piled high with the meat of your choice and stuffed with cole slaw, tomatoes, and fries. Yup, fries. The beau loved this idea because that's what he does for all his burgers anyway and saved him the effort. He ordered their #2 best seller, the PITTS-BURGHER CHEESE STEAK. Though he enjoyed his sandwich, he did mention that it wasn't very.. cheese steak-y, but was still good in its own right. I got full after half of my roast beef so I offered my other half to him and he SCARFED that down. He didn't even like roast beef until that night. Good job, Primanti Bros! The other guys finished off their sammies, too. Btw, what is their #1 best seller? Why.. beer, of course! $2 Yuengling on draft? Oh hell, yeah!  It seems like this restaurant is either a big hit or just okay. Half of our party loved it, while I was in the other half and found it alright and probably wouldn't come back if given the choice. The food was mediocre, in my opinion, but it does have a cool atmosphere about it and the beer is cheap. The restaurant was incredibly dirty, with bits of squished food all over the floor. If I was a native, I'd probably brush it off (since I'd expect it), but being an out-of-towner, I wasn't impressed and was actually put off by it.  FYI, Oakland is college town (home of a handful of schools within walking distance - e.g. Carnegie Mellon, University of PA, etc), so the beer is plentiful and there's plenty of eye candy for you fellas!",

So, what makes Primanti's so special?  The enormous sandwiches and how they are made.  Huge portions of meats, french fries (served on the sandwich) crisp coleslaw and the doughy, Italian bread make up the legendary sandwich.     I recently had the opportunity to eat one of the delicious creations a few nights ago.  The place was packed with late night partiers.  The line was long, but the skilled sandwich makers were easily keeping up with the demands of the customers.  The woman behind the bar was slicing through the thick Italian bread at record pace as she flipped eggs and meat on the grill.  When the meat is cooked the sandwiches are completed.  They're topped with fresh-cut fries, homemade coleslaw, and tomatoes.  They're placed on a large sheet of butcher paper, and viola, you have your sandwich.   The first bite is always the best.  You have to position the mega-sandwich correctly in order to get your choppers around it.  A little hot sauce is the perfect accompaniment for the fries and slaw inside.  As we left Primanti's satiated, and I noticed the droves of new customers were coming in.  It's nice to live in a city with famous sandwiches.",

The meat was sliced more thinly than I had imagined it would be, however it made eating the monstrosity much easier. Obviously Primanti Bros knows what it's doing in that regard! Lots of people have described a Primanti sandwich to me as having \"fries all over the top of it\", so I was surprised to see the fries shoved right in the middle of the sandwich and cut in half. Since I ended up saving half for later I really liked the way they did that honestly. Additionally the massive yuengling drafts were super cheap the night my boyfriend and I went, so with half of a massive Pittsburgh sandwich I treated myself to the most Pennsylvanian beer one could drink.

I went to college in Pittsburgh and a few years after graduating moved back and lived in Pittsburgh again.  I've tried multiple Primanti locations.  I've tried it multiple times throughout my childhood and 20s.  I've tried different sandwiches.  I've tried it drunk.  I just...don't get it.  Maybe it's my hatred of cole slaw?  Maybe it's the fact that every time I've had one of these sandwiches the meat seems dried out, the bread seems stale, the fries are too greasy, and I just can't find anything to be excited about.  Nothing blows me away.  And I can appreciate a delicious, simple sandwich.  This just isn't it.  Probably one of the most over-hyped, over-rated places in the burgh.  Sorry yinz, I'm just not a fan.

From how it was explained to me, Primanti Bros. isn't necessarily famous for the quality of the food, but rather for it's culinary place/purpose in the history of Pittsburgh. I know it's probably hard to separate one's own experience from expectations raised from the Food Network hype, but this place is, and always will be, just a place that serves over the top, greasy, heart attack inducing grill food.  If you're coming here because you saw this place on a list, you're probably going to be disappointed.    Seeing the grill, the shabbiness of the establishment, and reading over the menu helped to manage my expectations pretty quickly.  It's a greasy spoon restaurant, plain and simple.  Thankfully I have a soft spot (probably several soft spots with the amount of times I visit places like this) for grilled and fried monstrosities.  I think a mistake that people probably make is reading on the menu that the 'Pitts-burger' is the #2 seller (after #1, beer), and subsequently ordering it with the thought that #2 ='s 'best thing on menu'. This is probably a HUGE mistake Primanti Bros. makes by advertising it.  Our waitress, who was certainly an incredibly friendly oversharer (read:  brutally honest) said that she didn't really care for the Pitts-burger compared to other burgers around the city that she's eaten, despite it's popularity.  She actually gave us her top 3 menu recommendations, and we ordered those instead.  I ate the pastrami and cheese sandwich, which I thought was very tasty.  I had never had fries and coleslaw IN a sandwich, and the flavor was different than what I was expecting. I washed it down with a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, which I was happy to see they had on tap.  The prices for everything were all very reasonable for a 'tourist trap'.  Do I think this is the best food I've ever eaten?  Not even close.  But I do think it's near the top of the pecking order for greasy spoon dives.",

We found a table upstairs. A very helpful waitress greeted us. Patiently she answered all our questions and made recommendations. Around thy able we ordered Pastrami (with onions), roast beef (x2), their #2 popular sandwich, Pitts-burger, and chicken breast Ragin' Cajun style. We also ordered their pub pickle which was battered and deep fried - it was really good!  All sandwiches came in with two large slices of Italian bread and jammed packed with fries, coleslaw and tomatoes. Everything was good except for two problems. First, there is just too much fries within a sandwich -it just overpowers everything. Second, sandwiches are a bit dry with no sauce. Prices were reasonable.",

Based on the description of the sandwich you would wonder why I gave this restaurant even three stars. This is because of the classic local restaurant atmosphere and a great atmosphere can make sub-par food taste so much better.",

Primanti Bros was featured on TV for its enormous sandwiches, which in addition to a generous helping of meat also feature fries stuffed in between two slices of bread. That's what made them famous, that's what got them on national TV.  The quality is above average, and as expected, the fries just add more bland carbohydrate-ish taste and additional calories to an already unnecessarily calorific sandwich. The meat itself is good quality, but also nothing to write home about.  The short: overrated, nothing special, there are better sandwich shops to be had for the price.",

I ended up taking out all of the coleslaw, which made the sandwich more bearable. The bread was soggy from all of the greasy overcooked fries. There was also barely any capicola.  The chili cheese fries were terrible. The fries weren't even crisp, and they used cheap nacho cheese over the fries. The chili tasted as if it were from a soup can. I definitely expected better, especially from how much hype this establishment has received.",

In theory, it sounds like it would be fun to fit as much as you can between two loaves of bread; however, it is not as appeasing in practice. The best game-plan that I can offer is to try to bite the sandwich as is for the first bite in order to appreciate the experience, and then to \"accidentally\" allow the french fries to fallout during the second bite so that you can appreciate the food.  This location is also a memento for many Pitt students as a few late night journeys involve a stop here.",

I liked the concept - take all the ingredients you would find on the side of a sandwich and dump them IN the sandwich but it wasn't well executed. I've tried the cheese steak and the pastrami and wasn't blown away by either. The fries are a bit on the soggier side and the ratio of coleslaw to fries isn't right (too much slaw), but these factors don't detract too much from the sandwich for me (you can always remove some slaw). I think the main problem is that the sandwiches as a whole are lacking flavor.  Don't get me wrong - these aren't BAD sandwiches. I think it's definitely worth the experience to go once and see what it's like but the sandwiches could be a lot better.",

By coleslaw, I don't mean your average drippy mayonnaise coleslaw. Primanti's coleslaw means fresh and crisp. Add a side of Cajun fries and you got yourself a meal of champion.   They have friendly employees and play good music. It's such a good place to meet up with friends for a casual meal.

For some reason, I couldn't stomach the fries and coleslaw this time around. The coleslaw started having a weird taste after a few bites and the fries were just weird and soggy.

    "text": "What a bummer.  When I ate at the one on Steubenville Pike, I was happy with their service and sandwich.  This joint really disappointed me.  First of all, I had to wipe down my table and get our placemat/menus.  It took forever for our server to finally get to us.  I get it's busy, but WTH, hire more people to serve the patrons.  Then I ordered the pastrami sandwich.  Lots of fries.  Lots of coleslaw.  Lots of bread.  Okay with the cheese.  Then I asked, where's the pastrami?  Well, where was it?    I was sorely disappointed and wish I had gone around the corner to that burger joint that I know I would have been happy with.   The rest of my family felt the same way too.  Unless you like eating a french fry, coleslaw, cheese sandwich for $7 and wait for a long time, I would recommend going somewhere else.",

    "text": "Came here a lot as a student and it was a solid meal. They put a lot of meat, fries, and cole slaw into the sandwich. It's definitely not anything mindblowing, or especially innovative but it's uniquely Pittsburgh and it's got all the carbs and meat you need if you're hungry/hungover/drunk.  You can also pay a bit more for double meat or an egg and you can ask for onions for free. Getting an egg on the sandwich is fantastic. You can also ask them to remove the cole slaw or the fries or have them on the side instead if that's not your thing.   This place is pretty close to both CMU and Pitt and there's a ton of bars and other restaurants in the area too so it's nicely situated and a ton of students end up going here. They also have beers on tap and it gets really dive-y on weekend evenings.  I would recommend trying the sandwiches starting with pastrami, kielbasa, or knockwurst. The non-sandwich items aren't great and I'd probably pass on all of those.  Definitely a place to check out if you're in Pittsburgh.",

It's one of those things you just have to do once if you visit Pittsburgh.   We ordered two capicola & cheese sandwiches to go (we were told that was the best one). I asked for the slaw on the side but they gave me the slaw in the sandwich and the fries on the side- wah wah. Overall, it was average.

I went to the one near Pitt at lunch, and aside from the difficulty I had finding parking, I enjoyed trying a sandwich from this iconic Pittsburgh chain. I went with the capicola sandwich, and of course, it came on thick, white bread, vinegar-y coleslaw that was crunchy and generous, and french fries on the sandwich itself. It was a big sandwich! I thought the ratio of meat to bread to coleslaw to french fries seemed to be a little low on the meat side, but it was still worth experiencing. I sat upstairs, and our server was friendly and on top of our dining experience, even though it was during lunch time on a week day. I recommend trying it out for a unique sandwich experience.",

You can't really go wrong with picking any sandwich off the menu. Tots, fries, and sides are run of the mill. Sandwich portion sizes are rather large and extremely filling so take note of that when you place your order. As for quality, I find their sandwiches to be rather average and have tasted better ones elsewhere. Though the meal itself is rather filling, the quality of meats they use really leave something to be desired. Have tasted better sandwiches at other places (try Peppi's in the North Side; you won't be disappointed!).",

The slaw tasted like the stuff from a carton and the fries would have been better on the side.

I agree with the reviewer who said that people either love or hate Primantis, but personally I think the people who hate it just don't quite understand it. People: this is not gourmet food. This is greasy, artery-clogging trucker food. Adjust your expectations before going in, and you'll have a great experience. Don't go to Primantis if you don't want to get stuffed on bad-for-you-but-oh-so-good food. It's really that simple.  The Oakland location is my favorite precisely because I love the dingy, dirty atmosphere. I enjoy sitting on the second floor and looking out over all the other diners enjoying their food, but it's also fun to pull a seat up at the bar and watch the guys behind the counter do their work. It's impressive. Plus, my boyfriend and I have discovered that the sandwiches served at the bar are actually bigger than the ones served at the table! (Not that it needs to get any bigger.) My favorite is the double egg and cheese, though if I'm feeling crazy I'll add bacon. You can't go wrong with the sausage, either: sweet or hot, take your pick.   If I lived in the Burgh, I'd probably go all the time and maybe get sick of it and want to write a bad review, but as it stands, the five or six times a year I get to enjoy a Primantis sandwich are some of my happiest food experiences.",

It's an interesting sandwich with thick bread (not toasted), choice of meat, coleslaw, option for onions and of course fries in the sandwich.  The fries are not that flavorful and were quite dry when I had it.  I ordered it with easy fries and slaw and it still overpowered the sandwich.  The overall sandwich is not bad, but it's definitely not amazing or even up to par with other sandwich shops.   I would recommend trying it at least once and I can see myself venturing back here every couple of months or so if someone new is in town to visit, but it is definitely not at the top of my list.",

I almost always get a hot sausage sandwich with fried egg, and there's no better comfort food on earth- it's an earthquake of spicy, meaty, blue-collar goodness. It's ambrosia to my rust-belt soul.  I'm very sad seeing the number of horrible reviews people have given this place. I'm a current customer, so I know it's not the case that the place has just \"gone downhill\" or whatever. I don't know what people are expecting when they walk in the door, but it's clear that a lot of folks aren't quite getting the magic of the place and its food. It's been said that Pittsburgh has a \"nostalgia-industrial complex\", and maybe that's part of it: I go to Primanti's when I need to remind myself of who I am, where I've come from, and where I'm going. I know that that sounds terribly hokey, but it's the honest-to-God truth. Going to Primanti's is like going back home after a hard day, and seeing people trash it in their reviews gives me the same feeling I imagine I'd get if I saw someone belittling their own child's artwork: the point isn't to decide whether it's a world-class technical masterpiece... the point is to enjoy it for its uniqueness and its idiosyncrasies.",

Maybe if the fries were a little crispier it'd taste better, but that's just a hypothetical. A sandwich is about 7 bucks and certainly is filling, yet it's not all that palatable.
