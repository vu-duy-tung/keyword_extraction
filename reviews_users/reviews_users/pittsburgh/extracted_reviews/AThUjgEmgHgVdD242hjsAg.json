The service is always fast and friendly but this place definitely gets way too overcrowded than what I would expect in an establishment of this quality. If you don't get your name in quick expect to wait at least 20 minutes before you get seated which is not worth it in my opinion. The food is just okay nothing really spectacular but I do like the little plates of food that they offer. MY biggest personal hang up is the menu ranges from the little plates to giant entrees that mostly consist of pastas, steaks etc. And if you want something a little but lighter than an entree but larger than an appetizer you basically have to settle for a sandwich or a burger. I went with a plate of 2 cheddar sliders which where flavorless, dry, and overcooked. I'd go back but not on the top or my list.",

Service has always been prompt and good.  Since we typically go there late evenings, we have no experience during busy times.  My wife requires gluten free and she has been able to find sufficient GF menu items.  She typically orders the sea scallops.  I have had the Southern California Fish Tacos a number of times.  Well, they might not be quite as good as those you can get in San Diego, but they are the best I've found in Pittsburgh.  Most recently, I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad and found it to be a better than average Caesar salad with tasty grilled chicken and the added touch of warm polenta croutons.  We keep going back because we've always had a good experience there.",

I always order the same thing (grilled chicken sandwich with a cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom on top), so consistency matters to me. I've only ever gone there for lunch, and have always been seated immediately - maybe that's the secret to avoiding the long wait times other reviewers have mentioned.   While there's nothing particularly flashy or fancy about Houlihan's, I like knowing I can count on a fast, yummy lunch served to me by someone pleasant and helpful. It's my standby.",

The chicken/avocado eggrolls are an excellent app. I also savored the Petite (4 ounce) Filet Mignon, their mashed potatoes (sooo good), and their S'mores Crock, which is one of the neatest desserts anywhere (you dip sugary graham cracker sticks and fresh strawberries into this marshmallow/chocolate fondue...mmm...). The service was great. Some of the waitresses show a little too much leg, though (they kept having to pull down their tight, shirt skirts). Anyway, good eats here.",

The bartender I had was named Bruce, not only did he basically ignore me the entire time I was at the bar, I watched him make my Long Island iced tea (without any alcohol) but other drinks minus alcohol as well. I had to send the drink back and get a beer, if I didn't I would have gotten a virgin Long Island iced tea.   Secondly, there were a ton of people at the bar however I received a drink and was promptly ignored for about 45 minutes. I was waiting to order food but couldn't because I did not exist to the bartenders. They eagerly served the \"regulars\" and had great conversation with them.  Unfortunately I couldn't give a rating under 1 star but if you are on a business trip, do NOT go to this restaurant unless you have to go hungry for the night and have no place else to stop.",

One thing I've learned though is that each restuarant should be judged on its own merits.  To be fair, the chicken salad sandwich I had was pretty good.  One thing I like about Houlihan's is that you can get a choice of sides.  So instead of fries, I tried the peanut ginger slaw with my sandwich.  It was pretty good!     For dessert, we split a vanilla bean creme brulee that was good too.  They do offer an Italian Style donut concoction.  Pump that insulin Susan, pump!",

I have to point out though, that the hostess was as far from friendly that they come. She's probably in the wrong business. Anyway...they seated us directly across from another table, so it was almost like we were sitting across from each other on an elevated stage bc they were the side seats which sit up higher. We were pretty much forced to sit side by side because of the oddly shaped table.  So I ordered the mushroom flatbread which came with a soup or salad. I decided on the Tuscan white bean salad. It was white beans with arugula and almost like a salsa/bruschetta and two pieces of toasted bread and a dollop of goat cheese. It was pretty tasty I must say. Not much to it really, but good. Also a healthy option which is nice. We shared the Thai Asian wings and they were PERFECT. Perfect crunch, and perfect flavor. I'll be back for more wings for sure!

We are typically there on a Thursday night so Andrea and Kurt are usually behind the bar---they are great--friendly, always pleasant and accommodating and good martini makers!

Food takes forever, is mediocre at best and the staff all act like they hate their jobs and don't want to be bothered.  The one thing that bothers me more than anything is that the kids menu says that all kids meals come with carrots/ranch beforehand and ice cream after.  After eating at other places that do this, like BJs, I would have expected the carrots to come out immediately.  I have 4 kids and after waiting a long time for our table on a sat night that would have been a life saver, however we never saw those carrots and haven't the last 4 times we ate there.  Why on earth should we have to ask for them? Again after we finished  eating I couldn't help but wonder if the waitress was going to ask us if we wanted the ice cream, as my kids knew about that and were expecting it.  Nope, she never offered, I had to ask, and she acted like she couldn't have been more annoyed that she had to get us 4 ice creams.  I'm sorry, but if it's such a pain to do these things don't offer them.  We likely won't be going back anytime soon.",

My case is as follows...  *The Spicy Chicken and Avocado Egg Rolls are a hearty, crunchy, meaty, and flavorsome example of fusion gone well.  *The Honest Gold Mashed Potatoes (they were out of Loaded Baked Potatoes, so this was a second choice) are an honest-to-goodness side-dish one would expect at your favorite aunt's home for Sunday dinner. Fluffy, thick, buttery, starchy notes for hours, adding bacon or cheddar or lobster to these simple and simply savory spuds would ruin them.   *The So Cal Fish Tacos are packed with a flaky, wet, panko-coated tilapia, a piquant/sugary honey-cumin dressing, pico to wake the dead, a napa cabbage slaw to keep one regular, and a chipotle mayonnaise to glue it all together and because, well, mayo is nearly vital to almost anything savory and handheld.   *The S'mores Crock continues to be one imaginatively decadent, deconstructed dessert.  *Houlihan's makes a damn deadly brownie sundae that rivals the best of the best anywhere. The hot, the fudgy, the creamy, the cold all combine to create a quintessential version of a dessert that appears on menus nationwide.   *The service was phenomenal even if I wished some of the younger female staff weren't wearing short, tight skirts and so much makeup (trying too hard to get tips, ladies?). They resembled the bar-harpies that haunt Carson Street on Saturday nights, and they needn't have.   On the downside, this Houlihan's is located in Mt. Lebanon's Galleria mall, so one can expect to dine alongside the privileged, the Botoxed, the money-hungry, the hair-plugged, and the overly tanned.   Nonetheless, as with the other Houlihan's franchises I've visited, this location dependably dished out to us a meal that was respectably above the notch of average, Houli's givin' us what we needed prior to catching a certain comics-inspired feature at the nearby Carmike.  Snikt!

On a Friday evening, as busy as the house was, we were seated without waiting a single minute. Were we just lucky?",

    "text": "We used to frequent the Mt. Lebanon location.  It seems every time we go it gets worse and worse.  This last visit was the straw that broke the camels back.  When we walked in, employees were huddled around the fire place and I became concerned.  As we were walking to our table there was a giant space heater sitting on a random table. I thought this was odd and unsafe.  Needless to say when we got to the table it wasn't a comfortable temperature.  We figured okay. Maybe they are having a problem. We'll tough it out. We were starving. We were greeted right away by our server who was very friendly. He brought us a jug of water to the table with our glasses. This is something new to us here, but it seems many restaurants are doing this now.  I'm not sure where they filled up this jug from, but I think tap water would've been better. I'm not even sure it was water it was so gross.   We both got something else to drink and ordered our food.  I went to visit the men's room and I wasn't even at the entrance to the bathrooms and was punched in the face by a god awful odor. The kind of odor that no single human is capable of producing(I'm not one that's overly smell sensitive). I held my breath and proceeded in.  The bathroom had to be 100+ degrees. This made the sewage smell unbearable.  There is definitely something major wrong with the plumbing here.  The bathroom itself was disgusting. Think creepy gas station bathroom and multiply that on the grossness scale.  When I got back to the table I started looking around closer and noticed the table wasn't really clean. The dust on the fixtures around the restaurant, you get the picture. With how dirty everything was. I was questioning the kitchen cleanliness.  I kept trying to talk myself out of how dirty it was because I was so hungry and didn't want to leave or wait somewhere else.  Huge mistake. Our food came out in a normal time frame. When it was delivered I noticed this god awful smell.  I thought it was the dressing on my girlfriends salad. Nope, it was the roast beef on my French dip.  I can't even explain how bad this was. Imagine cat food left sitting out for a week. The smell was so bad that we both were gagging with the plate sitting on the other end of the table. I was beyond grossed out as I already consumed soup.  I told my girlfriend to not eat her food as it definitely wasn't safe.  We hurriedly asked our server for the check and boxes as we aren't ones for confrontation. We got out of there as fast as we could.  Threw the food in the first garbage can we found and went elsewhere.   It's sad to see how far down hill this place has gone.  There are many new restaurants opening in the Galleria and we will choose them over Houlihan's from now on.  I highly suggest you do the same.",

I'm allergic to shellfish and told my waiter ahead of time that I had an allergy. I tried to order 4 different times and was told I couldn't order anything that was fried (even chips or fries) because they only have one fryer for their fried food. As somebody with an allergy, this is ridiculous. Restaurant standards dictate that you have at least two fryers for your fried food. Not only could I not order what I want, but when we alerted the manager to this (very politely) he became very agitated, rude, and belligerent and berated us for not ordering something different. Although he ended  up taking my food off of the bill, I was very disappointed with the quality of service and the management in general. I used to love Houlihan's, but I will not be returning.",

A friend and I decided to go here before a movie in the Galleria Mall to grab some drinks and a late lunch on a nice Sunday afternoon. After we sat down in the dining room, we opened our menu to find that there was a happy hour all day on Sundays, and when we asked the waitress, she said it is only for the bar. I find this silly because 1) there was probably two tables of people in the entire restaurant- it wasn't like we were hogging a good seat, and 2) the hostess didn't tell us about the happy hour let alone that we had to sit in the bar; but I guess rules are rules. We politely asked if we could relocate, and we did; to the tiny back corner table of the empty bar area.   We agreed to just let it go and enjoy our lunch: we decided on the loaded guacamole w/chips and the firecracker shrimp, and then we split the BBQ ribs dinner for our entree.   The loaded guacamole had a sweet salsa & crumbled cheese on top, but it lacked flavor. It tasted like mashed up avocado; no lime juice or seasoning to speak of. The firecracker shrimp, although the shrimp were crispy, it tasted really mayo-y, and was not spicy at all! It was very off-putting.  The BBQ ribs were okay-tasting, but were barely warm let alone hot and the fries didn't have any seasoning on them.  The beer was cold, a plus I guess! Needless to say, I will not be back. Which is unfortunate because it's 10 minutes from my house, and I frequent the Galleria mall for movies and shopping on the weekends.",

The service, for this price-point, is above what I typically see, especially in this area.  Servers typically know their menus and dishes well, and can answer questions in detail.  The menu is centered on American cuisine:  some beef, some chicken, some seafood, several deluxe, entree salads, a handful of sandwiches, and some starters.  They do have some unique starters:  White Bean Humus, for example.  It comes with toasted pita bread and fresh vegetables (baby carrots, celery, and sliced cucumber).  It is delicious.",

My favorite roast beef dip is one thing I get often. It's usually lean and quite good. I've been told it's one of their top sellers. Today, my sandwich was very fatty and had beef gristle on it. It literally was struck between my teeth. I tried to pick through the sandwich and realized I could not. The manager took it off my bill and offered to make me another. The experience just sort of ruined me for wanting that, so I decided not to eat. He was apologetic and took it off the bill. He offered s dessert I gave to my children. I realize things happen, so I think I'll will wait a bit and give it another try. I know there are people that complain over everything and I'm not one of those people. Something has to really be inedible or I won't say anything.",

    "text": "It is to be expected on a Friday evening for a restaurant to be busy. However when told the wait will be 45-50 minutes and you end up waiting 63 minutes, that to me says that the productivity is not doing well. But like I said, it was a Friday. So getting a beverage from the bar is recommended while you wait.    We were seated in a nice booth. The server was nice, obviously a little overwhelmed, not holding that against her though. We were able to place our food order in a timely manner.      We started with chicken tortilla soup and a house salad. The soup consisted of corn, tomatoes, chicken and tortilla strings. It had a hint of lime and a kick. Resembles a chx fajita taste. The salad was a basic house salad with the exception of corn on it. It also had a choice of mozzarella or goat cheese, bacon bits, tomatoes and croutons.     The entrees we chose were the shrimp tacos, a side of fries, and seared Georges scallops. The shrimp tacos consisted of 2 tacos with 3 jumbo grilled shrimp. Each soft taco had lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and lime and was drizzled with sour cream. Also served with a side of chips and salsa. The side of fries were good and obviously a generous serving size.     The seared George's bank scallops were very good and were presented well. It was served over a bed of a basil infused olive oil rice and arugula with a balsamic glaze at the bottom. Definitely a thumbs up.      For dessert we decided to have the caramel almond crunch pie, because it was the picture on the dessert menu and looked fantastic! However, when it came it was melting! We were not aware it was ice cream cake! But whatever. It was very tasty! It was vanilla ice cream with crushed almonds mixed in. Chocolate and caramel crunchies on top with a chocolate almond cookie crust.      The wait was long, the service was not bad, the ambiance was nice/ casual, the food was good, the price was a little bit above average, but for dinner it was not bad.",

Steaks are good and veggies have always been fresh as well as mixed drinks.  Recently they did make some updates to the decor and menu which seems a little smaller. It's a big place but walk in on a saturday night put a reservation in and the longest you'll wait is 45 minutes. They have a text notification so you can go walk around the mall while you wait for your table. Nice touch.",

If you have the unfortunate idea of dining there at night, you'll feel like you're in Abercrombie and Fitch (meaning - you'll need a flashlight to read your menu). The restaurant attempts to be very trendy with it's dim lighting and decor, but it's more annoying than anything. I suppose they don't want you to be able to read the overpriced items when your receipt comes.  There's little to be said - the food is nothing more than average. They have a wide selection of available foods and drinks.   My main concern with Houlihan's is the treatment of their workers. I've witnessed on several occasions managers attempting (and failing) to quietly berate several workers. They then turn around with a smile on their face and act like they didn't just treat the waiter or food runner like french fries they found under the grill.  I have no desire to return, as Houlihan's is nothing more than an overpriced restaurant with nothing to offer as justification for it's prices",

When I used to work near here, I had fond memories of grabbing take out orders of the stuffed mushroom for us to munch on, or convincing friends to hold weekend dinner gatherings here so that I can easily pop down after work.   But I really don't like Houlihan's beyond its convenience. The food is expensive, and the price is justified by neither the food quality nor quantity, and I've always found the decor a bit dark in here.   The service is good. They're definitely adequately staffed during the rush hours, and everyone is friendly enough.   But I still wouldn't come here on my own accord... I just don't think the price is justified by the flavor or portion of the food on the plate.   The one exception, though, is the potato soup!",

Nevermind the menu...now half what it once was, but it's unforgivable to pare down and still manage to foul up what's left. In the last ten visits we've spoken to the manager five times and by rights it could've been more. Pittsburgh's south hills has limited options and it's being exploited here, but do we deserve and continue to support rubbery chicken parm(microwave chef), a very long hair in the salad dressing, cold pommes frites, missing bananas on an entree' salad that's supposed to have them?  The short version, talking with a manager is ok, (we're not eager to see a mega chain Joe's Crab or Carraba's take over), but it doesn't do any good here ...and really, should you have to at all?  Sorry Houli's, but we're done with ya.",

It's always quite busy when we visit and on weekends you can almost guarantee there will be some type of wait. The staff at this location are always pleasant and the service is overall outstanding. The food is also delicious as well. I usually opt for different items, while my boyfriend usually orders the brentwood chicken sandwich. Their house salads are awesome because they are decent in size and the lettuce is chopped up pretty small, which I love. Most recently, I tried the spicy cauliflower appetizer which was so delicious and I ordered the brentwood chicken sandwich as well. The portions are generous and the chicken sandwich was big enough for two meals! Overall, we really enjoy coming here and will absolutely be back!",

Sometimes the kitchen is a bit slow when they should not be, but....it happens. Again, for a chain, they do fine.  Salad and soups are good...burgers are fine...I prefer them to mix up the menu more, but it is chain.  The atmosphere here is nice.  Place is enjoyable.",

    "text": "We came to Houlihan's for Valentine's Day dinner, using a forgotten Christmas gift card! 7pm reservation, no wait. The lighting and decor was just right. We opted for the Valentine's menu. Their special shrooms really are amazing!!! Loved the house salad with corn - unique and refreshing. Entrees filet and salmon with sides followed by dessert trio. The food did come out a bit fast but it was all delicious and we had some to take home. Will come back for sure.",

    "text": "This place is great, we have been here twice recently in the past month and we had great customer service both times. First was Mother's Day and they gave all of us moms a flower as well as 10 dollars off our next visit. We went back to claim our 10 dollar voucher yesterday before catching a movie since it was so convenient. Mike our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. He found my son a pack of markers which kept him entertained the whole time. He also gave us another voucher which we will definitely be returning to use! Also, I would highly suggest this place for families because every kids meal comes with an appetizer \"carrots and ranch\" as well as a dessert \"ice cream with chocolate syrup\".",

    "text": "Came here on a Wednesday night and surprisingly there was a 30 minute wait. We walked around but there really aren't many shops left in the galleria worth going in.   I ordered the heartland grilled chicken salad and my friend ordered the buffalo blue chicken salad. The heartland salad was ok nothing special. Grilled chicken, red bell pepper, pecans, cheddar, croutons and garlic ranch. There was barely any dressing so I asked for more on the side.   For dessert, we had the mini fried chocolate donuts. They were freshly made and delicious. Can't beat a crispy warm donut covered in sugar. Overall nothing special, a standard chain with mediocre food.",

    "text": "Houlihan's is a total hit or miss experience.  I've had times where it was a wonderful experience and meal and times where everything went wrong.   I've been to this location with only one other person and also in larger groups.  It seems some servers are better equipped/more used to large groups then others. The restaurant itself is fairly long and narrow.  Booths on the side and tables in the middle with the bar in the back.  The kitchen has clear glass windows so you can mostly see in the kitchen (but not the type of set up where you can really see the chefs or food prep). I like the menu because it is the type where there really is something for everyone.  There is more trendy stuff like avocado (which was delicious but should have been called guacamole toast).  Things like ahi tuna as well.  But also standard burgers, salads and grilled chicken. Presentation of the food is generally done pretty well and everything I've ordered has been tasty. As I mentioned earlier, there are some servers that don't seem as trained, so those experiences haven't been as nice, but the management does what they can to make it right.",

    "text": "Houlihan's in is the Galleria so it's easy to find parking in the parking garage there. We came late on a Saturday and also had one of their $10 of $30 coupons so it was a perfect time to try it out. Surprisingly for being nearly 9pm there were quite a few diners. The thing I didn't like was how near we were seated to the bar area, because a few of the people hanging out there were very loud and on the verge of obnoxious. I also didn't like how dark the dining area was, I had to use the flashlight on my phone in order to ready the menu.  Our waitress Mary was very polite and kept the meal moving along at a perfect pace as well as keeping our beverages topped off. Didn't have any idea what kind of food they served here but a quick scan of the menu it appeared that they are trying to be a higher end chain restaurant. My husband started with the house salad and it looked awesome, you could smell the bacon on it as soon as it got to the table. It was loaded with fresh corn, tomatoes, shredded white cheddar and croutons all on top of a hearty bed of shredded lettuce (my favorite cause it's easy to eat!) He went with the Pot Roast. He said parts of the meat were tough which should never be the case with a pot roast and that the carrots were a little too al dente. Flavor was good and the crispy fried onions in top have a nice crunchy contrast. I went with the Scallops. 8 nice sized scallops surrounded a creamy risotto that had tiny little disks of asparagus running throughout. It was topped with a hearty helping of arugula. It could have used more salt but the scallops were cooked well and cleaned well so I guess I couldn't complain. Overall the meal was good but nothing spectacular. It seemed like they try to make more high-end dishes to compete with fancier restaurants, but the overall wow factor when comparing to one of those restaurants is lacking. Would I come back, maybe if I got invited to something, otherwise not likely.",
