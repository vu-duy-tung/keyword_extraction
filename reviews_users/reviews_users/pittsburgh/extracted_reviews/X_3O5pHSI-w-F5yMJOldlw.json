    "text": "I stopped by here this past Thursday night with my fiance for dinner.  We were downtown early for a dance lesson and were looking to kill some time eating dinner.  After entering Market Square we looked at our choices and chose the Oyster House after noting its shaded outdoor seating.  With our decision made, we walked into the Oyster House to get some menus.  The inside of the place consists of a large bar on one side and a line of tables on the other side.  Each table already has on it some hot sauce as well as some vinegar with hot peppers soaking in it.  Soon after we entered we asked the bartender if we could sit outside.  She said yes while giving us some menus and letting us know that the closer we sat to the door, the better service we would have.  With that we headed out the door and sat down in the only shady spot further away from the door.  I did notice that there were two different servers waiting on people outside and figure that was what the bartender was referring to.  After a little bit longer of a wait than I would have liked (and wishing we were sitting closer to the door), we were waited on and I ended up ordering the titanic platter while my fiance went with the crab cakes.  My titanic platter consisted of the monster fish sandwich and 2 sides for which I chose the Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters and then I upgraded my second one to the New England clam chowder.  After only a short time both of the clam chowders came out of the kitchen.  It ended up being surprisingly good with a nice creaminess to it and what I think was fish in addition to the clams.  My fish sandwich was also pretty good as the two filets had a nicely cooked thin coating that was crunchy.  The Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters were also a slight disappointment as they were merely potato chips.  I guess I probably should have asked about them instead of just ordering them.  Finally I was also able to taste my fiances Maryland style crab cakes which I did not  think were good at all.  There was not a hint of old bay in them and it had a distinct mayonnaise taste to it.  The bottom line for me is that I might be back here in the future.  It's never going to be my fish pick of a restaurant in Market Square but I did really enjoy the fried fish and see myself eating here from time to time.",

    "text": "Traveled to this establishment through busy downtown event traffic seeking oysters. Sat at the bar. I ordered a Corona with lime and it was given to me promptly and it tasted fresh and cold. Soon after that I was informed they were completely out of oysters. An oyster bar having supply issues like this is completely inexcusable, especially one that operates in a high profile location like Market Square. Also, the bartender seemed very unhappy, and was having difficulty fulfilling his duties. He was having verbal conflicts with the waitress who was attempting to order drinks from him. When another guest had an issue with a dish that had been served to them, the staff yelled up the stairs to what I assumed to be the kitchen for someone to come down and resolve the matter. Very unprofessional atmosphere. The tension among the staff was palpable, it just didn't seem like any of them really wanted to be there, which made me not want to be there. The supply issues and the way the employees were operating leads me to believe this place is poorly managed. I paid for my drink and left, not wanting to risk putting in a food order to the overwhelmed staff for a dish I didn't come for anyway.",

This place is cash only so make sure you bring it. Loved that the crispiness of the fish and the fries were amazing. What I really loved about this place is that on the table they have oil, vinegar, tartar sauce, hot sauce and the fish came with cocktail sauce so you get to try a huge spectrum of taste with your fish.   This is my kind of place, its reasonably priced, quick, a variety of condiments, great food, they have booze, if I am ever back in the Burgh I am stopping here.",

Not sure why this was needed. Looked around and decided not to order food. Both of us work in healthcare, one doctor and one nurse, and feel sure things were not up to code. The couple next to us ordered drinks and declined to order food as well after the woman went to the bathroom. Nice server but terrible customer service from bar lady who also had no clue of contents of a Long Island Iced Tea. Reading a few reviews here where people got sick after eating there. Be careful!",

This place has been around for years and you can tell it, from the black-and-white pictures hung on the mirrored wall behind the bar to the fading tiles on the floor.  I had a crab cake sandwich and it was perfection.  Large chunks of crab on a potato bun with a swish of mayo, lettuce, and tomato slice.  The house-made chips are great, though I didn't get a whole lot of them with my sandwich - probably less than a serving, though I'm okay because the sandwich was so good, you just needed a little crunch to go with it.  My boyfriend got the jumbo fish sandwich (not to be confused with the massive fish sandwich) and it was indeed jumbo.  Huge piece of fresh cod on a kaisesr roll.  It was the kind where the ends are hanging off the bun.  I can only imagine the size of the massive sandwich!  The fish inside was tender and the batter was perfectly crunchy and golden.  Fresh, delicious fish cooked perfectly.  Our server was super nice and took great care of us.  Definitely put it on your list!",

The chowder was as good as last year. Rich, flavorful with tender clams and soft potatoes. My clams and my friends shrimp were both perfect. Downed with a Stella and you can't go wrong.      We watch them bring out their next to largest fish sandwich and it was huge. well worth the money. I'll be having it next year with the Chowder.      Don't miss it if you love Clam Chowder.",

One is a bar with waiters and liquor, the other is a fast food style place. I chose the latter. Walk in and you will find a menu board with a few specials printed out hanging off of it, no frills, no credit cards, all local flavor.  I went with the Titanic special $10.75 Which included a \"monster\" fish sandwich, and two sides, I chose fries and onion rings.  Everything is made to order, which means crispy fries, rings and a crust on hot flakey fish. The fish here is the real thing not some unnatural square, a large fillet of mild white fish with a great breading on a simple bun. The condiments are on the table and up to you, tartar sauce, hot sauce, a spicy \"famous\" vinegar and ketchup. It was a big sandwich but not titanic maybe just queen marry.  Bottom line if you want some fried food and have cash give this a try.",

Portions are large, I got the \"fish nuggets\", I expected tiny nibbles but was pleasantly surprised by prepared mountains of battered fish the size of my fists.  Prices are extremely reasonable, my wife and I happily stuffed ourselves and got drinks for under $30.   The prices are good anywhere, but especially for  the prime downtown hot spot of market square.  The Oyster House is Pittsburgh's oldest bar and restaurant, and has been featured in several movies over the years.  They have lots of vintage photos hanging on the wall.  The staff is gruff, but friendly, True Pittsburghers.  The bad: As I mentioned, it was founded in 1870, and it doesn't appear to have been updated since, it felt run down. The atmosphere is lacking, they serve you with paper plates and plastic utensils.  Anything not fried was mediocre.  The crab cakes and deviled crab were oversalted.  They don't serve Heinz Ketchup which seems wrong given both their historical heritage and that they are located about 100 feet away from the Heinz Global HQ in PPG.  Would I go back to the Original Oyster?  Sure!  Great portions, low prices, tasty food.  I want to try the \"Monster Fish Sandwich\" which is supposedly Moby Dick sized (eat it before it eats you!)  But if you're looking for a high end experience with classy atmosphere, this isn't the place.  It's a good bar with good bar food, go in with the right expectations and you'll be well satisfied.",

No, of course you don't because I wasn't acknowledged as a human being! Apparently if you are a single diner you don't deserve to have your order taken or even seated.   I walked in here tonight and wasn't greeted, then stood awkwardly in the door way for a few minutes until the bar tender asked if he could help me. I said I'd like a table and he told me to wait for a waitress. Still nothing. No one came over.  Then I was handed a menu by the bar tender and sat myself at a table. 20 minutes later, nothing. Even when a family was seated immediately next to me, the waitress took their order and didn't even look at me as I stared at her face and got to point where I had to wave the menu around to get her attention. Nothing.   Eventually I had enough and left, which they still probably didn't notice.   Make sure to bring a huge group of people if you do make the mistake to eat here, because that's the only way this backwards place will give you any respect.   If not, and you're alone, don't waste 30 minutes here without being acknowledged like I did.",

I decided to get lunch here after figuring out I've eaten everywhere for lunch downtown at least 3 times.   I ordered the crab cake meal; 2 cakes & 2 sides. I chose french fries and green beans (i dont know why the beans, just wanted to say I had green beans for lunch) I was satisfied. Everything was okay and it filled me up. I saved one of my crab cakes because of how full I was, then gave it away to a nice lady on the street. She seemed satisfied :)   **however, i prefer my crab cakes more like a patty instead of mushy & more crabmeat than breadcrumbs...... :(   I have to bring Bobby here to see what he thinks..",

When they arrived they were served in little plastic Dixie cup shooters and were flavorless and gelatinous.  My fiance did like her fish sandwhich but when she told the server she gave her regular Pepsi instead of diet our server rolled her eyes and stormed off.  I do not recommend this restaurant. Please support good food and service in Pittsburgh elsewhere.",

The response was \"Nope, it's a first come first serve basis\", and a HANG UP.  I called back to give feedback; the same person answered \"hello\" and HUNG UP AGAIN when he heard my voice.  If this is a traditional Pittsburgh eatery, I'm ashamed to be a Pittsburgher.  What I love about this city is its humanity.  I have no problem with the policy...just never hang up on a customer.  It's a shame for the restaurant; we have a large family that we had planned to host.  Shame on them for losing a big tab!",

    "text": "OOH is a cross between a British Pub and an old-fashioned American counter-top dinner. The decor provides a traditional feel (and so does its clientele).  I decided on the Fish-n-Chips and was almost tempted to order a side too given the inexpensive prices which must be as old as the restaurant; the Fish-n-chips were $7.50. Given the price, I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the food but found myself content once I had a bite. Both the fish and fries were crispy and had a pleasant taste from the batter. My only complaint was that the fish came in three pieces as opposed to one large piece.   Also, OOH has a house-made pepper vinegar sauce which I decided to try. The basket was sufficient without the vinegar, yet I enjoyed it so much that I decided to generously apply it to.",

I use to frequent often, not any longer.  I think today was my last visit.  Strange that Mary is not sick, not retired, just not working there anymore.  Something had to happen.  Probably just like corporate America, 30 year loyal employees are no longer valued!  12/5/2016.   Returned to give them one last chance. Got the tuna sandwich.  I really loved their tuna for years now.  It was not the same, actually tasteless!! The price went up from 3.90 to 5.90.  The sandwich is half the size served in a small hamburger bun.  Maybe 3 oz portion.  The bun was the cheap ones out by in a grocery store.  The onion rings were not deep fried long enough, they were hard.  Well this place really is going down hill fast.  Not like it was when Mary was running the show.  This was my official last visit.  My prediction is that the regulars will be abandoning this place and it will only be the tourist who will be unknowingly experiencing a crappy meal.  Mary if you reading this, you are missed!!!",

    "text": "I came in to grab some lunch before I went off to work. It was nice and sunny outside. Pittsburgh nice, at least (30s and sunny). Still....  I looked over the menu and its short and to the point. A handful of fried seafood things, a small collection of non-seafood sandwiches, and some more various fried things. I settled on their special, which is two crabcakes plus two sides. I got the fries and the onion rings. I also orderd an \"original oyster\" which is actually a gigantic hushpuppy with a very tiny oyster inside of it. I was pretty bummed out by that because the two crab cakes were really just basically hushpuppies with a few pieces of crab meat and an occasional piece of krabmeat. Definitely a bummer. The fries and the onion rings were cold. Also a bummer.  Everything tasted okay, I guess. Lots of salt in the crab cakes and oyster. The onion rings, if they were fresh and hot, would have been great. They're freshly made, crunchy and you can actually bite through a piece of the onion and not yank the whole onion out.  The service though...well..it sucked. The bartender ignored me the entire time I was there. I had drank through almost all of my soda before my plate arrived. And yes you yinzers, I said soda, don't act like you've never heard that one before. After I was done eating, I asked for a refill of my soda. He then disappeared for about 10 minutes, which is just long enough to finish a cigarette and cell phone conversation. Hey, I used to be a waiter, too. I know what you're doing. So after he comes back, he hands me my bill. Then he remembers I asked for a soda 15 minutes ago and finally refills my cup. This is approximately 25 minutes after my plate arrives and my cup was dry the entire time.  Other than that, the place is a dive. I like dives though, so this is no thing. They have a good handful of beers, if that's your pleasure. They only had one type of wine, much to the dismay of those seated right behind me. The food's alright, would have been better if it was hot. And I'm sure if I had just kept it simple and gotten a fish sandwich or fish on a dish, it might have been a decent meal. I probably won't be going back. Its in an inconveniant location, the food is barely even par, and the service is horrible.  Also..they do not accept cards. Though they do have an ATM (Mack Machine, whatever the yinzfolk call it), outside.",

We got all of our food on Styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. The \"waitress\" stood and watched us eat most of the meal. This particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.

We walked to the Oyster House from our hotel so I'm not sure where you would park since street parking is very, very limited.  It is on the Market Square.  We went on a Saturday evening in January.  At the time that we went, only the small bar area was open.  There is a large eating area with chairs and tables adjacent to the bar but it was not open.  The bar area is not very big but there was a good amount of people flowing in and out to eat and for take out.  The food was very reasonable.  The next time we are there I would like to try their oysters.  I saw someone else's order and it looked really good.  They have a full bar available.  I had a side order of calamari and my hubby had the shrimp basket.  He liked the spicy sauce that it came with the basket.  The shrimp was almost popper sized but he enjoyed it.  The calamari was the ring type, more on the thin side.  It was good, not rubbery.  At each table they have tartar sauce, ketchup, vinegar and hot sauce.  The place is very casual, relaxed and reasonable.",

Overall - If you have never been, come at least once to check-out the decor and have a couple oyster shooters & fish sandwich to compare to the other known place Whooly's (i think?)...Taste wise nothing \"out of this world\" but good portions",

Yep, you'll be saying OOH yourself when you see the size of the fish slab you get on your sandwich.  It's probably not too healthy, and their sides are a little hit-or-miss (I enjoy the mac and cheese and onion rings), but the OOH knows how to put a piece of fried fish in between two slices of bread.  There's tubes full of tartar sauce for an even unhealthier topping, and the option of chicken finger or crab cakes for non-fish lovers, but let's face it - getting any of those is a mistake.  Go with the fish sandwich or - if you must - an oyster sandwich.  Anything else isn't worth the trip there.",

It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \"Original Oyster House\" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \"first restaurant\" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \"historical landmark.\" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place.",

After the meal I asked the waitress for the directions and the key for the ladies room. Why it's locked I don't know. On the way back through the dining room a rat ran out of the kitchen and across the dining room in front of my feet! Totally gross!!! I'll never eat at this greasey spoon again it was disgusting!

    "text": "I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for.   (By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)  Anyway, back to the sandwich:  I got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.  I ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish  So, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better Pittsburgh lunch- not even Primanti's.",

The name of this restaurant is pretty common, so it might be easy to confuse the place with a chain. It's not, just so you know. Essentially it is a bar, with a few tables put towards the wall, and a dozen red-neck looking types hanging out drinking. There is kind of a weird smell that is hard to describe. I used the bathroom to wash my hands, but I felt I had to use hand sanitizer by the time I got back to the table. To top things off there was this grease all over the table. How'd the food taste? Not so great. I had fish and chips and with it being a house specialty and all, you'd think it would be pretty darn good. But it was average at best and the fries ('chips') sucked. Nearly everything on the menu is fried and I only saw the word 'oyster' in three places - once being at the top of the menu.  This place is CASH ONLY. I guess their business practices haven't changed much since this place opened up.  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars Relative Price = 4 Stars Service = 2 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 1 Stars Clean (yes/no) = hell, to the no.",

I would walk down Forbes Ave. after class for a fish sandwich, a couple of 'oysters' and a glass of buttermilk (upgraded to a beer after I became legal). The whole thing cost me about 50 cents in those days.  I stopped back yesterday to remember old times. The place looks largely the same, but the crowds at the bar are gone. The oyster cakes still taste  good, though; a lump of seasoned cracker meal rolled around an oyster and deep fried to a light brown. While the oyster cakes largely serve as a vehicle for hot sauce, they still taste like they used to 50 years ago. The prices are much higher, but the place still holds fond memories of Pittsburgh's working-class past, when the railroad workers would pack the bar after their shifts. The Oyster House can still serve up a good lunch or afternoon snack, along with a lot of memories over a cold one.",

Definitely not the place that I remember.  The waitress seemed disinterested at best.  You had to be buzzed into the men's bathroom.   We then discovered that there was no sink in the bathroom.   That has to be a code violation.  We were lead to the back part of the old restaurant that had been turned into some sort of a Zombie room experience to wash our hands.  I can't make this stuff up.  With so many other wonderful places to try in Pittsburgh I don't know why anyone would visit here. If you want dingy and dirty with average food this is your place.  If you want nice seafood in Pittsburgh, go to Rolands in the Strip District.   We should have walked across the square and gone to Primanti's Brothers instead. It never disappoints.   The good reviews for this place that have been left by others are truly mystifying.",

I love oysters normally, but these were slimy, flavorless and all around disgusting. It felt like they'd been sitting in a vat of their own slime for a while. I'm guessing they order these oysters for deep frying, and really shouldn't have raw oysters on the menu at all. On top of it all, they weren't even cheap ($13 for 6), came in plastic cups with plastic forks on no ice.  We also shared a bowl of chowder which was pretty good. The soup earned them a second star. I suspect that the fried seafood, which was most of the menu, would have been pretty good too. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be returning to try them, too grossed out by my first experience.",

Although the restaurant was sparkling clean, it didn't smell great (I suspect it was some sulphur-based cleaner vs a sewage problem).  This place has been here forever and it shows - the decor is extremely dated - from the unflattering flat florescent lighting to the old-school message letter sign board menu above the counter.  Not a great look for a Market Square eatery in what has become such a trendy area where competitors offer tastier, fancier fare around the same price.  The food was okay - I got some fresh, hot, underseasoned scrod (fixable) and some *really* good, fresh coleslaw.  The fish was hiding under a giant piece of lettuce with a tomato slice on top (not sure what was going on there).  Everything was plated like a charity worker plates food for the homeless, but again it was hot, fresh and the seasoning thing was fixable with all the available condiments they have in-house.  Big issue is their \"cash only\" policy, which they neglected to put on the door for all to see (I checked).  So, after waiting in line once, I get a nasty surprise at the register with my credit card in hand.  Had to go outside to the (conveniently placed) ATM just outside that charges $2 to withdraw and get back in line a second time.  Not a happy experience during a time-sensitive lunch with friends.  Judging strictly by the food, this place was okay, good even.  It is just in serious need of some Gordon Ramsay-style upgrades to bring this place into the 21st century either by making it a bona fide vintage eatery or Millenial-grade chic seafood to match the rest of the eateries here.  Right now, it's got that \"old and tired feel\" down pat.",

We said no, so she perked up and asked if we wanted to look around and hear about the history. She showed us all of the pictures of past Miss America pageants that the previous owner went to (a lot!) and told us the history of the place. Women weren't even allowed to eat here 'til the 60s!   The clam chowder was incredibly rich and salty in the best way. As for the oysters, we ordered the \"lightly\" breaded option, which comes with three fried oysters, but ours came with four as a bonus. The batter was seasoned great, and apparently the same recipe since 1916, but if that's what they mean by \"lightly\" battered, I wonder what their heavy battered option is like. Our oysters had a very thick coating of batter so the oyster taste and texture was a little lost in it. We also had a couple clams with some sandy grit in them :/ The clam chowder was so good and the service was some of the best I've ever had, so it brought what would have been a three star rating from me up to a four.",

I think the place survives on its bar business and history.    They also do not have a True oyster bar.",

If you're looking for fresh shucked oysters on the half shell or a variety of oyster options... this is not the place for you. It was a pretty run-of-the-mill seafood joint with less than exciting options. Everything was decent enough, including the crab cakes and fried oyster platter. I was just hoping for something special. Fried oysters and onion rings were more breaded than actual substance, the green beans seemed to be poured right out of a can. If you're looking for a decent meal in Market Square, it wasn't bad... just didn't hit it out of the park for us.",

I'll tell you why, because I love the chicken tenders and fries!! Yes just like a kid, I love them. There's nothing unique or fancy about this meal but something about the way it's cooked up makes it delicious. Maybe it's the pride the employees seem to take in what I call job well done.

It looked like a child's portion. It had to be less than 2oz. I had the crab cakes but couldn't find the crab. The French fries were soggy and greasy. The cole slaw lacked flavor.  I had a coupon, which had expired. The condition on the coupon stated it was still good for the amount ($7.50) we payed for it but the owner refused to honor it and told me to take it up with the seller, HALF-OFF PITTSBURGH.",

She was impatient & bothered by customers being there.   As though the service wasn't bad enough, the food was awful. None of it was fresh or homemade.   The clam chowder tasted like a low grade canned potato soup. There were no clams in it whatsoever.   We asked for extra crackers - the waitress informed us that customers are allowed to have 2 crackers each & she wasn't allowed to give us anymore.  The same goes for napkins.   I opted for a side salad with the Italian dressing - it was definitely from a bottle, & not Kraft either.   My boyfriend chose green beans for one of his side options - yup, you guessed it, they were mushy, canned green beans served in a two ounce clear plastic medicine cup.   Our coleslaw came out warm & it too was served to us in the same type of two ounce medicine cups as the green beans.   The oysters were probably from GFS.   The butterfly shrimp were frozen, then deep fried.   This place is shot out, just like the staff.   It was nothing like this when I was a kid. I feel ripped off and disgusted. We'll never be back   We want a refund & reimbursed for the meals we bought at the restaurant we went to after we were rushed out of the Oyster House.   I felt so bad for the guys sitting next to us, who are visiting Pittsburgh, their experience was as good as ours.",

Drink prices are perfect if you order something like a draft or basic drink.  Grab an iron city!  Food prices aren't expensive either. I didn't eat there, but their fish sandwich seems like their most popular item!  I sat at the bar for 30 mins, saw a handful of people come in and out, and only heard friendly conversation and comments. Great place for being the oldest on the square!",

We have a changing pad and I assume they wipe the tables down, but still...invest in a changing table and stop letting people put their kid's asses where we eat. I then tied and sealed the diaper in a plastic bag we carry for that purpose and tossed it in the trash. The waitress was then upset because \"it would be there for days.\" Ok, well, take your trash out more often? You do scrape food into that barrel, do you not?

I was a bit skeptical based on some of the Yelp reviews. But what I found was the same great Original Oyster House I remembered. Had the Original Breaded Oyster and a Jumbo Fish sandwich. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted outstanding! Service at the Bar was first rate extremely professional and attentive.  If you want to try a great Pittsburgh classic highly recommend getting to the Original Oyster House!",

Fries and slaw good.  I will be back if in the area.  Service good between bartender and waitress they had us covered.",

Oysters, fried clams, fried fish sandwiches, etc.  Pleasant and efficient staff that has no problem letting you know they're busy and need to move on from your table.  In Market Square, which is cool on it's own with the cobblestone streets and history.  There is a tiny dining room and then attached is the bar and additional seating (which wasn't open while we were there).  The ladies bathroom is back there and you'll see that lovely metal spoon, with the key which lets you in.  And you need to be buzzed into the men's room, lol.  The ancient pictures on the wall and the fact I don't think it's been updated since it's opening adds to it's charm.  Wonderful bloody marys on the weekend (or anytime for that matter), beers, full bar, etc.  We had lots of appetizers and I'm a sucker for fried clam strips!  You'll love the no frills beauty of it!  Great fish too!",

This is such a fun, local Pittsburgh institution in Market Square, and it's definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.   ***CASH ONLY*** - ATM is on the premises, but just a heads up.   I tried both the Clam Chowder and the Spicy Whitefish sandwich. My brother got the Columbo sandwich   Clam Chowder - Very good, but not great. A little on the thick side for me and the potatoes weren't quite soft enough. Solid 3/5  Spicy Whitefish - Great, great , great! Such a generous portion of fish that was so fresh! Light, delicate, with a perfectly spicy and crisp batter. The bread was fresh and delicious. Sandwich came with homemade tartar sauce which was also a homerun. 5/5 and would get anytime!   Columbo sandwich - The Columbo is a fish sandwich breaded with Italian breadcrumbs. Very good and also super fresh. 5/5  Loved the service. Waitress and bar staff were awesome, and gave us all the history of the place.",

We ordered the clam chowder first to determine if we would order food.  So glad we did because it saved us from ordering a meal.  The clam chowder was watery and had no clams at all in it (or maybe minuscule pieces that we couldn't find).  It was like a bad version of potato soup.  Not realizing that they were related, we went to the popup Christmas bar next door.  What an absolute rip off! It was $22 for a well drink and a beer.  The music was ridiculously loud, and again, we were the only ones in there. I should have trusted my gut and gone somewhere that had customers.",

    "text": "On the last Friday before Good Friday a few of us at work decided to walk down to Market Square to Oyster House for lunch.  Perfect day for a stroll. Now confession, this wasn't my first time here. About 7 years ago a buddy of mine and I were walking through Market Square when a big hailstorm hit and we ducked in here to escape. He hates seafood but I love it!  We waited it out on the bar side with a few beers and I grabbed Clam Strips. Good stuff from what I remember!  Jump to today...I didn't even know there was another side to this place! The Bar side was full so we went one door over and there was still some seating open but a decent line was forming around 11:30a.  It didn't take too long to get through but you could tell the cashiers and cooks were overwhelmed. They did the best they could.  Totally worth the wait to get the CodFather Sandwich Plater that came with Onion Rings, Slaw and a Drink for just over $13 bucks.    The fish was excellent! The light and fluffy batter was different in a good way. And the slaw was some of the best I've had. Onion Rings were so so.  I'd probably just get fries or something else next time. I will definitely be back now to try other items!  I also love the history and decor here.  It oozes out of this place. From the pictures on the walls to the frame newspaper articles, you know this place is something special. It may not look the best, but I assure you every imperfection most likely has a story.",

Just a soft light taste. Worth another try if I get back here!   Everyone else loved their fish as well. Fries were just so-so nothing to write home about. Small dining area with a bar that extends the length. I'd try other fish on the menu based on the fish and chips.   Cost was not bad. Service was ok. No parking. I'd go back.",

The fish (on the Fish & Chips) was a disappointment.  The fish was chunky & flakey but the batter wasn't fully cooked.  The outside was crispy but the layer between the crispy outer layer and the fish was still pasty & batter(y).  It needed cooked for another minute or two and it would have been delicious.  If I go again- I'll ask for my fish to be well done (can I actually do that?).    Here's a tip for you all- Join their Birthday club, you'll be glad you did!",

I was told to go back outside and within a minute she would get to me. 15 minutes pass and she still hasn't gone out to greet our table. We assumed maybe they're busy but we waited on. Eventually, I went into the restaurant to ask for service again because we saw a lady assist a couple. I asked a different waitress to come take our order. She said yea one minute I'll be out. Now, we waited another 15 minutes and still no service. It wasn't until we saw 4 ladies show up. The waitress came out to attend them immediately. Ordering their drinks right away while we didn't even get water. This was an upsetting event for us because it feels like they were selective of who they want to serve.

She quickly asked if I wanted a menu followed by \"do you have cash? This is cash only\" I told her my bank was across the square at pnc and could order and walk over and get cash out. She said you need to pay before you order. Perhaps this is policy and it's understandable that she would make me aware of that. However she was very rude, and didn't seem to address any points of customer service whatsoever. Even Pbros which is considered fast food in my opinion, does a better job at greeting customers than this lady.",

Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome.  The cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way (if that makes any sense whatsoever). Their no-nonsense, \"soup-nazi\" style fits with the classic blue-collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine.  Bottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, \"Voted Best Fish in Town.\" I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town.",

The clam chowder is creamy and flavorful with plenty of clams.   I have never found the servers anything but pleasant. I suspect their behavior has a lot do to with who is at the table. When I come to Pittsburgh, The Original Oyster House is a must.   It is exactly what should be in a downtown and serves exactly what people have liked for 100 years. Thank you Pittsburgh for keeping food history alive.",

I ate them, but it is not something I will ever yearn for in my dreams. Not bad though. I don't think those oysters were from the Ohio river. That is good. This place gets 4 stars because of the atmosphere. It is an ethnographic experience. This isn't a place that tries to recreate a retro Americana ambiance, this is the real deal.

I could go for some good seafood, especially fresh oysters! Now, I am from an area not far from the ocean, and every year we had a community oyster roast, you know: fried, steamed, and raw oysters.   Ummm, yeah. Big let down. I should know better than to have high expectations. If I wanted Long John Silvers, or better still Captain D's (look it up if you never heard of Captain D's), then I'd hit up one up, AND get a friendlier server to boot. I also bet I could get into a ladies room without needing a key elsewhere, or even some SWEET N LOW for my tea! Sorry...the more I write the angrier I am getting. One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.  Ok, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok. At least they weren't too greasy. And the frigg'n \"original oyster\"... WHERE IS THE OYSTER??? Nothing but breading. I think I saw something resembling an oyster in there somewhere. And every entree had to be fried. Ugh.",

We were prepared for foam plates and cash only, which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters, famous fried fish, beer-battered fish nuggets, and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried, much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server, but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood.",

With regards to food,it's so so,I've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was ok,she checked on us maybe twice,the only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my wallet,good thing I remember my debit card pin,made a withdrawal,paid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but hey,it's part of operating a business. The food was ok but it's not memorable.",

We were on our way to the Pirates game and our locals told us it was the thing to do so, even though we were still full from a late lunch, we went there, got some beers, way too many fried oysters, and got the hell out of the way when the check was settled.   If you actually are going expecting to enjoy the food - be aware that an order of three lightly seasoned breaded oysters is the equivalent of three White Castle burger-sized oysters (cause they've been pounded flat) smothered in about half a cannister of 4C breadcrumbs and then fried. I think \"stick to your ribs\" is an adequate way to describe the sensation I was wrestling with on my way across the Roberto Clemente Bridge.   It's also one of those places where if you're trying to eat healthy and you order the salad, you get a styrofoam plate with iceberg and a couple anemic slices of tomato on top.

During the summers, they also have soft-serve ice cream which is a nice treat after lunch.  I keep coming back here because the fried fish sandwich really is worth it. A huge filet of fish, fried up simply. The fish is moist, perhaps a little greasy, but still delicious and the filet is thick so you're not getting more breading than fish.",

The crab cakes were possibly the most dense foodstuff I've ever seen.  The Fish 'n chips were like nuggets, the fried sampler was ENORMOUS and one of our guys ordered the Monster fish sandwich, yup, it was monster all right.  only about 1/3 of it fit on the bun.

First thing they said to us was, we only accept cash.  Ok, not a problem, old fashioned perhaps but we wanted fresh oysters on the half shell.  Guess what, no fresh oysters.  We proceeded to order some fried oysters, fish, onion rings and a few beers.  The oysters were still frozen in the middle, the fish was undercooked and the onion rings were terrible.  The beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star.  I was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea.  I don't recommend if you want good food.  If a cold beer is all you want, go for it.  Otherwise, stay away!",

I was a bit shocked to find everything served in plastic (plastic plates, cups, and silverwear). Also, this is a cash only place. I guess that explains why their prices are so low. We didn't go inside, but from just looking thru the window, it didn't look like much. At the end of the day, good food and good service. I would go back.",

We were lucky to have found 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was frazzled and running around it took him awhile to take our drink order. I ordered classic fish in chips . The fries were very good the fish was kinda greasy but the potion was perfect. This place is a pittsburgh legend u gotta stop in.",

    "text": "Rhode-Islander approved!!  How have I not been to this place before?  Authentic clam chowder, delicious fried fish, tartar sauce by the bucket... heaven!  I guess I can see where Pittsburghers may not share my sentiment, but believe me, this is the closest to New England-style seafood I have EVER encountered in the 'burgh.  OK, so they only have clam strips and not whole bellies and clam cakes (fritters) are nowhere to be seen, but the chowder and lightly breaded fish (Famous Fish sandwich) make up for it.  I loved the dynamic in this place.  It was CROWDED (Friday during Lent, what should I have expected?), but the kitchen staff was turning out fish sandwiches by the dozen.  This will definitely become a regular lunch spot for me (if, that is, I can find enough people in the 'burgh who actually like seafood).",

    "text": "Aside from a rather rank men's restroom that assumes you'll only have to relieve your bladder and not your bowels (there's no sit-down commode), I did not find Original Oyster House to be the poorly-serviced dirthole with middling food it is being made out to be.  OOH (how's that for an acronym?) has been one of those establishments I'd been meaning to visit for most of my life but just never got around to frequenting until Saturday's Occupy Pittsburgh march brought us to Market Square, giving Kay and I the perfect excuse to stop in.   We both went for the Make it Your Way Seafood Platter, which goes choose-1-choose-2-choose-1 on ya, granting the big-eyed diner the chance to sample a shipload of menu items for under $10.   You know I got the oysters, 2 lightly breaded ones to be exact, and they were as juicy, sea-salty, and deliciously slimy as they are supposed to be.   A crab cake came next, and my only complaint about it was that it was slightly lacking in the crabmeat. Other than that, I found it to be a lip-smacker.   I substituted a cup of the clam chowder for one side and a buck extra without looking back. The clam chunks were ample, the potato cubes yielded to the teeth beautifully, and the broth was creamy, buttery, ambrosial.    The Beer-Battered Fish Nuggets, however, shockingly stole the show, knocking the oysters from the stage to headline. The 3 gigantic cubes of fish (cod?) encased in a bronze jacket of yeasty, ale-imbibed bronze were saved for last so as to savor their innate succulence sans any sauce or condiment.   Not being able to resist and not having had one in a decade during a takeout meal, I had the Original Oyster. This isn't so much a breaded oyster as it is a fried, fat, starchy, elliptical biscuit that has an oyster in it...somewhere. It's not for everyone, and I'm not sure it's even my thing being that I like to actually taste the oyster, but it is a memorable novelty. Although, to avoid potential disappointment, I recommend sticking with the lightly breaded oysters (look for them on the menu).   Perhaps my roots are talking, but I instinctively knew I'd feel at home in this scrappy hangout despite what I'd heard and read, finding the swell dumb-waiter and welcoming, aged interiors anything but bleak. No, on this sunny, encouraging Saturday, OOH was alive with friendly chatter and a varied clientele.   As it is with Primanti's, the help is pressured due to the volume of traffic and are not grouchy. To the contrary, considering how busy OOH gets, I found the entire staff to be pretty jovial, so much so that I gave more than a 20% tip to our harried server, getting a smile and an excited \"Thanks hon!\" from her in return. Hey, she's one of the 99% too, y'know? God love her.   Then again, the reputedly crabby older ladies always end up taking a shine to me for whatever reason, and that's been the case for as long as I've been alive.   OOH is...\"real\". Not everyone likes that.  I do.   Maybe that's why OOH liked me.",

I had the oyster sandwich, clam chowder, and calamari. The oysters were very tender and I only wished the sandwich had a few more on it, cuz it wasn't very filling. Good thing I had the soup & calamari.. The clam chowder was sinfully delicious, with a heavy cream base and tons of flavor. The calamari was okay, nothing to brag about, but the sandwich and chowder couldn't have been better.  The oyster House is split up into two different restaurants next-door to each other.. To the right side is a sitdown restaurant with a bar and the left side is a casual quick stop shop with a counter to order at (which is where I chose to go). The interior is a bit dark & outdated and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere, but the outdoor tables in Market Square are a great option, weather permitting.",

The fish and shrimp are very fresh, though the crab cake was nothing special. The place is a historic landmark, and the decor suits the laid-back atmosphere. The service is pretty friendly, too. Overall, I didn't find the experience as bad as others have in the past, and the restaurant is worth checking out.",

    "text": "The Original Oyster House is a restaurant I've been intending to visit for quite some time, and finally got around to trying last evening.  Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed.  As you walk in, it comes across as a bit of a small, a little bit dingy, diner.  I have no problem with that, I happen to love diners, but it's not what I would expect from a place I am hoping to get good seafood.  The selection for beer with dinner was rather limited (but let's face it we weren't going there for beer, it's just something I noticed)  The service was seriously lacking.  When asking for our order, the waitress was literally on her cell phone.  I could never tell if she was paying attention to us or not.     I also found the set-up of the restaurant to be rather lacking.  It feels very claustrophobic, and while we were sitting up at the counter, a number of people bumped into me due to the fact that there is very little room to walk around.    Now, as far as the food goes, nothing was BAD, but it wasn't stellar.  Nothing on the menu seemed to be \"Great\" to me.  I ordered clam strips, and there was absolutely nothing special about them whatsoever.  They are the same clam strips I could get anywhere else I were to ever go.  There was no extra flavoring, no pizazz, nothing.  Just some strips of clam fried up.  Same goes for the french fries.  Now, the green beans I got were of note, because they were really gross.  There was no flavoring added to them whatsoever, they were just plain, boring, soggy green beans.  I was very much let down.  So all in all, if you are looking for something quick and find yourself downtown, the Original Oyster House is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking for some place that makes very unique, delicious seafood meals, find something else.",

Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves.

My mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!   I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.  I understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!",
