    "text": "After eating at many legendary Vietnamese restaurants in Albuquerque, I came back to Pittsburgh and this was my first trip for some Vietnamese food.  Pho Van didn't disappoint!  My friend had their Pho, and I went with the crispy tofu vermicelli dish. It was brimming full of amazing veggies, crispy tofu, beautifully sweet/sour sauce and even a salad on the side. I also liked their generous spring rolls and delicious peanut sauce!  My only disappointment was that they didn't have any sandwiches, even though their yelp photos seem to suggest they have them. So if you are looking for Banh mi, you won't find them here.  Otherwise, dig in with chopsticks into these great dishes!",

The only negative was the adequate wait staff.  They were not busy the night I went but only came back once at the end of the meal after our food came to give us our check.  Never stopped by to check on our drinks or anything else.  Not unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant but I'm still holding out hope that I will one day find that Vietnamese restaurant that knows a little about customer service.",

    "text": "After several more visits here, I am still impressed with their beef Pho and the small sampling of other dishes I've tried.  It is still the best Pho I've found anywhere in Pittsburgh.  Slightly better than Vietnam's Pho, and leaps and bounds beyond the quality of Tram's.  Their fresh shrimp rolls are HUGE -- a great deal for $4 and more than enough to split between two people as an appetizer.  Their beef pho broth is super tasty, relying on the umami of the meat to flavor it as opposed to being too salty as so many pho broths tend to be.  The portion is generous and reasonably priced, and it comes with sides of very fresh Thai basil, lime wedges, jalapeno slices, and plenty of sprouts.  I dump tons of basil and jalapeno and sprouts in mine, plus a generous dash of sriracha.  Yum -- just the way Pho should be!  Coming from a hometown outside DC with a huge vietnamese population and growing up on the best Pho of the \"Little Vietnam\" area (there's so many that the local paper once did a March Madness bracket-style Pho match-off between the 20+ restaurants), I'm actually pleasantly surprised with the quality of this Pho for Pittsburgh, where there's only a handful of places that even offer it.  My favorite order is the \"beef combination\" Pho, with flank, brisket, and eye round.  So delicious.  I'm not sure if they are still advertising having Bahn Mi or not, but they don't have it here!  If you're coming to the strip for that, you'll have to come back in the spring when Lucy (of outside-Bar-Marco fame) is back from Vietnam!",

    "text": "We moved to the Northside, so the Strip is on my way home.  The hubby suggested picking up some food from the strip on my way home.  I came across  Pho Van first, and so I went took a gander.  They have their menu outside, which is good, because the hubby is picky, and I needed to be sure there was something there for him before I committed to actually walking in the door.   So I found something, went in, ordered my meal, ordered some spring rolls, then was told they don't make said dish that hubby was supposed to be getting.  (Fried noodles).  !!!!!  Well, I felt bad bailing at that point, but seriously, there was nothing left on the menu that hubby would want to eat.  So I went with beef and rice.  It's simple, at least.  Review of the food:   My pho soup was pretty good.  It was prepared 'to go' somewhat weird - it was separated into broth and everything else.  I mean, I understand the noodles makes the broth weird if kept together too long, but I'm not getting this 'to go' to eat tomorrow.  As for my husbands food, it was AWFUL.  The meat was shriveled up overcooked in too much ginger and salt.  It wasn't just not good, it was nauseating.  I wanted to spit  it out.  We won't be going back.  Lulu's has good pho, and that's where I'll get it from now on.",

The amount of pork in the grilled pork rice dish is terribly disappointing. The pho is equally as disheartening. The broth is obviously from bouillon cubes (Miss Saigon in Oakland is also a culprit of this), and the little bits of meat are ridiculous. I'd pay maybe half the price that they charge for what they serve.  I'd rather walk all the way down the Strip to Vietnam's Pho where the food is better.",

    "text": "I haven't been to a lot of pho places in Pittsburgh, but this one is kind of the anti-pho place to the ones I frequent in Seattle and Austin.   First, most pho places are lightning fast in service. Pho Van took quite a while to deliver the dishes after ordering. It may have only been 5 or 10  minutes, but it felt longer given that there were not that many other diners.  On the other hand, most pho places prepare their spring rolls in advance leading often to an over chilled or worse dry wrapper. Pho Van's spring rolls seemed unusually fresh and tasty.  As for the pho, I ordered the combo pho (all beef meats and tripe) and the broth was very rich and flavorable. Maybe a little too much for my tastes and I may have over shot adding Siracha on my own. The meats were too well done for me as they were lean enough that they ironically came across as a bit tough/dry.  My experience was totally different from that of Ryu, very good balance of sprouts and noodles.",

I really wanted to say \"had better\" but I still need to give them a chance. It's probably my fault for ordering weird. I got the traditional Pho with beef, shrimp spring rolls, and grilled prawn with noodles.  A+ on presentation! Everything is very fresh...bright green colors on the lime, basil, and other herbs. Take note that when getting take out the beef is thinly sliced, raw and is to be cooked in the steaming broth. Chewy beef did not sit well and made me turn my nose at it. Left the beef but ate all the noodles and toppings.   I was in traffic forever and for future notice I probably wouldn't get this beef as take out.  I didn't see a \"minus the meat\" option? The menu didn't seem to offer a straight veggie selection. Hmmm I'm not a vegetarian but I like my Pho stocked full of healthy produce.  The Shrimp rolls were amazing and the peanut sauce had chunks of nuts that crunched while I chomped on the ripe sweet rice wrap.  The prawns are for lunch tomorrow so I'll follow up then with that dish,  I will just need to explore further with other dishes but probably won't do the Pho here again.",

Their pho includes all of the main meat components with the right veggies. If you order their other soups, you might not get the right ingredients and veggies that supposedly go with them.

They also charged for extra sprouts which I've NEVER had happen before. Their fresh spring rolls were very tasty. As far as the portion goes it believe it was fair for $10.

    "text": "Wanting to try something different for lunch today, I took a walk down to the Strip from my office in town to check out Pho Van.  I got there a little early for lunch and the place only had a handful of people in it. I was seated immediately, served a glass of water and was handed a menu. Glancing around at the place, I can only describe the interior as modest. The lighting was soft, there was light piano music playing in the background and a row of bamboo pools stretched the wall in front of me. The wall to my left had a few paintings of flower arrangements and behind me was a wall of photos depicting various scenes of the Vietnamese landscape. Quality chopsticks (not the break apart wooden kind that you get with takeout Chinese) were provided as an option along with the knife and fork.    I'm not going to try to profess to be an expert in Vietnamese cuisine; in fact I've only had it once before. So I after reviewing the menu I wasn't sure what to order and what to expect. I knew I didn't want anything real brothy, so I went for the Chicken Vermicelli bowl. It didn't take long for my order to arrive. The vermicelli was served, as you would expect, in a bowl containing rice noodles topped with a light spiced grilled chicken plank (sliced up), a spring roll, lettuce, bean sprouts, chopped mint, cucumbers, pickled carrots, peanuts, and a side of sweet chili garlic sauce.   When I originally ordered it, I had anticipated that the noodles would be warm -- a display of my ignorance when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. These noodles were served cold which, when I thought about it, contrasted the warmth of grilled chicken nicely.  I enjoyed the meal and felt nutritionally satisfied afterwards without feeling bogged down.   Would I go out of my way to dine at Pho Van again? Probably not. But if I was in a group and it was being suggested as an option for lunch or dinner, I wouldn't protest it either. For a lunch that came to under $10 (minus the tip) I'm glad that I tried it.",

On a previous visit to the Strip District we noticed a sign outside promoting the fact that they now sell bahn mi sandwiches here and that was enough to entice us in.  Sadly I did not see a single one of the items that they had promoted outside on the menu itself.  Whenever we arrived the restaurant was empty except for a single other table.  The restaurant itself is decorated rather sparsely with a couple of pictures on one wall and some bamboo sticks on the wall opposite of it.  For my lunch entree I decided to order the chicken vermicelli while my dad ordered one of the pho's.  My meal ended up coming with an egg roll which I enjoyed.  I really enjoyed the taste or everything in my lunch and the freshness of it made me feel like I was eating healthier than I probably was.  My dad also enjoyed his pho and told me that he liked it more than the noodle soups he has had at some of the better known places.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  Although there wasn't too much to Pho Van, the food was tasty and we were in and out quickly which is sometimes what you want from a lunch.",

( Lets be honest, Noodles/Rice are life FR FR) If you want straightforward Vietnamese food this is the place. Its located in the Strip District and kind of a small place but the food is phenoms so there usually is a wait (on the weekends) but never more than 10-15 minutes. Servers are super nice and very quick service. The food usually comes out in under 10 minutes, im always like: OMG that was fast!  The food here is always fresh and delish. I would recommend the Fresh Shrimp rolls as an App.. I sometimes get the Pho Ga (chicken)-there is nothing better than a good bowl of pho Ga, the broth is light, full of flavor and on point (like my eyebrows).  If you're feeling like you want something a little heartier, I would go with the Spicy Beef Noodle soup- which is my current FAVE! Ugh I love it! I usually leave with a full belly and some upper lip sweat (from the hot soup!) Love this place.",

Because of the location i assume pho must be pretty rare in the area making the prices higher. I received a bowl of pho for about $10, a little more expensive than normal pho would be. But this has got to be the most watered down-bland pho i have tasted yet. The soup had no flavor what so ever, and there wasnt many condiments to try and make it taste more flavorful. Service was not very good as they did not come by our table enough.  Best bet is look for a better restaurant worth your money.",

Nothing was done to remedy the situation: The manager didn't come over and they were hesitant when it came to taking the soup off of the bill! They still made me pay for my drink. Needless to say, I'll be finding pho somewhere else from now on. Honestly mistakes do happen but nothing I mean nothing was done to remedy the fact that there was a FLY IN MY BEEF PHO!!!!!",

The food is just below average in both quality AND quantity. I used to live in Philadelphia and Norther Virginia so I have been to lot of quality Vietnamese restaurants and pho Van just not one of them. Their portion is small and skimpy, dipping sauce is either bland or too sweet or too salty. The pho broth is definitely bland and barely has any pho flavor. And lastly the fruity drink mix has way too much sugar in it. Sorry but they need a new chef asap or this restaurant wont last much longer",

It's hard to compare restaurant pho to homemade, but Pho Van's is pretty decent compared to other pho joints in Pittsburgh. The ingredients are fresh and the price is affordable. Slightly smaller portions and slightly higher prices than its competitor, Vietnam's Pho, down the street. However, the restaurant decor at Pho Van is more intimate and inviting. One thing I noticed after eating pho here, though, is that it left me incredibly thirsty which can only mean one thing: lots of msg. So if the idea of msg doesn't bother you, this place has decent soup for decent money.",

I first had Pho in Chinatown in Montreal it was cold outside (duh Canada weather) and I told my friend that I just wanted something quick that will keep me warm and fill me up. So we walk into this little shop and I have him order me the beef pho, because I don't speak any language besides Pittsbughese but I'm working on it.   Anyway this Pho reminded me of that cold day in Montreal, warm full of flavor and spicy!! I have only had at one other place in Pittsburgh, down the street from this place. But this Pho was more flavorful to me, even tho the other place was cheaper.   FINAL Grade: I grade on a scale of \"Naw Son\" to \"You got to try this\"   Pho Van: Get it, Get it",

Because I was in the Strip for shopping purposes, this place was more convenient than the other Pho place further down Penn.  Since they both have similar ratings and each seems to have its adherents, I figured I'd try here.  Since I'd never had pho before, I was excited to try it for the first time.  Because I don't eat beef, I ordered the pho ga (chicken pho).  It was served promptly, about 5 min. after ordering, piping hot with all of the usual accoutrements (sprouts, Thai basil, lime, peppers).  I added in the first three, gave it a stir, and dipped in.  The soup was very pleasantly savory, and had a nice balance of flavors and textures.  My only major criticism was that I felt that the amount of chicken included was a bit on the light side--but then again, as a first-time pho eater, I don't have a good feel for what's typical in terms of the amount of meat included.  Nevertheless, I ate the whole bowl with gusto, savoring my first pho experience.  While I agree with other reviewers that the interior decor is a bit sparse and bland, this wasn't a make-or-break issue for me.  Service was fine, if unremarkable--exactly what I'd expect in this type of establishment.  Overall, I was pleased with my meal here, and I wouldn't hesitate to return for another bowl of delicious pho.",

Pho Van was recommended to me and I was glad to have discovered it.  The menu is basic but that is expected because of the type of place it is.    The decor is extremely basic and the atmosphere very casual.  I've found service to be sort of hit or miss.  They can be extremely helpful at times and other times you have to hunt a server down for a water refill.    I really enjoyed their fresh spring rolls.  They were huge, the ingredients were fresh and they were full of flavor.  I love peanut sauce and was glad they didn't charge extra or give me any grief for asking for extra to use with the spring rolls.  My husband and I both ordered pho thai.  The bowls were large and chock full of broth and noodles.  The broth had a good flavor (although I did still add siracha and hoision) But the amount of meat was almost non existent.  There was an upcharge of $2 for double meat and now I see why they have that as an option.  Check for discounts before you come.  They have a buy one get one in the Entertainment Book.  Overall, a great pho experience.  I will be back.",

This is such a great stop if you're hanging out at the Strip on the weekend, and a popular one--we snagged the last empty table when we swung by at 1pm on a Sunday.  At $11, it was pretty pricey for noodle soup, especially as the thin slices of beef and pork sausage were pretty sparse.  The noodles were too soft as well, but the broth was flavorful and satisfying, and I don't regret it one bit.  Accompanying garnishes of basil, jalapenos, lime wedges, and mung bean sprouts were plentiful.    The FRESH SHRIMP ROLLS were a nice size and freshly made, but mostly packed with rice noodles, with a piece of lettuce, some sprouts, and 3 small shrimp, but the accompanying peanut sauce was super addicting.  I kept it around throughout my entire meal to dip everything in.  My husband's PORK BANH MI was small but flavorful with nicely charred meat.  I prefer Lucy's for a banh mi at the Strip, but this satisfied my husband's craving just fine, though it was small enough that he needed to commandeer a healthy portion of my noodles, even after downing 1.5 shrimp rolls.  It was my friend's first pho experience, and she went crazy for the PHO with WELL DONE BRISKET, pronouncing the broth absolutely delicious.  For that reason alone, I'd call this experience a huge success.  It's hard for me to compare Pho Van with other nearby pho joints as this is my first Pittsburgh Bun Bo Hue, but I'd return in a heartbeat.  As all other Asian food around here goes, it's pretty decent for the 'Burgh.",

Brutally cold outside, we hunker in, there are a few empty tables that need to be cleared and cleaned, and we are told to wait.  Five minutes later, we are still waiting and standing, apparently the four servers can't get their act together and are prioritizing into counting money and other business at the cash register.  Having been before, I know the place has excellent food for the price, and knew what I was getting in for, but it is no point of eating there if the enjoyment is marred by such fundamental shortcomings, and when it can be so easily corrected.  My advice:  if you have tolerance for some customer dis-service, go there.  The food and price is good.",

I was happy to see that this is one of two pho joints within a few blocks in the Strip District.  A bowl of fun will run you $9.

Sometimes you'll get cilantro, mint and other times you won't. But you'll definitely get the bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, and lime. The last time I was here, they skimped out. However, the waitress did ask if I wanted more this time.  The pho broth was meh.. okay. Had to add some hoisin, chili oil, and paste to add some flavor. My favorite pho dish here is the combo of rare steak and brisket. Hits the spot on a cold day. Pho Van is expensive for a small bowl of pho. They don't even offer different sizes. What if I want a large bowl or x-large bowl? Trust me, I can eat some pho! I seriously inhaled the bowl in 5 minutes.  The bun. Two words. Sad. Expensive. You don't get much for what you pay for at this joint. But I guess the selection of Vietnamese cuisine is scarce in the Burgh, there's not much you can do about that.   The menu selection is small. Not much to choose from. :(  Although, it's cheap eats.. the quality and quantity doesn't add up compared to other places (not in the burgh). It won't break the bank.  food- 2 price- 3 menu- 2 service - 4 Overall: 2.75",

Like most other raters, I will agree that aside from the consistently decent Vietnamese food, this place doesn't bring much to the table. The decor is basically non-existent and it's often empty.

This was actually my first venture into Pho, so not realizing what good Pho is supposed to taste like, I thought it was OK but nothing special.  Well...when I ended up at Vietnam's Pho weeks later this Pho didn't even hold a candle to their Pho!  First off, the broth is nothing I'm going to suck down to the last drop (like I do at Vietnam's) and there wasn't as many ingredients in their seafood Pho like their is at Vietnam's.  I also eat my weight in sprouts and not offering any is a travesty here!    The absolute only thing I did enjoy were the egg rolls.  They were adequately crispy and the slaw and shrimp inside was a nice mix.  But good egg rolls alone doesn't get you to a 5 star status!  What does is a tasty meal, and this one just fell flat!",

It was completely different, and honestly it seemed tailored to the tastes of the region instead of being authentic pho. If you're Vietnamese American like me, you'll know what I mean! Real pho has to be beef-based, and this was not.  I was hopeful going in to Pho Van, because the menu  was partly in Vietnamese (compared to the other restaurant's completely English menu). The ambiance is not it's strong point, and the restaurant had this weird unappetizing smell. Not the trademark pho smell, but something else that I can only explain as not good. The service however was just fine, and the bean sprouts and basil were very fresh. I ordered 'pho dac biet' and was very pleased by the generosity of meat! Even in Seattle, some restaurants will skimp on the meatballs or the brisket, but my bowl was probably around 45% meat and 55% pho noodles. The broth was excellent, although not as hot as I would have liked.  Overall, this pho restaurant gives me hope for pho in Pittsburgh! It absolutely reminded me of Seattle pho, and I can't wait to come back to try more things on their menu. Under normal circumstances, I might be more inclined to rate this restaurant as a 3 because of the sub-par ambiance, but because it is real pho, it absolutely deserved the 4. Please get out here to the strip district and get a taste of genuine Vietnamese pho!",

    "text": "\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I can't really say that I've experienced better and I'm not comparing this place to other Vietnamese or Pho restaurants, but after my latest visit there, that is how I feel about this place - \"meh\".  The inside was rather small and cramped, but still left enough space to move around and not be seated directly on top of somebody else. The place was clean and decor was enjoyable. No complaints about the atmosphere at all.  When we walked in, all of the tables were full, so I expected us to be stuck waiting awhile to be seated and served. Despite this, we were seated, greeted by our waiter, and served our food very quickly.  Our waited was friendly enough, but of the three or four people working there however, he was the only one to greet or even smile at us.  The menu was very typical and had everything that you would expect. We settled for the crispy rolls (2 for $4) which were on the small side, but good enough for the two of us to split as a pre-meal snack and not ruin our appetite. They were tasty, but the sweet chili garlic sauce that accompanied them was terrible. I did not taste any chili or garlic in the sauce, just an odd sour taste that was enough to ruin the bite of the crispy roll. I've never tasted anything quite like it.  We ordered the pho with brisket ($8.95) and a combo rice vermicelli bowl with chicken and pork ($10.95). The vermicelli bowl was pretty good. A nice mix of noodles, cucumbers, lettuce, pickled carrots, and meat. It was nothing over-the-top delicious, but was worth it for the price.  I didn't enjoy the pho much. The noodles were good, but had nothing good to accompany them. The broth was light and bland, the thin slices of beef tasted like it came from a microwaveable freezer meal, and the bean sprouts had to be picked through because many of them had started to get brown and mushy on top.  Overall, everything was pretty hit or miss. Nothing really stood out as being spectacular or makes me want to go back for another visit. There are a handful of other places in the Strip District that I'd rather eat at, so I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.",

I had avoided this place for a while due to more glowing reviews of places like Tram's Kitchen, but after having made my first visit here, I have to conclude that Pho Van has the best pho in Pittsburgh (so far). This is after having tried Tram's, Pho Minh, and Tan Lac Vien; I have not tried Vietnam's Pho a few blocks down. Tan Lac Vien has a few good higher-end items, but I don't think pho is their strong point. The other two feel more authentic and homey, but for whatever reason their pho don't match up to what we had at Pho Van. Prices are comparable, but I think the portions here are bigger. The soup base was quite rich and the noodles were appropriately soft; the combination came with lots of different servings of beef, from rare beef to meatballs to tripe. In all of these aspects I think Pho Van came out on top--it feels a lot closer to the famed Pho 75 in the DC area than do Tram's or Pho Minh.  It may be that there's a consistency problem and we just got lucky, or they just improved a lot recently. I hope it's the latter. In addition, we also got a combination vermicelli, which was delicious. Generous servings of pork and beef, and I love that it automatically comes with a spring roll. so there is no need to order a separate appetizer if you're craving that.",

But we stayed, and knowing he was completely in the weeds didn't make a fuss and still tipped...however the service was pretty bad since he had at least five tables with more people coming in after us.  We each had an order of the fresh shrimp rolls which were good.  I had the wonton soup with pork and seafood stuffed wontons which was good and satisfying.  The food was good and not that pricey, so if the service would have been better would have given more stars.  But as a byob. we sat with a bottle of wine that didn't get opened with no glasses for at least 45 minutes until the appetizers came.  So good food, but won't be back.",

I ordered the 'famous' beef pho and there were probably like 3 thin small slices of beef which I thought was ungenerous and crummy  however, that didn't disappoint me. What did was finding another bug in my pho; I was in disbelief so I had my friend confirm given I was more cautious with every bite since the first mishap. Unfortunately, it was indeed another bug. I don't know if it just landed in there or the vegetables weren't washed or what but it concerns me that it happened twice with different dishes. I definitely lost my appetite at that point.  On a lighter note, the boba smoothie was pretty good and the waitress was nice.",

Cha gio tom/Fried Shrimp Roll - The roll was over fried with part of it turning dark brown; the vegetables insides was mushy. The overall taste was that of oil and salt. Ehhh.  Pho tai/Rare Beef Pho - The condiment tray was great. The Thai basil, the bean sprout and lime were all extra fresh. The rare beef was thinly sliced and was served rare. The amount of noodles was on the light side, but this wasn't a deal breaker. The broth was murky and flavorless; it seems like the only ingredients inside the broth was salt and msg. Usually when I eat Pho, I like to drink the broth until I'm uncomfortable with the amount of salt I've ingested. At Pho Van, I had no desire to drink more than a few spoonful.  I generally don't rate Asian restaurants based on service and atmosphere. Good service here, but the table had some food matter from the last customer. AC seems to be out or turned off today.

Place was running at capacity on a sunday afternoon with about a 10-15 minute wait. There were about 3 servers taking care of the whole place and seemed a little overwhelmed but they were friendly and tried to check in on our table whenever they could.  Food: The shrimp rolls are certainly fresh with mosit rice wrappers, soft noodles, a hint of mint, and savory peanut sauce. My vermicelli bowl was good with the pork being grilled on skewers which is new to me. The meat was a little dry but had a nice soy-lemongrass marinade with a hint of char-grilled flavor. The noodles, however, were a little skimpy and could be devoured in 4-5 mouthfuls. The grilled pork rice plate had 2 pork chops which partially compensates for the fact they're super thin however because they're so thin, they aren't as hearty and tend to overcook really easily. The fried egg was also cooked through and not a runny sunnyside-up like you'd hope.  Setting aside some of the cost-saving measures taken by Pho Van, the flavors are good and generally True to the genre. If you're craving vietnamese food, it'll hit the spot.",

I only say that because I don't want the owner to have an excuse of \"well we don't sacrifice taste for cheap ingredients\" or whatever. Comfort food shouldn't be $10.50+ for a meal where I am left feeling hungry afterwards.  I can't justify going here anymore due to the small portion sizes.  P.S. I am not obese lol",

    "text": "First place that I have had Vietnamese food at since moving to Pittsburgh from California. The food was decent, but not as flavorful or bold as what I am use to. I had the bun bo hue, which made me extremely happy simply because I love this dish back home! The broth did not have any spiciness to it, it was missing the fishy taste made by shrimp paste, and more importantly was missing the slab of PORKS BLOOD; so the dish was sort of disappointing overall. My boyfriend had the combination pho, which he said tasted good, but it was his first time having Viet food so I am not quiet sure if it is as good as he thought it was...I also like the fried banana with coconut milk, but when we went this past weekend bananas were out of season so Pho Van did not have any. The avocado smoothie was also pretty decent, I have been wanting to find a place that has some sorts of boba drinks and Pho Van is one of the few places I have been able to find so far in Pittsburgh. I usually like milk tea drinks with boba, but I settled for avocado because that was the first available boba drink.  Additionally,  the services provided by the servers were really slow. To get the check it took an extra 10-15 minutes after the server took away our bowls. Also, the teapot was never refilled and we did not really feel like waiting even longer so we just stuck with our water even though the tea cost $2.   The overall space for Pho Van is very nice and clean, but the energy of the place is sort of dull and quiet. Its very unlike the Asian restaurants I am use to eating at . It needs more of a upbeat and inviting presence or something. A faster and more efficient services provided by servers, and just overall like homey feel or something.",

I had low expectations because the place did not appear \"fancy\" on the inside, and I'd never been here before. But, this is the best Vietnamese food I've had! Everything was so fresh and tasty, I ordered the shrimp with noodles, and it was better than I've ever had. My brother ordered a pho with many meats in it, and raved about it. Everyone agreed the iced coffee was especially tasty. We were too stuffed to order dessert, but we'll definitely go back! Yum!~",

We had to wait 20-30 minutes for our food to come to our table. No one came to check on us during that time. Our server came about 2 minutes before the food arrived telling us that our food was coming.  The food was ok, too much MSG though. I could feel my mouth and throat really dry when I got home and the day after. I got a pho and my friend got a vermicelli with grilled beef.

The ambiance is kind of blah. It's brightly lit and the tables are pretty plain and it lacks personality. We started with the spring rolls which were very fresh and yummy. They had long strands of lemongrass popping out and the dipping sauce was great. My date ordered their specialty - the pho (pronounced \"fuh\") and I had the lemongrass tofu. I don't eat meat so didn't sample the pho, but he said it was very good. It came in a huge portion with a generous side of sprouts and peppers to add to it. The tofu I ordered was a great consistency, but pretty flavorless. I never salt my food, but this definitely needed something. I used the leftover spring roll sauce to at least season my rice. I understand its not their specialty, but I was kind of disappointed. They were out of most vegetarian options, so hopefully next time I'll have something else to choose from! Great prices and BYOB :)",

PHO TAI ($9.50): I don't have a large appetite and maybe my stomach is just a black hole for noodles, but I really felt that the portion was insufficient. The amount of meat matched the noodles. One of my friends actually ordered extra noodles on the side.. On top of that, the broth didn't warm my soul like pho usually does. We were given appropriate-ish amount of basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos and lime. Moreover, I do like that they have little sauce cups for your hoisin/sriracha dip!  SERVICE: Good. The woman who served us was very nice and accommodating to our group of 9! We went during late evening on a weekend and there were a few other couples there eating.   I would like to note that we did not know we wouldn't be given our checks at the table but we had to go to the register at the front.  ATMOSPHERE: Nothing special, pretty typical of a pho place. The photos (of Vietnam?) on their back wall are quite nice.  Pho Van wasn't a show stopper, but if I can't walk a block to the other pho shop down the street, I guess I'll end up here.",

The broth was not hot and I would say it was lukewarm, for that reason some of my meat remained raw the entire time I ate.

My main squeeze ordered #26, I actually have no idea what it was but I know it was #26 in case you really needed to know. He really enjoyed it and was surprised by the huge portion. I think he assumed it was a smaller wonton soup but he got a big bowl like me! He really enjoyed it all, he said there was so much flavor in it, I think he wished the noodles were more like the pho noodles but he didn't really order pho so that's what he gets! I ordered the vegetarian pho and loved ittttt. I love when Vietnamese places have vegetarian broth even though it is traditionally a beef broth. Thanks for accommodating us vegs. It was a huge bowl with lots of vegetables, noodles, and tofu. It was delicious.  Writing this makes me want more pho.",

I ordered what I usually order at Vietnamese restaurants - shrimp fresh spring rolls and bun bo hue. The spring rolls were delicious and filled generously and I really liked the peanut dipping sauce. I also thought the bun bo hue was really good and a huge portion, probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Their ingredients were really fresh as well. I wasn't a huge fan of their pho broth when I tried a few sips, which was a bit disappointing given that their bun bo hue was so tasty. However, I'll definitely be back for their spring rolls and bun bo hue!",

I wish the shrimp spring rolls had more shrimp (three halves of a shrimp per roll and two rolls in an order) but at $4, it was a good value.    The combination fried rice was different because the meat was served on skewers, but it was good.  Also, the dining room is more welcoming than some of the other Vietnamese restaurants in town.",

I was on a trip with my College to tour the strip district, and I kept telling my friend \"I hope they have a Pho/ Vietnamese restaurant down there so that you can try it\". Behold, the first place in front of us when we stepped off the bus was this amazing restaurant! We were both mind blown!  So we stepped inside, and we were promptly greeted and seated. I showed my friend the different variations of beef and helped her choose what she should order. We both decided on the Well done round eye brisket and after we put our orders in, They came out in no time. The traditional toppings were set aside, and after I doused my bowl with toppings, I was ready to chow down! The broth was so decadent and flavorful! The broth says it all! All the flavors came together, and it was heaven in a bowl. I ate every bit of my Pho down to the last bite! The staff here is friendly and kind, and the prices are awesome! If i'm ever back in Pittsburgh, and I have a taste for Pho. This place will be my go to!",

    "text": "I wish two stars meant \"fair\", because this place is not \"bad\", but it also ain't \"good\".  I will return here, because I have a car that steers itself to the Strip district, and am therefor forced to eat on the Strip at least twice a week.  Ate on a Thursday, about 5:00pm.  One other couple in the place.  First impressions, please spend a couple days, and brighten the place up.  Scrub it down thoroughly, maybe splash on some paint.  It is not dirty, but it is just slightly above dismal.  Needs more light, scrub and wax everything, and that would make the place a whole lot better.    I got the fried rice supreme.  I like rice.  I like fried rice.  I like fried rice that is not greasy, has a good balance of flavor, and has to has to has to have bean sprouts.  The fried rice supreme came with a skewer of about five medium sized grilled shrimp.  Overcooked.  I would guess that they were pre-cooked and then warmed up for the meal.  Same with the pork and chicken.  They all tasted O.K., as in passable, but they also all tasted like they had been cooked before, and were just warmed up and laid down next to the rice before being served.  Not bad, but no excuse for this.  All dried out.  Not happy about that at all.  The rice part of the fried rice was also equally disappointing.  It had a really promising taste at first bite.  Not greasy, nice texture, and a great smoky taste.  but, very few added ingredients.  No bean sprouts, some finely chopped scallion.  But nothing else.  A little bit of finely chopped egg.  Nothing else.  Rice, small amount of scallion, small amount of egg, some smoke seasoning, and the three sides of chicken, pork, and shrimp.  HUGELY disappointing.   I mean, I took the majority of it home, and am looking at it now.  Yep, those were all of the ingredients.  The wife got the bun with pork.  Pretty standard, rice noodles, The rice noodles were not good.  Tasteless, starchy, just not good.  Bean sprouts, juliened carrot and sliced cucumber.  Chopped Romaine lettuce.  and the pork and obligatory fried spring roll.  Now, we had ordered a spring roll as an appetizer, and had to send it back, as we thought it was burnt.  We sent it back. When the spring roll came back, it was just as burnt.  the wife said \"this tastes like burnt oil\".  Duh...  I would bet that the oil the things were cooked in was old.  Same as the spring roll that came with her bun.  Old oil leaves   Now THAT irritated me.  The fillings in the fried spring roll were good, but there are few things as bad as anything that has been cooked in old oil.  The cook is forced to do a balancing act of cooking the thing to the point of doneness, without making the wrapper black to the point where no one would eat it.  The ingredients were good, but the execution was off.  Oh yeah, one last whiny comment, the fish sauce was the cheapest saltiest fish sauce I have EVER had.  I mean, I am not asking for the stuff to be that $50.00 a bottle super delicious fish sauce, but the stuff we got was horrible.  Like they had added salt to the fish sauce, which I know just cannot be the case.  So, just guessing that they use horrible cheap fish sauce.  THIS is the reason folks say they don't like fish sauce.   When it is just salty and plain bad.  Overall, the meal was like eating at a Chinese or mexican restaurant, where they try to target a Midwest .  The only upsaide was the waitress was really nice.  I tipped her well.  I am hoping that if I go back for lunch, maybe it will be better.  If it is, I will update my review, if it isn't, I will say so.  Oh, and I am definitely not going to try the Bhan Mi (Vietneamese sandwich) that they advertise here.  I would be royally torqued off if I waste cash on a Ban Mhi here, when the Vietnamese lady who sells these sandwiches right down the street at the fire station is so close, and sells such flat out delicious vietnamese sandwiches.  She is the best!  (not really, but pretty darn good!).  Overall, I am going to come back, give it another try.  Gonna try the Pho.  Hopefully, it will come out, the broth steaming hot, and a plate full of bean sprouts and basil and lime wedges on the side.  If I get that, I will edit this review, and give glowing remarks.",

We waiting 20 minutes to receive our fresh rolls on a day when there were maybe 3 occupied tables.  The vegetarian summer rolls were tasty but I wish they were rolled tighter.  We had to flag the server down to get more water and, after we had finished our summer rolls, we waited another 15 minutes to get our entrees.  The combination grilled noodle bowls were quite tasty - particularly the beef.  My daughter's boyfriend loved the tofu pho and my daughter seemed to enjoy her tofu noodle bowl.  But, the service was soooo bad.  After we finished our meals, we sat and waited in vain for 10 minutes for someone to even ask us if we needed anything else.  The staff, in the meantime, were sitting down and having a meal at one of the tables or playing on their IPhones while we waited.  Finally, my husband got up from the table and went to the server area and asked for our check.  The only thing that saved this place for me was how good the food was.  I'm on the fence if I'll go back.",

The interior of the building had nice colors and pictures on the walls, but the roof and walls looked pretty old and nasty. There were water stains on the roof, with the tiles completely misaligned. Seeing that kind of stuff makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like. But the bathroom was nicely adorned.

This pho, was very comparable to our local pho that I like to base my opinion off of. It has a delicious broth with some awesome-tasting noodles, although i think that the brisket could've been more plentiful and longer cooked. I also ordered an appetizer: Spring rolls, with bean sprouts, mint leaves, celery, rice noodles, and shrimp, which was all wrapped in rice paper. I really loved the taste of all of those things combined, and the shrimp was cooked very well. Overall, the only thing that was lacking was the amount of brisket in the pho, therefore lowering it to a hint below 5 stars. Eat here everyone!",

The first time I went with a friend who is pretty open minded about food, but neither of us had really experienced Vietnamese food. We were both pleasantly surprised.  We started with the Vietnamese dumplings, which were definitely an experience unlike any food I've ever had before. I'm usually pretty alright eating most things, but I could not stomach even more than one of the dumplings because of the casing, which was extremely chewy and gelatinous. My friend also could not finish hers, and we left the third one on the plate because neither of us would have been able to stomach it.  I ordered the Pho with beef tendons, which I found extremely delicious. Since I had never had pho before, the waitress gladly suggested how to eat it and what I should add. I enjoyed it a lot, and the beef tendons were very good and added a lot of flavor. The bowl seemed pretty big, but I was still hungry afterwards, which is always fine with me in the Strip District.   The next two times I have gone to this restaurant I've had the meat bowls, in both chicken and beef, both of which were extremely enjoyable. The noodles are always very good and the meat is always well seasoned.",

The new thing I tried this time was the durian smoothies.  I thought it was fantastic. Durian might get a bad rap for it's smell but it sure does taste good.  I think they did a good job here with the smoothies. But it did took forever to come.  I was almost done with my entree when it came.  The table I sat at was for two people. Even for two people it was tiny.  The appetizer plate was in the way and took a while for the waiter to take away.  Overall, it still was a good meal.  I would come back.",

I shared beef pho and a pork salad with my friend and loved 100 percent of everything. Loved the freshness of the herbs, the quality of the meat, the flavor in the broth and also the tangy salad dressing.   This kind of restaurant reminds you of how much you can love eating.   The service is quick and I love how they give you a large water bottle so you can fill up your glass by yourself. The restaurant decorations are also artfully done.  The prices are not cheap but are reasonable considering the quality of the food. A great place to go when you are craving Vietnamese food. Would like to try more of their menu next time. :)",

Sadly, because Maiku is the size of a postage stamp in regards to seating, there was a 40m table wait which the hubs was not down for :(   So, we went to my second choice for pho right down the street which is great if you don't have your heart set on your first choice. It has plenty of seating and is always in the top five places for pho in Pittsburgh.   I got the Supreme Pho and the fresh shrimp summer rolls. I've had better fresh shrimp rolls other places. Their shrimp was a little over cooked but the dipping sauce was good. The pho was delicious. I don't think you can go wrong ordering any of their pho options. I wish they had a larger side plate of fresh toppings like jalapenos, bean sprouts and herbs as I could have used more with my pho. The broth is light, filling and not greasy.   Uhmmm, I totally recommend this place if Maiku is too busy to wait. It's still my side place for pho. They don't serve sushi at Pho Van which is what I truly love about Maiku on top of their yummy pho.",

Still, the food is good and satisfies my pho cravings.  The service is attentive and friendly, though, and they get their jobs done. I tend to tip well because the workers are dedicated to their work. My water glass never gets empty.  The menu has undergone slight changes, however I'd come here again.",

Word to the wise, in the Pho the meat is uncooked when it comes out but it cooks in the soup as it is scolding hot. It comes with the broth and meat in the actual soup while the other items are on the side: rice noodles, onions, cilantro, bean sprouts and such.

My friend and I both agreed that the menu was a little confusing to follow in terms of what you could add to the pho and the pricing of it.    * Price vs. Worth: Apparently their prices have increased within the last year or two. My chicken pho was around $10.50 which is the average price in Pittsburgh. I'd be willing to pay that amount for my pho again.  Will I come here again? - Maybe.

There also were many non vegetarian options that looked equally tasty. Great for people who have mixed dietary needs in their friend and/or family group.",

    "text": "Decent Beef broth in the Pho plenty of yummy sprouts on the side, limes and Thai Basil plus fresh cilantro in the Pho. Yes thats thai basil and cilantro in your Pho not Mint. Its the layering of flavors that I love with vietnamese and thai dishes. The spice level is maybe medium but I add a little hot sauce to make mine warmer.   If you like the beef in your Pho pink order the rib eye instead of flank beef and ask for it that way they should be able to accomodate. The beef broth has a simple base here but I like to make my own Pho by adding lime sprouts etc so this works for me. If you like a lot of kick without playing with your food you may not enjoy it as much!  Ive never had slow or bad service here in the couple of times I went and I always get enough PHO for two meals at 7$ for PHO thats a great deal. Spring rolls are ok fresh I did not try the fried ones. They are  different from fresh thai spring rolls so dont be expecting that. I think the decor is fine I mean its a PHO joint not the Westin.   Have you looked around the rest of pittsburgh lately, shit is old and ugly. And there is still beauty in all of that if you want to see it........",

Had hot green tea which came served in a pretty cast iron pot and cups   For lunch had the Pho Chicken (since I was fighting a cold) - the broth lacked a little bit of flavor because it wasn't so salty which I actually really appreciated..the lack of salt was nothing a bit of sirracha couldn't fix :)   Oftentimes Pho broth tastes so good because it is so salty but it leaves you feeling dehydrated and heavy, but this Pho had a nice clean and light balance - I ate my soup and felt good and warm - not like I had overeaten or needed a nap. There was ample chicken and fixings for the soup. Everything was fresh!   One of my coworkers has a vermicelli bowl which looked beautiful - many fresh veggies and fixings. He said it was good, light and fresh too.    Would stop by here again for lunch.  :)",

    "text": "Ok.....there is a decent chance that the cooks at Pho Van are squatters.  At the very least, they aren't too concerned with the \"High School Cafeteria Chic meets Tiki bar meets Semi-Demolished Room\" look.  That's probably because the food is pretty damn good.  I've tangled with Pho before, with Tram's being the big dog on the block.  But Pho Van manages give Trams a run for its money.  If you've read other reviews, you already know the fresh Spring Rolls are amazing.  If not, read those and come back....I'll wait....  That's right....awesome Spring Rolls.  And the peanut sauce is good enough to make you want to lick the bowl.  Portion sizes are big at Pho Van, like so big that they are less trying to satiate your hunger, and more trying to punish you for daring to bring your pathetic appetite into their house o' noodles.  But with nothing on the menu over $9 dollars, you're getting your money's worth times five.  Broth is the key to Pho and Pho Van has some of the best.  My lovely partner is a soup hater to the degree that you'd think it used shove her into a locker in junior high, but even she gave a begruding thumbs up to the broth.  Combine that with dead on perfect noodles, and you've got a meal for a cold, rainy day.  But if glorified noodle soup doesn't get you motor running, you can still get a dirt cheap meal that's 4 star worthy.  While it comes in a bowl, the Grilled selections are all of the tasty bits of a pho bowl, without the sloppy broth (sloppily delicious).  Unlike some other Vietnamese restaurants who make similar entrees, Pho Van keeps the vinegar based sauce on the side, which you'll be thankful for moderation when you get near the bottom of the bowl.  With a prime location in the Strip District, Pho Van has alot going for it.  Now, if someone would explain why there is a tiki awning on a solid wall, inside of the restaurant, it would help me get over the fly by night feel of a restaurant that I hope is here for the long haul.",

    "text": "This place is amazing, especially for vegetarians.  I have been coming here for takeout for the past year, but went with my family for a sit down lunch yesterday afternoon.  First of all, there is no corkage fee which a huge plus in my book.  We started out by ordering the fresh rolls - absolutely amazing.  They are HUGE, and 2 orders was more than enough to feed a family of 5.    For our main dish, my sister, father, and I all had the vegetarian pho (my go-to), and it was incredible as always.  The tofu, vegetables, and broth were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and they gave us a very large plate of toppings for the 3 of us to share.  I'm always amazed at how much food the pho is.  You wouldn't think a bowl of soup would be so filling! My brother ordered the chicken fried rice, which I can't attest to, but I think he was pretty underwhelmed.  I think the vegetarian dishes are really where Pho Van shines.    My mom had the most interesting dish of the group.  Per a friends recommendation, she ordered the fried tofu with rice vermicelli.  It was a cold dish - kind of like a noodle salad, and the tofu was sliced into very thin strips and fried...almost like a tortilla strip.  The tofu in her dish was absolutely amazing.  The sauce and noodles were extremely good and it all went together perfectly.  I will definitely be trying this dish next time I go.  The decor of the restaurant is very minimalist and clean.  Not much to look at, but a comfortable setting nonetheless.    The service was great, as with every other time I've picked up food from there.  All in all a great restaurant that I would highly recommend to anyone craving pho/Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh!",

We have been here about half a dozen times in the past few months and will continue to go back. Nothing fancy about it, but the food is good, the service is quick and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the curry chicken which had good spice and the chicken was cooked well - not gummy. The vegetable summer rolls and the shrimp summer rolls are great and don't fall apart when you eat them!   The portions are manageable but if you order a few appetizers, you may have some left overs. The other day I asked for my soup to go and didn't realize how much was leftover, but I ended up walking out with a quart filled with pho.",

    "text": "We finally made it to Pho Van to use our Groupon, just two days before it expired!  That's how we roll, last-minute style.  We moseyed in on Wednesday around 7 pm - about half the tables were full, and two tables were set up for outdoor dining for those of you who like to people-watch in the Strip District!  We chose a table inside, in the \"spartan\" dining room, as my boyfriend called it.  There isn't really much decor or atmosphere at all - just a simple room with tables and chairs - nothing to focus on but your dining partner and the food!  We ordered the crispy rolls first, which arrived hot and with their texture as advertised.  You can taste the meaty pork inside them!  Then we got bowls of pho - mine with rare eye of round, my boyfriend's with brisket.  My meat did indeed arrive rare and red, but after a few minutes swim in the broth, it continued to cook and developed a more uniform brown color.  The bowls were huge and just full of noodles!  We took a few sips of the hot broth and instantly, any stress or pain melted away.  Wow, that stuff was lovely.  Aromatic, herbal, delightful.  I doctored mine a little bit with basil leaves and bean sprouts, but surprisingly we didn't add any Sriracha at first.  I love spicy food, but the broth tasted so lovely on its own, I didn't feel the need.  We ended up adding some later, which did add a nice kick but it changes the flavor slightly.    The food was so inexpensive - $7 for a giant bowl - we each took half home for lunch the next day.  So that's basically $3.50 per meal.  A steal!  And it was such a pleasure to eat - it was....peaceful food, if that makes any sense.  Our server was also friendly and fast.  We both felt like this was a great use of Groupon - we tried a new place, and liked it enough that we plan to come back!   Everybody wins!",

The 4 star is a really dumb reason, because they have this one American girl working there and I just have a thing about foreign food, I believe it should be served and prepared by the people of that country.

    "text": "In sum, this is my most FAVORITE establishment in PGH for Pho. If you want amazingly tasteful, rich, and consistent pho within the city of PGH eat here!  Granted, if you read my other reviews, I tend to stick with the same appetizer and entree when dining at Vietnamese establishments. Sure, I have delved into the chicken, eye of round, tripe, and other tasty morsels. However, I personally think, regardless of where one eats pho, the beef meatball pho is the most consistent.   Consistency is something I absolutely love about restaurants and this place serves to most consistent, fresh, hot, tasty, affordable, and solid portion sizes of pho in town. *Noteworthy* my observation that portion sizes are smaller for take-out still stands, even for Pho Van. But as I mentioned in my review of Pho Ming this is the general consensus amongst Vietnamese restaurants throughout the PGH area. For reasons, I can only speculate. The serving sizes of the bowls in restaurants is larger than the quart liquid take-out containers can fit.  My favorite appetizer is the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. I've talked before how much the nuoc cham, a Vietnamese traditional dipping sauce, displays unique flavors and tasting depending on the family and region. My all time favorite version can be found here. It seems this sauce is sweeter and spicier than others. Also, the shrimp are larger. Who does not want nice juicy shrimp in their rolls when given the choice? Lastly, they are the only Vietnamese restaurant in our area that tends to not to overcook the shrimp. A subtle difference. I am not saying the other places fry the rolls to bloody hell. However, this place receives Little Red Riding Hood's two thumbs way up of approval.  Second to the consistency of their amazing food, is the added touches. Each and EVERY time I order the beef meatball pho it comes with 2.5 TIMES the amount of fresh herbs than those other places in PGH. I really love this. The fresh herbs can make or break any decent pho broth. Also, they serve it with freshly sliced jalapenos. NOTHING can substitute this heat and fresh green flavor they add- NOTHING. If your stomach cannot handle all the heat, not to worry. Add the jalapeno, but only for a minute or so, then remove it. I noticed it adds only a little heat instead of the intense blows that I am fond of.  Enjoy!",

We were visiting Pittsburgh and were not familiar with the area, so we couldn't really gauge whether the restaurant was our type of restaurant. We decided to try this restaurant because we really wanted pho.   When we entered the restaurant, we realized that it wasn't our type of restaurant, given the demographic. My boyfriend wanted to leave but I was hungry, so he had to resort to eating there. There were 2 waiters (well, one looked like he was just hanging out) and 1 waitress. The restaurant was semi-filled but there was a line. Not really sure what the problem was.   After we were seated, we waited for 5-10 minutes before the waitress came over to take our order. We ordered our usuals - pho and summer rolls. We wanted to get the spring rolls but we saw that it was just two tiny rolls for $4 (totally not worth it). We waited for a while before we got our food; two customers, who came after us, got their pho before we got ours. I also want to point out that my boyfriend had to ask about our food before they brought it over. Everything was just slow - it didn't help that they brought one bowl of pho at a time. Weird.   Now the food -  Pho - not great, but decent Bean sprouts were old No basil  Spring rolls - decent; I was happy it was fresh.  Sauce - watery (I noticed later that the customers' next to us had better sauce)  Price - pho was priced higher than the standard price",

We ordered the spring rolls which were decent and I ordered the meatball pho. From the past pho places that I have been to, I have been given bean sprouts however at Pho Van there was none - just some leafy greens and jalapenos on the plate. The meatballs and noodles were good though I wasn't a fan of the broth, which seemed to have more seasoning and spices than I was use to. Service was nice though ultimately I don't think I would go back unless someone wanted to go.",

I'm used to Boston pho, but when I really need to get my fix I'll come here.  The cuts of meat are reasonably generous and there are more noodles than soup, which is what I'd prefer in order to be full.  Service is efficient. There was one time I came here on a rainy day and they ran out of fresh herbs and bean sprouts, which sucked... But the soup still tasted good without them.",

Fortunately it was not expensive at all.  The fresh and crispy spring rolls were fantastic, and the service was great.  I dont have anything bad to say about this place, but it was not outstanding.",

Tender and full of flavor, just like a good steak.   The only negatives was that there wasn't a ton of meat and the garnishes lacked cilantro, although cilantro was in the soup itself. I would also have like 1-2 more lime slices.  Just a smidge pricey but fair prices nonetheless. Awesome Pho if that's what you're looking for.",

I'm ashamed to admit I didnt realize it wasn't what I ordered until 5 minutes into eating it. Still it was very delicious and honestly I probably liked the pork more than I would have liked the chicken.   Service was quick, friendly, efficient, and my first experience with Vietnamese pork was a good one.

    "text": "Pho Van rocks!  Not sure what's up with other reviews, but I've been there several times and it's my favorite Pho in the city (thought I've not tried them all, yet). I guess it's a \"your mileage may vary\" kind of thing.  Went for a quick lunch and got the standard Pho with rare eye round beef on the recommendation of the waitress. It comes out in usual fashion, with a steaming broth, and the basil leaves, sprouts, lime and jalapenos on a side dish. \"Just let me know if you want more veggies\" said the waitress. We're off to a good start.  The Pho had thin slices rare beef on top of the noodles, as advertised, and it slowly cooked to a very tender doneness from the heat of the broth.   And the broth....  That's what it's all about with Pho, and this is just right in my opinion. Really flavorful, without being over-seasoned, a hint of anise and when you add the jalapeno slices, the flavors just come together perfectly.   This is a place I need to bring my veggie spouse, I thought and I asked to see the menu again. No veggie Pho on the menu. I asked. \"oh yes, we have a great veggie Pho\" she said, \" just ask for it.    I snuck away for another lunch, with the same happy result. Next would be a trip to try the veggie Pho.   So, now my wife has what is possibly her favorite Pho. Not just in Pittsburgh either (we lived in Boston for years, so take that for what it's worth).   Really, the veggie Pho is very, very good. The broth is not trying to emulate a beef or pork-based broth, but rather stands on its own as one of the best veggie broths either of us can remember. Let me take that back. One of the best broths we've had, veggie, or otherwise. And with the addition of the basil, sprouts, jalapenos and lime, just another level from what you'd expect.   Everyone who likes Pho, will have their favorite. This is ours, and by a big margin.   Caveats, haven't been there for dinner, haven't been there when it's super busy, haven't ordered anything but he Pho. Still, sticking with my 5-star.",

    "text": "Pho is a curious thing. I haven't had it too, too many times, and I only had it for the first time fairly recently. Wherever I have had it, well, it's all tasted the same to me...but all of that pho was agreeable to my flavor receptors.     After work the other night, as I marched down Penn Avenue towards Altar Bar to catch Egyptodeath metal masters Nile in concert, I felt my innards grumble. I recalled that there is a Vietnamese restaurant on Penn Avenue in the Strip District that I had yet to try, and before I realized it, there I was in front of it, Pho Van.  When I arrived, I was lightly damp with sweat and militantly garbed in a black Machine Head tour shirt and brown work pants. I peeked my head into the modern, elegantly simple dining room, subconsciously, self-consciously wondering if I was \"acceptable,\" but when I cautiously made my way inside, a crew of young men jumped up, scurried about, and seated me immediately.   Despite feeling warm from the muggy walk, I did in fact order the Pho Chin. I heard the sole other diner--a fellow who arrived after I did--mention to the server that \"it's too hot out for soup,\" but that did not affect my enjoyment. This was the living, steaming epitome of comfort food, chicken soup's Vietnamese counterpart if you will. The broth was cloudless and subtly flavorful. The shaved flaps of  \"well-done brisket\" swam amongst scallions, bean sprouts, and other veggies, all of them imbibed with the essence of the broth and tangled in the satiny spiderweb of squishy noodles.  If I did have a complaint, it would be that the meat was arguably overcooked. Not that it was inedible, but I think I would have liked to have seen and tasted a touch of pink amidst the grey. Overall, this light dinner satisfied my hunger and was exactly the kind of thing I was looking for prior to attending the frenzied musicale down the road.    As I dined, a fellow metallion--short and stocky in stature, long, blonde hair, clad in a sleeveless Slayer shirt and cut-off fatigues, resembling a band member as much as he did a mere fan--warily looked in.  He spotted me, nodded to me, intuitively knowing that I  was musically kindred, and asked \"Hey man, is the food good here?\"  \"Yeah, man, it's a-ight.\"  \"They got crab rangoon?\"  \"Nah, I don't think they do.\"  \"Aw man,\" he said, dismissively waving his hand, \"I'm gettin' some Primanti's then. Yer goin' to Nile, right?\"  \"Yeah, I'll be there. I'm headin' down after I eat,\" I responded, chuckling.  \"A-ight dude, later.\"   And with a throw of the horns, my unnamed acquaintance jogged off into the sweltry night as I tilted the soup bowl towards my mouth to finish off the remaining broth. After paying my tab and speaking with the server about pho and Yelp for a few minutes, it was off to Altar Bar for an evening of barks, bellows, blastbeats, bruising guitars, and bludgeoning bodies.",

Umm I agree! but you need to understand LA and Pittsburgh are worlds away in terms of having the cultural diversity... Pho Van comes close.. I wouldn't compare them to LA Pho Places.   My review of the food. I always have Pho Ga, (chicken). The broth was good and the ingredients were really fresh. Did it taste as good as Pho in Los Angeles? No. Was it better then other places? Yes. Florida in my opinion has some of the worst pho i have ever had! plenty of chicken, so they didnt skimp.   additionally the fresh shrimp rolls were great.   fyi.. if you want AMAZING pho and in LA... check out Glendale Pho Co. in Glendale, CA",

    "text": "This was my second experience with Vietnamese food. About a month prior to coming here, a group of friends went down the street to Vietnam's Pho.  This was probably very unfortunate for Pho Van because their food was seriously lacking in dimension and flavor in comparison.  The service was also pretty lackluster.  A number of us ordered shrimp rolls -fresh or fried - and the waitress seemed very confused about who ordered what and originally brought out enough app plates for us, but then walked away still carrying two of them.  When I asked her for them, she handed them over, then came back with two more plates that we didn't need.  The fresh rolls were pretty good - not the best I've ever had, but not bad.  The fried rolls were about half the size of the fresh ones, and the couple that ordered them felt pretty jipped.   Our Pho's and soups came out without any event, but the add-ins that came with it was pretty lack-luster in variety.  The broth itself was pretty bland, which made for a bland dish.   We went in a large group and asked for separate checks, but there was a bit of confusion about how this worked.  The waitress didn't really explain what to do very well.  After waiting for about 20 min for our check and seeing no signs of our waitress, we asked another waitress for our checks.  She came back promptly to inform us that if we were paying separately we needed to do all of that at the register.  Once we got that straightened out, the actual check-out process was quick and painless.   Bottom line - if you're in the strip and want Vietnamese, go a few blocks down to Vietnam's Pho.",

I never thought I would ever say this for a Bussiness ever but I am forced to say this I was there last night with a group of friends for dinner but the food was exceptionally terrible I mean before I had to throw up even before I could reach home and I live 10 mins away from the spot only to found out on yelp that someone had a bug on their bowl! Like what?!?!? I ordered the shrimp vermicelli bowl the shrimp was supposed to be grilled it was so rubbery and wayyy over cooked and it had zero flavor there was something weird about the sauce it came with it smelled gross( don't get me wrong I have had enough Vietnamese food to know the difference between a good sauce and a sauce that smells suspicious) I couldn't eat more than two bites. My husband ordered the shrimp fried rice the shrimp was just like mine and the fried rice was gross it was stale and a smell to it. My husband woke up middle of the night with serious stomach ache from the food. The bean sprouts they gave were really old and brown. Never ever going back their. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!",

    "text": "I am a Pho fan, like the taste and freshness of the dish. As always I ordered a Pho Ga, the place looks nice. Time was taken to decorate and create a good atmosphere. Based on my other Pho experienced across the country this one certainly scored a 3 stars. Everything is as it should be. Although it is the first time I needed to add some salt to the broth. But that cN be a personal preference.   As you can see I'm only giving it 1 star (first one ever), might be confusing based on my review above. Well, let me explain why this place lost 2 stars in the world of yelp.  As I finished my Pho I noticed a beetle crawling on the plate beneath my bowl. Looked like a voluptuous pantry pest. I'm not an expert but that's the best way to describe it. I pointed it out to the waiter with the comment:\" you might want to point this out to your boss in the kitchen, it's not the most appetizing scenario\" he giggled and walk away. My intention was to point out to the owner the possibility of a bug infestation. Wasn't looking for a reimbursement, more of a acknowledgement from the owner. To my surprise neither the owner or the waiter made ANY type of comment. The waiter made my bill total known from behind the counter and wished me a good day.   So be aware of a possible bug infestation at this place. Might want to keep an eye out for floating black grains in your Pho. These pantry pest normally feed on dry food like pasta, rice, ...",

    "text": "I really wish the inside matched the outside here. It looks like a very sleek little place to eat Pho on the outside but it's not matched on the inside as others have stated.   There is minimal decor inside and it doesn't really feel inviting. It's just very boring inside and although it doesn't effect the food, it hurts the experience. It was also super cold inside, and being that it was a cold day I would have thought it would be warmer. All I wanted was a warm place and soup! Only got half of that deal.   The food is very good and comes out very quick. We had less than an hour to eat and we were in and out of there in 30 minutes! We had crispy rolls for an appetizer which were good but small. Probably about 1/3 of a \"normal\" eggroll size. I had the chicken rice bowl which is rice noodles, grilled chicken, veggies, and a sauce that you pour onto it before you mix it up. The chicken wasn't the best but everything else in the bowl was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken pho and he really enjoyed it. The pho come with veggies on the side so you can really customize it to your liking. Add a little sriracha and your good to eat!   Overall this place is good, not my favorite, but if I am ever in need of pho in the strip I most likely will stop here!",

    "text": "During college, I was fortunate enough to work at a Vietnamese restaurant and develop a deep appreciation for Pho. I usually go to Pho Van to fulfill my Pho cravings but after my last trip, I am going to explore other options. I am not ruling Pho Van out and I acknowledge that every restaurant has an off day but the service and flavor solidified my 3 star rating. I came by myself during lunch on a Friday. It was a chilly day and I knew Pho would hit the spot. I started with fresh shrimp rolls. They are a staple at most Thai/Vietnamese restaurants and they are my favorite appetizer. Pho Van's are delicious and will continue to order these everytime I go back. As my main course, I ordered the veggie pho with steamed instead of fried tofu. Usually, the broth has great flavor and I don't need to add anything other than the basil, jalapeno & bean sprouts that come with the dish. Unfortunately, the broth was bland and desperately needed Sriracha. The veggies were skimpy, too. Bok choy, carrots, a few mushrooms and the tofu. No broccoli and the bowl was majority noodles and broth. My waiter was friendly and service was fast but I wasn't approached once during my meal to ask if everything was okay. Granted, I was working on paperwork but as a former server, I found the lack of interaction disappointing.   Like I said, I am not blacklisting Pho Van but I am looking forward to experiencing the other Vietnamese restaurants around Pitt.",

    "text": "Finally! Found a decent pho place in Pgh.  After \"Tram's Kitchen\" and \"Vietnam's Pho,\" I thought my search for good pho would be as dismal as my search for good Korean food in Pgh.  Food (8.5/10) = certainly not the best pho, but it's good enough to satisfy future cravings. Ordered the following dishes:  Appetizers =  1) Shrimp spring rolls ($4) = bottom line, fresh ingredients.  That's all you need to make these things taste great.  F-R-E-S-H ingredients.  You get two of these rolls, and they are relatively big.  Love it.  It will be my ritual to order these bad boys each time I visit Pho Van. 2) Beef stew with toasted French baguette ($7) = Wow.  Last time I had this dish was when I still lived in Atlanta, frequently visiting the Vietnamese saturated Buford Hwy.  This dish was spicy.  It was flavorful.  It contained chunky blocks of beef and carrots, topped with chopped cilantro just before serving.  Accompanying this soup is toasty French bread, the same kind they use to make banh mi.   To be a pro at eating this dish, use the bread to make sure you get every last drop of soup, absorbing all of the rich flavors.  This is the perfect dish to eat during cold weather.     Main Event =  1) Pho w. 3 choices of beef ($8.95) = I chose rare eye round, well done flank, and beef meatballs; other options include beef tendon, beef tripe, and well-done brisket.  So what makes pho great?  Pho is great when all of the components make love to each other in your bowl of course.  However, for this love making to occur, there must be a strong foundation, and that is the broth.  Without it, there will be no harmony.  There will be no greatness.  There will be...NO pho.  At Pho Van, the broth is good, and as such \"chika chika yea yea\" will happen in your bowl.  Ambiance (8.0/10) = spacious, clean.  Cool bamboo decor on the wall.    Service (7.5/10) = pretty standard pho service.  Attentive service, and food came out quickly.  Overall opinion = This place is certainly not serving outstanding pho, as can be found in Houston, Atlanta, Philly, etc.  However, it's certainly good enough for me.  I've already visited Tram's Kitchen and Vietnam's Pho, because they had more/better reviews on Yelp.  Unfortunately, I experienced so-so meh Pho at these two places.  So at least for now, Pho Van is the best place to get Pho in PGH.  \"Chicka chicka yea yea\" - Fogell, from Superbad",

After eating at Penn Avenue Fish Company one afternoon, I found that I was still hungry and decided to stop in for some pho.

They really should put this item on the menu. I tried the regular broth and it is not as flavorful as the spicy base. I do wish that there had been more seafood present to balance out the price of the bowl, but overall it was a good experience.",

You can be as adventurous (tripe) or as tame (chicken/beef) as you'd like. The broth is so incredibly flavorful and paired with the basil, noodles and bean sprouts...YUM.
