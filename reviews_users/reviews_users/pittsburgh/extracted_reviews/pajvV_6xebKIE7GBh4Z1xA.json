The Braddock Smash is a fantastic cocktail. The lobby/lounge area that is shared with the hotel is really epic. Definitely one of the best spots in the city in terms of outrageous use of marble to tip folks off to the amount of wealth that used to be concentrated in the area. I'll definitely be back for a drink and hopefully dinner next time.",

As fries, they were ok... Not good, not bad. The steak was cooked medium as ordered and was good, but was overpowered by some brown sauce. I'm a steak purist and believe a good cut can stand on it's own with little more than salt and pepper. This would have been better without the sauce.  Overall I give it a c+ or b-.  The short rib pierogies sound interesting. We had a groupon otherwise I would have preferred 6 Penn. At least they had east end brewing on tap.  I will give this place another try in the future.",

    "text": "I have to say the food was good, but with any dining experience the server has a lot to do with it. We made reservations for 6 for my sister's birthday and advised we were bringing a small cake and the hostess stated that was not a problem. We arrive on time and were seated promptly at 7. There was only one other party in the restaurant, but for a Tuesday night in Pgh I didn't think much of it. I asked the hostess if she could put our cake in the freezer since it was an ice cream cake and she happily agreed and took it. Five minutes later our waitress comes back with the cake and states that \"they have a policy at Braddock's that no one can bring in a cake or wine and if they do they are charged $15 for Braddock's to hold it kinda like a corking fee\". I have been to several BYOB restaurants and I understand the corking fee. The waiters open the wine for you, pour it, and keep it on ice if necessary. Not the case with a BIRTHDAY CAKE.  After dinner she brought the cake out and placed in on the table in front of my sister, the birthday girl, and did not even take it out of the box. So what was the $15 fee for exactly? She did not serve us; she literally walked 10 steps to the kitchen and brought it out. I guess we were paying their electricity bill since they put it in the freezer four and hour? I will never enter this horrid establishment again. As someone who works in the downtown area and frequents restaurants for working lunches and dinners I was hoping I could add Braddock's to my list of go to spots, sadly it has ended up in my I rather eat fast food then ever eat here again category.  Lastly, the whole time we were there (2.5 hrs) only four other people came in the restaurant. So it can't be just us that figured out this place needs new management asap!",

Their runners don't time the food right and even the waiter/waitress that waits on you doesn't even remember who ordered what. They call this place an American brasserie but this is fake French at best, and even that is a bit of an insult if you'd ask a French chef to taste their food. Don't get me wrong.  The food here is good, but thats the problem - It's not 'excellent' , 'mouthwatering' or 'to die for'. It's just ok good.  It's not worth what they charge, and if you're looking for good French, this place definitely isn't it.  With that being said, the ambiance and decor are superb. The mixed drinks are tasty and they don't jip you on the alcohol.  I suppose I expected a lot more out of a restaurant in the upscale Renaissance Hotel near the theatres, where a lot of out-of-towers may frequent. Surely, you wouldn't want this place to showcase Pittsburgh.",

We ordered champagne and she overfilled one glass and tried to make a joke about it but didn't clean it up.  When she refilled our glasses she commented that she should probably walk around instead of reaching across but instead she reached across the table and dripped water from the outside of the bottle all over the table, on our bread and butter.  I commented that maybe she should wrap the bottle in a napkin and she said \"Oh yea I should\".  The food was very good, soup, salad and entree were all good and nicely presented.  The server needs a lot of training!  The next morning we did not eat there but as we left I noticed that the hostess was dressed in dark jeans and a plaid shirt, very unprofessional for a hotel of this caliber.",

    "text": "Hit or Miss? I've been here about 4 times in the last year, equally split with good and not so good, both in food and/or service. If there's a show that night, the place is busy, if it is a weekend, the place is busy. If it is a random Tuesday at 6:00, you might be the only people there. The specialty cocktails, albeit $10 are really wonderful, the Braddock Smash and Braddock's Revenge w jalapeno are our top 2.  The bread they deliver is hot and crusty served with sea salt topped butter - can't ever go wrong there. Mussels are good, they come with crusty bread for the leftover broth. As for the beet/goat cheese salad, the 1st 2 times it was amazing, last time the beets were undercooked and the greens weren't dressed enough. But each time the fried goat cheese is the highlight! I've had steak & frites, spot on, tender and the sauce complimented it well. I've has the lobster gnocchi twice, generous hunks of lobster in a cream sauce with peas and asparagus, it's really, really, really good. I recommend a half order with a salad :)  We've tried the ribeye, it was okay, it did take forever to come out. Last visit the sea scallops - were great portions and the polenta was yummy, but the scallops had a metallic taste, they brought a 2nd order, also metallic taste, also lacked that crust that a seared scallop should have. From home cooking scallops we have learned that all scallops are not equal and some come treated with STP a chemical preservative added to fresh scallops on the boat. Frozen scallops or 'dry' scallops do not have this added and will not pull a metallic taste. Sometimes people without sensitive tongues might not even notice a difference. STP also causes a scallop to absorb more water, hence losing the ability to get a crust. Really though, you can't blame it on the chef. It's the scallops fault, or whoever the supplier is.   All in all, we won't stop going, it is a pleasant atmosphere, convenient to everything downtown and generally a great experience! I'd still recommend it to friends.",

    "text": "After laboring over the mouth watering menu for 20 minutes trying to narrow down our choices, my normally decisive wife and I gave up, and ordered all appetizers so we could try more things.  We went with the Braised Short Rib Pierogies, Roasted Beet and Fried Goat Cheese Salad with Seared Salmon, Home Made Meatballs stuffed with Provolone and Mozzarella, and Seasonal Wild Mushroom Risotto.  It was all delectable, freshly, and attractively prepared, and every bit as delicious as it sounds.    Besides getting to try more things, the appetizers were a good deal.  The small plate apps and salads are mostly around $10, while the main courses are mostly $30-$35.  Everything was excellent and felt like we got a very fair value.    I should caution any would be dieters that most of the dishes tended to be on the heavier side.  Granted we brought it on ourselves with the cheese stuffed meatballs and short rib pierogies, but in truth most of the menu wasn't stingy with batter, bacon, cheese, sausage, butter, cream, and Bearnaise sauce.  If you're trying to avoid a post meal coma, you may have a hard time finding anything sin free.  That said, if you are up for an indulgence (Because let's face it, you've earned it) you'll have a hard time treating yourself better than Braddocks!",

Mains were the hanger steak, entree portion of crab cakes and a spinach salad with grilled chicken.  Seriously, both orders of the hanger were cooked to order (med-rare) and delicious. The crab cakes with lovely glazed carrots. Spinach salad/chicken very good. Only fuss, too many fries with the steak. Very good fries but too, too many. Overall, the prices for the generous portions very, very good. Service was super!!! Thank you Michelle!!! Cheers to the chef!!! Big plus besides the food, service & price is the atmosphere. Gorgeous hotel, a gem. The decor, marble & stairs in the lobby incredible. Was nice, we got a table that gave us a view of the lobby. Loved that tables well spaced, no loud music, TV's.

Our server was fantastic and we really enjoyed the food and drink, but two of our group members ended up with food poisoning (we think that it was the mussels) after our meal.  We opted to do a mix of plates including their jumbo lump crab cake, braised short ribs pierogies, arancinis. potato gnocchi & lobster, and the mussels.  Overall, during the meal - I enjoyed all of the food with my favorite being the lobster gnocchi and the arancinis were a bit bitter from the port wine.    We also tried a smattering of their drinks from the Braddock's smash to the moscow mule and prohibition pear martini.  They also have a make your own manhattan option.  For a hotel restaurant, this was a really great option inside of The Renaissance which is eclectically upscale.  If it wasn't for the food poisoning, this review would be four stars.",

    "text": "I am rounding down from 3.5 here. This place is somewhat overrated--maybe a place to impress a date or perhaps an expense account dinner. But while I would eat here again, I would not choose to eat here again.  First, Braddock's is a bit pricey and some of the appetizer portions are much smaller than you would expect for the price. Second, there is a large selection of entrees and as a restaurant in a higher-end hotel there is the requisite elegance. Third, the salads and bread are great and they are food allergy friendly. Finally, the entrees are ok at best. Some of the dishes try too hard and are overly complicated which is not always a good thing.  Overall, however, I prefer Alihan's across the street for what I think is consistently better food at a much lower price (which also includes a free glass of wine).",

They brought me complementary fresh baked bread with some unsalted butter with some sea salt on top. Very nice! Had the half portion of mussels as an appetizer which was well done except only a little broth at the bottom making it hard to dip. The broth was awesome for bread sopping.  I would award another star except my main dish of Lobster Cassoulet had overcooked lobster. Basically all claw meat which was chewy.  Service is good, and I think things are actually fairly priced (website menu is accurate). Parking was a little tricky, I ended up at the garage across the street.",

Second, sadly: the food is really, really good, but largely overshadowed by their insane wine prices (for non-drinkers, this place is the real deal.)  Third, noise from the hotel lobby is constant and invasive, and particularly bad on the evening I dined here because a wedding had spilled over into the public areas.  Finally, what they call kielbasa is a big hot dog (the best I ever tasted, prepared perfectly and served with great mustard and kraut, but NOT kielbasa).  I know, I know, technically the term kielbasa can refer to damn near any sausage, but as a Polish American I know that what I was served was NOT kielbasa - delicious, but taking the argument to its extreme, I'd also be pissed off if I ordered a slice of pie and got a bowl of bread pudding (even if it was the best bread pudding ever.)",

They have excellent beers on tap including some local brews in addition to Victory and....wait...is that Merry Monks on tap!? Oh boy. Looking over both the bar menu and the Braddock's restaurant menu, I decided to keep it simple and get their burger with bacon. Very good.   When the bartender, who as first seemed a little grumpy, asked me if I wanted another round, I told him I wanted a Victory. For some reason, he accidentally poured another Merry Monks, realized his error and was going to dump it. I almost had a heart attack and quickly told him to stop, refusing to witness such a tragedy. So, he ended up giving it to me for free. Thank you very much, sir!",

The menu was pretty cool as it showcases Pittsburgh's contribution to the Whiskey Rebellion and gave facts on the different types of whiskeys. I had a glass of white wine and j and I shared the cheese platter. For dinner, J had steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes and I had the jumbo lump crab cakes. Everything was pretty tasty.

    "text": "Color me unimpressed on almost every level.  Came here for Saturday brunch with reasonably high hopes because we were staying in the attached Renaissance hotel. The menu sounded good and with limited promising brunch options in downtown Pittsburgh, I was happy to give it a shot.  The trouble began almost immediately, when we had to wait almost 10 minutes for a table despite the restaurant being not that busy. It was just...bizarre.  When we finally did sit down we ordered two orange juices, which tasted quite clearly like the bottled stuff you can buy at any airport, and ordered our food.  It took about 35 minutes for them to cook up a stack of lemon ricotta pancakes, two scrambled eggs and an omelette. Again, the restaurant was not busy. It took another 10 minutes and two separate requests of two different waiters to procure a bottle of hot sauce. And this was perhaps Braddocks' foremost issue: every member of their small army of employees seemed more interested in marching around the restaurant with important-looking faces and empty hands than of actually doing, you know, things.  All would have been forgiven had the food been wonderful, but it was just plain meh. My eggs looked and tasted like they had taken a nap before coming to the table. Pancakes were dry. Omelette was nothing special. I could have easily cooked up tastier food in my own kitchen. The food alone was probably 2.5 stars. Combined with the service, the total experience was more like 1.5",

I ordered the cheese board and my boyfriend ordered the \"Strip District\" mussels and frites. The mixed berry compote served with the board was phenomenal when paired with one of the spicy cheeses.

Especially for a hotel restaurant!  I think a lot of people have a common misconception that all hotel restaurants must be a chain of some sort.  It's nice that the Renaissance welcomes them in.   The outer part of Braddock's is just a bar area or \"Braddock's Streetside.\"  The back part of Braddock's is a fancy dining room.  It's really quite gorgeous inside.  I couldn't pass up a tasty looking beet salad so I ordered one up.  It's a beautiful presentation with two unassuming fried goat cheese balls.  But holy crap were those some amazing balls!!  The beets were good, don't get me wrong... and I liked shallot vinaigrette, but those cheese balls... star of the show!    I'd come back just for a plate full of those, even though I know it wouldn't be the healthiest option!  I definitely want to come back for dinner and get some of the other delicious sounding items and perhaps a cocktail.  It would be a nice date night spot.  Maybe even a romantical evening stay downtown at the hotel as well!  Fried cheese balls included in that package please!",

After going through the list of restaurants we decided on Braddock's American Brasserie. The staff contacted me that day to confirm my reservations and was very helpful on the parking for the restaurant; they actually cover the valet parking should you decide to utilize it otherwise there is a garage across the street.   The menu was very delightful as the choices of unusual dishes along with the standards which you would expect. The Chef's specials for the evening included a scallop dish which is my wife's favorite and a venison dish which for me peaked my interests. I have only had venison at a namely Pittsburgh restaurant and wasn't impressed by the dish. We started the meal with a couple gasses of wine and an appetizer special of lobster perogies (I'm a Burgh guy) which were delicious and just the right amount to share between my wife and I. My wife had the scallops which was cooked to perfection and delectable (yes we always share). I had the venison which to my surprise was done to perfection and served over a bed of beans and sauce that you had to dabble each bite of venison into appreciate all the flavors. The meat just fell apart as it was so tender and juicy. This is a must if you ever get the chance to be presented with the special do not pass it up. For our dessert we enjoyed a wonderful mix of berries, cinnamon ice cream and granola, yummy! The chef was nice enough to come out and ask how our meals were as he went from table to table making sure everyone was satisfied. He was so enjoyable to speak with as he explained how he made the venison so tender and juicy while giving it so much flavor.   I would recommend this restaurant as the food was wonderful, the entire staff was great and the atmosphere was perfect for our Friday night out!",

We decided on dinner here based on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, what a deal it was!   To start we ordered the wild mushroom rice balls, braised short rib pierogies, and an order of the gnocchi with creamed leeks, Gorgonzola, and lobster. The gnocchi was the best I have ever tasted. The lobster was tender and there was a ton of it, and the sauce was addicting. It was the perfect dish. I could have lived without the short rib pierogies, they weren't great, and the short ribs seemed to be overcooked. The rice balls were pretty good!  Next, was soup. We got the French onion and tomato bisque. French onion was amazing, the tomato soup on the other hand was awful. We didn't touch it. Our waiter was kind enough to even take it off our bill.  For my entree I ordered the sea scallops with sweet corn. It different from the menu I saw online but I was able to change it to my preferences. The entree portion had a whopping 8 scallops on one plate. I was in shock. That is a massive portion, especially at $28. The scallops were cooked perfectly and everything that accompanied it was delicious. My family seemed to enjoy their meals as well, but I was too busy enjoying my scallops to really be sure.  Cocktails were strong, service (even though my brother-in-law scared the waiter) was great, and the food was good. I'd visit again when in Pitt.",

The architecture of the building that holds the restaurant is also worth checking out. I will be getting frites next time so I don't have to steal my sisters.

The drinks menu was awesome, and the drink I had was great. I liked the butcher paper on the tables, and the waiter was really nice. He was great about answering my questions, and even helped me decide between two dishes that sounded good.  I ultimately went with the lobster gnocchi, and the full serving was actually a huge plate of food. The gnocchi was nice (not the lightest gnocchi I have ever had, but pretty good), and the lobster was cooked well. The sauce was quite rich and decadent, and after a few bites, it was feeling like it needed some acid or lightness. I think a small side salad with a tangy vinaigrette would have been nice to add to the dish.  I did take a go-box home, so I ended up getting 1.5 meals out of this, actually.  One of the other diners had the pork and beans, and it looked and smelled amazing. I would go for that the next time I go.  A tip about parking: if you ask the waiter, they will validate your valet parking if you eat at the restaurant. I really appreciated that, because it's a difficult area to park in, especially if there is a game going on.",

    "text": "My wife and I just got into town following a five-hour drive and were looking for a place to have dinner after checking into our hotel. We found this place on Open Table and figured we'd give it a try. It is off the lobby of the the Renaissance Hotel, and at 6:00 on a Tuesday the place was nearly deserted, so we were a little concerned. But in the end it was a great choice. We had a white wine by the glass, and the barrel aged Manhattan with house-smoked vermouth and whiskey-soaked cherries. For an appetizer we had the the kielbasa board -- which included an outstanding and surprising sweet relish made with fresh blueberries, blackberries, and diced beets. For the entree, we both had the evening's special, which was halibut on a bed of arugula, grilled heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fingerling potatoes and a dressing that defied description; it was all very inspired and creative. For dessert, we had the berry cobbler and the brownie, the latter of which came layered with charred marshmallow creme, vanilla ice cream, walnuts and bananas with a burnt-sugar crust. Everything -- the food, the service, the ambiance -- was outstanding. At the end of our meal our server went and got a local map, and took the time to give us some hints about places to see and how best to get around town. As we were leaving, there was live music in the hotel lobby, so we stopped to sit and listen for a while. All in all it was a wonderful night to have after a long drive.",

I had a salad with beets and goat cheese.  I also wanted an appetizer size crab cake.  Our server suggested getting it on top of the salad.  Perfect!  I was in heaven.  The crab cake melted in my mouth.  The goat cheese was different than I thought it would be.  There were two little goat cheese \"cakes\" for lack of a better name.  They were dusted in something and sauteed, so the goat cheese was ever so warm.  Delicious.  All in all a satisfying pre-show dinner. Not too heavy, and very satisfying.  I'll be back.",

The food was average at best, portions were Cheesecake Factory 'esque, the Charcuterie plate looked like someone dumped a pile of cold cuts right out of the package onto a cutting board, no care given to the presentation of food whatsoever.

I had the fish and chips ($13), the Braddocks ($11) burger and the cheese burger ($9). I also tried the Brushchetta ($7), and the fried zucchini. Overall my pick was the Braddocks burger as it contained beef bacon (like a juicy beef jerky), and a relish salsa. I was not a fan of the fish and chips at all. The Brushchetta was the best item I ate there is is probably the best Brushchetta I have ever had. I considered bumping the place up a star because of this, but since its just an appetizer, it gets less weight. Let me put it this way - I wouldn't eat here without the discount.   You get a good amount of food, but you pay for it. Service was pretty good each time.

    "text": "Had high hopes for Braddock's as I had dined here once before and had a great experience.  Their bourbon list is great, and their dessert (a berry crisp with cinnamon ice cream) was delish.  Otherwise we were disappointed.  First disappointment was that I had reserved a booth only to find out when we got there and they brought us to a regular table that they did not reserve one for us.  The food was not great this time either - may have been rushed in the kitchen as it was a busier night.  The waiter talked me out of the ribeye steak that I had last time saying that the pork chop blows it out of the water.  I went for it thinking it would be similar to the amazing pork chop that Casbah serves.  It was ok - very tender (almost too tender), but did not like the flavor combination.  My father-in-law ordered the kielbasa platter and the kielbasa came out dry and the mustard had literally crusted over and hardened a bit to the plate.  When he asked for new mustard and showed the plate to the waiter, he didn't even offer to get a fresh one, but instead asked which mustard he would like brought as a side.  He needed all of them because obviously the plate was made up way too early and they were literally hardened onto the board.  Yuck!  The beet salad was good, but I'd call it a salad with a little beet added rather than a beet salad.  When it comes out you can't even see that there are beets there, they are just a thin layer at the bottom.  Would order this again because it was quite good, but not what you are expecting when you order beets.  My mother-in-law had the fish special and it was awful.  She didn't even eat it.  My husband ordered the salmon and it was ok, but smothered in a sauce that we did not like.  If we go back it will probably just be for drinks and dessert!  The atmosphere is amazing - love the looks of this place.  The wait staff is pretty good as well.  The entrees really are the disappointing part which is a shame because this restaurant has so much potential!  I'd recommend better/fresher ingredients so that everything doesn't have to be covered in a heavy sauce.  A few tweaks and I think this could be a great spot!",

Planned on ordering the Trenne Carbanera listed on their website but it was mysteriously absent from the menu upon arriving. Prices and descriptions are slightly off on several instances as well. Decided to go with the Amish Chicken and my date had the Steak Frites. As mentioned earlier food wasn't bad by any means, I've just had substantially better for far less a price tag. As far as descriptions go the chicken came with polenta, asparagus, onions, - as in nothing like what is described on their website. It's correct on the menu in the restaurant however so I did know what I was ordering at the time.   Dessert was home-made smores - which isn't even listed on the web dessert menu. Again, just kinda meh. For $8 not exactly a splitable dessert portion wise either.   I definitely left more satisfied from lunch and at a much smaller price tag and therefore will probably just stick to visiting for lunch every now and then or possibly order from the pub menu for dinner and not much else looks appetizing there. The Pittsburgh Rueben seems to be the only saving grace.....",

We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since it's conveniently located inside the hotel.  The breakfast buffet here is $15/person and does not quite worth its value.  It's basically $15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items (eggs, bacon).  Lunch/dinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches.  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown, expect the typical American grill.  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless you're looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurant.",

    "text": "Today the kitchen was closed so we waited to be seated until it opened back up. When we were seated the dinning room was very busy and the servers were amazing. Our drinks were good! The service was awesome for how busy they were! The food was great. The reason for the 3 star not 5 is the one manager (bald and glasses) sat and ate a free dinner (I'm assuming it was free I didn't see a check book come to the table) instead of helping with the busy dinning room and bar. Any establishment that lets their manager do that is not running things right and that guy should have been helping. I run a restaurant in Florida and if my manager did that he wouldn't be there long. Hope he isn't here long the only draw back! Everyone else keep up the good work!",

    "text": "We stopped at Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie on a Friday night before heading over to the Byham Theater for the annual DVE Morning Show Comedy festival.  We had already eaten elsewhere so this visit was simply for wetting our whistles before heading to the show.  We bellied up to the bar.  The bar area was moderately busy but not overwhelming.  From what I gather there is a dining room located across the way.  There was only one bartender and we patiently waited to be served.  The bartender was pouring some drinks for the patrons already seated.  I glanced over the drafts and picked an IPA to go with and waited, and waited some more.  In the meantime a party of about 6 rolled over to the corner of the bar where we were seated and were standing there.  We had probably been waiting about 10 minutes by now.  Finally the bartender comes towards us just to pass right by to the crowd standing at the corner!  Blood boiled; foot tapped hard, face red.  So you know I am not happy.  I am actually trying to tell this bartender that we had been waiting long before these folks walked over but he ignored me.  Thank God there was a server that just so happened to be behind the bar when this occurred.  I said, I guess kind of rudely, do you think you could get us a drink?!  He looked at the bartender and kind of shook his head saying he was a server and was trying to get the drinks for his tables but sure.  I said I was sorry but we had been waiting and was completely ignored.  He seemed sympathetic, almost like he was solemnly agreeing out of experience.    We finished the first round and thankfully the same server happened to be behind the bar again.  I asked for two more and our check.  I thanked him profusely and stated I believed they have the wrong person running the bar.  He saved this review from one star.  Great job, wish I knew his name.  Maybe some time I will try them again, but I would steer clear of the bar if that same bartender were working.",

That's why we ended up at the bar.  The ambiance:  The bar is by the lobby and the lobby is the best place to be during a hot day.  Here's a look:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/braddocks-american-brasserie-pittsburgh?select=jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg#jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brad...</a>  The drinks:  My sister loved their Cosmo cocktail but she said that it is not unusual since Pittsburgh has excellent bartenders.  My Chardonnay was not shabby either. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/braddocks-american-brasserie-pittsburgh?select=jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg#_Ty0CSROdhF_-_96dPjKbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brad...</a>  The food:   You could order appetizers from the bar.  I particularly loved the Belgian fries and its dip. We also had Roasted Tomato Soup with Lardons (French bacon), Braised Short Rib Pierogies ( Polish dumplings similar to the Italians' ravioli) with creamed leek sauce, and Goat Cheese & Red Pepper Bruschetta. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/braddocks-american-brasserie-pittsburgh?select=jdVKRjnFD1_4xF_x-9OnIg#Myp6idkB98z3gOVlSFCiGg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brad...</a>  For dessert, we shared the Warmed Brownie with Banana Marshmallow, Salted Caramel, Candied Walnuts, a la mode.",

I went for brunch on a Sunday, when I walked in there was not a host or server around to seat our party. Someone from the kitchen staff that was at the omelette station told us to just seat ourselves, so we did.  It was not busy at all, there was only one other table there. We waited 10min before even being greeted by a server.  I went with the intentions of having breakfast which changed quickly after looking at the brunch buffet. The food had been sitting for a long time and you could tell (it looked very dried out). I still decided to get breakfast since there was an omelette station and Belgium waffle station that were both freshly made. 2 others in our party ordered the crab cake and steamed mussels and we're please with both.  I personally would not go back here for brunch or suggest the place to anyone else.",

Braddock's Street Side Grill/Bar resides inside the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel - a Marriott property. There is an entrance from both the street and from inside the hotel.  It's a small bar, but it's a good place to hang out, drink, and grab a bite to eat, assuming you want to eat earlier. They don't serve food here past 10:00 pm or so - which is kind of lame. Because of the nature of the downtown area in which the hotel is located, there are not a lot of residents - so most of the restaurants seem to close early. It's a damn shame too - as this place is missing out on offering more service to both hotel patrons and others in the area.  I stayed at this hotel 3 years ago for 3 days. During that stay, a majorly scary bout of severe weather pounded a large area of the upper midwest, including the Pittsburgh area - with unprecedented thunderstorm activity, flooding, and Tornadoes. Many of the hotel guests gathered in the Bar to drink and watch the Weather Channel and local weather station reports coming in - there were myriad Tornado watches and warnings - some not very far from Pittsburgh.  I pounded a few beers and single malt scotches during that scary period, and ate in the bar every night.  This last stay this past week - we came in to order food - and were informed that since it was after 10:00 pm - no food was available. I'll say it again - LAME! EPIC FAIL!  I like this little bar - but it's hard for me to give it more than 3 stars due to the food hours...",

As others have mentioned, the restaurant is within the very fancy Renaissance Hotel, but fancy dress isn't required.  We had made reservations, but there was no need. The restaurant was quite empty around 1 pm on Father's Day, with only one or two other parties. We experienced the wonderful service other Yelpers described. Our waiter kept our water full, offered great suggestions, graciously answered questions (or went to the chef for an answer), and was very knowledgeable about the sources of the food,  We had a coupon for a free appetizer from the hotel, we we tried the kielbasa board. The presentation was beautiful. I loved trying the different types of kielbasa with all the different sauces. For my meal, I ordered The Pittsburgh Reuben (\"The Big Ugly\") with a salad (choice of salad or fries). The salad was fresh and satisfying, the sandwich (if you can even call it that) even more so. It's huge--two slices of bread piled with sauerkraut, Russian dressing, and shaved pastrami topped with kielbasa, a potato pierogi, and cheese. More of a knife-and-fork job than a sandwich. I ordered it because I wanted to try everything--it was a good choice. I wasn't able to finish half the plate, so I packed the rest up in a to-go box and it made a great dinner.  The components of the sandwich were great. My favorite part was the bread, which soaked up the juices from the toppings but was still still buttery and crisp on the outsides. However, the meatiness of the sandwich got a little overwhelming after a bit--I wish I'd saved my salad to accompany the sandwich.  The other members of the group greatly enjoyed their meals as well. Mussels and frites, the croque minargie... all were cleared and declared delicious. It was a great dining experience overall, and a nice way to celebrate.",

    "text": "From the second we got here we had a great experience. The hostess who greeted us was extremely friendly and our waiter (Luis) was just perfect - friendly, knowledgeable, and adorable. :) The two gentlemen who brought us our food and cleared our dishes were also a pleasure.  As is our custom at restaurants we've not been to before, we ordered a big sampling of menu items (we both worked out a lot to make room for all the calories we were planning on consuming. (; ) We split four appetizers: short rib pierogies (perfectly refined comfort food), house Mac and cini (cheesy and fried happiness,) NY strip tartare (delicate and clean), and the bacon wrapped shrimp and cheddar grits (deliciously indulgent). Out of the four, my husband was crazy about the shrimp and grits (which says a lot since we frequently make that at home, from scratch, for dinner). I think I preferred the tartare (pierogies were a close second!)  As an entree, I got the half portion gnocchi and lobster. I will totally be coming back for it. Usually lobster mixed in with pasta or gnocchi is a gimmick. Not this! The amount of lobster was substantial (and *real* lobster, not langoustine) and paired perfectly with the sauce and gnocchi.  My husband got the fish and chips (huge portion, very tasty. He said he'd get it again.) The meatball was okay. But, I say this as an Italian who makes meatballs from scratch and my husband is also Italian. So, we're picky. ;) By the way, most of our entrees got packed up to go home. Our stomachs aren't THAT big. :)  For drinks, I got the Pittsburgh Winery white blend which was not too sweet, not too dry. It was a perfect white for my palate. My husband got Straub IPL (on tap) which he really enjoyed.   For dessert, we made some modifications. :) I got their creme brulee of the day with a side of cinnamon ice cream. My husband got the brownie with a side of their spicy chocolate sauce.   I was leery about coming here because of the 3.5 Yelp rating. I'm glad I ignored that low rating because this place was fantastic. The food and service combined earned this place five stars. We will be in the city next week and are actually thinking about coming here again. Side note: the manager (Kristin) was awesome!",

Maybe this is a matter of them not having any space for a restroom in the restaurant, but it was annoying. Other than that, everything was perfect.",

Food arrived a half hour or so later - we had been there over an hour. No offers for refills, so you'll be fine to drive home. Maybe they don't like selling their booze....but if you're looking for food and drink, find another spot.",

Special shout to Mimi for the info and recommendations she provided.",

    "text": "Braddock's is a nice downtown venue that serves very good food - I would certainly recommend it as an excellent pre-theater dining option.  I selected Braddock's because of its location - Heinz Hall is on the next block.  The restaurant is also near the Byham Theater and the Benedum Center.  There is a convenient city parking garage directly across 6th Street, where event parking was a very reasonable $7.  The restaurant itself is directly inside the very pleasant Renaissance Pittsburgh, complete with an old-fashioned lobby.  While the restaurant uses the term \"Brasserie,\" there didn't seem to be all that much French or Belgian about the establishment.  Most dishes are generally very good American-style options, mostly on the order of a steakhouse.  They did offer a french onion soup and bouillabaisse, as well as steak frites.  The steak options were cooked well and the filet mignon was very tender.  They did use a fair amount of bearnaise sauce, however, which made the dish feel a little heavy and somewhat dated.  The mashed potatoes were good, although not particularly inspired, while the asparagus was maybe a little limp.   The portions here are very generous here.  I ordered a caesar salad as a starter, and there as no way to finish the massive plates of green.  The dressing was excellent, however, and clearly made in house, with fresh notes of lemon.  There was certainly no possibility of dessert.    The cocktails were very good, maybe the highlight. I had a well-made Martinez, while my table-mates enjoyed the whiskey smash.  The service was very, very good.  The server was friendly and responsive, and the food arrived quickly.  The manager even stopped by to ask whether we enjoyed our meal.  Before the salads and appetizers, the server came by with complimentary bread and butter.  The bread was a very good, if not superlative, baguette and the butter was served perfectly - at room temperature and generously salted.  Since this restaurant is in the lobby of the Renaissance, you should know that the bathrooms are on the second story.  There is an elevator in the lobby (as well as a lovely staircase) to provide access, but if you have limited mobility, you should note that the bathrooms are a bit far away from the dining area.  The bathrooms themselves were spacious and very clean - I suspect they are also used for function rooms on the second floor.  If you are downtown and near the theaters for dinner, Braddock's is a great option.  You will enjoy an excellent drink, good (if not all that adventurous) food, and a very nice, unpretentious atmosphere.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Went here on a Sunday evening while in Pittsburgh recently. I had done some searching on Yelp and Open Table as we wanted a reservation for our party of 5. Parking was also an important decision element and you can get free valet for up to 4 hours at the hotel. We weren't quite sure if the restaurant was inside the hotel or next door and when we arrived realized it was inside (there is a small bar with same name that is accessible from the street or the lobby too). We were promptly seated at a round table that was large yet intimate enough for our party. I wanted to try so many things that I opted to do a bit of a sampler approach versus having a full meal. I started with the onion soup gratinee, which has bourbon in it (an homage to the whiskey strength of the restaurant). It was a solid onion soup and a good sized portion. My mom and I split the spinach salad which comes with spinach, strawberries, spicy pecans, bleu cheese crumbles and a poppy seed vinaigrette. All of my favorite salad things in one salad and it was fresh and tasty! For my main, I had the braised short rib pierogies with creamed leeks. I had read about these on numerous \"top Pittsburgh pierogi\" lists, which was another reason I chose this restaurant. They were melt-in-your-mouth good. Fresh bread was brought to the table and we shared a bottle of wine (you'll need to ask for the bottle menu as they don't initially bring it out). We enjoyed ourselves - the ambiance was airy and historic. There were other diners, but it wasn't overly crowded and it wasn't overly noisy. Our server was attentive and helpful as others considered their menu choices. All in all, a solid place I'm a fan of and would recommend to others.",

We had a great convo with our waitress Michelle, and placed our orders. The escarole soup came and I told my husband he'd have to make a 5 hour drive to get it for me next time I'm sick. The pork and hangar steak dishes were amazing. The manager and chef stopped by and chit chatted.  We loved it so much we went for breakfast. Again, amazing. Our waiter Gabe was perfect! After a Steelers game and the constant rain, we went back to Braddocks, there were too many unexplored dishes on the menu. We had the pretzel with fondue,  scallops, and the veal chop. We enjoyed thoroughly! Already planning a trip back!",

We started out with lamb shepherd's pie and bruschetta on crackers for appetizers. They both were so good that I really had to restrain myself from eating more since i wanted to save room for lunch.  They serve regular beverages in mason jars along with traditional drinks and wine. They offer a lunch pairing of either soup and salad or soup and sandwich for $12.00. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs I opted for their French onion soup and spinach salad. She explained that my soup selection would be $1.50 up charge before I placed my order. She also explained these items would be half portions.  She also suggested I add one of the additional toppings. In my case I choose shrimp.The lady sitting next to me ordered a corned beef sandwich which the call \"the big ugly\" which comes with a side of fries.  When my meal arrived I was glad I ordered the combo. Their servings are huge!!! The French onion soup was to die for and the shrimp on my salad were full size and cooked just right.  The lady who ordered \"the big ugly\" got a portion so huge that you would need at least 2 or even 3 people to finish it. She absolutely loved it and as expected ended up taking most of it home.  The staff made sure our beverages were always full and cleared used plates upon asking first. For an elegant restaurant I was glad we were able to dress casual here.  They do offer Wi-Fi but for some reason if you wish to utilize it then you must give them your e-mail address. Restrooms are located on the 2nd floor where you can either use and elevator or walk their grand staircase which gives you a beautiful atrium view of the lobby area and entrance to the restaurant.  In the front entrance there is a bar called Braddock's Streetside. We didn't go there since we had so much to eat and drink here. I'm especially grateful when I am told upfront what my charges are as well as great food and professional service.  Located next to the Byhum Theater this restaurant makes a great place for either pre or after theater dining as well. Hats off for a wonderful luncheon!!!",

The big, brandied pork chop is flavorful, and the cheese-grits served with it are a nice touch.  Our server was great.  He was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable.  When I asked what he liked, he had good answers and made good suggestions.  He was attentive, kept our drinks full, and showed up at appropriate times to haul off spent dishes and plates.

In addition to the egg entrees there is an excellent selection of fresh and delicious fruit, crisp bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and some tasty and fresh pastries.  All this, with a coffee, comes to about $23.  I guess my only constructive criticism is that for that price I think a Bloody Mary or mimosa should be included.  Fantastic service as well!

The staff where positively fantastic. I had the filet mignon with potatoes and broccoli. We also ordered a pretzel platter for the table. The pretzels where delicious and I would defiantly recommend them as an appetizer. The filet was cooked absolutely perfect and tasted totally delicious. The waitress was fantastic kept checking back if we needed anything or needed more or anything and how everything was and if everything was ok. overall food and service would get more than 5 stars to bad I can only give them 5 stars. I would defiantly go back again and I highly recommend Braddock's Rebellion.",

    "text": "While visiting Pittsburgh we stayed at the Renaissance and Braddock's is both the bar and the restaurant here.   Our first night we hit the bar after touring the University of Pittsburgh and we simply needed a break before heading up to the room. The bartenders were coming over to the tables to take orders and Wifey ordered a Bee sting, I had the Anderson Valley bourbon stout and we got some Bavarian pretzels for a mid afternoon snack. Pretzels and cheese dip were awesome and the drinks were on point. We stopped down here one other time while we were here and the bartender REALLY knew her bourbons...found me at least one new one to buy for myself.   We ate breakfast here in the restaurant twice and while both breakfasts were quite delicious they were also quite expensive. Yes, I get it...it's a hotel restaurant, but I don't have to LIKE the high prices. Wifey had the cracked yolk sandwich both times and loved it. I had two eggs, bacon, awesome hash browns and really good bread with homemade strawberry jam. My second meal I had a ham and spinach omelet with hash browns and it was excellent-fluffy and tasty and the has browns were again cooked perfectly.   Loved the bar, loved the service at the bar and restaurant, liked the food a lot, but the prices were simply too much.",

    "text": "On my last day in town, I splurged on their $27 breakfast buffet. When set up, it takes up a good chunk of the sitting area in the lobby of the Renaissance Marriott.   The offerings are diverse: French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, omelet station, waffles, roast beef, ham, etc. You can easily get your money's worth here, but if you're not going to partake in the carving stations, it might not be worth it. Then again, $14 for a plate of French toast on the main menu isn't really worth it either. So, maybe you're better off with the buffet.   I caught the buffet at the wrong time. The French toast was hard. The bacon was just about depleted, and it wasn't restocked while I was there. The sausage was meh. Breakfast potatoes so-so. The big plate of fruit that I got on my second trip through the buffet was more satisfying.   The service was great. My server was cordial and social.  Overall, I probably would not repeat this experience. The food doesn't measure up to the price charged. This was the only part about staying at the Renaissance that I didn't enjoy.",

The first time was my pre-Yelp days, but I actually took a pic of the sandwich, because it was such a yummy monstrosity. It might have been a monte Cristo?   This time, we ordered the pork belly and Mac n cini. Both were fantastic. The pork belly came with grits and chicharrones. The whole dish just worked well together. The other dish was essentially deep fried risotto balls (with just a hint of spice). Also excellent. I got the double chocolate mousse to go, and I was very happy in our hotel room when I dove into it about an hour later.   A few other comments. Matt was our bartender/waiter. Very big props to Matt. I'm always a fan of people who are personable and knowledgeable. Matt is. I also like the newspaper style menu. Lastly, if you like bourbon or whiskey in general, they have a great selection.",

    "text": "My husband and I made a reservation for an early dinner before a weekend show. Our primary impression of Braddock's Rebellion was the noise level (very loud). We spent $70 (plus tip) for two entrees and one cocktail. The food was just okay, although the table service was very fast (30 minutes from sitting to plates). Hubby tried the ravioli of the day, which was fine, but he tired of the same taste combination on one plate. I ate the scallops, which were paired with vinegar greens and a saffron risotto. The eponymous cocktail was good, not earth-shattering, although smelling the piney scent of fresh rosemary with every sip was a small, pleasant revelation. Between the retro, mid-century decor and the hipster, alcohol-themed menu, it seemed like the kind of restaurant to which young people bring their parents or grandparents so the older generation can pay the bill. Be ye forewarned: the restrooms are upstairs on the second floor; I took the grand staircase but presumably there is an elevator for those with challenged mobility.  Pro-Tip: Apparently the downtown garages start charging their event rate at 6pm, so if you can park before then, you can enjoy a leisurely dinner without paying through the nose for it.",

It's literally freezing cold in there on a cold evening, the lighting is ugly, and the place feels very sterile, which is odd because the restaurant looks very warm and inviting.  The bartender only had six people at the bar, yet it took her 15 minutes to get to us, in hindsight I think she must have been the service bar for the restaurant also but there did not appear to be any patrons in the restaurant so it's really unclear what took her so long. She did apologize for the wait but if one person can't handle the bar, they need to staff it better.  The cocktails, once received, were good. But given the chilly atmosphere and long wait, I think we will find another spot for our post-theater cocktail.",

There were booths and table tops.  I was lucky enough just to catch the end of breakfast which was what I was in the mood for so it worked out. I had the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. It came out in a skillet which was good with potatoes and toast. Toast came with some homemade jam which was delicious and the server made sure to let me know it was homemade.

We let our server know that we were on a short timeline and she really kept things moving, we were very thankful. The starting bread (mix of white and cheese) was served with a surprisingly buttery olive oil and the busboy was very attentive to replenishing it.  Our server recommended dishes with quicker prep times and so we landed on shrimp linguine with brocolini and mushroom ravioli, both of which were very good, though the linguine dish was on the small side. 2 drinks and 2 entrees with tip came out to $81. The service and food was great so we will certainly be back again and hopefully have more time to spend!",

I got the (tomato) soup and half (chicken) sandwich combo. The tomato soup tasted nearly identical to Panera's tomato soup, but with some bacon and a basil oil of some sort. While I enjoyed the soup, I couldn't justify the price when I could pay half for basically the same thing at Panera. The sandwich was okay. The sandwich toppings were good but the chicken was a bit dry.   My lunch experience here was about average. I would consider coming back, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "My below-average rating is due to my most recent visit. I've been here a handful of times as the location is quite convenient to the theatre venues in town. Food is decent, but good food isn't hard to come by so it's really the service that makes the experience in my opinion. Our party of 7 has a reservation at noon before a 2p show last week. We were all on time and seated promptly and there were NOT many people there until probably 15-30 min after our arrival. Our waiter Gabe was never overly friendly and our drinks were empty (both waters and paid beverages) more than full. Many of us had to ask for refills. I ordered a burger done medium and when it was brought out, it was burned. Not well done -burned.  When I told the waiter, he looked at me disgusted and *literally* didn't say a word, just walked away with my plate. Who I assume was the manager came over probably 10 min later and gave a half apology, blamed being busy and having a new chef. She did comp my wine but I never expected that. Lunch took so long that we walked into our show at the Byham (...next door) just 10 min before the show started. Very underwhelmed at this point and uncertain on returning. I am however attaching a picture of my scallops from a previous dinner there that were delicious.",

A solid menu, not the most interesting but always good.   I love that they will serve both menus in the restaurant or Streetside. I prefer Streetside just because I like the ambiance of a bar setting, but both are nice.  Also, the sound level is great. They don't blast music and the acoustics allow you to hear the people you're dining with.   My only complaint is that they over-cook their burgers, but that is more than compensated by the fact that their other food options are quite good. I highly recommend the short rib pierogies.",

    "text": "My mom was in town for a conference, and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to use my Groupon to Braddock's.  A short walk from her hotel on a beautiful day, we strolled in to the lobby of the Renaissance hotel to find the restaurant.  What a GORGEOUS hotel!  It makes me want to wear a long red dress and walk slowly down a staircase to greet a crowd of admirers.  Classy place.  The restaurant has a classy vibe too - leather booths, white tablecloths, and dim lights.  We started with cocktails - alas, the cocktail menu is not on the website (or I'm dumb and can't find it) - but whatever we had, it was delicious.  I believe it was marked as the house specialty cocktail.  I wasn't sure I'd like it because sometimes I'm a little iffy on whiskey, but it was actually fruity and delicious.  We both loved it.  Next, we split the goat cheese and beet salad (which they put on separate plates for us), and it was great.  Sweet beets, amazing fried goat cheese, tasty vinaigrette.  Oh - and we also got a soft, warm baguette wrapped in paper, with a plate of sweet butter.  For my entree, I had mussels and frites \"Billi-bi\" style, which means in a saffron-cream broth.  The frites were served with an aioli.  I also had a side of garlic spinach.  The entree didn't bowl me over - mussels were well prepared and the broth was tasty, but it wasn't long before it seemed too rich for me, and became a little hard to eat.  There was just so much broth and it was so creamy!  The spinach did a nice job of cutting through the heavy meal, but the overall effect was still a bit much.   Way too full for dessert!  I think our meal came to about $90 (Mom got the daily special, a fish dish) - so that's $90 for two drinks, one salad, a side dish, and two entrees.  It's pricey.  The Groupon helped. I think I would return though, it made a good impression.  Our server felt a bit rushed - she didn't really connect with us and always seemed to be moving quickly, but that's okay.  There weren't many people in the restaurant at all, which was kind of sad on a Friday.  More people should give this place a shot!",

My beet salad was fresh and tasty, but I had to mix the ingredients myself: the beets and nuts were hiding underneath the lettuce, and the goat cheese and crab cake were sitting on the edges.  Also, the wait staff was perhaps a bit over-enthusiastic, even going so far as to suggest that my French onion soup was browned perfectly on top as it was being served.   That being said, everything tasted good: the steak, the fish and chips, and especially the desserts!",

Why mussels in white wine of course w/ frites! Excellent. As a former resident of the Pacific Northwest I know a little something about shellfish. The mussels at Braddock's are by far the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Each time I ordered them a large steaming bowl was brought to the table. Each time every single mussel was delicious, plump and perfectly prepared. Not a single bad mussel...not one! The frites are crisp as one would expect with a Belgian preparation. They come with a garlic mayo dip. My friend had a Reuben made with portabello mushrooms rather than meat and it was excellent (I tried some:) My daughter had mac and cheese that was not your boxed version. The beer list is excellent with a great representation of local beers, nationals and import. I have yet to see the wine list, but expect that it has nice offerings. This has become my go to place when downtown for a chill beer and excellent shellfish.",

As you think about going here, you really don't want to eat in a hotel (Renaissance) restaurant and feel like it can't possibly be good but give it a try. It is extremely convenient for hitting before a show next door at the Byham or across the street at the Heinz.  We intended to try the Streetside bar/ restaurant but it was packed out so went to the full restaurant. Gotta say, we really like the ambience in the lobby and restaurant - soft lighting, good colors, inviting sofas/ chairs, and never much noise at all.  We were promptly seated, and the server was friendly and never intrusive.  The food is moderately expensive (a hotel after all) but is VERY well presented, excellent portions, and was all very tasty.   They have lots of coupons/ deals out there, so if you can find one of those and stop by before a show, this is a nice, unexpected place.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that as a recent graduate who's moving halfway around the world in a couple of months, if not for Groupon, I wouldn't have ended up here.  It's costly.  That said, I'm glad I got the chance to try it out.  Braddock's American Brasserie is sort of half-attached to a hotel downtown.  It's not a big place, mostly just a bar and a series of tables.  The noise level is about right: You can have a conversation without feeling like everyone's going to hear you, but there's no trouble hearing the people at your table.  The ambiance is slightly classy, but in jeans and a t-shirt I still didn't feel like I was under-dressed.    We went for the burgers, and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the Pittsburgher, which is topped with barbecue sauce (if I recall correctly,) a short-rib pierogie, and caramelized onions.  It was delicious and monstrously heavy, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Sure, it was a bit messy, but totally worth it.  Word of advice: Unless you're counting calories, get the fries, not the salad.  The salad my buddy got was tiny, but they REALLY pile on the fries.  For a place that makes a big deal of their whiskey selection, I'd have to say my Manhattan was mixed well, and they certainly didn't skimp on the liquor.  That's good, because it was $9, so if anything had been wrong with it, it would have cost WAY too much.  My friend got a plate full of scallops, and they were perfectly done.  I generally don't like shellfish, so if I ate them and liked them, I'd recommend them as an appetizer to anyone.  In the complaint department, I would say our waitress had to come back and ask us to remind her what we had ordered a couple of times, which wasn't really a problem, just sort of unusual.  Also, my friend's burger was only okay, according to him.  They promised him hot sauce, and they didn't really put much on it.  If you're downtown, and looking for a decent burger, try this place.",

My husband and I came here because we had a groupon, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much from a hotel restaurant.  Boy, was I wrong.  The lobby of the hotel is really cool-- urban and chic-- and the restaurant decor continues in this vein.  The charcuterie plate was the stand out of the evening.  The \"small\" portion is loaded with cured meats, pates, little pickles and the fabulous bacon caramel.  The caramel was deep brown and sweet, loaded with chunks of thick-cut bacon.  We so enjoyed this first visit that we returned for my hubby's birthday.  All told, we've had the cheese platter (diverse, tasty cheeses), the lobster cassoulet (chock full o' lobster and delicious), seared scallops (cooked perfectly), veal milanese, and the steak frites (delicious fries).  If I love Braddock's so much why don't I marry it and give it 5 stars?  Well, the waitresses could be a little more put together.  Their uniform is a bulky black shirt with black pants, and a tailored look would go better with the atmosphere.  Also, their beers and cocktails, while delicious, can be a bit expensive.  Minor gripes, but they're keeping me at a 4.5 star review.",

They have what's probably the best whisk(e)y menu in Pittsburgh, with tasting flights available by style, label, and country, and they also serve our local Wigle.  The bartenders are incredibly friendly and prompt with service despite the length of the bar.  There's a nice lounge on the ground floor of the hotel where you can wait for a seat at the bar, and they serve drinks in there as well.  Much more casual than the Brasserie; you can get away with jeans here.  If you like whiskey, check out Street Side.  If you're looking for food, stick with the Brasserie or another restaurant in the area.

The food ended up being really good, although the preparation was pretty slow (and as I mentioned, we were in a bit of a hurry).  I really enjoyed the lobster and gnocchi dish - really unique and delicious.  Great blend of flavors (who thought that peas would go with gnocchi?).  The salad was ok - I had the goat cheese and beet since I'm a sucker for goat cheese.  The reason that I must rate them highly though is because my dad was happy.  My dad, the world's pickiest eater.  The man who will not eat anything with \"cream\" or \"cheese\" or \"onion\" or \"garlic\" or anything, ANYTHING that he deems as different (which automatically becomes \"weird\" with an \"Ewww, who would want that?!\").  He ate the Amish chicken (I think the name helped, because he does have a weird thing for the Amish).  Of course he plained-it-up, opting for no polenta or relish, never touching the asparagus, and getting a side of fries.  He was pleased!  He LIKED it and really liked the fries.  Success!",

    "text": "I just recently got to experience Braddock's on a whim with a friend on a Friday evening. I was surprised they weren't busier at 6pm on a Friday, but it's possible that they get busier later, as 6pm can actually be considered early on a weekend.   We ordered a glass of wine (a surprisingly affordable glass of Cabernet) and the cheese plate appetizer. It was amazing! The service was OK, although the server seemed like she was running the whole place (or something was keeping her busy and spacey) and the expediter seemed a bit distant, too. This was a little bit of a surprise for a place like this, but we were in a good mood and it genuinely didn't bother us.  I chose to order from the bar menu because after walking through and seeing someone with a burger, my mind immediately had made up its' mind. I got the Braddock's Burger and it was amazing! The beef bacon was almost too much, but I appreciated the uniqueness. The meat was cooked perfectly and was juicy and flavored well, without being too over-powerful and you could still taste burger. The bun never got soggy and help up. The fries were also good, but a little too salty.  My only real complaint is the location of the bathrooms. They are hotel / public bathrooms that are up a very large set of stairs. I'm fine with it, but I was surprised that they weren't more convenient.   Overall, I'll be back!",

Good, surprisingly inexpensive drinks, including a nice selection of microbrews on tap. A nice atmosphere, including some comfortable couches and a great classic tile floor. Drunken conference travelers. Men loudly explaining things to their younger colleagues. Sloshed local theater goers staying at the hotel for the night. As such, I'm giving Braddock's the highest possible rating I'd give, for a hotel bar.",

    "text": "This could have been 4 stars but the food was a little bit lacking.  First the good.  Very friendly staff behind the bar, with a great selection of hootch.  I had a Braddock Smash which was nice but not something I'd sit around drinking too much.  Now, the Whiskey Sours were well poured and very good.  And the wife's Vodka Tonics were very good, according to her.  And the homemade tater chips were excellent, and very addictive (and us on diets!! Geez).  However, the food could have been better.  We ordered off the Brassierre's menu, scallops for me, filet for her.  The scallops were ok but I've had better.  The polenta was a bit cool so not much to say about that.  The wife's filet looked good, had good texture, and was cooked right.  But it didn't appear to be seasoned.  Plus, the bearnaise was awfully thick, or at least thicker than what we're used to.  Overall, a good place to drink.  And although the food we ordered was off the mark a bit, I definitely wouldn't mind going back and trying a burger off of their menu (if it wasn't downtown, that is!!).  Update -  went back for drinks and dinner with wife and her brother.  This time I had something called the Pittsburgh Ugly sandwich, basically a Reuben with a sliced sausage link on it, topped off by a potato perogie.  What are these perogies y'all eat here?  This one was like trying to eat the cotton ball from a bottle of aspirin.  Yuck!!!  And the sandwich was so dry I could hardly chew it. Did they forget the Russian Dressing?  I'm taking no stars away from my original review but only because I like the bar.  Will not eat anything else here but the homemade tater chips.",

I like that they buy local, and their specials usually reflect that.  Their portions are huuuge, and the price is reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get.  Their desserts are also spectacular, but I must say I am disappointed they changed their apple tart (The first time we got it, it came with ice cream and baked basil on top - yum yum yum).  I would definitely and have recommended this restaurant to friends and family.",

    "text": "I will start out by saying that my friend is a chef there, so I am a bit biased, but the food really does stand on its own.   J and I arrived at 7 pm on a Friday and it really wasn't as busy as I was expecting it to be.  We were sat in a very comfortable booth in the back where I ordered the blackberry capirinha (or some such spelling).  It's Brazilian, normally doesn't have blackberries in it, but is much better for it.  Even if you don't want food, this is the place to go for drinks.  The bartenders definitely know how to pour.  (We have been to the bar in the past for some of the best bourbon drinks I have ever had.)  The waitress brought us some fresh-made, warm bread with butter and sea salt.  I am not sure the salt is necessary.  Some salt and herbs would be nice though.  But the bread was very good.  We also got the braised short rib pierogies that are served on a bed of creamed leeks that tasted a lot like saurkraut, but milder.  They were perfectly cooked and really tasty.  For the main course, I had the mussels and frites in the Strip District sauce which was a tomato-garlic sauce with kielbasa and herbs.  I get mussels a lot and while the mussels weren't the best I have ever had, the sauce certainly was.  So much flavor packed into this tomato broth.  There was really not enough bread for me to sop it all up. The frites were also awesome - crunchy and covered in sea salt and herbs.  I think the salt was a bit heavy-handed, but it complimented the mussels very well.  J had the pasta special - fresh-made pasta in a tomato broth with scallops, shrimp, zucchini and a hint of lemon.  The scallops were smaller than we were expecting, but the flavor more than made up for it.  The shrimp were huge and the whole dish was very filling, and yet still light and summery.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough room for dessert (I think I ate a whole loaf of the bread myself), but we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Valentines weekend with my Honey! It was a Saturday night after the big love holiday. I had a Living Social deal for dinner. Made a reservation at 8pm 2 weeks in advance and I was set. Parking in the garage on a Saturday night on 6th street pre event, symphony, theater, what have you.... slightly painful but not really an issue. The restaurant is inside a hotel. Did not know that. The decor is modern romantic, deep booths, dark browns, and violets. The booths take you back to an older era. Mob boss round booths have an intimate appeal. I had asked from my open table reservation to be placed out of the way but we were sat in the middle of the restaurant in an angled booth. It felt like I was on a center stage.   The menu was interesting but one item caught my eye. Lobster Cassoulet! They were sold out. Pouting I asked the waitress to reccomend something for me. Lobster Gnocchi?? Hmmm. Gnocchi can be kind of heavy and pasty but I went with it.  So incredibly delicious. Tiny puffs in a creamy mushroom and artichoke base sauce. Lots a lobster and perfect sweet claw meat right on top of the dish. If I would go back for just one item it would be The lobster gnocchi. \" Lobster Killer\" They have two sizes half and full portion. I was begrudgingly sharing with my BF so we got the full but I don't think the half would have been adequate.  To start we had the meat plate. The sauces were tasty that accompanied the various meats in the Charcuterie plate. The half size is plenty for two. The BF had mussels that were good and standard. If we did not have a deal the bill would have been on the expensive side and we didn't order anything alcoholic either.",

I stopped in here after a show for a quick glass of wine with a friend.  The selection was decent but a bit on the pricey side 10-14 a glass.

The drink selection was varied but we both chose cocktails. My fiancee's \"Braddock Smash\" and my \"Moscow Mule\" were both well made, though my drink was not served in the correct vessel.   We chose the charcuterie board (half) for our opener, the selection of meats included no spectacular choices. I was reminded of a cold cut platter from the supermarket.  Provided with the meal was a rather nondescript bread, with a well warmed butter sprinkled with sea salt.   The meal took a pleasant turn as our entree arrived. A beautifully cooked (medium rare as requested) 18 ounce cowboy steak (ribeye). The steak was served on cooked yet still crisp asparagus spears and a bed of smooth mashed potatoes with what I can only guess was a veal demi glace. Truely the high point of the meal.  Coming off of the well executed main course we moved on the dessert. At the servers recommendation we chose the croissant bread pudding. The dish arrived and looked amazing. This look was only skin deep. The interior was quite dry - a matter we remedied with additional creme anglaise and caramel sauce procured for us by our waitress.  I enjoyed the meal well enough overall, though I doubt I would return.",
