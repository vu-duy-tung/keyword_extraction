    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast memories as a little kid was going to IHOP and being able to pick out anything I wanted for breakfast.  On Saturday we decided to try the recently opened McCandless IHOP.  We arrived around 8 am.  The lobby was very crowded and the hostess informed us that the kitchen was about 15 minutes behind.  We didn't care, I wanted some breakfast!!  We were seated fairly quickly and greeted right away by our awesome server Darryl.  He checked on us frequently, making sure that we were happy.    BJ got a French Toast combo with scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns.  The kitchen sent out bacon, Darryl went back to the kitchen and immediately returned with his links.  For my breakfast, I got the Smokehouse Combo with two smoked sausage links served with two eggs, hash browns and two buttermilk pancakes.  The smoked sausages where huge and yummy.  And the hash browns here were perfectly cooked.  They have the exact amount of crunchy crisp on the outside and the inside is tender and tasty.  They were out of this world hash browns.  I am serious.  And the pancakes.  Oh, my.  I love them here.  So fluffy and I love the buttermilk flavor.  Oh, my.  Love IHOP!",

Unless you absolutely must have something only IHOP can provide, there are ten other breakfast places in the surrounding area that are much better in terms of quality, cost, and service. Our family of four ordered pancakes and eggs that took 40 minutes to arrive. We thought we had been forgotten. Once there, the hash browns and eggs were cold, the pancakes fresh. Clearly they have a major timing problem in the kitchen. It was also a humid evening and there were box fans blowing in various parts of the room. Why would a brand new building like theirs not have properly functioning air conditioning?  Strange visit all around.",

You have to wait a long time to be seated because there is no hostess or cashier. The waiters and waitresses are doing it all. Once we finally sat down, we received our drinks promptly and then no one would take our order. After 20 minutes we found the waitress and asked for our drink check and we were leaving. She seemed surprised. Will avoid this IHOP in the future. :P",

I ordered a bacon cheese burger and onion rings. My friend ordered a \"Rise and Shine breakfast\"  that includes eggs, toast, hash browns and meat that she substituted with  sliced tomatoes because she didn't want meat. Both our orders took at least 20 min. and both were cold when it reached our table. The bacon was half raw, the hamburger was cold and greasy as were the hash browns. The toast was only dry bread. I complained  and the waitress took the stuff back and the manager came out to talk to us. Every thing was remade and was served warm. The manager apologized, comped our meals and gave me a gift card. This I consider to be excellent service to keep us as customers although I'm not sure I will try anything other than pancakes as I sit here hours later in gastric distress re-tasting that greasy burger.",

There were tons of waitresses & it wasn't horribly busy.  I can't understand why he wasn't shadowed.  Instead, they threw him out there when he wasn't ready & let the customer deal with it.  I had so much anxiety watching him struggle.  He forgot several different things, we had to wait a long time for the check, then the check was wrong.  I don't blame him, I blame the management.  A manager wasn't to be found until I asked for her.  I can understand having a new person & I am understanding when their are errors, but this was a fiasco.  This IHOP is riddled with service issues.  I have seen in the past where the front counter person has to be a waitress  also.  The only reason that they get 2 stars is because the food was good.",

    "text": "Stopped here after having an MRI done to get some food as my sugar was getting low.  We were seated fairly quickly which should have been as it was fairly empty.  Once seated we ordered an appetizer sampler platter and the childs food as he was very hungry and usually order like this so that he can eat and not be freaking out due to hunger.  It took at least 20 minutes for the appetizer to arrive and at least 10 minutes more for his cheeseburger.   He was happy playing and loved the fruit.  Wifey got the new sweet crepes combo and loved them.  Daughter got double crepes turkey bacon and eggs.  She has no idea that you say without specific amounts they always give you the larger most expensive size.  Of course her meal was the most expensive.   Oh well at lleast this time she ate most of it.  I ordered a simple double cheeseburger no onion or lettuce and add mayo and pickle.  The toasted bun was burnt all around tge edges making the taste totally unacceptable.   After pulling apart the bun and ripping it to shreds I was able to eat a portion of it ending up with about 2/3 of 1 bun as my top and bottom.   I had ordered the potato bacon soup also and it arrived after reminding the server she was apologetic and brought me a bowl that was scorching hot.  You can tell it was microwaved and the look was very very yellow.  Not one cent was taken off of our check of 53.38.  I have eaten in many ihops all over this country and can say this was the worst I have ever experienced.",

Firstly, my menu was sticky with eitrher syrup or soda they just didn't bother wiping down enough, which j was just goiing to ignore because they were busy when we got there. But it just went downhill from there. It took forever for our server to be told that the fold wasn't ready and then we found out that part of the reason it was taking so long was because they didn't have the food I ordered. Then when my food came, I had no silverware ( the \"hostess\" hadnt given us any when she basically dumped us in out booth- I'm being generous using the term hostess for a little girl with a sour attitude and an \"I don't give a fuck\" look when we said hello to her). They also only brought my husband his fries and no burger and when the \"burger\" Finally came it was obviously a boiled burger i  could have made more appetizing over a campfire in the middle of the woods. The only rededming part of the whole trip was our server Allen. He did everything in his power to make it as pleasant an experience as he could and it was obvious he was just caught in a shit storm behind t he scene. He was awesome. But I would just tell him to get a better job somewhere else where he would be appreciated.",

I'll start by saying that I don't hate IHOP, but it would be a stretch for me to say that I even like IHOP. Last night, however, was a disaster and left me not wanting to return for a long time.  First things first, they were clearly understaffed and although there were numerous empty tables there was a wait. Not the fault of the server team, but at the end of the day they are the ones that have to deal with customers.   Also, have you ever been to a restaurant where the server instructed you on what to do with you plates when finished eating? Specifically, she asked that we move them to the end of the table and stack them. Odd, eh?   The food, not terrible, not great. Speaking of food, the boyfriend ordered one thing and got another. He's too kind of a guy to not say anything to the server, but boy did I want to mention the fact that he didn't order what was presented to him.   Check arrived and we were happy to see that we weren't charged for OJ (maybe the server realized she screwed up the order?)   It's remarkable that we didn't see anyone walk out the door without paying. However, we did see numerous customers waiting by the cash register to pay and leave, but there wasn't anyone to take their money. Lucky for us, when it came time to leave I was able to get the attention of a server that quickly helped us close out our bill.  Service 2 Food 2 Location 3",

The server came to take our drink order 10 mins later. I asked her a question about what a menu item included (kids' silly named pancake)since it wasn't spelled out on the menu. She told us \"I think strawberries\" and walked away. She came back to take our order 15 mins later. I ordered the said pancakes and asked her to check on the strawberries and if they were not included to add some if possible or let us know so my daughter could order something else. Still didn't receive our drinks. After another 10 mins went by I flagged down a random worker and asked to see our server for our drinks. She brought them over then. Another 15 mins went by and our food came out. There were no strawberries, of course. We were really hungry and decided to just let it go. I asked for drink refills, utensils and ketchup. After 10 mins we didn't receive any of those w/our full plates of food sitting in front of us and no utensils to eat with. I got up and helped myself to utensils, ketchup and napkins and another table near us followed me. She never came back with any of those things. A few mins later she went by and said \"you okay?\" as she kept on walking by. Our food was just eh. Maybe it would have been better warm. I asked for well done bacon and it was slimy and rubbery. I was supposed to get 3 pieces of french toast but got 2. I added cheese on my eggs and there wasn't any. We waited so long to see her gain to get our bill that I seriously considered just leaving. When I finally flagged her down and asked for our bill I just got a receipt kind of thing with the total- not an itemized bill. I paid it and just left. It was such a long, terrible, experience that we just wanted to get out of there and I didn't ask to speak to a manager about any of this. I don't expect much from this kind of place but this is so bad that I won't give them anymore of my money.",

    "text": "This was my second time eating at IHOP, first time at this location and it's great that they are open 24 hours - that sign is what caught our eye as we were leaving the Cinemark movie theater across the highway.  They have the standard fare for this style of restaurant but what I like about IHOP is their expanded breakfast selections.  There is a lot to choose from from the usual eggs, bacon/sausage, hash browns, and toast to a variety of omelets, their famous selection of pancakes, and both sweet and savory crepe options - most of which can be combined into some kind of combo meal at a reasonable price.  They also offer a selection of burgers and sandwiches, a handful of entrees, and some appetizer fare so overall it's a well-rounded menu.  I ordered the California Scramble with hash browns and 2 blueberry pancakes.  The eggs come scrambled with melted jack cheese topped with sliced avocado and salsa - you have the option of smashed red potatoes and onions or hash browns and also the choice of tortilla, toast or two buttermilk pancakes for under $10 which is a great deal.  My boyfriend got the breakfast sampler which is two eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 pork sausage links, 2 pieces of ham, hash browns, toast, and 2 pancakes also for around $10.  Another nice feature is that you can \"upgrade\" your pancakes from regular buttermilk to any other flavor of pancake for a small upcharge, which we both did and our meal still came to under $25 with tax, so not a bad deal for dinner out.  The service was a mix but mostly because it seemed that there were only 2 people working the floor while we were there, but we went after seeing a movie so we got there around 9:30 PM on a Thursday, which I'm sure isn't typically a busy time, hence only 2 people on shift in the dining room.  Our server was really nice, but she was covering a lot of tables and our table didn't have regular syrup, which we had to ask for and the toast didn't come with my boyfriend's order, so we had to ask for that as well.  I don't fault her, I just think that they were understaffed.  The floors needed to be swept/vacuumed but again, while they weren't overwhelmingly busy there were only 2 people working.  Overall it was a decent experience, and I might go back the next time I'm in the area and craving breakfast late night.",

Once we walked in we were greeted, immediately seated and handed our menus then nothing for over 20 minutes! No waiter/ waitress, nothing!  A very nice waiter walked by and saw the disgust on our faces and asked had we be waited on and we told him no and that we been seating there for over 20 minutes. He repeatedly apologized and asked us what we wanted to drink. Not even a minute later he was back with our drinks and took our orders. He then told us that he had let the manager know what happend and that our entire meal was free.   My wife and I had the red velvet pancake combo that comes with three sausage links, three pieces of bacon, hash browns and eggs and our daughter had a kids chocolate chip pancake and sausage. All of our food was excellent but, the highlight of the meal was the red velvet pancakes! Run don't walk to IHOP to try them!  While we were eating the manager came over and apologized for the mishap and told us our meals would be free and that he hopes we will come back and give them another try.   The fact that our waiter's shift was over but, he stayed to wait on us after no one else did still has me blown away! Now that is customer service done right! Our waiter was great and the food was even better. We will defiantly be back!",

After waiting for 10 min to put in an order, 10 min for coffee, then the cold food.  They gave us 25% off and a card for $10 off on our next visit, really?  I told them that this should be comped after embarrassing us so much and told them to keep the damn card.  Then went upfront to pay and somebody in the back said \"F them they aren't going to pay, call the cops\". I don't walk out on checks this was another embarrassment.  I had the GM called the front, and she comped the check.  I will call corporate and I expect the food runner to be fired and the GM Demoted.  This is NOT how you run a restaurant!  I have NEVER been so embarrassed in all my life of eating out.  Never eating at another IHOP again.  I don't know why we didn't go to Eat n Park.  BTW, this is in an affluent area of Pittsburgh, not an area where people will walk checks, this is not the hood.",

The server brought us a huge bowl of soup instead of a little cup and we had to send it back because it was cold. Our food took way longer than expected since it wasn't busy at all. I ordered egg whites with cheese, turkey sausage, plain brioche French toast, and grilled red potato hash. Instead I got regular eggs with a ridiculous amount of cheese, turkey bacon, hash browns, and my French toast had stuff all over it (no clue what was on it). I told my server and he insisted those were egg whites and that I had said turkey bacon because they don't have turkey sausage. He got me the red potatoes which weren't grilled like he had said, they were definitely fried so I didn't eat them. The onions and peppers put on top weren't even grilled. All in all I had a pretty horrible time here and probably won't come back to this location.",

The place is brightly lit inside and harsh for dining pleasure.  Expect loud unruly families here. Just be sure not to sit in a table after they leave because families are filthy Slobs, with crumbs and greasy food everywhere, on chairs, booths . Babies often sitting on tables , diapered and barefoot.  Being a cheap joint in a suburban setting lures families who are cheap and want their kids to eat quasi junk food",

Oh, their home fries are terrific! It's shredded potatoes, but chunks.  I always get it extra well done so there's a crisp to it that I can't resist!  I do like their pancakes, but only in moderation (because of this illogical aversion to breakfast foods).   The banana fosters was pretty tasty, but super sugary.  I would recommend getting the sauce on the side so you can have it as sweet as you'd like without drenching the toasts.  I would recommend this place, but I don't think I'd label myself as  \"Yay!

We got seated - took a long time, 15 minutes,  for a wait person to come over finally did - seemed like we were bothering them by being there.  Food was served in parts - mine came first - then husbands 5 mins later - took too long considering we were one of 2 people at tables -  food served - no silverware - husband went and asked another server for silverware - she said \"your waitress will bring it\" - he insisted because food was getting cold - she finally gave it to him. Staff not enthusiastic about their job - some thing happened at our first visit.  Food tasted good but presentation was horrible things just piled on the omelet haphazard - sadly we will never return - don't understand how this place stays open.  Never offered refills on my iced tea - only saw the server again when it came time to pay.  never thanked for coming in.  I should not have tipped anyone.  The family behind us also had issues with their meal as well.  I gave them a second chance - nothing has improved - STAY AWAY - go to Denny's",

    "text": "I wish there is an option to select zero stars!  The scene at the hostess station when  we arrived should have been a red flag.   A few employees were staring at the seating chart and ignored us for a few minutes despite seeing us enter the restaurant.  One of them finally asked \"how many of you\" in a voice that seem to suggest that we were inconveniencing her by being there.   After receiving the answer,  she peered into the dining area and said nothing else.  The hostess (a different employee) then asked again for the number of people in our party,  despite standing in front of the first employee all this time and hearing our response.     It took 10 minutes after being seated for a waitress to acknowledge us and ask 'did she get to you yet?'.  I presume the waitress assigned to our table was MIA.  It then took another 10 minutes to get the water we asked for.   There was plenty of opportunity to look around the restaurant while waiting - many tables were not served (no drinks) despite them having arrived before us,  a few seem to have been waiting a while for someone to take their food order, write a few were waiting for their food,  and a table across from us had food that was incorrectly prepared.  A woman,  whom I presume to be the manager from her attire, made a few appearances in the dining area,  seemingly unperturbed by the frustrated looks on the guests' faces.   When our pancakes finally arrived, we discovered that 2 our of our 3 orders had undercooked pancakes with raw batter in the middle.  Mind you,  this is IHOP, a restaurant that is supposed to specialize in pancakes!  Instead of sending it back,  we decided to eat the portions that were edible as there was no telling how long it would take to flag down a waitress, or to have the food remade.     As we were leaving,  we heard two ladies inform the staff at the hostess station that they were leaving because they waited for 20 minutes without being served.  The response? 'Oh,  that's too bad'.  The staff did not seem overly concerned.  We commiserated with those two patrons as we walked out together and they shared that they were heading to Panera.  In hindsight,  we should have too, the moment we saw the scene at the hostess station when we arrived.  There are enough dining options in the area now so I can safely say we will never be back to IHOP again.",

Our waiter was really nice, you can tell he was trying to do his best. Apparently the kitchen staff didn't know what to do. Got my coffee (which usually takes like 5 minutes) right before my food which probably took an hour. Again, the waiter kept apologizing and it wasn't his fault since he kept going back to check.

Before this IHOP was built, the last time I had been to an IHOP was in July 2010 when I visited my grandparents in Florida. I ordered the Fresh and Fruity Rooty Tooty Pancakes then, and I promised myself that next very next time I went to IHOP, I'd order the double chocolate chip pancakes, without fail.  Fast forward to 2014. I'm signed up on IHOP's emailer, and I get my coupon for a free short stack on my birthday. I asked if I could upcharge to the double chocolate chip pancakes, and my server said it was on the house.  I've gone back to this IHOP probably 6-7 times, and I've never had an issue here. I always order breakfast foods here, just because that's the kind of food I like. Plus, if I eat pancakes, I can justify exercising that day (although IHOP's pancakes are only about 200 calories each). My food is always hot, and the service is always at least average, considering the patronage that day.  I don't know if I'd order off the lunch or dinner menu here; I really don't. Do they still have country fried steak as an entree? I might go ahead with this once just to say I did it.  Eat 'n' Park makes a good pancake. Shop 'n' Save makes a good pancake. Bob Evans can make a good pancake depending on the day. I don't know about Perkins; don't care. IHOP makes a FANTASTIC breakfast meal, and they're worth the drive from Cranberry if you ask this obese man.  Review #175.",

As soon as we entered we noticed many different groups of people needing to be seated with plenty of seats we also noticed that the hostess stand was a mess. there were a few orders, menus scattered all over the place that were dirty, and they were writing names down to be seated on sheets of napkin.... when we did get seated we were given one menu to share. There was 2 of us. We sat for 30 minutes while several different servers walked right past us. Especially because we we were literally seated by the kitchen. When we did get someone's attention he took our order without writing it down, came back to hear it and write it again, then came back a third time to ask what kind of omelette my dad wanted. Three times we told him our order. During all this we asked for water and coffee. Which we didn't get either. The table next to us offered their coffee pot because they said they were leaving and we probably won't get ours for another 30 minutes. During this wait more people were cleaning tables than serving and taking orders. Priorities completely wrong at this place. When we asked our waiter again for our coffee and water he told us he was new and he doesn't know what to do. We know it's a management issue but come on first thing someone would at any bar restaurant etc is drinks and water. We get our drinks finally then the food comes, still no silverware so we wait again while our food sits. He comes back and we remind him about the silverware. He says no is clean right now. I'm likeeeeeeee.. okay?????? Why is he telling me this but when we could eat the food was good. So was coffee. Avocado on my omelette was hard and the waiter told me it's because they aren't ripe yet. (So why you serving them?) but food was decent. Terrible terrible poor service. And from our table we could hear the workers and cook and manager all yelling at each other in the kitchen. Someone telling the other to act like an effing adult and so on. Terrible. And I believe it all starts with the management. About 15 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off but not knowing what to start with first. I stayed and ate truly because i was curious how bad it could get from there. Honestly amazing",

The waiter finally arrived and we put in our drinks and food order in all together. Mind you, there were about 4-5 other tables and 2 other waitresses with about 2 tables each. We sat down at 12:58 PM and after 32 minutes of waiting for JUST the drinks (that never arrived) we decided to walk out and go somewhere else.  I would have totally understood the lack of service if it were to have been super packed but like I said, there were about 4-5 other tables there and 2 waitresses with 2 tables each. This isn't the first time it's happened but it is the last time we were giving this IHOP at this location another chance.",

Should have been a hint to just turn around and leave. Waitress finally comes to seat us, she was extremely nice but the whole experience went downhill from there. As soon as we actually got into the dining area, there was a stomach turning scent floating through the air (the bathroom smelt better) As we were sitting waiting for the waitress to come back, we noticed food all over the floor, looked as though a food fight had taken place prior to our arrival. There was a questionable substance smeared on the back of our booth. Hair hanging from the syrup container. During the middle of the meal we heard a brawl going down in the back between co-workers. Words being exchanged such as \"OH SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK!\" The bacon was stiff as a board. Questionable green thing on the French toast. Stomach hurt so bad afterwards. Never going to that location again.",

Generally, this location is very good, but we have had a few times where I felt the cook did not do their best effort on an order. An example of this can be seen in my picture of my Quick 2-Egg Breakfast. The plate was dripping in oil and the serving of hash browns was minimal at best. My husband ordered a salad and it was much more visually appealing than my breakfast plate. Pictures of both are included. The service is usually on point at this location with friendly servers who bring the orders and any follow-up requests in a timely fashion. There is plenty of parking, but the wheelchair ramp is not in front of IHOP. Unfortunately, it is down in front of another business. That means a step for folks who might find that difficult. Over all, I believe three stars is what IHOP rates as it's A-OK.",

One girl on a Friday night where a ton of people are headed to see the newest movies across the street. People just kept coming to pay while a line formed at host stand. Bad planning IHOP :/   Nathan was our server and he was a great server honestly. Very friendly and had a nice personality.   Bobby ordered the Colorado omelet with pancakes & a chocolate shake. He wasn't a fan of the pulled pork but overall enjoyed his meal. The shake was pretty small for $4.   I ordered the country omelet with pancakes (& coffee). The omelet had ham, shredded cheese and hash browns. It was huge. Coffee was good as well.  Average meal and awkward wait at the host stand makes me rate this IHOP 3 stars.",

This was only strange to be because other tables had regular glass cups. They must have been out of clean glass cups to give out.   I ordered two pancakes, two eggs, and two slices of bacon. My mother in law got the breakfast sampler, which came with a little bit of everything. My aunt in law, ordered eggs, toast, and hash browns. My man ordered a burger. My breakfast was okay. The pancakes were spectacular, my eggs, undercooked and still raw, and my bacon wasn't crisp how I usually like it. My man said there was nothing special about the burger, and my aunt was missing toast. The toast came not long after the waitress noticed it was missing. My aunt ended up not eating half her plate because it became cold and the toast was cold when it came to the table.   I gave 3 starts because I did enjoy the pancakes, but not the other breakfast items I ordered, and I credit our waitress for being so consistent in a busy environment. I kind of want to go back and try their specialty pancakes because the ones I did have were very good.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped at IHOP last weekend to try their new burgers. We got there around 11 AM and the place was pretty dead, with only a few of the tables filled.   We both ordered the classic burgers - mine with the \"special sauce\" on the side, and my husband's with just lettuce and tomato. It took over 25 minutes for our food to arrive and the orders weren't right. Both our burgers had the special sauce on it. My husband, who despises mayo and pickles (which were also incorrectly added to his burger), refused to eat his. I had mine and it was actually pretty good. Certainly not worth the 25 minute wait, but good. The closest comparison would be a Steak n Shake burger.   It should also be mentioned that the only time we saw our server was when she brought out our drinks. Someone else delivered our food and that was it. We never had our drinks refilled and had to ask someone else for the check. The customers at the table behind us had the same issue with their server.   At a certain point in the meal, a very nice gentleman (whose name I should have gotten) came over and asked how everything was. When my husband told him about his burger, he offered to make him a new one to-go. We were hesitant because we didn't want to wait another half hour, but the guy said it would only be a few minutes so we accepted. My husband enjoyed the second burger, but I doubt we'll be back any time soon.",

    "text": "Nope. Nope. Nope.  Awful service Meh food Did I mention the awful service?  Went for a mid-morning weekday breakfast. It was pretty empty as expected. Weird set up to wait for a table.  An older couple ahead of me was seated by a hostess and rather than wait for her to come back a waitress seated me herself but didn't mark down the blotter thing. Maybe she wasn't getting enough tables from the hostess and took matters into her own hands? But if you do that you should, oh, I don't know, be better at your job?   I hadn't even gotten seated when she asked if I wanted coffee, I said no but she left the pot on the (small) table. Okay then. I needed time since the menu is really large but she took about 10 minutes to come back. That's a bit too long, I assumed she forgot about me. Ordered and the coffee finally was moved. The food came, not hot, maybe luke warm, not worth sending it back. Interesting that the check came right afterwards too, then nothing, no check in, no water refill. The food was okay, nothing great. Weirdly enough the pancakes were the least satisfying part. I was pretty surprised how unimpressive they tasted. I took my time to pay the bill waiting until I was done eating and that was the fastest part of the entire meal, swooped up that card right away. Before I could sign the bill she came back to take it from me, she saw I didn't sign it, took the pen and....never returned!  What is that about? I assume she figured it out when she came back to my table and saw it was totally blank!   You'd think this would be two-star since in the end I got edible food but here is the problem. I noticed a man seated near me and he got NO service for well over 10 minutes. Not even a drink order. He asked another waitress if someone would help him and she said it wasn't her table....and walked away. No apology, no getting a manager to get an unhappy customer taken care of. Just 'not my problem' attitude. It's not packed so is taking on another table going to be the end of the world? I watched him as he looked around in disbelief because how is that even possible to have experienced this, stood up, looked around again, and walked out.   It's IHOP, there isn't anything here you can't make yourself for a lot less money. But you go out to eat not just to not cook but also to have a nice experience. That's not happening here.",

    "text": "Paet 1 of 2 parts. We went to the mccandless pa location.The service is absolutely terrible here and I mean we went in to  packed lobby and did not see the host or hostess (there were 2) for ten whole minutes. Then when the host guy came up to the desk he looked at a paper and walked right back to the dining area and * did not even look at any of us or say a word* to the 25 or 30 people in the lobby. He walks away , then the hostess comes in *and does the same exact thing*.  They're out bussing tables instead of seating people.... This customer begins taking the clipboard and writing every parties name on it in order of how we came in so the 2 idiots would be a step ahead. Then  the next trip in by the host guy and a Hispanic lady has to practically yell full volume hey you this guy is writing your customers names down on a list for you to help you out. He rolls his eyes and walks off indifferent. Not a word was said by him. finally they begin seating people ...this is after sitting there 20 minutes. Half an hour goes by we sit down finally then discover half of the restaurant tables are empty and clean...so we waited FOR NOTHING, BUT because of THEIR STUPIDITY. and had they both been at the desk, they could have had all the parties seated with in ten minutes of entering the lobby.The one hostess goes but they all want booths. Ok sweetheart here is where you OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND USE YOUR PEA BRAIN TO SAY *** WE DONT HAVE ANY BOOTHS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE TABLES OPEN IMMEDIATELY IF YOU WANT SEATED RIGHT AWAY.  *** INSTEAD THE IDIOTS LET US ALL WAIT TIL THEY RAN AROUND CLEARING OFF DIRTY DISHES OFF OF  ALL THE BOOTHS WHILE REGULAR TABLES WERE WIDE OPEN EMPTY... . Both the busboys were worthless The WHOLE PLACE HAD NO MANAGEMENT,  NO LEADERSHIP, NO ORGANIZATION, NO INTELLIGENCE , no skills , AND NOT A FREAKING CLUE HOW TO WORK A RESTAURANT... then we get seated, no clue who our wait staff is, usually a hostess will say so and so will be serving you and will be with you shortly. Not a word. So we see this waitress she looks directly at us and walks right by. So we sit another 10 or 15 minutes and the very same waitress shows up. Then takes our order and asks if we want cream with our coffee we said yes. Ten more minutes go by. The hostess asks did any body come by your table yet?!?!?! . As if 45 minutes of waiting is OK to not be served yet. This guy and his kid WHO WERE 5 PEOPLE BEHIND US IN LINE IN THE LOBBY HAS HIS FOOD WELL BEFORE WE DO. AT THIS POINT IM FUMING. Of course that guy had a different  waiter  that had a brain evidently .This is 45 minutes of waiting so far...  so the waitress never comes back with the creamer. So I see her walk past and I said excuse me she walks past us and ignores us. . Of course we have no silverware. Another ten minutes. We get silverware.  A different party that was behind us gets their food. Then she comes back with our food ...this is at an hours wait time. Heres the kicker... we get my sons food, its correct. My wife ordered a spinach omelet the waitress brought a garden vegetable omelette. My wife said that's not what I ordered. The waitress then said i thought you ordered this. So instead of taking the plate back(and admitting she screwed up) she stands  there like a statue and expects us to take it. My wife says i ordered spinach omelette. She goes ya you ordered two platters right?  im thinking are you mental ? But my wife kicks me under the table so I shut up So my wife just took both platters to keep the peace... On top of that we have six pancakes two plates of 3 plain pancakes  each.  But we didnt order ANY plain  pancakes .... I ordered 1 order of blueberry pancakes. None of the plain pancakes. Then my stuffed French toast comes. But i also ordered a 2x2x2 platter which is 2 sausage 2 bacon 2 eggs and hash browns. It never came. So I tell her that and that I also ordered blueberry pancakes. she gets a dazed look on her face and leaves. 2 minutes later I get scrambled eggs- without the cheese I asked her to add on top of them, 1 bacon, 1 sausage, 1 hashbrown. The platter should have had 2 of each....2x2x2 was the name....Then the blueberry pancakes come. We eat , get a 51 dollar bill. Half of it for food we didnt even order , mind you....she brings three boxes no bag.  . So horrible service , totally understaffed. Totally chaotic haphazard operation with  brainless service and a total joke of an establishment. I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN WORSE SERVICE AND DISJOINTED  UNTRAINED CLUELESS EMPLOYEES OR THIS BAD OF AN OUTFIT IN MY 53 YEARS OF LIFE.  The food is excellent please understand they have great food. The waitstaff the hosts and hostess and the rest of the places employees are brainless zombies... I cannot believe that this place hasn't gone out of business with such horrible service.",
