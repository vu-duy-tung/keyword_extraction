    "text": "My fiance & I tried take out dinner about a month ago. We were excited to try it, since Bellevue doesn't have many options to choose from! We started with the fried zucchini...it was pretty bizarre. I could tell the flavors were good but it was so soft & soggy that it was basically inedible. I had the pesto chicken sandwich. The pesto, bun & cheese were good though the chicken was very disappointing. It was a really thick piece of chicken and it was pretty flavorless. I get that the pesto adds flavor but the chicken itself needed SOMETHING! My fiance had the pulled pork sandwich, he said it was just ok. I can't speak for the service, as my fiance did the ordering/picking up. Overall, we were disappointed with our meal, especially for the price. We could have gone to Wendy's & had something with better flavor for a lot less $$. I really don't think we will go back. I hope that they work on the quality of their menu, we really wanted a new place to go!",

Yesterday I went there for lunch. There was one table with 4 people at the table. They had drinks and looked like they were waiting for their food. No other customers in the place. I sat down.  The waitress (I am assuming she was), was (1 ) talking on the phone at the bar then (2) came out into the dining area for God knows what, never acknowledging me,  (3) goes back to the bar area and makes a phone call (4) comes back into the dining area to hang some sort of sign on the door between bar and dining area, again never acknowledging me. I sat there for 5 more minutes and got up and left.  I could have almost understood it, if they were busy, but they were not.  This is not how you treat customers. Like  I said, the food is so so, but the service is terrible. I will never go back",

    "text": "I have been following this place since Bellevue passed the referenudm to have their first bar establishments, but I haven't actually gone here yet. It was a Saturday night in September.  There was a band playing next door and concert goers drinking Pabst.  We had dinner inside. I was extremely impressed by the fried seasoned pita with spinach artichoke dip.  The pita itself was unlike anything I've had, and the cheesy spinach artichoke dip was in the top 5 I have had.  I love that stuff.  Mozzarella sticks were perfect and pretty huge, and came with a unique thick sauce to dip that was richer than any side to dip you would get elsewhere.  Dozen hot wings - was pretty decent..properly fried, fairly basic sauce (a little mild, though) but topped with light parm (pigeonwings style) which delighted me, since that is my favorite kind of wing serving.  Entree was the Pittsburgh sandwich, which exceeded all of the other styles of this sandwich from all other places.  Got the corned beef variant.  It came out as a DOUBLE DECKER Pittsburgh style sandwich.  The coleslaw was perfect.  This is my new favorite place of all to get that sandwich over Parmanti's.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday with my father for lunch.  Before we even got into the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was an application for a liquor license in the window.  Seeing how Bellevue used to be a dry town this is somewhat exciting.  Whenever we got inside the restaurant at right around 11:20 we were immediately seated.  At this point there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant.  There's not too much to say about the inside of this place.  There are lots of tables and chairs and 2 flat screen tv's in different corners.  While my father and I were there they both had the Price Is Right on them which I found to be a bit odd.  For my lunch entree I decided on the pesto chicken sandwich with fries while my dad went with the fish sandwich.  It arrived a short time later and we both dug into our food. My entree consisted of some chicken, lettuce, red onion and pesto all on a focaccia bun.  The sandwich ended up having great flavor, mostly on the back of the pesto.  While the focaccia made the sandwich a little different, the bottom of it became soggy while I was eating the sandwich and it started falling apart by the end.  The chicken on the sandwich also seemed to be a bit over cooked and wasn't as juicy as I would have liked.  Even with all of that being said I enjoyed the sandwich because the pesto was that good.  The fries that came with the sandwich seemed to be a bit under seasoned and while I couldn't see any visible grease on them, by the time I was finished eating them my fingers were coated.  Whenever I asked my dad about his sandwich he said that he enjoyed it and the breading on the fish was good.  He only wished there was better ratio of breading to fish as he felt like he was eating more breeding than fish a decent amount of the time.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  I really enjoyed the pesto on my sandwich and feel like a few minor changes could have made it amazing.",

We walked in, and on the TVs was a station known for its fair and balanced reporting. Unless an establishment is a sports bar, there's no reason for a television in a dining room. But it's not a sports bar, because we're in dry Bellevue. So turn the tv off!  But was this a dining room? Or an office? Because on a table in the back were two laptops and paper, like it was someone's desk. I was coming to a restaurant to forget where I've been all day.  As we were eating, a big guy with stained T-shirt came out of the kitchen to interview potential waitresses, within hearing range. Their experience was Eatn'Park, where we would have experienced actually a more interesting and creative menu. The food was fine but nothing exciting.  It's really too bad, because the general atmosphere is nice and the food isn't terrible. It's just short of being the kind of restaurant that Bellevue so desperately needs.",

Crab cakes have a great flavor and not alot of breading, which I like. Steak was great too, cooked as ordered medium rare and served hot and fresh, and you have to love the hand cut fries, kindof potato patch style. I also heard they're going to be getting  a liquor license for Bellevue, which will immediately make this place THE place to go in Bellevue.

We sat ourselves per the sign and were greeted quickly with a drink order taken. They have a small alcohol list with your basic beers and liquors, so I had a Heineken.   For appetizers, my cousin and his wife got the nachos, and my partner and I got the stuffed banana peppers and mozzarella sticks. The nachos were home made tortilla chips covered in...pizza toppings. Pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. It sounded interesting enough to try, but even as a pizza fan and big lover of nachos, this was a big miss. The chips themselves were good but the toppings were too mismatched with the base. My cousin and his wife liked them though. The sausage in the stuffed banana peppers was so spicy it wasn't enjoyable. The mozzarella sticks were good.  For dinner, my kids got spaghetti and the kids chicken strip basket. My son barely touched his spaghetti, which is one of his favorite meals, but he ate all of the bread. I had the Parmesan crusted salmon, which was entirely flavorless, with a baked potato that was undercooked. The salad was fine. My partner had the ribeye; he ordered it medium rare, which it was, but he said it was the worst steak he'd ever eaten. No seasoning, not even salt, no flavor, just very not good.   My cousin and his wife seemed to like what they got, they or they just didn't complain. We don't plan to return. The service was fine, but the food was really unsatisfying.",

    "text": "Bellevue holds some hidden gems when it comes to eateries.  I'm not talking about that strip of Ohio River Blvd that most people think of when they hear Bellevue, I'm talking about this stretch on Lincoln Ave that holds some great places to eat.  Grille 565 just happens to be one of those places.  When it comes to spontaneous food choices I'm not good at it, I'll usually double guess myself and end up somewhere else that I have already been too.  I am glad that I went outside of my comfort zone a bit and ventured in here.  When we arrived there wasn't very many people inside.  It is a well lit area with ample seating.  At the time we visited we were able to seat ourselves and we chose a table near the front windows.  Gave us a view of the street while taking in everything they have inside.  We were greeted, placed our drink order and looking at the menu in no time.  They offer a wide array of meals to satisfy just about anyone that steps foot in their door.  We started with their take on spinach artichoke dip.  They use provolone cheese as the cheese which, I have to say, worked quite nicely.  They also describe that this comes with enough pita triangles to share, they didn't lie on that one.  This easily could have been a meal unto itself, but it is definitely great for sharing.  I had been looking back and forth at a few items but ended up going with the TLBT or was it TBLT.  Whatever it is listed as on the menu, it was what I wanted at that moment.  This is your basic BLT with some turkey slapped in there.  The bread was lightly toasted, just enough to hold everything on the inside.  The lettuce was shredded which guaranteed you were going to get some in each bite.  The tomato was just the rich thickness for a sandwich this size.  The turkey tasted as if it was fresh cut for the sandwich.  The only thing I would have changed about this was the bacon.  Not the fact that bacon was on it, but I would have cooked the bacon just a little longer.  It wasn't crispy enough for me for a BLT.  My better half had a burger with bacon on it and he agrees with me on that one.    Loved the fries!  Fresh cut and thrown in the grease.  Love a good fry that is just cut.  You can't get anything better than that.    Service was great and we were checked on regularly.  The crowd here seems to be more of the community than any other place I have been to in the city.",

The barbecue sauce had really good flavor, the burger was cooked exactly how I wanted (medium well), and the bacon was crispy. I got fries on the side and they were great as well.   The service was also very good. When you walk in the sign says to seat yourself, it was a nice night so we told the waitress we wanted to sit outside and then went and grabbed a table. I was a little nervous service might be lacking because we were the only ones out there but I was pleasantly surprised! We had a few waitresses come out and check on us and they were all very nice. They brought us waters right away and our food also came out fairly quick once we ordered.   I really enjoyed my experience and I will be going back!",

The most recent time, we brought our 1.5 year old with us, and our server was SO WONDERFUL to her.  It was great, and I love feeling comfortable being able to bring our daughter out to dinner with us.   The best thing about this place is that they have alcohol.  They were the first place to get a liquor license when Bellevue voted to end their prohibition.  It's great being able to walk somewhere to get dinner and a drink.  Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to check out their live entertainment, but I would love to do that at some point.",

They then asked their mom to make us snacks so she set up a nacho/taco bar for us! Cost $5 for unlimited and margaritas were $4. Can't beat that! Also had one of the regulars telling us jokes haha",

The food was edible, but that's about it. My husband ordered a ribeye and I had the Louisiana pork chop. While the steak was cooked well, it was not really seasoned at all. The pork was overdone and chewy and the bbq sauce wasn't anything that I'd want to eat again. The mashed potato was basically just potato (no cream or butter or any flavor). My husband and I ate our kids chicken fingers, which were probably the best item out of all our food... and likely a freezer item. I will say, my starter salad was good, and well presented. My husband's broccoli cheddar soup... meh, just another canned item maybe? Another interesting note, they have a kids menu, but no kids cups? They just brought a plastic bar cup of milk with no lid. Maybe their bar food and burgers are better, but I wouldn't go back to try. Hate to leave a review like this but it was surprisingly poor all around.",

Nachos are something different and everyone that has gotten them has raved about them.    All in all, worth it to visit Bellevue downtown.",

The obvious response, and what he said \"All the way\" Now, I don't know if they would have actually made him a rare turkey burger, but the waitress then says that they have people order them different all the time... I hope that it is just this waitress that is confused, but please people order your turkey well done...",

They have a large chalkboard in the dining area announcing upcoming events.  We noticed that a psychic night is planned in October but reservations are requested.  Our server was very attentive and is very excited to be part of the upcoming changes that will occur once their liquor license is in place.  The lower level features live music as scheduled.

    "text": "Revised on 2015/02/15  Saturday  For an evening with family, the event was flawless.  Easy parking on the street at this time of evening (7 pm), greeted at the door and escorted downstairs to our reserved tables.  Manager's suggestion was excellent.  Menu, both upstairs and downstairs is the same.  Both comedy acts were excellent -- everyone enjoyed them both.  Wait service was as good as it gets, but they do need to add one person to the mix when every seat in the downstairs area is full.  Mark, the owner/manager came by our table to say hello -- nice courtesy.    656 will be doing monthly comedy shows apparently.  This should be a success if robustly advertised.   A Blues for Youth event is coming up shortly.  They flyers on the wall announcing events is helpful, but I would give everyone who comes in a paper flyer of upcoming events as well -- a walk/take away as a reminder.  A useful addition to the place would be a couple of variable power LED lights on the ceiling in front of the stage, or even on the back wall set to \"skim\" across the ceiling to open up the stage visually.  Just a touch of additional lumen power would enhance that performance space significantly.  Bellevue has a nice event and restuarant.  565 is a BYOB place -- which makes an evening rather inexpensive compared to the full bar service at others with a small glass of chard pegged at $6.  I am sure we will be back again.  A fun evening for all.  f8 and be there.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  One visit thus far; tomorrow 7 us are going back for a comedy act that will perform.  Menu is basic American.  Hamburger was credible; fries tasty.  Just hanging out there waiting for a business meeting later in the afternoon.  Not crowded but it was daytime.  Waiter was excellent; coffee unending.    I've now used their online booking system for obtaining seats at the show.  Worked perfectly.  Indeed \"Mark\" even sent email back to my account and we talked a bit about where the group could be seated.  Our seats are reserved.  This is a nice touch since many places with music or other performances, smaller places, just let one fend for themself when they show up.  This is a nice courtesy.  Will follow up on this after the show re our dinner, and the ambience.  f8 and be there",

    "text": "Tried the two-month-old Grille 565 in Bellevue today.  And, it was pretty good.  Which is a relief - Bellevue needs a restaurant like this!    565 is basically a medium sized local American restaurant.  Diner-esque food and prices. Lots of sandwiches, apps, a few salads, some vegetarian options, and different meats and potatoes.  BYOB (Bellevue is a dry town).  Fresh, not frozen, vegetables were a great surprise!  The bread is Mancini's or a similar local fresh bakery offering.  Hand-cut fries, which were awesome, as was the medium-low price of the meal.  Great service too!  It's a brand new joint, so I plan on updating my review when they are more established.  I will say that there is a bit of work that needs done... ie. sprucing up of the bathroom (it didn't look dirty, but wasn't sparkling either), a light or fan was removed from the ceiling and wires were out in the open (not dangerous, but unsightly), and the blinds on the side of the room near the entrance to the kitchen need replaced with curtains or something. Basically, some cosmetic work needs to happen. Also, while we were dining, the door to the kitchen was wide open, and the tv's were all playing Sponge Bob.  I saw the owner and what appeared to be his young daughter, who was watching the cartoon.  I get it, but I'm personally not a fan of tv's in a restaurant.  Overall though, with a bit of work and decorating, I can see this being a successful local restaurant.    It's a great start!  I wish this place luck.",
