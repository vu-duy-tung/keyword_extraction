Our server seemed more like an Eat-N-Park waitress dressed like a prostitute than a steward of fine libations. I think I had the \"Blind Tiger\" which was fine, but not better than cocktails I make at home and not worth the wait.",

When I arrived to meet my boyfriend and his friend, Dawn was explaining to them about the gin rickey cocktail and the gimlet. I started asking her more about the gimlet and said in hadn't had cheery in a gimlet ever. I then proceeded to look at the menu and then informed Dawn I had made my choice. She looked at me and said \"let me guess\". After a few seconds of her feeling into my selection and personality she said \"apricot gimlet\". By golly she was right! Dawn has that magical bartender intuition that only someone who understands people and well thought out crafted cocktails could have.  After being there for a 15 minutrs or so, she brought us complimentary warm spiced almonds. The apricot gimlet was very nice, not too atrong or sweet, it was balanced and refreshing. also makes a nice old fashioned. We will be going back because to Dawn.",

I had the Egg Flip as well as the Orange/Lemon Old Tom Cobbler.  Both great.  The Cobbler tasted so refreshing it would have been a great beach drink.  We also got a Charcuterie board which was good, but wasn't a fan of the Pate (and I usually like Pate)  I never knew this place existed until my friend showed it to me.  I'm so glad I know about it now.  I feel like I'm giving up this secret gem.  A place for great drinks and conversation.",

There is something special about the tipsy feeling resulting from drinks made with painstaking care and fine ingredients. Our waiter is always exceptionally courteous and cordial. Our owners previously had a really special Mother's Day that ended at the Speakeasy, instantly making a lasting memory for grandma and our owners. It is always so much fun to share a hidden gem of a destination like this to a loved one. Our owners will come way more often when they start making millions of dollars off of internet videos of our hilarious antics. Until then, our owners can only justify getting $10+ drinks a few times a year. Meow.",

Both of us got the punch which doesn't actually need to be made. At around 25 minutes of waiting, the server came up to our table saying the bartender was going to get a refill on the punch... Yes, 25 minutes later. When the drinks showed up, they were two different ones when we both ordered the same thing. Keep in mind we are approaching about 35 minutes for two punch drinks. We figured we should ask for our tab because it was obviously going to take a while to get it. 20 minutes later our tab comes and without looking, I give him my card because I didn't have the patience any more. The credit card slip came and I was charged $26 for two $9 drinks. As I said my patience were depleted so I didn't bother to dispute the charge. All of this could have been changed if the server would have acknowledged the long wait time but he didn't in any way. I won't be returning to Speakeasy.",

I thought that was odd since this was a place that was supposed to specialize in prohibition style cocktails, but after I ordered my first drink I realized why.  I got an old fashioned that was hands down the worst old fashioned I have ever had, everything was off about it including the bar tender shoving about half an orange in it. Next up I got a Tom Collins and when it arrived it was black, I have never seen this before and the drink itself was horrendous. Nothing that goes into a Tom Collins would make the drink black.  I heard other patrons complain to the bartender about their drinks not being right and she would dismiss their concerns immediately and say things like you probably never had this style of drink before. This place really needs to hire a bartender that is passionate and knows about making these type of drinks. Bottom line if you are looking for a prohibition style drink avoid this place there are places like Acacia or Butcher in the Rye that are a million times better.",

Unfortunately we were turned away 20 minutes before closing despite being guests of the hotel and dressed in business attire. We were not some dudes in ball caps going in to grab a few bottles of Bud and think we are big time. Nor were we prima donnas seeking to have the entire staff stay past 11 so we could milk our one cocktail. With 20 minutes to go - the staff could have politely informed us that it was last call.  Plenty of time for everyone to do it right.  We could have joined the 8-9 other customers and all would have left at closing. Instead we were turned away with the bum's rush and we  never considered the place again in our remaining evenings in the city.  I know it's hard being in the service business near the end of a shift. However - that's part of the job. Try coming up with a solution that allows you to serve the customer without breaking the system rather than ending a potentially positive relationship before it begins.",

It is in the basement of the William Penn Hotel and was apparently originally a real speakeasy during prohibition.  I talked to the bartender a bit and found out that the place was not even discovered until about a year ago when they found a False wall during hotel renovations!  There were also three unopened bottles of liquor dating from the early 1900's that are now on display.  The drinks are all reminiscent of 1920 style cocktails.  Very cool.  Don't expect your drink fast, these bartenders know what they are doing and take their time making your drink look and taste perfect.  Waiting is easy though when the surroundings that you are in are very well done and there is old fashion music playing throughout.  I would definitely go back here though.  Be careful how many drinks you order here.  There prices are quite expensive.",

    "text": "Excited about another first review!  Met up with a friend here for cocktails during the Christmas break.  True to form for speakeasies, you have to go down a set of stairs to enter the bar.  Granted down a staircase in one of most ornate hotels in the downtown and is well lit and plush.  Overall first impression of the venue is that it's decorated very nicely; however they need to tone down the lighting, I would say by half to get  a real speakeasy feeling.  Drink prices are right on par with some of the priciest joints in San Francisco so it will be interesting to see how well it does for the next few months.  $14 for a Manhattan is just too much for this market.  I don't even pay that much for some of the best Manhattans in San Francisco (Burrit Room, House of Shields, etc)  Service was great.  George was a doll and very attentive to our group.  Drinks, just one round were decent, I had a hot buttered rum kind of drink, but the one I had a bit later at Meat & Potato was much tastier.  So it's just the early stages and I think they'll get their groove on as the months pass and I'll keep it in my radar for future visits to da Burgh.",

    "text": "Being a parent of three, the babysitter situations don't always become available as often as Mama and I would like.  When the opportunities do arise for a grown-ups only date night, I need to make the most of it to ensure I get another date night in the near future - if you get my gist.  Lets add to that challenge by having date night on Valentines Day, dinner at a restaurant we have never tried, and after dinner drinks at a place neither of us had ever heard of.  Now that the scene of this story has been set and the bar has been set to 'impress the little lady or sleep with the dog tonight' we begin at the William Penn Hotel at the doors of the Speakeasy.  When we arrived, we were met by a very friendly gentleman who promptly informed us, in a very apologetic manner, that he was at capacity and couldn't let us in.  Thinking that this was simply part of the experience, we figured we needed a password.  When 'Capone is a two-bit hooch jockey' and 'twenty-FOUR skadoo' didn't work, we regrouped for a quick powder.  After loitering around in the hallway and pretending to be interested in the wall paper, all the while watching the 'bouncer' gently reject large groups of finely dressed Monopoly Men and trophy wives, we got in and were seated right at the bar.  Immediately upon entering, you felt a different atmosphere in the joint, but not in a bad way.  The room was warmer than in the hall and you could feel that this was a place that was never intended to be occupied, much like a hide-away that would have been ideal for a prohibition party.  The lights were low, and big band, swing, and jazz music were playing setting the soundtrack for the night.   Groups were seated around small tables in velvet lined chairs, sipping period-inspired drinks like Rob-Roys, Gibsons, and MONhattans.  Couples at the bar enjoyed trying new drinks and overlapping the experience with new friends, all the while preserving the close, intimate conversation or to simply wind down at after a raucous evening of fast-paced stunt-swing dancing!  The entire experience to this point was made complete by Dawn, the bartender, who not only made us feel very welcome, but she took our picture to preserve the memory.  Dawn took the time to tell us about the menu, the history of the room, and we marveled watching her mix drinks.  After reviewing the menu, Mama and I each opted for Moscow Mules with the house blend, citrus infused vodka and slapped rosemary.  Slapped rosemary?  As unconventional as us 'nightlife rubes' thought that was, it presented a wonderful flavor to an amazing drink.  Before we knew it, we were engaged in conversation and being able to complete thoughts without being asked for a snack (parents know what I'm talking about).  We didn't try any food, hence I'm only compelled to give four stars.  I'm sure when we make it back, that will be raised to five, especially since I had my eye on the duck charcuterie and Mama wants to taste absinthe.  So as we close out our evening and head back to reality Mama and I both agreed that the Speakeasy was the perfect place to close out a romantic evening...and yes, the dog slept alone!!",

    "text": "My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary in Pittsburgh and we're staying at the Omni. We wandered down to the Speakeasy around 10pm and had to wait in a short line to get in, since the bar can only hold so many people at a time. We waited about 10 minutes and were let in. I ordered a Speakeasy Scotch and my wife had a Tom Collins. As we waited for our drinks, I took in the ambience. It's pretty cool in the Speakeasy and was a nice semi-intimate place for drinks to close out the evening. Got our drinks after a short wait, which was forgivable since it was a busy Saturday night. My Speakeasy Scotch was great and heavy on the scotch (thank you) and my wife's Tom Collins had pineapple in it -- different than the advertised Maraschino Cherries in the menu. We left after one round of drinks which turned out to be just fine. I know all hotel bars are expensive, but we paid more for our two drinks here than we did at Primanti Bros for our entire meal the next day. There are certainly cheaper bars to drink at in the city, but the Speakeasy isn't a bad choice if you're at the Omni and don't feel like venturing out into the city.",

    "text": "I have been to speakeasy bars all over the country...Patterson House, The Violet Hour, Please Don't Tell, etc.  This, my friends, is NOT a speakeasy. This is a hotel bar.  I should have known based on the fact that \"speakeasy\" was emblazoned on the door of the bar.  My husband and I decided to have a nightcap after a fabulous night of dinner and drinks at Meat and Potatoes (highly recommend).  We found this \"speakeasy\" on the bottom floor of our hotel and were elated!  We entered and were excited to try the offerings.  After careful consideration, we went with the Pims Cup and a Whiskey concoction which I forget the name.  My husband's drink was $17, so needless to say, he was excited to try it.  The Pim's Cup was a very reasonable $8.50.  We received our drinks after about 15 minutes.  My Pim's cup was served in a wine glass.  It was a dark red and topped with a plethora of fruit (apples, blackberry, ect).  I double checked when our server set it down to make sure I didn't receive someone's sangria.  Our server informed me that it was, in fact, a Pim's Cup.  It was awful.  Tasted like soda water.  My husband (a devout Bourbon drinker from Louisville) said his drink tasted like licorice with no hint of whiskey what so ever.  We contemplated what to do.  We are not used to sending back drinks, but this was ridiculous.  We couldn't choke them down.  We spoke with the server and let him know that we were unhappy with our drinks.  He was visibly dismayed.  My husband asked for an Old Fashioned and I passed for fear of getting another subpar drink.  We heard the bartender speaking ill of the couple that sent back drinks and telling other patrons she takes pride in her drinks.  We were mortified.  We waited 20 minutes and still, my husband had not been served his Old Fashioned.  It was embarrassing and infuriating at the same time.  We decided to leave since we felt very unwelcome.  This is quite possibly the worst bar experience we have ever had.  I warn all patrons accustomed to a certain level of craftsmanship and service when it comes to beverages to stay away.  There are much better places in this city to enjoy an artfully crafted cocktail.",

Seemed to be straight out of the prohibition era. Everything made me feel like I had stepped back a hundred years, down to the old-style drink menus, hand-stitched with leather covers. And jazz music. The drinks themselves are modeled after popular cocktails of the time. They were delicious and service was exceptional. What a cool place!",

    "text": "The Speakeasy is a small bar in the Omni William Penn Hotel. It is a really small place, but has a nice ambiance about it. The lounge area is setup for small intimate parties, and the bartenders come out to provide personal service to the tables as well as the bar. The lighting is low and the art is reminiscent of a 20's speakeasy.  I went there with a few colleagues and a client after a day or meetings and dinner. It was a pretty nice spot for a Thursday afternoon. Quiet and personal. Between us we had the Moscow Mules, which come in a regular and citrus version. I had one of each and they were both outstanding. My colleagues had a Gin Rickey and Manhattan, both of which were very good according to those imbibing. This was also one of the few places I have been to that has Absinthe (a favorite of mine) and also has the cold water fountain to go along with it, though they are loathe to use it.   I did have two issues with the place though. One was that the drink menu had mostly complicated drinks that take many steps to complete. The drink orders were very slow to arrive after placing. I was typically ordering my next drink when my current was only 1/2 done. Also, it was very easy to hear everyone else conversation. While there was only a few people there at the time, had it been busier I expect it would have been pretty loud, which does not fit with the ambiance if you ask me. Also, a larger crowd would have slowed down the service even more.",

The drinks were ok, but again, only in my opinion, not really that interesting or satisfying.  The time to make a drink is very slow & when it's not busy, hard to understand why.  I ordered a gibson & got an old fashioned so then re-ordered and that was slow coming, too!   It was o.k. The Jack Collins was meh.  The cobblers were lots of muddled fruit & tasty, but hard to drink.  The decor is... meh & the lights were glaring to me.  I didn't get the bare halogen lights strung across the ceiling.  The seating is odd...  Long banquette style benches along the wall, but no real separation and then only footstools and an inconvenient low table.  A couple of four-tops and one two top with big wing chairs in a little alcove, a small, awkward seating area coming in from the entry.  I think the space would be great for an intimate event or gathering, but not really conducive to a 2-3 people coming in and being comfortable or feeling like they're in a speakeasy.  I also think they should limit the music to prohibition-era styles/tunes.  Much more appropriate.  I also think they should have a smart-casual dress code.  That would make it much more of an experience than just seeing everyone in flip-flops & sloppy t-shirts.  I'm sorry if I'm being picky.  I love this hotel & I'm glad they have a space like this, I just think it could be soooo much more!",

Good cocktails take a while to make, so be patient!",

I like the quiet and intimate environment and the crafty cocktails that all good speakeasies offer.  Sadly, Pittsburgh only has a small handful of these speakeasies.  Speakeasy is one of the former speakeasies that was restored from the Prohibition Era.  It's located in the basement of the Omni William Penn Hotel.  I wish the entrance was a little more hidden to recreate the experience of entering a speakeasy.  The doors are labeled Speakeasy, which is obviously a dead giveaway.  Service was also lacking despite a small crowd.  There was a 10-15 minute wait for our drinks.  Otherwise, the interior and the drinks were spot on.  We were able to sink into their velvet armchairs in a semi-private nook and sip on our Oktoberfest and Apricot Sparkling Gimlet, letting the night swallow us in.",

The reason I give this only 3 stars is because the service was poor and the bartenders do not do well at making these cocktails that are on their menu. The back bar was in total disarray and there were dirty dishes everywhere. If someone can get in there with great mixologists and knowing how to organize the liquor behind the bar and get someone to wash dishes, this place will be True hotspot for Pittsburgh! I hope it works out, because they have a perfect location in a beautiful hotel!",

While the space is comfortable enough, everything else is off, starting with the faux red velvet rope experience at the door. Ordered a Sazerac, expecting a classic cocktail presentation using a few local spirits. What I got was a watery over sweet mess garnishes with limp bits of lemon and orange peel and a licorice candy that the server said was meant to accent the anise notes in the drink. What?? If you're going to charge $17 in Pittsburgh for a cocktail, which is ridiculous on its own, at least execute a classic correctly. I expect there are some worthy cocktail bars in this city. The Speakeasy is not one of them.",

The drinks are delicious and strong.  If you want to try an appetizer along, I recommend their pesto mozzarella.  Speakeasy is one of my favorite spots to grab a fancy drink.

It's located in a well-lit basement of the Omni William Penn Hotel with the name (\"speakeasy\") branded all over the door. Also, a speakeasy named \"speakeasy\", really? To me, this place has more of a hotel basement bar feel than an actual speakeasy. We ordered the mescal old fashioned and the apricot sparkling gimlet. Between these two drinks, I recommend the mescal old fashioned if you're looking for something with a more unique taste, and the apricot sparkling gimlet if you're looking for something more refreshing. I personally prefers the mescal old fashioned over the apricot sparkling gimlet. The cayenne simple syrup in the drink definitely gives it a really nice kick, while the gimlet tastes a bit underwhelming to me. Drinks were about $15/each if cost is a concern of yours. We had no complaints in regards to service, though our drinks took awhile to come out despite the place being almost empty.",

It was a nice relaxing night, great conversation and charcuterie board (special of the week) was a wonderful pairing. I also tried their Manhattan (my normal go-to) and it was equally well made.   Only negative is that I feel like this place would be a hit or miss and you can't really plan to go there. By the time we left at 9 pm on a Thursday they were at max capacity (47 people - due to fire codes).

The Speakeasy at the Omni William Penn is perfect for groups and special occasions and I've never had a subpar experience here.

This is one of the few bars in the city that really offers the \"speakeasy vibe\" that I'm usually looking for in a bar, as well as the caliber of classic cocktails (Old Fashioneds, Manhattans, Vieux Carres, etc.)   * Parking: Street parking downtown can be a little tricky unless you come late at night; hotel valet is always an option though.  * Pro Tip: The Speakeasy doesn't offer reservations, so having to wait on a crowded night is a possibility, but thankfully I've been lucky (and usually come late night) and have never had to wait.",

    "text": "Wow, what an incredibly cool bar hidden away at the William Penn hotel! My friend recommended this place and we stopped by after attending Pittsburgh's Beerfest last weekend. Needless to say I didn't have a lot to drink here after being at Beerfest all evening- but I did sample a few of my friend's cocktails and they were fabulous. The service here was excellent and the ambiance could not be cozier. This spot was an actual speakeasy back in the day, making it an even more unique experience. I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Oh, such a super fun concept, deftly executed, with some caveats.  It is indeed quiet, relaxing, and super chill. It doesn't quite have the actual 'speakeasy' feel like some modern speakeasy style places I've been to (with hidden entrances, fake passwords, etc.) but it is a cubbyhole and is cozy as hell.   Yes, you'll spend ninety-eleven dollars on cocktails that aren't really that special. But it's a fun stop.  It's *not* a good place to meet people, but if you are already with the people you're drinking with, fun.  Note that they have a limited capacity so if you arrive later in the evening you may have to wait. Just pretend the Revenooers could bust in at any time and the wait will go faster.",

Great cocktails - I had the Sidecar, listed as one of the popular drinks from the prohibition.  Very good service, nuts are placed at table as you are treated- nice touch. We loved the place but wanted food so, only stayed for one drink. The scotch was great (according to my husband.)",

Order something that someone invented long ago during a time of mixological taboos.  Glance around the room at the other patrons just sipping the hours away, until the world calls them back.  The energy here is self reflective and calming, which only adds to its value.  I shall return",

I'm looking forward to coming to town to make a stop here again and hope she is working when I do stop by.  If your on the fence go...I really liked it!",

We came here in a pretty large group this past Saturday to celebrate a friends birthday. The place is definitely small but that was nice for our group. Because of how small it is it doesn't get overly crowded like most bars where you stand on top of people. They only let so many people in so you are guaranteed to have space to breath.  The drink options were amazing as well. I only had the chance to try the Old Fashioned but I saw many of the drinks my friends ordered and they all looked delicious.",

The Old Fashioned was overpriced, cheap bourbon poured over too much hotel ice with a chunk of orange.  No finesse - get a double of bourbon instead to save a few bucks.  The Sidecar tasted like a Flavor Ice popsicle before it's put in the freezer.  It's really sad that the resident Starbucks is the best place to get a drink in this beautiful hotel.",

The hotel is epic, historic and gorgeously decorated......then down to the basement level where you will find Speakeasy.   Unfortunately, the decor in the space is very modernized, no one was dressed up, and the $20 cocktails were put together carelessly.   No one should be serving an Old Fashioned with 1/4 of a section of orange (pith included) jammed into a rocks glass with hotel ice machine chips...murky, ugly...served on a dirty glass topped table.   I could go on and on about the other cocktails we tried however, they were all just \"ok\" or were actually hideous to look at - the antithesis of a good cocktail IMHO.   Overpriced, no class, unfriendly / aloof staff, slightly dirty (as in not cleaned well) and 1995 style prohibition decor (not cool). We will not return to speakeasy, the lobby of the hotel is a much more romantic and beautiful place to enjoy a cocktail.",

With top of the line drinks, good service, and nice decor. Our server gave excellent recommendations. After a long week of whiskey and red meat, my stomach needed something more refreshing. I got some dark and stormies.  Our drinks were accompanied with some snacks. Perfect to munch on seeing how I wasn't planning on eating much that evening. The two seats were perfect for two people people wrapping up nice vacation.   My only knock was the service was a drop slow. I understand fine cocktails like these take awhile to make, but that wasn't the issue. I felt there were times we weren't checked on for awhile. After we were ready to go, it took awhile for them to even walk around for us to let them know we were ready. Still, and excellent time.",
