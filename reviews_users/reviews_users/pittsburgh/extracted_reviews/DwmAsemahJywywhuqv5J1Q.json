The shrimp noodle was yum and so were the crispy chicken. The spice level was on a higher side, but manageable. However it was really difficult communicating with the server, since he spoke very little English. Though he was trying his best to explain the details of the items. The cost was also very student friendly. So, overall, a big thumbs up!",

The knocks are the ambiance (the location used to be an Indian restaurant and they didn't change a ton) and the service (which is slower and a little more disorganized than the original), but the recipes are the same and the food is great.  I'm a big fan of the Chengdu style chicken and the double cooked sliced pork belly, but if you really can't handle spice, try the \"Chicken with Basil\" (an authentic but non-Sichuan dish with a bit of sweetness, garlic and, you guessed it, basil).  I've gone here for lunch meetings, social dinners, and take-out, and would (nay, will) happily return.",

We had a great experience at Sichuan Gourmet, which my son chose after hearing great things about it. The menu is filled with authentic Chinese dishes but for the less adventurous people they have an Americanized menu with things like orange chicken, General Tso, fried rice etc. - both the authentic Chinese food and American Chinese food menus are quite extensive. All of the food was delicious! What made the experience outstanding was our server, She Zhao. She is so patient and helpful and kind  and didn't make us feel ashamed to order off of the American menu. She refilled our waters and checked on us regularly. She helped redirect my husband when he was trying to order something more adventurous, and talked him through many options. She made the evening twice as wonderful as it already would have been. Bonus! You get sticks of gum with your bill!",

She ordered the kung pao shrimp, but mentioned that it wasn't very spicy at all, which was a disappointment.  I ordered the sliced pork with fried rice cakes because I had no idea what fried rice cakes were.  The dish was definitely one of the most unique items I've ever had.  For anybody like myself who is unfamiliar with the rice cakes and the dish, I will let you know.  The fried rice cakes were pretty much what they sounded like - cakes of rice, that had been lightly fried on the outside to hold them together and make them crispy.  The pork came in a sauce that had a viscosity somewhere between a broth and your typical Chinese corn-starch thickened sauce.  This was then poured over the rice cakes.  I was impressed that the rice cakes stayed together even after soaking in the sauce with the pork.  They took on a glutinous texture, which I enjoyed.   I think I made it about halfway through my meal before I was so full I could not continue, so I got the remainder to take home for lunch later.   The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are good.   The service was also good, we were seated promptly, followed immediately by our drink orders being taken.  The waitress was attentive and aware not to interrupt while we were obviously in the middle of a conversation.  It was very appreciated.",

Sichuan Gourmet has two locations and while I love both, I think I like the Oakland location a tiny bit more, mostly for the modern decor and the quick service. I've never had to wait for a table at the Oakland location. However, the menu at the Squirrel Hill location is much more extensive and the dining room is much larger. I truly love both locations. At the Oakland location, my all-time favorite go-to dish is the Dan Dan Noodles. These are perfectly spicy, tangy, sweet and nutty. I've also tried the seafood tofu soup (listed as one of their \"most wanted\" dishes) and I found it to be very comforting on a cold day. Unlike many of their other dishes, this soup is not spicy. Their pork dumplings are great too, and I've also tried their spicy beef noodle soup. Being Vietnamese and a lover of pho, I have high standards for beef noodle soups. Their beef noodle soup did not disappoint, although I felt it could use a better balance of flavors. The beef noodle soup is salty and spicy, lacking sweet and tangy flavors that I like from the Dan Dan noodles. Lastly, their steamed pork bun (listed under desserts) was to our surprise, correctly labeled as a dessert. It was a very nice savory-sweet ending to our meal. I have not had anything I didn't like at Sichuan Gourmet.",

It's nice to see that the establishment has opened another restaurant on Atwood, seeing as there is quite a high density of people living in South Oakland so I guess they wanted to capitalize on that. In general, food here is solid ... some of the fried stuff can be oily at times, but I'll definitely take eating here versus eating at some of the other Chinese places nearby campus (I'm looking at you, Lulu's and OE). When we came, it was actually pretty quiet, which was really quite nice. Not sure how this place at others times of the day is though. Can be a bit of a walk for those who live on campus, but certainly worth coming here as I enjoyed this place as much as the other location as well.",

    "text": "After getting into Pittsburgh on Sunday night around 7pm, I was looking for a Chinese place to deliver downtown. Surprise surprise a lot of 4 star Chinese places don't deliver, not on a Sunday night anyway. I was lucky to come across this place. I ordered a shrimp fried rice, and since it's Sichuan food, I had to get cumin lamb. I judge a lot Sichuan places by the quality of their cumin lamb.   Once I received the food, I knew I'd gotten a bit more than one person can eat. There was one bowl full of shrimp fried rice that was enough for two meals, and then there was the cumin lamb that came with a separate container of regular steamed rice. The shrimp fried rice was OK. I probably shouldn't have eaten it together with the cumin lamb.   I loved the amount of lamb in the cumin lamb. A lot of Sichuan places give you a plate with about half dried peppers and half lamb, but not in this case. There was actually about 90% lamb vs peppers. Plus, under the doughcrust there is actually a good amount of lamb, instead of just fried dough. It was very strong in a sweet and sour kind of way, with the cumin added in. Also quite spicy in that numbing way Sichuan food has. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, because the cumin lamb was so strong, the shrimp fried rice was bland in comparison. It had a bit of salty and fried rice taste to it, but the shrimp didn't really have a shrimp taste.   Great takeout Chinese place if you're in Downtown Pittsburgh on business or something, and it's pretty reasonably priced. I got the two dishes for about $33 bucks and it lasted me three meals.",

I ordered from here a few times, and each time has been quite a disappointment. In previous times, food tasted bland (quick fried cabbage with peppers, eggplant with garlic, spicy fish fillet with tofu).  This time, food was bland AND took forever to come. My order took 80 minutes from the time the order was placed to the time I received it in hand. The quick fried cabbage ($10)  I ordered was mushy... the texture is supposed to be slightly crispy. The tofu+vegetable soup I ordered was $10, but it literally served less than two portions. What a ripoff, especially considering it was rather bland as well.  So... $25 for two entrees after tip & delivery... for bland food with semi-small portions... after waiting for 80 minutes... I don't think that's worth it.",

    "text": "This is probably still one of the best places to get Sichuanese food in Oakland, and while the quality does vary a bit from time to time, they are way up there in terms of authenticity and taste. Here I want to point out the recent Shaanxi offerings, as they have hired a new chef who specializes in western Chinese food. So you might see some new items tacked on to their regular menu (though all in Chinese last I checked). As far as I know this is one of the only places in Pittsburgh that offers Shaanxi cuisine, not to mention so discreetly in a Sichuan restaurant. So far we've tried the burger (), cold skin noodles (), hot oil noodles (), and minced noodles (). (Btw all these English translations are by no means official, and you'll probably do better communicating in Chinese or via pictures.)  The first two were very comparable to what I've had at Xi'an Famous Foods in NYC. The burger is stuffed to the brim with meat, which is deliciously seasoned and very tender. The cold skin noodles come in a smaller plate than the latter two but is overflowing with flavor, particularly spicy and vinegary. It also has a bunch of different textures from the spongy noodle to the cucumber and bean sprouts. The hot oil noodles feel a bit similar, but both the noodles and the preparation are quite different. Here the noodles are a lot thicker and more chewy, and the toppings include a lot of chopped up scallion and chili, but the main thing is of course the hot oil at the bottom whose flavor is absorbed by the noodles. Finally, the minced noodles is a whole different thing entirely, as it is soup based and much less spicy; the noodles used are the usual stringy kind, and the bowl is filled with the signature chopped up veggies, garnishes, and minced meat. The broth provides the flavor, and the toppings provide the texture!",

Got the sliced pork appetizer, sweet and sour cabbage, and crispy spicy chicken. (We had originally wanted sauteed water spinach instead of the cabbage, but it wasn't available.) Portions were fairly large. The sliced pork isn't as spicy as it might seem and the crispy chicken is definitely as spicy as it looks, but both were great. I wasn't a fan of the sweet and sour cabbage though; I thought it was too...sweet and sour? It tasted a little weird to me. At one point I got attacked by an extra spicy pepper (not sure from which dish, unfortunately, so I could not warn my friend). Water and rice did not help. My mouth was on fire and some tears rolled down my face. I totally made eye contact with one of the chefs who had just sat down a few tables away as I was sucking air into my mouth to cool it down. I'm sure he tried to hide a smile. He knew what he did.   The ceiling lights down the center of the dining area looked like tree branches and all the furniture was wooden, so it kinda felt like we were in a giant tree house. Not gonna lie, in terms of interior, Sichuan Gourmet really stands out from other restaurants on Atwood.  I'd definitely prefer this location to the one in Squirrel Hill. The flavors are stronger and the interior is way cooler.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4  Presentation | 3  Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5",

I gotten a confirmed time of 45 minutes the first time, and the delivery coming a little after 1:15 hrs later (no mention, no apology). The second time, the food came in the 45-60 minute window, but it all arrived cold except the rice, which sucks because the chicken got soggy.

You'll be sweating and your whole mouth will be numb. Also, a warning for those who don't like garlic either because everything is super heavy on garlic as well. It's a great value because everything comes in huge, family size portions (great for groups!) I highly recommend the pork belly appetizer! As for entrees, I normally get the fish filet with tofu, it comes as a hot bowl simmering over a fire. It is definitely spicy! I like the string beans and eggplant dishes too. For dessert, they have mantou (like Chinese steamed bread buns) which makes me so nostalgic, and it comes steamed and fried. It's definitely an experience coming here! Parking is pretty tough around here though, it's right in the heart of South Oakland.",

    "text": "Our weeknight dinner here was a mixed experience.  We were treated to very closely attended service on a slow Thursday night, as we ordered the FISH FILLET WITH PICKLED SOUR VEG SOUP, CHENGDU SLICED PORK BELLY, and PAN FRIED HOT PEPPERS.  After our first two dishes came out, we were informed that the kitchen was out of peppers, and we selected the CHINESE EGGPLANT IN GARLIC SAUCE instead.  We complemented our meals with hot tea and a Blue Moon.  The hot soup was super comforting on a single degree-temperature night--not too sour and full of sliced tilapia fillets.  We dug into the huge bowl but still managed to take about 1/3 of it home with us.  However, I wish it had been spicy as the menu indicated (and as the server \"warned\" us about).  Too bad.  The pork belly was thinly sliced beautifully and stir fried with leeks.  I'm not sure how this dish differs from the DOUBLE COOKED PORK BELLY we've ordered in the past, as it looked and tasted exactly the same, but it was satisfying nonetheless.  The second-choice eggplant, however, was a huge disappointment.  It appeared wonderfully saucy and flavorful, but past the outside coating, the inside of each piece was completely bland.  Perhaps it had been flash fried too quickly for any flavor to soak in, as the dish came out about 3 minutes after we ordered it.  My SO and I both nibbled at a piece before completely giving up on the dish.  We asked the waitress not to box it up, stating that we didn't enjoy it, but sadly they charged us for it anyway.  That's fine, I suppose, I've learned not to expect great service from a Chinese restaurant.  Sigh, overall, my meal was enjoyable, mainly because it's hard for me to eat Chinese food and NOT enjoy it.  Nothing that happened tonight was a dealbreaker--just a lot of tiny irksome things that brought Sichuan Gourmet a notch lower in my mind.  I guess when you're one of the few \"authentic\" restaurants in this Sichuan wasteland, there is sadly little incentive to raise the bar.",

The best part of my meal was the check with 2 sticks of gum included, which we only received after my girlfriend shouted to the group of waitresses wrapping birthday gifts behind the counter.  Next, the service was mediocre at best.  Our waitress never once checked in to see how our meal was or if it could be improved in any way.  Also, a simple substitution of fried rice for white rice seemed to be impossible.    As for the food the chicken ordered was chewey, spongey, and somehow stringy.    Yes they were clean as in mopping the floors with what I would guess to be 90% bleach.  While they were mopping my nose hairs would burn with every breath.    Overall, never eating here again.  The nine dollar buffet up the street is way more appetizing.",

The tendon was spicy and had s ton of flavor. My favorite dish were the veggies! I love garlic and this dish just had lots of it. On the other hand, I was extremely disappointed in the sweet and sour spare ribs. It was seriously not what I thought it would be. The meat was overlooked and I hated the flavor. We quickly dined and left as I was uncomfortable with the environment and did not like the taste of the water.

The menu is enormous but 75% of the items are not your typical sweet and sour or cashew chicken on most Chineese restaurants or even those that have Szechuan in their name. So I'm getting pretty excited.  I've had the best Szechuan food in Paris and was told it was authentic. I've been trying to recreate that experience again in the States with lots of disappointment.   The food is amazing. Not as spicy as I could handle but plenty spicy for my wife and daughter. I was not at all disappointed. The flavor is so much more pronounced than I'm accustom from even the nicest Chineese restaurants I frequent in the DC area.  I will literally come back to Pittsburgh for this Resturant and bring friends to enjoy the Szechuan delights. The portions are huge and ten people could easily eat for under $100 if they chose. We had plenty of take away for our trip back to Virginia.   Thank you Pittsburgh. Thank you Yelp. And Thank you Szechuan Gourmet Resturant",

Interior is also comfortable, with CPop playing quietly and a decent amount of seating. 3/4 of tables were taken at about 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  However, the low rating is due to the food. We ordered Mala beef tendon, which despite the nice thin slices, was far too slight on any mala flavor and overly salty. The sauteed green beans were also way too salty and though soft on the inside, did not have the blackened thin crisp desired on the skin. The last dish garners lowest marks - my typical favorite cumin lamb. The chunks were either too large and connected or too small, and they came out as though half deep-fried with puffy crisp. The flavor was incredibly sweet, causing great confusion, and there was hardly a cumin tinge whatsoever.  I'll have to try Sichuan Gourmet again, but the first impression didn't make the grade for me.",

Perhaps should have tried something with Sichuan peppercorns, but didn't. Good meal, good service, no complaints.",

The atmosphere is authentic the special board is all in !   The decorations are lacking but what they lack in design they make up for in flavor!  If you are able to read Chinese ask for the Chinese menu as it is different.  There are tvs but I have never seen one turned on so maybe not the best place to catch the game even though they have a bar area.",

    "text": "Wow was I disappointed in this place after reading the other reviews. Maybe my mistake was ordering takeout?  I'll start with the good: the spicy cumin lamb ($16.99) . It was actually spicy and cumin-y and delivered as promised. The food came in a third of the time promised (estimate was 90 minutes and it came in 30) . ... OK, that's it.  The Ok: The house special fried rice ($10.99)  - I forget what it's called get it has shrimp and chicken and maybe beef - was pretty boring tbh. But passable.  The not-great: My order was messed up and for $60 worth of food, I would expect a little more. Example, two Coke cans instead of Diet Coke and a driver who said he was too busy to go back for it or come back with it later. No extra sauces as requested either.  The pretty bad: everything else. The dumplings ($6.99)  had hardly any filling and the filling that was there wasn't that tasty. The scallion pancakes ($4.99) were greasy, there were hardly any of them and I'd need a magnifying glass to find any scallions. The sweet and sour cabbage lunch special ($6.99) was a cup of slimy, pale cabbage and a heap of white rice.  I'm sooooo sad because I'm only in the area a couple days and I love good Sichuan and I was craving something good. Disappointing. Sigh.",

I always start with at least one order of shrimp dumplings (har gao), followed closely by either Dan Dan noodles or hot and spicy bamboo shoots. What comes next is always a toss up, because I've honestly never had anything bad here! I have tried the shrimp hot pot, the crispy chicken with pepper, tea smoked duck...all are amazing. I inevitably find myself scanning the room to see what other people are ordering around the restaurant to give myself ideas for next time. It's a unique and wonderful problem to have that there are so many delicious things on the menu. My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep, but let's be clear, there's not anything I've found this good anywhere else in Pittsburgh...yet! Make sure you mention any allergies or dislike of spice to your server - they are very, very helpful. Many of the dishes are wonderfully, steamily spicy, so get ready to drink a lot of water with your meal!",

The fish was addictively spicy and salty. It was a little oily and didn't come with much broth (probably because it was takeout), but it went so well with the rice.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Sichuan Gourmet for some time.  I finally broke down one day and ordered from there off Yelp! I ordered Dumplings with Red Oil and Dan Dan Noodles.  My ordering experience through Yelp! was extremely easy,...so easy that I am afraid that I might start ordering my lunches through all of the places I discover on Yelp! and need a second mortgage to cover all my extravagant eating.   My delivery driver through Door Dash called me right in the time window I was given and told me that he was there.  I went to the lobby of my building and he was not.  I called him and he said he was a couple minutes away.  After waiting 10 minutes I called again.  He had gone to the wrong address, mistakenly going to an AVENUE when my location was a STREET.  He told me he needed 15 more minutes.  I was definitely not happy with this.  I waited and he arrived about 15 minutes later.  Very apologetic, though I had to go outside to his car to get the food instead of him coming into my building.  Don't know if this is normal for Door Dash or deliveries in the city.  When I got to my desk and opened my bag my noodles were there, but instead of Dumplings with Red Oil I got Cucumbers in Red Oil.  I was not happy.  I called the restaurant as Door Dash informs you to do for deliveries.  I explained the mix up and asked they send the correct item.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fast they were there with the Dumplings.  I think that this delivery guy was actually a restaurant employee instead of a Door Dash driver.  Ok,...finally,...to the food.  The Dan Dan Noodles were pretty good.  I liked them fine and they were nice and chewy.  The dumplings, once I finally got them, were Great! Very tasty and filling.  They are a little hard to wrangle with chopsticks, but I could eat a meal of nothing but those! Delicious. I will say that though both items were described as \"Spicy\", neither really brought any heat.  Wouldn't mind a little heat with either of them.  I do hope to get to the restaurant still and hope to have a little bit better experience dining in then I got from delivery.  I understand that the Door Dash wait is not the restaurants fault as that was on the driver, but I would have rather had a 30 minute wait for a late driver and all my food rather then a 30 minute wait for a late driver and only half my food,...and then have to go back down for the other half later.",

My beef and broccoli was delicious as well. I ordered via GrubHub via the Yelp app and my order was ready when I arrived.  The dining room is kind of cute and unexpected in South Oakland which makes it all the more charming. Oakland itself lacks in many food places that are dine-in experiences.   I'm giving this place four stars for two reasons. The first is that the food was great for the price but the best that I've had. Secondly, I felt the cashier was slightly rude. I held my hand out to get my card back and she set it on the counter instead. It also seemed like she was in a hurry even though there weren't many people other than myself present. She seemed to warm up when she brought my second order.   I look forward to trying more on the menu and dining in one night.",

    "text": "My husband had wanted to try this place for a long time. They have a coupon in the Enjoy book and, previously, we had not taken the time to travel to Oakland or Squirrel Hill to try it out. For our four year anniversary, we changed that! The street parking was challenging as the Oakland location was so close to Pitt's campus. If you are willing to walk, there is a parking garage a few blocks away that makes parking options easier.   The moment we walked in, I knew it would be authentic Asian cuisine! I am typically a general tso's chicken or chicken fried rice type of girl, but I decided to go out of my comfort zone. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken - the sauce was delicious, the chicken was tender, and the dried peppers were spicy!! There were almost too many peppers for my liking, but it was not unbearable. My husband ordered a mango bubble tea that helped cut the spice. The tapioca 'bubbles' were weird in texture but the flavor and consistency of the tea was outstanding! The portions are very generous and can easily be made into two meals. My husband ordered a lamb dish - having no experience with lamb, I gave it a taste and really enjoyed it!   This was by far my favorite Chinese food experience. The prices are higher but the food is better, the service was excellent, and the restaurant takes you to Sichuan!",

    "text": "I passed through Pittsburgh really briefly, maybe only like 3 hours, and went to go visit a friend who was at CMU. We wanted to get something nearby, so we came here.  CMU and the greater pittsburgh area is probably similar to lots of college areas in the USA, in that there has been a great increase in the # and quality of Chinese places, as a result of the increased size of the chinese student body. Sichuan gourmet is a pretty faithful rendition of chinese culture/cuisine, both in terms of presentation and execution.  We got two dishes between three people: the spicy sour fish stew, and a spicy fried chicken. I felt like the spicy fried chicken was pretty good (how hard it is to do fried chicken though?), but wasn't terribly spicy. This is a funny feature of a lot of sichuanese places- the presentation of a dish will feature tons of chilis or chili oil, but the actual taste of the dish will be fairly mild.   The spicy sour fish on the other hand was not as soupy as I usually have it, which was certainly different. I liked the taste quite a bit, but it was a little bit too salty- they definitely could have toned this down a bit. I got these dishes with white rice, which paired fairly well.  I probably won't be in Pitt any time soon, but this was an okay restaurant, and as long as they keep their prices reasonable, I'd come back again.",

It's a shame the place is tucked away a little ways from the bustling Oakland cauldron of restaurants, but people still manage to find their way to this gem.  A defining characteristic of Sichuan spicy is the savory, numbing spicy, and this place really brings it to you. Furthermore, their dishes are very authentic, and they make their meat taste good! Everything tastes fresh, not dry, and it's just a joy to eat.  A big plus is that their American Chinese menu is just as good, so if you have friends that don't like spicy, they'll still be in good selection of other tasty options.  Service here is actually really good compared to other Chinese restaurants. They treat their Chinese and non Chinese patrons with respect, and you feel well pampered.  The wait here can get long, but it's for a good reason. Stop by to try the best Sichuan the steel city has to offer.",

And if my other friends tell me that the spicy ones were heavenly, I believe them. This place is so popular that you have to wait to get a table, but it is definitely worth it all.",

The food is close enough to the authentic dishes I enjoy every now and then when I return to China, however I find that the spicyness is a little off; I can't really explain it and all I can say is that it's not quite \"Sichuan\" spicy.  The looks and layout of the restaurant were more presentable than most other restaurants. My only qualm here was that they didn't have an actual round table for large groups. I myself came with a party of 8, and there was one large rectangular table in the back. No way of rotating dishes either so it was really hard to do the usual family style.   Looking at the menu shows that dishes are quite pricey, however once the dishes arrive you'll understand why. Portions are huge, probably serving 2-3 per plate for most dishes.   I personally enjoyed the cumin lamb a lot. It did seem like a good part of it was just fat, but the spices used were perfect. I also enjoyed the A1 appetizer, I forget the English name, but that's usually a standard dish you get at spicy Sichuan restaurants.   This place just needs to turn it up a notch with the spicy.  Overall great experience. Looking forward to satisfying my Sichuan cravings here in the future.",

I am in Flushing Queens a few times a year and I've ordered these noodles from all the Bourdain and Zimmern recommended places and they don't hold a candle to the plate of noodles I've just been eating.You can tell they're truly handmade  and their slightly chewy texture is just right! Oh I got so excited I almost forgot to say how their cumin lamb totally smokes the competition.They give you so much lamb and its texture is just right almost tender inside and crisp outside.It leaves Chengdu Gourmet ' s version in the dust.

There was much more choice for $6.99 compared to the $7.50 at the Sq hill location and the portion size for both of our dishes (fish in pickled peppers and homestyle pork) was way too good for lunch menu. Just loved it. Also, cannot complain about the service, it might not be great but it was not bad either. The server filled our glasses with water and coke and also asked us about the food.
