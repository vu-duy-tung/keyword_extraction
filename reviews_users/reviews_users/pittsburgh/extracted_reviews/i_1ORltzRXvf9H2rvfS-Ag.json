    "text": "I've driven past this place a few times while in town, and finally went in for a spur-of-the-moment bite last night.  I have pretty high standards for my middle eastern cuisine, having worked in a lebanese restaurant for six years, so i am not the easiest to please when it comes to this genre of food... but i was pleasantly surprised.    The hummis was pretty tasty-- obviously fresh and homemade, with a subtle tahini flavor and not overpowered by garlic (as it often is).  I also got fresh veggies to dip and they were crisp and delicious.  The grape leaves are awesome because they come vegetarian, and you can get 6 of them for only $3.50 (amazing!).  The only so-so item i got was the spinach pie, and i only thought this because it's too bready for me... it has layers and layers and layers of filo dough and not enough taste to the feta and spinach filling.  Oh and strangely, they do not have tabouli or falafel on the menu.  Overall, though, I will absolutely go here again.  It's so nice to have a good ethnic restaurant in this area that tends to be swallowed up by applebee's galore.  And, a bonus, if you or someone you go with are into super-American cuisine, they even cater to this crowd, offering pizzas, wings, and a variety of more common appetizers.",

Gali's also sells pizza, hoagies, spaghetti, and the like for the unadventurous, but why order Italian or American when Gali's offers one Titan of a gyro?  I ordered four of these Gegenees thinking that two wouldn't be enough to feed my tribe. I barely surpassed one. The meat is so plentiful, the soft, fresh pita bread could barely contain it all. The tzatziki sauce was sweeter than Aphrodite, and the onions, tomatoes, and lettuce tasted as if they were harvested by Demeter herself. These were Thessaloniki gyros, meaning they were mammoths.   Mom's birthday is due soon, so I ordered for her a Special Greek Platter which includes grape leaves, the best spanakopita I have ever tasted (she let me sample a corner of this phlaky phyllo phantasy pie), fried meatballs (lamb? pork? who cares? tasty!), feta cheese, tomato slices, olives, pita bread, that tzatziki cream, and a supremely smooth, nutty hummus.   She's now readjusting her will.   The Appetizer Platter has the meatballs, tzatziki sauce, and fried zucchini (cut properly into long strips), onion rings, more shaved lamb, and calamari so divine, it could have come from Pontos.  Gali's is proof that Pittsburgh's southern suburbs are not Tartarus.",

I was impressed from the moment I walked in, as this was the first time I had ever been in a sit-down Greek restaurant. Their gyro special includes French fries, soup, or salad along with your gyro and drink for 10$. I had the special, with wedding soup, and my mom had a salad. The soup was great, as was the gyro. The place got busy just after we got in, too, which shows how much business the place gets and deserves. The food, service, and atmosphere were all wonderful, and I would happily recommend this place to anyone and I hope to be back soon myself.",

After getting the food home and opening it she realized they gave her some type of salad. Salads are half the price of the platter. The receipt stated platter plus .80 for extra olives. It had 10 half pieces of french fries, 7 olives(paid .80 cents for extra olives), cucumbers (asked for without), green peppers(not on the platter), salad dressing(not on platter), stale pita wrapped in foil, and the 2 pieces of tomato were just the butt end of a tomato. She called and a so called supervisor got on the phone. The employee was totally ignorant on the phone. She told my wife that she doesn't know how to read a menu and the food we got was a platter. My wife has been in the food business for 30 years with a culinary degree. The employee did not even try to give an apology and hung up on my wife. Customer service could not be worse.",

Needles to say, it was awesome. The meat was juicy, but somewhat crispy from roasting on whatever you call that rotating gyro stick, the cucumber sauce was creamy but not overdone, and the greek salad dressing was some of the best I've ever had. Spend the extra $1.00 and add feta to that salad for a special treat (it's super fresh and an nice change from the fat free Sam's Club feta I'm use to!).  We also ordered 6 grape leaves, which were served hot and added on the homemade hummus with warm pita bread. By the time it was all said and done, the wife and I walked out for less that $30 and each had a  gyro, salad, iced teas, hummus & grape leaves. We were stuffed and I'm definitely looking forward to the next trip!  One final thought, if you hit it up early enough in the day, head next door to Pastries A La Cart & take home one of the best cakes you'll ever eat too!",

The gyro i had was a monster! There was so much Lamb in it! I couldn't even get it in my mouth! It was so good! The lamb was so tender! The pita shell was so soft and tasteful! It was just an all around great experience! The service was a 5 out of 10, but the poor lady was all by herself and the place was so busy! You can't fault her for that! I couldnt get mad.

The atmosphere definitely is not here, but the food makes up for it. At first glance, $8.99 for a gyro, fries, and drinks seems at the higher end (compared to the \"other\" gyro joints in town) but once you receive your order, you understand why.  I would go so far as to say they have the best gyro in the city.  The pita was perfect - large, soft, and well seasoned.  It was packed with well-seasoned lamb, and topped with just the right amount of tatziki.  As a gyro connoisseur, I would put this at the top of the pack in the area.  I'm wishing it wasn't 4 hours away (sarcasm, but South Hills  traffic, ugh) so I could try another one.    If you're on miserable 51, stop in for a gyro, you can't beat it.",

This part of Rt. 51 is littered with chain restaurant after chain restaurant, which makes this place seem like a breath of fresh air.  Although the atmosphere is definitely lacking, Gali's delicious food more than makes up for it.  The homemade hummus and tzatziki are both great and are served with a warm, soft pita bread.  It's my favorite tzatziki around...creamy, fresh, and just the right amount of spices.  Another appetizer that I really enjoy is the grape leaves.  They have a great texture and the rice filling is flavorful and vegetarian.  The gyros here are also excellent and can be ordered with lamb, beef, chicken, pork, or vegetables.  Plenty of meat and toppings, with just the right amount of tzatziki sauce.  I sometimes go for the Chicken Plate, which is sort of like a deconstructed gyro...it comes with grilled chicken, sliced tomato and cucumber, feta cheese, greek olives, pita, and a side of tzatziki, all arranged on a plate. Sometimes the chicken is a bit greasy, but it is nonetheless delicious.    If you find yourself in the South Hills area, this place is a must-try.  Plenty of options for vegetarians too.",

Interior - Clean tables, floors, restrooms, and simple decor. 3. Staff - Very friendly and professional Food 1. Plenty of food for a great price 2. Very good quality and delicious 3. Delivered to your table fast  Some small details that impressed me: 1. Our server brought a cold squeeze bottle of ketchup from the fridge. Not a room temp bottle left on the table, or packets guarded like they are gold. 2. My fries were perfect, straight out of the fryer, no skins, no salt(but in shakers on the table). 3. Crushed ice in the drinks, not cubes. 4. Server was very knowledgeable of the menu and provided excellent advice.",

This is one of my favorite places to go in all of Pittsburgh! I've tried hundreds of gyros from all over the world, and this by far is the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this delicious traditional Greek cuisine. They have a gyro special, for $11.29 you get a large gyro, salad or fries and soda/tea. It is a deal you can't beat.   It is great for a quick lunch or enjoyable dinner, they can accommodate your every need. You absolutely will not be disappointed.",

I went with the salad and house Greek dressing. The dressing was good and I even took a bottle home. The gyro itself was great. For me there are 3 main things I look for in a good gyro. The tzatziki must hold up to the meat and veggies. It needs to be creamy. 2nd the lettuce onion and tomato must be fresh and last but not least the meet needs to be tender and juicy. This place delivered on all front. For dessert I split the baklava. I wish I could have it for breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm looking forward to my next gyro that's for sure.",

    "text": "We pasted by this place on our way through pleasant hills. When deciding between Subway and chick-fil-a, I decided I wanted something that was more local than a national chain. We decided to eat here because of the ratings plus i never turn down a good gyro.  The interior is pretty small til i seen extra seating in the back which i assume had booths but there was a wall blocking the view of the tables. we were seated but in chairs that kinda remind you your at the mall with the thin padding and jail bar backing. The menu was pretty nice with lots of choices of authentic greek dishes. I ordered grape leaves and my sis got the bubaganush which is eggplant hummus with pita bread. The grape leaves were tangy and the rice nice and soft, i really enjoyed the flavor. As for the hummus, it was GREAT!! the flavor of olive juice in the hummus made it so delicious with the soft pita bread. It wasn't too salty or bland but just right for my taste buds.  For our meal we ordered a 2 large gyros while my niece got chicken fingers and fries. Nothing special about the chicken fingers although the were cooked to order. The Gyro was HUGE!! Lots of meat i mean LOTS like 10 slices i think. When you add all the lettuce, tomatoes, onion and sauce, the pita could barely hold all the ingredients in. :D This made for a great looking gyro. The flavor was nothing too amazing but it was pretty good. It tasted like other gyros I've had but it just had more meat on it. The gyro only cost $6.19 which isn't bad for how amazingly huge it was.   As far as being satisfied it goes way beyond that. I couldn't even finish my gyro even tho the grape leaves and hummus may be to blame for that. Regardless it was a pretty good meal and I enjoyed everything that i ate. The service was decent. The waitress informed us of how everything was house made (excluding chicken) and we even got to thank the owners who were authentic greeks. They accept credit cards which is nice too because from first glance they appear to be cash only. I would definitely recommend this place over the gyro spots in pittsburgh, the fact that they have an X-tra large gyro over the Large gyros that we ate blows my mind! You should definitely check them out!!",

I could probably end my review here, but let me elaborate further.  Darren W. is absolutely right -- eating one of these gyros is a truly Herculean effort.  I can just barely finish one, and I'm guaranteed to not be hungry for more or less the rest of the day.  And what a gyro it is!  Gigantic, toasty pita.  Wonderfully seasoned lamb, and tons of it.  Tzatziki sauce that is one part cool cucumber and two parts AMBROSIA OF THE GODS.  Crisp lettuce, juicy tomato, flavorful onion.  All wrapped up in a large foil package that contains all the wonders of modern compression technology therein, because the package itself is deceptively SMALL for what lies within.  Darren also jokingly claims that if you give the Minotaur this gyro, he'll be your friend.  I'm in absolute agreement, except for one detail.  The story usually ends with the Minotaur having the gyro for lunch, right?  At Gali's, the gyro is so huge and powerful that THE GYRO HAS THE MINOTAUR FOR LUNCH, not the other way around.  Highly, highly, recommended.  EAT GYRO OR DIE!",

I believe it exceeded our expectations and we fully intend to return.  After careful consideration (by me-it could possibly be my last meal- so be very diligent!), we started with the Special Greek Platter.  It included grape leaves, which we all enjoyed, fried meatballs (only two of us ate these - they are awesome), Spanakopita (delicious),feta, olives, tomatoes, and hummus (maybe the best I have tasted!) This is a great choice for 2-4 people to have a sample of many wonderful tastes or for one to have a very nice personal feast.  We shared two large salads, the Bifteki - greek salad (essentially) with 2 greek burgers and the Half & Half - again greek salad with gyro meat and chicken.  Our server was happy to provide an additional dish and offered more if we required them - nice touch!  Both salads were served with their greek dressing and cucumber sauce. I am a sauce and dressing person and tend to order \"extra\" - what was provided was quite sufficient for our party.  I really liked all of the meats as well as the salad itself.  For me the thinly sliced gyro meat was the star, then the chicken and lastly the greek burger.  The others in the group would have rated it differently, one with burger at the top, then chicken(she thought it a bit over cooked), then gyro meat (but she doesn't care for it at all and still said it was good) and the other gyro, burger, chicken.  Nobody was unhappy!!  The restaurant  was quite clean and comfortable for a very casual eatery.  The service was very considerate and attentive without being overbearing. The entire staff was very friendly and welcoming.  All-in-all an extremely pleasant experience!!",

    "text": "Some of the best places to dine can be right under my nose as I drive by them. Gali's is no exception to this. Stopped here after my visit the ENT for lunch. They have a small dining area. Take out is also available. They have a daily gyro special that includes a large regular gyro with a drink and your choice of soup, side salad or French fries for $12.49. They are also offering a similar choice using a fish hoagie for all Fridays during Lent and for Ash Wednesday. You cannot substitute the choice of meat in this combination but you can have items removed such as tomatoes, onion, and lettuce.  I wanted to try the chicken gyro so today I was willing to go ala carte. Today's soup was a lentil soup and being such a cold day I ordered that.  The soup was a large portion and was very good indeed. The crackers were fresh and crispy. Everything here is made fresh to order.  Next up was my chicken gyro. My waitress was very helpful in bringing me tons of extra napkins I needed to go with meal. It took me a little time to find the chicken through the shredded lettuce but they had nice chunks of it scattered throughout. Unlike the regular gyro which I noticed you can't see anything else but the tons of meat on top of it this gyro had chicken buried and made it quite tasty and very messy!   Portion sizes here are huge and even if you went with a starter or appetizer there would be more than enough satisfy as a normal meal. In fact there is a $3.00 sharing charge so as always I would advise one person order a main dish and the other order and appetizer or starter and divide your meal accordingly. Take out is also available and they do party trays. They also sell the olive oil they cook with along with Greek salad dressing.  There are a number of vegan options on the menu and if you want to go gluten free then stick with one of their salads. The menu clearly spells out everything so that you are not taken by surprise. I noticed they have a small area for what I would call private dining for meetings and such. When you are finished with your meal you pay at the register and leave your tip at the table.   Service was indeed very friendly and staff extremely helpful. Even though I went ala carte my bill did not even reach $20.00. Good food at reasonable prices-what more can you ask for? Located in a tiny strip mall on Clairton Blvd near the \"cloverleaf\" that leads to Bil Greene's shopping center they have their own parking lot.",

While I usually pickup, it is not a bad place to eat inside.  The workers are always super friendly as well.  I am not sure what makes them so good here.  It may be the thick and flavorful pita which holds everything together.  It could also be the sauce which has a great taste.  The meat is also super fresh and tender.  I would put this place in a close second to Mike & Tony's for best gyro in Pittsburgh.",

I'm Greek, but I don't have a particular love for Greek food. Except at Gali's. Everything they do they do so well. They have lots of different variety too. Their gyro plates and wraps, chicken gyros, meatball hoagies, fries with feta, honey balsamic chicken, baklava...should I go on? All sooo good. They also have a different soup each day of the week. I've had them all and they're all great. The lentil in particular is my favorite. They're such kind people here and very fast as well. I don't have enough good things I could say about them.",

Pittsburgh makes Chicago-style Gyros (arguably the best kind), shaved off the spinning rotating cylinder of ground beef-and-lamb. A lot of places use fake frozen strips of meat. Not in The Burgh and definitely not here.  Gali's is simply the best Gyro in the Burgh. There's plenty of competition, too, from the likes of Mike & Tony's, but this one is my favourite. It's consistent, it's delicious, and it always hits the spot, so to speak, in an eating sense, not in any other sense.  The Central Diner also has a very good one, but expensive, and the Istanbul Grille Gyro (and everything) is awesome, but Gali's edges it out, pricewise as well. Also, they have excellent service, both from the waitresses and the owner. Excellent.  It's out of the way in the southtowns, but it's well worth stopping by.  And if you don't believe me, let's allow LL Cool J to finish the review off:  I'm going back to Gali's, the Gyro's surprising Advising friends to go here, they're sizing it up If you wear bikinis - get a small; a large if you're tall She said... she liked... the onions.  She showed me the Burgh, gave me a pita and pulled out the tzaziki sauce Now I thought that was fast, but this Gyro was ready faster I'm lookin' for a real good meal I said, \"Close your eyes, I got a surprise,\" and I ran away with both of the Gyros  I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali I'm going back to Cali.. I don't think so I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali I'm going back to Cali.. I don't think so",
