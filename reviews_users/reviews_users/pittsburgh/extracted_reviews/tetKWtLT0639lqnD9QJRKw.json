    "text": "I'll have to give this an eh.  The taste of the food is fine.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the fried rice.  I've had much better at most other Chinese restaurants.  Other than that, the food isn't any better or worse than the hundreds of other Chinese places in the area.  One nice thing is that you can get it in a drive thru.  One thing that I did not like, and will probably be a reason I won't go back is that their pricing is screwy.  I pull up to the drive thru, and the menu board says Plate $7.70 and up.  So you pick two entrees, and a side, and you have no idea how much it's going to cost.  The menu board doesn't say.  So I order, and lo and behold, the price is now over $9.  What kind of bologna is that.  I want to know how much I'm going to spend when I order.  They could easily put add $1 or whatever under the entrees so you know how much extra you're going to be charged.    So really, I'd have to say the place is a bit more pricey than most other Chinese take outs, and a lot more than mall Chinese food.  I guess you're paying for the high priced real estate and convenience of the drive thru though.  I wouldn't say I would never go back, but I'd probably be more likely to just call the Chinese take out place by my house before I'd go back here.",

A Wednesday night, it's dinner time and they tell me and my husband that the drive thru is \"closed\" but we are more than welcome to come in. OK????? We waited 20 mins for our food. They were out of almost everything. Mind you, it was very slow; not many people there at all. My husband stood there waiting for our food to be \"made\". Enough workers in the back too. Panda EXPRESS???? Yeah right.  They also put what they did have for us in our containers so it could get cold. We went to our car and had to go back in because they forgot our crab Rangoon. My husband said they handed it to him with an attitude (of course) and said \"ohhhhhhh that's whose this was...\" UH YEAH. Someone ordered it and instead of finding the person who ordered AND PAID for it, they just let it sit there and worked around it. Also, I cannot stand workers who have attitudes. Leave it at home.  When ALL of the workers have nasty attitudes, then there's a problem!!!! Will not be back.",

I decided to opt for a few entrees to share between my husband & myself. We chose honey shrimp, General tsos & the orange chicken along with chow mein noodles & white rice as a side. All the meat was delicious. The chicken was tender & the shrimp had just the right amount of crunch. All 3 sauces were amazing. My husband enjoyed the rice (although, how can you really screw up rice?) but I did not care for the noodles in the least bit. They were dry & reminded me of cardboard, almost as if they had been sitting there all day but judging by the line I know that was not the case. My major complaint is the entrance. They have an entrance that literally plops you right in the middle if the long line & another door to get into that says pull.... with no handle to pull??? After 3 days of being open I can't believe that was not corrected or even so much as a sign that says to use the other entrance. Over all the price was great (1 \"big\" plate, 1 \"bigger\" plate, 1 chicken egg roll & 1 small drink for $19 & some change) & I would go back. Hoping they correct some of the issues with parking & customer flow.",

And a company that really could care less about its customers then this is the right place to get a meal  If you prefer a comapny that respects its customers then I would say go to any other resturaunt in Pittsburgjh.  Panda Express should be ashamed of themselves for having a business like this and treating customers with absolutely no respect what so ever.  I wish this site had negative stars so I could rate this company as they so deserve.  Safe bet stay far away from this location.  They have actually on one visit tell me white rice would take 10 minutes if I wanted to wait.  I thought this was a Chinese resturaunt",

Once inside,there was yet another very long line and somewhat understandable because they had only been opened for a few weeks.  It took 45 minutes to get our food.  We did get the food to go and I admit the bowls we had were very good and tasty.  Fast forward a few months and tonight we decided to order and pay on-line to expedite our food order and even had time option for pick up.  When we went to the designated time (with our confirmation number of order and payment) they did not have our food ready nor did they have our order.  What was the point of submitting the order on line when  we had to submit our order again and wait for our food.  We gathered our order and brought it home to be again, disappointed in the texture and flavor of the food.  The rice I ordered was extremely dry and hard with no flavor.  The beef and broccoli consisted of 3 or 4 pieces of meat, again with no flavor.  I will admit the broccoli was good.  But that was about it.  I would not recommend this place nor will I go there again.  Paying $15 for 2 meals that was flavorless and uneatable was a waste of my money.",

After thinking for a minute he said I don't know what to do this order was already picked up.  I remained calm and told him that they must have given it to someone else.

The rice wasn't good either, it tasted like it had been sitting around all day. I would like to try the teas, as the website says they are really good, but I didn't even see them listed on the menu at the drive-thru. I'm guessing they are offered for people who dine in only?

The main bowl where it was supposed to be was empty. I could order it if I waited 20 minutes. I did wait.    Well beyond the twenty minutes and after a reminder, the chicken, vegetables, and Lo Mein arrived. There was no sauce on it. After three reminders, the sauce never arrived.   After reading terrible reviews on this place, I chanced it. It took over and hour here and it wasn't that busy.   The lesson learned here is to let a local clean and authentic Chinese restaurant do the cooking with better quantities , prices, and service.",

They had me pull around the side of the building and wait until my order was done. It took 20 minutes for them to bring out my order and their reasoning was that they got a new cook and he didn't know how to make the mixed vegetables. When I got home and opened my food, I noticed that I had whole pieces of vegetables that didn't seem to be cut up or even cooked. For example, I had a very, very large piece of cabbage that turned out to be the stem of the cabbage. I also had non cooked carrots, which I do have an allergy to. Overall I was quite disappointed and my meal.",

    "text": "I've been eating Panda Express since the 90's, I grew up in California. So when I saw a Panda Express was opening up in West Mifflin I couldn't wait for them to open but since they've opened my experiences there have been nothing more than disappointing. I've been there 6 times since they opened the first 3 times the rice was hard and undercooked, the fourth time they had run out of everything I wanted to order. I ended up ordering the mushroom chicken and when I got home it looked like I got the scraps that were left in the pan, my rice was undercooked and I didn't even get a fortune cookie much less any utensils to eat my food with. The fifth time I ordered the beef and broccoli bowl with rice through the drive thru, there were zero cars parked in their parking lot the place was dead but when I got home and opened the bowl There were 3 pieces of broccoli and 1 and 1/2 pieces of beef, no joke the rest was rice.  I was starving, had driven out of my way to order just that ( I'm pregnant and was craving Panda Express specifically).  I told myself I wouldn't go back. Today I found myself there again at my daughter's  request I should've told her to pick something else but I didn't.  This is what happened, after my negative experiences I was observing the server, serve the people in front of me I noticed they got good portions of the entree but when it was my turn the server must've thought I was on a diet.  I ordered a plate but got the entree portion of the bowl.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because I love Panda Express but I just won't be returning to this location, very disappointing.",

This was my third time getting food from this location, the first two times weren't great. The food was okay but the service wasn't good. I thought I'd give them another try since they only opened a few months ago. I placed an online order and when I got there they told me that the chicken and string beans I wanted wasn't available. Okay, no problem, so I picked the broccoli beef. When I brought it back to my office for my lunch, I was disgusted! The broccoli was basically raw, barely even cooked. Some goes for the chow mien, the noodles were undercooked and the cabbage was essentially raw.   There really is no excuse for such undercooked food! I definitely won't be going back to this location.",

It's not over priced, per se but it's small portions for what you pay - $6.10 for a bowl which is three scoops of rice and one scoop of entree.   I'm a big fan of strip mall Chinese places run by Chinese families. Same price but get a full plate that is over flowing, cooked fresh and usually a lunch special comes with either an egg roll or cup of soup - a much better value, especially for a freshly prepared meal.   My advice, if you are in a super hurry and crave Chinese, Panda Express may be for you. Otherwise, hit the local mom & pop place.",

    "text": "This Panda Express location opened this weekend. It took us until today, Sunday, to give it a try. Every one and their mother made the same choice. The drive thru line wrapped around the building. Unfortunately the way the property is designed you have to pretty much wait in the drive through line to reach the parking area which is in front of the building. AT&T had parking signs all over their parking lot stating only AT&T customers and employees could park there. We ended up parking in the extension lot of McDonald's parking lot.  Once we were inside the line was all of the way back to the bathrooms. The line moved quickly and no one seemed to be upset about the wait. The kitchen was struggling hard to keep the rice filled.  Our food was meh. The Beef and Broccoli tasted like it was all broccoli and no beef. There was beef but it didn't have any flavor. The teriyaki chicken was real chicken. They literally pull out a chicken breast that has a teriyaki glaze on it and slice it before putting it on your plate. They put teriyaki sauce over it. The peppered dish was not spicy but A LOT of pepper. The other beef dish was too spicy for me but the heat eater (my hubby) said that it was spicy but no flavor. Their veggies as a side is a great idea. They look fresh and taste fresh. The Honey Shrimp was a little crispy even though it was a little sticky. There is a $1.25 up charge for the shrimp but I thought it was worth it. The crab Rangoon was ok but not something I would order again. It was mostly cream cheese.  The restaurant was clean and the employees were very kind even though they were swamped. The bathroom was clean as well. When we left the line was still all of the way to the back of the restaurant. People were definitely ready to eat here. I would go if someone wanted to but it wouldn't be my first choice for Chinese.",

The woman came back to ask me if I was okay with Chow Mein instead as a side because they stopped the kitchen at 8pm. I clarified with her that they indeed closed at 9pm which she confirmed. Wait, what??? I have lots of questions. You stop cooking an hour before you close? So if I pull up at 8:50, I'm getting food that's almost an hour old? I have more questions none of which will probably be answered, because this was my last time going to Panda Express.

Please don't crucify this place for not being authentic Chinese cuisine; it is a fast and tasty option that is affordable and hits the spot!  I will certainly be back.  Try the chicken with mushroom, the veggie mix, and the beef with broccoli.",

However, the food at Panda Express is definitely better quality than you would find in a mall. I decided to go with the big plate, where you get three entrees and one side. The portion sizes are big and the food is fresh. Fast service and friendly workers.  The cream cheese rangoons were mediocre at best. I might be a little biased because I prefer crab rangoons, but the cream cheese ones were definitely bland and lacking in flavor.   I would say that overall, I enjoyed my meal. The taste was what you would expect at a normal Chinese restaurant. Would I return? Yes. Would I go out of my way to return? Probably not.",

Much better out there. The  big thing that makes me want to not come back is food it always on the cold or luke warm side. I dont even understand how that can happen and they still be open due to food safety regulations not to mention wgo know gow many people may have gotten sick. Its also not very clean.. concession area is a mess, restrooms are a mess and the glass on the door is disgusting.

We get there and it was just like a Chipotle set-up which was fine, so much looked so good it was hard to decide what to get so we got the three portion meal.   The food was good, but there WAS NO BUBBLE TEA. It was just like a regular Americanized Asian food place. It was not too bad, but nothing special like we had hoped. We still have to travel really far into the city with terrible traffic and awful parking to get Asian food that is 4-5 stars.  I really don't have much else to say about this place to really write any more about it.   It's kinda good. That's about it.",

If you've had Panda Express when it was in your nearby mall, you'll notice that not much has changed with the food. For newbies, Panda Express is super fast Chinese food. All dishes are prepared in the back and displayed on a steam serving table for you to pick whatever you want.   I found the food here to be enjoyable and very consistent with my past experiences with Panda Express. The service, however, could use some improvement. There were a lot of workers behind the counter and the ordering process was very unorganized. Despite this, I will probably be back for the orange chicken.",
