I've never been disappointed. Solid four-star plus all the way. Delivery is fast and friendly. I like to order online to get the free delivery.  Update 9/6/13: I've ordered from Pizza Fiesta probably eight times since I posted my original review. Was disappointed once when their onion rings were overcooked, and once when their fries with cheese and bacon were overcooked, but I just added a note in subsequent online orders asking them not to overcook/bake, and the next order was fine. This place still gets two big thumbs up from me.",

The pizza was tasty and affordable, and they have a big dining area which wasn't cramped at all, even at lunchtime.  The atmosphere was a little shady (we were informed that they didn't keep napkins in the dining area because \"people kept stealing them\"), and I don't think I'd take a date here, but overall this is a solid lunchtime place if you work dahntahn and like a good slice of pizza.",

Food has varied from great to okay but usually good eats.  Placed my order on-line while on a business call.  Although I was aware of incoming calls,I did not have the ability to interrupt to accept especially given the number was not recognized.  Hour and a half later I called on the order.  I was told the driver delivered the food to the the wrong address and that the calls I was getting were from Pizza Fiesta.  I'm not sure how they screwed this up because the order was placed with the correct address.  The house lights were on with the house number clearly visible.  An effective solution would have been to leave a voicemail indicating the situation.  Based on timing I might have been able to still receive the order in a timely manner.  Although they wanted to make it right by placing another order I was beat and didn't want to wait yet again for the order.  I asked to have my card credited but was told they couldn't do that at the store and needed to contact the on-line ordering company.  It was placed directly through their website so I'm calling this a loss and will not use them again personally or for my business.  This is not the first time delivery was an issue.",

I never thought of ordering pizza downtown considering I don't live down there (and there are many pizza places closer to me), but after being introduced to it, why not?   Everything I've tried has been very good. Nothing that makes me go crazy, but well worth the price. They also have a ranch dressing that is very tasty!   What keeps me going back, however, is the prices. Everything is fairly cheap. Also, if you order and get it delievered, they have it at your house withing 30-45 minutes. It's probably the quickest pizza place I've ever ordered from! They also are open till early morning which is good for when you're hungry and don't feel like cooking at 1 a.m.   The only problem is sometimes they tend to forget things. Once they forgot my drink and another time we asked for hot garlic wings and they only gave us garlic. Not anything to really complain about, but definitely something to keep in mind.",

There's no need to force someone to enter their email address and create an account just to order a pizza.  The breadsticks were a little overcooked and the bleu cheese dressing was in packet form so if you are hoping to get a container with chunks of bleu cheese in it, prepared to be disappointed.  Pizza was average but you need to let it cool off before you try to grab a slice or the cheese is going to slide right off of it.    Ordered the family feast (large plain pie, hoagie, breadsticks, two liter soda) and with tax and tip it came to $30.00.  They do charge a $1.00 delivery fee.  After the fiasco of trying to order online and the rather strange handling of the called in order I opted to pay with cash instead of using my debit or credit card.  I might order from here again; the cheeseburger hoagie was great and you actually tasted the meat but the bread needed to be cooked more.  They did get points for putting the lettuce and tomato on the side in a container and omitted the onions just as I requested.    There's nothing spectacular about the pizza but it arrived within 45 minutes and everything was correct.",

Not that I haven't devoured even better Meat Lover's Pizzas, but this omnivore and his lady were considerably impressed with what we had delivered to us the other night (yeah, they cover Beechview!) by Downtown Pittsburgh's Pizza Fiesta.   Also had was a hulking half of a Santa Fe Chicken Hoagie. Shrouded in a toasted bun comes grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, the usual vegetables, and a \"Santa Fe sauce\" that I can only describe as a median between sugar and spice. Of course, I also had mayonnaise on the sandwich, so that may have clouded my palate a bit, but I'll say this: Subway has just gotten yet another inch of dirt shoveled onto its coffin.   For dessert were the adequate, not exactly spherical funnel cakes PF calls Sugar Balls, and while they were tasty in a naughty state fair kind of way, they could have lived up to their namesake a little more if they weren't so stingy with that powdered sugar dust.   Upon the conclusion of our meal, I came to a frightening realization: I'm running out of places to review that deliver to my neighborhood!  P.S. I don't know if PF makes their cheesecake in-house or just buys it elsewhere and resells it, but the slice I had for dessert was excellent.",

We came across the Pizza Fiesta on Penn Avenue and ended up ordering gyro platters. I was not impressed, to say the least. The fries were pretty meh, and the gyros were very cheaply & poorly made. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I discovered BFG Cafe on the same street...I would recommend getting your authentic homemade gyro there (and for only $5) instead of getting the super bland gyro at Pizza Fiesta.",

Also, you're going to want to get the ranch. The ranch here is unreal and I actually can't find anything comparable.  The pizza is truly nothing to write home about. I have had it both dine-in and for delivery, and it always seems to be a little chewy and perhaps overdone. But when you're drunk, cheap pizza is cheap pizza. The guys on the phone are nice enough, but it gets a little creepy when they call my \"sweetie\" over and over again. Like, they're foreign, but every girl is not a sweetie, and I am 100% not part of that population.  All in all, Pizza Fiesta is ok. It certainly is food when I'm drunk and I need food. (PS-no one has ever asked for my college ID when I ordered over the phone. Not to be an ass, but, Just Do It, 28-year-old dudebro.)",

The pepperoni roll was good, no complaints but nothing out-of-this-world delicious. The best thing about the white pizza was the side of ranch dressing. The pizza was soaked in grease and had a weird unnatural flavoring. The ranch made it barely palatable but my stomach hurt soon after due to the sheer volume of grease. If it's late and you're desperate, go for it.",

The hand tossed dough was amazing. The cheese and pepperoni was great. We had traditional cheese and pepperoni. I wish it was a chain so that we could order locally. Keep up the good work.

I've ordered from this place twice for my lunch break and twice they've delivered my food thirty minutes earlier than what I asked for, despite my clearly stating the time my break was. This is a problem if your lunch break is at a certain time. So I end up using valuable break minutes to go down and receive food that I have to wait another thirty minutes to eat, by which time it's lukewarm and/or soggy.  The first time, I let it go, but this time I called to register a complaint and was told that the delivery man would come back in thirty minutes (what good is that going to do?) and then was hung up on (I called her back and she denied doing it). Maybe there's a language problem (I see others have also noted this); maybe they just need to clean out their ears and actually try to to give a damn.   Needless to say, I have no interest ordering from a place that has no interest in meeting its customers needs. These people clearly have no idea what they're doing and no interest in trying to learn.  If the food were at least interesting that would be the saving grace, but it's generic, and average at best.   Avoid.",

One of the other things that I really appreciate of this place is that they deliver to a huge amount of neighborhoods circling around the downtown area.  Since I started out on writing my review for this place I have ordered at least twice from here.  Both times I was not disappointed.  Both times I was full.  My first order was one of their bread twists.  I had the pepperoni variety.  If you need a visual for this, just think of everything that you would put on a pizza, minus the sauce, stuffed inside some bread that is in the shape of a C.  Only minus the sauce on the inside, why, because you get a side of marinara on the side with some ranch (more on that later) on the side.  It was good, so good that I ate it all in one sitting.    My next order here was a salad.  With a mix of iceberg and spring mix lettuce I wasn't let down by this.  Add in some cucumbers, red onions, and tomatoes I was sold.  I had opted for some of that ranch dressing I mentioned prior.  What is so good about it?  It's homemade.  So good, definitely not store bought.  I thank you for this due to my allergies, I could actually enjoy a ranch dressing again.  You've definitely earned another repeat customer in me.  Woot Woot!  Review #700",
