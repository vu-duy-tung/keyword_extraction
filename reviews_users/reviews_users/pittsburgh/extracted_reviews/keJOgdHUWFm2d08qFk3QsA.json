We asked to speak to management who told us that that the server had given us wrong information about the special and we would have to pay the full price !! Why are we being charged for their severs error? It was clearly a problem with their staff ... When the management came out to see us he was rude and confrontational ... Then the check came and we were charged double for the desserts.. Yep it's official I will never be back here again!!",

BUT the quesadilla i had as well was delicious and i gobbled up the whole thing.  i also had a yummy mango frozen margarita. the amount of different kinds of margaritas (different tequillas, different flavors, different styles) was surprising. i also love the atmosphere. when we first walked in, my friend said how her work friends like to go there when they're having a bad day because it's so cheerful. lots of colorful mexican art all over the tables, booths, chairs, everything. the bill was also relatively reasonable. on the high side of reasonable perhaps, but wouldn't stop me from coming back.",

So our local restaurants have been seeing a lot of us. Patron's has one dish in particular that we love and split because it is sooo hardy. It's their chicken, shrimp and vegetable soup!! The soup comes with about 6 nice sized shrimp, genuine white meat chicken, chocked full of veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots. You don't know whether you should eat with a fork or spoon. The flavors are great and in the cold of this brutal winter, this is just a great meal...especially if you add a fresh Margarita to your bill of fare.",

The bartender was nice and friendly, but would sometimes disappear for long periods. The free chips and salsa are always welcomed, but sometimes fill you up before your order.

The rice and beans are great--it's often the simple foods that are the hardest to do well. They offer a choice of either refried beans or black beans, and either are good, but I prefer the whole black beans. I often order the shrimp quesadillas, they're flavorful but not too heavy. The camarones diablo is another good shrimp dish.   Another reviewer mentioned the decor is rather vibrant. I've been to quite a few restaurants in various parts of Mexico that have very similar decor (not tourist restaurants). It's not necessarily my taste, either, but it probably reflects what the owners are familiar with.   The staff are wonderful. Friendly and very welcoming. Some speak Spanish, others don't, but those who do will gladly converse in Spanish.",

Always served hot and quickly -Prices aren't the lowest, but they're far from unfair  Cons: -The TVs can be hard to see from some seats -Chips can be a bit greasy -Tables have designs on them that can make setting a glass down seem a little more treacherous than it should be  I go here all the time and I'd suggest it to anyone looking for Mexican food beyond Taco Bell and whatever Chili's decides to throw on a quesadilla.",

We had never been to Patron before but since it's within 5 minutes of my family's home, we decided to try it. Patron had great large margaritas, our server was really personable, and the decor is festive/colorful. I had the chicken enchiladas dish and while the dish was good, it wasn't the best dish I've ever had from a Mexican restaurant. The meal was very large so you definitely get a lot of food. Therefore, I think this restaurant is good if you want margaritas and an \"ok\" meal but it's not the restaurant I'd go to for the best Mexican in Pittsburgh.",

Instead of bringing the bill for our drinks, and well after an hour (!!!), they brought out the food!  -- After my husband had left. And it was the  entire bill. They didn't even comp a drink or anything. Oh - and the Choripollo had only two VERY small chicken pieces. Smaller than chicken nuggets. More like chicken knuckles. We will not go back to the Patron's in Fox Chapel. We used to be such fans. They have certainly gone down hill.",

I should have listened to the reviews, but I instead based my decision to eat at this location of Patron because I had a good experience many months ago at their location in Monroeville. We were seated promptly, and the waitress was polite. However, the appetizer of nachos and the entrees of chicken quesadilla and chicken fajita, in my Mexican-descent husband's opinion, contained \"gross\" ingredients, and I thought that the foods lacked flavor. The waitress waited a while to refill my husband's empty drink. We ate about half of the food. Because I still felt hungry, we immediately went to Eat 'n Park down the street to have our second dinner. My husband said of Patron, \"This was the worst Mexican food that I've eaten in my life.\" The food also made my husband stay up all night with bad heartburn. He has even refused to ever go to another location of Patron. I think that their chef needs to be retrained.",

The guy brings out a plate with soggy corn tortillas, chicken that looked like it came from the nearest Chinese place and so many huge chunks of (uncooked) green pepper that I had to take them all off.  I tried a couple peices of chicken and a bite of the soggy tortillas UGH nasty gross.  I was starving so I pushed the plate away and ordered a side of rice.  I got that on a dirty plate served up with what looked like mixed frozen vegetables.

The second basket we were given were crunchy and still warm, so I have no doubt that our first basket of chips were old.  My older daughter and I both ordered the chicken chimichanga.  The menu simply states that it was a fried shell, filled with your choice of beef, chicken, etc... topped with a cheese sauce.   No mention of green peppers.  Needless to say, they were absolutely filled with green peppers.  More peppers than chicken.  I've never had a chimi with peppers in it at all.   My little daughter wanted chicken nuggets and fries.  They were out of nuggets so we ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla instead.  When it came out and she took a few bites, there wasn't a piece of chicken to be found.  Add to that no refills, and forgotten ketchup packets, and it was a less than stellar experience.  We'll go elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "I've been here dozens of times. It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant by any stretch. But it's solidly average, it's close to my house, and sometimes I'm wildly lazy and don't feel like trekking far to stuff my face with copious amounts of free chips. So I keep slinking back to Patron for an adequate but not outstanding meal.  The first few times I went here, I sampled several chicken dishes that had their shredded, seasoned chicken in them (e.g., chicken flautas, chicken enchiladas). I found the texture of the shredded meat to be tough, stringy and chewy -- very off putting. So I started steering clear of anything with the shredded meat, and now I usually get their \"pollo amigo\" entree, which consists of chicken breast strips over a bed of rice topped with their cheese sauce. It's fairly tasty (the meat in this dish doesn't have any texture issues), although they could stand to be more generous with the cheese sauce. It's not overly spiced or flavorful, but it's generally decent (and that's pretty much how I would describe everything I've ever eaten here -- decent but not amazing).  Service can be hit or miss depending on what section you're in. I've always been seated right away (it's rarely busy in there), and free chips and salsa have always been delivered to our table with haste.  But beyond that, you can't always count on your server to promptly take your order, fill your drink, or check up on you with any regularity. It just really depends on the day.  Given the food quality and service, I think that they are probably priced on the high side. But like I said, when a craving for Mexican food strikes, they'll get the job done adequately.",
