    "text": "Visits: Once, for dinner.  Food: I had the smelly bean curd, the shredded beef with hot pepper, the shrimp with peas, and the seafood with bean curd in hot pot. I usually have a lot to say about food, because I love food and I love tasting things, even if they're bad. Somehow, I don't actually have much of an opinion of their food. I guess that means it was okay. Not bad. Not good. Just standard tasting, generic Chinese food. That's not necessarily a bad thing - it kinda came off as \"comfortable\", I guess. The only thing worth noting is that the food is kind of bland. The smelly bean curd wasn't actually very smelly, and there was a very chicken bouillon kind of flavor for everything, save for the shredded beef (which was just soy sauce and pepper flavored). One point off here for generically bland food.  Atmosphere: It was pretty average in this regard, too. Your standard small restaurant. Could stand to be a little cleaner. There was also some live entertainment in the form of an incredibly dramatic (and loud) outburst from some woman (a customer, I guess?) who stormed out with a kid in tow after screaming in Chinese that she never wanted to see someone again. I'm guessing that's not a regular feature, though.  Service: Average, like above.  Cost/Benefit: Honestly, for the prices they charge, they could make something that doesn't taste like what I'd make if I were lazy at home. One point off for charging around $9 for the smallest Wal-mart frozen cooked shrimp + frozen peas + boullion + corn starch. It tasted good, but really, guys?  Overall, I'd say the most impressive thing about this place is just how average it manages to be.",

    "text": "Really delicious and authentic menu, their chicken soup for two is most comforting food out there, and their napa cabbage has the perfect amount of spice.  Generally  you can be in and out in about 45 mins even if you have to wait, so it's a great spot before movie or something.  I love their bubble tea too.  My only bone to pick with them is that they don't take credit cards for bubble tea/they have a minimum.    Any place that has minimum or doesn't take cards automatically loses a star because firstly that's illegal and secondly it's a very simple service to provide your customer and not doing so hurts the overall experience for many.",

    "text": "I've been here twice for dinner so far and the first time I ordered a typical Chinese dish which I think was a lo mein but it was pretty bland and the sauce was too thick.  The second time I came I ordered from the spicy beef kim chi soup from the Chef's specialties section of the menu and it was amazing.  It came out simmering on an individual hot pot and the beef was really tasty and it was flavored perfectly.  They do have a really extensive menu, also with some interesting authentic Taiwanese options I'd like to go back and try.  I wanted to get just a simple hot tea with my meal but I was informed they didn't have a \"house tea\" and directed to the special tea section of the menu which only included bubble teas and other fancy teas for over $3 each.  Would be nice to just be able to get a simple cup of hot tea, which many asian restaurants provide included with your meal.  Service is hit or miss, perhaps depending on how busy they are.  Seating area is pretty small with tables close together.",

The complaints people make seem to be about the service and the prices - I must be lucky in that the servers I've experienced have always been good ones, and I only order stuff that's reasonably priced! The portions are huge and the stuff is really good.  I wasn't a massive fan of the bubble tea, but that's more to do with personal taste than anything else. The little chewy bubbles just felt too 'weird'. The peach flavour of the tea was pretty nice though - maybe if I was a little more open to it I would've enjoyed it but I don't think I'll be ordering bubble tea again!",

    "text": "There is a lot to say about this restaurant and many will give you mixed responses.  First off, I'll say (boldly) that this restaurant serves the best and most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. The dishes are so flavorful and well-done that your taste buds will relish in happiness. Dishes of note are the Kimchi Seafood Hotpot, Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (aka three cup chicken), and Beef Noodle Soup.  Now for some cons. The restaurant staff will try to shoo you away during peak hours, often cleaning up your food and drink without asking for your permission. While this may seem rude, I can understand because the place is really small and they want to make sure people who are waiting for a table are seated. You need to accept that this will happen during peak hours. If you don't like it, come at off-peak hours.  Some of the really good dishes are quite pricey, but it's well worth it. You're stomach and taste buds won't complain one bit.",

    "text": "I would love to give Rose Tea Cafe a better rating, and if I were rating the food alone, it would certainly be a four or five... I love the food. The homestyle tofu is great, as is the pan-fried noodles. By far, my favorite dish is the scallion pancake with egg; amazing and soft and just the way I wish I could make them at home!  But the worst part is the attitude. Why do I always feel like I'm imposing on them whenever I go in? After being seriously and shamelessly bullied into paying in cash (I understand that credit cards are expensive for businesses, especially the small ones), I try to have cash with me whenever I go now. Still, I get dirty looks from the women behind the counter, from the servers, and from the cashier.   Service is slow, which isn't a problem in its own right, but if it weren't for the fact that everyone else seems to get waited on very quickly and have speedy food preparation, I'd let it go.  I went recently with a friend of mine from out of town after raving about the food and she felt really uncomfortable, too. She said she felt like she was being stared at, she felt like the server was laughing at us (I speak some Chinese, but not enough it seems), and that he was really ungracious. I don't expect a red carpet reception, but if you could keep the xenophobic judgment off your faces until after I've paid the bill and left, that would be great.   So if you don't mind being made to feel like an intruder, the food is good. But be prepared to pay in cash, or else face the death stare (if you're even allowed to pay that way).",

I know it is common to do this in Chinese restaurants in America but no one really does it in Taiwan, or at least I have never saw anyone does this to these two dishes in Taiwan.

Curry Beef over Rice) are a great deal if you're a bubble tea fanatic like me and would like a special drink alongside your meal. In my opinion, their bubble milk tea is the best in the Pittsburgh region. However if you're looking for a richer, milkier milk tea you might like Everyday Noodle better.   The only qualms I have for Rose Tea Cafe is that on busy days the staff can get quite frazzled and act in a rushed, brash manner. However, I've had good service most of the times that I have been.

The bubble teas here are great - the tapioca is consistently good, and the flavors are great.  I would usually get a basic fruit tea here, but they have a bunch of fancy ones too.  My favorite dish here is the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken, which is chicken with basil, peppers and other spices.  I ordered it on my visit and it was just as good as before - the seasoning was great, the chicken was tender, and the portion was even larger than I remembered.  Other dishes I would recommend are the Eggplant (with basil or garlic), the House Special Stir Fried Rice Cakes, and the Beef and Chinese Watercress with Sa-Cha sauce (though that last one can be pricey).  The meal specials (on the back page) aren't bad either, and come with a decent amount of food for the price.  It was great to visit here again, and I would strongly recommend Rose Tea to anyone looking for good Taiwanese, or bubble tea.",

The place is always busy, so if you have a big party you should definitely call and make a reservation.   Food=  Scallion pancake with beef- Inside a crispy pancake roll is beef that's been marinated with some sort of sauce...maybe Hoisin? A good starter for the meal  Taiwanese sausage- If you've never had asian sausages, you should know that we like our sausages sweet, not salty. A simple dish, served with slices of garlic and very good.   Shredded pork with baby bamboo- I love bamboo, and mixed in with pork was a good side dish.   Three cup chicken- A very popular dish, and one I definitely love to order when I come here. The chicken is very tender and marinated in sauce so it's never dry. The sauce is made primarily of soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and with ginger and basil.   Stinky tofu- Although I've tried it multiple times, I'm still not a fan of stinky tofu. Surprisingly when my friends ordered it here, it wasn't as stinky as it usually is when cooked at other places. I wonder if that's a good or bad thing though haha.   Kimchi seafood hotpot- Since one of our friends doesn't eat red meat, she got the kimchi seafood hotpot. It was hot and spicy, and over some rice it was very good. It's a good alternative for those that are in the mood for some seafood or something spicy. However, I can't say it's the best kimchi seafood hotpot I've ever had.   Boba- I've had the milk tea and taro boba flavors before. I have to say, every time I get boba here I'm NEVER disappointed. It's always very fresh with just the right amount of sugar. Some boba places can pack on the sugar, and you feel wired and just gross when you get to the bottom of the cup. But Rose Tea boba is one of the best I've had since moving to the Midwest!!!",

First of all, I am Chinese and I live in LA, where there's no shortage of amazing authentic Chinese cuisine. Secondly, I brought my parents with, both very particular with their Chinese food. So needless to say, the bar was set very high.   The restaurant itself is cut and cozy. We had to wait about 15 minutes, but the staff was very friendly and kept us posted. While we were waiting we looked at the menu, and it looked promising. It's a pretty expansive menu, most items looked authentic.   We ordered: -small intestine, tofu and sour cabbage soup -eggplant with garlic sauce -napa cabbage with dried shrimp -beef noodle  I would say hands down the best dish was the eggplant. It's all in the sauce and the texture of the eggplant, both were spot on. Perfect amount of sour and sweet, i wanted to lick the plate clean afterwards.   Everything else was equally delicious, we were all very impressed.   I highly recommend this place to everyone. Don't just order a boba, try something new and different, you might surprise yourself.",

This place is loved and a quick go to when trying to pick a proper Chinese restaurant.   However, no matter how hard I try, I don't think that it's all it has been cracked up to be. Their food is okay and sometimes too salty. I think that while the dishes are authentic, it isn't done well enough for the price you pay for it. I am usually a bit disappointed after leaving this place. The place is small and cramped and you can tell that they didn't put much effort into making it be aesthetically pleasing.",

The bubble tea you will be lucky enough to encounter at this establishment is the tried-and-True BEST bubble tea in this entire damn city. The tea itself is a bit sweet, be prepared, but nothing over the top (I always go for the leechee green tea), but the real kicker is the bubbles, which are not only always cooked to perfection, but are also given to you in the appropriate quantity so that you don't run out of tea/bubbles.  The only other thing I have had at Rose Tea is the egg drop soup, which has pieces of corn and is decently delicious.  But mostly...BUBBLE TEA",

Despite the unavailability of my all time favorites (Taiwanese oyster vermicelli and omelette), the flavors of the Egg Drop Tomato and Spinach Soup, the Cucumbers Mixed in Minced Garlic, the Taiwanese Tempura, the Stinky Tofu were all spot on! The service of the waitress here was very personable and kind. She took the time to explain to me in detail why they don't serve any oyster dishes (the oysters here are just too big in size compared to the ones in Taiwan). I ordered the Chicken Leg Over Rice as well, now patiently waiting (the four dishes I initially ordered arrived super fast in 5 minutes). Since I sit by the restaurant's entrance I also noticed customers walk out of here smiling lol Great job Rose Tea Cafe!!",

Sadly the chicken dish was pretty bad when I had it on Friday. I'm hoping that it was an off day. The rice cake dish was still great!

Oh so slightly expensive for chinese food (most dishes are $10+) but a) its family style so you all share, and b) its way better food than the little shack around the corner.  However, in the past few times I've come, its been...different.  I don't know if its because it's gotten so busy, or if it's changed ownership, or whatnot, the food hasn't been as amazing as it's been before.  Frequently, we get told \"Oh that's run out.\" Um...you ran out of cucumbers at 6pm?  Really? The food hasn't been as hot, or flavorful, and I found myself more often then not disappointed at the meal.   So, it's definitely still my go-to place for chinese food in the burgh, but...it's not as amazing as it once was.",

    "text": "Love their fried chicken drumstick over rice. Best choice for a take out. But if you dine in, they have lots of decent dishes to choose from. I was there yesterday with some friends. My last visit was quite some time back and so yesterday I was shocked at how the portion of each dish we ordered had shrinked! They used to serve you much bigger portion! Times are really bad! However, there's still quality in their food. Just not the service level. The employees are not exactly making you feel welcome at all. They just want to chase you out right after you finish eating. Well I can't really blame them cos the place is quite small. I won't stay long right after I eat especially when I know there's ppl queuing for tables.   Another thing I don't like their one rice per dish thingy. We are a group of 4 adults ordering 3 dishes plus an appetizer so we will only get 3 bowls of rice and have to pay extra for one more. Who sets this stupid rule??? It really got me offended when I first learnt about it.   Yes, their 3cup chicken may be good, but now I've learnt to cook my own after I found a really good recipe from online. Will not be visiting this place often...",

What does that mean?  If you've grown up eating Chinese food from American restaurants, some of Rose Tea's more eclectic fare may take some getting used to and some of the standard dishes (you know, the Sesame Chicken, the General Tso's) may taste a bit different.  My advice?  Be adventurous.  Try something that sounds weird.  If you like it, yay!  Otherwise...uh...try something else next time.  The lunch specials (that cover the front of the menu) are an excellent deal - especially if you enjoy their egg and vegetables or order a bubble tea to go along with it - and the dishes aren't too weird.  The atmosphere of the place is also nice.  It's small and cozy, with the tables far enough apart that eating doesn't feel cramped.  It can get quite loud inside, but that just another way Rose Tea makes it feel like a little piece of Chinatown in Pittsburgh.",

There was nothing wrong w/ their food, but I think they thought it was going to be something else.   One caveat. When someone says that Rose Tea Cafe has the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh, that doesn't mean much. If you like the bubble teas made from powdered mixes, you might like it.

While it has some of the more palatable Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh so far, it was not a meal that I felt satisfied the unbearable ache I've been feeling in my stomach for good Chinese food that I've had since moving here from California.  For one thing, no authentic Taiwanese breakfast.    For another thing, ma po tofu, in my recollection, involves not only tofu but also minced pork.  We got some tofu floating in a sea of thick sauce that was... not... ma po... tofu...  Curry over rice was pretty good.  Again, I'm not saying that place is bad.  But seriously folks.  This isn't authentic Chinese food.",

My cousin got a mango bubble tea which was nice and sweet and also over ice. I liked mine so much, I got a second one to go.   The menu was a little overwhelming. If you are unfamiliar with more authentic thai food, then much of the menu will not make any sense to you. The meals are listed in one line with the name and protein of what the dish it. There is no description to what you are about to order, so it's a little bit of a gamble.   I ordered chicken over pan-fried noodles. It was very good. The sauce it was in was very tasty, the meat, veggies, and noodles were all cooked very well. Again I wish the menu gave better clues as to the contents of the dishes, and I would have ventured a little further out of the safe zone.   I would love to go again, but it would be nice to take someone who knows the food so I can get a better recommendation. If nothing else, I will fill up on bubble tea.",

The prices bordered on outrageous and although the portions were adequate, the flavor of everything we ate just seemed slightly off.  The Taiwanese Chunk Chicken was texturally pleasing but after the first few bites, it tasted like the chef had used far too much fennel or anise (maybe both).  My date ordered the seafood kimchi and although the dish came with its own flaming mini-sterno, the seafood did not taste fresh and was mixed awkwardly with  bland tofu.  The server was charming to a degree but overall, we both left dissapointed with the meal, the bubble tea, and the number at the bottom of our bill.",

If you'd ask any college dude at the time what the best thing was for the money, they'd say it's the fried chicken cutlet over rice. I had it tonight and I think they changed the batter and quality of chicken. It was awful, I stopped eating it after one bite and then spiked it in the trash like a football. What a shame, but all good things have to end I guess. I did have Italian village after that, which is a good thing that still hasn't changed.   I'm not writing a yelp post because of that, that's sort of trivial or I don't really have time to care about it. BUT when the lady there gave me her slight, it sort of hatched very presumptuous thoughts and I wanted to know if I'm wrong about them. So I ordered the cutlets and two bubble teas and for some reason it cost 30 bucks, when it used to be near 20. Anyways she started putting the bubble teas in the bag with hot food, I was like 'hey pleas don't do that can I have another bag for those? She looked at me as if I fked up somehow, like how dare me.. then she pulled out these individual bags made for the bubble tea, got one, then stacked both of them in there. I don't know what to say to that sequence of events, other than it's not worth it..  Maybe the owners switched? Or maybe since they got allot of business using delivery, they don't care about quality, as what happens with allot of Chinese places. Anyways, it's allot of stuff to write. This place sucks now. I hope my friends see this and take note.",

    "text": "Living in New York City, it's actually quite difficult to get good Taiwanese food. There are only a few select spots and and most of them are in Flushing or in New Jersey. Yikes. Rose Tea Cafe blows most of these spots out of the water. Most of the Taiwanese specialty dishes here are done very well, like the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (Three Cup Chicken) which comes out sizzling in a clay pot and with tons of garlic and basil. The shredded pork with bamboo, salt and pepper pork, and the ganbian string beans are also my go-to dishes here too. The portions are great, and I usually always end up bringing extra food home.  I'm a fan of the lunch specials as well, and at those prices ($5-7), definitely a steal. My favorite is the pork chop over rice with a hard boiled tea egg. Pretty much everything is better with that tea egg. Definitely a good value if you want a hearty, high-quality meal on a college student's budget.   The milk teas and the smoothies are always better here, definitely better than Orient Express or Lulu's Noodles, likely because the ingredients are fresher and I just feel that they have more experience making these great drinks. I never really drink bubble tea anymore, but in all the years I've been going to Rose Tea, it has never disappointed.  Service is actually pretty good here, minus the actual seating part. The host/hostess always struggles with seating people efficiently, but the actual waitstaff is always pretty friendly and attentive, something that isn't common among some Asian restaurants. Service can become a little spotty when it's super busy, but it's never been enough to ruin our experience.  Overall, Rose Tea is a place that you'll see a lot of Taiwanese students/patrons at, and I think that's a testament to their authenticity and quality. The food, drinks, and better-than-average service should keep you coming back for more.",

The bubble tea is just okay - I prefer to get it elsewhere. I've gotten lavender bubble tea before and it sort of tastes soapy.   We usually get pork & baby bamboo shoots, eggplant with garlic sauce, short ribs with black pepper, kimchi fried rice, or seafood rice cakes. I would say that their food is pretty greasy/oily and sometimes I feel like I just ate a huge tub of oil, but the flavor is always on point. For the occasional Asian meal, this place is great.",

My favorite is the passion fruit green tea. -Good service. The people are usually polite and fast (for both takeout and dine-in). -To-go orders are always right.  -Food can be really good.   The reason I want to rate Rose Tea three stars (and sometimes less): -Food is not consistent and can be disappointing. This is my main concern about Rose Tea. I usually order one of two dishes and they have delicious, inedible, and everything in between. My boyfriend has not had the same kind of experience with the dishes he typically orders, but he had tried mine and agrees that they are inconsistent.",

There was only one server there taking care of everything (host, server, & busser) & she was very attentive, polite, patient, & helpful to a newbie like me. Smoothie came quickly followed by food & all were excellent. Scallions & dumplings were crisp & delicious, & drinking lemon tapioca ice through a big straw is a very cool experience. It was a small meal & I left feeling not thoroughly satisfied but vowed to return.  A week later, I ordered 3 vegetable spring rolls, spicy short ribs w/ rice & a kiwi smoothie, & this time left with a belly about to burst. Spring rolls were fresh & hot (but not too hot) & just hit the spot. Ribs, I abandoned the chopsticks with, & ate them like I was at KFC #FingerLickinGood, & I experienced brain freeze on my Kiwi ice.   I haven't been back since but will never forget the experience.",

Still, when I enter a business that is advertised as a bubble tea bar (note the giant bubble tea on the sign), I expect to be able to sit down and leisurely enjoy my $6 to $7 purchase without being rudely asked to vacate my table.

I wish I had had more stomach space and time to try more of the food but for the little bit I had it was A-OK. Would have given the place a 4 for the drink but the food brought it down a bit.  VENUE: Typical Taiwanese cafe vibe. Very casual. Good for a quick grabbing of a beverage to quench your thirst.  FOOD/DRINK:  Ordered the PASSIONATE TEMPTATION. Delicious! It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Eventhough they make their drinks with syrup, there were passionate fruit seeds in my drink! Loved it. Maybe they use real juice for that. I'm not sure. I wasn't crazy about the tapioca boba as they weren't that sweet/flavorful. But they were chewy and were not hard so that's always nice.  My friends and I split the GREEN ONION PANCAKE. I don't know if I'm just spoiled and have had sensational Taiwanese food, but this wasn't all that great for me. I feel like this dish should be jam packed with green onions. Instead it was mostly thinly friend batter and a slightly too greasy for my liking. Maybe we just got a poorly made one but either way that kind of made me sad. The taste was okay and I appreciate that they serve it with soy saucy sauce and chili sauce.  SERVICE: Our server was very kind and friendly. He did his best to put up with our loud group of gigglers and I appreciate that.",

    "text": "As hard as good Chinese food is to find in Pittsburgh, good Taiwanese food is even harder. This is the best you can get in the area, with a variety of different ethnic dishes. While most of their Taiwanese specials are a bit on the pricey side, there is usually enough such that 2 dishes can feed 3 people (or 3 dishes for 4). Definitely recommend the more exotic dishes--three cups chicken, pork strips with bamboo shoots, braised beef, Wuxi pork ribs, and even pork intestine!  My only gripe about their specialty dishes is that they are too big and pricey. While okay for a party of 3 or more, their portions are not ideal for a party of 2 (unless at least one has a limitless stomach). It'd be nicer if they could offer smaller portions for cheaper. One dish and one appetizer is also an option, but you wouldn't get as much variety in your meal.   Avoid the Americanized dishes if you can--fried rice, fried noodles, and the like. Tried the pan fried noodles once and it was a disaster: completely overladen with sodium-rich sauce, weird combinations of vegetables (broccoli and canned baby corn, wtf?), and just way oversized portions.  Their bubble tea is okay. Probably one of the better ones in Pittsburgh, but still pretty expensive. Hop on a Megabus to NYC from time to time to get your bubble tea fix: way more variety, way cheaper, way better. Their service is also so-so, pretty much hit or miss depending on how many customers are present.",

    "text": "I ate here a few Saturday nights ago with my girlfriend for dinner.  I have been coming here for the past five years or so, more often than not for their bubble tea and have only ever eaten here once before.  The inside of the restaurant is fairly small but not overly crowded which is nice.  On one side of the restaurant is an enclosed counter where you can order food to go or watch them make the bubble tea and the rest of the restaurant is made up of tables and chairs.  For my dinner entree I decided to have something a little different than my normal selections and went with the chicken and broccoli in a black pepper sauce.  Whenever the dish came out it looked exactly as I would have expected with some broccoli and chicken in a dark brown sauce that had visible pepper in it and side of rice.  The sauce was good but not nearly as spicy as I was expecting based upon the little chili pepper that was next to it on the menu.  It paired well with the chicken and broccoli and I ended up thoroughly enjoying my meal.  I especially enjoyed that my broccoli was cooked just right and was crispy instead of being overcooked and mushy.  My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal which was the eggplant in garlic sauce.  Her eggplant was also cooked nicely and the sauce was very similar to the one that I had except instead of the pepper it seemed to have a nice garlic flavor.  Before we left I also ordered a Large Green Lemon Bubble tea which I enjoyed on the way home.  They always seem to make it perfectly with a not too sweet flavor that goes well with the citrus and ample amounts of tapioca pearls at the bottom which get you through the entire drink.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  With how good my food tasted I can see myself coming here more often and not just because I love the bubble tea.",

    "text": "This is my first time in Pittsburgh and it's pretty difficult for me to get out here. However, if my friends let me, I would eat the next few meals at this very same place. That's how good it is!   The first thing I noticed when walking in are the cute jar cups! I've wanted one for the longest time and believe me I had to really remind myself of my morals to resist the temptation to slip one into my bag...Anyways the decor is neat and the interior is clean. The only complaint I have is the cold draft that would penetrate the room each time someone opened the door. Hence, we had to eat with our jackets on.   The choices are many. At first I wanted to order taiwanese chunk chicken but I was too full to get it so I ordered from the cheaper menu. I got beef stew over rice. The beef was tender and came with many vegetables in the stew along with a side of pickled veggies. I really liked the pickled veggies. I then remembered that I hated beef stew but I ate it anyways. I think that it's a great dish for someone who likes beef stew to start with. All the dishes on the special menu come with soy browned egg. YUMMY!   Another favorite was the scallion rolled pancake with beef inside. THAT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD.   The Chow Fen had a lot of vegetables and tasted rather clean. I've definitely tasted better on the streets of China, though may not be the healthiest.   I ordered bubble tea because I've heard people rave about it. I ordered a mango black bubble tea. The tapioca was a bit small for my standards but the tea was not bad. Could have been better, but probably the best they have around PIttsburgh.   For the price, the quality, and choices given, I would come back to this place if I had more time.",

If so, I will pay another visit when I visit back to the city. If not, they lost a great customer.  My previous experiences have been generally good. You can come in with a big group of people and cram in to enjoy a few different plates while enjoying the company of some good people. The servers are quick and get you food hot. The bubble teas are fantastic. Also, warm yourself up with the spicy pork roll with the delicious sauce. Noodles are good as well and, even though you may have ordered an Americanized dish, it's fresh, hot, and generous. As for my favorite, of course, you have to go with the black pepper chicken and broccoli!  Lately, the service has gotten rude and they'll take an Asian group over yours if they speak in Chinese. Food just doesn't arrive quickly enough and it's salty. Finally, dealing with the server was a pain as she didn't want to take the extra minute to hear my order.  So, Rose Tea, please wise up. The next time that I visit Pittsburgh, I would like to visit you. Don't disappoint me again.",

    "text": "Just moved to Pittsburgh from SoCal and was in desperate need of some Boba (pearl tea, bubbles, whatever they call it here) and Rose Tea Cafe is close by so why not.  I've tried all the tea spots in Pittsburgh so far and Rose Tea Cafe is the best. The best here, I mean. Definitely not comparable to California and Taiwan. Their drinks are average and taste a little powdery, but will do for now until I move back to Boba heaven. Also, they have a lot of variety. I am able to order peach green tea, which I cannot easily find at other boba establishments here.   Service is below average. After going here about five times now, I have to agree with other reviews that they do not acknowledge you and sometimes you can catch the stink eye. This might be confusing if it's your first time there because you don't know if you should stand at the door or go all the way to the counter. I don't take it personally since I'm desperate for that boba. Just walk to the counter, wait for the ladies to stop ignoring you, order your drink, and go.They make the drinks pretty quick so that's nice. I've never dined in but the menu looks great and the place does get packed so will have to do one day.   All in all, if you're in need of a boba/pearl fix in Pittsburgh and are not too snobbish about how the tea is made, Rose Tea Cafe is for you.  ++ Nothing to do with the cafe, but street parking can become a little difficult during the day and during normal rush hours. Also, there's a small parking lot for all the establishments behind the Dunkin Donuts. Remember to pay at the parking meters.",

The waiter told me \"this is a business\" as if to suggest that boba shops and coffee shops aren't businesses if they don't serve food. The server's arrogance was truly appalling and I am shocked that the food here is good enough to compensate for the awful service. Customers should not feel embarrassed for ordering what they want off the menu. Shut it down.",

I enjoy the home style tofu, the eggplant with garlic sauce (best in the city), and the sauteed green beans the best. For an appetizer I love the scallion pancake with egg.  Service is efficient tho sometimes can be poor. We once had the poor old chinese waiter dump all our leftovers instead of bagging them. So try to communicate clearly.

Beef - Beef rolled in a Crispy scallion pancake with a sauce that tastes like Hoisin Sauce or Tian Mian Jiang. one of my favorites here.  Beef W. Chinese Water Spinach In Sa-cha Sauce - Don't get this. Tasted good but was overcharged. Paid $17 when Chinese Water Spinach costs less than $3 and the beef probably cost like $2.   San Bei Ji - decent. had lots of basil but could be more salty.  Stir Fried Smelled Bean Curd W. Basil - I love Stinky tofu so I thought this was really good. The leftovers really stunk up my mini-fridge afterwards though.  Fish w/ Black Bean Sauce - One of my favorites  Sauteed Sliced Pork W. Leeks - It's not actually leeks but the green garlic or garlic shoots. Always like this dish but probably unhealthy because the sliced pork is fatty pork.  Pork Chop Over Rice - One of the specials here I always get. The fried pork cutlet is well marinated and comes with Minced pork over rice and pickled vegetables.  Fried Chicken Cutlet Over Rice - Also one of their specials. Comes with the same things as the Pork chop over rice. The chicken is well marinated and the skin is crispy.  Curry Beef Over Rice - Japanese curry. Has a lot of onions.  Sauteed Sliced Pork W. Kim Chi - Kimchi with fatty pork. Delicious.  The bubble tea here is good if a little sweet.

    "text": "I want to give Rose Tea Cafe a 5 but the service really really stinks. I felt uncomfortable even ordering bubble teas to go because I got the stinkeye from the staff. I've been here twice now and can confirm that the elderly man who serves as the waiter is not only unfriendly, but downright rude and intimidating. A small eatery who serves bubble teas should allow their customers to order them to go and display their drink menu someone visible...like, on the wall, maybe.   No, here is what they do. You walk into the cramped (otherwise cozy) restaurant. Said grumpy waiter shoves you a menu wordlessly and you end up sitting down at a table. Then I'm handed a mason jar of water and the grumpy waiter impatiently asks what I'm ordering. I'm dazed because I just want to order a bubble tea and be on my way. I awkwardly stand up and explain that I just want to order a drink to go. He has the NERVE to appear angry at me and snatches the menus out of the way. When I go up to the counter to order, there are no menus! WTF, Rose Tea Cafe?   Now, I did go here to eat as well on another trip and that was a lot less awkward but still had the same exact horrible service. The food here is great. The prices for the specials and bubble tea is very reasonable too. The prices for the regular dishes is pretty high for such a small eatery and lack of nicer plates/silverware though. I recognized many authentic Taiwanese meals and the flavors were superb. The marinated egg is excellent. It's such a shame because I would come here quite often if it were not for that one mean, mean man! Can he just work in the back so he doesn't have to talk to customers? Yeesh! Not even a smile or acknowledgement as you enter or leave the place! My friend asked him a question about the curry chicken and he just stared at her. He is just awful.",

    "text": "Came here to try the super Taiwanesey dishes, since it seems to be Pittsburgh's longest-standing Taiwanese joint, and was not disappointed!  In the winter, I want nothing but comforting soups and stews, so the BEEF STEW NOODLE SOUP definitely hit the spot.  The super flavorful, rich broth was satisfyingly beefy without being greasy, and the noodles were, as the Taiwanese would say very \"Q\"--that is, wonderfully al dente and chewy.  We asked--the noodles aren't made in house, but purchased fresh from a carefully selected vendor.  The water spinach in the soup was a nice touch, as was the pickled mustard--if I had a least favorite component, it was the beef.  Although perfectly tender, it had given up the majority of its flavor to the soup.  It would be great if Rose Tea would offer other versions of this Taiwanese staple, with tendon or offal...maybe someday, Pittsburgh.  Either way though, the dish was lovely, and my Los Angeles-derived friend of Cantonese heritage (2 distinct meccas of Taiwanese cuisine) approved as well. BNS Score: 3.5/5  The other regional staple we sampled, the TAIWANESE CHUNK CHICKEN, or 3 Cup Chicken, was satisfying as well--super flavorful and not overpowered by the basil, though the chicken was diced a bit small for my discriminating eye.  My SO went with the SHREDDED BEEF WITH CHINESE HOT PEPPER--a nice home style flavor that reminded me of my dad's Tu Dou Si (stir-fried shredded potatoes with hot peppers, a Chinese staple).  Not crazy exciting though, I'll steer him towards something else next time, as he found himself lusting after my soup. ;)  While our party of 5 had our taste buds delighted by the meal, the service was much to be desired.  Our lacto-vegetarian Indian friend ordered the KIMCHI FRIED RICE veg-style to serve his culinary restrictions but forgot to mention he does not eat egg.  When the dish came and we sent it back, the owner harshly berated him, saying it was his fault he hadn't mentioned it and that he should have spoken up earlier.  ...While this might have been technically correct, I'll let you be the judge of whether it was kosher of her to yell, over a dish that likely costs cents to make in an empty restaurant, at a customer who doesn't frequent Chinese eateries and wouldn't know any better that a standard fried rice dish basically always includes egg.  They remade his dish, but while our jovial group didn't let the experience ruin our meal, I can't say this didn't ding my perception of this experience, which otherwise would have been wholly positive.  It is my hope that someday, Chinese restaurants can transcend the often very apt stereotype of delicious food but terrible service.",

    "text": "I visited Pittsburgh for the weekend and strangely had a craving for beef noodle soup. I guess it really shows that I can't go without soup and noodles for more than a few days. My buddy told me about Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill and so I checked it out.  It was my mid-afternoon snack, so I stuck with the beef noodle soup and a jasmine bubble tea. Both were surprisingly good. Being from Toronto, I am spoiled with high-quality Chinese food. Compared to my favorite Toronto restaurants, the dish was just average. However compared to where I am situated now, in Rochester, it was good.  $8.50 gets you a generous portion of soup and noodles. While other reviewers found the beef portions to be small, I thought otherwise (see attached pictures). There were 5-6 generously sized pieces. They were well-tenderized, but still slightly chewy.   The broth was flavorful without being overly salty. However, it lacked spice and I was eager to get my hands on some hot sauce. I also thought the soup could be a bit more \"beefy\".  The noodles were al dente and cooked well. It was served with suan cai (Chinese sauerkraut) and Chinese Kai-lan vegetables. The one vegetable that I missed from dish was Chinese Bok Cho.   The bubble tea was good. The tapioca was not excessively chewy or hard. The ambiance and service were pretty average. If this place were in Toronto, I would give it a 3/5. But compared to Rochester, NY and most likely other places in Pittsburgh, I will give it a 4/5.",

The rest of what I ordered was largely unimpressive. The pork rice noodle soup was bland, the seafood chow fun (that cost $8.95) had 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 mussels, 2 tiny fake scallop disks (I think? Definitely not a real fish product, whatever it was, and definitely not tasty) and about 4 or 5 pieces of unidentifiable faux-fish spirals that squeak when you bite into them (definitely not imitation krab, which I actually love). The chow fun was also very bland, not much flavor to be found in any of the items that were ordered besides the smoothie and egg roll. The smelling crispy tofu was very smelly, and very soggy. No complaints about the egg roll, it was your run of the mill egg roll, but everything else was very disappointing. The smoothie actually tasted really good, just disappointing that for $5.45, there was no tapioca. The last time I ordered from here, I also recall being thoroughly unimpressed but was craving a drink with tapioca so figured I'd try again, and that will be the last time I choose convenience of delivery vs this places uninspired, untasty, expensive (for what it is) food.",

We also ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork, which came with white rice, and was also a decent sized meal.  Both were delicious.  For me, this is the best Asian cuisine I've had in Pittsburgh.

I had a milk black tea with boba, the milk tea was pretty good, though a bit too sweet. The boba was a great consistency, soft, chewy, and just right. (They use the smaller medium sized boba here.)  The braised intestines in a spicy sauce were good. I loved the texture of the intestines, the big pieces, and there were plenty of them. The sauce was okay enough, not great, but there were plenty of ingredients - pickled mustard greens chopped up, soft tofu etc.  The stinky tofu was mildly stinky, and a good deep fried texture. The picked vegetables it came with could use some work, as could the sauce under the tofu, otherwise the tofu was too dry by itself.  It's good to see other Asians in here eating too.  I would come back here to try the extensive menu if I was in Pittsburgh - alot of Chinese dishes on the menu (some Taiwanese dishes) and choices of teas, milk teas, and cold drinks.  Try it!",

    "text": "I love this place. At first, I would have to agree that the waitress is, not really rude, but...I think there is just a culture gap. There are things on the menu that are very authentic, that most General Tso chowing American's would probably turn their nose up at. When a Sicilian-Welsh white girl walks in and orders salt and pepper shrimp, they lean close and whisper, \"you know they are whole right? Still have eyes?\" Yes. I know. It's cool.  I think we get a little spoiled, and forget that different cultures are just that: different. That doesn't make them rude. That's all I'm going to say. Take that as you like it. I've never been treated badly here, but it is different. It took the waitress awhile to warm up to me, but she now greets me with a smile, and even makes small talk.   The food is great. The shredded beef with chinese hot pepper will ruin your life but it is soooooo delicious. The salt and pepper anything is great. Think sea salt and cracked pepper potato chip. I've had the shrimp, squid, and fish this way and it's all good. Ask for a few lemon wedges, it cuts through the salty taste (it IS called sea salt and pepper...whatever...it's supposed to be salty. Very salty.) And, speaking of squid, they nail it. It is always perfectly tender and never overcooked. The squid with basil is amazing. The seafood noodle soup is another favorite of mine. The lunch specials, which I believe are served until 3pm, (maybe 2pm?) are generous and delicious. I don't know what the marinated egg is marinated in but it was served hot, and it was killer. The fried pork cutlet is delicious too, and 2 of them with a marinated egg and side of veggies for 6.95 is a fantastic deal.   And the bubble tea? Forget going anywhere else. Best boba in the city to be sure.   Check it out with an open mind and remember it's a very small place. Take it for what it's worth. You come in to eat, not to hang out. Get in and get out. There isn't exactly ambiance ya' know? And don't go too far off the map food-wise if you aren't familiar with the more authentic dishes or if you aren't an adventurous eater. Just because you got brave and didn't like what you tried doesn't make it bad food.",

No, it's not the best I've had in the U.S. (it cannot be compared to even the most average place in San Gabriel Valley (of LA)), and yes, it's a bit over-priced (for Pittsburgh), but when you're in the mood for some Taiwanese sausages or taro cakes or cuttlefish balls or \"three cups chicken,\" they're the only game in town.  Personally, I enjoy the ambiance (crowds of Asian college students having a good time over bubble teas while the radio blares out J-pop tunes) though I imagine it's not for everyone.  [*] Re: authenticity -- by this I simply mean that they serve dishes that resemble some dishes known to people from Taiwan, and that their focus is not American-Chinese food. An earlier reviewer didn't find Rose Tea authentic enough because they don't serve Taiwanese styled breakfast and because their rendition of ma-po tofu doesn't match her recollection of the canon. I think that is too stringent a requirement for a mom-and-pop shop in Pittsburgh. Moreover, authenticity should not be confused with quality. There are plenty of terrible restaurants in Taiwan that are, by definition, authentic. There are also restaurants that serve delicious dishes that are unapologetically Americanized.",

They all told me (a Chinese-Vietnamese person) that 'chow mein' means 'stir fried vegetables'.  Correct me if I'm wrong (and I know I'm not), but chow mein is usually stir-fried egg noodles with meat and veggies.  I think they try to cheat people here because there aren't that many Asians.  But I'm pretty sure that most non-Asians know the same thing.  Even if that is what it meant, all I got everytime was a plate of stir-fried onions with a scrap here and there of a veggie.  I almost gave up hope....  Then someone told me about Rose Tea Cafe.  Finally....a menu that didn't have the same ole sh*t that every other Chinese AMERICAN menu offered.  I was so excited, I ordered 4 dishes on my first trip.  I know...kinda crazy.  But I was not disappointed.  I especially enjoyed the house special stir-fried noodles.  I finally got my noodles. :)  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I have had better and more authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food before.

    "text": "Note that this place is mis-categorized--it is a full-fledged restaurant.  While they do serve bubble tea (excellent bubble tea at that), they also have a full menu.  So for the food...Rose Tea does not serve Americanized Chinese food.  There is no General Tso's or any other foe Chinese dishes.  This is Taiwanese, home style.  Much the same that my friends eat when they go to Taiwan (so I've heard).  So, here is a list of things you should try:  Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (San bei ji).  Chunked chicken is a sauce made from garlic, basil, ginger, dried red peppers, soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil.   Scallion Pancake with Egg..  Think of an omlette.  Yea, sounds weird, just try it.  Taiwanese Sausage.  Its just sliced sausage, with garlic (raw).  Try it.  Taiwanese sausage fried rice.  The above in fried rice, enough said.  Beef with Chinese hot pepper.  Be prepared for the fire, but this is an excellent dish.  Pork with Bean Sprouts and Shrimp (i think that's the name)  That should give you a good starting point.  The service is not perfect, but better than you should expect from most Asian establishments.  I am giving this a 5-star rating because this is the best Taiwanese food you can find in Pittsburgh (and anywhere, and I've tried a few outside of Pittsburgh).",

I remember the hype of \"the first GOOD bubble tea place in Pittsburgh\" and it really did live up to being just that. Then I would come here and get my fix of beef noodle soup, rice with braised pork, rice with pork chops, sausage fried rice, etc. and leave pretty happy.   But no longer. I came here this past week (nov 2008) and was very much disappointed. Perhaps if I came without the expectation of it being pretty good, I might have given this place 3 stars. But, the let down is not forgivable and I fear that I will opt never to come back here again. And to think, I used to rave about this place to other people?!! The food was excessively oily, with no distinguishable flavors except salt and soy sauce. The service was pretty pathetic too. Besides the employees, I think I only saw one other table of Chinese people out of a pretty full restaurant. That should've tipped me off in the first place!  So, please do NOT call this place authentic Taiwanese food. Ugh, the good ratings for this place kind of makes me wanna puke.",

What this is, however, is homestyle Taiwanese Chinese cuisine. In fact, it's so homestyle that my friends who grew up in Taiwan found the place quite boring--\"This is basically what my mom would make.\"  For me, however, the food was wonderful. I love the Taiwanese Sausage, the shredded pancakes, the marinated beef. If you order something that's actually from the Taiwanese Chinese cuisine, I think you'll be impressed. Pay particular attention to the front page meal deals.  The \"cafe\" in the name comes from its origins--it was originally just a small cafe that served bubble tea and some random Taiwanese snacks. Several years ago they renovated and turned into a tiny restaurant. The decor improved dramatically and I do enjoy sitting there to eat. Their bubble tea is still some of the best in Pittsburgh, so be sure to give that a try.",

    "text": "To stay consistent with the other reviews I have... this place is one of the three best places in Pittsburgh that I miss with all my heart. I went to school there, and Rose Tea has quite grown on me. Somehow it has wonderful and quite possibly the best Taiwanese food I've ever had. But this could be because I only really started digging Taiwanese a year or two ago.  I used to stick with the shredded beef with Chinese hot peppers because my Korean American friends used to tell me that it was the closest dish to Korean food, and I tend to agree. However, once I discovered the wondrous Taiwanese Chuck Chicken (\"San Bei Ji\") and the Taiwanese Meatball (in Chinese it said something like Lion's Head on the menu) the flame was on. There's something oddly addicting to Taiwanese food that sets itself apart from other Chinese cuisines. Cantonese has a splash of meaty, greasy flavor, Beijing is crisp and dry, Sichuan kicks you in the mouth with the spices, Guizhou is surprisingly refreshing and clean despite the full-scale flavor, and on and on... But Taiwanese cuisine has some common ingredient in it that this Americanized-but-still-broadly-appreciative-Korean-boy got hooked to. I have yet to figure that out yet.  Oh, and they have great bubble teas too. Almost forgot. I miss you Rose!",

I went with friends to this place 3 times while being a student, which was not long ago. Every time, the place never provided great service. The owner, who is behind the counter, was not very welcoming. The waiters had done a much better job than she did.  We ordered several dishes, and tried them out. I can firmly say, being of Taiwanese descent, that the food was not Taiwanese food as they say they are. The strong flavorings covered the soggy meat and vegetables, which made the food taste very cheap. The portions were quite small, and truly I'm not amazed.  The bubble tea was not really bubble tea either. It's just tea with powdered flavoring, with milk covering the overall taste. It does not taste like tea.  Most of my friends who loves food agrees that they would not visit the place again in the future. In fact, if you talk to various people, some might give you stories on how mistreated they were when they dine there.  Oh, and make sure you bring cash too. The place requires $15 or more for use of credit card. Honestly, I've never seen a place that required such high minimum for the use of plastic. It's not student friendly also as many of them use plastic as their main payment.",

The place is sort of dirty and the tables are always sort of sticky and grimy. I could overlook that and come back because the fish with basil is so good. This past Saturday I took my girlfriend here for dinner. We ordered a few plates of food and after eating ordered bubble tea. We were talking quietly having a good time (still in the restaurant a total time of less than an hour) and the waitress comes over and says \"You need to leave. We need the table\". I was shocked! There were several open tables and not many people waiting. I wish I could have taken my 20% tip back. I thought they're shitty service was based on me being some white guy but after reading others I feel better knowing there is no race or gender discrimination in their shitty service. Won't come back and spread the word to several friends and family members.",

    "text": "I used to go here back when I went to Carnegie Mellon.  This is probably the best Taiwanese food I've had so far -- better than what I find in NY.  It's probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.    Restaurant / Service - Pretty casual restaurant.  Not that big at all and you can see them making bubble tea all the time at their bubble tea to go bar.  Sometimes it can be hard to get a table during lunch time or dinner time but if you go at 1pm or at 6pm vs. at 12 or 7pm then you're more likely to get a table. They are closed once a week so make sure to call em and see if they are open (usually it's a Monday or Tuesday that they are closed--kinda random but I know another chinese restaurant that does the same).  The service is pretty fast. You just go in, order and they bring it to you as quickly as possible.    Food - AWESOME! The end.  hahah jk.  They have great lunch specials (6.25).  My favorites are the beef stew over rice, taiwanese fried chicken with sauteed pork and vegetables over rice with a boiled egg, taiwanese pork chop over rice and curry over rice (tastes like my dad's).  Everything's so well made there that you can't go wrong with anything really.  I once got kimchi chigae (korean @ a taiwanese rest?!) but it was really good and my friend Jay who's korean liked it as well.  Taiwanese chunk chicken, fried fish cake, dumplings, and salt n' pepper porkchops are also my staples here.  The bubble tea is also really good here.  I always get a bubble tea with my meal.  I think this place introduced me to bubble tea actually.  Wow special times.    Price - Lunch specials 6.25?!  This is why I went here at least once a week back in college :)   If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh and craving asian food, go here and then if you want dessert afterwards, go to dozen cupcake shop around the corner :)",

We walked in asking for a table for 3, they said to wait even though there was a couple open tables. A group of five with no reservation showed up after us and was immediately seated, then a group of two showed up with no reservation and took the last table. I told the person seating everyone \"you do realize you just seated two groups after us?\", he replied with \"you're gonna have to wait 5-10 minutes\". We left and went to a 'Bangkok specific' restaurant a block away instead where we were immediately seated AND were entertained by authentic Thai dances while our food was made. I definitely recommend this 'Bangkok' place waaay over rose tea.",

Theirs is the best I've ever tasted and Rose Tea Cafe is comparable.    Their Green Milk Tea (or jasmine milk tea in other places) was the perfect hint of tea.  The consistency was not too thin or thick.  Their actual tapioca balls... I don't recall whether they were exceptional but they weren't bad.    The food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.  Now, the BAD...  the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  If you come around dinnertime- 6p or 7p, you really have to wait an hour for two people.  It's also a very narrow room so the waitresses are constantly tripping around people waiting by the door.  I just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day.",

Their three cup chicken is unmatched anywhere else!   Even their milk tea is fantastic!  Perfect blend of milk and tea flavor with tasty sweet chewy tapioca balls.

The waiters/waitresses are friendly with you after you start interacting with them. You can tell they are not really sincere.  Our second visit to Rose Tea was not that pleasant. After paying we left forgetting to leave a tip. Right after we walked out the door, a waitress came out running behind us yelling you forgot to leave a tip! I was like \"OMG...are you serious?!\" Like you'd rush out to catch up to a customer for tips! I was embarrassed that I had forgotten but more shocked to learn that they'd something like that!

I would go there again to give the bubble tea and the rest of the menu another shot.  UPDATE: went back recently, and had the salt and pepper fish with rice. Lovely.

The menu is 75% hot/spicy for those faint of heart, flavors are strong but balanced.  I've eaten many styles of Chinese foods in the past and this style is very different but still very good.  My reservation of giving them a 5th star is not knowing the menu but I have time to tour the other items and then I'll update this review.  I had the Country Spare Ribs (because the \"motherland\" couple next to me ordered it) it was terrific.",

The woman sat us at a booth and I requested to chairs for my infants as they are not able to sit in booster seats. After sitting for a while the server came and told us that we cannot sit in the booth where we were assigned or he would have to give us booster seats. To be honest with you I wanted to punch him in his throat. But I did not want to cause a scene, and I am not that kind of person. Instead I said okay thank you gather my things and my husband and I left to go to another restaurant nearby",

I've been disappointed each time I've given them business.   Both times, the boba tea is just sad. Powdered mixes, hardly any boba, wayyyy expensive for the size of the drink, and it's usually mostly giant chunks of ice instead of beverage.  I have tried the green tea mint milk tea, and the peanut milk tea. Meh. I've had way better. I will have to find a different place to have my fix met.   The servers seemed disinterested and unfriendly. When coming in, if you just want boba, go up to the counter.  They were a little dismissive when I asked for clarification on one of the other flavors. Informing me that most of their stuff was powdered mixes, which was a bummer to hear.   The food, when we had it, were dinner specials. The food seemed overly salty, sad, and unauthentic.    Unless this place completely changes the way it does boba, I won't be back.",

They made simple dishes such as fried rice and lo mein stand out as they were fresh and flavorful.  This last visit left me feeling sad and disappointed.  We were the only people in the restaurant, yet we were sat next to a big wall of plastic (I think they are expanding) that had a freezing cold breeze blowing on my legs the entire meal.  We ordered a bubble drink and requested two flavors (strawberry/passion fruit) and was told \"No.  You can only have one flavor.\" After offering to pay extra for the second flavor, we were still told \"No.\"  We got scallion pancake with egg as an appetizer and I ordered egg drop soup in an attempt to warm myself up.  Both were good.  In fact, the scallion pancake with egg was probably the highlight of our meal.   We had the kids with us and got Pork Lo Mein, Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Curry.  I couldn't even eat the chicken curry.  It did not taste good to me at all.  The lo mein was okay, it tasted very starchy to me, but the kids liked it. The fried rice tasted like it had been sitting for a while.  In closing, I hope this was just a fluke as it was during the Holiday Season.  It would be sad to see a place that I really loved go down the tubes.",

Mango bubble tea was amongst the best I've ever had.  Dumplings, steamed, also great but oddly small with little filling or the few that had none.  Marinated pork was awful. I ended up throwing the entire dish away, which was about $10. I tried 1 bite and had no idea what protein substance was in it. Definitely tasted more like beef. Whatever it was marinated in was awful. Had random vegetables like corn and lettuce which I would assume the corn was from a can and the lettuce was passed ripe. I wouldn't say the place was awful, I just think the food needs more of a touch up",

I don't think the wait time has ever been more than ten minutes for takeout, which is awesome.  The bubble tea is pretty good, although once I ordered the strawberry milkshake ($3.50), which is just strawberry milk.  It was too sweet and fake tasting for me.  The shrimp lo mein ($8.50) is pretty good and makes 1.5 meals.  They use the cute little shrimp too, which I like.  I am more inclined to head to Everyday Noodles for my noodle needs, though.    My biggest complaint is that I have tried to get lunch here twice at 11:30, and the doors are locked but the staff is inside.  Their door says that they open at 11.  This issue has stopped me from returning recently.",

Maybe I ordered wrong- and so did my friend- and so did we both with the app- but everything tasted like a chopped challenge where the task was to make a \"fancy dinner\" with cafeteria food.   Started with corn chicken soup for two-not even terrible, but bland af and honestly not even as flavorful as the straight up chicken broth I sometimes have for dinner when I plan to wear something skintight but accidentally ate a whole pizza and twelve beers for lunch.   Both of us ordered off the back page of the menu which I would imagine is similar to backpage the website in terms of quality. I ordered shrimp in lobster sauce which is like ordering a stripper named Chanel. Cheap and ends in remorse. This beauty came with canned, prob microwaved cafeteria veg medley, bland warmed up baby shrimp and \"lobster sauce\" less aptly named than Apple Jacks. And way less nutritious. Probably a cream of something(?) can of soup I swear to god.  Friend had pork belly- also off ironically located and named backpage of the menu. He didn't eat it. He eats anything. For example, he dated me.  Rice was edible because it was rice and probably the only thing not canned and microwaved.  In their defense the menu is HUGE (yuge) so maybe there are some things that are not so cheap and bad. We just didn't order them.  Anyway I came here starving. Anything should have tasted good. But instead I left angry that I wasted money and calories on canned cafeteria food I could have made better at home. We got a frozen pizza and obvs stopped at the liquor store on the way home.   Nice waiter good luck to him!!",

Came back here again last night because the boyfriend sprained his toe so we are eating whatever he wants to eat. After giving Rose Tea another chance, I'll admit I'm glad I did. It's a small, busy Taiwanese restaurant. We went for dinner on a Sunday night at 6:30pm and had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. Ordered the deep fried salt & pepper squid (a bit too salty, but still good that we ate most of it) and the short ribs w eggplant (very good, although I didn't try the eggplant). He got the lychee green tea (which he loved but I thought was too sweet) and I got the black milk tea w wheat germ (which I loved but he thought was just good, not great). Portions are great; these two dishes were more than enough for two people. The lady who took our order was friendly and adorable. She tried to squeeze behind me a couple times during the meal and joked in Mandarin that she needed to lose weight (she doesn't!). This was probably my best experience here in terms of food. Their bubble teas have always been good.   Given my precious experiences here, I'm not sure if I would give it an overall rating of 3 or 4; 3.5 seems about right. This experience alone though was probably a 4.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5",

The gentleman waiter was friendly enough when we first got there. Helped my friend pick out a new dish and it was fantastic. We split the vegetable rice noodles and the chicken with Chinese hot pepper. I'm glad he ordered what he did because my noodles were just okay. But together, they made a great meal. The chicken was incredibly flavorful.   After our meal was finished a woman, I'm assuming the owner? stopped by to chat. She was so friendly and appreciated our positive feedback.   Definitely give this place a try. Had my friend not been a fan I may not have ever stopped in. It's an unassuming place, simple and plain interior.",

We walked down the street and stumbled into Rose Tea Cafe. The server was a friendly guy who was able to point us in the right direction. The chunk chicken that my buddy ordered was delicious. It was very similar to a Thai basil chicken dish but with chunked up chicken instead of ground up. I appreciate the word \"chunk\" so that was an added bonus. It also made me think of the Houston, TX slang of \"chunk up the deuce\" which means to throw a peace sign to somebody. I ordered a bone in pork chop over rice. It had a sweet BBQ-like sauce that was not bad. I was trying to keep my cost low at around $9 because there is a $15 credit card minimum.",

    "text": "I've gotten takeout from here once, and also came in for lunch one day, so I think I can safely call this four-star food.  When we got take out, the only thing I can remember for sure that we ordered was the Shredded Beef with Chinese Hot Pepper, and it was SPICY!  I remember we needed a lot of beverage along with that one.  We really liked it though, and I remember it was fresh-tasting compared to most take-out.  When I came in for lunch, I arrived right when they open for the day (I want to say 1130 am on a Monday).  I was really excited to have bubble tea, but they said it wasn't available yet - they have to make the tapioca pearls, or let them cool, or something like that.  Bummer!  But I can't argue with that, I don't want hot, malformed bubbles in my tea.  So wait an hour after they open if you want boba.  The menu was HUGE, and descriptionless, so it's pretty hard to figure out what you want.  Just take a guess.  I went for the Ma Po Spicy Bean Curd, which is vegetarian (although I think, traditionally, there is also meat in the dish).  The portion was massive, both hot in temperature and spice level.  The beautiful steaming bowl was filled with soft, almost creamy tofu, and vegetables (frozen ones) swimming in sauce.  I have to say, it was pretty darn good.  I didn't even miss the meat or wish that the vegetables hadn't come from a bag.  There was so much food, I ate Ma Po Tofu for nearly three meals.  It's a bargain.  The server was very nice too, prompt and helpful.  Can't wait to come back, try more things on the menu, and get bubble tea!",

I was far outside Taipei for the better part of a month and was able to find (with help) several local, non-touristy places to eat.  Absolutely some of the best meals I have ever eaten - and sometimes the most exciting.  This is why I was thrilled to find the Rose Tea Cafe.  I don't think dining here will ever duplicate my Taiwan experiences because there are certain things that just will not translate well as ingredients may not be accessible or customers may not provide the demand.  However, the basics are here, the food if fresh and exciting, and every meal had left me remembering that great month in Taiwan.  Xie xie, RTC.",

I ordered the eggplant basil w/tofu, shredded pork with bamboo (extra spicy), and chinese watercress.  The food was delicious as usual and not over sugared/oily.  Two things that struck out with me:  1. I was pressured to use cash- to the point that it was uncomfortable when I repeatedly told them I didn't have cash.  2. The prices have been rising over the past year.  For those 3 items, I paid $39+, which seems exorbitantly high for 2 vegetarian dishes and a pork/bamboo dish.  I could easily have walked down the block for cheaper and just-as-tasty food.    I left feeling somewhat ripped off and disrespected.  But then again, the food is tasty so I guess it depends how much you're willing to pay.  Probably won't go there again in a long while.",

I joke, but really, the portions are generous without the food lacking in flavor. The food isn't heavy at all and I would say it's seasoned quite well. The downfall of a lot of Taiwanese food places is when the food tastes heavy and just makes you want to sleep right afterwards.  I would have to say that this place is busy almost all the time, but hopefully you are willing to wait for it because it's definitely a place I would go more than once. The boba is pretty good for Pittsburgh and I would say if you do want to try boba, you should get it here.",

It's been a while, but I'll venture a crack at my typical Chinese mother and her needs to eat the food of her people regardless of where she's at (yes, we did dine on Chinese near the Spanish Steps of Rome).  Surprisingly though, the Taiwanese food here is better than what you can find in Singapore. Weird. I know.   This time around we found some better options to pick at this joint... faves stand as follows:   - beef noodle soup  - three cup squid (think of the three cup chicken but with squid) - pig's blood spicy hot blood -- okay this is not for the faint of heart, or the non-adventurous, but I found it delicious, esp. ladled over a bowl of rice - and to throw in some green (you know, for digestion), their simple stir-fried veg is nice and tasty  But you can pass over some of the other mediocre dishes, like the lu rou fan (the minced meat over rice) and their curry seafood dishes.   Service isn't stellar, but when you compare to the likings of China and Singapore, it's bloody fantastic. Not to mention you can order take out as well. Oh, and we didn't meet the boss lady from hell, so that must of colored my review more favorably.  What can I say? My standards seem to have dropped. Asia's making me jaded.",

I mean, it was the only reason I overlooked an entire page of great lunch deals and ordered dinner entrees instead.   But I digress. Bottomline: RTC delivers lip smackin' good Taiwanese cooking.   The Taiwanese chunk chicken was solid in taste and in presentation. Though it was saltier than the version I'm used to in Columbus, it was delicious nonetheless (although skimpier on portion size.) The salt and pepper fish was unique in its own ways -- the most notable being the absence of peppercorn, which boded well. It wasn't until I was perusing the extensive bubble tea menu that I saw the lunch specials along with the accompanying bubble tea specials. The pork chop over rice sounded promising and tasted just as good as the previous two entrees. The pork chop itself was fried to the right amount of crisp, and the rice itself could have easily made for a meal as it was the infamous Taiwanese braised pork rice.  A good way of ending a meal here -- especially on days when scalding temperatures are reached -- is with a bubble tea. The lychee with extra jelly did the trick for me.  As for service, every server and employee were polite and courteous. No encounters with any surly owners were had.",

Portion was deceptively small -- my girlfriend and I ordered only the scallion pancake and this, and we were both full afterwards and brought home leftovers.   And now the sad part -- for a place that markets itself as a tea place, the tea wasn't good. I got the normal black milk tea with boba, and it was watery and the bubbles weren't firm.

It was so artificial tasting and overly sweet we couldn't drink it. We ended up just throwing it away. The mango was not horrible, just wasn't that good honestly. Both drinks tasted like powder. They were so gritty it just lingered in your mouth after taking a drink. Once I got to the bottom of my drink I got a mouthful of the powder. I almost had to spit it out.   I wouldn't recommend EVER getting bubble tea from here. It's not worth it unless you like powder and water.   I've not had their food so I can't comment on that. That's why I have two stars because I've not had the entire experience of the place.   We also tried to pay with a card for our drinks and the lady asked if we could instead just pay with cash? Very strange if you ask me. I assume it had something to do with a surcharge fee. I just don't think you should ask customers to change their payment especially if they don't have cash.",

    "text": "My absolute go-to bubble tea spot. They were the first, and they are the best. Variety of flavors and sizes, and the tapioca pearls are soft but not mushy. Just the right amount of bounce! They do not have the tendency to be occasionally hard and undercooked like other tea places. I usually get the Jasmine green tea, no milk, with tapioca. It isn't as sweet as some of the flavored teas and there is a fresh jasmine tea flavor. Flavored milk teas are excellent but more like a dessert drink than an iced tea.   I was waiting until I tried their food to review them, and that was fantastic too! I ordered the tofu with chinese pepper. Had a really wonderful taste! Not too oily or too spicy. Perfectly seasoned. Tofu was chewy with crunchy exterior. It was really excellent. I can't wait to try more food from here!",

    "text": "I was visiting Pittsburgh after not having been back for a few years and was looking forward to having Rose Tea. I haven't found a great Taiwanese restaurant in NY yet so I was craving dinner at Rose Tea. The renovated the place and its a lot bigger. It looks great, but also makes the space feel pretty empty when there aren't a lot of people dining. My three friends and I were really hungry so we ended up ordering a lot of food, probably more than we should've, but we had leftovers which was a plus! One downfall was that our food came out cold. Our Seafood Chow Fun was actually cold and the green beans were not hot. They offered to remake both dishes, which was very nice of them, but we were not happy with the cold dishes  The flakiness of the Scallion Pancakes with Beef was perfect and the beef had a nice marinade to it. Overall I really liked this appetizer. It comes with 6 decently sized pieces.   Beef Noodle Soup I was most excited about the soup because I've been craving it for awhile now. It wasn't what I expected and the noodles had no taste to them. The broth and beef were mediocre.   Seafood Chow Fun This dish came out cold but they ended up remaking it for us, which I was very happy about. I loved the peanuts and veggies in the dish that added the crunch to the dish and the veggies. The sauce on top was good too.   Taiwanese Chunk Chicken This was probably my favorite dish. The chicken pieces were nice and crispy and the ginger added great flavor. I also loved the wilted basil leaves (?) that were in the dish.   Sauteed Green Beans Super salty, but were one of the only greens we had on the table. It tasted good but was doused in oil and salt.",

I ordered sauteed string beans, Taiwanese spicy short ribs and the pan fried noodles with chicken. All were well seasoned. The ribs were a bit chewy but so flavorful. I would still order. The pan fried noodles had a nice brown sauce and lots of different vegetables:  broccoli, snow peas, mushrooms, carrots, bamboo shoots, celery, and zucchini. I also ordered a hot almond milk tea. So nice. Excellent service. Very clean. I would definitely recommend.",

Took forever to get a table (there were empty tables but not cleared), took forever to ORDER (literally 20 minutes to put in an order), and took forever to get the food or drinks or water. Spent 90 minutes at a cafe joint... I was expecting In&out.   If the food was epic, no harm no foul, but this was FAR FAR FAR from it.  Ordered pork chop on rice, stinky tofu, pickled veg with shredded pork noodle soup and beef with flat noodle.    Pork chop was under-seasoned and tasted like cardboard.  Stinky tofu was aiight - nothing to write home about, the noodle soup's soup tasted like water with salt, and the flat noodle was over oily (that was my bad, it is Chinese food so it has to be oily).    Then we order the bubble tea... it is 20 degrees (fahrenheit - not celisus for my asian comrades) outside and yet they still filled it 20% with ICE...",

If you're new to Asian food, or rose tea, or a halfway point between traditional food and americanized Asian food, order the Taiwanese chunk chicken. Their pork & shrimp with bamboo shoots is fantastic. Pro tip, order it with low sodium.",

I'm usually good with spicy food but I was definitely challenged with this dish. I recommend ordering this with another dish to even out the spice levels and allow you to enjoy your meal without constantly drinking water to calm your palate. A recent favorite of mine is the Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice! It's so good and it complements the Shredded Beef with Green Peppers really well. I wouldn't recommend the bubble tea here though because I think they use powder and you can taste it in the drink.   Okay UPDATE on the Shredded Beef with Green Peppers. It's no longer extremely spicy... I think they might have changed it so that it is less spicy because when I got it recently it was not spicy at all and my friend who ordered it weeks after I did said the same thing.  Service is okay and the interior can be a bit dim.",

    "text": "Jack Dawson was planning to make Rose Tea. But then he froze to death and it never transpired. Still it was a nice idea. And this idea was finally brought to fruition by the owners of this Bubble Tea and Taiwanese Food place in the heart of posh, fancy, adorable Squirrel Hill in the hoity toity part of Pittsburgh - one of the most underrated cities in America.  What to get: Chunk Chicken is omg good, Bubble Tea is excellent (but very sweet), especially the Passionate Temptation special with Lychee Jelly. What else: There's another kind of Passionate Temptation here, but only when I'm inside.  I get rather excited in the nether regions when I come here, hence the name \"Grows Tea Cafe.\"  So in terms of food, my favourite is what they recommended to me the first time. It's slightly pricey, a huge portion and very filling, but their Chunk Chicken is a Taiwanese specialty, juicy and moist (ahem), steaming hot and full of delicious flavour. I highly recommend anyone that likes Asian dishes and enjoys trying new things, give this one a try. It's as good as the Chunk Chickens I've had in NYC, and that is a very high compliment.  They always talk me into ordering things I don't want. I shrug and give in. Which is why I call it \"I Suppose Tea Cafe.\"  Even better, perhaps, are their astounding selections of inventive bubble teas. The Milk Teas are good, the Fruity Teas are great, but perhaps best of all are their magnificent specials, including the Blue one (I forgot what it's called, but it's very blue and very good), and my favourite - the Passionate Temptation, which I get pretty much every time I come here. I didn't enjoy it as much the last time, perhaps because I'd already had too much Bubble Tea for one day, and it is rather sweet. You could, I suppose, order it with less sweetness. But the little Passion Fruit seeds inside really take it over the edge. And if you get it with Lychee Jelly instead of bubbles, it's even sexier.  If the music is being played too loud, that'll be because it's known as BOSE Tea Cafe.  Service is hit or miss. The woman is okay, a little abrupt. The guy is quiet. Some of the other employees can be lacking in customer service. But then some of the employees are super helpful, like the awesome girl who helped me pick out my order the first time I came here. I've been here many times since and will visit mostly every time I come to Pitt, including last week when I grabbed myself another Passionate Temptation, and yes I mean the drink.  If your order smells bad, then it's better to call it Nose Tea Cafe.  Having had so many great Bubble Teas now, it's not at the very top of the list, but RTC easily earns 5 stars. The other location in Oakland is not as good, and even less friendly, so my advice is to stick to this one.  And this review is so long, the place should be renamed Prose Tea Cafe.",

It's a good sign in any Asian restaurant that the food is good if the clientele is 95% Asian. In fact aside from myself, the only non-Asian people coming in were grabbing bubble tea to go. And, their mango bubble milk tea was delicious! I had seafood chow fun & the sauce was light & tasty. The noodles were perfect & it was packed with mussels, shrimp, scallops & squid. The others in my party all enjoyed their dishes as well. Veggies were fresh & meats were tender. Not to mention none of our dishes cost over $8.95 and they were HUGE portions. I was the only non-Asian in my party of 4, and my relatives were in from Chicago & we all agreed we would definitely eat here again. The food here is Taiwanese, not Cantonese so dishes vary slightly. Their beef stew over rice with gravy looked fantastic, it's on their $7.95 specials menu & comes with tons of tender beef, veggies & an egg and a double serving of white rice. Try it if you're strolling down Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill, especially if Everyday Noodles across the street is too crowded.",

My last gushing is about the Taiwanese sausage, which had great flavor.  My family didn't like the red bean milkshake or consistency of the milk tea (too thin) as much. They also prefer you pay with cash. Be careful of the stair, that doesn't look different from the floor, that separates the left and right side! Not a ton of seating either.

It is definitely one of the best bubble teas in the city. Another thing that is a definite is great food. You can never go wrong with authentic food. The lunch menu do wonders for us, college students.   So, why just 3 stars? Well, one last thing that is always certain is... poor service. You can be sure, you will always have to wait forever to get a table. When you do a get a table, you will have to wait forever to get your order taken because they are understaffed. Due to the small space and lack of waiting space, you will have to endure others waiting for a table glaring down at you as you enjoy your food. Because every second you are spending in bliss with the delicious food, is another second others must wait. Adding on the servers trying to get you out as soon as possible, you will feel rush throughout the meal. Let's just say, If you looking for a place with smiles and bright faces, this is not the place to go. But you are willing to sacrifice all that for some delicious bubble tea and food, then this is place for you.",

My favorite is their string beans with garlic sauce and on the last time I was there, it was sold out (I blatantly stared at the table who got the last of it). I also like their sauteed sliced pork with leeks and filet fish with black bean sauce (very tender fish).  Tawainese food is different from typical Chinese food if you ever eat more than just delivery/takeout Chinese food. I really liked the taste of it and we always finished every last morsel of our food.   The place is a little small so you may have to wait a bit to get a spot but it's worth it.  We usually parked in a lot behind Dunkin Donuts, which cost a small fee but I am horrible at parallel parking so it worked for me.",

On top of all that, this place has got to have the longest menu I've ever seen, and I've seen endless ones at other Asian-restaurants.  Points though for serving hard-to-find fried, stinky tofu and generous portions. Nothing tasted completely satisfying but I was definitely full.",

FYI, Taiwanese cuisine is different from typical Chinese cuisine in that it tends to be milder and lighter with some Japanese influence (there are exceptions, of course, such as beef noodle soup).  So Rose Tea is a perfect alternative if you're tired of greasy Chinese food drowning in sauce, but don't come in expecting classic Taiwanese dishes to be bursting with a gazillion different flavors and spices.  You may even find it bland or boring, but then you'd probably be the type who mixes all the flavors and toppings at Razzy Fresh and enjoys Panda Express.  For me, though, Rose Tea hits the spot.  The place is always cramped and service tends to be rushed and impersonal, but it doesn't really detract from enjoying a casual meal.",

However, I happened upon this little restaurant and heard from another Chinese guy that this place was actually decent.  I was surprised to find that they are actually a Taiwanese establishment.  So, going back to my younger days eating authentic Taiwanese food in socal, I decided on the Pork Chops with Rice.  When the food came, the plate contained 2 nicely fried pieces of Taiwanese-style pork chop that were actually really tasty - a  little hint of sweetness, well seasoned, and not dry.  A portion of rice, preserved vegetables, and a soy-sauce hard boiled egg topped it off.   Also ordered the passion fruit tea with tapioca.  Pretty damn tasty.   AT $6.25 for the plate and another $2.50 for the drink, it was actually quite a deal.    I've yet to try their black bean sauce noodle (which the waiter said was excellent), but for now I'm pretty surprised at how good the food was.  As a newly transplanted San Franciscan in Pittsburgh, I'm super hesitant to try any form of Asian food, but this dish was legit.",

Unfortunately, I think their business has gone down considerably since when I used to go 5-6 years ago. I went the other night and ordered one of their quick dinner combo plates (lobster and shrimp) that came with a side of vegetables and rice. The lobster and shrimp portion was a confusing stew that tasted like MSG. I'm exaggerating, but I wasn't impressed. And the vegetable part was this really sad portion of canned corn. The food was NOT okay. Of course, I definitely did not order the right dish - my parents used to order their special dishes, but at the time, I was eating on-the-go by myself, and did not have time to sit down and eat several dishes. Also, I didn't know this, but they don't accept card for purchases under $15, and my dish was less than $10. Luckily, the manager let me slide, but that policy is pretty annoying, especially considering that they are located right next to a college campus (which college kid who wants to grab a meal on-the-go carries cash anymore?).",

I wanted to give it another try.   So my friends and I ordered a lot of food, about 5 appetizers (stinky tofu, taro cake, scallion and egg pancakes, and some others). All of the appetizers were great. I loved the scallion pancakes with the egg and beef. Good stuff!   The stinky tofu was what I was waiting for. I decided to smell it again to see if it would reignite any memories. Nothing came forward, but it was stinky. I ate one and I could taste the stink. Not as strong as I thought it would be. Now my Taiwanese friends tell me that the Rose Tea Cafe's version is definitely not as strong as what is produced in Taiwan, and I think I'm very thankful for this. But overall I enjoyed it and would have it again and even try a stronger version of it.  Really good Mango smoothy. And their main entree dishes were just as good. At the end of the feeding frenzy, I was pushing the limits of my belt. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm definitely stopping by here.",

So for some reason, I have a lot of Taiwanese friends, and I found myself eating at the only Taiwanese restaurant in State College quite often when I went to Penn State. Rose Tea Cafe, for me, didn't exactly measure up to that. I know I'm super lame, but I wish they had more noodle-based dishes, so that was a little disappointing for me. I ended up ordering the spicy short ribs. I really, really loved the sauce on them, a little sweet almost like a General Tso's but spicier and and the portion size was huge! However, when I think short ribs, I think of tender meat and delicious, soft fat. These were rather tough and the fat was chewy and inedible. But like I said, the sauce was amazing, so I'm definitely going to give this place another shot. All the weird things like intestines and smelly tofu and cuttlefish balls on the menu make me want to love it for authenticity's sake. Also, dinner service was extremely fast!  I do come here often for the boba tea, which is probably the best in the city. The first time I went, I decided to be \"adventurous\" and get something that consisted of non-dairy creamer, egg, boba, and green apple syrup. Bad idea, but that was my fault. I should've taken the facial expression of the woman at the counter when I ordered as a warning.  Next time I just did the black milk tea. Much better!",

    "text": "Being raised in a Taiwanese family in L.A., I have been tasted a lot of great Chinese as well as great Taiwanese food. That being said, Rose Tea Cafe is the best and most authentic Chinese food restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Rose Tea Cafe started out mostly as a Bubble Tea store then became serving hot food after a few years.  I really believe Rose Tea has hit a home run with their food.  They are about as authentic as one can get.  From squid soup with rice noodles (100% Taiwanese) to Chinese Meatballs to Chunk Chicken to Watercress, their menu has more variety than any Chinese menu in Pittsburgh.  It also doesn't offer any Americanized menu.  The taste is heavenly, reminding several some of my Chinese classmates of their mothers' home cooking.  Their best dish is the Chunk Chicken, or as Chinese call it, \"Three Cup Chicken\".  The chicken is cooked with basil and garlic.  Its chicken is never dry like several LA places would make them and the basil and garlic add a great flavor and fragrance to the dish.  Other favorites include shredded pork cooked with bean curd, Taiwanese sausage and Pork Intestine.  Not everything at Rose Tea is great.  For example, the Chinese Meatballs are not very chewy and the squid soup may taste bland at times.  By Pittsburgh (and East Coast) standards, however, they are still quite good.  It would be a crime if the bubble tea is not reviewed.  Opinions vary a lot here.  Many people like the taro and almond bubble tea.  Personally, I feel the tapioca pearls are very chewy and not as unchewable as Orient Express'.  However, its milk tea is not that good; milk feels absent from its taste.  Overall, their bubble tea is nothing special.  I really expected a lot from them in the bubble tea department since it is a Taiwanese drink.  Now onto prices, service and parking.  Overall, Rose Tea prices are very reasonable.  However its appetizers can be quite pricey and come in unnecessarily big portions.  For example, a plate of bean curds or seaweed costs nearly $6.  Lunch specials cost just about the same.  Service is quite averge.  Don't expect your American-fare service.  One particular waitress I've had regularly would also keep suggesting food after I specifically mentioned that I've ordered enough.   They also rarely smile.  Parking is not bad if you know where to park.  Street parking or parking in the lot across from the restaurant costs a few quarters.  There's free parking at Giant Eagle, which requires a little bit of walking.  But I repeat: one's free and one's not.  Bottom line Pros: Good authentic food, great variety Cons: Service",

Coming into the place I saw an immediate great sign- the place was packed! My friend and I only waited a few minutes for a table and were greeted immediately. I ordered the peach green bubble tea and she ordered the passion green bubble tea- they were both sweet, smooth and fresh tasting!  The only problem we experienced with the service was the rush we both felt to make a decision but we quickly made up our minds. I went against my gut of getting the chunk chicken and decided to play it safe w chicken lo mien my friend, who is a vegetarian went with the sauteed eggplant which looked awesome.  Quickly after ordering our food was brought to us in giant sized portions and was piping hot. The food tasted authentic but was a little on the greasy side but nonetheless I really enjoyed rose tea and would definitely go there again soon.",

Even my girlfriend (who is from LA) enjoyed it, though she was bothered by the price ($3.75).  The food here was very tasty as well.  We had xiang gan rou si (beef with tofu) and a beef noodle soup that were both excellent.  In fact, they were so good that we came back to this restaurant the next day for take out food for the drive home.  According to my girlfriend, the xiang gan rou si was prepared how it was supposed to be done :)  We were very pleasantly surprised.",

You judge a boba place by its plain milk tea anyways and it was thumbs up in my opinion.  Ask for the BIG BOBA or else they give you the little ones and then your big straw is just useless.

When I told them how much I enjoyed my first Bubble Tea experience there was no response.  Isn't that weird?  And when they took the plates I again complimented the food.  Same response.

I came in many times for my milk tea yet never stopped to try the food for the longest time. I did get to see the food pass by as I waited for my bubble tea to be made. It always looked and smelled so great that I finally decided to stop in before a movie one night.  Since that first dinner, I have stopped by several more times for dinner. We always get the Yeung Chow fried rice and fried dumplings. The fried rice is some of the best in the area, while the dumplings are passable.  I have tried several of the dinners on the menu: pork belly with kimchee, stewed pork belly, spicy chicken in a casserole, and spicy short ribs. I have really enjoyed all of them. The flavors are all rather wonderful. I am still looking for that dinner entree that I crave, but I know I will continue to return due to my craving for the Almond Milk Tea with Pearls.",

We ordered our tea and he told us there was a 5 dollar minimum (which was stated on the very back of the menu). We decided to not leave and go to the place across the street and ordered food. I ordered marinated \"pork\" over rice and instead got sloppy joe meat, mixed frozen vegetables, and poorly cooked rice. Instead of complaining about the food, I paid for it. We walked out without leaving tip due to terrible food, service, and drinks. As we were walking  out, one lady chased us out and told us we had to leave a tip. Keep in mind that our server was sitting in the back, never talked to us, and never came to check on us. This was disappointing overall, and the people were so rude. Never again.",

    "text": "Used to come here often while I was going to school nearby. For its proximity to campus, I would say it was very good. They have a lot of menu options to choose from, and the food tastes great. By far my favorite dish is the chunk chicken (or three cup chicken if you take the literal translation).  You can also get bubble tea here.  My biggest complaint is the small amount of rice they give you for the amount of food you get. I tried to eat as little amount of rice as I could with each bite, but still there wasn't nearly enough. So I had to ask for more. Most good Chinese restaurants will not charge you for additional rice because it costs very little. So I was surprised when I got my bill that there was an extra charge, especially since I was given no warning or heads up about it at all. If they're going to charge extra for rice, it's polite to inform the client of the charge and ask if they still want it. On top of that, they try to hide the charge by writing it in Chinese so you can't tell unless you really look hard at your check. I don't know if it was just coincidence or another sneaky move, but somehow the extra charge for rice EXACTLY matched the amount of tax. So it was very confusing to determine if it was an extra charge, or them simply doing some weird math on the bill. Fortunately I caught it and had to ask the waiter what that additional charge was, and he confirmed that it was indeed the rice.  It's a shame because outside of that, I would've been very happy with my meal and experience here. But I feel I should give everyone a fair warning in case they make the same mistake.",

The menu is a little bit too long for my liking, but it does provide a wide selection of everything (you can even get stinky tofu here). Every time I come here I just stare blankly at the menu and then get a headache though.  The dishes here are okay. Pretty decent comfort food to me.

The Kim Chi's spicyness is distributed throughout the dish and it's a great flavor along with beef, pork, chicken and shrimp.  My favorite item on the menu. - Papaya Milkshake.  Awesome.  This was for me. - Mango Bubble Tea.  My daughters split it and they loved it.  I had a sip and loved it too. - Curry Chicken Special.  For my wife, this was just the right amount of food for about $8.00.  A total college kid item at the price that came with steamed rice, veggies and a pickled egg.  Very Taiwanese!  Easy going atmosphere with very attentive service.  Great for groups and families with kids.  I need to branch out more on their menu because it is a huge one and the other dishes going out to the other tables were very enticing on my next visit!",

The beef noodle soup is not the best I have had in Pittsburgh but it is cheap (compared to other places) and the portion is huge, perfect for winter or when I am feeling a little homesick. I would recommend adding a little bit of chili oil (ask the waiter to get you some) to the broth, it really enhances the flavor.   The service is ok sometimes, depending on which waiter you get.   They do also have some appetizers that are very commonly seen in Taiwan like the cucumber dish, marinated seaweeds and so on. All the appetizers are decent.  I have ordered some Entrees other than beef noodles on the menu before, but most of them are a little oily and just meh for me.",

    "text": "Its been over 2 years since I have been at this place. I bragged about this place all the time to people visiting in Pittsburgh. I was craving the stinky tofu here and of course since boba runs in my veins, I had to come back and visit. The food was even better than i remembered but I removed stars for the service.   I decided to go with stinky tofu appetizer, the shredded pork and bamboo shoots stir fry, hollow stem vegetable with garlic, and a hot black milk tea with boba. He asked me if I wanted hot or cold and I specifically said \"hot.\" The server also called hollow stem vegetable as watercress, which i then asked him in chinese just to make sure I had ordered the right vegetable. In hind sight, I should have corrected him and let him know that watercress is NOT hollow stem. Perhaps he needed more training, but thank goodness I spoke Chinese and knew what I wanted.   A few things wrong, the server brought my bubble tea and it was cold. She said the server was new and didn't write if I wanted hot or cold. I said I had ordered hot. But then I told her that I would still take the cold drink since its already made, I had been waiting and was super thirsty anyways. The food came out in good timing. The stinky tofu changed slightly from what I remembered. Last time the sauce was sweet. This time, the sauce and fermented cabbage was spicy, which is better this way! I liked this change of flavor. The pork and bamboo was delicious, with very tender bamboo. Lastly, the hollow stem vegetable was non-greasy and lightly seasoned to my liking. After a few sips of my milk tea, it was quite cold at the table by the window so I asked my server if I could swap my cold milk tea back to a hot milk tea since I realized me accepting their mistake was a mistake of my own. He comes back and says that I couldn't since I had already taken a few sips. At this time, I was a bit disappointed with the service so I said I will just pay for a hot one then.   At time of payment, I expressed my disappointment and what happened with the front lady but nothing was done. I packed the rest of my food and left. While my tummy was full and satisfied, I left with a slight bitterness.",

I believe they've cut down a little bit on portion sizing since 8 years ago, but hey, the economy is different.   Anyway, the food here is excellent. Basically anything you get will be a good representation of True Taiwanese food, as long as you pick something from the Taiwanese side of the menu. The one-plate meals are always excellent value, and I'd recommend going for the fried chicken or pork chop. The braised fatty pork is also really good. The San-Bei-Ji is well done here. I also really like the pig intestine hot \"stew\" here as well. Mmmm.... The Beef Noodle Soup is pretty good as well. Of course, bubble tea from Rose Tea is one big reason to visit, and prices are on par for the area.  Service is usually a bit spotty, but they're always busy with the small dining area. Bring your A-game when looking for a seat, because you'll be sniping them. Not gonna lie, it does help if you are Taiwanese.",

I remember Rose Tea back when it was just a bubble tea and small plates place with tacky decorations in bright primary colors. Thank goodness for the improvement in decor and expansion of the menu! Every time I came to Rose Tea I'd leave on the verge of exploding (and then of course I'd head over to Rita's or Coldstone). My favorite dishes: their fried rice, lo mein, shredded beef with hot peppers, pork with baby bamboo shoots, and taiwanese stir fried rice cake. Fantastic bubble tea as well, especially the green tea with milk. Only complaint is that I'm not a big fan of the owner lady - she was always very rude and curt (see review for Lulu's).",

The atmosphere is small and quaint, and it gets pretty packed around eating times. But the food is served very quickly. If you want some really good Taiwainese food, then just check out this place:   Dishes that I recommend:   Beef w. Chinese Watercress in Black Pepper Sauce House Special Stir Fried Rice Cake  Also, the mango smoothie bubble tea is the best at Rose Tea :)",

I haven't left dissatisfied.  Their lunch specials are really good so if you can go during the day, it's a deal.  The place is super tiny and seems to get pretty crowded almost every night for dinner, so go early and don't go in huge groups.  The service is really fast and everyone is friendly...probably my favorite place in the burgh to get Taiwanese/Chinese food.",

    "text": "Love love LOVE Rose Tea Cafe.  The best dumplings and bobo tea in the 'burgh!  I've been searching high and low for the perfect iced bobo tea and dumplings and Rose Tea comes the closest yet.  The tea: Pros:  REAL brewed black tea, consistently good bobo, good flavor, not too sweet.  Cons:  A bit pricely ($3.50 for a small)  I'm a little bit obsessed with finding the perfect iced bobo tea.  I look for 4 things: 1) Real brewed black tea 2) Properly cooked Bobo (firm, but not hard center) 3) Good flavoring 4) Balance (right amount of ice, Bobo, milk/tea)  1)  Tea is consistently delicious. 2)  Usually perfect- a bit firm in the center! 3)  Liquid flavors 4)  Good amount of ice, tea, milk (powdered), bobo.  They use a shaker which really makes all the difference.  Very consistent product!  The dumplings are SUPER fresh, with hand-made wrappers. Also, the portion is great for the price - 8 for $4.50!  My fiance and I got to Rose Tea a lot.  The only major disappointments are the specials on the front of the menu, which are consistently bad.  They also like to rush people out.  Highlights - Taiwanese chunk chicken, sauteed string beans, pan-fried noodles!",

    "text": "I came back here last Friday and tried their Taiwanese Chunk Chicken. Sure, alot of dishes out there have basils and chili peppers, but this dish really shows that it's all about the cooking technique and what time and degrees does to an ingredient. The chicken has incredible flavor in its brown sauce without being overly salty. The soft garlic morsels are caramalized and delicious. The chicken is not tossed in anything but is thinly crunchy on the outside and are bursting juices when you bite into it. I highly recommend an all vegetable dish with this one because it is a large load of salty meat that needs to be counteracted with healthy greens. This is definitely a dish I haven't had anywhere else in the city. Most of the chinese/panasian restaurants seem to cater to american flavor by pouring ingredients, salts, and fats carelessly onto the stove to come up with a generic, likable taste. But in the food, special ingredients, and presentation of all their dishes, the slight nuances of Taiwanese cooking really shows through at Rose Tea.",

    "text": "CMU students know to come here for closer-to-authentic-than-other-Pittsburgh-restaurants Taiwanese food. My favorite dish is the Taiwanese chunk chicken (\"san bei ji\" or three cups chicken literally for the recipe that is used to make the sauce).  My parents, who are from Taiwan, like this place.  The service is not always great... it's leaning on the practical side. Don't be surprised if you get asked to leave because you're lounging around for too long after finishing your meal. Although it seems it has been getting better lately. They are nicer to people they are familiar with.  There is a wide selection of bubble teas, etc. My favorite is the yogurt smoothie. The yogurt is of the Asian Yakult yogurt drink variety and not the creamy yogurt you may imagine.  They have some standard specials, which are kind of like fast food. One of these is a fried chicken and rice plate. This is a safe thing to get if you have never tried Taiwanese food.",

From tasting other people's food, I can also say that the chunk chicken is awesome (overpoweringly gingery and garlicky, but good), and the appetizer of Taiwanese sausage with sliced garlic is greasy but delicious.  The Taiwanese sausage fried rice is good too.  Still, I'll never give up that mixture of savory pork, vinegary greens, perfectly cooked rice and egg, and I'm not usually a menu-rut kind of person.",

There are others which seem more authentic and popular with people who are Chinese (e.g., Tasty restaurant on S. Highland), and others yet which are super upscale (Richard Chen's in Eastside --also off of S. Highland).   This place has a great chicken with green chili peppers and a number of other dishes.  The bubble teas are also wonderful.   A couple of dishes are kind of goofy, like a chinese version of chicken fried chicken steak.  I am not sure if this is actually a modified authentic recipe or a pander to American palates in the worst possible way.  In any case the chili chicken makes up for most transgressions.",
