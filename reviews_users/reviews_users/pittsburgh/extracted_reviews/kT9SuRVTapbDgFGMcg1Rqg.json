    "text": "Just okay.  I went here on a date but don't eat meat so I didn't order any of the burgers that people talk about.  My date seemed to like hers but said it came out way too hot and that was all she said about it.  I, instead, went for the French onion soup and Cesar salad.  I thought it was a pretty safe vegetarian choice and I love both of those dishes when they're done right.  My soup came out first and it was an oily, soggy, lukewarm mess. The first thing I noticed was the literal quarter inch layer of pure oil just sitting on top of the soup. After I pushed some of that off with my spoon I could get to the actual soup but was disappointed with what I got.  The soup it self wasn't hot enough and the cheese solidified more than it should have because of this.  On the underside of the cheese were two huge pieces of bread that appeared as if they had been sitting in liquid for the past day or two.  Added with onion slices which were too long to fit on my spoon and I was finished pretty quickly with that.  The Cesar salad I thought surely couldn't be bad, but again, I was left a little disappointed and a lot hungry.  Presentation was off and it just came out looking sad and wilted.  It was drenched with dressing with a strange sprinkling of some sort of cheese that just didn't seem to work.  Paired with lettuce leaves too big to fit in my mouth, I again parted ways with my food much more quickly than I would have liked.  All in all, I left feeling un-enthused, a little greasy, and, again, a lot hungry.  At least my date was cute.",

Just like NYC one of the biggest dilemas in Pittsburgh is deciding where to eat because there are so many good looking places.   Save yourself some time and arguing by taking my advice and come to the Murray Avenue Grill. The fish here is excellent, they use freshwater Atlantic Cod and give you a really big helping. Our waitress was extremely friendly and the dining atmosphere was nice. If I return to Pittsburgh which I hope to do because the city is absolutely amazing , I'll definetely be eating here",

I went in November, so I don't remember details about service and atmosphere, but the one thing I remember vividly was how NOT good the burgers were.  First, they switched mine and my mom's - I like mine rarer than Mom, so since the waitress mixed them up, I was chewing on her more well-done (and subsequently dry) burger until we figured out there'd been a switch.  But even her burger, supposedly medium rare, couldn't save the overall taste. The patties seemed to be nothing more than ground beef - flavorless, no hint of spices or anything.  And dry, not nearly juicy enough.    It's a shame, because we live so nearby and could easily go here often if it was any good.  The specials on the chalkboard outside always sound enticing, but I just shake my head and think it isn't worth trying.  It's probably worse than it sounds.",

While I appreciate that there is anything vegetarian to eat at these kinds of places (especially when I don't have a choice in going), grilled cheese gets boring fast. They have that, but it is completely forgettable and the only other items I saw that were in fair play were plain salads and fried thingies (zucchini, mozzarella, fries, sweet potato fries, etc.). This is Squirrel HIll in Pittsburgh, not back-woods West Virginia. I would like to think they could muster up even something as pitiful as a veggie burger from frozen, but no such luck.  Most recently I went here during a work lunch with a vendor and the service wasn't the best. Our waiter forgot my drink, forgot sauce for my food, forgot that the girl I was with asked for napkins. Perhaps forgivable things, but that plus a vibe not caring put me off. If you are on a tight lunch schedule, this may not be the place to go. Things came out pretty quickly, but I'm not sure you could be in and out in 30 minutes or less. This restaurant is pretty small and I would definitely not suggest trying to fit a group over 5 people in for a meal.  Now, after saying this, I'd like to add a little asterisk: this place probably isn't that bad for non-vegetarians. The food looks good and my work-mate who eats meat loves a few of their dishes. This is one of those reviews that is definitely for vegetarian-eyes-especially.",

It was a Friday night and they said the wait was about 15-20 minutes, but surprisingly we got seated in about 5 minutes.  I liked the atmosphere. It's more restaurant then bar. It has a bar and there are people of all ages are there drinking but it's not the college-kids-getting-smashed-and-ripping-the-urinals-off-the-walls kind of place either.  We were really hungry so we went with an app to split; the BBQ chicken flatbread. It's a flatbread topped with chicken, red onions, mozzarella cheese and BBQ sauce. I thought it was pretty good. As good as something with red onions can be at least.  Outside on the specials board they had some interesting options, one of which was a seafood ravioli that Todd ended up getting and he loved! After perusing the menu for about 15 minutes I finally decided on a fish sandwich. Don't ask me why....They have dozens of delicious looking options and I picked a fish sandwich???? It was okay, but I feel like I totally dropped the ball. I got overwhelmed and couldn't pick a decent menu option. The BF got a brisket sandwich or something that I got to taste. It was excellent, as it should be when described on the menu as \"Best Smoked Brisket Around!\" Our waiter was polite and attentive. Even giving a butler-type bow and hand flourish at one point, which I thought was hysterical. We will definitely be back and I am totally going to up my ordering game next time.",

The red pepper sauce or whatever it was (I can't quite remember) was really perfect for the salmon. I got a side of asparagus...which was limp and not very fresh. Sad because I love asparagus. But that's ok.  My friend got the beef brisket because I basically forced him. The beef brisket here really is one of the BEST sandwiches I've ever had. It is so freaking good. So big.

(I am from the Midwest and deplore the East Coast's way of overcooking meat.)  Their specials are also consistently good - well seasoned and well balanced.  Prices are very fair and serving sizes are generous.  My only complaint is that they are often playing loud pop music so that the inside of the restaurant sounds like a middle school dance.

It has chopped romaine lettuce dried cranberries, feta, pistachios and tomatoes. I order it with chicken, which you can have grilled or blackened. I actually have them put some of their BBQ sauce on it because it's great. They give you a huge breast of chicken. By the time you get down to the bottom of the salad, you've still got like an entire handful of pistachios, a cup of cranberries, and another an ounce of feta. Let's just say the portions are very generous.  My husband loves the steak and the burgers. The fries are delicious. Before giving up the gluten (tear), I used to love the jumbo florentine raviolis. They're like the size of the palm of your hand. So good. Basically, we've never had a bad meal there.  Also, they have kids meals! The kids meals come with a \"treat\". Spoiler: it's a Rice Krispie Treat.  The staff is friendly, the service is fast, and the kitchen is happy to customize your order.  Full bar. We usually order the reasonably-priced wines and beers, but it's nice to have the option. They even have TWO Happy Hours: 5pm-6pm AND 10pm-11pm! I love that the first one is at a normal time. Yes, I understand that a Happy Hour that starts at 2pm or 4pm is good for YOU, but it's worthless to ME.  Finally, the check comes with Tootsie Rolls. Now that's just good business!",

One thing to keep in mind: If you order steak, they tend to cook their meat a little bit more on the rare side.",

For an appetizer we had the fried pickles with a chipotle aioli that were crispy and tasty, and went perfectly with the sauce. Lunch entrees were a Rueben, the cheese burger of the day cooked to medium rare perfection, and what has to be the best smoked roast beef sandwich I've ever had. The fries were very good, thinner cut and crispy, left for you to season, which I prefer. Lots of crunchy little pieces, so yummy. My husband had the chicken Caesars and was not at all impressed. But the rest of us loved our selections. I would come back.",

Nothing at all about this meal was particularly memorable- nothing stood out as really terrible and deserving of being called out, but nothing at all was special.  The salad was just a salad and the service was okay but again, not memorable.  Murray Ave. Grill isn't someplace that I'd suggest to return to because honestly?  I wouldn't remember it even existed.",

Also, I see what's up w/ your fry situation and might I suggest going back to the ORIGINAL LARGE PORTION.   I say all of this out of love. Mark is a fantastic GM, the entire staff is on point 100% of the time, and the food is legit out of this world. This is my favorite place in the damn city,   but not anymore.   Not until you fix the burg situation and start giving me more than 10 fries again.   People don't forget! (Yes, that's a Superbad reference)  However much you are saving, money-wise, you are losing 3x as much respect/word of mouth wise.   That being said, it's so good that I'm still ordering delivery tonight from you guys,  because it's the best.  Maybe we can get some sort of supersize option goin' on?  But if you even think of charging me extra, no deal.   Sincerely,  EVERYONE.",

I finished it all. It was a bit spicy and was delicious. I did eye a woman eating the ribs and they looked great. Her plate was empty when I looked back again. Clearly she liked her meal.   What I love about this area of Pittsburgh is the choices. And so far I've yet to be disappointed in where I've gone.

However were not allowed to be seated until our one guest arrived. I thought that was silly considering that this was not a very fancy place. Any who. As we waited for our one guest to show up, we sat at the bar and had a drink. The bar is clean, they have a good number of tables around it, in the front and back of the restaurant for how small it was.    The table setting is cute when they seat you and the wait staff was very attentive. The burgers can be substituted for a veggie/bean patty or chicken. The burger i had chosen was with a substituted with the bean patty, topped with feta cheese, their Tzatziki sauce and sliced cucumbers on a baked Kaiser roll. I had ordered my side to come as their sweet potato fries. It was very tasty.    They have a wide variety of menu options, Salads, entrees, soups, burgers/ sandwiches and wraps. They also have a great variety of dessert options as well. I will definitely keep this place in mind when in this area again.",

    "text": "I've always passed Murray Avenue Grill, but never decided here for dinner for some reason. So, when it was my decision to pick a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day, I decided on MAG since none of us have tried it. They did not take reservations but the girl on the phone informed me that the wait wasn't too bad, but I could also call when on my way (i forgot! lol)   We walked in and were told that it'd be a half hour wait for our party of 4. It actually only took 2 minutes because someone left right afterwards. The host was super friendly! Wow, that guy needs to take his friendliness to the next level (serving!)   MAG offered the regular menu as well as a Valentine's Day menu (score!) The V-day menu consisted of entrees of steak w. crabmeat & asparagus, lobster, steak & lobster, ribs or burger & fries. Bobby and I each decided on the steak & lobster.   I know many have already explained, but MAG has GREAT steak! I almost asked the server for steak sauce until I tasted how juicy & flavorful the steak was! The lobster was even better. We've had lobster at another restaurant, but MAG's was flawless (in fact, a man at the table across from us stopped over to ask how good the lobster was) I ordered the steamed veggies as a side &  Bobby had the asparagus- which by the way he said was the 2nd best asparagus he's had. (Don't worry, I informed him it's a little weird to have a top 5 asparagus list) Our friends ordered the rib entree & another ordered the burger & fries. All looked delish and everyone said it was a good decision to come here! For dessert, my friend & I split the chocolate cake. Do yourself a favor and choose that as your dessert. It literally knocked our socks off!   So our v-day dinner was great. The only awkward part was the server. She seemed on the debbie-downer side, which flipping lasted our entire meal. When we asked what was wrong, she said that it was a slow night, partly because no regulars we there. Server Etiquette 101: dont inform new patrons at your restaurant that you miss your regulars.. especially on Valentine's Day when we're about to have a $150 table bill. Part of me wished the happy-go-lucky host could've been promoted at that moment to our server. The food made up for it though!   I'm excited to head back here in the Spring to enjoy the outdoor seating.",

I sent it back and it came out with cheese melted in top and still completely RARE inside! What?? The waitress and the manager apologized and gave us a free dessert so we decided to try again.   Last week, on my bday, I went to a movie at The Manor then met my hubby for dinner at the Grill to eat dinner and watch the Penguins. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich, which is advertised as the Best Brisket. It tasted pretty good but not The Best. I got the most awful food poisoning later that night. Vomiting, chills, sweats and all of the other grossness you can think of. I missed work the next day and couldn't get out of bed until about 4pm. Happy bday to me?  So no more Murray Ave Grill for us. It's too unpredictable and I don't want to end up in the hospital.",

When you walk in you will notice that the place has an odd shape and setup with the bar on the left and the dining tables in old fashioned booths cramped in a very dimly lit back area with a view of the kitchen that has no door. The official photos seem to purposefully obscure this setup.   Secondly, our particular male waiter was inattentive and noticeably unfriendly. I saw another table with a nice waitress who had much better service. So perhaps the guy we had just needs fired. I mean, even the busboy, who noticed our drinks and water were empty, was much more cordial.  Now on to the food, but first, if you want to know how NOT to design a menu, then come to this place. It's absolutely all over the place and strangely difficult to read. More importantly the food was poor, and the main dishes were overpriced. I've never been to a restaurant where the \"House Favorites\" were the worst dishes. Despite taking almost 30 minutes to come out, The New York Strip Steak was extremely bland and undercooked. It tasted like they threw a frozen steak in the oven. My 2 sides were equally as bad. The grilled asparagus was soggy and probably the worst I've ever had a restaurant. The pasta and sauce was even worse. There was barely any sauce, and I've tasted better from Ragu and Prego.  I wanted to like this place, but I can't at all. Perhaps it is suitable for drinks by the window on a nice day. Otherwise, avoid it.",

One asked the other two if they had ever 'child molested a cat' and then went on to ask why child molesters are so vilified!  First and foremost - abhorrent ignorance is alive and well.  Secondly, awareness of your surroundings while conversing at work is obviously not a requirement to work at the Murray Avenue Grill.  As I left I told the bartender I had hoped I misunderstood their conversation and was told 'that's why we call him a freak'.  NEVER going back and recommend the same for all.  Management must hold employees accountable for their actions AND words in front of customers.",

It was chicken with buffalo sauce, lettuce, and cheese in a wrap. Basic but tasty. I had a salad that had grilled chicken, black beans, corn, roasted red peppers and tortilla strips. Again, basic but tasty. The best part of the meal was dessert. We had the apple dumpling with cinnamon ice cream. Yum!  We were sharing it and we devoured it quickly!",

The turkey burger wasn't made from ground meat, which I didn't appreciate. It was more like the patties you buy frozen and throw on the grill. But it still tasted good along with the fried pickles, cheddar, and chipotle mayo that made up the sandwich.    Ultimately, it's a comfortable environment with two or three TVs. So you can watch the game or just have a nice meal with friends. The menu is interesting. I wouldn't mind going back to try a few others options.",

    "text": "We had great service and our food came out promptly. The lamb burger was great tasting and the portion size of the French fries bordered on absurd.   I would suggest steering clear of the smoked brisket. The meat lack any smoke flavoring and was tough and chewy. Not what you want in a sandwich.   From my seat I had a clear view of a prep area of the kitchen. I do not like to see non-restaurant personnel entering and exiting the kitchen as if a party is happening back there while my food is being prepped. Also, I know we all have to eat to survive, but I don't want to see people eating in the kitchen when I can't also see them washing their hands afterward.   Over all this is a good place to stop for a bite to eat, however, just keep in mind every menu item isn't a hit. Murray Ave Grill clearly aspires to be a good restaurant, but they're just not there and can work to improve.   Despite my criticisms I would still give it another try.",

The space is long and narrow with a bar to the left right when you walk in. Murray Avenue Grill is not what I would call fancy; it's more so a traditional bar and grill, but the booths also reminded me of a family restaurant. They serve traditional American items like burgers, wraps, salads, etc. In terms of taste, flavors were okay. Our party of three ordered fish tacos, a hamburger and a veggie burger. I can only speak on the fish tacos which were rather bland and ordinary.   Although the food was ok, the service was on point. The gentleman taking care of us was very attentive and friendly when we had questions. Food also came out very quickly and we were in and out.  Overall, dinner wasn't all that special and I may or may not come back. With all the other options in this area, it's hard to choose this spot over the others.",

    "text": "I visited Murray Ave. Grill with three friends for brunch last Sun.  Given that I'm always a fan of a good brunch and that I'd heard favorable reviews of theirs, I suggested that we try it out, and my friends humored me, given that it was my last outing in PGH with some of them.  For my entree, I ordered the goat cheese scramble ($9.95), which contained asparagus and sun dried tomato in addition to goat cheese and eggs.  While the portion was a bit on the small side, I found it filling as well as very flavorful, and they certainly didn't skimp on my favorite ingredient--goat cheese!  It also came with a latke and an English muffin on the side, so altogether, the portion size actually wasn't bad.  I requested sour cream for the latke, which was brought at no extra cost, and the latke itself was crispy and fluffy.  Two of my friends ordered the hobo hash ($9.95), which consists of Yukon gold potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, and diced potatoes.  Although they agreed with me that the portion was on the smaller size, they also found it filling and enjoyed it very much.  My other friend ordered the lamb burger with sweet potato fries ($10.95).  She said the lamb was very well-cooked, and she thought the fries complemented it well.  Given that this was my last brunch in PGH and that I'd never had a full Bloody Mary before, I decided to splurge and get one ($5).  While I don't have a standard of taste to go by, I can say that it wasn't nearly as large or elaborate as some of the other Bloodies offered at various other brunch places around town.  Trying this drink confirmed my suspicion that Bloodies aren't my preferred brunch drink of choice (I'm more into mimosas and bellinis), but at least I can say I've actually had one now!  The restaurant's interior isn't very distinctive--it's basically a bar with some dining tables.  However, service was very friendly and accommodating, which we appreciated.  The clientele is a bit on the geriatric side--at the time of our visit, almost all of the other customers had gray hair and/or facial wrinkles.  Nevertheless, if you enjoy savory brunch items, Murray Ave. Grill offers a nice alternative to Pamela's, similar to Nu Jewish Bistro in many respects. If you're in Squirrel Hill and are looking for brunch options, it's certainly worth a try!",

The menu is standard bar/grille fare, at a reasonable price, so we thought it would be a reliable place to take an out of town visitor.  I had a salad, which was solidly fine.  But two of three in our party had burgers, which was where the problem occurred.  While we were waiting, the table next to us complained that their burgers had been undercooked.  Maybe this led the kitchen staff to crank up the grill, but both of my companions' burgers arrived completely over-done.  The medium burger arrived well-done but with a crispy exterior, and the medium-well burger arrived completely black.    After trying to suck it up and eat them, we asked for the medium-well burger to be redone.  Almost immediately, our companion reconsidered since too much time had elapsed, and she had eaten too much of a gross burnt burger.  It took a while to flag down someone from the wait staff, and when we did, our waitress, Joy, seemed actively irritated.  And being polite, our companion agreed to wait for a burger she didn't want, and didn't end up eating.    We never received an apology from any waitstaff or our waitress, and we were charged full price for the burger.   I don't think we'll be coming back, as there are so many good food options in Squirrel Hill.",

The table next to us was a group of obnoxious teenagers, which I suppose is to be expected given the neighborhood. Our waitress was friendly but seemed almost intimidated by the older gentleman (owner? manager?) floating around behind her, and repeatedly apologized for things like carding us saying she'd lose her job if she didn't. She took our orders, and the food and drinks arrived within fifteen minutes easily.  I had a burger with gouda cheese, and Kyle had something similar. We both went with regular fries as a side. The fries were good, but a tad stringy and greasy in a dark way for my taste...almost as if the fry oil was old. The burger was tasty, but the whole thing fell apart before I was halfway through. I think the integrity of the bun had something to do with it. The gouda cheese was also sliced very thickly and not melted. That's a personal quibble, but I like to see small details like that done right. Overall I might come back here if I was in Squirrel Hill late at night and craving something very specific, but it didn't wow me. If a place has amazing food and service it won't matter if it's my scene, but nothing was great enough to balance out the super conservative atmosphere and teenage clientele.",

    "text": "Good service and good food! Burgers here are very tasty but on this night I wanted something different.  I decided on their chicken scalloppini...which was grilled chicken over penne with oven roasted tomatoes, capers and artichokes in a butter garlic sauce with some parm on top. I'm glad most of the sauce collected at the bottom so it wasn't greasy. It was seasoned well but not too salty. The capers set the dish off and it was very yummy. The entree came with a salad and a roll too. My dinner date had the spicy chicken wrap which was also very good. I had a malibu punch which took me to the tropics for a moment at least. Our waitress was very kind and attentive.  I've always liked the atmosphere here and the service. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their menu.",

    "text": "A neighborhood gem that's for sure. They have a variety of menu choices. We try to experiment and not stay with any one dish. But, I must say, I love the fried pickles! Their salads and dressing are terrific and another staple is the chicken fingers. Burgers are high on the list and they rotate a special burger each day. Worth trying all of them. We once had a hotdog/hamburger-interesting, you might say. Well, also awesome!! It was so good-like a picnic on a bun! They usually have a wait if you go at peak hours. They also have a few outdoor tables that fill up quickly. They do not take reservations and you can't call ahead. So plan accordingly. They have a bar with seating where you can get food as well. I did not like the lamb burger-it has too many spices that take away from the lamb taste. Would love it to be more plan. Also, the rolls with the salads are not very good. But, who cares! Don't eat the roll!!  The space is an odd shape that might limit table capacity, but can't really think of another floor plan. But, it all works. They stay busy and their food is fresh.  The staff is great-always happy and timely. Will be back for the 98th time very soon!!!:-)",

My friend and I had been hoping to go to Pamela's, but when the wait was two hours, we decided to try here out.  There was no wait on a Sunday morning around 10:30.  I've yet to try Pamela's, but I don't think I'll ever make it there since this is right across the street!  How do you start brunch on your birthday?  With a birthday mimosa, of course!  The mimosa was delicious and not terribly priced.  From there I moved to a massive breakfast burrito, covered in tomatoes.  I couldn't quite finish the whole thing, but I took it to go and ate it later.  I definitely would order it again.  My friend ordered steak and eggs, and the steaks were a really nice size for the price.  The wait staff was friendly, and I cannot wait to come back here to try out the lunch and dinner menus!",

I got the brisket sandwich and my wife go the crab cake sandwich which were both amazingly delicious.

The food is good, but nothing really stands out about it. It is your typical America fare bar food that comes with a side of fries (maybe the best food they have). I generally just get a wrap or a burger.   They do have a full bar, but I wish they had more beers on tap. They do have a solid bottle selection, but I prefer drafts and they only have six, with only 2-3 crafts.   The service is nice and the ambiance is casual. The place is a bit cramped at times, but is good for groups of 2-4. You can find parking nearby usually without too much trouble. The price point here is about right, no qualms there.

The bun was nice but would be better toasted or heated in some way. The fries were plentiful and very thin, small and crisp: my favorite style.

It is my understanding that they have been around for a pretty long time. I consider them a hidden gem because they have extremely good food at a completely reasonable price. My favorite dish is the caprese flat bread. They also have a to-die-for lamb burger. It is so popular, I heard that the employees aren't allowed to order them because they usually run out. Their beer selection could be better but I always seem to find something good to drink. Lastly, if I get dessert it is always the Prantl's almond torte cake.   This is my go to place to watch the Penguins. They have multiple TVs in their front section; however, their bar fills up fast because it is small. They also have a more intimate dining section in the back which is good for dates. I highly suggest stopping by here. I personally am trying to become a regular.",

The salmon salad was right sized and included fresh avocado slices and plenty of red roasted peppers, included a roll and balsamic vinegarette. The smoke brisket sandwich was AWESOME! Great job reason for 5 stars. I was surprised how much brisket was on it. The bread was toasted and had coleslaw on it the slaw was superb. At every first time visit at a restaurant with brisket i order that, this ranks at the top! Great job! sweet potato fries were crispy and excellent  Topped off with almond torte which was real good great stuff there was nothing bad about this place staff was friendly and very attentive good atmosphere and cozy  will be back for brisket samich :) It had good smoke flavor too!!",

I had two of the specials for dinner including the spicy red bean chili with sirloin for my side and then had a Gourmet Burger Topped with Pepper Jack Cheese, Canadian Bacon and a Fried Egg on a Fresh Baked Brioche Bun.  The chili was outstanding. Wasn't too spicy at all and had wonderful flavors! Would easily get this in again with out question!   The burger was very tasty too. It was cooked to perfection and was seasoned properly. The burger itself bonded really well with all the condiments. Overall, it was a very tasty burger and only complaint I had on it is that the burger patty was smaller than the bun that it came on. It got annoying at the end because there were many bites with more bread in my mouth then patty.   Overall, I enjoyed my dinner at Murray Avenue Grill and for someone that is here on vacation I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would give it a 4.2/5 on the whole meal itself.",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch before going to a Purim party at the Jewish Community Center. I arrived shortly after it opened and was seated right away. My waitress was very friendly and helpful in describing the menu options.  Today they were featuring Sunday brunch and they had other items listed as specials on the menu for that reason. I was originally going to get the Reuben with potato pancakes and a side of two eggs but when she told me it was quite large I decided on something smaller. I ended up ordering a hamburger with portabello mushrooms, lettuce, and tomato. It comes with your choice of side of French fries, coleslaw, or potato salad. If you want sweet potato fries then you will pay a slight upcharge for them.  I got my food fairly quickly and was glad it wasn't too large since I was planning on getting a dessert at the Purim party. Both the burger and coleslaw were good. It was prepared to my request. Nothing outstanding about it but still made for a decent lunch. I happened to notice someone who had ordered a spicy chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and he told me it was indeed worthwhile.   I saw on the menu that they have Prantl's burnt almond torte as one of their desserts. Good to know for a future visit.   Definitely would recommend coming on a Sunday since you get free parking at those meters and would like to try their brunch on a future visit.",

Spicy Sunday Bloody Mary had texture, was full-flavored. Staff had good attitudes, knowledgeable, food was quick, place is cute. If I lived here this would be on my short list of mainstays.

    "text": "I used to come here at least once a month for dinner.  Never been here for lunch so i am not going to comment on that.     Foodwise, they used to have a special menu everyday and there is where I order from. It rotates every 2 weeks, so back ribs were every other thursday.  Their steaks are really good, and i want to say it is better than their fish most of the time.  \"Chef's special\" comes with 2 sides (grilled asparagus x2 for me).  Or you can change 1 side to soup for $2(?).  My wife loves their mushroom bisque, and I like their French onion soup.    Super busy on Friday, weekdays certainly have better food, better service.   4*, but not 5*, for two reasons.  1) one out of ten there is a slight disappointment.  Maybe food wasn't good enough, it was too busy... something like that. 2) The food on special menu is good, but you never know if they are in \"today\". I had a steak here once that was very good, but i never find out what it was.  I had a photo of it, and i brought it back and asked the staff, they cannot tell me what it was because it was from the special menu.  ANd because of this special daily menu, I used to go to their website twice a week just to see what's up.  by the way, they have a new website.  Much better looking, but no special menu section.  Either they are still updating the website, or they are changing something.  by the way (x2), they might be the only American food / grill in the Squirrel Hill.  Yes.... we definitely have more Chinese restaurants in Squirrel Hill than American grill.  Please message me if you can name another one.",

However my last visit 10 days ago was a horrible experience. While into my second bite of my side salad there was a live bug in it. We quietly told the waitress who only offered to bring me another one.  Fearing more contaminated lettuce I opted for fries.  The Manager came over & said he'd give us new salads. We asked how he can insure the lettuce is safe he just said you'll get new lettuce.  My big issue is neither waitress nor Manager ever apologized for this incident.  When the bill came i asked waitress what adjustment she made & she said i took off ur $2 side salad that u sent back.  I wasn't looking for something free I just felt manager could have handled better by at least apologizing.  Us long time customers will not be going back !",

Both were decent. The lobster bisque could have used some chunks in it (though I understand that I'm not in a place near water- so overall, pretty good but nothing to go crazy about.) The French onion soup was also fine, though nothing mind blowing.  I ordered the salmon burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I did enjoy the sweet potato fries, just enough seasoning; though I feel the salmon burger needed the help of the aioli it came with to help spruce up the taste.  The steak sandwich was my friends choice. I did have a bite and it was flavorful, just nothing memorable. Their side of potato salad was bomb though! I'd definitely recommend the potato salad as a side.",

Many a local go there weekdays and weekends, and usually recognized by the staff.  Servers are extremely friendly and well-seasoned (most having been there for over a year) and will go out of their way to accommodate special requests.    The menu offers a variety of dishes, so everyone can pretty much find something they like.  As far as salads, I would recommend the West Coast Chicken, with cranberries, pistachios and gorgonzola paired with the Raspberry vinaigrette.  (UPDATE:  with the recent pistachio recall, I might avoid for the time being)  For sandwich eaters, I would suggest the bar-b-que beef or their \"made to order\" burgers.  I've tried a few of their entrees in the past and would suggest any daily fish special.  Don't bother ordering pasta.  They seem pretty lack-luster and can pretty much make the exact same dish at home.",

The fish tacos I ordered once were overcooked and lacking in flavor too.   I am not too demanding since this place is a casual bar / restaurant, but the prices are too high for the quality of the food.  The cole slaw that accompanied my last dinner was comparable to KFC's.  Yet, the amenable bartenders and the overall good service make it more a 2 star than a 1 star place.   For a snack--the fries are ok--and a drink, it's not too bad.  Just remember that when you order the higher alcohol content draft beers you will not get your typical pint, they serve you in smaller glasses.  Strange and not cool.",

And there's just nothing exciting on the menu at all.  Appetizers are generally good, but expensive for what you get.  I would allow myself to be dragged here without protesting, but I wouldn't choose to go.",

Everyone has that on their menu. Difference is, MAG has the best French Onion soup and cheeseburger around.    I had been wanting to try this place out for a while and one day I finally did.  I was starving when I arrived which made looking at the menu very difficult because they have so many excellent items to choose from that I couldn't decide.  I was craving French Onion soup so I went with that and paired it with a cheeseburger, but I could have easily gotten any number of things from the menu.  Their apps are great, their flatbreads are great, their soups are great but their entrees are where its at.  Crab cakes, filet mignon, pork chops, ahi tuna - if it can be grilled, MAG knows how to do it right.  This is one of my favorites restaurants in Pittsburgh.    ps They have a bunch of salads, a veggie wrap and pastas for the non meat-eaters.",

The clientele ranges from very young to very old.  They play 50's music, but not too loud.  The food is very good with a good range of entrees.  They have a full bar.  With your bill at the end of the meal you get two small Tootsie rolls.  How unique is that?  I love this place and will definitely visit again when visiting Pittsburgh.  I've eaten there over a dozen times and the food and service are consistently very good. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, but I've never had to wait for more than 20 minutes to be seated.  Also, there may be open seats at the bar while waiting, or you can eat at the bar.",

We hit Ten Thousand Villages and a couple of other places.  We hit the Murray Avenue Grill for Sunday Brunch.  Lemme say this:  M.A.G.'s brunch goes beyond your typical eggs, pancakes, and waffles.  Now I played it a little safer, ordering the ahi tuna salad, with grilled tomatoes and mixed veggies.  I did try the pepper parmesan dressing.  Here's a hint if you want dressing on your salad and you want to save calories.  Don't put your dressing on the salad, but rather dip the prongs of your fork in it.  You'll still get the same flavor!  Cindy tried something adventurous--the breakfast rueben..  This concoction is corned beef, Swiss, kraut, & 1000 island dressing between two potato pancakes.  Oh yes, with 2 eggs on the side!",

I was astounded that the manager enforced this rule even though the restaurant was slow, there were no lines, my husband was already working, and I was prepared to order for us both. I felt unvalued as a customer--and one who always tips generously (30%). I have friends who have complained about the host or hostess, but I never had similar experiences until last night. So we'll be dining elsewhere now, and that's sad because we like to frequent non-chain restaurants like this one.",
