We spent just under $40 and got a ton of food- a tofu salad, the lamb meatball/rice/masala bowl, samosas, roasted veggie side, and two mango lassis for a toddler and two adults. We'll definitely be back! (You can park in the garage if your under 45 minutes- we were over and total was $3). It's BYOB! I forgot my wine but next time, definitely.  Wait for food was really short, service was friendly. Very clean.",

    "text": "I've been to Choolaah twice now. I want to love this place because the format reminds me of my favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin - Tarka. Unfortunately, I've been kind of disappointed in the food and dining experience. Both times I went, it was totally packed inside. Sure, it is new, and people are excited to try it. The space is vast - well, the vertical space is. Seating space, however, is pretty limited and cramped. Some parts are right up against the windows and line, and there's little room for patrons to move around, get toppings, and employees to bus the tables. It is also quite loud. They play music that sounds like you're shopping at an H&M.  As for food - it isn't bad. But also, it really lacks that punch of flavor that I've come to expect and appreciate from Indian food. It really tastes like they dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette, and I'm not very happy about that. They don't offer any spice level when you order - but do have some hot sauces in the condiments area. Unfortunately, those just aren't the right flavor profile - they taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum, and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. It's just not the same.  Mango lassi is delicious. Samosa chaat is also quite good.  I wish they didn't use so many disposable plates, cups, plasticware. Another negative compared to Tarka.  All in all, I think this place is a fine quick alternative to, say, Chipotle, but if you really want quality and interesting flavors - look to one of the old-school restaurants like People's Indian, Tamarind, or All India. In reality, I can get in and out of People's Indian just as fast as here.",

Their is an abundance of cool wall art and homages to India. I ended up getting the lamb meatball choolaah bowl with tikka masala and a mango lassi. The mango lassi was lacking a bit of sugar for my taste. We were given a buzzer and the food came out pretty quickly. They had a variety of sauces at the counter, chopped red onion, and chilli peppers. The lamb meatballs were delicious. They were juicy, flavorful, and well seasoned. I was thrilled as they reminded me of my mother's lamb koftas. The variety of vegetables were a nice addition and the tikka masala was good too on the rice. My friend had the chicken and loved it as well. Overall, an excellent addition to the growing pittsburgh food scene. A very well thought out and aesthetically pleasing establishment.",

The parking in east Liberty really sucks , BUT THEY HAVE 45 MIN FREE PARKING in the back for the building. after that its only 3 bucks. Food was outstanding. Loved the Lamb meatballs. OHHH The Lava Sauce !!!! You place your order at the register and pay.They \"Page\" you when your order is ready , and you go pick it up and enjoy. They have a second floor for extra seating.

I absolutely love Indian food, especially any nice rich, thick, spicy curry dish, but of course wouldn't expect that here since that takes time to make.  Bf got the lamb meatballs choolaah bowl and I got the salmon choolaah bowl, each with rice + greens, tikka masala sauce, and naan. The portions were reasonable for the price and quality (comparable to Panera, Chipotle, etc). The meats were tasty. The tikka masala isn't like the creamy, thick sauce you'd get at an Indian restaurant, but is more like a tomato sauce flavored with Indian spices. Still delicious. The naan had garlic, onion, and salt on it and was soft and chewy - yum.  We also got a side of samosas each. These weren't bad - the potato-pea filling was very ordinary and didn't have much going on in the spice department. The filling to dough ratio was definitely dough heavy also. But for \"fast food\" samosas, it's what I would've expected.  For condiments, we tried the mint chutney, mango, and regular hot sauce.  They were all pretty tasty.  We ordered online for pick up - it was a pretty smooth process. Cost for two people to be fairly full + tax came out to about $33. Will definitely go back.",

I work nearby, so I've been here many times (and anticipate coming here many more), so here's what I've noticed so far:  -The perfect balance bowl is perfect for people like me who want variety. Absolutely love it with paneer, and the veggie croquettes are good but you'll need to put sauce from the sauce bar on them (they're a bit dry). I definitely want to try the salmon next time.  -The wraps are on the smaller side. If you are hungry, definitely get more than a wrap.  -Try the naan and samosas as extras! If you get the samosas, be sure to get the tamarind apple sauce.  -The sauces are great! If you're like one of the reviewers below who felt that there wasn't enough heat, get the lava sauce -- it packs a punch. I actually like that the food is well-seasoned but not super spicy, since this allows me to go there with friends of mine who might not be able to handle spice.  -It's not that cheap as far as Indian food goes, but I assume from the lack of tipping that the employees are getting paid fairly, and they also tell you where they source their ingredients from!   An anecdote about the service -- I was given the wrong buzzer today, so of course it never went off. After waiting for a pretty long time in Choolah time (maybe fifteen minutes -- the food is usually ready in five or less), I went up to the counter and asked about my food. After realizing that they had given me the wrong buzzer, they handed me the bowl but switched out my then-cold naan for a fresh one and also gave me free samosas!   The only issue that I might have is that they blast techno and clubby music. Not exactly what I want to listen to while I eat, but I'll bear it.",

I've been here many times and my favorite meal is the choolah salad with chicken. It's delicious and feels fairly healthy!   The lemonades are amazing and as a first time customer they offer to let you sample them. Their ice cream-ish dessert called Kulfi is also so tasty. The mango is my fave.

    "text": "It seems like the concept of Choolah has been pretty well covered in other reviews here -- it's the Chipotle of Indian food. We all know that by now, right? So on to the more important topic -- how is the food? I recently tried their veggie croquette tikka masala, samosas, and garlic naan (all take out). It was a bit of a mixed bag. First thing to note is that this isn't really authentic Indian food. I mean, they try, but the flavors are very muted compared to what you would get at a real-deal Indian restaurant. For example, the tikka masala didn't have the spice or warmth of traditional tikka masala...it was pretty bland, with the dominant flavor being almost tomato-soup-like. There are sauces available that you can use to doctor up your food (which help), but I think the masala itself could use a kick in the flavor pants. However, the veggie croquettes were pretty tasty. They're obviously different from the veggie balls that you'd get in, say, malai kofta, but they were delicious and an interesting departure from typical Indian fare. I also enjoyed the samosas...unlike the masala, these actually did have some spice and flavor. As for the naan, it was a letdown. I love naan that's fluffy, soft, and chewy, but this naan was thin and tough...maybe even a bit stale.   Choolah uses high quality ingredients (hooray for antibiotic-free chicken!), and the food isn't bad for what it is. If you're looking for a fast meal and a unique take on Indian food, this will get the job done. However, if given the choice, I'd probably head to an authentic Indian place over Choolah every time.",

The food was fantastic and the staff was delightful! It was fast and efficient. The restaurant was very clean. Yes, it is \"fast food\" but it didn't feel that way at all.

You can either select from their menu or create your own: think protein + bowl, salad, or wrap type deal. You cannot go wrong, trust me.   Please don't forget to try all of the sauces. ALL OF THEM ARE DELICIOUS. Just dip the equally amazing naan in the sauce. Bam.   Their ingredients are fresh and local. I've tried several of the apps and they've all been rather tasty, as well.

    "text": "This concept is just so cool. The best way to describe Choolaah to those who may be unfamiliar is \"Chipotle, but for Indian food.\" While this is not a perfect comparison, it paints a picture. You can create a bowl, a salad, a wrap, etc. They also have samosas and other options for nibbles.   On my very first visit, I ordered the Choolaah salad topped with veggies and tofu. The Choolaah salad was very impressive for a fast-casual restaurant concept. In addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, there were also golden raisins and picked onions on top. The addition of the veggies and tofu turned that salad into quite a lot of satisfying food. I would've loved some more greens to make it feel more like a salad, but honestly, complaining that a salad was too hearty is not really a complaint at all. I topped my salad with the Choolaah ranch, which packed the perfect amount of heat. However, there was a lot of flavor in that salad, so the dressing was barely necessary--just a nice bonus.  The samosas were yummy, but I have had better. I dipped them in the Choolaah Fire sauce for a delicious kick. Actually, one of my favorite parts about Choolaah was the available additions--a variety of sauces, chopped red onions, peppers, and lemon wedges were provided to add to any dish.  At the end of the day, you can get a delicious plate of food at Choolaah. The naan is bomb, the flavors are bold, and the concept is very strong overall. Try the black lentil masala for something a little different, and be sure to add that Choolaah Fire sauce to any and all things.",

The best part of this place is all the chutneys you can put on your food as well as red onion and green chilies. i feel the portions are just slightly too small - maybe I could eat 1 and 1/8 of a portion and feel full-- but the flavor makes up for it!",

We told him it was our first time in, he gave us the step by step direction and a taste of the different sauces and drinks. {I am sure they do that for everyone, but he made us feel special}  each of the marsalas and daals. Each one better than the previous!  We tried the two lemonades- again fantastic! You can taste how fresh they are!  We settled on our dinners. I did the Choolaah bowl with chicken, white basmati, and the yellow daal. With the naan  Amazingly flavorful but not overwhelming.  My husband ordered the Choolaah salad with Tofu.  The tofu was so flavorful, he enjoyed the salad esp the raisins and crispy naan.  We also ordered the Somosa Chaat, I wasn't in love with them- but my husband really liked them.  I wasn't in the mood for fried food.  Overall the whole experience was wonderful. The place was clean, bright, friendly, and welcoming.  There is a parking garage right next door which was a HUGE plus!   Can't wait to go back and try something new!",

    "text": "I decided to try Choolaah since I was in the area and the free 45 minute parking in the connected garage sold me. I needed something quick to go and you know how street parking can be nearly impossible in East Liberty.    At first, I was a little overwhelmed with choices, but I saw a patron with a really great looking dish and asked her what she had. Then I realized the ordering style is much like Chipotle. I stuck with something familiar so I did rice, chicken, and tikka masala. It was very good. The chicken was fantastic. I wished I had added vegetables, but as is, I was very happy with my choices. I tried the naan and admittedly, I had to eat it in the car on the way home! I loved the sprinkle of salt and nigella seeds on it! I don't usually get sweet drinks, but the vibrant color of the mango lemonade called to me. I could tell it must include mango puree because it wasn't possible to get the flavor and consistency without it. Oh my goodness. It is simply amazing! They even asked me IF I wanted ice instead of filling the whole cup with ice and shorting me the beverage like pretty much every other establishment does. Basically, splurge on the mango lemonade. It's the real deal.   I was very happy with my service, food, and the clean, open atmosphere. I was there after typical lunch rush hour, so it wasn't crowded, but I'd imagine given the setup that service moves quickly.   I absolutely love that they have quite a few chutney and sauce or condiments at a self serve station (complete with containers if you are getting food to go).   Also, kudos to using compostable bowls!",

I was already deep into my Friday night by the time I came in here so I was a little overwhelmed by the many choices on the menu. But it's actually pretty simple: to build your own bowl, choose a base (rice or salad), choose a masala, and choose a protein. I chose rice with tikka masala and the vegan croquettes. It was so delicious and the portions are HUGE!  Then, once you get your bowl, the fun part begins. You're free to pile on as many sauces and toppings as your heart desires from the DIY toppings bar. There are 8 different sauces and they're all fantastic! Be sure to try the mango sauce: it tasted like biting into a fresh mango!  A lot of people are complaining about lack of heat, but I can understand them not making the base curries too spicy so that they can appeal to everyone. If you want some heat, there are two different levels of spicy sauce. I put lots of \"Choolaah fire\" sauce and chopped jalapeno on my bowl, and it tasted perfect.  If you don't want to build your own bowl, the biryani and samosa chaat (samosas with sauces) both looked really good. The biryani is served like a pot pie with a layer of bread over it--never seen that before!  The space is very bright, clean, and cool. And though I'm no expert on authenticity, there were several Indian families eating here when I was here, so that's a good sign! Overall, Choolaah is a cool addition to the fast-casual landscape, and I would definitely return!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: if you are thinking of visiting them looking for traditional Indian food, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment. A lot of folks  go visit them thinking of it an an Indian food place but it is really an Indian/Mexican/Pakistani/American fusion with 80/5/5/10% contributions, respectively. If you are still interested, then continue reading this review.   First things first, I generally don't write a review when I am traveling but when I do, I am either amazed the food or absolutely disappointed by it. I like eating healthy food and I had been yelping healthy food in Pitt and this place popped up on my list. I thought to myself--this ain't right because Indian food is almost never healthy. It is delicious but never healthy. Turns out I was wrong. I visited this restaurant on a weekend and it wasn't busy at the time. Like others have mentioned, you pick your bowl/salad, add protein and then grab your drink. I ordered the salad and anointed paneer as my protein source( congrats, Paneer!). I also ordered the wheat nan (this is probably the only place that serves wheat naan in all of USA--what a blessing) along with the salad. I was abso-freaking-lutely blown away by the food. Paneer was nicely grilled. and I asked for the Choolaah ranch dressing. But wait, they also have the chutneys on tap. I mean, are you kidding me---I will just drink all that chutney if no one was watching. But jokes aside,they have the Mango chutney, the tamarind apple chutney, and the mint chutney. Do yourself a favor and grab as many as you want and the chutneys just make your salad even more delicious. I added the tamarind chutney and the mango chutney to to my salad and the taste was heavenly. Therefore, do yourself a favor and try the food. You won't be disappointed. And one last thing, the place is 5% Mexican because they follow the chipotle-like concept and 5%Pakistani because they serve halal meat and some of the spices that they used are common in Pakistani food, not so much in Indian.",

    "text": "Disappointing but not surprising. The food here should not be confused with what really comprises Indian food which is very varied and calls upon a number of ingredients, spices , and cooking techniques. This really is Americanized Indian fast food. When I ate there I did the choice of protein (lamb choola bowl with tikka masala) , rice, naan, and a mango lassi. I'd only go back for the mango lassi. Somehow they managed to muddle the flavors to the point that I couldn't quite tell what flavor profile they had intended other than fast food. The glory of Indian cooking is that even with the number of spices they use you can actually taste those individual spices whereas at Choolah they blend into blah. If the prices were much lower, I'd say OK a quick other than hamburger fast meal but when you pay for one entree what  you could pay for an entire Indian lunch buffet with better cooking, Choolah goes into the 'not worth it' column in my book.",

The sauce bar had some great sauces of various spice levels, which were fun to try, but my food was perfect as served. Being our first time there, we were treated to samples (wow!) and a really nice overview of the menu. The young man who took our order and provided the explanation/samples was delightful. The Samosa Chaat is NOT TO BE MISSED. Four pieces, perfect for sharing as an app. I have not been able to stop thinking about this flavorful dish!",

    "text": "Interesting concept for Indian cuisine and definitely worth checking out. The place has a great vibe and I loved the interiors. The organization and layout is great too, they are pretty fast and efficient with orders. It was quite crowded the two times I visited the place. The first time I went with a bunch of friends and it was so crowded we had to wait a bit for us all to sit together. The kebabs were great and the pav bhaji was excellent. Biryani fans beware though, it's got raisins in it, which not all of India is used to. I personally prefer spicier biryani with lots of raita. raisins or anything sweet is a no no. But the flavors and food, while it didn't blow my mind, was comforting and had a home cooked feel to it. The chai is weak, but I still liked it. The mango kulfi was absolutely delicious. The mint ginger lemonade is worth a mention too. I hope they add Hyderabadi biryani to the menu as well and a couple of popular South Indian dishes too. I also hope they add a couple of chicken appetizers or a couple more street food options. Portions are a little small for the price you pay though.   The second time it was takeout. Kudos on using eco friendly packaging.",

Lots of sauces that I thought were quite good. The lamb balls were nicely cooked.  CONS: Very expensive for what it is. You are essentially paying about $15 for a meal. That's not horrible but the quality of food is on par with fast food. I enjoy fast food but not at that price. You can probably go to an Indian restaurant and get something better for the same price. The naan isn't really naan. The food presentation wasn't great. I thought the rice was quite soggy sitting in the sauce they pour on.  Overall, this is a fast casual restaurant that offers a convenient takeout experience with relatively high prices that serves Indian food that is probably geared towards those that are unfamiliar with Indian food.",

Portions were too small for the price. The samosas had a different shape and the potatoes had not flavor at all, though the mint sauce was really good . The cheese was very different and not even close to the one we get at Indian Restaurants. It became dry after 15 Minutes . The lamb had too much of fat and looked like frozen lamb and wasn't cooked well . The Naan bread was too thin and crispy with no taste of butter . Didn't see any Indian staff in Kitchen and that explained why the Indian taste was missing in curries. The lemonade was good and different and don't see at many Indian Restaurants .",

Lots of tasty sauces are available   Speed- It was taking 13mins to get a lamb meatball wrap and Choola bowl with a naan. Little slow but it is not boring since I can watch their cooking processes. Employees might have learning curves at this moment since they started leas than three weeks.   Overall- Indian Chipotle",

The place is kind of crowded I think since I went there at noon once and also at like 4 pm once which isn't lunch or supper. Maybe it has to do with it being so new. The queue for ordering could move faster but I think this isn't restaurant's fault but merely because of the unique concept of presenting Indian food as most people think of \"curry\" when ordering Indian food and Choolah has so much more to offer. I have tried salmon tikka with salad bowl and chicken tikka with perfect combo bowl while my vegetarian wife has tried samosas, pav bhaji, and veggie bowl. The samosas kind of suck and are far from being authentic but everything else was spot on. We ate in and the ambience is casual. They have these bench and seats right in front of stalls for condiments and drinks which makes the place really stuffed up and hard to move around and I'd suggest they take that off. The open kitchen with naans being made right in front of you is amazing and definitely worth watching if you haven't ever. All my friends who have been to this place have loved it and we all will surely come here again and again!",

Our group ordered a variety of menu items and shared everything. Top of my wishlist was the tiki masala, and it was good! We had chicken and white rice and the flavor was delicious and that portion plus naan would have been well enough for a meal. A great vegan option is the cauliflower and chickpea wrap - it had great flavor! The owner also provided a small portion of the chickpea soup, which was fantastic (and also vegan)!  Other dishes we tried at the table included the Croq Choolaah Salad with tamarind ginger dressing and the Paneer Choolaah bowl with yellow lentil sauce... both also very good! What we loved about all the options were the distinct flavors and then the options to add the sauces to spice them up. We also tried the two kinds of lemonade available, mint ginger and mango. The mango was very mango-y (that's a word, right?!) and the mint ginger was just a hint but was very refreshing.  So the food: Good! Now, the atmosphere: everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. The space is very open and offered a variety of options for seating both on the main floor and upstairs in a loft. The open kitchen and modern decor make it a nice place for a quick meal or to sit and chat. I also read that it is a BYOB, so next time I think I'll have a nice bottle of white wine to go with my spicy dish!",

The sauces I tried were good, not great, but fine. They had no spice to them whatsoever. The naan was a joke. I don't know why anyone would go here when you could drive less than 10 minutes to Salem's in the strip, and for HALF the price.",

I visited here after hearing all the buzz and man, the build your own entree is overwhelming but I solemnly volunteer to conquer it as I once did with Hello Bistro. After blankly staring at the menu in awe, indecisive me decided to go for the chicken wrap and my gosh! The flavor just hits you in the face. I wanted to cry tears of joy. It's apparently the flavors I've been looking for. After inhaling the chicken wrap I seriously considered getting another but graciously decided to save the flavor for others. I didn't want to leave. The people that work there were all smiles and I absolutely appreciated it. I'm just glad I don't live on this side of town anymore as they would get all my money.",

(There are more single-occupancy, gendered restrooms upstairs.) You order downstairs and then pick up the food when your buzzer goes off.   The menu is varied, with rice bowls, salads, wraps, sides, drinks, and desserts. The chicken tiki masala bowl was tasty even without an added sauce, and a respectable portion to boot. Look out: the lamb meatball wrap was surprisingly spicy (not in a bad way, just...in a surprising way). The samosas are small but delectable, and you could totally order the samosa chaat with the mango laasi for a small meal. The vegetarian sloppy joe was reportedly good, on something like a potato roll. The biriyani was disappointing, however. While the crust was crunchy like a large, impossibly thin chip (I ate the whole thing), the inside was not particularly moist. Our table also agreed that the naan was a disappointment, having the taste and texture of pizza crust.   Nevertheless, we are likely to come back when we want a quick meal (this time we were not quick enough to qualify for free parking behind the restaurant; after 45 minutes it's $3). I still want to try their desserts--good luck having any room after all the good food you'll want to eat!",

There's definitely some venture funding behind this with how well designed and efficient everything is. I'd like to buy one of their t-shirts!  The food is good, but not the best.  Indian food is usually combined together into a smooth blend of flavors. Here, the protein is gigantic and you have to cut it up to mix effectively with your curry. I've never seen Paneer this big at an Indian restaurant in my life. The rice and curry also don't mix so well, leaving you with a sampling of flavors rather than a blend. And they don't have saag curry. The samosas, however, were good as well as the naan.  I had a good experience and I want the restaurant to succeed, so I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars. Worth a visit to experience something different.",

The veggies are absolutely delicious. The tikka masala isn't super flavorful but I haven't tried the other sauces/dals so I won't say that they are like that. The ambience is very nice with a young and hip vibe! It's a little overpriced for what it is, but overall not bad! I will be coming back again for their rice bowls.

I just have some issues  First off it's tough to make indian food \"chipotle\" style. Indi kitch in nyc tried to do it and well ...eh. I think for Pittsburgh this place is fantastic because you need something like this...regardless of location. Quick and easy Indian food.   I ordered almost everything on the menu to try in order of best to worst in my opinion:  Pav Bhaji. Awesome. Like it's homemade Samosas or the chaat: like moms   Kudos  Paneer wrap: great just like a Kati roll from Nyc  Biryani: for such a complex dish they nailed this one! Good job.  Lamb meatballs : not bad. Tastes like the ones they served on united emirates flights to Dubai. This is not an insult people.  the food on emirates is amazing. The largest airport based kitchen. Seriously. It's really good !  Now the lower end. The tikka masala curry isn't bad it's just not great! The chicken is perfect. You have that authentic smoked tikka taste but the gravy I don't know what it is something is lacking. The rest of the wraps and stuff I just couldn't get into it. Stuck with the above foods and you'll enjoy it   Just my two cents.",

Food is not hot at all. We had samosa which was not hot.  But taste was good. We had some chopped onions which was smelly and sour in taste. Sauces were not satisfactory. Guys if you want to have less food for more money you can stop by here. I would suggest better try other restaurant because with this money you can satisfy your hunger in other restaurants. I seriously don't recommend guys if you are hungry. I would suggest the restaurant to atleast reduce the prices or increase the quantity and quality of food you serve. With the price you are selling we should end up feeling satisfied.",

The way that the menu is done, you can put together any number of combinations of dishes. My favorite is the paneer perfect balance bowl, which comes with both rice and masala. The paneer steals the show for me, though. It's BBQ style, which means it's got these great crispy, smoky edges and eats like meat even though it's cheese.  My eyes probably rolled back into my head the first time I had it. I also enjoy their samosas/samosa chaat, as well as the variety of sauces on the condiment bar.  Honestly, I might be too easy to please--one of my Indian co-workers only thinks that it's all \"Meh\", and I get it because I feel the same way about most Mexican fast casual--but I also don't care because I really enjoy this place and I am glad it came to Pittsburgh! A delightful experience if you're open to braving the parking in East Liberty.",

Especially something labeled as Indian \"fast\" food. Several of the dishes were average, but a few standouts: -the dal \"masala,\" aka dal makhani - dal makhani takes hours to cook and this was executed very well. The lentils and kidney beans were soft yet had still of a bite. The gravy was silky and well balanced -pav bhaji - the classic Indian street food. The buns were nicely toasted, and the \"bhaji,\" the mashed vegetable and lentil mix, was nicely spiced and excellently paired with minced red onion and chilis.  The tandoor meat, paneer, and vegetables - when you enter the restaurant, you see the gigantic tandoor ovens to the left of the register.  The chicken, paneer, and vegetables were superb. All well charred on the outside. The paneer was soft on the inside, the chicken was still juicy, and the vegetables were perfectly roasted.  Things we could have done without: the samosas chaat. The samosas were just average.",

The proportion or rice and masala is less than what i had expected for the price. My friend got the lamb meatballs and was t very impressed. We also split a samosa chat which was alright but not the best in the area. I'd say this place is more of a 'once in a life time' type of place. I probably won't be going there again",

    "text": "Sing it with me, \"Choolaah, Choolaah! Choolaah, Choolaah!\" Okay, do you know how many East Indian restaurants that I have been to?  A lot!  Not only that, I have quite a number of co-workers who are superb cooks whose curries, vindaloos and biryanis would put most restaurant's food to shame.  In other words please don't serve me naan bread, curry or a biryani that has been sitting around for 8 years.  To me, restaurants should treat their customers like their favorite family members.  In other words, restaurants shouldn't serve you something that they wouldn't eat themselves.  That's why Choolaah is such a departure from the average (And I do mean \"average\" East Indian style) restaurant where food sits on a hot table FOREVER!  I would rather have a little bit of a wait for fresh food rather than have old food served to me quickly.  As soon as you step into Choolaah, you get the impression that everything is fresh.  The design of the place is fresh, the wait staff always seems to be freshly enthusiastic about you being their customer and most of all, the food tastes EXTREMELY fresh!   Fresh, I tells ya!  So fresh that you can actually see items being made and being taken out of the tandoori ovens.  Yay!  It's rare to see that happening at most inexpensively priced restaurants where the owners actually WANT you to see how they prepare food and what goes into everything.  (It seems like the more honest the restaurant is about how they prepare food, the more expensive the food is...)  And I like the fact that you can find something to eat here whether you are a meat eater, pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan.  How sweet is that?  And no one there tries to make you feel guilty about any of your food choices.  (I'm so sick and tired of vegans looking at me with disgust on their faces because I eat almost everything.  Hey, my parents grew up during the Great Depression and me and my siblings didn't get the chance to opt out of various food groups.  You ate what was presented to you or you faced it again during your next meal.  End of story!)  You can have one of their tandoor oven BBQ meals with meat, fish or vegetarian options (tofu and veggie BBQ OR you can have a wrap or salad with one of the previously mentioned options.  You can also have a specialty dish (E.g.,Masala Bowl with yellow lentils and rice, Chicken Biryani or Pav Bhaji - vegetarian sliders)  And don't forget to try out their various sauces. (I'm a sauce-a-holic and so is my daughter Muff.  We tried everything and used every sauce in the place in our quest to find \"the\" perfect sauce.  Woo, Lord!)  And don't forget to wash your food down with one of their lovely drinks (E.g., Mint Ginger Lemonade or one of their lassies).  Is it \"authentic\" East Indian food?  No, but who cares?  It's tasty and reasonably priced and FRESH!",

    "text": "CHIPOTLE OF INDIAN FOOD! What is striking about choolaah is its amazingly well done interiors, the place has a great ambiance, is very clean and well maintained. It hasn't been too long since this place opened up so the interiors are relatively new and contemporary with a mix of industrial style.  This would classify as an Indian fast food place. It is a self-service place with seating spread across two floors. The food isn't authentic Indian if that's what you are looking for, it's more fusion in the sense that it's traditional Indian food with Western influences. They have a variety of wraps, quick bites and on-the-go food than any other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I would say it depends on what you are looking for. This is the place for quick, fusion Indian food but for an authentic indian experience I wouldn't recommend this place. It's a hit or miss for most people we know, they either absolutely love it or wouldn't go again. It's definitely worth a try!",

This is also a BYOB which is a plus with a \"cup fee\" instead of cork fee but it's minimal.  The drinks are also amazing, I had mint ginger lemonade and it was amazing same with the mango lassi. For the first dinner, yes I said first since I bought another to go, I had the tikki masala with chicken, white rice, and vegetables. A side of naan and samosa chaat. It was all very taste and good! It comes \"neutral\" in heat so I added some choolah fire. I loved the combination of vegetables and could see myself getting a vegetarian bowl next visit.  My takeout dinner was very similar, tikki masala with chicken and white rice. It was packaged to go and the sauce was left separate so with this I felt I got more sauce which is a plus. The food also heated up well for meal 2 the next day.   All in all, it's a great \"fast food\" but still quality food. The location is great to meet up for lunch or dinner with parking off the road or garage next door. Plenty of seating on the main floor and upstairs. The kitchen is also open with neat decor throughout the restaurant.",

We get along quite well for these reasons, amongst many others. So when we decided to meet up at Choolah for dinner, we wanted to try EVERYTHING. So, instead of each of us getting our own things, drawing a dividing line across the table, being left to wonder what the other is experiencing, mouth-wise, my brilliant better half suggested we get multiple dishes and share it all. She is, on a scale of 1 to 10, the best.  This. Place. Is. The. Shit. For me, the Paneer Tikka Masala absolutely stole the show, followed up by the Chicken Biryani. We also had Samosa Chaat which was heavenly, and a delicious and refreshing Mango Lassi. Everything was accompanied by some incredible sauces that you could get from a serve-your-self style condiment bar. (I still dream of the Tamarind Apple Sauce. It haunts me in the best possible way.) Even the rice was on point.  Service: Excellent. Decor: Modern and inviting. Prices: A little on the higher end, but you absolutely get what you pay for.  Prepare yourself, Choolaah. My better half and I will be returning sooner, rather than later.",

I added a lot of the lava hot sauce and the mint yogurt sauce!  I thought the naan was good too but i do wish they did offer more than plain naan. Garlic naan is always better!

There are also not a lot of options on the menu, and the samosas and naan were really week.

You pick bowls or wraps and they come with sides. Nothing is spicy at all unless you add a spicy sauce purposefully. You sit where you want and there is a bar of sauces and utensils (again.. just like Chipotle!). It's very different from a more authentic or \"family owned\" type if Indian restaurant. The tastes aren't as rich and flavorful, but I do admit it is tasty anyway!   They have a selection of very interesting drinks. I definitely recommend trying one! I also give them major bonus points for being very vegetarian/vegan/gluten free friendly. They have 3 options for vegetarians like me. They had veggie balls (lentils I think?), tofu, and stir fried veggies. I haven't had a chance to try the tofu, so that is what I will get next time. Generally: I like it, I get what it is, I just wish it was a wee bit cheaper!",

    "text": "Choolaah Indian BBQ is a fast casual Indian food eatery which I would consider similar in style to Panera Bread. First, I must note that this eatery is a chain and is also located in Philadelphia and a few other states.  The menu is above the ordering area and well lit. You place your order, given a buzzer so that you can pick up your order when ready. They have a condiment as well as various sauces station where you can add things such as onions or spicy sauces to your item of choice.  My husband and I sat in the downstairs seating area but I did notice additional seating upstairs. I ordered the Choolaah lamb perfect balance bowl which comes with your choice of rice, veggie masala, and Tandoori veggies. My husband ordered the veggie croquet chopped salad with tam ginger. We did spring an extra $1.50 for a slice of wheat naan which we shared.  We were parked in the lot that gives you 45 minutes of free parking but as a word of advice-consider parking elsewhere because with the wait time and having to eat your food in hurry there is no way you can be out of there within that time frame. If that is not an issue to you, then the next tier is $3.00 and cards only are accepted for payment. Also, within that garage are a few spaces earmarked for 20 minutes just for pickup only.  We got our food in a reasonable amount of time and while I can say it was good it was most certainly on par with what I would expect from a fast casual restaurant. However, I found that the wheat naan was very soft, moist, and paired well with our meals. It could be used for dipping. I did taste part of my husband's vegetable croquet but it was breaded and seemed to lack flavor.  My lamb meal was good and wasn't overly spicy. I did try one of the sauces that you can fill in a small cup and believe me they are hot. I liked the decor of the place and  the cute way they tell you how you can BYOB from a nearby wine store.   I was amazed as we were getting ready to leave how packed this place got even on a Sunday! It's probably because it recently opened and the novelty hasn't worn off yet.  When you are finished eating there is a disposal station where you can recycle or trash your stuff. They even have an area where you can automatically clean your hands. A very nifty idea!  In my opinion this place is good but lacks the quality of a True Indian restaurant much like Panera Bread lacks the quality of a descent sit down American restaurant. Still, they do cater and if you want to try a fast casual approach to Indian food you would do well here. Prices are reasonable and I would definitely recommend you spend the extra $1.50 for the naan which is like a wrap bread. You can also get it as white naan if you prefer to go gluten free.  Located right on the East Liberty/Shadyside border they have an arrow outside directing you to the parking garage I mentioned on Centre Ave.",

Ordering was quick and easy, but there were many options and combos. Reasonable prices. This place can get busy around lunch & dinner times, so plan accordingly or wait it out! 5 different kinds of sauces to choose from too. I went with the Pav Bhaji, one of the street snacks. It's described as an Indian version of a veggie sloppy joe. It comes with these delicious rolls. Perfect for 2 or as a meal itself honestly. I also tried the paneer with wheat naan and tikka masala. The naan was all right. The paneer, although done well, is plain so I'd highly recommend breaking pieces of the paneer into the masala. I'm certainly coming back to try other options!   They have a cool automatic hand-washer - fitting for a place where you typically eat with your hands.",

Great flavor and the roasted vegetables were perfect. My son got a chicken wrap and devoured it. He also purchased the mango lemonade and it tasted delicious and fresh. The Naan was light a tasty too. They earn 5 stars from me.",

    "text": "WOW. Choolaah. Thank you for the wonderful dinners from the first time we came with yelp and last night. I am always a fan of these express style modern eatery, but man I gotta say Choolah really blowed my mind. First of all, the interior of this place is so unique and immediately got my attention when I walked in. I know the line at this place can be long, but they're long for a reason. It's worth it! Plus, while you wait in line you can observe the wall arts, they're all painted in the recent year, very artsy.   Oh & Please don't forget to try all their special sauces, i especially love the apple flavor one and the green cilantro tasting one. For entree, I got their perfect balance bowl with chicken and tofu. Tofu was additional charged since they don't do half protein. The second time I came I got another protein balance bowl with lamb meat bowl, and my bf got a salad. We both love our food. I love their chick peas masala. If you aren't sure about which masala to pick, you can ask to try it before you order. The food is great, and the customer service is excellent!  For beverage, I got the mango lemonade it was so tasty. I tried it the first time when I came here for a yelp event, i love it so I had to get it again! The mango is very strong, it's not like those water downed drinks you get at the grocery store. Yuuummy.  Overall Highly recommended! If you're hesitating about trying, don't be :)",

    "text": "Please note that my meal, like those of other reviewers at pre-opening special events, was complimentary. My meal would have been $12.24.  This is an Indian fast casual restaurant, offering mostly bowls of rice, veggies, and proteins, along with other Indian-American staples like samosas. They are tech and feature-forward offering online ordering and pickup, Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, and even an automated hand washing unit for customers. The ambiance is clean, modern, and upscale for the market. Dishes are about $9-$13. You can BYOB into the restaurant and they are right next door to a wine store.   I ordered a Choolaah Meal, their basic rice bowl, selecting white rice over brown, and Paneer cheese as my protein with tikka masala as my sauce. It came with a piece of naan bread. For a drink I ordered a mango lemonade.  Everything was good. Rice was cooked to a perfect consistency and seasoned nicely with the right balance of salt and hint of butteryness. The organic Amish cheese had a nice satifying texture to cut and bite into and was firm without being rubbery. The cheese was just powerful enough to not be overwhelmed by the sauce, which was good but unremarkable.  The highlight for me was the naan bread, which was just perfection. Salted and seasoned just right, cooked perfectly. It tore beautifully and was just some of the best Indian bread I've ever had. Definitely not to be missed.  Speaking of sauces, a bar of pumps has several additional ones on offer. I tried the Tamarind apple sauce and the Choolaah Fire sauce. The apple sauce went quite well with the Paneer cheese, giving it a bit of sweetness. The Fire sauce is the lesser of the two hot sauces, and I don't think I'll be trying the Lava! Fire was more than hot enough for my tastes, a little bit goes a long way.  Service was outstanding and very fast, the kitchen was working like clockwork. Despite a huge line nearly out the door my wait to order was under 15 minutes and I had my tray of food less than 3 minutes after that.  Even with the crowd, seating wasn't an issue for me dining alone.  The attached parking garage has 45 minutes of free parking, and despite the thick crowd and huge rush of people clamoring for free meals, I almost made it. I ended up paying $3 in parking, which of course was a fantastic value.  I intend to return to Choolaah as a paying customer, and I look forward to trying the local Bell & Evans humane farm chicken, their in-house ranch sauce, and one of the Tandoori wraps.",

    "text": "I had my second Choolaah experience this weekend and though there were some frustrating moments, I will still be going back.   First off the frustrations: We went Sunday afternoon for a late lunch (1:30ish). The line was long and there were a limited numbers of cashiers. We waited in line a good 15 minutes to order. We both agreed that we would use order ahead on our next visit.   Now here is where my frustration is mixed. Part of the reason the line was moving so slow is that cashiers were guiding customers through the menu in such excruciating depth that orders were taking multiple minutes to put in. One cashier actually brought samples of each masala to a group of four so they could taste before ordering. While I appreciate the commitment to customer service and satisfaction, this was frustrating to watch. I would rather see samples be given in a separate location so customers can make informed decisions before standing in line.   Now for the actual food: On my first visit I got the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb. It was exceptional. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect pairing. On my most recent visit I ordered the Choolaah salad with Salmon. I wouldn't normally order salmon at a fast casual restaurant, but the strength of my first visit encouraged something out of the ordinary. It was quite good, though not as a good as the Perfect Balance. (Note that this is probably due to the fact that I rarely, if ever, feel fully satisfied after a fish meal.)  Overall Choolaah is great. Its ordering system is a little slow (definitely consider ordering ahead!), but that can be worked out.",

The space is bright and open. There is a lot of space and 2 floors of seating. The kitchen is open and the large tandoori ovens are on display.   The food is very good we both went with the choolaah salad. One lamb meatball and one salmon. The salad was delicious fresh crunchy veggies, shredded panneer cheese, grilled califlower, golden raisins and a ginger dressing. I do wish there was a bit more cheese as it was minimal at best. The lamb was well spiced and tender. The salmon was was smokey from the grill. It was good if a little bit overcooked.  We also got the samosa chaat. Crunchy potato samosas with the mint yogurt sauce and crunchy noodles on top. We tried all of the sauces spicy mango, mint ginger, and apple tamarind we're my favorite. We tried the mint ginger lemonade and the mango lemonade too. Both were very good and refreshing.   They also have online ordering and Uber eats delivery.",

    "text": "Choo laah is amazing. If you like Indian food, this is the place to go. There are so many menu options to choose from, and every time you could get something wildly different and still be immensely satisfying.  As a chicken tikka masala fan, I was NOT disappointed. Everything - from the rice to the slight char on the chicken to the amount of sauce - was perfect. The naan was also especially delicious - try dipping it in one of their various sauces (I love the mango one!)  If you're a mango fan, you MUST try the mango lemonade. It's worth it, for sure.  The people there are also awesome as well. I said it was my first time, and I was offered a sample of all of the 5 curries along with the lemonades and mango lassi. They really know their hospitality!  The price is a little bit expensive (~$10 for a protein with rice and a sauce and naan) but it's worth it. Everything is locally sourced and natural, and you can definitely taste the difference.",

This place had been my go to for a few months but off late the food quantity has considerably reduced (like a tablespoon of dal when you order it on side? Really choolaah?) and so has the quality - food just doesn't taste the same. What makes it worse is that they don't follow instructions even when requested even in person. It's a decent place but after terrible experiences 3 times in a row I have to say that I'm really disappointed and will probably not be heading back to the restaurant anytime soon.",

The veggie croquettes were also delicious and had a nice spicy kick.  The wait staff was very nice and welcoming. I would definitely go back.",

The service was excellent and my order came out in under 5 minutes.  Now onto the food, I got a lamb tikka masala power bowl, naan on the side, and mango lassi.  The mango lassi was very refreshing, the only thing I'd say is that it could be a bit colder.  The lamb came with white rice and vegetables, everything was seasoned perfectly.  The game changer was really the sauces that they have on the side.  I tried every single one and they all were delicious and complemented the lamb amazingly.  I will definitely be back to try other things when they officially open.  Lamb tikka masala: 9/10",

I don't care so much about the prep time, but the product that I got was a cold mess.... Yes, cold. The cauliflower and peas were around room temperature.   The wraps were small and very lackluster. The naan didn't wow us, tasted like what you get at the store. The portions were small, so when part of the broken wrap (yes, the middle of my wrap was broken off) fell on me and onto the floor, I almost cried because each bite counts. The taste is a bad fusion take on Indian food, not the flavors and spices you find in real India cuisine.  Not as fast casual as you'd think. Maybe after the hype, it'll be less of a line and zoo inside.",

    "text": "Believe the hype! This place lived up to the hype and beyond.   First of all, they have made such great use of the space. You come inside and it is bright, clean, and open. The kitchen is totally visible from the dining area, including the massive ovens cooking up all kinds of deliciousness. Free parking for 45 mins in the garage next door is a huge bonus.  The ordering process is generally smooth, but the menu can be confusing at first, so you'll probably need to take a few minutes in line to figure out what you want and how to order it. Dont be deterred by the lines. I'm sure the lines will move faster as people figure out how to order.  Now, about the food (obviously the most important part). I got a chicken masala bowl with basmati rice and chick pea masala and a side of Naan. I dare say it may have been the best meal I've ever had for 10 bucks. The chicken was so incredibly juicy (it's Bell and Evans!!!) and covered in a heavenly blend of spices. The chickpea masala had the perfect amount of kick to it. When mixed with the rice the entire bowl became a hearty and unbelievably satisfying meal. I scooped up every bite with the rest of the naan. I will be back again very soon. This place is amazing.",

The menu may seem overwhelming when you first arrive but the staff is so friendly and helpful so be sure to ask. Order at the counter and your food is served quickly at the next counter over. They have plenty of seating including an upstairs.   I highly recommend starting off with the mango lemonade-it is so tasty.  You have bowls, wraps and numerous sides to choose from for your entree. The food is filing and more than enough. I always stick with the bowl with either white or brown rice topped with the black lentil daal and for my protein the paneer.  You also have lamb, chicken and numerous other meats to choose from. I have been to India a few times and the paneer at Choolaah is as authentic as you can get. Don't forget to upgrade to include a side of naan bread topped with butter and garlic. It is to die for!  If you still have room for dessert they have ice cream and I recommend the mango.",

The lemonades looked amazing and we'll be sure to try them next time. So as someone who's spent some time in India and been looking for good Indian ever since, I'd recommend it, particularly as a lighter take on Indian flavors.",

It's not a traditional family owned sit-down place... much more like a chipotle than a \"restaurant\" and I didn't really like their lamb meatballs so I can't really give it 5 stars but the chicken BBQ was terrific, the paneer wrap was also really good, and their mango lemonade it phenomenal. 4 stars seems right.",

    "text": "Choolaah is pretty much the Chipotle of Indian food--once you know that, you're good.   The space has a lot of simple tables and booths for seating both on the first floor and the second with a \"sauce\" station and an interesting queue of tablet stations where staff take orders.  The staff friendliness and engagement with the menu is definitely a high point here. Staff will walk new guests through the process of selecting/building different bowls and will even offer samples to help guests make decisions. Staff seem knowledgeable about the sourcing of ingredients.  Prices are reasonable and the menu is diverse, vegetarian friendly, and all of the items we tried were fairly high quality for fast casual dining. There are things, like the nan and samosas, which were a little disappointing if you are someone who regularly frequents some of the Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. But the bowls where you get to pick your protein, add-ins, and sauce were a great idea and made it easy for everyone to enjoy their favorite. They have great flavored lemonades, which is something different, and some \"street snacks,\" like the pav bhaji, which they describe as a vegetarian sloppy joe. Not something I've seen elsewhere!  It's been super crowded every single time I've been in there and when it's humming at max capacity it's pretty loud and can get a bit messy. Parking is a pain, but if you're sure you can get in and out in under 45, the garage next door is free.",

Choolaah gets it bang on! They don't have an extensive menu. A few simple dishes, done right.. with the flexibility to ratch up the heat or not if you're like me. I was in heaven! Paneer - mmmm.. Chana - ohh yeahhh.. Dal - oh my god yes! .. you get my drift.. lol! The Naan is delightfully light and fresh.. it really is the next best thing to eating in a Punjabi home. Don't miss their sauce/chutney station. Oh and the kulfi! I loved their decor too.. and their \"hand wash o matic\" gets them extra points coz of course, you're gonna get in there with your hands and lick the curry off your fingers one by one.",

Delivered in about 45 minutes and everything was delicious and really hit my cravings. The veggies, even with the delivery time, were fresh and perfectly roasted. The masala sauce was very much to my tastes. The tofu was seasoned nicely and cooked very well. The naan was a little too soft but still not bad. I didn't need much of the mint yogurt and it was a little runnier than expected but it was good for a couple bites. Overall, with delivery it was maybe overpriced, I'd definitely want to eat in here or split a delivery with friends, it was overall pretty excellent.",

You assemble your plate from the basics of carbs (rice, naan), protein (chicken, lamb, paneer, salmon, tofu) and accompanying flavored masala (tikka masala, chickpea, lentil). On the whole, the options are great and I recommend stopping by.  Beyond the food itself, my favorite part of the meal is the different sauces available - they're unique and flavorful. The 3 I've tried (mint-yogurt, spicy mango, and tamarind apple) are delicious. Also, if you've never tried Indian ice cream  I highly recommend trying the malai or mango kulfi at least once! It's the stuff dreams are made of - well, if you have a sweet tooth like me.",

Good news is that you couldn't go wrong with any decision you make because all of the food is delicious!   During my first visit, I was offered a sampler of the various sides, which was very generous and helped me to make up my mind for the order. I usually get the build a bowl and choose either paneer or the veggie croquette as my protein. I've also tried all of the sides on separate occasions and they are all equally good--if I had to choose, I'd say I'm partial to the tikka masala.

My favorite part about Choolaah is the charred taste from the choolaah stove on the meat and paneer. Choolaah is my go-to whenever I am working from home. They are always quick (if not early) with the delivery and the food is so flavorful and authentic. My favorite is the perfect paneer bowl. The paneer is charred and has the authentic taste. Furthermore, there is so much in one bowl, it lasts me 3 day!",

I've had the lamb, salmon, and chicken and all were fantastically cooked and had tons of flavor. Their sauce bar is also great. Lots to choose from! The freshly made drinks pair great with the food.   They offer free 45 minute parking in the lot by their restaurant. There's paid street parking nearby if you need more time.   We also ordered catering from Choolaah and people loved the food. There was a slight timing mixup but they quickly fixed it when contacted!",

The tikka masala was very flavorful and paired well with the paneer but was more enjoyable when I cut the paneer up into much smaller pieces. Also, the naan was a bit dry so I'd stick to the main entrees in the future. Excited to try the other protein options next time.  Although the menu can be overwhelming, the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. High ceilings, bright lights, and tasteful decor also added to the trendy ambience of this establishment.",

There was a big line and we had to wait for almost 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. Interiors are interesting enough to keep you occupied for 5-10 minutes. And the extra time can be spent trying to understand the menu and figuring out how to place the order.   The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful in helping us understand the process to place the order. We got tikka masala with chicken and masala bowl with chick pea and rice. The flavors are subtle and toned down to suit less spicy palate. The bowls come in appropriate quantities. All the masalas are served over rice. So, you can either mix it all together before you start eating or you can mix it as you go. Ginger mint lemonade is the best drink to have on the side while you eat the warm comfort food.   I recommend this place if you are looking for some toned down spices yet flavorful Indian food fare!",

The menu was extensive but not overwhelming. The service was helpful but not forceful. The portions were plentiful but not gluttonous.   I've never been to such a rapid paced restaurant that was still entirely focused on the customer. Someone who's never had Indian could easily create a flavorful, delicious dish. I highly recommend a Choolaah bowl with tandoori veggies.   In short, I will be returning in the near future and looking to make myself a regular here. I promise you will not be disappointed. I could go on and on but actions speak louder than words and Choolaah screams perfection!",

I have tried their paneer and chicken bowls and both are to die for. They source their paneer (indian cottage cheese) from Amish farms and its one of the smoothest I have ever tasted. Chicken and paneer are bbqd to perfection in their tandoor ovens and you can add grains/salad/condiments of your choice to make a wholesome meal. But choose your sauces wisely as a couple of them are pretty hot. I haven't stopped thinking of Choolah's food since past few weeks and that means another trip to Shadyside! Yayy!",

    "text": "Indian fast-casual?! Can't be beat. The decor for this place is very cool. You sort of walk in and need to take a few minutes to look around. Ordering can be a bit overwhelming when you literally want to try everything, so go with a friend so you can order a few things and split. Our cashier was very friendly and helpful when we made out decisions and he even chatted with us about culture, which mean he enjoys what he is doing! We ordered a Lassi, Choolah Salad with Chicken, Naan, the  \"Veggie Sloppy Joe\" type appetizer, and the black Lentils with Rice. The Salad had to be my favorite with the Indian-style Ranch dressing (which is more flavorful than the other dressing). It had chickpeas, pickled onions and roasted cauliflower, which made it unique. The Mango Lassi was good, but not as refreshing as I would have thought. It was my first experience so I am happy I tried it. The place is really clean and everyone is smiling. Parking was easy in the lot next door. We paid just $5 for 2+ hours. I will definitely be back to try some more items!",

    "text": "To be clear: I still love Choolah's quirky take on fast-casual Indian food and think it's an excellent addition to the area. I've been here enough to see that the quality and taste haven't changed over time. With that said, the execution and the way things are managed onsite, particularly during peak hours, needs a second look.  When Choolah first came on the scene you could order pickup or delivery directly from their website. Most of the focus seemed to be on in-person guests or ordering online from a single source and picking up from the restaurant. With this in mind, I sent my boyfriend to pick us up some dinner last night. He arrived with the online order having already been placed. Give past experiences I assured him it wouldn't take long. Boy was I mistaken!  A full twenty-five minutes after our order was scheduled to be picked up (and after forty minutes of total wait time) he was called to the counter to be told that they'd run out of all naan bread and he was not to receive the chicken wrap he'd wanted. He was given a piece of paper to fill out for \"the financial department\" with a vague assurance that they would look into it and probably refund us. They tossed in a couple samosas as a consolation and sent him on his way.   By my estimation, Choolah is using no less than three delivery services now, depending on your location. UberEats, GrubHub, and Postmates. I don't use DoorDash, but they're likely on there as well. I don't see an issue with offering delivery, but offering three different services significantly compounds the amount of food required to serve everyone in a way that most restaurants simply cannot handle. If you're selling, cooking, and packing food for five to ten times the amount of people your restaurant can physically accommodate, someone is going to pay the price eventually. In this case it's the customers coming into Choolah and very likely people who ordered via a third party only to have their food run out.   The thing about these delivery services is that they have no idea of current inventory or how busy a restaurant actually is. Staff are pulled between satisfying online demand and serving guests in-person. These services can be turned off during peak times or when food is running low, however there didn't seem to be anyone with the authority (or good sense) to do this last night, leaving paying customers stuck with no food and no recourse. I hope the management at Choolah takes another look at how and when they're using delivery services and adjusts accordingly. I'd hate to see a place with such potential turn into a frustrating experience for everyone!",

My server was super kind, and she explained to me what every kind of dish was when I told her it was my first time coming to the restaurant. Even though I'm Indian, and I knew what she was talking about, it was super helpful and nice that she did that introduction for every customer. I ordered the Chicken Choolah Bowl and the White Naan along with the Malai Kulfi. They have a lot of vegetarian options and you can customize the kind of daal (lentils) and the masala in the curry that you want, where I agree with another review that compares this place to Chipotle.  The food itself was great, with large portion sizes, and listen, I'm not gonna say if you are homesick for Indian food that you should come here (you should just probably cook it yourself) but objectively I would say it was really good Indian food! The food is spicy enough, which I loved. I would have liked to explore more options, but my friends and I enjoyed ourselves. The mango lassi is good, and they have this hand wash machine, that honestly, was the coolest part of my visit there. The veg options are available, yes, but they aren't as great (they definitely do meats better) but I would suggest you try this place out!",

I first ate the original one in Cleveland years ago and this location was just as delicious.   It's essentially Indian chipotle but with way more options and they bring the food out to you. They have great veggie  and vegan options as well as salmon so really satisfies all food restrictions. Food is not spicy but you can add hot sauce. Is very flavorful tho.   The only thing that was so so was the cauliflower wrap - I did not love it and wouldn't get again. But chicken, lamb, tofu, salmon-- all excellent. The mango lassi is not too sweet. And the Samosas are the perfect size and are quite flavorful.  Don't forget the sauces!!   Great for a quick lunch or dinner either take out or dine in.",

    "text": "If you haven't been to Choolaah...why not?!  This isn't your usual Indian fare. It's fast-casual; it's customizable; and it's almost best described as a fusion between American-style dishes and Indian-inspired flavors. The result is a menu that features naan and samosa alongside chicken and salmon salads. (That said, the paneer and naan chips you can add to the salads elevate them to a whole new level, in my opinion!)  This menu is definitely Choolaah's greatest strength, especially because it's so customizable. From bowls to naan wraps to those yummy salads, everything can be made and adjusted for the average carnivore or for plant-lovers alike. Spice levels are also totally in your control when ordering. Plus, key ingredients can be swapped as needed, helping to keep a meal focused on one food group over another. It's handy in cases such as people wanting to cut down on carbs, increase their vegetable intake, eat more protein - things like that.  While I find that I don't really need anything else (everything is cooked and prepared so nicely, and I'm honestly a Plain Jane at heart), Choolaah also features a sauce station for people who want even more flavor in each bite. It's a great option to experiment with flavor profiles if that's something you like to do.   They also offer ice cream, although I've never made it to dessert here. Maybe one day...  In case you can't tell, I'm in love with this place. Their food is just so good and so unique. Everything else great about the business (like the polite, hardworking staff, as well as the fact that Choolaah periodically donates part of their Monday proceeds to specific nonprofits) is a big cherry on top of my already happy taste buds. I'll definitely be frequenting Choolaah for a while to come!",

The ingredients are all of the highest quality and the lamb, salmon, and chicken are always cooked perfectly. The sauces are all good but I prefer the tikka masala and would recommend it to someone going for the first time and unsure of what they'd like. The food is generally prepared in about 5 minutes and there is tons of room for seating downstairs or up and a station to add toppings/sauces.    Choolaah is a great spot for lunch or dinner and luckily for me is within walking distance!",

They have three main types of bowls that you can choose from, depending on your preference of salad, protein, and rice. Then you choose your curry/sauce. I got the basic one - tikki masala - literally THE best. I was also craving tofu, and I literally did not go wrong with any decisioin I made. The tofu was perfect consistency, and the curry was perfect for dipping with the naan (it costs extra, but hey, can't have an indian cuisine without the naan!!). The ONLY thing I could have requested was a bit more rice. My rice was drenched in curry, making it more soupy than I would have liked, but I tend to like my rice be not as wet with sauce. It's just my preference. 10/10 would come again.",

Parking can be tricky in this area if you do not want to park in the parking garage, however our timing was exceptional and we found on street parking close by.   The food was just as good as I remember! I ordered the Choolaah Salad with Chicken and ginger dressing. I decided on the spicy mango sauce to enhance the flavor of the salad - it had a hint of sweetness with just enough spice to linger on your tongue.  I rarely get salads that are veggie forward but this combination is just perfect. The pickled onions add a nice crisp touch with golden raisins that provide a touch of sweetness and a texture difference. I was not a huge fan of the fried chips that came with it as they were really greasy. My husband got a side of naan bread and although I did not taste it, it looked wonderful and light, perfect for dipping into masala.   The main dishes run a little over $10 depending on the protein you decide on. The portions are a generous size, enough for me to make it two meals. I would be interested in trying a wrap as they looked fresh and filling!   If we end up in East Liberty, I have no doubt we will make another stop at Choolaah.",

Great place, great service, quick if you are in a rush, or equally as wonderful if you want to sit down and make it a date night. It's perfect if you want a place that isn't too overwhelming and can allow you to sit briefly or hang out a little while.   The food was basically what I was expecting. No, I did not come here for a very traditional indian food, but rather something that will just curb that indian food craving that I have been having lately. This place was perfect for that .   I had the power bowl, with tofu and tiki masala sauce. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and the sauce was great. The tofu didn't have as much of the spices as I was expecting, so since I don't have to be eating tofu (I just enjoy it when their a lot of spices and sauces for it to soak up), I may choose a different protein next time. I also paired the bowl with some naan (so good) and mango lassi.   Overall, great first experience and I will definitely back.   Note: BYOB, they did have a cork screw at the counter that you can ask for.",

The smells of spices, baked goods, and seasoned meat flow all throughout the restaurant. It's a very clean place with a bright atmosphere and friendly people. There is also a hands free hand wash station which I did not use but it looks pretty cool.  The food was also great. I ordered Tikka Masala with chicken. The rice/sauce was bursting with flavor. It was on point with the some of the better Masalas I've had. The chicken was something to rave about. Fresh, flavorful, juicy, not fatty. A quality product.    I love list of where the food products are sourced from. It always feels better to know where your food is coming from before you eat.",

We both sampled the tikki chicken, roasted vegetables, chick pea masala, it was nice to experience the well balanced flavors of traditional Indian cuisine with tender succulent chicken, flavorful roasted vegetables, delicious naan bread and perfectly steamed rice.   I look forward to going there again sometime to get a better idea of their entire menu.",

I have been to several restaurants that had Indian fusion menu and none of them can close to this place . Naan was the best item of all , it's the best naan I have ever eaten . Paav Bhaji was great too . You can order a bowl or salad along with Tandoor paneer , chicken , lamb or salmon along with side of curry ( tikka , black lentil , daal ) . All the items I tried were delicious. And I almost forgot about the interior of this place , open layout lots of windows and light and has very nice urban look .If you are around Pittsburgh and don't visit this place , I say , it's a crime !!!",

The only negative thing I'd say is that the sauces are not all THAT flavorable, as I found I had to use a lot of it to really get any True flavors. I'm used to heavily seasoned Indian fare.   The pricing is also pretty high, as a naan and an entree and a drink would probably ring up to around $15-$20. The only truly free parking available nearby is at Target on Penn Avenue. The most convenient parking in my opinion is on Spirit Street (walk down the stairs from Spirit Street and Choolah will be on your right).",

I like my authentic places a lot, but Choolah is a good, fresh take on the classics. So far, I've been there 3 times.  My only gripe is a personal one, it's a little expensive for me, so I can't go as much as I maybe would.",

I got a lamb wrap and my fiance got a \"perfect balance\" bowl with chicken, plus some naan and mint ginger lemonade which were great. The flavors weren't anything out of this world but it was very good, simple, fresh, and with quality ingredients. Plenty of condiments to choose from to spice things up. The open kitchen concept lets you watch your whole meal being prepared as well!   The chicken bowl was a good portion size; my lamb wrap was delicious but definitely on the smaller side--although it's like an Indian Chipotle, don't expect Chipotle burrito sized portions. The lamb is halal and they labeled things that were vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free pretty well.   As a side, there was a mix-up and as we were finishing eating, we were brought a second lamb wrap by accident. I told them that i had already received and finished mine but they were super nice and told me to just take the extra wrap. Great service! We will be back :)",

I was excited to come here after seeing a lot of hype on social media about it. The best way that I could describe it is the Chipotle of Indian food. If you are an Indian food lover, I think this would be a must visit!    The atmosphere inside is very trendy and clean. I love that you could see inside the kitchen and watch them make the naan- that was a fun part of dining here! It's also huge, with seating downstairs and upstairs so there is enough room to be comfortable with a large crowd. All of the staff here was super friendly and helpful with the menu & provided a nice experience for us.   As I said before, this was actually my first time eating Indian food so I didn't know what to expect. Chris and I both ordered the \"bowls\", he got the lamb and I went with chicken. The bowls came with rice & the tandoori vegetables as well. You can pick any of the masala sauces to put on top of your bowl, I chose the only one I was familiar with which was the tiki masala. They also had a few sauces to add on the side that were all unique. The sauces were the only part of my meal that were actually spicy.  We also ordered a side of naan that was delicious! The chicken and the vegetables were both super flavorful- I think it was the tiki masala sauce that I didn't love. Great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene if you love Indian food!",

I am happy to have another quick healthy-ish option in the neighborhood, but not crazy about the prices, so I will probably find myself still hitting up Chipotle once I am over the novelty of it.   Also just like no one would ever call chipotle real Mexican food, don't expect this to be 100% authentic Indian food either, although it does get sorta close.

I guess they market themselves as a \"Chipotle for Indian Food\", which would be accurate. You get to pick a protein, then add it to a signature bowl or create your own... and there are sooo many choices! I got the chicken tikka Choolaah bowl with greens and brown rice, my friends got the lamb Choolaah bowl and paneer Choolaah bowl with naan and black lentil daal. The food is fresh, flavorful and served hot... with a variety of chutneys to add to your liking. I personally doused my paneer and lamb with the mint chutney, which tasted as good as homemade. The ambience and decor of this place are incredible, very modern and unique with accents of Indian pop art. The coolest thing is that you can see  the naan being cooked in the tandoors right in front of you. The food hit the spot, and the service was also very good. I highly, highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick Indian food fix that's not the nasty, generic stuff they serve at most Indian restaurants (especially buffets) in the U.S.. huge props to the owners for this cool concept fast casual restaurant! OH! Also, the mango lassi was deeeeelish!",

Packed with flavor and the dressing (which I can't remember... something lime?) was really refreshing.  We got the samosas chaat from the street eats section and it was tasty.  I think the masala on top was the chickpea one and it was a good compliment.  We also got the malai kulfi as well and a mango lassi which my mom was a big fan of lol.

I got some of the mint yogurt sauce (from their choice of about 5 on a DIY bar). The serving was plenty and everything was so delicious! Very fresh and all of the flavors together were very nice, especially with the mint yogurt. My friend was equally happy with her chicken bowl.  Can't wait to come back! FYI, it's also BYOB!",

Their proteins are all SO DELICIOUS, though I keep going back to their salmon. I would highly recommend their Choolaah Salad with salmon. It's that rare salad that is so good, you end up eating every dang leaf in the bowl. It's admittedly pricey, so I tend to save it for quick dinners.

The naan is very thin and generally the food is mild.   The \"Amish paneer\" tastes a lot like \"Amish farmer cheese\" and has none of the sourness or creamy qualities.  One actual Indian American worker in the 20+ staff we saw.  This is the mall food court version of Indian cuisine.  They also messed up our order the first time I was here when someone else wanted something changed, I ended up with hybrid of what I ordered and what they did.  The manager gave me some free cheese as an apology and corrected it, too.  The naan so thin it's naan-existent and the biryani got merged with pot pie.

The concept - a fast food Indian ? How's that even possible - but here it is - and the concept works - it's quick- the order taking ( you order at the counter) and the preparation and yet it is delicious as if everything was cooked right then and there- and tastes fresh too ! I don't think any other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh can even match up to the flavors here at Choolah!  Am I overdoing the review ? Hell no ! The place deserves all the praises . The biryani is a must ! Though not authentic - but yet soooo nice - it's easy on the spices but high on flavor. The samosa chaat was good as an appetizer. The chicken wrap was to die for - chicken tikka pieces and the juices of the chicken just makes it perfect. A little messy to eat though ..but then it's by Indian food if it's not messy :)  The Choolah bowl with paneer was also amazing . But here comes the highlight of the day for us - the chai - an Indian would give anything for the perfect chai ! And the malai kulfi . You just need to have it !  So I'm all lovey dovey for Choolah ...it's far for me but I'm going to make sure that I get here atleast once a month !",

I had lamb with rice and tikka and tandoori veggies along with a side salad and a mango lassi.   The only thing I'd say is that the price and the serving sizes aren't a good match. The servings should larger for that price in my opinion.   Unfortunately, I'm back to being a glutard and wasn't able to have any of the fresh naan. Clearly the operation is centered around the naan ovens, so I would expect it to be excellent.   The sauces station has some great sauces as well. If I lived close I would probably come here a lot.",

I love that the daals and Chana masala can be added as a side along with tandoori veggies which are legitimately tasty and good selection of veggies. Whoever came up with the concept hit the jackpot.

Choolaah caught my eye cause I'm a huge fan of Indian food so we decided to try it.  The first impression was incredible. Choolaah is so inviting with its high ceilings, bright interior, playful decor, and just the way they are bringing technology and innovation into the dining experience.  The ordering process was fast and easy, and the cashier helped us a lot with giving us samples and suggestions. I ordered grilled veggies with brown rice and tikka masala, and my boyfriend got the perfect balance bowl with chicken and tikka masala. We also each got a naan, which was crispy and tasty! We also shared the Mango Lemonade which was honestly delicious, even though I'm usually really picky with my mango drinks. It has a genuine mango flavor, and it was refreshing withour being too sweet. Overall, the food was well-made and really good.   One thing I will say is that I really wish the food was spicier. They provide a station where you can get your own sauces and add spiciness to it, but I felt like the spiciest sauce could've been spicier (especially since it's Indian food). Part of the joy I have in eating Indian food is burning my mouth off and being on the edge of crying and I didn't really feel that here.   Nevertheless this place is truly innovative and awesome! I had a great experience and the hand-washing stations were a good touch. The art on the walls were quriky, everything was well-organized, and this place just makes me excited for the future of dining!!",

When my partner suggested we go for indian food while we were in a rush to get to our appointment, I was skeptical that we'd have enough time. Then we walked into this establishment, which is basically a fast food-indian restaurant, I was convinced that we could sit down, eat and leave soon! Unlike other fast food restaurants, however, Choolaah did not spare quality in exchange for speed. I was impressed with the endless combination of foods/proteins I could pick out. The taste was exceptional- as good as other 'authentic' indidan restaurants in Pittsburgh. Although it is a fastfood establishment, the food cost does come out to be similar to a sit in restaurant. I paid about $40 bucks for my parter and me- I did leave with leftovers. I was impressed and I would come here again.",

I barely got ANY raita, even after ordering extra and the raita I did get tasted like plain yogurt, not the delicious blend of yogurt, herbs, and flavor you normally get from a raita.   And to top it all off, I got my food delivered and they didn't pack any utensils which is my pet peeve. I stay in a hotel and don't have silverware, so without getting some with my food, I have to eat with my hands or go out and get some.

I always love the chicken bowl with rice and tikka masala with fresh naan on the side. Today, though, the meal let me down a little. The rice and naan were good but the chicken was quite burnt, many of the pieces were partially covered in a dark black char that gave off an unpleasant taste. I know it's supposed to be seared a little but this was too much. It's a shame because the chicken is raised responsibly too. I hope this is an anomaly!",

The meal would've been a bit pricey for a student, but it could've been split into two meals had I tried a little harder :) They offered samples of all the masalas and all were delicious. They also offered a sample of the mango lemonade, which I ended up getting.   The ordering was quick and easy, the layout was modern and spacious, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I will be returning as a paying customer.   My meal was to-go, so don't let the atmosphere and poor lighting in my home deter you!",

    "text": "I've always been wanting to visit Choolah. Finally, I got the chance to.  IT. IS. OUTSTANDING.   First, when you walk in, there are people who take your order with iPads- super modern and cool! The menu is big so there's a lot to choose from. You pick a protein, a base, and then you can choose any sides or drinks for extra if you want. They also have biryani (chicken and veggie) and wraps, as well as kids meals. They also list if the entree is gluten free, vegan, or vegetarian. There's something for everyone here!   The food- EXCELLENT. I chose the perfect balance bowl and added lamb meatballs and extra tandoori veggies to it. The perfect balance bowl comes with tandoori veggies, 1/2 rice (I chose brown), and 1/2 masala (I chose the yellow lentil daal). The lamb meatballs were flavorful, moist, and juicy! I also could not believe that they were gluten free too, because most meatballs at restaurants contain gluten. But these ones didn't, so that was awesome! Next, the perfect balance bowl was superb. The tandoori veggies were yummy and perfectly seasoned and grilled. The yellow lentil daal was good too. Also, there's a sauce bar where you can add sauces like mint yogurt sauce, or assorted hot sauces. They are freshly made at Choolah and taste wonderful. The extremely spicy sauce is the way to go if you're daring like me and can handle the heat, but if not, try the refreshing mint sauce. You can also add chilis and onions and even lemon to your food, if you wish. I added the chilis of course!  The service- great and very fast. The person who took my order was pleasant and bubbly, which was nice to see. The food is ready quickly, so your mouth won't be watering for too long. There's seating by the kitchen so you can watch the cooks prepare your food. It's interesting to watch!   Overall, you should definitely check out Choolah if you want an extraordinary dining experience. I really want to try the mango lassi or kulfi (Indian ice cream) next time. I will be back!",

Sides, such as half rice & half masala, a side salad or naan (which they bake right here in huuuge vat ovens!!) are available, as are street snacks like samosas or pav bhaji (they claim it's like an veggie Indian Sloppy Joe, and also wraps.  I've eaten here twice now and it's amazing!! Gluten Free, Vegetarian, and Vegan options are available. There are 'help yourself' sauces like mint yogurt, chilis, and lemon.  The flavors just pop in your mouth!! Stuff is fresh here, you can see it kept in the fridge in large containers. The mint ginger lemonade is very thirst-quenching.  I ate here today, and the ambiance is open, lively with the music and lighting. Very minimalist, well-lit. They have exceptionally clean restrooms, an automatic hand washer just outside the dining area, and an upstairs area for extra seating. They have a wall by the restrooms with magnetic poetry. Fun!! Catering and fundraising available.  Lower level is handicapped accessible for seating, but it appears the entrance doesn't have automatic doors.  If you want something different for a meal, try Choolaah. It's really tasty. I think you'll love it!!",

    "text": "Delicious little Indian joint. If you're looking for what is has been called the \"Chipotle of Indian food\", this is it! It's a bit better because, you know, Indian food. Not like I'm biased or anything.   Very clean, huge, trendy modern architecture and interior decor. Sort of a Noodles-and-company-style menu, but better.  Ordered two Perfect Balance Bowls with chicken and lamb respectively, which contained tandoori and chickpea masala. Took only minutes (10 or less) and we could have as much sauce (tamarind, spicy mango, etc) as we wanted. The raita (yogurt) was extra, annoyingly enough. Anyone who eats Indian regularly knows you need to have your raita with every meal.   Taste-wise? Not too bad, but the vegetables were slightly hard, and the naan that we added to our meals wasn't that hot. It actually was barely lukewarm. The lamb kebabs were delightfully flavorful, slightly tangy.   Overall, a fairly authentic taste experience mixed with the convenience of fast food. Will be back again to get a better look at everything!",

    "text": "I am so glad Yelp held an event with Choolaah, as it gave me the opportunity to try it out. I couldn't wait to come back since then and we finally visited again last night. If you aren't familiar, Choolaah is a fast casual restaurant that serves Indian food. It's more Americanized Indian- so don't come here if you are expecting authentic. The spice level here is nothing compared to what you will find at a traditional Indian restaurant. However, this place is still absolutely delicious.   First and foremost, parking can be a pain in this area, but if you park in the garage directly next to Choolaah, it's free under 45 minutes. Easy peasy. Customer service here was excellent- so friendly and helpful. I ordered the choolah bowl with chicken and tikka marsala, 2 orders of garlic naan, a chicken wrap, an order of samosas, and a ginger mint lemonade. This was plenty of food for 2 people (there was enough leftovers for 1 additional meal) and cost around $26. The food was ready in under 10 minutes, and was packed up perfectly for us as it was to-go. One of my favorite things about Choolaah, is the fact that their sauces are out in the open, and ready for the taking. I'm a huge sauce girl, so I adore this. I love their tamarind apple sauce (a sweet sauce), the mint yogurt, and the spicy mango. Their mild hot sauce is also delicious. I snagged a bunch of sauces and enjoyed each one. As for the food, it's all super tasty. The choolah bowl is huge, and is easily 2 portions of food for me. The samosas are on the small side and an order of them comes with only 3. Although I prefer traditional samosas, these are still tasty. The naan is thin, but very flavorful. The chicken wrap is just the right amount for one person and is super tasty as well. The mint ginger lemonade is probably my favorite lemonade ever- the flavor is just unmatched to anything else I've had.   P.S. Choolaah is BYOB & there is a wines & spirits close by, as well as a giant eagle that sells beer.",

The nah was very thin and crispy, I had chicken protein and I forgot the sauce name but it was one of the most popular one. It tasted really really good! The portion was huge! I think it would be even better if it opens at downtown! The place is very big and nicely decorated in a modern style. You can see how they bake the nan though the glass wall and I head that the technology they use to bake the nan is over 1500 years old and it is nice to see how they can apply this traditional technology to a modern restaurant.  Would definitely come back and recommend to friends.",

I went on a Saturday evening so it was busy but I didn't have a long wait. I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered a side of veggie masala and a large mango lemonade.  The side was seasoned well with a hearty amount of vegetables that were perfectly cooked. The mango lemonade was slightly sweet with a balanced combination of lemon & mango.  My server patiently helped me  place my order. She was kind enough to tell me I could do a survey and earn a free chocolate truffle. There was now way I was passing this up with my sweet tooth. I must say the chocolate ganache inside and the chocolatey outside melted in my mouth, it was satisfying treat!   I can't wait to try more menu options!",

    "text": "Wow, wowowowow. Pittsburgh finally has an amazing Indian restaurant that I could definitely see myself going to every day for the rest of my life! Best part is, it's a great place to grab something quick without having to deal with the hassle of a proper sit down restaurant!  Once I caught word that an Indian BBQ restaurant was opening in East Liberty, I immediately cleared my evening for opening day a month in advance...T minus 30 days till opening. After a long, painful 30 days of having to drive past the unopened establishment at least 3 times a week, and stopping to peer in through the windows (more times than I'm willing to admit) desperately trying to catch a glimpse of the kitchen testing out the menu...Choolaah has finally opened!!  Stepping in, you're greeted by a very modern, soothing, well lit interior that is very well decorated; I kind of want to know who the interior designer was for this place so I can hire them to redesign my apartment. What stands out the most in the interior is the giant glass walls that encase the 4 huge tandoor ovens. As much as I wanted to break through that glass and fish out a giant skewer of tandoori chicken, I didn't want to cause any delays for the staff...or get myself on their \"no feed\" list.   I stopped by with a couple friends on opening day and it was absolutely packed wall to wall. Surprisingly, the kitchen and employees were absolutely incredibly efficient in managing foot-traffic and sending out hot, delicious, consistent food extremely quickly - it was kind of mind-blowing to observe. Despite the lines going up to the top of the stairs, we made it to the order counter in no time (observing the kitchen hard at work really helps pass the time). We all ordered a bunch of things, such as the Chicken wrap, Choolaah Lamb Salad Bowl, Samosas, Tikki Masala, and perhaps the best Chicken Biryani I've ever had outside of my own home.   Despite ordering almost $90 worth of food, we had our order in hand in around 10 minutes (absolutely unreal given how busy this establishment was on opening day). The drinks were amazing as expected (love their Mango Lemonade and Mint Ginger Lemonade), and the Mango Lassi was refreshing and perfectly smooth with a punch of tartness).   The Chicken Kati Roll was wrapped in naan and loaded with sauces, perhaps a bit too much sauce for some people's tastes, but it is surely packed with some amazing flavors. I especially recommend adding some heat from their sauce bar to the rolls as they can be a a tad bit on the sweeter side. I definitely want to get around to trying their other Kati rolls too. The Choolaah Lamb Salad Bowl was a hit as well - packed with a bunch of different Indian chaat-like toppings, leafy greens, a protein of your choice, and 3 crispy naan tortilla chips. Typically salads don't fill me up, but this one had me struggling to see the bottom of the bowl, in a good way. Lastly, the legendary Chicken Biryani comes in a giant bowl baked with a roti lid to allow the contents to be cooked to perfection - presentation is a solid 10/10 on this one. Nothing beats the excitement of cracking open the top and peeling away baked bread to reveal the stunning colors and aromas of the Chicken Biryani. Kind of makes you feel like a pirate opening up a treasure chest you've been searching all your life for...but I'd take this biryani over a treasure chest any day. Once you have a taste, you'll never want to stop eating this. It's hands down the best chicken biryani I've had from a restaurant, and the pricing is fantastic for the quality and amount of food you're given.   It's very apparent that Choolaah puts great care and attention into the quality of every aspect of their food. The employees are incredible and are more than happy to explain the menu to you and ensure you have an incredible meal. It's safe to say that Choolaah has won me over and has a committed lifelong patron.",

    "text": "A close friend was in town and so instead of taking him to a more well established joint, we decided to try the newly opened Choolah. We were not disappointed.  I am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.  I ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.  The ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.  Tldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.  Update: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.",

However, I was somewhat disappointed when I tasted the food. It was bland, which is the last thing good Indian food should ever be. The Chaats were pretty good, but still nothing to write home about. Overall, I love the vibe of this place, but the food needs to be better!",

    "text": "Dear Choolaah, please take my money. I don't think there's another restaurant where I could feel so good about going out to eat, and for so many reasons.    Here's the backstory for everyone else:  They had me at \"fast-casual Indian BBQ \" and then I learned about everything else...  I was extremely lucky and was able to get an early preview of Choolaah thanks to a few great people. With that said, 3 things to note:  *1: I visited prior to opening, the staff was still training and as such..I can only imagine things will continue to improve.  *2: I don't actually know how things could get any better, but I'll certainly be returning again and again and again when they officially open.  *3: I'm so excited about Choolaah opening that I fear people will think I'm exaggerating in this review. I'm not. You'll understand when you visit.   Food:  You can read about where they source and prepare all of their ingredients if you're into that sort of thing. And if you're not, you can just be amazed by how great everything tastes.  Dietary Needs:  Anyone can eat here. Vegan, Gluten Free, Kids...most any dietary guideline can be met, and not like most places where the vegetarian and/or vegan option is an afterthought. Anyone will have ample options to choose from regardless of dietary restrictions.   Price: You can eat for under $10 and given the quality and sustainable ingredient sourcing..that's kind of amazing (Bell & Evans Chicken, Halal Lamb, Amish made paneer cheese, spice shipped in from India and blended made on site, tikka masala that takes 6 hours to prepare....you get the picture)   I would guess most people would be in the $10-$15 range for lunch or dinner and walk away quite satisfied. That estimated price ranges includes the Mango Lassi that you will want to try.   Environment:  Choolaah is worth visiting for the design alone. They are a \"chain\" with 4 other locations, but this place is uniquely Pittsburgh. Even the tandoor ovens have Steelers names on them, but not in a try-hard gimmicky type of way. Many PGH locals were involved in this project and you'll find references to Andy Warhool and other locals tastefully woven into the design.  **there's a message in binary code in the tiles on the second floor. I don't know what it says, but I'm eager for the first reviewer who figures it out.   Philanthropy: Let me pause for a second and just recognize that philanthropy is such a focus for Choolaah that it got it's own section. They're giving back in so many ways that I could write a separate review on just that.   Or you could just google it Or listen to this podcast with one of the founders  Is it against the rules to link to the podcast where I first found out about them? Going Deep With Aaron Watson interview with Co-Founder Raji Sankar (interesting fact, the same owners also own several Five Guys franchises...including the Oakland location).  I'll update again after they open, because I really can't wait until they open.",

The first thing that struck me about the place was the ambience; the artwork on the walls is interesting, the space is huge and airy, and you can see into the kitchen, where the cooks work with big tandoor ovens.   But, even better is the food. I tried the lamb choolah bowl, the lamb meatball wrap, and finally some samosas along with excellent mint sauce. All of these were great, and there are still many other interesting options I want to explore.   Finally, all of this comes at a great price point considering the great quality and taste. As I was leaving, the wonderful staff happily thanked me for stopping by. I will definitely be returning!",

You can order online, in the restaurant, or get it delivered by Uber Eats, Grubhub, and another one that I can't remember. I personally ordered online because I didn't want to wait in the line. I was given a pickup time and it was ready. After you order online, you can go to the designated online pick up register and pick up your order.   I ordered the Perfect Balance Bowl with tofu. I chose the chickpea masala. I also got the naan and the mango lemonade. I also picked up the Tamarid Apple and Choolah Lava sauce. So delicious! The flavors were what I craved they would be. The naan is crispier than I normally have it but still delicious. The chickpea masala was flavorful and the chickpeas were cooked so that they weren't too crunchy or too soft. The tandoori veggies and a nice smoky flavor to them and the tofu was also smoky in flavor.  The mango lemonade was a refreshing spin on lemonade. There is also a mint lemonade as well, I do believe. My total came to just under $15, which is a bit pricey. But I would certainly go back.",

Then you also get to taste all different sauces. And watch them cook the food in this big huge pot I'm sure there's name to  and there's more condiments that you can help yourself to. They will definitely make money if they roll this out to other cities!! The only thing I was disappointed with was the samosa. Skin wasn't fried too well and the filling was as flavorful. Would not recommend ordering that.",

In fact, technology has adopted its own use of menus to operate software. It is entirely unnecessary for technology to think it could remake the menu on its home turf.   Furthermore, this technology has replaced another thing restaurants invented called \"good customer service\". I had to give my order to the kid behind the tablet three times before he was able to translate that to the proper button pushes.   After all that, the food was mediocre at best. The naan was cold and half-stiff. The non-basmati (basmati rice = Indian food) rice was overcooked and split. The chicken tasted well grilled through the middling tikka masala sauce.   Google employees probably aren't old enough to have experienced a proper Indian lunch buffet. If they do after coming here, It will blow their mind what they get for less than the $13 they charge you here.",

Once seeing the lines I thought it would take a lot longer than it did considering it was their first day and most places would still be working out the kinks. But Choolaah was on top of their game! Employees came around with drinks and sauces to sample and there was a woman their doing complimentary henna tattoos. I started with the Mango lemonade - it was delicious!! I would go back just for that. We also tried the Mango Kulfi. It was also very good. We got an order of the samosas and they were delicious and perfectly baked. For dinner I had the chicken biryani which was perfectly cooked under a piece of naan bread. A friend and I also split a chicken wrap, which was very very good. Everything was delicious. And the owner came around multiple times to make sure everyone was happy and satisfied. I will most definitely be coming back here and can't wait to try more things off the menu!  UPDATE: I went back for pickup of an online order. I got the Chicken Choolaah Bowl with tikka masala. I arrived two minutes early and my order was already ready. The employees were extremely nice and helpful checking to make sure I had everything in my order and asking if we needed any sauces. I am still very impressed that things are running so smoothly and it's only opening weekend.",
