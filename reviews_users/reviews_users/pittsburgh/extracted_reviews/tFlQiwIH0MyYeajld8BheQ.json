    "text": "I have been here twice and I understand there's a learning curve for a new restaurant, even one that has several existing locations.  BUT, I fail to see why wait staff cannot be trained to be considerate, competent and to take pride in a job well done.  The first time there our server failed to check that the order was correct and never checked back to see how we were doing; we had to get another server to rectify the mistake.  The second time there (a month later) our server appeared to be the manager, or even the owner, but he was dressed like he just came from the gym and had a similar lackadaisical approach to serving.  The food was acceptable; not bad, not great.  I noticed there was a mention of brunch on the menu and asked about it but was told the kitchen crew was new and didn't know how to make the brunch menu so it wasn't going to be served that weekend.  We may try back in a year or so.",

    "text": "Sadly this place was a bummer. We got there around 6 and were told happy hour is from 5-7 and all appetizers were $5. We ordered our appetizers well before 7, but once we got our bill it was after 7 and the appetizers were full price. The service was so annoyingly slow, we didn't even want to tell our waitress because we were ready to leave. When our food came to the table, the waitress accidentally dumped an entire bowl of guacamole and cranberry sauce on me. She was apologetic and I was not upset because I know accidents happen, but I was surprised that she did nothing to compensate for it. Typically when restaurants mess up they take the meal off of your bill, offer you a free dessert, or something along those lines. The food was decent but even if our experience was better, I'd be in no hurry to go back. Hopefully they're just off to a bad start, but I'm not sure I'll be back later to find out if it's improved.",

    "text": "Went there on a Saturday evening for a few drinks and some food. Sat at the bar with two buddies. The place was nearly empty with about seven people at the bar. My friend asked the bartender if they had any dark beers. Bartender didn't know. Luckily there was a beer menu. We ordered a round of drinks. The bartender brought us the drinks and I asked how much. He said I don't know I have to ring it up first. So you give us the drinks and don't know how much to charge? Fine. So I gave him some money and luckily it was enough. We then ordered food. The bartender wrote down our orders on an old waitress paper pad. Had to ask us what our names were so he could write them on the checks. Maybe so he could remember which dish went to which person? All two of them. Keep in mind this place was dead. So I get up to use the men's room and they put my tacos on the bar. Cool I'll have my tacos when I come back. I come back from the restroom and my tacos are gone. They were someone else's tacos. Mind you, again, the place was nearly empty. The bathroom was horrendous. Smelled like low tide outside a sewage treatment plant. My friend used the restroom too and was disgusted. And we're no prudes. We were sitting about twenty feet from the restrooms and you could smell it at the bar whenever someone opened the restroom door. I ordered the build your own tacos. Three tacos with two sides. I got the chicken tacos. Each taco, I kid you not, had a piece of chicken in it the size of my pinky. One...piece...of chicken...each with a tiny bit of lettuce and tomato. The beans and corn on the side were maybe half a cup each. The corn was called \"street corn\" on the menu but was just corn with nothing special about it. The tacos themselves were nothing special. At times the bartender and staff were just sitting at the bar doing nothing. We stayed two hours and I had to eat again when I got home. Never going back.",

The bartender decided to take it upon herself to add another charge on to our debit card, ILLEGALLY!  Tried to have that resolved, Kori (manager) did credit us, but then charged us AGAIN. Went in there personally to get this resolved, and was told by Kori that she never should have refunded us to begin with until they figured it out. It's been 2 1/2 days. Ok she will get a hold of someone higher up and have an answer that day. No phone call. So on Wednesday it's still not resolved (effecting my bank account at this point) I call multiple times and finally get Kira- who was rude and was pretty much like \"oh well\" you're just going to have to wait.    Your establishment was holding up $100 of OUR money because of something YOU did illegally wrong.  But an I'm sorry the charges happened the way they did was all i got.  Use cash if you go there.  Obviously it's the thing to do to add charges to saved debit cards",

A fairly large portion in a fried tortilla bowl. The chipotle ranch dressing had just enough kick , but to be honest. The salad was so tasty it didn't need dressing.  Salad came with a decent amount of guacamole on it as well.  Will definitely be back to try something else. Glad to have another decent option in the neighborhood.  -ps staff was great too!",

    "text": "Not super happy with my experience at this location in Cool Springs. My SO and I decided to have dinner here, and since there was a Groupon available, I thought \"even better\"! It's a newer location anyway, and we wanted to try it out. Our server was pretty new but he was very very nice                   and attentive. Our meal was decent, guacamole was good. However, upon getting the check, we asked if we could use the Groupon. The server said he would have to go check with his manager. I said ok, fine by me. He goes over to the manager---who is eating with her boyfriend or significant other I'm not sure---and they both come over to the table. She says she can't honor because it doesn't specifically state which location it can be utilized at. (We also read the fine print and it didn't state anywhere that it could only be used at one location.) I said, ok fine. But that I'd be calling Groupon to let them know it needed to be changed. Because other's would be having the same issue. I then submitted a complaint to Steel Cactus in general, and I got an e-mail a while later from the SAME MANAGER from the location I went to.With pretty much the exact same answer. Is this for real? Why would they have her respond to the customer she already gave an answer to? This isn't professional whatsoever. Would not recommend this location.",

As I looked around it was pretty dirty.  No wait at front but still had very slow service.  Our waitress was very nice but obviously overwhelmed.   Table of 4, we had 1 meal that was ok. My wife had chili mahi. Do not get that.  It was the smallest piece of fish I have ever seen.  That is not an exaggeration.   I can't believe that someone let that come out of the kitchen.    I had carnitas burrito that was lacking the meat.  Very hard to find meat in it.  It was a big doughy tortilla filled with great rice and meat scarcely spread through it.   After our below average meals and experience we decided to go to the bar for a drink.  Nice bar and a great outdoor area.  I am sure it is a big hit in the summer.   However the bar tender seemed pissed that we sat down.  We met another couple there and I wanted to buy a round of drinks. He said I'm not ringing in separate rounds you can split it up at the end.    Bottom line: Bad food (except guac and queso) Poorly managed, dirty restaurant, stressed out staff",

    "text": "Visited SC Bethel tonight to celebrate my daughters Birthday and had a party of 9.  Our server was Brittany.   We sat outside and It became a bit windy and we were against the side wall.  We asked Brittany if we could close the side covers completely to stop wind and she said \"no\" they weee broken.  She pointed to the ceiling and said \"we have heat\". But it really didn't cover everyone.   Then the rain came and water stared dripping on us from ceiling.  We pleaded our case to move inside and only until we proved there was rain dripping  on our menus did we get moved inside.   This was just the start of a sad experience.  My wife brought a cake and candles to celebrate my daughters Bday and they took it in the back.   Fast forward to food.   I had 412 Burrito and it was pretty tasteless,  my son had the fajita burrito and he said same thing and It was filled with all rice.    My side was black beans which was weird to only have one side option and a big pile of black beans was a mistake because they were wet and my tasteless 412 burrito was also soggy with black bean liquid.   My other family members got tacos and quesadillas and were happy, though I heard the Spanish rice was too Spicy.  The most gross part of night was the fleas.   My son had one in his side dish,  my wife had one in her hair and my other son had one on his appetizer dish.  Just gross!  Brittany disappeared during food delivery and some time after. In fact another disappointing experience is after dinner someone that appeared to be from Kitchen, brought the Birthday cake out still in grocery bag and just dropped it in the table.   We had no dishes, forks or knife.  My kids had to go to other tables to get all of that and had to bother another waiter for his lighter (since our waitress was nowhere to be found).   Brittany eventually came back with the check.  She didn't ask anything about the birthday or say anything to my daughter.  Maybe this is high expectation but having 4 kids we celebrate lots of birthdays at restaurants and most are very attentive during birthday celebrations.  Overall I won't be back unless it is for happy hour and appetizers as that's what this place is built for and hopefully they will by then get rid of the fleas.  Very disappointed after my first visit.",

The chips were salty and thin; the salsa we got was spicy and flavorful.  I ordered a shot of tequila (1800 reposado) and was very surprised that a shot was really a double-shot!  And the price was VERY reasonable for the drink!  The only thing was that salt was missing from the rim of the glass (no big deal really).  I ordered the chicken tacos with flour shells and cactus (spicy food).  The flavors worked very well together and everything was delicious.  I was expecting that the street corn would be corn-on-the-cob but it wasn't.  And it was very flavorful with a hint of sweetness.  The Spanish rice was rather good too (nothing out-of-the-ordinary there).  The server (Derrick?) was attentive and joking with us.  What a great way to end 2018 and prepare for 2019!!!",

The location is nice also as you can go to the driving range or mini golf right next door at Cool Springs and then head over for some margaritas and tacos. On Monday's they have all you can eat Tacos for $15 which I definitely took advantage of eating 11 chicken/beef tacos pigging out. The mango habanero salsa is amazing however it cost $0.50 extra FYI even though it does not show it on the menu. It has a nice strong taste of mango followed up with a very spicy kick of habanero. Highly recommend stopping in here.",

My tacos carnitas were only fair.  The was an avacodo creme on top that was way over portioned and there s supposed to be a cilantro slaw on my tacos but it was not there.  I didn't realize this until later. In summary, I was unimpressed with the food and the server.",

Tasted very, very pre-packaged and all around just not great. My partner ordered mahi-mahi tacos, she liked them enough. I got shrimp tacos, definitely did not care for them, but not the end of the world, it happens. We paid, got home, and maybe an hour or so later she mentioned that she felt really off, went to bed hoping she'd feel normal in the morning. Definitely not the case, as by 2am we were both wide awake and very very sick, with food poisoning of some sort, no doubt in my mind. I'll spare you the details, but the getting sick part occurred over the next 12 hours, and the 10 hours following I was so weak I could hardly lift my head, let alone sit up or walk. One of the owners was incredibly unsympathetic, and very clearly cares more about his money than his customers. After weeks of calling and waiting for my promised refund, I finally had enough and went through my credit card company. I can't speak for other locations, but I do not recommend Steel Cactus Bethel Park. It has failed healthy inspections multiple times. Even when they were warned by us that we would be reporting them, they still failed the inspection that followed our report. That either means they truly do not care at all, or that it really was so bad beforehand that even with improvement they still failed.",

Upon arrival we were seated in a timely manner. The wait staff was pleasant but they did not seem to be in sync with the chips and salsa. We ordered salsa and got corn. The waiter quickly fixed the problem. I ordered buffalo chicken tacos and they were mediocre at best. There was very little chicken and the chicken was dry and crunchy. My husband had a beef burrito and there was about a tablespoon of meat and a tablespoon of beans on it and the rest was rice. If he wanted that much rice, he would have gone to Silk Road! While he was facing the bar area, he noticed that the female behind the bar, that appeared to be a barback in a green shirt, was continually picking her nose and he never saw her wash her hands.  That evening and the next 2 days we were both sick with GI upset. We will not be back.",

Very nice space, but it was a bit warm on the night we went and the sun is a bit brutal for the one part of it we happened to be seated in.   To get started, we went for the $10 margarita pitchers, which were decent. The mango and strawberry flavors were fairly sweet and could have been a tad stronger. Next, we got the dip trio. The pineapple salsa was good, the queso was average, but the guacamole was too bland. It needed salt, lime, and cilantro. To boot, their chips are too plain as well.  For an entree, I went for the pricey Molcajete Bowl. The lava rock bowl is pretty neat. It is, as stated, EXTREMELY hot. My food was simmering for at least 20-30 minutes I believe. It was a very tasty and hot dish, maybe too hot for an already hot day. It comes with 4 small tortillas, which was not enough. Regardless, I really liked this dish and I would order it again. I could see this place teetering on 4 stars with another visit or two.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Steel Cactus with the first one being for their \"soft opening\".  There was nothing that great about the place to pull me back in for Round 2 ... until tonight. We were looking for a place that offered a patio in case it didn't rain and always up for margaritas.  Their Happy Hour is pretty decent. Basically all appetizers are $5. We had the Chicken Taquitos and they were d-lish!! They only offer the $10 margarita pitchers for \"on the rocks\" ... NOT for the frozen????? So a frozen margarita will set you back $8 and it is NOT an $8 margarita. This is why I'm giving them 4 stars by the way.  I had the chicken fajitas and they gladly gave me more red peppers to substitute for the green (which I hate). There wasn't much chicken, perhaps 1/2 breast? My sister also got fajitas but got steak and chicken and had the same amount of chicken as I did but then also had quite a bit of steak. So I would suggest getting the combo and paying a few dollars more. The Mexican street corn was extremely spicy (due to the aioli) and none of us ate ours. Such a shame because the corn from our first visit was some of the best I've ever had.  Our server was in training and this young girl was phenomenal! She was very accommodating and tried her best to make us happy. When she saw I hadn't eaten my corn, she offered to have the kitchen make more and remove the spicy aioli so I could take it home with me. Please treat her well so she never leaves!  Won't wait a year to return again this time",

    "text": "I stopped over here for lunch to visit their newest location. This Steel Cactus is on the far end of a small strip mall located on the property of Cool Springs complex. The strip mall faces Lowes on the other side of the street. This location has been open for about a month and half.  When I arrived I was greeted warmly and led to a table. The place is very clean and well organized. I had a very nice waiter named Nate who explained to me that the outdoor seating area will be heated enclosed during the cold weather months and they will bring in live music.  Since this is a Mexican restaurant, the menu has your typical items such as tacos, burritos, entrees, salads, soups, etc. along with chips and salsa. I passed on the chips since I was more interested in the colored markings on the menu itself. Those markings will indicate whether or not an item is hot and spicy, vegetarian, or vegan. If you want to order gluten free then there is a separate menu for that. You can also have tacos your way. Take out is also available.  Certain menu items comes with a choice of two sides-usually Spanish or regular rice and either pinto or black beans. I went with the vegan beef taco which was made with blackened tofu, avocado, red cabbage, corn, and avocado sauce. My meal was served with the two sides in small cups similar to what you would find in a deli. I enjoyed the tacos but they seemed a little bland-no too much flavor to them. The black beans were very good, the rice-nothing more than a small cup of white rice.  Nate told me that Steel Cactus is continuing its expansion out of the city with new locations in Canonsburg and one in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. There's also one at the airport which I visited briefly earlier this year. I like the fact that they are expanding to the suburb areas since their three primary locations = Southside, Shadyside, and PNC park all involve parking issues unless you get lucky. I also like the fact that it gives people who don't travel to those neighborhoods the opportunity to experience what they have to offer.  The strip mall where it sits has its own parking lot and a few other businesses have opened up here. They have a full bar and the famous skeletons hanging around to give you that Mexican vibe. In addition they serve brunch on weekends.",

While Steel Cactus has a nice outdoor patio to hang out and get a few drinks with friends, the food really is not good.  Both times I've visited, the service is really slow as well.  I would go back for drinks but would opt to eat elsewhere.",

We have had great experiences at PNC and Shadyside. We have tried this location 3 times - with mediocre to bad experiences each time.   We went in with 10 people tonight at 945. Sign on door says open until 11. They literally turned us away - saying they close their kitchen. Literally not one person was there. That tells you how bad the place is. They had nothing to do and instead of welcoming some customers - they made clear they were closing.   Will be calling the ownership tomorrow.",

    "text": "Unfortunately did not have the best experience at this new location. Fingers crossed it is just because they are getting the hang of things due to the fact they are newly opened. However, it is hard to excuse grey chicken and a not so nice bartender.  My husband and I frequent Steel Cactus often and were SO excited they were opening a location by our house. We went on a nice day and I have to say the location is awesome. There is an indoor/outdoor bar seating area which is really nice. Only downfall is there are no TVs outside which made it hard to watch the football game on. They also have cornhole outside which was a fun addition!  Our bartender however made the nice day not so nice. She clearly was super uninterested in being there. We were two of about 10 people there and she kept forgetting things, never checked on us, and I don't think smiled once. I'm sure it was just a one off day, so hopefully next time service is better.  We started with the dip trip which was tasty! I love their queso! Next we both ordered tacos. I had asked if I could get 2 chicken and one veggie (they are the same price and I was asking them to be the same \"style\") however our bartender told me no can do. The southside location always does this for me but oh well- I got all chicken. How sad I am that I did. My chicken was literally grey and hard. I haven't had a taco since because I was so weirded out. Woof! I will say my rice and beans were delicious so I only ate those. Thank gosh we had that dip trio.  It will be awhile before I return here. I'm hoping it's only uphill from here and next spring they'll have the groove of things.",

    "text": "Really disappointed in this new location.  I have been to the South Side and Shadyside Steel Cactus and was excited for this new spot.  I'm not sure how the food and service can be so different, but it was definitely not near the quality of the other locations.  I do really like the setup of the place.  The indoor/outdoor patio is a great spot, especially when there is good weather.  I wish they would have closer tvs for the outdoor portion however.  Our service was very poor.  Slow, forgetful, and not very friendly.  This could certainly just have been the case of one bad employee, however it did not make for a good start.  For food I had the buffalo chicken tacos.  They were so wet and sloppy that it was almost impossible to eat.  The shells seemed old as well.  I have had these at other locations and enjoyed them so I am not sure why they were so poorly constructed here.  I'm hoping they are still working out the kinks and will eventually be on par with the other locations.  U til then I'll stick to drinks only at this spot.",

I had the fish tacos, wife had the steak fajitas and neither were bad but they weren't noteworthy.  The search for good Mexican continues.  The price is reasonable and they have a huge outdoor area and good beer and cocktail selection.  Quiet noisy even if the place isn't full.",

Don't expect to get crunchy tacos here- they came out soggy and fell apart all over the plate. The chicken was grey and hard. NO WAY was I eating that! I had multiple issues with my meal and my plate sat there untouched for 20 mins. Service was SLOW and no one came over to check on us.   I will never, ever come back to Steel Cactus!

Love the new layout however it was raining so we didn't really get to enjoy the indoor outdoor atmosphere as soon as the weather breaks in the near future will have to come back. The tacos were good I also had a yinzerita so if you've never had one I would suggest getting that too. Lastly I would recommend the churro sandwich for dessert I'm not a big dessert person and I ended up eating more than half of it as I supposed to share with my wife.",

I've eaten here twice and the food is HORRENDOUS (gave them a 2nd chance, unfortunately)....probably top 3 worst places I've ever eaten. My wife had a salad that was missing like 3-4 ingredients, with charred black chicken and translucent (probably previously frozen I'm guessing?) avocados....they remade it and it was just as bad the 2nd time around. If I could figure out how to share pictures, I would. It's astonishing to me that someone in the kitchen/leadership team is actually letting this food be served.  I'm not surprised by the negative reviews, I am surprised that there aren't more. To make things even worse, I have quite a few acquaintences that have had simliar experiences - all negative across the board. Go to Taco Bell or Moe's - at least the food there is pallatable.",
