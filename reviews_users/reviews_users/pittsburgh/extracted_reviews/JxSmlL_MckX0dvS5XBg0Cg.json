I ordered within 2 minutes of walking in, the #9 (The Artemis sandwich) which is just veggies, feta cheese and french fries, along with a side of hummus. I paid and as I was waiting for my order, another gentleman came in and sat at the counter to be served before me. It took them 20 minutes to prepare my food for a takeout, while I was the only one there. There were 3 workers, and none of them were friendly. The food was pretty good, but I don't think I'd go back and spend over $10 for a to-go lunch.",

Ordered chix gyro and gyro salad.  The pita bread was  burnt but that was good since it complimented the excessively charred meat! It was suppose to be chicken but I am honestly not sure because it was so burnt I could not absolutely tell whether it was chicken, pork, or beef.  I cannot imagine how they could think it okay to give this to someone to eat!  The gyro salad was not burnt but the lettuce was limp and sour.  The gyro meat was good as was the few French fries on top.",

As a warning before entering the shop, don't expect enthusiastic or friendly service. If you want a delicious gyro sandwich with a distinct Pittsburgh flare, I highly recommend one of their gourmet delights! A personal favorite of mine is doused with their spicy Tzatziki sauce, earning it the menu title of Hades.",

It is a very small restuarant and most people seem to do take out.  It is a bit far from my house so I usually eat in.  There is usually a table available...even on a Friday or Staurday night!    It appears to be family owned and operated as sometimes I can't understand the gentleman in the back!    The food is great and in large quantities.  They provide a variety of options to get your gyro and the cucumber sauce is fantastic.  I suggest that if you love GYROS as I do...try it out.  You will not be dissappointed.",

Well that didn't happen they said there was no way to confirm what I'm saying. So their employees don't do their job & I popgot screwed out of my food they actually owe me.  Really I'm gonna try to work them for 3 gyros I order there all the time. They made me out a liar which I am not & lost a good paying customer along with my entire family & close circle of friends.

Ugh, sacrilege!! However, to prove my friend wrong, I had to try this place. To my surprise, Olympos was delicious and, dare I say, better than Mike & Tony's. If you've been a long time Mike & Tony's fan, Olympos will remind you of Mike & Tony's from 15 years ago...back when Mike & Tony's loaded your gyro with a ridiculous amount of meat, put oregano on top of your gyro, and had more spices in their sauce. I will say that Olympos is considerably more expensive for my usual order ($14) compared with Mike & Tony's ($8.50); however, I will gladly pay the price difference. Olympos has a better location that avoids the non-sense of South Side, has free parking, is cleaner, and has better clientele. They also just implemented a rewards program so you can earn free food. I still love my Mike & Tony's gyro, but Olympos ranks right up there. You can't go wrong with this place.",

Of course, if I can choose to have it elsewhere, I certainly will, and this wound up putting me at Olympos Gyros today. After seeing the menu online, I was already excited by the many different names and styles. This is the first place I've been to which used different mixes of Tzatziki sauce, and that concept grabbed my attention from the start. I went for the ranch Tzatziki on the Poseidon, and my buddy took the spicy Hades. Both were prepared quickly and much to my expectations, they were piled high with meat, lettuce, and another surprise, French fries. Needless to say, I was prepared for what would come next. The first bite had me hooked, and the next minutes were nothing but working to devour the rest of this masterpiece. I've been going to Robert Morris for the past three years and was upset that it took this long to find this great place. I hope to come back as soon as next week, but this will definitely be in my thoughts as next semester approaches.",

    "text": "In regards to the great secret underground Pittsburgh Gyro War, everyone has their favorite and is loyal! Twenty years or so ago, there would be no question... Zorbas' downtown (in the original location, on Wood St., I think), is the best that there will EVER be. (period)... end of story.  BUT since that gem is long gone, and, sorry, the NEW location for Zorba's doesn't come close, & EVERY pizza joint and food truck now sell gyros, who has the best?      I tried several of the pizza shop gyros, and most of them were just ok.  They were all about the same... so to save time I decided not to include the pizza shops in my search.  Prior to Zorba's, Salonika's on 6th was the place to go (until Zorba went AWOL & opened his own place!). I had heard for years that Mike & Tony's was THE place, so I finally gave in and gave them a try... just to be fair.  Again, the gyro was just pretty good. Nothing great. It could have come from a vendor at any street fair. I know how rabid their crowd is, and how they insist that Mike & Tony's is the Holy Grail of the Pittsburgh Gyro, but I'm betting most of those gyros are the ones you get at 2AM after you get your drunk on.  My Big Fat Greek Gyro in Market Square (deceased) was VERY good, as were most of the other gyros from all of the other places that I have tried (the 'Burgh has a surprisingly large number of Greek restaurants)!    I thought that I found something at the Central Diner in Robinson when I ordered their killer gyro platter. Tasty.  But after today's re-visit to the mighty Olympos, I think I have my winner. I have tried several of the different style gyros here, and they have all been AWESOME.  Great flavor, generous portions, and always consistent.  I've never had a bad gyro from this place!  If not the BEST in the area, it has to be in the top 2!    I intend to keep exploring and searching for the BEST gyro in the 'Burgh, but to be honest the search will be a bit slower, as I intend to come back to Olympos more often!",

I always get an original or a Zeus if I am in the mood for fries. Their tzatziki is delicious, and their gyros are always overflowing with filling. Plenty of meat and plenty of toppings. Their baklava is delicious as well. I drive from Pleasant Hills just to eat there, even if I have no other business in Robinson. Worth the drive every time!",

While it is in a very unassuming spot on Steubenville Pike, it delivers a punch when it comes to their gyros. I originally stuck with the standard gyro, but the #4 (Hera) is just the perfect combination. It has BBQ Tzatziki sauce and it is just delicious, it also comes with fries and an onion ring ON THE GYRO. I couldn't get enough.   I suggest this place to anyone that wants a solid gyro in the Robinson area.",

This thing is huge and we shared it, the meat was perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned. The fries on the gyro were a stroke of genius and the spicy taziki, well I may never eat regular taziki again. Service was quick and very friendly.

As the reviews all suggest, you don't come here for ambiance, although the company (other customers) is pleasant.  The owner is less than conversational, but that pales in comparison to how good and the portion this food is.

    "text": "I tried Olympos Gyros out for lunch today.  It's lent, and in Pittsburgh that means long lines for fish sandwiches, so I figured it'd be quick, and since I'm almost certainly going to burn in hell anyway...why not eat meat?  It was quick, so at the very least I'm half right.  I ordered the \"Zeus\" off the \"specialty\" menu and got my gyro in about 5 minutes.    It was slightly too big to carry in the little brown paper bag they give you so I had to cradle it like a newborn on the way to the car.  After I unwrapped it back in my office I thought maybe they'd forgotten the pita...because I couldn't see it.    The Zeus is Chris Farley's proverbial \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\"...it was messy and there was so much stuff inside the pita that the pita itself couldn't be found.  Once I did find it, I spent probably three minutes trying to figure out the best way to hold it without it turning into a complete nightmare.  (There is no best way).    Tasted great.  I loved it.  But okay, seriously...Greeks, it's okay to make a pita slightly larger so that you can accommodate more stuff.  Pitas do NOT have to be one size fits all.  Or wait...do they?  Is that one of those weird ethnic rules that a REAL pita will only measure 1/2 cubit in diameter or something?  I don't think that's a thing.  Is that a thing?  Anyway...super good, fast, cheap, consider a fork, or barter for a bigger pita.",

They come 3 to an order, but they are double the length I usually find in local places, so it's more like getting 6. The hummus came with grilled pita wedges and was the good balance of garlic and spicy- very smooth and creamy. Perfect pita/hummus ratio so nothing was leftover without a partner for dipping!  This was my first visit and the men who served me were polite, friendly, and fast. I'll definitely be back to check out the gyros with my family.",

    "text": "I love gyros and when I saw the reviews that Olympos got I knew I needed to stop by.  First of all, this is a small storefront in a non-descript shopping center - pay close attention to your GPS.  It is the parking lot next to MedExpress which might be a little easier to spot on the road.  As mentioned in other reviews, this is a no-frills place with 6 tables scattered about a room with limited decor.  The dining room is on the dark side and the menu is on the wall on the left as you walk in.  You order at the back on the right.  The counter folks are pretty gruff and not interested in conversation.  They had 2 cones going and were regularly slicing.  I thought the meat was on the dry side, but the portions were good sized and the veggies fresh - oregano on top was a nice touch.  I got two sauces on the side - bbq and spicy - and thought that neither were particularly flavorful.  Overall, a mediocre experience.  Gyropolis in Minneapolis is my gold standard, but I feel that My Big Fat Greek Gyro in the burgh does a better job in nicer surroundings.",

I thought well the service must make up for it........I was wrong. There was one lady in front of me and the place was empty. I was not greeted nor looked up at.  Once it was my turn to order, the man was very brute and unfriendly.   I decided to leave and go to the family owned Greek diner \" Central Diner & Grill\" down the street. They actually acknowledge you and have fresh Dolmas and gyro meat.",

Mounds of Gryo Meat, French Fries, with ample amounts of lettuce, tomato, feta, and cucumber sauce (tzatziki) for about $7.  The Gyro had the right balance of flavor you expect.    The portions were large but I was able to keep my place in the clean plate club.  If you want an old school gyro  - this is the place.  I will be back!",
