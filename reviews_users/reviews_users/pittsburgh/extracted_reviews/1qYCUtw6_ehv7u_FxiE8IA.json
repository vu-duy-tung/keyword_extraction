It's a little pricey, HOWEVER, when you consider the price spent on a regular pizza and how much of that you will eat, this equals out to being relatively close.

The pizza is a deep dish siscillian style. I got the spicy pie. The outside of crust that hits the pan is crispy and tasty. I didn't care for the inner crust which seemed doughy and breadlike. There didn't seem to be much toppings on pizza.  Overall it was worth the trip but I wouldn't go back due to pay parking. Price seemed a bit steep for 6 cuts, and in my opinion just better options out there.",

The almost-burnt cheese around the crust is a very nice touch. I have had the Heirloom and the White, and they both have a slightly lemony taste to them. The cheese is very decadent. I know they make at least the cheese on the Heirloom in-house. I really hope Iron Born opens its own location after its time at Smallman Galley is up. It will thrive!",

The crust is super thick deep dish style that is cooked in cast iron pans with butter or oil. The butter edges are crisp and flavorful and the middle is soft and fluffy. The toppings are high quality. I have had both the red and white pizzas. The white is definitely my favorite because it was different than a traditional pizza but the red is also excellent.

But YALL.... THE CRUST. Remember the only little Cesar's crust? I don't know if they still make it but the square one that's sort of deep with the awesome cheesy edges? This is the grown up version of that. Crust shouldn't be that delicious. I am very pleased with my decision and y'all should go get fat on their pizza. Like right now.",

I love how large the pieces are, and I also love the crunchy crust.  It's very obvious that the pizzas are crafted with the highest quality ingredients.  This chicken wasn't your average chicken that you see on faster paced pizza shops. It tasted like the chicken you would have on a rotisserie.  I look forward to trying something new next time.

Detroit-style-esque with a super fluffy and softy middle and nice and crusty/crunchy/toasty crust. I can only speak to the red pizza as that's what I've gotten both times, but it's phenomenal! Big enough that you can easily split between two people--and since it's Smallman, you can get a side from any of the 3 other vendors if you chose! My husband and I like to get a red pizza from Iron Born and a Brunoise burger from Brunoise and split both!  This place is definitely worth the trip of you're craving pizza that you can get at any other pizza joint in the city!",

Iron Born's pizzas come with six square slices. I recommend trying two different styles of pie and swapping - that will provide more than enough for a meal and late night snack (or future meal)! The crust has just the right amount of crispiness without coming off too heavy (looking at you, Chicago-style - still love ya, though).   On our visit over the summer we also ordered a salad to share, which I'd recommend skipping. Get your veggies elsewhere. Get your pizza here!",

Anyway, from what I remember you order than pick your own seat and you get water and napkins and sit at these cool wooden tables (ours had a hole in it and I had fun looking at my shoes through it). Eating is easy at this place.  We got two, the Red Pie and the other I don't remember but I think it had arugula on it. Both were good, though I preferred the mystery vegetable one, the taste being much different from anything I've tried. Crust has amazing crunch and flavour. Toppings and sauce taste-wise the mystery was a 5 and the red was a 3 (but very tomato-ey and I'm not the biggest tomato fan). I am interested in trying the other options.  They are very filling. VERY. And all you will want to do is sit and eat the whole thing. I know I did. I would say this is a must-try place for any pizza-lover.",

But ohhhh they were right. We entered the zoo of Smallman Galley on a Saturday evening, placed the order, climbed over a herd of people and a mountain to grab a table in the bar area, and waited. Soon, our individual trays of pizza, thick and steaming, came to us. Each slice tears well, indicating a good yeast dough, and not too much sauce, so it's not wet. It's closest to focaccia with fresh, delicious toppings. We told ourselves we'd take home the leftovers. We demolished those pizzas and there were no leftovers. I was happily in pain for the sake of that pizza, and when I have the gastronomic fortitude, I'll be back.",

    "text": "Move over literally every pizza joint in Pittsburgh because there's a new king in town. The pizza Gods must have personally blessed Chef Pete Tolman because these pizzas are otherworldly.  There's no one in the burgh making pies quite like this. It's a Detroit style pizza, which boasts an extra thick crust that is somehow perfectly spongey and crispy in all the right places. It's baked in a cast iron square pan. But here's the kicker: cheese is spread over the edges of the dough and as that cheese bakes, it caramelizes and gives the crust an extra kick of flavor and texture.   My favorite so far is the basic (but who am I kidding, it's anything but basic) red pie. This may be a weird thing to say, but you can really tell that every single ingredient is high quality. The sauce, the pepperoni, the cheese, everything tastes amazing and all together it's basically perfection.   My next fave has to be the Fungi pie. I could live on mushrooms and cheese and bread so this is pretty much my dream pizza.   The white pie is a fan favorite: Garlic Cream, Caramelized Onions, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula and Ricotta. The flavor combo here is striking. I'm not a huge fan of caramelized onions (I find them to be too sweet and over-powering) but I just scrape the onions off and voila! Deliciousness!  In case you can't tell, I'm a little obsessed with this place. I make my husband get take out from here on his way home from work at least every other week. I wish Chef Pete the best of luck and I hope to see him blessing the burgh with his pies for years to come.",

And the fennel sausage on top-omg, to die for. This pizza is super crispy on the outside, but soft and almost doughy on the inside.

    "text": "Full disclosure-I've been a fan since the first pop up a few years ago, finally getting around to posting a review since I was at Smallman Galley Friday night. Until IronBorn, I'd never heard of Detroit style pizza. Now I can't imagine life without it. But not just any Detroit style. This Detroit style. I've tried a few others, to be fair. Nope. Not even close. The dough here looks like it's going to be heavy, dense. But from that first bite of a corner piece (and yes, it DOES need to be a corner piece don't argue with me) you experience a light, but chewy, crisp, cheesy dough. Yes, he puts cheese around the perimeter of the dough that gets melty crisp while it bakes in its metal pan; that's why you start with a corner. You're welcome. Then come toppings. All fresh, many made in-house. I know the guy who supplies lots of the cheeses used and Chef is buying the good stuff! He uses as many local ingredients from local suppliers as he possibly can, and credits them on the menu and on social media. That is cool. Not everyone does that. Back to the toppings- many traditional toppings may be had, but Chef Pete really shines when he's dreaming up the seasonal pies. Smoked pork, coffee barbecue sauce, house made pickles, a pie with all the meats! Honestly, why are you wasting time reading this review when you could be making your belly smile with a pie from IronBorn?",

Iron born stands out because the crust reminds me of a Chicago style deep dish pizza and there are not many of those around.   I ordered the Red pie ($15) which came with pepperoni and cheese. All of their pies are 6 square slices. I would highly recommend Iron Born if you are a thick crust fan! The only down fall would be the set up. Iron Born sits inside Smallman Galley with 3 other restaurants. The line situation gets confusing, it's in the strip so plan on parking far (unless you get lucky) and seating isn't monitored by a hostess or anything. It reminds me of a food court, when you see a spot you better snag it quick because this place gets busy! It's like real life hunger games, but I promise it will be worth it in the end.",

    "text": "Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.  Iron Born Pizza, aside from having a very cool name, delivers really good tasting pizza.  Its the pizza of my childhood but much better.  It's the pan pizza that I think most restaurants wish they could be but can never get there.  I'm a bit partial to Neapolitan style pizza but I would be very happy eating Iron Born pizza any time.  What makes it so good?  For starters, the crust is just so flavourful, light, and yet has a great hearty crust that shatters a bit when you bite into it.  They call it Detroit style... I'll just call it very good.  Spicy Pizza - The ingredients were very plentiful and bold ... it made me quite happy eating it.  The spicy pizza had hot soppresata, pepperoni, banana peppers and the interesting addition of spicy honey.  It wouldnt be my first thought but I loved it after the first bite... you get the wonderful pork flavour, hit of the spice, and then this really nice sweetness at the end. 4.5/5  I loved the fact that you had a wonderful hot pizza literally in minutes and it was so affordable.  So if I had to come back to Smallman Galley, Iron Born would definitely be an order.  Perhaps the white pie next!",

Of course there are other great unique places around the city but really glad the pizza scene in the Burgh is expanding in a good way.  Was on a quarterly Strip District excursion today and stopped into the well reviewed Iron Born Pizza.  Having experienced Buddy's in Detroit recently I was anxious to see how this stacked up?  With a resounding 4 stars I was very impressed.  Lite dough with crispy cheesy edges and subtle toppings this was delicious.  I stuck with a cheese pie and a Red / Pepperoni Pie.  Both exceeded expectations.  Hats off to Iron Born.    If you are in the Strip find this place.   Also great reheated in a 350 oven for 10 mi",

The crust is crispy on the edge to perfection and light and airy in the middle.  The pie choices will make everyone happy.    My personal favorite is the White Pizza. With fresh greens, blistered tomatoes and fresh Ricotta it's my favorite go-to pizza.    For being a deep dish pizza, the pizza isn't heavy in your stomach.  We each usually get our own pizzas but share and have enough for a late night snack.   The Smallman Galley offers a full bar to compliment the drinks. My favorite place to sit at Smallman is along the row of restaurants.",

Most recently, I came on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the red cheese pizza ($13). Yes, it's a little pricey, considering you only get 6 slices, however it is a very filling pizza, and is absolutely delicious. Thicker bread, lots of cheese, delicious red sauce, fresh basil and parm- omg...I'm drooling thinking about it. As others have mentioned, this is \"Detroit style pizza\" and I've never had the opportunity to try anything like it in Pittsburgh before. It's a must-try and I really hope Iron Born finds a permanent home after their time at Smallman Galley is up! Dreaming of the next time I will be visiting...",

The Red Pie was much better than the broccoli, bacon cheddar one, but not enough to make me run back... and I think  $15-$18 for a personal sized pizza is a lot.  Still, its hard to make it as a new restaurant in the 'burgh and they seem to be doing it -- so there must be lots of folks looking for something different (which this definitely is) ...I wish them the best.",

Hard to find so look for the \"Smallman Galley\" door to the food court across the street from the church and wander around to find it.  The pizza was delicious. Six slices per rectangular pie. The toppings are varied, fresh and delicious. The white pie came with fresh arugula, Ricotta and sweet caramelized onions make a nice combination/contrast.   The meat pie (we added an egg on top) was flavorful and just a little bit of spice. The crust has a nice combination of crunchy putter crust and soft inside with a neutral taste to set up the wonderful toppings.  I would love to see the chef get a little more creative from his experience at Alinea but, that is a quibble. I would have given it a 4.5 just shy of a 5 rating as I expected a bit more creativity.",

I would say Iron Born Pizza is among the best pizza i have ever had. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the area. And I will definitely be going back again. Only thing I can say is get there when there is no crowds as otherwise you could wait a while as the Spellman Gallery is very popular and gets crowded really fast.",

I got the Spicy Pie and it has a teensy bit of honey, making it a sweet heat.  The crust is Detroit Thick and the personal size is perfect to sink your teeth into - You get six pieces and though starved, I could only enjoy four of them - with a perfect breakfast next morning.

    "text": "3.5 review.   I ordered the red top pie for ~$15, which would definitely feed 2. The pizza was really good. It wasn't the best Detroit style pizza I've had but it was solid. The cheddar-fried crust was a nice twist. I give the pizza a 4. A side salad option would be great to cut the heaviness of the pizza. Their website says that they do have a salad, so either they didn't have it when I went, or I missed it.  They told me that it would take approx. 30 minutes to get the pizza, which was pretty long to begin with, but I was happy to wait since I had been looking forward to trying the restaurant for a while. But, the pizza didn't come out for 50 minutes and there was no apology when the pizza did finally come. At a place like Smallman Galley, where people can order from different restaurants, the wait was especially annoying because my group, who had already finished their meals, had to wait for me.",

Chose the prosciutto pizza which came with fresh, thin sliced prosciutto, dressed arugula, shaved parmesan cheese and pistachios. The deep pan style pizza provides some of the best crust you will find and the fresh ingredients make this pizza absolutely amazing! When back the following morning for a coffee, scoped out the breakfast pizza which equally impressed visually and came with a sausage gravy, fingerling potatoes, carmellized onions and more.  The service for the pizza was quite fast particularly in light of the high demand at the Iron Born Pizza counter. Honestly, each and every pizza on the menu looked to be interesting and full of solid ingredients and you probably could not find a bad one on the menu.",

So the pizza is baked in a rectangular pan so the crust is on the thicker side and it has these incredible crispy edges. Iron Born's sauce is garlicky and delicious, and the toppings are so fresh. It's kind of hard to describe how incredible the pizza is, so you just gotta go try it for yourself.   You'll be looking to spend about $20 for a pie that will probably only feed one person. The price might be a bit steep but the overall experience of this pizza is so worth it!",

When I heard about Iron Born being in the Smallman Galley, and saw the pictures, I had to get in.   Based on photos, my expectations were high and I was not disappointed.   The crust is a bit thicker than the classic \"Buddy's\" in Detroit, but it maintains that fluffy texture inside a caramelized layer of pan-kissed greatness.   The red pie was classic and incredible. I added sausage as I measure all pies against each other with pepperoni and sausage, and it was perfect. My girlfriend had a spicy pie which is balanced really nicely with a honey drizzle. I heated up the remaining slices for a late night snack and it held up great.   I've had some great pizza this year in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit, and this was up there near the top. I'll be heading back next time I'm near the strip. My first trip was damn near perfect.",

We got the veggie supreme pizza and hoped to add meat to it. Unfortunately, they did not offer any non-pork options.   If you're willing to spend a little more for a smaller quality pizza, good place to go. Otherwise, Pizza Hut is a close second.",

All kinds of pizza. Flatbread, Sicilian, Thin crust, NY style, Chicago deep dish etc. I got excited when I read their story. The crust being the star of the pizza, I couldn't wait to order one and dig in. And then when I did, I think my biggest issue was exactly what they're known for, the crust. I wasn't a fan of the flavor at all. I thought the sauce was bland-ish and the whole flavor profile wasn't at all what I hoped for. The peperoni was burnt and crunchy, and I really got no garlic flavor out of it at all. Maybe I just picked the wrong pizza. I guess I should have maybe created my own? probably not since the crust was my problem with it. That's the base. I'd skip it on any other trip to Pgh. Bummer.",

I ordered the Detroit Red Top and my fiance ordered the Spicy Pie. We also got an order of chips and French onion dip. Our order took about 20 minutes. There is a space to sit and wait for your order.   Okay, so the reason you're here.... YES, you want this pizza. It's delicious! It's a deep dish rectangle pizza. Each pizza is 6 square slices of doughy, crispy goodness! I'm already ready to plan my next visit to Iron Born. I'm so glad they now have a second location!",

    "text": "Although I've had pizza all my life, I've somehow made it this far without trying Detroit-style pizza... until now. As a huge fan of thin-crusted coal oven baked pizzas, I really wasn't sure how I'd feel about these rectangular thick crusts, especially since I've had badly made pizza with thick crusts before. However, this crust was light, pillowy, and moist, with a crunchy bottom (as if fried) and edges fused with cheese. The sauce is layered on top of a cheese layer which sits on the crust - also different from typical pizza. The combination was surprisingly good!  It was definitely tough to walk by without ordering a pie. It was entrancing to see staff bring out trays after trays of pillowy crusts and add various toppings before cutting them swiftly into 6 square slices using a rocking pizza blade. There are 8 options to choose from. We went with the Spicy Pie, which comes with hot sopressata, pepperoni, banana peppers, and spicy honey. It was a bit on the salty side, but had a quite flavorful kick to it. The quality was great given the price and portion. Each of these pizzas could probably feed 2-3 people - not bad for $16!  Not sure if this is a relatively new concept or I've just been living under a rock, but it is delicious and I'm glad I got to try it! It is currently located in Smallman Galley, in Pittsburgh's awesome Strip District - I definitely see a future trip back on the horizon.",

Chef Pete Tolman does an amazing job of creating pizzas with 6 cuts that can be shared with 2 or 3 people. My husband and I had \"garden\" style pizza. It is Detroit styled with a very thick crust but not overfilling.  Presentation was spot on and we both enjoyed sharing it. The sauce was flavorful and it was probably one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. You do have the option to \"create your own\" when giving your order.  A brunch pie is served on Sundays. The ordering concept is the same. You are given a number after you place your order and they will bring it to your table.  It is my hope that when Iron Born moves on they will remain in our city as a freestanding restaurant so that more people can enjoy an outstanding chef's concept on a simple dish such as a pizza.  The current class will complete their tenure at the end of May. Be sure to stop in and give them a try!",

I chose to eat at Iron Born Pizza since it was one of the first options I saw, and I definitely don't regret picking it. For $17, I got this massive, cheesy pizza topped with plenty of mushrooms that easily became two meals for me.

So apparently this is Detroit-style za which means it's thick, fluffy crust in a square shape. It's really good, guys. You gotta be in the mood for something different, but if you're in that mood, don't second guess this decision. I wish it baked at a more consistent level throughout the entire pie, the middle could have been more crunchy. The flavor is on-point, however. We got the yinzer (duh). The sauce is on the OUTSIDE of the cheese which is neat to see I suppose but in terms of taste it's the same as it being underneath. Come to smallman galley for the food, stay for the 1/2 priced happy hour drink special 5-7pm. See ya later, raters.",

So I'm happy to find a spot in the Burgh with thick crust pizza, considering most offer just thin crust.   This is actually Detroit style pizza. I think one of the things that makes it special is they bake cheese into the crust that makes it crisp and delicious. Seriously, it's a genious attribute  I've had a variety of pizza, but my fave is probably the white pizza. The ricotta, arugula, caramelized onions, with a slight taste of lemon, really did it for me. I also enjoyed the spicy red pizza, although it wasn't killer spicy, so you won't be left chugging a gallon of water.  I had the red pizza as well, which is good, but if I'm gonna go all in, I want something special rather than just the basics. Friendly staff as well.

    "text": "Have had their pizza in Smallman Galley and it is delicious! Ordered some delivery via Grubhub and can say the same. I got the red pizza, white pizza, and the house chips and dip. The caramelized onion dip was decadent. I could eat buckets of that stuff, so my only complaint would be that I wish there had been more dip since they give so many chips. The dip is super creamy and the flavor of the caramelized onions really came through. The white pizza had a nice tang with the lemon arugula and the red pie was a classic pepperoni. Their crust is delicious! Overall, a new favorite to order pizza delivery from!",

There is a nice contrast between the charred edges/cheese and the supper fluffy/soft inside dough. We got the red pizza no pepperoni for me, which I think was my mistake. The plain pizza was a little--plain. It really needs something to get it to what I would call 5 stars, but my husband really liked the half with pepperoni. If I went back, I would get something with other toppings.   The extra slices microwaved really well. I was surprised.",

    "text": "Iron Born Pizza is a game changer, and I am so happy that this restaurant concept has been made a reality through Smallman Galley. After taking my first couple bites of this pie, I hopped on my phone to research who the creator of such a concept was. His name is Pete Tolman, a Pittsburgh native who spent a short period of time at Alinea in Chicago, which is arguably the best restaurant in the United States (and where I've been dying to go for a couple years).  The inspiration comes from Detroit style pizza. Apparently, Detroit is known for extra-thick, super-crispy, deep dish pizza, and Iron Born delivers exactly that. Traditional Detroit pizza has the sauce on the very top while Tolman's pizza has the sauce towards the top but not necessarily the last ingredient. We tried both the Red Top and the White Pie. The Red Top is covered with pepperoni, a chunky tomato sauce, and parmigiana, while the White Pie is covered with garlic cream, onions, ricotta, and arugula. Traditionally, I like white pizzas, but as the garlic cream was a little too runny for my taste on the White Pie, I actually liked the Red Top better. However, you really cannot go wrong with either choice. Plus, let's not forget that each pie's edges are crispy with cheese.   Based on my stalking of the restaurant's Instagram account, they also seem to offer a number of seasonal and even brunch options. I cannot wait to return to try some of these out.",

It's brunch perfection and I'd eat one everyday if I could.  I'm obsessed.",

Thick crust with just the right amount of crispy edges! I had the white pizza . Topped with ricotta, arugula, sauteed onions and tomatoes it was very flavorful and light! Hubs had the pepperoni and he said the red sauce was amazing. We have also tried Federal Galleys Michigan & Trumbull and Iron Born is #1.We will be back often!!!",

Sharing is a must or get a box to take some home for second breakfast. The brunch pie is cooked in a cast iron and topped with sausage, cheddar cheese, shaved fingerling potato, and a perfectly cooked over easy egg on top. This pie is almost...almost a bit too too sweet with the maple drizzle, but it does lend a nice flavor. Take a break after a few cuts. Together, all the flavors work very well together, but take it slow and enjoy the flavors.  I love how perfectly crisp the crust and cheddar cheese were around the outside edges.

This deep dish crust pizza is full of flavor, the cheese on the edges crisps up to add a little something extra. The Make a Wish pizza is fun and creative, but we had the mushroom and the garden pizza, which had fresh ingredients and packed full of flavor, texture and smells, that makes this pizza an all sense on board experience.   Though don't forget the garden salad. The marinated garbanzo beans and fresh vegetables should not be skipped.  *Note not about the restaurant: When we were there (June2018) was construction on one side and made navigating a challenge, but it is worth it. There is a parking garage about two blocks up, reasonable priced.",

    "text": "As a Michigan transplant, I was excited and skeptical to try some Detroit Sicilian from Iron Born. The venue; Smallman Galley, is a great place to try new foods in a cafeteria/food court style setting. There are workers who come around and give you water and clean up the tables. As far as Detroit Sicilian, Iron Born hit the nail on the head and beyond. This pizza could go toe to toe with any of my favorite Detroit spots. The pizza is a 5/5 for sauce, cheese and airy crispy texture. This pizza is amazing. I tried the white pie and the meat pie. The flavors and presentation were all on point. The price was a little higher than I expected though as I paid almost 40.00 for two six cut pizzas. This is quite a bit more than you would normally pay in Metro Detroit at a place like Buddy's or Papa Romanos. I don't know if that is due to the fact that this could be considered gourmet pizza or the fact that they have to spend a lot of money to rent a spot and pay for things and staff at this venue. I will definitely come back the next time I am missing home and would recommend this to anyone looking to try something different. This is some of the best pizza you are going to find in the Burgh. I give this a 4.5-5.0.",
