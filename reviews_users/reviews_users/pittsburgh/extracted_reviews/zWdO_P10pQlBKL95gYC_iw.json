I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it was. Best salad I've had in a while. I also like the variety of salad dressings. Service was a bit slow but still good. If you are looking for a non-chain place, this is your place . I like the menu. I'm tempted by the deserts but haven't had any yet.",

We noticed there seemed to be a few regulars eating at nearby tables.  Our waitress came by our table once to ask us if everything was okay but spent the rest of the time catering to the regulars and we felt neglected.  Needless to say the food was adequate and filling and the service sub-par. Cute country decor where pro golfer's signed plates adorn the wall.",

Tasty, well seasoned everything. Coconut chicken salad is exceptional; lightly breaded, real coconut, juicy and seared to perfection. Mixed greens in all salads. Housemade dressings to die for. Wedding soup - absolutely top of the heap in the whole region.   Great, now I'm starving.",

This seems to be a popular place with the sunday mass crowd.   We ordered both of the specials.  The first was a crab and veggie omlet, which was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The second was a french toast covered with cherry preserves. These were pretty much pie filling cherries, and the french toast was fairly generic bread. Thus, the flavors on a whole were overpowered by the canned pie filling. If I wanted that, I would make a mountain pie.",

This was a large salad that I could not even finish and came to under $13.  The only complaint that I have is that service was a little slow initially, but it did seem like they were slammed with customers because their food is so good!",

I got the Greek omelette with egg whites, potatoes, and multigrain bread. The potatoes are golden and crispy, so they taste more like French fries than breakfast potatoes. The toast came pre-buttered and the omelette was super yummy. We also split the full stack of blueberry pancakes.  The pancake itself was okay, but the blueberry compote on top tasted delicious! It's safe to say we were all completely stuffed after this meal.",

They are a BYOB (no corkage fee), there's a Wine and Spirits located conveniently a few doors down. They weren't too busy for a Friday night and they seemed to have plenty of staff but the service wasn't great, kind of slow. I had a Club Sandwich which was fine, nothing too exciting about it. The fries were good. I tried the wedding soup too which was pretty good as well. They had a decent dessert selection. The prices are reasonable.",

This restaurant is located right on the main drag and there is plenty of on street parking.   As soon as we walked in the employees were so nice and attentive. We were seated immediately, and I really enjoyed the \"at home\" feel of this place.   For lunch my friend had the wedding soup (which I recommended with the help of yelp) and the Cuban sandwich, which he said was very good.   My sandwich came out and I was not happy with it. The bread was soaked in butter and quite soggy. Also, my \"veggie\" sandwich was really lacking some vegetables. I told my waiter and he did bring more out.. and the manager/owner also apologized but that was about it.   The French fries were very basic, I regret not ordering the sweet potato fries.   I'm torn between giving 3-4 stars, I choose 4 because this place seems like a very established local spot and I think with a little more attention to detail they could easily be 4-5 star.",

    "text": "The review below is from months ago. Nothing has changed except the following: ordered the Italian toast for a $.30 upcharge and ended up paying more for the same pre-toasted then warmed up (and dry) result. Waitress seemed very tired and not too interested. Scrambled eggs were hard, swimming in the grease from the sausage, and not really scrambled in the culinary sense. Since it has been months and nothing has improved this will be our last sojourn to this place for breakfast.   Review from summer 2018: \"I have been going to this place for a couple decades at least and have always given them highest recommendation on yelp and to friends. Even now that we live 20mi away we will still drive down occasionally usually for a special date breakfast. Today we were surprised to find that the menu has changed and a couple of our traditional favorites no longer exist or have changed. These are some of the changes we noticed today. No frittatasone our family favorites and something that most places don't make very well if at all. Omelette is not quite as big nor tender. We no longer are asked for a choice of toast. The toast I got as a default was bagged bread that had a weird flavor as if it were pre toasted then reheated on the grill which gave it an odd flavor. Maybe picking up something off the grill? Unless you are a fan of barbecue chips you may want to skip the home fried potatoes. In the past these were always very lightly seasoned with a touch of seasoning salt. Now they taste like bar fries. The seasoning completely blows out the egg dish on your plate. My wife said the eggs Benedict were still good however she didn't eat the potatoes after trying mine. My suspicion is that no one is verifying the flavors that come out of the kitchen. The server is the last line of defense in a place like this and our server completely missed that everything was not on the plate. IMHO this place is not much different now than what we have in our neighborhood and not worth the drive.  We may try it again in a few weeks to see if they get their stuff together. After that, at least for breakfast, we will probably pass.",

It was a little busy, but we were seated right away at a little table right outside the kitchen. Seating is very cramped and all of the tables are really close together. It took quite a bit for a waitress to finally come over, and when she did you could tell that she did not want to be there. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich in a croissant and my husband ordered the Rueben lunch special. The food came out and I was disappointed to see that nothing else was served with the croissant. No fries or chips or anything. My husband's meal.. oh man. Hardly any meat on his Rueben, and wait for it..... six French fries. SIX! It looked like a kids meal. We honestly thought it was a joke. It sure looked like one. We got out of there and had to stop for more food somewhere else on the way home because we were both still starving.   *I heard that Casey's was under new ownership since the last time I'd been there, so maybe that's why so much changed. I used to love it there but I can honestly say that we will never be going back.",

I noticed all new faces working (and I should mention there were more waitstaff than patrons this time, at 6:30pm on a Saturday night).

We expected to have a little bit of a wait, but were seated immediately. They have your standard breakfast fare, but it isn't quite a \"local diner,\" as it has more of a Bob Evans-type feel.   The positives: I ordered the country omelet, which was filled with mushrooms, peppers, onions, cheese, and ham. It wasn't greasy at all and was pretty good. So was the Mancini toast.  The negatives: The plate of fruit my wife ordered was a major disappointment for her, because it was basically canned mixed fruit with some bananas and strawberries thrown on top. You could taste the acidic juice it was swimming in. We had hoped a local, family-owned place would have fresh fruit. The raisin toast also tasted stale and didn't have any sweetness.   Lastly, the coffee was pretty bad - which is hard to do.  I still give it 4 stars because the eggs were good, which is the main staple of any breakfast anyway.",

Everything is slow. But when you're catching up with friends over breakfast...slow is kind of tolerable. Kind of. However, if I'm in a rush or just want a faster eating experience, Casey's ain't the place, ya'll (see what I did there?).   You know how they say if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck? Yeah. Casey's is really like a diner. Maybe that's very well known? I don't think they claim to be a diner but it tastes like a diner. So, I feel it is a bit overpriced for the quality of food.   Breakfast is tastey. It's a diner kind of breakfast - just more expensive.   Have time to kill? Want to step into coziness? Casey's. Try it.",

This was the first trip for my entire family and they loved it too. My son had the kids cheeseburger and fries. It was very flavorful unlike most kids burgers. My husband had open face roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes. And I had the lunch special, half a tuna sandwich and fries. I added a cup of the wedding soup.

    "text": "This was the worst meal I've ever eaten from this restaurant. I just moved back to Oakmont and the prices of the food have increased, but the quality of the food has drastically decreased. I ordered through UberEats. 90% of my meals ordered through this service are always on par: the food is correct, the food is delicious, the food presentation and temperature are good and the Uber drivers are professional. Each of these categories received 1?star. If I could give no star that would have been my preference. It started with the unprofessionally dressed Uber driver accompanied with an attitude to match. Next upon taking the food out of the bag, I was splattered with pasta sauce due to the fact that the lid wasn't closed on the container. Half of the food was spilled out in the bag. Next was good ole Jerry's Meatballs, advertised 2 for $2.00. The only provided one. Next was the side salad that came with the meal, but the house dressing was missing which was 1.00. Yes, every salad that came with a meal cost a $1.00. Talk about severe uncharging. They also forgot the bread and butter , plus the meal was cold. Moreover , the second meal was supposed to be a medium-well done extra blue cheese bacon burger with crispy fries and pickles on the side. The burger was charred, there was enough blue cheese to cover 1/4 of the burger , the fries were limp and no pickles . Granted I didn't have to pay a delivery fee, but my total was 38.65 pre-tip. I should have went to Burgatory or Michael A's. If a restaurant is going to charge high prices and up charge for food , back it up with quality food , quality delivery prep employees before the food goes out the door . I suggest upgrading your menu and the quality of your food . I reviewed the Uber driver on their app. Please note, I will never eat in your establishment and I will never recommend your restaurant . Thank you .",

The atmosphere at Casey's is likely what keeps people coming back. It's like walking into your gammy's living room and dining room. Except that you have to pay for your food, and no one is asking you who you're dating and why you're not married yet.  If you're from the area, no doubt you'll run into someone you know. You'll have to decide for yourself if that is good or bad - love your neighbors? It's good! On the lamb? It's probably bad!   The one thing that Casey's is known for (at least from my experience or the people I know) that is not that great is the wait time. When you go to Casey's set aside a decent amount of time, because you will be there for a while. I'm not sure why causes the length... Possibly that there isn't enough room to hire other servers? They certainly have fit in as many tables and booths into the room as could legally be fit.",

    "text": "My husband is the from the Verona area so anytime we are close by and could have breakfast or lunch we are sure to stop at Casey's in Oakmont!  My first time there I had the chicken salad on a croissant and about 7 years later I haven't really ordered anything else! It's so good that I can't help but order it every time! I usually add a wedding soup to complete my meal and it's perfect!   The place feels so real. Meaning the older couple across from us was seated and the waitress already knew their order.  People are greeted by name and the staff is friendly to first timers. The decor is like Cracker Barrel but real, not manufactured by a chain. I always feel at home, almost as if I'm sitting in my grandmas dining room.   Sometimes there's a long wait and the bathroom is way too small but it's worth it.",
