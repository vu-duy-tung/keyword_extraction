The food is served cafeteria style and tantalizes you from behind a glass display.  I had the kefta, which was a seasoned patty of lamb and beef. It was on a warm, chewy pita and tasted  great. The light sauce mixed with the veggies (they added a middle eastern style pickled cucumber) were a crunchy, delicious combo.  For dessert we got this mesmerizingly orange dessert that I later learned was called Jalebi. It was light and airy and completely drenched in delicious, sweet syrup. It was interesting to say the least.  The grocery next door is incredible as well, especially the butcher's area. Fresh meat hangs on hooks right in front of you and the people manning the counter are willing to answer your questions. My friend ended up buying pre-seasoned kefta meat for later after one of the employees suggested a serving size for him.  I'll definitely come back here and take photos next time.",

After that I started taking trips over there for some of my weekly shopping items and I made sure to bring my friends there at every chance I got.   I would go and buy my hummus, spinach pies, his special dressing (he sells it if you ask him too) and tabbouleh salad. It use to be he would serve it to you and now he has it set up where you go like you are in a grocery store and just pick things out.    He also has a cute little cafe set up next to his store front. So if you are in the mood for a quick bite to eat this is the place to go.  Salim is very friendly and if you ever have questions he's happy to answer them. It's really the best hidden secrete in the city. I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore but still visit my family and whenever I'm in town I really stock up for my drive home to Bethlehem, PA.",

The gyros are just very clean (a little smaller, if you're not planning on ordering sides and are starving, get two), and fresh tasting.  I love the lamb and tzatziki sauce, there is no better gyro in Pittsburgh.  Salim also serves unbelievable sides.  Tabouleh, baba ganoush, and spinach/feta pies are all tasty.  I used to live right next to the place, and everytime I went in there, Salim was working and was incredibly generous. (I am a sucker for flattery, and he would always address me as \"my friend\").  Now, there is zero ambiance here, so if that's your thing, go somewhere else.  It's also a small grocery store, and Salim don't mess around with lame decor, he lets his food do the talking.  This is honestly more appropriate as a lunch spot, but that's neither here nor there.  I feel like this is a bit of a hidden gem, and thus wouldn't draw any tourist types, but those people are a hassle anyways.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Velvet Underground.  Known to only a few, but had some of the best music at the time (that no one really heard).",

This place is about a block from my apt., and I've passed it about a thousand times, but I never would have thought to stop by if it weren't for Yelp.  (Sidenote: I really need to try the ready-to-eat food at some of the other ethnic markets in the area!)  Based on the reviews here, I decided to try the falafel and the spinach pie.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had falafel--it's been years (don't judge!).  Since I live so close, I got them both for take out, though, as others have mentioned, there is some seating if you prefer to eat in.  Together, they cost under $8.  The older gentleman--who I assume is the owner--made the falafel pita as I waited, and retrieved the spinach pie from the display case (he asked me if I wanted it heated, which I did, so he warmed it up in the microwave).  He seemed very friendly, answering my stupid questions about the falafel pita (yes, it comes with all the fixings), and making conversation with me about my travels in S.E. Asia (I was wearing a Cambodia t-shirt).  When I got home, I promptly tucked into the falafel sandwich and then the spinach pie after pouring myself a glass of iced tea to accompany them. The falafel pita was quite savory, and I enjoyed the variation in texture and flavor that the vegetables and pita offered.  I'd advise eating it as quickly as possible, though, since despite not wasting time in eating it, it was cooler than I'd like by the time I was halfway through.  The spinach pie, on the other hand, remained quite warm, despite that I saved it until after I'd finished the falafel pita.  Although it was a bit soggier than I'd like on the bottom, the flavors were quite delectable--even more so than the falafel pita, in my opinion.  Both the falafel pita and the spinach pie were clearly homemade.  For me, the two of these items were sufficient for a meal, esp. since I've been trying to eat on the lighter side recently.  If you're a heavy eater, however, you may wish to get another sandwich or side.  While I was ordering, I noticed this place serves gyros and Middle Eastern desserts.  I'll definitely keep this in mind for next time I want a gyro or some baklava!  It's awesome to find another great hole-in-the-wall place so close to my apt.--thanks, fellow Yelpers!",

When you need to concentrate, but need to eat and are afraid of ending up with something that either will make you feel over-stuffed, heavy and sleepy or, conversely, leave you feeling hungry in an hour, you need to go to Salim's on Center Ave (convenient parking off-street on the side of the building).   Get a container of Mujadera (lentils and rice with browned onions. He will heat it for you. If you eat meat, you can have some added to it.   Get another container of chilled and flavourful tabouli salad and eat them alternating bites.   Buy a container of Salim's delicious rice pudding, but save it as a celebration for completing tasks/finishing your project or paper.   Buy extra containers of everything if you are pulling an all-nighter. This is absolutely the best study/writing food ever. And so delicious!   Salims also has a whole selection of other wonderful foods - both prepared, and hard-to-find grocery items such as Halaal meats, lokum, and various grains and canned goods.   There is also a dining room separate from the main part of the store so you may enjoy your meal in peace.   Whether you are new to the Pittsburgh area, or needing a new favorite place, Salim's is a \"must experience\" place - one of Pittsburgh's most delightful hidden culinary treasures.",

When you walk in you will first see the shelves of herbs and spices, along with a counter for freshly made food. Look to the left and there's a little doorway leading to a cozy little area with several tables and chairs for eating in, along with some freezers for some halal meats and vegetables.   At the counter, there were quite a few items from which to choose. We chose to go with a create-your-own type of meal, which consists of three items plus pita. Lots of variety--definitely more than you might find at say Kebab Factory. The gyro and chicken were fantastic meats, while the hummus went well with the pita bread. The lentils and grape leaves also made very good sides, and the spinach pie was pretty unique. And all for about $16 (2 of these combos), which is super affordable.  On the way out we bought a small dessert platter for about $12, which came with about 4 pieces of each of the desserts (baklava, mini bites, etc.). Tried some of it after getting home and it was awesome. This is definitely a go-to place for the future for Mediterranean cravings.",

The meat and spinach pies are beautifully prepared, avoiding the dreaded spinach sogginess that sometimes happens. The dessert pastries are light and airy, a must indulge delicacy.

Don't forget to pick out some sides from the fridge in the back though; the hummus is suuuper tahini-y and delicious, the tabouleh is always fresh and bright, and the sleek is a rare find in Pittsburgh, but sooo worth it!

I didn't feel rushed to order and he happily answered any questions that I had. (They accept card but there's a +$0.75 charge for orders under $7).  I got one of the specials: a sandwich with a side of rice or Greek salad with a bottle of water for $7.95. So I got a gyro (beef/lamb) with a Greek salad. And it was out super fast and it was SO DELICIOUS!! There's so much meat and the veggies were super fresh. The Greek salad and the vinaigrette dressing that came with it was fantastic. Everything was really fresh and crisp, I did not feel guilty about eating this food at all. Though the gyro may be a little smaller, there's a ton of stuff on the inside that it more than makes up for it. You get a lot of salad too! I am definitely going to be stopping by here more often and I am so glad that I got to try this place out today.",

This is a great little Middle Eastern Food Store that has serves the standard fare of gyros (chicken and lamb) in a pita or over rice for very reasonable prices. I got the gyro rice plate and the chicken rice plate, which both came with heaps of flavorful meat, a good amount of rice and really fresh, crunchy salad. What really makes Salim's stand out though is that, unlike other gyro spots which serve plain white rice with their food, Salim's makes a spiced rice with vermicelli that perfectly complements the flavors of their gyro and chicken meat.   Note: Salim's doesn't offer curries (as some some of the pictures here suggest) and it is not to be confused with Salems Market & Grill on Penn Ave.",

    "text": "Im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste, but their food is decent. The falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash. They have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers. A great place to get feta, dolmas , tabouli, or hummus. The baba ganouj is excellent.",

    "text": "I am so confused. I had the falafel gyro and it was definitely not that good. (And served with pickles? How strange.) Actually, I want to say that it was \"awful\" just to try to balance out all the other reviews that claim it's delicious--but really, it was simply not very good. Definitely cheap though. Tasted like frozen falafel or something--bland, basically. And pickles?  The baklava was great, though. But if this is Pittsburgh's best falafel then I am a sad man.",
