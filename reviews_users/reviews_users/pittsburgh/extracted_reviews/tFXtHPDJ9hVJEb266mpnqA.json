    "text": "Yes, 5 stars. Albeit my friend and I were only there till about 10pm on a Saturday, however I was blown away.  The wait staff is phenomenal. The bartenders are very nice and quick on their feet. The wings are out of this world.  It certainly does have the sights of a dive bar from the outside, however once you get inside you are greeted by NOT the stench of stale cigarettes, broke dreams, and a wet dream of a Johnny Cash fan. Instead I was greeted by a bar tender asking me if I wanted a drink. I was greeted by the hard wood flooring and the very nice stairs and banister. And it was clean.  It's honestly an all around good place to be. Not too loud, however at 10pm it definitely because more of a party location. Shot girls came in hosting Jose Cuervo or something, the music was turned from a subtle 3 to a not imposing, but definitely audible 7, and again, the wings, man. They were just the bees knees.  The 2 things that suck about this place are the bathrooms and parking. Unless you can hoof it, you have to park 3 blocks away to find free parking, which is pretty lame. And the bathroom (at least for the guys) doesn't have a lock so if you wish to go number 2, bring a friend to stand by the door. Also, no mirror which I thought was more quirky than odd.  I highly recommend this place and look forward to returning to it.",

    "text": "Tuesday nights and I believe Saturday are 25 cent wings and dollar drafts. My friends and I hit this place up nearly every Tuesday when we were still in college. The crowd is mostly college kids due to its proximity to Carnegie Mellon.  The kitchen sink wings are the best wings I have ever eaten in my life. They are made a little different each time. Sometimes they are nice and spicy, sometimes not so spicy. If you manage to get them spicy. savor the flavor. They are also really good when they aren't that hot but even better when they are nice and spicy. The waitresses are really nice and once you go there enough times, they just start bringing over trays of beer when it looks like you are getting low.  The chili cheese fries are also slathered with chili and cheese and are great if you just want to let loose and not worry about going to the bathroom multiple times the next morning.   Actually, if pair the kitchen sink wings with the chili cheese fries, do plan on spending a little more time in the bathroom the next morning. I know I have. Multiple times. When the weather is nice, they open up the back porch so try and grab a table because pounding beers, eating wings and watching footbal couldn't be any better. I always stop by here whenever I travel back to Pittsburgh and I love it.",

As well, it is a sports oriented bar, but the sound is neither set high enough to hear, or low enough to carry on a conversation.  Did not order food, as the window view into the kitchen did not promote delicious or even decent quality food.  Highly unlikely that i will return.",

The place is usually packed with sports fans for any Pirates, Penguins or Steelers game.    The three dollar signs are totally busted.  It should be one dollar sign.  I got two 12 oz microbrews, six hot wings and an entree for $16, which in my opinion is cheap as hell.  The wings come in all kinds of varieties of sauces.  No matter what kind of flavor, they will be nestled in a pool of grease, I promise.  My personal favorite is the \"Kitchen Sink\" which has notes of chili, garlic, parmesean and maybe even Ginger.  Just the right amount of spice, and far more grease than necessary.  Hey, they're only 40 cents each on Tuesdays.  Pass on the food, enjoy the atmosphere.  I sat at the bar in between a homeless Vietnam Vet (who counted out the 40 cent wings bill in change) and two Chinese engineers working on some big project for Carnegie Mellon, while Pirates fans all around shouted at the screen because their baseball team sucks.

The clientele sucks - it's people in their mid to late-20's desperately trying to cling onto their college years by being loud and obnoxious.   It does have a nice back patio that is heated during the winter and smoking is permitted, which is nice. If you are there on a week night, it might not be so bad.  Drink prices aren't anything special and cocktails aren't that strong.  I'd venture a guess that this is a good hang-out spot during sporting events. It feels very sports-bar oriented.  I would say this is a good bar to go with a large drunk group, and that's it. If you are by yourself or in a small group, Cappy's or Mardi Gras would be much better IMO.",

It's a kind of place you would go to meet random people than a place you would go to just hang out with friends.   My friends enjoyed their drinks, so I grant the bar that.  At closing time however, the bartender yelled that we had to get out since it was closing.  They turned on the bright lights, cut the music and stopped the heat to force us out.  So I might not be the target audience.  This is my friend's favorite bar.  I am not sure why.  The frat-boy like atmosphere may be it, but I have always preferred the low-key type bars.",

My friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50. ...really, it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass, it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place, and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city.   The guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called False advertising, and it's a dick move, Mr. William Penn.",

When the bouncer checked his ID, he said he couldn't accept it, to which we responded assuring it was real and offered other forms of ID to prove this. Rather than hand back the ID and send us away, the guy immediately RIPPED HIS ID IN HALF. Can you say destruction of property?

Not including and average 40 dollar tip. Maybe that's why the staff loves me and I get great service. Haha",

    "text": "So a few things really stand out for me at this bar. Been there a few times now, it's definitely a favorite local hangout. I happen to be in the family of fans of the kitchen sink flavor of their wings. Like others who have commented, the crave will creep up at random times. Most places I'm used to have A wing night, they have 4!   Flavors tried: 1- honey cajun- has real honey, 1/5 heat 2- voodoo- an amped up bbq/ hot/ kitchen sink type of sauce in that it's got an unspecified number of ingredients, 5/5 heat (caution fiery hot!) 3- thai chili- alright, not much thai or chili flavor in my opinion but passable, 1/5 heat 4- spicy ranch- good flavor, 2/5 heat Try mixing them up! voodoo with honey combo is gooood... Look forward to trying the other flavors. Yes it's packed, but we always manage to find a table. Service is good, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive. The juke or the bar'J plays good to exceptional ol'school hip hop, alternative, rock, 80s.. you name it. Have heard very obsolete tunes by Biggie, Tupac that most have never heard, that's some music nerdiness I dig. I see a mixed crowd everytime, not just millenials. There is an outdoor space in back, where smokers can do their thing. Overall, great place to catch the game, eat some wings, have some beers, listen to good tunes, and chill ;) Now what is in that kitchen sink sauce?! I've got it narrowed down to garlic, parmesan, soy, some tomato product... so much more, I will figure you out!",

The food was astounding. The cook placed a little bit of his soul in that food. I have been so used to lack of caring of what comes out of most kitchens this gentleman was proud. He delivered it hot to our table and our server was that you would expect from any bar (feel free to get up and go track them down for whatever you need, saves on yours and there head aching). Over all it was 10 dollars a meal, not bad in downtown terms. I also saw the salads a table of men had each was fresh green leaves with a mound of meat on top it. Cannot wait to try one next time around.",

They have a nice tv set up and always have the games on.  Beer selection could be better, although they have about 8 taps with 2-3 craft options.  Apart from the wings I have tried the cheese steak which was pretty good.  One of the drawbacks of William Penn is that seating can be hard to come by, and there isn't really a great place to stand unless you want to go outside to the patio.  Service has always been good and the prices are great.",

These mac and cheese bites are not the traditional ball shape; they are little triangles of heaven served with ranch; they are crispy on the outside and cheesey on the inside. $6.95 is enough for two hungry people or a small snack among 4. Wings (10 for $9.50) are also delicious, would recommend the Honey BBQ. The Kitchen Sink sauce is a little weird, but can imagine some people really liking it. The tots ($3.95) are also great munchies. There are lots of nights with discounts such as half off wings, so def check those out.  Gets crowded with some college students and some older folks as well - might be difficult to get a table.

Ordered cheese sticks, they're an appetizer, but they came with the rest of the food - that took forever. Not sure if they're were short handed or just busy. I will say that there was only two seats open when we arrived but when the table next to us kept asking for their check repeatedly, then I knew I wasn't the only one thinking they're slow. The one positive thing though was that our food was fresh and hot, so score two stars there! Not impressed with the kitchen sink wings, honey buffalo we're ok, also ordered BBQ and had them drop some buffalo sauce which actually was pretty darn good. Other than that, I do not plan or stopping by here again. Cool atmosphere for a bar scene.",

Answering yes to these questions would probably mean you already know about the Tav, but should you not, this might be your place.   Admittedly, it's not one of my regular spots, but I'll submit that when an occasion calls for multiple screens of sports, copious amounts of food and booze, and a energetic atmosphere, the Tavern hits the spot.",

    "text": "Came to William Penn Tavern after an incredibly long day of work and met friends to watch the women's World Cup on the back patio. It was raining pretty hard and the satellite feeds to the game and ninja warrior on the TV next to it were in and out at times.  The bartender was very nice, and although she didn't ask us about ordering food, we eventually discovered that it was $1.25 taco night because she was eating some at the bar while watching TV with us. The tacos were good for the price. Small flower tortillas, ground beef, lettuce, and tomato. Salsa and sour cream in the side.   The atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming, and although on a busier night I'm sure John Taffer might have gone ballistic, there was not much to fuss about as it was basically just my small group of friends and a few others watching soccer on a rainy night.   While I would certainly like to explore more of the menu and drinks offered in the main bar, I'd certainly give William Penn Tavern an A-OK thumbs up.",

This versatile bar has served me for many a purpose, between school events, escape from overfilled Wednesday wine nights that happen down the street, a quick cheap bite or dinner, a staple miller lite under the outdoor tent, or even, to do homework while watching Sunday pro football.   Great people, quick service, hospitable people and a small, yet satisfying menu. Versatile and savory you will stay here long enough to get hungry again from lunch and repeat what my friend Matt did yesterday: Order the best thing he's ever eaten on the menu [the pulled chicken sliders] to his dire end of the night mistake [the Voodoo wings]. Delicious, but I quote: \"there isn't enough blue cheese to eat a dozen of these bad boys\" and people trying to help lighten the load, will suffer the consequences.  Make sure to say hi to the awesome bouncers on your way in, try not to get into a fight to spill a perfectly good full glass of Vodka Redbull and almost take out my chair and you should be good to go.

    "text": "Cheap beer specials, a no-frills atmostphere, and standard pub grub abound. There are plenty of TVs all over the place. It gets packed like a sardine can on weekends. You can't escape the Pittsburgh memorabilia. William Penn Tavern is Shadyside's very own hybrid of sports bar and college bar.  Without a doubt, the highlight would be the chicken wings. The 50-cent wing special (which happens FOUR days a week!) is one of the most affordable and delicious ways to stuff yourself silly. They come doused with your choice of many sauces. The wings are juicy, tasty, and humongous. They might come from giant chickens that could terrorize a city Godzilla-style. I cannot recommend the kitchen sink and spicy ranch sauces enough. If indeed \"you are what you eat,\" there's a good chance I will soon turn into a William Penn Tavern chicken wing.  Other tidbits: The beer selection isn't the greatest--it's the standard Yuengling/Miller/Coors/Bud alongside a handful of craft brews--but at least the cheap beer is actually fairly cheap. There's a dartboard and a foosball table for when you get competetive. The NFL satellite package makes this a great place to spend Sunday afternoons during football season. The patio is decent, and has heaters and a tent for less-than-ideal weather.  William Penn, being his Quaker self, likely wouldn't appreciate it, but if you want some cheap beer, tasty bar food, and a game to watch, this tavern with his name is a solid option.",

The bartenders are awesome, with a great sense of humor, and they even help me with recommendations for new drinks to try out when I'm bored of my same old go to.    Once you get to know the staff they actually acknowledge the fact that they know you which makes you feel like going out was worth it.   Last night, (busy Saturday night) my bartender got so busy he had to jump to the outdoor bar to help out and forgot to bring me my wings, but he quickly apologized, gave them to me for free and even overly compensated with a free drink as well. Great service and they really do care about their customers.   Weeknights are a little slow (what else do you expect?) but weekends are packed starting around midnight, it can be fun, but it can also get annoying with the constant bumping and pushing to navigate through the crowds. But if you have a table either inside or outside with friends you forget how busy it is.  If you're in the area I highly recommend you to stop in for a few drinks and try some snacks. You won't be disappointed!",

This legendary spot in Shadyside (a burb of the burgh), can be found on Bellefonte Street (off the main drag of Walnut Street) across the street from The Yard Gastropub and behind Steel Cactus (home of the Yinzerita). During my tenure of living in Shadyside, I frequented this spot no less than 3 times a week. You get to experience a pure yinzer bar (longer than it is wider) surrounded by the Guinness world record for most bobbleheads in a Pittsburgh bar (made that fact up), Touchtunes (I've spent hundreds on tunes here), several TV's, amazing food, amazing bartenders, amazing atmosphere and a nice back patio to enjoy drinks on beautiful summer nights. This bar was home to me and my friends every Sunday (next to the entrance to the back patio) from 1 pm until 1 am during the NFL football season (as well as almost every other day during the week).  We'd start out with several pitchers of bud light plus some loaded tots (make sure to get the nacho cheese AND the bacon) and then finish off the food portion of the day with some LEGENDARY Kitchen Sink wings.  William Penn Tavern is constantly voted as having the best wings in the city of Pittsburgh and one sauce rises above the rest and that is their Kitchen Sink Sauce.  You get wings loaded up and I mean LOADED up with Kitchen Sink sauce (secret recipe I dared not ask what was in it) and your first bite will be arguably the most memorable wing bite of your life.  One of my friends would just show up for ten minutes on NFL Sunday after doing his cross fit routine (and then tell us all about it) to say hello and house a dozen wings before heading back home to continue his day.  If you manage to find your way to the William Penn Tavern at any point in your life, you must at the least rip several of their Kitchen Sink wings (and if you have some time a few beers as well). One of my favorite things about this hidden gem in the city of Pittsburgh, is the overall atmosphere. There were nights where I planned on doing the typical bar crawl throughout Shadyside on Walnut Street, and just ended up sitting my butt down and enjoying several bud light pitchers at The William Penn before heading home at closing time.  Obviously during Pirates/Steelers/Guins games this spot can get packed (which adds another level of greatness to the overall atmosphere) but as long as you get there at a reasonable time you can find a seat and sit yourself.  The service is impeccable, and very quick (you'll finish one beer and then next thing you know you have another fresh one right in front of you).  Arguably my favorite aspect of this bar, is the William Penn waitstaff and specifically my main dude in the photo below (unfortunately I was never able to get his name).  I've been fortunate enough to have him be my bartender/server dozens of times and each and every time he was just as legendary as the last.  He only adds to the LEGENDARY status of the William Penn Tavern and when you travel to check this gem out, you will see exactly what I'm talking about.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the wings here because they give you a healthy helping of sauce for the wings and the flavors are really tasty. I typically get medium, hot or the \"kitchen sink\" flavor. In my opinion, those are the best flavors!   I would typically go to William Penn on on the 50 cent wing days - the only down side is, you can't take it to go! I would stop by William Penn as a pre-dinner snack (6-8 wings) before I ate my actual dinner.   It was also a great place to stop for dinner before going to the different bars and shenanigans happening on Walnut Street.",

Stood at the kitchen 10+ minutes with not one person acknowledging my existence. After 10 minutes someone mentions grubhub & the idiot in the kitchen says didn't get a grubhub. Guess I'm just standing at your window for no reason. I left.  I've ate here once and wasn't impressed. Probably from seeing the cooks touching my food. The rocking table didn't help either. I rather the kitchen be hidden in the back where you can't see the dirty stuff going on. Won't eat or deliver from here.",

The waitress I had last time was there again and we both recalled the last time I was in Once again she was deftly managing bar tending and waiting tables single handedly ( last time it was a booming Saturday). Her friendliness and bubbly manner adds to people returning! Music playing on the juke box with a large variety of choices   The food was freshly cooked and portions were good. Wings come with a variety of sauces (which I sampled 2,) both good and the fries were straight out of the fryer, all of this with great service (thanks Abby!). I look forward to returning when in the area again. I give it 4 1/2 stars!!",

    "text": "After going through the other reviews listed for this place I can see that a majority of people seem to focus on the 'Tavern' part.  But if you are like me and you are looking for a place to get lunch in Shadyside, you need to reconsider the name and take a venture in here.  While in Shadyside I attempted to stop at several other locations prior to coming here, each of those places were not open for the lunch hour, or if they were to open it was for a late lunch which I did not have time for.  After being deterred by the other establishments I stumbled upon William Penn Tavern.  I had been here before for a drink with friends years ago and scoffed at the idea of getting lunch here.  I should smack myself for thinking that because the lunch I ended up having was twice the amount of food compared to other establishments.  The menu isn't lengthy at all, in fact it is one of the smallest menus I have come across in a while.  Looking at it I just thought I would get a small amount of food that would hold me over until later in the day.  After glancing over the menu I had set in mind what I wanted.  When the bartender came back to me I gave my order and waited.  I ordered the Inadequacy Dog with cheese and some tots.    While waiting for my order to be prepared I finally took a look around the interior to take it all in.  Surprisingly there is a lot of natural light in here, chalk that up to the huge skylight located right over the bar.  Sports paraphernalia lines every inch of this place, I especially like the bobble-heads that are in abundance here.  Sports flags, jerseys, etc. are everywhere.  If that that catch your eye, let your ears do the exploring here.  Several televisions broadcasting various programs or just listen to the banter that takes place between the employees and frequent patrons.  With the delivery of my food I was brought back to reality and thought to myself that my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  The tots were plentiful.  Nice and crispy with each bite you take and unlike some places they do not stick to each other causing the loss of some amazing potato morsels.  Then when I finally noticed the Inadequacy Dog, what I can say about this is that the only thing that inadequate about this is how hungry you thought you were.  This is probably one of the most massive hot dogs I have ever seen.  The menu describes it as a foot-long hot dog, what the menu leaves out is the fact that this hot dog is about double the size around than most foot-longs you come across.  I had to cut this dog into smaller bites.  Not only that, but I took half of the hot dog and a good portion of the tots with me and had that as my dinner later in the day.    Top this all off with some fantastically fast service and it was a perfect lunch that I had.  **I did not partake in the beer selection, nor bar atmosphere later in the day**",

    "text": "\"Eek! Methinks not.\" is the fuck right, random yelp review classifications. Well, congratulations William Penn Tavern, you bloody did it! My friend is currently in the bathroom of his 1 bedroom Shady Side apartment throwing up while I get this review started. Bra-fucking-vo! The wings we just had were made of some hybrid of memory foam, decayed chicken remains, and sadness.   We decided to try both conventional and off the walls flavors, including buffalo, thai chili, and the kitchen sink.  Well, the wings I got were tossed in buffalo sauce. And by tossed, I mean someone painted a wall and and grabbed a handful of breaded dogshit \"chicken wings\" and threw a fastball at the wall, which is the only way they could've been covered in sauce as poorly as they were.  Now let's transition to the tavern's more 'exotic' sauce, Thai Chili. Have you ever had something stuck in the back of your throat that you couldn't get to disappear no matter how much water you drank? Envision that same feeling persisting for ~45 minutes, regardless of how much else you ate/drank/puked. That is thai chili. It's sweet enough to be in the same caliber as a Mike n' Ike, but terrible enough to be that drunk uncle everyone ignores at Christmas. Would never recommend. My soul is still bleeding.  Now, let's get to menu item availability. (And we ordered a whole 3 things, so it's not like we were testing the menu). We asked for a humble serving of tater tots, and we waited with excitement while the chef prepared our pre-meal feast. Roughly 12 minutes after ordering, approximately the time it takes to prepare tots, our waitress stopped over at our table. Instead of being greeted with our crispy tots, we were greeted with the awful news that they \"ran out of tots\". If i was a larger fan of 'Napoleon Dynamite', I most likely would have blown a gasket. However, I calmly waited for my Sodexo brand fries to be delivered, unevenly seasoned, to my table.  I sat, aghast at my lack of tots, and dipped my fries into some cheese that I may only describe as similar to what you may purchase at your step-daughter's youth soccer game that you are not nearly as invested as you should be in. Especially since that bitch ex-wife managed to gain 70% custody of Samantha. What the hell. Note to you folks: don't trust Yelp reviews when you're seeking legal consultation.   I would more quickly advise you to binge drink alcohol for 3 hours straight and reconsider the last woman you loved while pointing a gun to the temple of your head, than I would for you to stop in at William Penn Tavern for a plate of buffalo covered dolphin shit.",

But he was still a Quaker, and he specifically promoted laws that forbade swearing and drunkenness. So I'm not sure how much he'd approve of this bar.  Me? I suppose I'm just underwhelmed. Not a lot of character, but cheap prices. Loud to begin with and louder still with music at an irritating decibel level. The patio is a small sticky slab of concrete. I made the mistake of coming on a Saturday evening, and the whole time I drank my beer (12 taps -- all crap) I couldn't wait to leave.
